0,1d50dx2,AITA for correcting my uncle at a birthday party?,"I (17M) went to a birthday party for my cousin, Red, (8M) hosted by his stepfather, Bruno, (32M) and his other parent, Tulip, (36 AFAB NonBinary) with my mom, dad, older sister, and little brother. Their ages aren't important. It was pokemon themed and I've played pokemon for about 3 years to this point while reading a lot of the manga.  
  
One of the games at the party was a game of 'name a pokemon, if it's repeated or it's not real then you're out,' for cheap and easy prizes just as a time filler. Red wanted me, my sister, and my brother to play so we said yes and there I was, one of three teenagers next to one adult and about ten kids in elementary school. We're about midway through the game when my sister says Dunsparce. That goes through. I say Dudunsparce and I'm eliminated. Uncle Bruno tells me that I said ""The Dunsparce"". I don't want to cause a stir so I head out and the kids are still having fun.  
  
it goes down to the final three and one of Red's friends, Green, says Iron Boulder. Bruno eliminates her because that he's sure that it isn't a pokemon. I ask him ""Hey, can you verify that Iron Boulder is a pokemon?"" Uncle Bruno is insistent so I pull up my phone and show him Iron Boulder. Uncle Bruno apologizes and lets Green back in the game. It goes from a friend named Blue (Klink), to another friend, Yellow (Klang), to Green again, and Green says Klinklang. Uncle Bruno tries eliminating Green again and I have to intervene by showing Bruno what Klingklang looks like. Bruno gets frustrated but lets her in. Eventually Green wins.  
  
Uncle bruno confronts me after and says that I didn't have to embarrass him in front of all the other kids. I'm confused and say ""I just wanted the kids to experience a fair game when you weren't giving them one."" Bruno says that I could have pulled him aside instead of publically countering him when he tried to do his judgement. I say that his judgement was flawed because not only were Iron Boulder and Klinklang pokemon, Dudunsparce is a pokemon too. I show him all three of them and he huffs and storms off to Tulip.  
  
The rest of the party goes rather well, but on the ride home my parents ask me what the kerfuffle was. I say that It was because Uncle Bruno didn't use his best judgement and wasn't judging the game fairly. Dad has no opinion on the subject because he was basically in the bathroom the entire party and mom says that I did a good thing trying to stand up for the kids, but I didn't need to argue that loudly with Bruno. I say that I didn't really shout that loud and it was unfair regardless. Mom says that I still need to apologize for publically calling him out but I point out that Uncle Bruno still hasn't apologized. Mom says that I should just try to keep the peace.

1,1d4n2og,AITA for telling my family I don't want to get senior photos?,"Hi Reddit. I'II start with background info before delving into the scenario. I am a transgender male (17) and I will be a High School senior this August. I live with a family of 3 (aunt, grandpa, and grandma) and my mom lives separately, but I only see her on weekends. She has full custody of me and we have a severely strained relationship since I was a toddler. I won't dig into the depths of our relationship - but she is very controlling, insecure, and abusive. I am closeted about my identity with my mother. My grandfather and grandmother are not as content with it. Only my aunt is slightly more receptive and I say she's alright with it. Right now it is my summer break and my school is sending out letters to make our appointments for senior photos.

SCENARIO: My aunt and grandpa were recently told by our neighbors that her son received an e-mail about senior photos. However, my mom has no awareness of this yet as she pretty much acts absent in my life but only will get involved to manipulate things for me.

My aunt called me out of my room and told me that my mom needs to make my appointment for senior photos soon. I asked her that if there is a possibility I can do it once I turn 18 (in January). The reason why I want to do it at 18 is because my mom WILL force me to dress as my biological sex and that means I have to detransition for my photos. I know she will do this because she is severely controlling of my appearance and has done this multiple times recently - like my birthday photos. I am uncomfortable with how I look as my hair is cut in a pixie-mullet, and my mom will force me to appear feminine in those photos (wearing a dress and makeup). I want to be able to have photos that represent the real me than the fantasy my mom wants. Plus, my deadname will be plastered over these photos which I do not want.

I expressed this concern to my aunt, then my grandpa and her chimed in, began raising their voices at me, and calling me an asshole for only expressing my concerns. I stated my concerns maturely and calmly, and they began telling me that I have no concern for others and l'm acting like an ass because I'm being ""wayward."" They are well aware of my poor relationship with my mother and her behaviors, yet they still treat my concerns as if I'm overreacting. My voice level was not even as loud as theirs, and they started yelling the moment I spoke. I cannot stand up to them furthermore because they constantly belittle my words. 

My wish is to have my senior year to represent myself than what my mom wants to see from me. My words to my mom and my other family members have no value to them. They disregard and gaslight me when I speak up for myself and always have since I was little. As an adult, I will have more liberties to tailor my appearance and have more lead in getting these photos done. Am I the Asshole?

For some background, we have had amazing training for our dog since we got him at 8 weeks old. He still has his moments as we are still and always will be training him but he responds to voice commands very well. My sister in laws dog has never had formal training and is honestly a menace. He is very overly protective of her and Grammy and will attack people and dogs who come too close. Since we got our dog after she did, our dog has been with hers at family events since he was a puppy. Well at first they were fine together but now her dog goes after ours for no reason and our dog will sometimes snap as most dogs would. However our dog is bigger and could potentially hurt her dog if he went farther than a quick snap back. Now here is the issue. My sister in law doesn’t want our dog in the house (Grammys house) if she is home with her dog (she lives a plane ride away). This past Christmas our dog wasn’t allowed because she threw a fit so I had to stay home with our dog. I was alone for hours on Christmas. So my partner and I stated we would fight to work on the dogs relationship so that he (our dog) wouldn’t have to be stuck at home every time my sister in law comes home. Well she is home now with her dog (she will never leave her dog at a boarding facility so he always comes home with her). We went over with our dog and we asked if we could have the dogs together in the house for a little bit to work on training. Well my sister in law doesn’t even want to attempt to train her dog or work on the dogs relationship therefore our dog will always be stuck at home for family events.

Tracy was to drive some of us to a pizza parlor in Westham, while Ariana ordered an Uber for the rest. Due to a mistake, Ariana selected a location in Eastham instead.

At the party, everyone, except Ariana who claimed she wasn’t drinking, indulged in some underaged drinking. During this time, Ariana confessed her romantic feelings for me to Baileigh without naming me but with clear hints. I had a complicated past with a boy named James (17M), who spread rumors about me, tarnishing my reputation. Ariana said it would be embarrassing to date me because of these rumors.

Tracy drove Hannah, James, and Aria to the correct pizza parlor, while I, Baileigh, and Ariana ended up at the wrong one. Despite her earlier claims, Ariana had secretly been drinking and left her purse in the Uber, which had her house keys. The Uber driver agreed to return it but would take three hours. Ariana insisted we wait instead of going to her house directly.

When we realized the mistake, I asked Tracy to pick us up, but she only responded if we would pay for gas. We waited for an hour in the rain outside the closed parlor. Baileigh suggested I use my connections to get us a ride home, so I contacted my friend Thomas (17M), who agreed to help. Thomas arrived before the Uber returned with Ariana's purse. Despite my urging, Ariana wanted to wait for the Uber. Baileigh reassured me it was okay to leave, giving me her house keys and I gave her my jacket for warmth.

The next day, I learned that Baileigh accused me of ""wh*ring myself out"" to Thomas to get a ride, which was untrue. I was subsequently labeled with numerous derogatory terms. Baileigh called me selfish for not understanding her unspoken expectations.

We've been friends for almost 3 years as well. love him dearly, but have been getting upset because he tends to do things or get things for me that HE likes, but not what like. For my birthday, he got tons of mismatching balloons and decorations and wrote weird and silly things on my cake. But don't enjoy random weirdness and humor when it comes to my birthday, like a neatly decorated and themed birthday. I told him l'd love something pink and gold with pretty balloons, not superheros and little boys balloons. He thought it was hilarious and said he would have loved it for himself. 

He once surprised me with milkshakes. For context: HATE chocolate. I've mentioned it countless times. But he came home with two chocolate milkshakes and said how ungrateful was for not drinking mine. I asked him to write down what like and dislike in his phone to help him remember. He just stayed silent 

Today, he came home for lunch with taco bell. don't like spicy food, but love the nacho fries with nacho cheese. He pulls them out with two containers of spicy ranch. I asked if he had any nacho cheese but he said no, just the spicy ranch. I asked why and he said ""because like spicy ranch?"". I reminded him that don't like spicy stuff and that I've always had nacho fries with cheese. politely, calmly, and somewhat sadly asked him again to please write down what like and dislike. He yelled and said he has a bad memory and can't remember to write stuff down. I told him to write it down when it comes up and then he doesn't have to remember anything except to check his notes. 

He hasn't spoken to me since l asked that and I'm starting to feel so hopeless. I feel like I'm asking too much, but want to feel like he cares about what like and don't like. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just an extension of him instead of my own person with my own wants. I want to feel like I can share my feelings without being punished with the silent treatment.

I reminded him that don't like spicy stuff and that I've always had nacho fries with cheese. politely, calmly, and somewhat sadly asked him again to please write down what like and dislike. He yelled and said he has a bad memory and can't remember to write stuff down. I told him to write it down when it comes up and then he doesn't have to remember anything except to check his notes. 

He hasn't spoken to me since l asked that and I'm starting to feel so hopeless. I feel like I'm asking too much, but want to feel like he cares about what like and don't like. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just an extension of him instead of my own person with my own wants. I want to feel like I can share my feelings without being punished with the silent treatment.

TLDR: AITA for asking my boyfriend to write these things down since he can't remember? How do I ask for things without hurting his feelings or making him feel stupid?

9,1d4ju6y,AITA for confronting my parents about their pettiness over my brother not mowing the lawn?,"I 20f have shared an apartment with my 23m brother for the last 7 months. We come from a very nontraditional household, but I won't get into all the details because a lot of what I have to say is biased. Regardless, though only three years apart, my brother and I were raised by very different standards and we are very different people for it. I'm much more outspoken than he is and due to some severe childhood trauma, he had always just done whatever my parents have told him to do. Never asked, just told   
After he became my roommate he started pushing back. Unfortunately, it's still been an expectation that on his days off of work, he goes to their house and does just about anything they ask of him.   


My parents are 53 & 60. My step mom brought 4 of her own adult children to the table. Two of which live with my parents, and my step sister has two kids that are 13 & 12. They're more than old enough to being some kind of chores like dishes or at least their own laundry. But instead my brother is expected to be there doing everything. It's seriously ridiculous.   
He's absolutely fed up with this. He can't ever see his girlfriend, he never has time to clean his own space or cook his own meals. And worst of all, after getting off the phone with my mom yesterday, I found out that my parents are excluding him from an out of state family trip to go see some of our relatives. 

This is a trip my step mom goes on every year. And even when no one else can go, my brother has ALWAYS made time for it. But for the first time in at least five years, my dad is actually going.

They just expected him to be there and when he wasn't they didn't tell him, but instead my step mom told ME on the phone that my brother was no longer going on this pre-planned trip. 

  
My next day off is Sunday and I plan on  going to their house and telling them off for being petty and ridiculous. It's not really my place to get involved, but my step mom involved me the minute she told me and not my brother. He's reasonably upset over this, especially considering the relatives he was going to see are getting to the age where we could lose them at any time.

While I (18, male) do interact with people outside my group, they respect my boundaries and never try to join. However, in the last few months, Sarah has tried to join us. Sarah is a very quiet person compared to the rest of us, and her presence has made things awkward. My friends and I dislike confrontations, so we've tolerated her presence until it became unbearable over the past two weeks. She has been invading my personal space and secretly bad-mouthing one of my closest friends.

Today, Sarah texted me, asking if my friend Bella (18, female) has feelings for Carter (19, male), which I found very strange. During our conversation, she mentioned feeling sorry for barging into our group uninvited. I responded honestly, ""My group has been four for a long time, and while I respect you, it can be challenging with five of us. I appreciate your understanding.""

The discussion escalated as she struggled to grasp that she should leave. Eventually, I suggested, ""It might be good for you to branch out and talk to more people than just us."" She replied that she only hangs out with us at lunch but is aware of our business. I reiterated, ""I understand, but this could be beneficial for you. You could interact with multiple groups and decide who you want to spend time with each day.Besides, you also hang out with us during passing periods.""

11,1d4jcly,WIBTA for not reimbursing my roommate for rent because she's leaving halfway through the month,"Throw away because I don't want this being connected to my normal account.  
So my roommate who I am not on good terms with is moving out halfway through June. We were just discussing the lease addendum to take her off and she noticed the move out date. The lease will be updated for July 1st. I'll call her Claire, and I'll preface that this conversation happened through text.  
Claire: ""Hey that's not my move out date""  
Me: ""I know, legally you're responsible until month end but you can leave whenever""  
Claire: ""They better not be charging me the whole amount for rent""  
At this point I got confused, but not surprised by the comment based on our past interactions. I didn't say anything.  
Claire: ""Are they charging me for the whole month??""  
Me: ""Yes""  
Claire: ""Are you going to reimburse me for the rest?""  
After I saw this I kind of just went, what the hell. For more information, she is moving out willingly, and decided to move out mid month on her own volition. I know she can't make me reimburse her legally as I am in the right. I NEVER agreed or implied I would reimburse her for her moving out mid month. Prorated it would be around $300 that would be owed back to her.  
As we aren't on good terms, and she has made the apartment awful to live in, I do not want to reimburse her. On the other hand, I hate conflict, and she won't be living here. She will still owe me for utilities and now I'm worried she'll try not to pay them for this month (especially the power bill since it is may's power bill, and it is high due to our EPP being paid out). I already planned to prorate June's bills as she'll be leaving which is fair.

It’s not something that came up in the beginning of the relationship and is just something I came to notice. She had NO friends. I mean not even one single friend. She has 6 sisters and 1 brother and they are an extremely close family and hang a lot but no outside friends.

When I first brought this up to her she used the excuses, that she didn’t move here until 15 and switched multiple schools, was poor and bullied often. She didn’t go to college so she said she couldn’t make friends then.

I asked about work and she said she had work friends but keeps work and private life completely separate. I told her she doesn’t think it’s weird or she’s missing out on something to have no friends at all? She said not really because she considers her family her friends. 

I kinda pushed and was like to never have a friend in your life is a red flag, she started crying and saying I’m an AH. That it’s not that easy to make friends, and that the state we are from everyone has grown up together. I said well I mean you met me, so how hard can it be.

16,1d4isvv,AITA for not attending a funeral?,"Last week, a girl I (20) went to high school with and played basketball with (we'll call her Ava) passed away tragically at 22. Ava was two grades above me and we both played the same sport (as a senior she was varsity and as a sophomore I was JV). She was also my ""basketball sister"", which is when an upperclassman is assigned an underclassman to kind of take under their wing for the year so varsity didn't seem as intimidating. This was in 2018-2019 when Ava was my basketball sister and we got close, but not best friends close. My best friend, Lilly (now 21), was closer with Ava since she was on varsity as a sophomore and had a lot of the same close friends as Ava, but they were never super close. Ava was the sweetest person to everyone and no one could say anything bad about her. There is no doubt about that, but we just didn't happen to be all that close. Ava graduated in 2019 and Lilly and I never really kept in contact with Ava after that.

Fast forward to last week when everyone got the news that Ava had passed. I found out on Wednesday morning while I was at work, and Lilly had found out the day before from another friend who Ava was close with. Since it happened so suddenly there was no news of a funeral date anytime soon. All of this was a couple days before a holiday weekend and I had plans to visit my long distance boyfriend (21) for the weekend to be with his family. I was staying there Thursday-Tuesday.

For some added context, Lilly has never been a huge fan of my boyfriend which I don't blame her for because he has made some mistakes in our relationship but she tends to take it too far sometimes. For example, if I post on Instagram or Tiktok and he is in the post, she wont like it. She'll roll her eyes any time I mention him and tends to talk bad about him quite a lot in front of me. Like I said, I don't blame her but I would be lying if I said this didn't get under my skin sometimes.

Anyways, I found out on Saturday that her funeral was going to be on Monday morning (ending at noon) via a Facebook post. Since I was approximately 3 hours away from home and hadn't heard from anyone else in my circle that they were going, I didn't change any of the plans I had with my boyfriend's family that week. On Monday at 11:40 am I got a text from Lilly saying, ""Are you not coming to Ava's funeral?"". I responded, ""I had stuff planned with \[boyfriend's\] family or else I would've been there. How is it going?"". Her response was a thumbs-down reaction to my text. I haven't heard anything from her since and she's been leaving all of my other social media messages on read (one's not related to the funeral). I feel horrible for not being there but I also feel like it's not fair to be mad at me when I didn't even know that Lilly was going. AITA?

And me and lil bro were helping clean up to be nice, I asked my lil bro if he could please move out of the way of the dish washer for a sec (he was putting dishes in it) so I could put my extra dishes in, he told me “no” and too “cope and seethe” I rolled my eyes and carried on, like 2 minutes later I asked my mom if there was anything else I could do to help and she said I could put the shreded cheese into a baggie, now beside the dishwasher there are drawers were we keep stuff like small bags, since my lil brother was still in the way and he had told me to “cope and seethe” after I asked him to move 2 minutes ago I didn’t bother asking this time, and he tried to slam my hand in the drawer, I screamed and I blew a fuse because my brother had just tired to slam my hand in the drawer , and for some reason everyone got mad at me for freaking out even though my little brother just tried to slam my hand in the drawer, meanwhile he was claiming I should have just asked him to move out of the way, (bruh I asked you two minutes ago and you told me to “cope and seethe”) my mom just Said “I hear you and I believe  you but you need to stop escalating, I’m still eating and it’s my anniversary” I screamed at everyone (Exept my big bro’s gf because she’s really nice and she tries to stay nutrual in these situations) in short I stormed off and like 5 minutes later my mom told me in short I was the problem because I  escalated the situation and that it wasn’t fair to her because I “ruined” the dinner after I pointed out how it wasn’t fair that I was punished for freaking out because my brother tried to hurt me.

18,1d59rj7,AITA for doing nothing for my 18yo SS?,"Very, very long story short…. My husband and I have been married for 15 years. We have 3 sons 23, 18 and 10. The 2 elder boys are my husbands from a previous marriage, but I have been in their lives for 17 years, while their mother has little to no contact/input, by her own choice, and their choice as they got older. I have always acted in a parent-type role, cooking, doing school-work, buying clothes, attending sport and school events, but I have never been called mum by them and always encouraged them to think of their bio-mum as mum. Our 18 yr old is very disrespectful and verbally aggressive towards me, but only when my husband or older son are not around. This has been a thing for about 3 years, and has become increasingly more frequent. Approximately 3 months ago, after being asked to put away his laundry, for the umpteenth time, he unleashed on me. I was called every name under the sun, f this, f that, f’n b@tch this etc etc. Not to mention the obligatory, you’re not my mother etc etc.
So I said, “That’s fine, we’re done. Do not ask me to do things for you, if that’s how you feel”.
So I haven’t. If I’m cooking, I cook for everyone, but otherwise nada. I’ve just stepped back. 
My husband thinks I’m being unfair because he’s a teenager and he gets frustrated. But this isn’t the first time he has behaved towards me that way. He often behaves the same way towards his younger brother, but again NOT when his father is around, to the point where the 10 year old will also steer clear when dad is not at home. He is always very careful to speak nicely when his father is around, but reverts to snarky and disrespectful when he is not, which has been observed by other people, who have also told my husband.
By stepping back and not engaging, I’m just trying to protect myself from further abuse and giving 18yo exactly what he wants.  I think 18yo has some issues that need addressing, however I’m not going to place myself (or my younger son) in the firing line because someone else is frustrated. I think by excusing the behaviour, my husband is making the behaviour acceptable.

19,1d59oa9,AITAH for being cold and distant to my dad?,"My parents are going through a divorce atm and it's going about how you'd expect (arguing here and there and overall palpable tension 24/7 when they're both at home). My mother has always suspected my dad of speaking to other women especially ones in Macedonia (we live in Australia now). On Mother's Day, he was home while mum was working and we were sitting together in the lounge room when I noticed every time that he'd get a notification on his phone, he'd jump up and check what it was or who it was from, which I thought was suspicious. When he got up to go somewhere I checked his phone and the messages and he was messaging some woman about mattress sizes which was weird. Then, he says he's going somewhere and leaves which is fine until he doesn't come back for 4 days. He then messages me every day while he's gone asking about why I'm ignoring him and I said we'd discuss when he returned home. 

Upon his return, he said that he couldn't stand seeing mum as ""there was nothing left of their marriage"" now that the divorce was going ahead (their marriage was over years and years ago). He then went on to say that he couldn't bare to tell me that he was leaving yet he told my mum, who he couldn't bare to see? Which was confusing. 

Anyway, since that happened nearly 3 weeks ago I've been very cold and distant from him as I don't really know how to forgive him for what he did considering the only reason he came back was because I said I was mad at him for leaving. 

He claims that the place he stayed in wasn't nice at all but that's not the point of why I'm angry.

There are only a few things that bother me a little, and I feel guilty because I’m afraid I’m imposing my COCD (contamination OCD) on my siblings. 




Rules such as, if they hadn’t showered that day they can’t lay on my bed to play (to be honest I ignore this rule for the most part just for their comfort) and we have a gaming chair; they can’t lay their feet on the PS table unless they’re wearing socks; and can’t sit on my bed/chair if they’ve been wearing their clothes outside to school or anywhere outdoors. 




For the showering rule, I’d been trying to encourage them to wash their beddings more often so I can be more comfortable with having them lay on my bed if they hadn’t showered; and keeping their feet off my bed. 




My siblings aren’t dirty at all and I acknowledge that, they take hygiene and sanitation seriously and my mom and I are often don’t have to remind them to brush their teeth and wash their faces and hands. They may not wash their beddings often but we are a busy family with loads of laundry almost every day multiple times a day so they don’t pay attention to washing their beddings very often, still I know they have good hygiene for kids their age.

Some of her professors have been salty with her because she has expressed that she wants to transfer for that reason. She has been so focused on this that she failed a class last semester.

She still wants to desperately goes and is still trying by contacting the offices over and over about scholarship even though they said no. She asked her dad for $16,000 and he won’t give it to her, so this made her really upset. She is also upset that her friend in NY has an internship and said that it’s because she’s in New York. 

I helped her by making the phone calls and sending the emails about scholarships and doing the research, which all came back negative to me. 

I have told her that we should maybe wait, save some money and go in the future but she is convinced that it’s the key to her success. She is now trying to get a loan outside of FASFA that will be extremely expensive and assumes she can get a co-signer (her cousin)

She thinks that me saying that rent is expensive, having a car makes no sense, and that we should stay here for a while, etc. means I don’t support her, that we are stuck here and that it worries her. She thinks that I’m going to restrict her.

24,1d57vhz,AITA for wanting the same expectation for my friend?,"
Before we get into this I need to add some quick backstory. Back in July of 2023 me and my friends went to campout and check out this theme park.  This trip was all my idea and because of that I had to plan everything. This means I had to rent the campsite for a couple of days, figure out the route, tell everybody where to buy the theme park tickets, pick out the tent, and do a day to make sure things were working. Like to make sure that the tent didn't have any holes or the stove worked, things like that. The only help I was given from my friends was to ask about scheduling so I could figure out a date. The three of us also planned out meals. One of them was also there to make sure that the tent worked. Most of the stuff I did with the other 2 friends were about 25% to get this trip done. Everything else took about a month to finish and that stuff took around 1 week. Whenever I asked if they could help me with the other 75% they said no because ""this was my trip"" and ""my idea"" which is fair.

Now that you're caught up on last year let me tell you about this year. One of those two friends wanted to do another camping trip this year (2024). I thought that would be great. My friend is planning this out because this was his idea. He then asked me to help him out with some aspects mostly from finding a campsite and renting it. I said no because this was his idea, and last year nobody helped me out with any of the camping aspects of the trip. He got mad at me saying that this was actually my idea because I said I wanted to do something like this again. I checked all of the messages as far back as I could go and used the search option in the messages app. I typed in key words like ""campout"", ""Lost Island"", and ""waterpark"". After I checked there was nothing that showed that I wanted to do another theme park trip. There was however messages of me saying that I wanted to do campout in another spot. I also mentioned doing a high adventure trip in Buena Vista, Colorado. So yes I did say that I wanted to do another camping trip but not another theme park trip. After sending this to him he got even more pissed off and started screaming at me over text. He called me a  ""nickpicking manipulator"" because I decided to fact check him. He still insists that this was my idea and that I should help him. He then gave me an option to help him or be booted off the trip. He later said that I wouldn't do everything just help him out when needed.

 Now I'm conflicted because I want to go but I'm tired of him acting like this, and if I go he would keep being this way. As
I said I want to go so saying no would mean I wouldn't get to go, but I would be putting my foot down and saying I'm done with him acting like this.

The AITA part is should I put away what happened last year and just work to get this figured out?

He is great, everything about him is great. He gels well with my family and friends, and they love him very much. His parents, on the other hand, are very conservative and judgmental, even though they try to come off as cool.

We live in a different state from our parents and visit them occasionally. Here’s the catch: my home is a 6-7 hour ride from his home, so every time we go to my place, we also go to his place for a few days. For example, if I stay for a week at my home, I will stay a week at his home. He loves being at my home because my parents are very chill, and he enjoys spending time with my siblings. However, whenever we go to his home, he lies to his parents and says he came directly to see them, denying that he stayed with me at my home. Sometime we go visit his parents directly then go to my place and he lies to them about this as well.

This has happened several times. He says he cannot make his parents understand that he stays with my parents for a few days because they are judgmental and he cannot bridge that generation gap. This is common in my country where parents of the husband feels superior and feel like it is only the wife's duty to imbibe into the family of husband and not vice versa. He is the only child to his parents and they feel jealous when he shares his time with my parents. They have felt that about me as well and has spoken quite a few times of how I changed him and everything. It is just jealousy which they are never afraid to show. My parents are the same age as his, but they have evolved over time. I do not expect him to change his parents overnight, but this happens every time.

It does not cause me any harm that he lies because he eventually stays with us, but it feels bitter that he treats this as something to lie about. It makes me and my parents feel weird. They do not say anything, but I feel like he should stop lying and put his foot down.

We have been married for two years after a seven-year relationship. He is great, everything about him is great. He gels well with my family and friends, and they love him very much. His parents, on the other hand, are very conservative and judgmental, even though they try to come off as cool.

We live in a different state from our parents and visit them occasionally. Here’s the catch: my home is a 6-7 hour ride from his home, so every time we go to my place, we also go to his place for a few days. For example, if I stay for a week at my home, I will stay a week at his home. He loves being at my home because my parents are very chill, and he enjoys spending time with my siblings. However, whenever we go to his home, he lies to his parents and says he came directly to see them, denying that he stayed with me at my home. Sometime we go visit his parents directly then go to my place and he lies to them about this as well.

This has happened several times. He says he cannot make his parents understand that he stays with my parents for a few days because they are judgmental and he cannot bridge that generation gap. This is common in my country where parents of the husband feels superior and feel like it is only the wife's duty to imbibe into the family of husband and not vice versa. He is the only child to his parents and they feel jealous when he shares his time with my parents. They have felt that about me as well and has spoken quite a few times of how I changed him and everything. It is just jealousy which they are never afraid to show. My parents are the same age as his, but they have evolved over time. I do not expect him to change his parents overnight, but this happens every time.

My brother loved the fact that our mom had no rules for him so he went with her. I abided by the custody agreement because I had no choice in the matter. My mom loves us both but she dotes on my brother like he farts perfume. 

My dad kept the house. He had to buy my mom out. It was an old house built in 1953. It had old wiring and was really less than suitable for modern life. What it did have though was a huge yard that was great growing up. 

My dad passed away during COVID. He left everything equally between my brother and I. I wanted the house. I told my brother that we should tear it down and put in infill housing like that neighborhood is zoned for. He just wanted money. I bought out his half of the house at the market value. It was sold as a teardown. He took the money and bought a car and went on a vacation. He still has money left. 

Then I had the house demolished and built a fourplex. Each unit has three bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms, a small yard, and a garage. I kept one unit for myself  and rent each of the other units for $2,000 a month. My mortgage is $1,800 a month for the entire thing. So basically I live free and bank $4,000 a month.

I'm lost. I offered him a partnership, I paid a fair price, I offered to sell him a unit, I did everything to try and be fair. He thinks I tricked him because I get ""free"" money every month. 

Our mom said she would be cutting me out of her will and giving everything to him if I didn't give him a unit or the income from one. I agreed that was fair and said that I would no longer feel the need to contribute to her upkeep or retirement when the time came.

33,1d56g7i,AITA for leaving my mom when she needs financial help?,"I (19F) is living at home with my Mom (58F) and my younger sister (13F). I'm currently going through exams, and graduating this summer, and after that, I was going to move out and work, but decided a few months ago that I would rather stay at home for another year and just find some work around here. Right now I don't have a job, because of my exams and just pressure in general.

About my mom, she has had her own webshop for more than 20 years, though switching it up a few times, and has therefore always been a stay-at-home mom.

She has made some not-so-good decisions throughout her life, and now she owes a lot of money to the bank and in taxes. Because of this, the government is going to take away her VAT-number, which means she can't run a webshop anymore.

She is obviously devastated, not only is she losing her dream job that she loves, but she is soon going to be an unemployed single mother.

She is also scared about what will happen after her VAT-number is gone because that is just the beginning.

That was the backstory, now to the AITA-problem.

To get some extra money she is going to sell her car. We live far out in the countryside, and me and my sister go to school in the city, so it's quite a problem without a car. My mom then sat me down and said that I needed to buy a car, which would become our family car, and I needed to basically be a personal chauffeur for my sister since my mom would be busy trying to find a new job.

I was not okay with that. I know it is my mom and I should help her out, but I'm going through a really mentally exhausting period right now with exams, plus I don't have a job, so I have no idea how she expects me to pay for a CAR.

She then got furious and said I was a brat and selfish and that exams are not nearly as difficult as what she is going through.

I would love to help her out ofc, but it is just not possible for me at this moment, and I don't quite understand, how she doesn't see that. I have 2 older siblings (21F) (29F), who are both way more financially stable than I am, but she said she doesn't want to bother them.

Later she also asked me to pay for our streaming subscriptions, and I said I'd think about it. When I told my friend, she said I could just use theirs, since they had an extra spot on their account. When I told my mom, she said again that I was selfish and that I kept turning my back on my family, since I would be the only one with access to the streaming services now.

I've been talking to some close friends about this, and they all say I should focus on myself and that my mom is the brat, not me. It is my friends though, so they are kinda unqualified to take a side.  
I have been thinking about moving after I graduate. Again, it was the plan until a couple of months ago, but I'm scared it will damage my relationship with mom too much to fix again.

I was not okay with that. I know it is my mom and I should help her out, but I'm going through a really mentally exhausting period right now with exams, plus I don't have a job, so I have no idea how she expects me to pay for a CAR.

She then got furious and said I was a brat and selfish and that exams are not nearly as difficult as what she is going through.

I would love to help her out ofc, but it is just not possible for me at this moment, and I don't quite understand, how she doesn't see that. I have 2 older siblings (21F) (29F), who are both way more financially stable than I am, but she said she doesn't want to bother them.

Later she also asked me to pay for our streaming subscriptions, and I said I'd think about it. When I told my friend, she said I could just use theirs, since they had an extra spot on their account. When I told my mom, she said again that I was selfish and that I kept turning my back on my family, since I would be the only one with access to the streaming services now.

I've been talking to some close friends about this, and they all say I should focus on myself and that my mom is the brat, not me. It is my friends though, so they are kinda unqualified to take a side.  
I have been thinking about moving after I graduate. Again, it was the plan until a couple of months ago, but I'm scared it will damage my relationship with mom too much to fix again.

34,1d56f34,AITA for not going to my cousins graduation party?," So my cousin just graduated high school and is having a graduation party. I don't wanna go for a few reasons, I don't like parties or crowds no matter who the person having them is (I'm graduating this year too and not having a party). A few of my cousins will be celebrate it since a lot of people are graduating this year too. The main reason I don't wanna go tho is because I will know absolutely nobody, I don't even really talk with my cousin a lot. (The one that's graduating)


Last time my family was at there house me and him spoke like 5 words to each other the whole hour we were there and that was when it was only me, my parents, and my siblings. This time it's going to be a whole huge party so I feel like we aren't even gonna speak one word to each other the whole time. Plus it's gonna be a lot of people I don't even know so I'm probably gonna be just awkwardly walking around doing nothing for a few hours.


Usually I don't see family that much besides twice a year (during the summer for a yearly reunion thing and during Christmas) so my mom is trying to force me to go to spend more time with them because their family. I don't want to go tho because I don't wanna have to drive over an hour to get to their house just to awkwardly be sitting around for a few hours doing nothing.

35,1d56bhe,AITA for suggesting my sister wear a different bridesmaid dress.,"I am getting married this year! I’m really excited. It will be a small (30ish people) wedding which I’ve given my guests a year to prepare for. My fiance and I have invited all our close friends and they’re all going to make the effort. I’ve asked two close friends and my two sisters to be my bridesmaids. 

One of my sisters has a few personality quirks. They involve lying, manipulation and general lack of empathy however she is my sister and I love her so I want her to be one of my bridesmaids. It’s been 5 months since i’ve asked her (and she said yes) to being my bridesmaid and agreeing to wear blue. The other members of my bridalpsrty are going to be wearing lovely but not uneconomical dresses (~$100). Normally I wouldn’t care how much a dress costs, however yesterday my sister sent a screenshot of the dress she will be attending in. It’s a $20 dress from wish.com, which (and this is the important part) has really negative reviews including ones that mention it’s more of a beach dress or how it didn’t match the photos online. 

I know how shopping online is; very hit or miss. My sister has left it a bit late and has come to me with this dress, which A) probably won’t be as she envisions and B) isn’t really flattering. I’ve suggested to her that she has time to find a new dress as this one has poor reviews, to which she replied with “if it’s not good enough I don’t have to be your bridesmaid”. 

I love my sister. This really hurts. AITA for suggesting that she get a better dress?

36,1d55nss,AITA for not inviting my friend to my mom’s baby shower ,"For some backstory, my mom had her baby shower this past weekend and she had told me I could invite a friend if I wanted because many of my friends are close with my family. Also, although I have a relatively large friend group, it’s kind of separated at the same time if that makes sense. I’m the original friend that kind of brought the groups together. So basically there’s like 2 mini groups in our larger group.

At first, I wasn’t going to invite anyone because it was only a few days before the event but I made the mistake of talking about how excited I was for it in front of my group when we were hanging out. One of the girls sort of invited herself but she is one of my friends that is very close to my family so I was okay with inviting her. 

Last minute she had to cancel but I had already reserved a spot for her so if I didn’t bring someone then I would have to pay a fee. So I invited another girl, we’ll call her T, from the other part of the friend group because she was my next choice of who was close with my family. 

Then, about a day or two before the shower, a girl from the same group as T, we’ll call her K, blows up at me because I had accidentally told one of our friends something she didn’t want her to know. I admitted that was totally wrong of me and honestly just thought she had told her already. I apologized many times, keep in mind it was kind of a small thing, but she kept arguing. But, come to find out from T,  K was mad because I didn’t invite her to the baby shower.
I started to find out that she was talking smack about me behind my back because of it. The day of the baby shower came and I was bummed out because of the whole situation, I still had fun supporting my mom of course but I just really didn’t like how she had to make a conflict stem from something I was really excited about. 

A couple days after the shower we still weren’t talking but I decided to try to make up for the sake of our friendship. I texted her and asked if we would be able to meet up to talk for a bit. The first red flag was that she had agreed and then the day of, once I was already there and waiting, she cancelled and just said we should call tonight instead… I said whatever and just texted her instead. I was already mad because I felt like she placed no importance on us making up and even staying friends. Long story short, the argument got heated because she kept saying, and I quote,”I’m not mad you didn’t invite me, I’m just saying if you don’t invite everyone then don’t invite anyone”. 
Just fyi, my reasons for not inviting K instead were simply 
1. She’s only really met my mom like twice
2.I didn’t feel comfortable inviting so many of MY friends to something that wasn’t even my event 
3.she’s  a bit more introverted compared to T and I didn’t want her to be uncomfortable with so many people there

37,1d55lz8,AITA for telling my friends that i dont really like them forcing Taylor Swifts music onto me and another friend?,"Recently, my (15F) friendgroup (4 people directly involved) has been kind of divided into two groups: The two that really like Taylor Swift (let's call them A and B) and the two that dont really like her (me and C). 

So A and B are real Swifties. They buy her merch, buy records and books about her. They listen to her songs and albums around the clock.

Me and C usually have a neutral stance on her: Her songs are completely fine. Not really our favourite genre of music but its not that bad. 

Lately, however, all that A+B have been talking about is the new Album TTPD. It's gotten to the point that almost every third conversation is about it and they've started to ignore all the other topics to talk about no matter how much C and I try to change the subject.

They keep trying to make us listen to her music to like it more, but honestly, for me it has the completely opposite effect: I am starting to dislike her more and more. I can't speak for C but she looks annoyed as well. It has gotten to the point where, when i hear her music my mood instantly goes sour and i get annoyed.

Also in class, they've started to quietly sing her songs, which is very distracting. (We have told them and they stop for like 20 minutes before starting again)

We had a few sleepovers since the release of TTPD and what happened is this: They keep on looking at their phone to stalk Insta for new pictures and announcements. C and i have made it clear that we would appreciate it if they didn't look at their phone all the time when hanging out with us. We have been repeatedly ignored.

So after being ignored multiple times now for months, i kind of snapped at them. 

This is where i might be the AH, because i told A+B that not everyone likes TS and that if they really want me to like her, then they should leave me alone about her music and let me discover it on my own. Also that they are really annoying me for talking about her 24/7 and that im a fan of other bands but atleast im not trying to force my music taste onto others.

This resulted in a sour atmosphere in the friendgroup and I really dont know how to proceed.

I know what its like to adore a band or a musician, but i never talk about my music interests unless im asked about them first.

I am friends with these girls, Hayley(21F), Amy(20F), & Julia(20F), & have been since we were young. Amy & Julia are twins. We are all at SEC schools. I go to one about 7 hours away & they all three go to one of the nearby SEC schools in our home state.

Throughout HS, Hayley was in an on-&-off relationship with a guy. During one of their HS breaks, Hayley had HU with a guy, Stephen(20M). It turned out not going anywhere but a **one-time HU**. She & the ex get back together.

Hayley idolizes the idea of being an independent woman who doesn't need a man. But, she doesn't have the best taste. So she keeps her dating life private. She also tends to flirt/HU with *other friends*' crushes, exes, old or current HUs, etc. 

Onto the short backstory about the boy. Stephen became my co-worker a couple of summers back. At the time, we were both in relationships. I knew who he was bc of Hayley. We became friends that summer, but lost contact when we started college.

Last year, I got back in contact with Stephen. He expressed interest to hang out when I came home for summer. I called Hayley & *asked* if it made her uncomfortable **in any way**. She laughed & said that I had the green light. Stephen & I hung out all summer. I started to fall in love with Stephen. One night, I told him I was starting to fall for him & he told me he cheated. It was over at that point.

Then I found out he gave me Chlamydia. So I told Stephen & he was apologetic. We talked about starting over. He ended it 4 days later. I *confided* in Hayley. 

When we all went back to school, Hayley would tell me about random times she would run into Stephen, now that he had transferred to her & the twins' school. I was confused as to why she'd mention it. When the three of them came to visit me this year, I saw *his name* on Hayley's texts. She tried to brush the whole thing off as no big deal. Hayley called me about 3 months later to tell me that he had asked her to be his date to an out-of-town date party *&* *that she was going*. Her words: ""You're gonna be so mad."" On the phone, I acted like no big deal. But later I went off.

I told her that I had no idea why she would think it was okay to say yes & go on this trip. She'd be **sleeping in the same bed** as him. I said that it was disrespectful bc *she knew it'd hurt me*. I emphasized that I did not see the point of now knowingly putting our friendship at risk just to go out of town for 36 hours. She still went on the trip after apologizing, which kind of threw it out the window.

41,1d551bl,WIBTA for not returning a chipped cat?,"in october of 2023, what my mom and I presumed to be a stray catshowed up at our doorstep. the little thing looked super disheveled and skinny, but was super friendly and got along with our one other adopted cat. she seemed rather young, maybe only a year old or younger at the time, but it also appeared that she was a stray for a while because of how sparse her coat was. 

anyway, we let her eat the with our previous cat and use the litter box, etc. but still let her out regularly. our other cat is already an outdoor cat per her choice, she loves the outdoors and always comes back in time for supper, so we just let the new cat live the same lifestyle. this is important to mention because technically she could leave at any time. 

another important mention is that i checked pawboost to see if any local owners have been looking for a cat that matched her description. i checked in a 20 mile radius and went back probably 4-5  months to be extra sure. there wasn't any, even cats that roughly matched her color had pretty distinct faces that clearly weren't her. that helped us come to the conclusion that we thought she was a stray. 

within about a month, or even sooner, she responded to the name we gave her and always comes when called. by around december/january we looked into getting her spayed. there is a local place in which we got our previous cat spayed, but they were booked up now and the soonest appointment was for the end of may, just a few days ago. well, we took her in and explained that we don't know her exact age and gave all the info we had (disclosed that to our knowledge, she was a stray). we also got her vaccinations. when we picked her up they told us that she was about a year old, had already been spayed, and was actually chipped by a previous owner and that we should look into that. we were given the chip number too. 

my mom is really against looking into it because she does not want to give up the cat. i don't want to give up the cat either, but morally i feel conflicted. i looked up the chip number, and basically there is no way to get in contact with the previous owner other than surrendering the cat. 

if we do the math, the cat is roughly a year old, cant be more than two, according to the vets. we took her in beginning of October, it is now the end of may. we have had her for 8 months, probably around half or possibly majority of her life. i am on the fence about submitting my info and saying the cat has been found on the chip website, however some other family and my SO are pretty much against it and cant stand the thought of me giving her up and living with out her.

43,1d54o8s,AITA for telling my friend I don’t want to talk about a particular topic that gives me anxiety,"TLDR: Friend (32F) repeatedly asking me (31F) about a topic (my wedding) even when I have previously mentioned that it gives me anxiety and is in the back of my mind that I don’t want to think about right now. So I told her that I don’t want to talk about this topic and she has been ignoring me ever since 

I have a friend who used to be really close to me but we drifted apart once she started hanging out more with her fiancé’s friend group and having observed lack of effort on her part in our friendship (i.e stood me up for her fiance’s friend group, last minute change and being late to meet ups)

We haven’t been keeping as close in touch as of late. And recently I decided to tell her about my engagement, she asked so much about my wedding plans (partly due to her wedding is coming up) so I also explained how I don’t want to think about the wedding in near future because I had other problems to think about, and that it is not a priority thinking about it is giving me anxiety

Regardless, she proceeded to bombard me with wedding reels, which I don’t really appreciate because I’ve already expressed how it’s giving me anxiety before. at one point she texted to ask me if I had shared the engagement news to others. So I took the chance to also tell her that I don’t feel like talking about my wedding at this stage (if it happens) because my partner and I had other priorities at the moment. And she just blue ticked me ever since (she does this often)

The reason why I also don’t want to share too much is because this friend has the tendency to ask questions about you but when it’s your turn asking she will shut down or shift to other topics (she’s very private) and that always left me feeling like I divulged too much information and even a little used. 

I suppose some of you reading might wonder why we are still friends. I guess decades long of friendship is still hard for me to get over even when maybe we’ve both outgrown it.

I am currently in my home country visiting family and she is in hers, we are meeting up in our country of travel and starting our trip.

She has been wanting to get an Invisalign treatment done and decided impromptu to get it done in her home country a few days ago (6 days before the trip). I already thought this was rushed but whatever, her choice. Today (2 days before the trip), her dentist told her she has to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed because of overcrowding, and it has to be done before getting the Invisalign in.

When she told me this I got upset and basically catastrophized that the trip was ruined. The first few days are going to be painful and she's not going to want to do anything, then the rest of the trip is going to be a struggle trying not to open the wound in her mouth, on top of keeping it clean after every meal.

She explained it's a different procedure (piezoelectric surgery) and the recovery time + swelling is way less than normal. I called her selfish for deciding this without telling me, and expecting me to adjust to her decision without even talking to me, when this trip was for both of us. She called me an AH for not being supportive and that it won't be that bad and we'll still be able to do everything. I'm not convinced since my wisdom tooth extractions knocked me out for 3 days and I couldn't imagine travelling and doing stuff in that time.

45,1d54b73,AITA for telling me gf to not hangout with the guy who ended my last relationship?,"1(20M) have been with my gf (19F) for a few months now and am very happy. Long before going out with my gf I dated a girl who l had met my freshman year of college Jessie. (All fake names of course) We had been dating for about 7 months when I got a text from one of my friends insisting that I look at my best friend of 5 years Jacob’s instagram. I look at the post Jacob made and am horrified to see the post of him announcing his relationship with my girlfriend Jessie with a picture of her practically on top of him and kissing. I immediately message Jessie demanding an explanation. A text appears from Jacob explaining that they had been going out behind my back for weeks now and that he's sorry it worked out this way and that I should just step back and let them be happy. I went off on both of them about how they could betray me like that but I was quickly blocked by both of them. Their perfect relationship only lasted about another month when Jacob cheated on Jessie which wasn't a surprise to me at all, as Jacob is a notorious player.

My current GF knows about everything that happened in my past relationship and seemed very understanding of my trust issues caused by this. Important part of this story is that my  GF is a tutor to others in her free time, a while ago she invited me along as we hadn't been able to spend a lot of time together. We head to the meeting spot of her and the people she's tutoring, and who do I see there? None other than Jacob. For context Jacob and I haven't talked since the incident despite having the same friend group and unfortunately most of our friends took his side in the situation telling me that I can't control who falls in love and I should be happy for them.

After a very awkward tutoring session I tried to very subtly bring up the fact that l was uncomfortable with Jacob being there. Explaining that it made me angry that everyone expected us to hangout like nothing happened.My GF completely brushed me off saying that it was just tutoring, it wasn't a big deal and he had never done anything to her to make her dislike him. I moved on not wanting to make a big deal about it. After all she can hang out with whoever she wants, she's her own person who can make her own decisions.

Since I told my GF and friends I don't like hanging out with Jacob they remedied this by no longer inviting me to events if Jacob will be there. Which is exactly what I asked for I know but it still doesn't feel great to see endless posts of all of our friends including my GF going out and having fun without me. It was no longer just tutoring Jacob and my GF were now hanging out outside of classes and very often.

I feel a bit guilty about it but my GF constantly hanging out with the guy that my ex gf left me for hurts a bit more than I would like to admit

His package includes 20 hours of in class lessons and 10 hours of in car lessons. Thing is 10 hours is no where near enough time to be able to pass the driver’s test, most people get the 20 hour package + few hours of mock test to pass first try. 

My friend told me he doesn’t want to pay the extra $500 to get the 20 hour package and asked if he could borrow my car to practice. I said hell no. First of all in my province a G1 (learning permit) driver isn’t allowed to drive with a G2 (2nd level) licensed driver.

He always criticizes my driving. Not for breaking road rules or not being courteous. But for refusing to break road rules and refusing to be aggressive.

48,1d53lbi,AITA for telling my husband he's too broke to be so sexist?,"Throwaway. 

So my husband comes from a 'traditional' family. Mum's a SAHM, father was sole provider. I come from the opposite - my mother pretty much forbade from ever being financially dependent on a man and drilled that into me early on. 

My husband worked hard to unlearn the values he saw replicated at home. He (often more than) pulled his weight at home, was an engaged and present father and a genuine partner. The one thing that grinds my gears is how much weight he puts on the opinions of his family. I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much.

My ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works. 

My ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home. When I am a guest in their home, I accommodate their ways and play the DIL they wish I was. They have for the most part respected this. 

I got home yesterday after work tired and starving. I typically get home 1815/30 and we eat at 1900. I said quick hellos and ran up for a pre-dinner shower. When I came down, I went to the kitchen to help set up for dinner and found nothing ready. I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat. My husband and his parents served themselves and joined us. 

My MIL was still going on about what was wrong with me and why I was a failure. I asked my husband if he had anything to say. He said his mother had a point and it wouldn't hurt if I acted 'more like a proper woman' and 'took better care of my home and children'. He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me. AITA.

He said his mother had a point and it wouldn't hurt if I acted 'more like a proper woman' and 'took better care of my home and children'. He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised. 

This is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me. AITA.

I said that anytime I say any thing I get lectured and/or cut off and I never do the same to any off them. I then said that I just wished that they would at least have the courtesy to listen to what I had to say instead of cutting me off.  
They did not like that.

My Mom is the only one who understood the rest just said I had to much of an ego ,that I was over reacting or that I'm making stuff up.

53,1d536yn,AITA For telling my wife her family needs to get a hotel next time they visit because of their kids,"My wife (36f) and I (35M) have been married for 7 years and have a 5-year-old son.  My wife has 4 siblings, 2 brothers and 2 sisters.  Her brothers live far away and she isn't very close to them.  Both her sisters live within 2 hours of us and the three of them are very close.  Both of her sisters have 2 kids.  

Her youngest sister, Jen (25F), has a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old.  Jen, her husband, and their kids came to visit us this past weekend for Memorial Day.  We have 3 bedrooms in our house.  Our master, our son's room, and a smaller guest room.  My wife decided on her own that we would let Jen and her family have our bedroom.  

Apparently, Jen's kids aren't the best sleepers at home and if they are in an unfamiliar place, it's even worse.  So, my wife offered Jen our room so all of them can be in one room and my wife and I would sleep in the guest room.  

Turns out, that by ""bad sleepers,"" Jen meant that her kids wake up multiple times a night and then wake up for good at 5am every single day.  I don't know about anyone else, but the last thing I want to do on a weekend is be woken up by a screaming baby at 5am 3 days in a row.  It wasn't just the crying baby, but the fact that Jen and her husband would also be running around getting whatever the baby needed.  

The commotion woke our son up, who then woke my wife and I up.  Every day at 5am.  I spent the entire weekend tired and cranky.  To make things worse, Jen and her husband would take naps together whenever one of their kids was napping.  Which left my wife and I to watch their non-napping kid.  

I complained to my wife about being tired and she told me that her sister and BIL need the rest more than we do because this is their life everyday so we should help them get at least a little bit of a break.  But by the time Jen and her family left on Monday, all I wanted to do was sleep.  Which I did, immediately after they left.  

My wife got upset with me for napping because our son was also tired and cranky and was fighting her on everything.  She woke me up so that she could take a break.  I later told her that next time her sister wants to come visit, they need to get a hotel because their kids sleeping habits are clearly disruptive to our entire family.  

She told me that she isn't going to tell her sister to fork out hundreds for a hotel room when we have the space for them in our house.  She also said that Jen's kids will become better sleepers as they get older.

I told her that every decision she is making prioritizes her sister over me and our son and she got defensive and told me I'm being a jerk.  Maybe I'm far enough removed from the baby stage that I've blocked it out, but I don't remember ever being so disruptive to anyone when we were guests in their house.

54,1d535rj,AITA for going to a strip club at a bachelor party,"Throwaway

This month my friends and I (32M) went on a bachelor party to Portland.  We got a VRBO and the plan was to hike, bar hop, and party for 3 days. The groom to be met his bride to be a little over a year ago.  They only dated for 6 months before they got engaged.  I'm his best man and planned the trip.  The wedding is in 2 weeks.  I am also single which is a key part of this.    
  
The bachelor party was the first time we'd seen him in 2 months as a group.  The first night before we went out, he gets up and asks that we don't go to strip clubs and do drugs.  Including weed.  This led to some curious looks and questions of why.  He said its a request that his fiancé made.  He said she originally didn't want us to drink, but the no strip clubs and drugs was the compromise.  We were already on the trip and just went with it.  We ended up staying in that night as the groom went to bed at 10 citing it was a travel day.    
  
The 2nd day we went out for a hike, went back for naps, then rallied for dinner and drinks.  After a few bars, the groom tried to get everyone back to the house.  Almost no one was ready.  One other friend went back to the groom.  Seemed clear he wasn't supposed to be out late, but that was just us speculating.  That night after the groom and a few others left, we met a bachelorette party, I hit it off with one of them.  They suggested a strip club, so we went to a strip club.  I'm single, had a drink, hung out with that girl, after she left I got a dance and  then went back to the house.  My actions, IMO, were hurting no one.    
  
The next morning the groom was pissed, apparently the Fiancé blew up on him.  Someone sent a snap out of a strip club (one we didn't go to), she saw it and called him last night.  We got in an argument about his Fiancé, I said she is controlling the trip.  He said we aren't expecting her wishes.  I said i'm single, I want to hang out and meet women.  I was called the asshole. The rest of the trip was fine, but not really fun.  With 2 weeks to go he has removed me as the best man at the behest of the fiancé.

56,1d531d1,AITA for exposing a crush that I didn’t even realize existed?,"I (24F) recently started hanging out with this friend group. Everyone is really nice and funny, I absolutely adore literally every single person and I feel like I fit in well. I admit I have a mild crush on one of the guys who we will call C (24M), he’s well liked and I felt like I clicked with him. He was a scrawny nerd growing up and now he’s tall, thick, and handsome, but still has that like nerd energy. Like the man does not realize he is *fine*. Being the person I am, I asked him out, he declined and as a grown adult I moved on. One of his closer friends in the group (25M) mentioned in passing that C has been down bad for someone else for like 4 years to the point where he literally doesn’t interact with other women sexually or romantically at all. I figure I’m infatuated and I’ll be over it in a few months anyway, nbd, not my business.

Last weekend we were all celebrating an amazing, beautiful girl D’s (24F) birthday. It was really fun, chill, we were playing games and listening to music, nbd. C got D legos which was silly but sweet. From my understanding they’re both a bit socially awkward and find solace in little tedious activities like that, so it was sweet and fitting.

Later, D took a sip from her drink and like flinched. She had gotten her septum pierced a few days before and the can touching it felt weird. We all laughed and someone suggested she touch it against someone else’s septum. The only one there with a septum was C, and he IMMEDIATELY got all like blushy and giggly about it. D was down but C was stalling, and finally she like pulled her lips in to not kiss him and bumped her nose ring against his. To everyone’s disappointment, neither of them felt any like shock or anything, but C was a mess.

Now where I might be the asshole. I said, “Oh, D is the one you’re down bad for!” Like a lightbulb went on. Everyone sort of looked at me and C pretty much turned white. D looked confused but before much could happen C’s best friend started redirecting and everything went on like normal. I apologized privately to my friend who brought me into this group because there was a brief awkward moment that was my fault. C and D ended up in the kitchen building legos together anyway so I figured no harm done.

I noticed since then pretty much everyone in the group has been silent. The friend who brought me in said everyone felt like I overstepped. Everyone knew that C was a simp for D and has been for years, and sort of just let things go because they’re both so awkward, it’ll happen when and if it happens. I defended myself and pointed out that another friend referred to C as D’s lapdog who always followed her around, but my friend said that was different. Both D and C expressed mild discomfort, but their best friends are the ones that are really upset with me.

I defended myself and pointed out that another friend referred to C as D’s lapdog who always followed her around, but my friend said that was different. Both D and C expressed mild discomfort, but their best friends are the ones that are really upset with me.

I’d like to make it right, but part of me feels I’m being treated unfairly for something I didn’t realize. AITA?",1.0,1.058879017829895,1,1
57,1d52yc7,AITA for upsetting my MIL and yelling at my husband over how I'm tending to my foster daughter,"I (37F) and my husband (39M) have been fostering our 6-month-old foster daughter for almost three months now. When she first came to us, her parents had been arrested for drug charges and neglect, and they are now facing a prison sentence. With no other family available to care for her, we took her in.  
  
When she arrived at 3 1/2 months old, she was severely malnourished and neglected both physically and emotionally. I've cared for newborns born addicted to drugs who were more settled than she was. It was suspected that she had been left to cry for hours on end, with no one tending to her.  
  
Fast forward to today: she has gained sufficient weight, is starting to show an interest in solid food, and is catching up with her milestones. However, her emotional and social development remains a concern. She rarely smiles, is hard to calm down, and needs to be held and comforted constantly. She is not babbling or cooing like some babies do and won't sleep on her own, needing to be rocked to sleep. Sometimes, she wakes up 3-4 times a night and won't settle on her own.  
  
My MIL came over while I was holding the baby in a carrier while doing some house cleaning. The baby was getting cranky, so I took her into the nursery to rock her to sleep for a nap. It took about 45 minutes. When I came out, my MIL said I should just leave her in the crib to cry it out; otherwise, she'll never settle. I told her that wasn't an option. About 45 minutes later, the baby woke up. So, I took her into the living room and sat on the floor to play with her. My MIL suggested I should just get a playpen and let her learn to entertain herself. I again said that she gets upset to the point of being inconsolable if left alone for more than a minute or two.  
  
Fast forward a few days later, we went over to my MIL's house for brunch. The social worker believes we have a good chance of legally adopting the baby. When we discussed this, my MIL told my husband that we better stop coddling the baby so much, otherwise we'll have a spoiled child on our hands. Annoyed, I told her that I wasn't going to let a baby cry it out, especially one we are trying to form a positive bond with. My MIL was miffed but said nothing.  
  
Later that night, my husband said his mom made a good point. I yelled, feeling bad because it unsettled the baby and took a while to calm her down. I asked him how he would feel if he was locked in a room for hours with no food, no water, and no one tending to his needs, and no matter how much he begged and cried, he was ignored. I told him that the developmental pediatrician said she is making progress with forming a bond and learning to trust again, and that we need to keep being patient. He apologized for upsetting me, but now I feel like I might have overreacted by yelling at him when he was just trying to discuss it with me.   
  
I just want what is best for our foster daughter, regardless of whether she returns to her family, goes to a new family, or stays with ours.

58,1d52oc4,AITA because my bf won’t give me room in bed?,"So I won’t get into a lot of backstory. My (23F) bf (21M) and I, have been together for three years and he has always been really clingy. From following me around the house wherever I go to smothering me with kisses and hugs. I was always flattered by this until it started affecting me.

I started resenting him and telling him to give me space more often. I was telling him not to kiss me and that I just wanted to be alone. Whenever he hugs me, he pust a ton of pressure on my back. He expects me to kiss him for a long period of time anytime we hug and he isn’t aware when I pull away for air, he just forces his face back onto mine because he wants to keep kissing. I didn’t make this a big deal until he started smothering me in bed.

Whenever we get in bed to go to sleep, he puts his leg onto my abdomen and his arm across my chest. For reference, I am extremely small, smaller than average, and while my bf isn’t huge, he definitely is much bigger than me. His legs are also the heaviest parts of his body as he has huge calves and feet. Not only does he put his weight on me but through the night he gets closer and closer causing me to get to the edge of the bed, or be smashed against the wall if I decide to sleep on the other side. I also overheat.

I’ve noticed these things affecting my back as my back has been hurting from being bent uncomfortably throughout the night as well as my abdominal area often sore. Last night I drank a ton of water before bed and woke up in the middle of the night having to pee really bad. I had to pry him off of me and almost peed the bed because it was so difficult and his weight was pressing down on my bladder he readjusted his hold on me while he was half asleep. 

I have always dreamed of someone being obsessed with me and treating me like they don’t want to lose me but I suppose my dream has backfired. Sometimes I will have resentment about something and then use that resentment as an excuse to sleep on the opposite edge of the bed. I would allow us to go to bed mad at eachother and act like I don’t want to be touched so he could leave me alone. I had a talk with him about all of this and his response was: “How does my own girlfriend not want to cuddle with me at night? That’s so weird. If you were in love with me you would crave being close to me”. He took me not wanting to he touched so much as rejection.
He has childhood abandonment trauma and I have childhood trauma from being touched unconsensually. 

AITA for not wanting to be touched so much? 

TLDR; My boyfriend puts all of his weight on me at night and smothers me with hugs/kisses on a daily basis to the point of my own physical suffering. He thinks it’s weird that I don’t crave his touch.

59,1d52kxw,AITA for ordering from a kids menu while being invited out to celebrate my BIL birthday?,"Throwaway as I don't want my main to be tracked. 

I (29f) have been invited to celebrate my BIL birthday to a sushi restaurant alongside with my partner. The birthday dinner was last weekend and there was no way for me to decline or avoid it.

Now I am intolerant to fish and seafood, so I am trying to avoid eating anything containing those and as you can imagine it is rather hard to avoid at a sushi restaurant. The restaurant has other options like chicken katsu curry and different chicken dishes, but they are all a part of kids menu, normal adult menu only had different types of sushi.

So I ordered from the kids menu and also said I am cool paying an adult price for the dish. The waiter was trying to refuse after a brief explanation behind the reasoning they had no problem in serving me something from the kids menu.

Because of this I had a lot of weird looks, especially from my SIL who later confronted me saying what I did was a bit selfish and assholish since I was invited for sushi and since she was trying to convince her children to eat more adult food (poke bowl) and I have ruined it.

My partner is on my side, however some other family members believe I should have sucked it up and ate the sushi.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-31,"AITA for ordering from a kids menu while being invited out to celebrate my BIL birthday? Throwaway as I don't want my main to be tracked.

So I started drinking at 12 but let me make it clear this was like absolutely nothing. I was basically sipping on mouthwash until they arrived. 

And I explained this to my mother who still remained extremely mad because apparently I knew this would make her unhappy because her mother is an alcoholic and this would “trigger” (she’s picked up therapy language from TikTok you should see how much she throws around gaslight) her and I didn’t care etc. Apparently if I started at 2-3 she’d be perfectly content tho. 

I had no idea she would feel that way as she never expressed that before. Which I brought up and I was told I should’ve been more thoughtful.

I was in an on and off relationship when I met sam, he was breaking up with his gf when we met. Although we were not vibing right away, we warmed up to each other and became good friends. There was some tension and chemistry there but we got over it, when me and my bf actually mended the relationship and got engaged. I told my bf about sam and although he was not happy he understood and didn't say anything about us staying friends.
         While sam and his gf broke up and after a month he started dating one of my ex-friends, I was not thrilled but didn't say anything either. Later on he started flirting with me but I was mending my relationship with my bf so didn't encourage it and talked to him about boundaries, he understood and we stayed friends. Now a few days ago I came to know that Sam's now gf is talking shit about me to her friends when I noticed them being hostile towards me, I told sam and he was pretty upset and confronted his gf. They talked and after that he told me he's choosing peace over what's right and that his gf didn't like our friendship given the history and he wouldn't be calling me again and if I need anything I can call him. 
       I got very upset and felt like he's abandoning me to save himself and his gf, and decided to focus on me and my relationship and didn't see him or contact him for over a month.

62,1d52gi4,AITA for “ditching” my family’s name?,"I (M) have never quite understood why it is customary in marriage for the woman to always take the man's last name. My last name is very boring and common, and it isn't one that I feel particularly attached to.

I recently proposed to my wonder fiancé (F) who has a much cooler, more unique, and better sounding last name. We live in one of the few states that legally allows a man to change his last name in marriage, so I decided I would be ditching mine. When I told my fiancé she laughed and seemed genuinely happy about the idea since we both had always agreed her name is far superior.

When we brought up the idea to my parents they were NOT on board much to our surprise. My parents are in no means traditional people but this case they felt very strongly against our choice. My dad said I was ""abandoning"" and ""betraying"" our family name, to which I told him he's blowing things far out of proportion which my mom said was an asshole move and that I should try to see where they're coming from.

For context, I should add a few things. My parents are both only children, and I have no brothers. My sisters are all married and took their husbands' last names, so me taking my fiancé's would effectively kill our last name off. That is a very disturbing idea to my dad, but I feel is not that big of a deal. I am beginning to think I should just keep my name to avoid further familial conflict, but my fiancé seems really excited about the idea. So, AITA?

He had no problem with losing the name on his daughters, but he does with me.

63,1d52gbe,WIBTA if we uninvited our dad from the family party?,"Some important background info: Our father was engaged to another woman (let’s call her Deana) when he met, started dating, and proposed to our mom. Important note: Our mom did not know about Deana until they had started wedding planning and he had broken things off with Deana. Our parents got married and had three daughters. They divorced due to our father’s drinking in about 2000, and towards the end of the marriage he had an affair with Deana (the exact timeline is unclear). He continued to date Deana on and off, none of the three of us cared for her due to the affair and her being generally rude, especially towards our mom. Our father then dated a young woman and they had our half-brother (let’s call him Jesse). Our father was in and out of jail throughout the next several years. He eventually went to prison for some pretty horrendous stuff in 2017/2018, and one of my older sisters (let’s call her Belle) took full custody of Jesse. Belle lives with our mom and step-dad, so they all three took care of Jesse. Last year, our father got out of prison, and we recently found out he is in a “complicated relationship” with Deana. When she found out, Belle made it explicitly clear that we do not like Deana, and we don’t want to discuss her with him, ever.

The good stuff: All four of us have very strained relationships with our father (due to the many issues mentioned above, plus some). All of us have been low to no contact with him since he got out of prison last year. Our little brother Jesse is graduating high school in a few weeks (all thanks to Belle, our mom, and step-dad). Our father told Belle that he intends to bring Deana to the graduation ceremony. After discussing with us, Belle told our father that none of us, especially Jesse, are comfortable with Deana coming to graduation, and that we all agree it should just be close family (this is all true, and she even left out some of the more angry things Jesse said). Our father then said that he will not be uninviting Deana from graduation as that would be rude, so Belle told him that if Deana comes, they cannot sit with us. He did not back down.

Just two days ago we sent out an invite to Jesse’s graduation party which is being hosted by Belle at our mom and step-dad’s house. Our father RSVP’d for two people, which we assume includes Deana. Obviously, all four of us kids, along with our step-dad, are incredibly upset by this.

Are we the assholes if we tell our father if he insists on bringing Deana, he is uninvited to our brother’s party?

Some additional info: When Belle took custody of Jesse, he had transferred schools about 7 times and was about to be taken to court for truancy.

64,1d52ed1,AITA for trying to set boundaries for myself?,"Bit of background: My partner and I have been together for almost 10 years. I have been dealing with his family and their undertone comments. They are white and I am not. My FIL's favorite line during our relationship is ""her favorite meal is fried chicken and watermelon so we need to make sure we have that at every party."" I am deeply in love with him so every comment that was made or stated I let it go. I have thick skin so I could hand most comments. I was always told by everyone that who he is and to pretty much ignore him, which I have done.  
  
We both 2 wonderful children 4 and 1. We had moved back into my in laws house because of horrible living conditions. I found out shortly before we moved in that I was pregnant with our youngest. I asked my partner to keep in quiet for a while due to being EXTREMELY high risk after our first coming at 23 weeks pregnant (a normal pregnancy last 40 weeks).  
  
Well they didn't keep in a secret. My in laws got told within the first week of us living with them. I was very upset with him for telling but I moved past it. Due to being high risk I was put on a mild bedrest at 19 weeks, I couldn't keep anything down, I had to go see a specialist 75mins away from home every week, and I also couldn't be around my first for more than 20-30mins (I got dizzy standing/sitting up for too long). Again comments were made how I should get my tubes tied or how lazy I was because I wasn't doing much for my child. I ended up being admitted to the hospital until the baby was born. We moved out shortly after having him, I became distance with a lot of his family. I was berated for doing so, I never once not let the boys go over to see their family, I just choose to not go over. I had a really bad mental breakdown and got postpartum. I wasn't helping out much with the new baby and I could barely leave my bedroom.  
  
After this we decided to move back into my in laws to save money and have round the clock care for the kids that I might not have been able to provide at all times. Well I have put up boundaries this time around, but unfortunately sometimes a couple comments are still being made either to me or behind my back. I want to go low contact for myself and myself only. Both boys are more than happy to see the in laws or go to family functions, as well as my husband. As for myself I would like to just make appearances when it is healthy for me. 

I am in therapy a couple times a week. My husband also works out of the home and is gone from Sunday night to Friday afternoon, so he doesn't see much while he is here. Which means it's only the boys and myself staying. No one takes anything out on the kids so that is why I am completely comfortable sending them with their father for events. I have been trying to get back to being the best mother I can be for the boys. I do understand my in laws are helping with the youngest when I am having an attack and can't care. But I would really like to set a boundary for myself.

65,1d52cna,AITA for cursing at a rude passenger?,"Hi, this just happened earlier so excuse me if this entire thing isn’t constructed in a clear way. 

Earlier, my mother (45F) and I (16F) got on a jeep (in the Philippines), and sat down on a seat near the driver. After a while, the jeep took in 3 passengers whom I’ll name A, B, C. Since the seats were nearly fully occupied, A, a 30-something-year old mom, asked for me to move so her daughter, C, gets to seat properly. Now, I just smiled and moved, because you know, I was being considerate. Also jeepneys tend to be really packed. But from the very start, A was saying it in such a snobby way, like her daughter was entitled to that seat.

When we were handing our payment to the driver, B, a 30-something-year old mom and a friend of A, spoke in Kapampangan, a dialect mostly spoken in the province we were at. They were laughing hysterically, and said shit about how “we smelled like the perfumes Arabs use”, “how cheap we were”, “look at those plastic bags, must have shopped in a tiangge (market)” in said dialect. I guess they assumed we couldn’t understand because we didn’t say shit when they were talking about us, in our faces. Oh, but we were natives too and understood everything they said.

They really kept on going about it about how we apparently “smelled”, and even had the nerve to point at us, several times. Like actual pointing and laughing. The entire 25 minute ride. They were just laughing and gossiping, purely on how it bothers them. I even looked at A’s daughter, B, and I was so sure my eyes were sending out signs like “um, maybe do something about your rude mom?” One passenger, around my age, even told me “tangina, akala mo naman kung sino” (son of a bitch, who do they think they are?) I just found myself agreeing with him.

Before we got out I just blurted out the words “ignorant fucking bitch”. Not sure they heard it, but I think they did, they looked stunned. 

The thing is, we were dressed, and was about to go to a family gathering hence the plastic bags that contained food. I don’t know what would warrant such treatment from them. They were acting like your average elite school moms who just looked down on everyone else (and they actually were both of those things). Even said we ruined the experience. If you wanted to be treated like a queen so bad, why didn’t you just drive in your goddamn fucking car and not get in a public utility vehicle?

Look, I know there’s instances that some people don’t notice they smell. Especially after a long day. But the thing is, the jeep we rode on was a street away from our home and it was a windy day so I don’t think we sweated much. We had perfume mists on (BBW Warm Vanilla Sugar).

The entire day, some people were complimenting me and asking what perfume I wore. It did make me self-conscious for the entire day, I must admit.

The wedding is in the town we grew up in, so my boyfriend and I would have to take time off work, arrange flights, a hotel, transportation, and a dog sitter. He has known about the wedding for a while and it is now just over 4 months away. He is now refusing to go when he had previously said he'll think about it. He works remotely but is in a high up position and states taking time off work would be extremely difficult, not to mention losing money and the cost of the trip. He also says he doesn't feel like he should have to go as the wedding doesn't have anything to do with him as he does not know my friend or her fiance. 

She and I have been best friends for 20 years and I am the maid of honor, so her wedding is very important to me. Because we live in different states, she and my boyfriend have not spent any time together. I would like for them to at least meet once as they are the two most important people to me, and what better day than her wedding? My boyfriend and I are also from different cultures so it would be nice for him to have more exposure to my own culture, as my friend is having culturally traditional wedding. 

I got upset and started yelling at him for refusing to go when he knows how much it would mean to me. He said I was being shitty for pushing him to go as he would be extremely uncomfortable there. He does not enjoy being in crowds around people or anything that would draw attention to himself, and he could be alone most of the wedding as I would be handling maid of honor duties.

I especially love a lot of Korean food, so I decided I'd make a Korean meal spread with a wide variety of banchans.

He saw my big spread of dishes and said eww that looks gross. I told him he should at least try some of it because I think he'd like several of the things I made.

69,1d50v2b,AITA for avoiding/being mad at my In-laws?,"
Me and my husband (27F/M) have been trying to get pregnant for 1.5 years. We went to the doctor to see if something was wrong. Long story short: I can get pregnant, but cause my DNA is melted together, I have a high risk of having miscarriages or conceiving a child with a disorder. Earlier this year I got pregnant. 
We were scared that the pregnancy might go wrong.  We waited (8 weeks) to tell our families the good news. We explicitly told them to keep the news to themselves, because we were not 100% sure if everything was ok. My MIL told her sister that I am pregnant. The aunt messaged me directly to congratulate me.
A week after that, we were going to have dinner at my MIL's. My husband’s niece showed up before we arrived. Apparently, my MIL had told her that I am pregnant. I heard about the slip-up from my SIL. Both times, we were angry at her for not respecting our wishes because it is a stressful period for us. We still didn’t know if the baby was ok this early in the pregnancy.

After the 13weeks, we were ready to tell our friends. So I met up with a friend of mine for lunch to tell her the news. But she told me that my MIL had told her mother that I was pregnant.

At this point, I was fed up because it was the third time she slipped up. My close friends were planning the baby shower. We plan showers for each other, so that’s not a surprise. I only commented on my wishes in general, and the rest was up to them. I didn’t want to know the location or date. But my MIL told me.

My SIL is also pregnant. When she expressed the wish not to tell anyone about her pregnancy, my MIL did not tell a soul. When my husband and I expressed such wishes, they were ignored. My SIL gave birth a couple of days ago, and my due date is 08.08. My inlaws are planning to go on vacation for 4 weeks after my baby shower (June 29th). There is a chance that they might miss the birth of our baby. 
I have a feeling that they show more love towards their other grandchildren and that they respect their daughter more than my husband. My husband has never expressed that he is sad or disappointed in any way. When I bring it up, he says, “They are grown-ups, I cannot force them to stay or postpone their vacation.” He asked them to postpone their vacation by a couple of weeks so that they wouldn’t miss the birth our baby. But they said they already planned the trip and didn’t want to go later. They also said they would be back before my due date.
My parents will not go on vacation and declined a wedding invitation so that they would not miss the birth of our baby. My parents also said that they want to help us by cleaning the house, cooking etc. We really appreciate that.

I now avoid going to my in-laws because they are clearly busy with their grandchildren and planning a vacation. I don’t care anymore, but I don’t want my child to feel left out in the future.

70,1d50t0d,WIBTA if I asked one of my parents to miss my sister's graduation so they could see mine finish?,"I (17F) and my sister (15F) are graduating in a couple of weeks, im finishing highschool and my sister is finishing secondary school, and it just so happens to be on the same day. Due to the pandemic, my sister has never had a graduation before, since her primary school one was done virtually through a video call, and I myself had both my primary school (which honestly i don't remember at all) and secondary school graduations done as normal. Furthermore, we have studied in different schools due to me hoping schools to escape bullying, and the school I had my secondary graduation at just happened to give a much bigger emphasis and celebration to this events than my sister did. 

This school year has been actual hell for me, as I started off failing four due to my mental health, but have improved with help of school counselling and my phycologist. I still have to face the college entry exams, and tie a few loose ends regarding a couple of classes I'm still failing, but I'm essentially all done for moving out for college for good. So this is kind of a big dead for me, since I kind of never expected to actually make it to this day.

The arrangement was going to be that one parent would go to each graduation, but a delay has occured on my sister's one part and it will be celebrated later. So my parents are suggesting both going to the start of my graduation, and as soon as I get my diploma, run off to my sister's. 

This sounds like the option that makes the most sense, but it's bugging me out a bit. I'm worried they might not even get to see me graduate, since my highschool is way bigger than my sister's school, so my ceremony will be much longer. Furthermore, we also have other activities such as us doing little dances, speeches and such. But there is about six classes, we are more than a 100 students, so it's possible that, by the time they have to head off to my sister's, I might not even have my diploma.

I'm also kind of worried about what will happen after the ceremony, because it's a big thing and everyone will be just kissing and hugging their parents and I'll be kind of just standing there. And honestly I think that would feel kind of bad. 

Would I be the asshole just one of my parents to come, but stay for the whole thing? I obviously don't want my sister to not have her parents on her graduation, but I kind of feel like mine is a bit more important, because I will be leaving home after all in a couple months. I feel disgusting for thinking this way but it just... I mean I'm leaving! I want to celebrate with my parents too. I'm ok with one of them missing it, but to finish the whole thing and being all alone... I don't know.

I still have to face the college entry exams, and tie a few loose ends regarding a couple of classes I'm still failing, but I'm essentially all done for moving out for college for good. So this is kind of a big dead for me, since I kind of never expected to actually make it to this day.

The arrangement was going to be that one parent would go to each graduation, but a delay has occured on my sister's one part and it will be celebrated later. So my parents are suggesting both going to the start of my graduation, and as soon as I get my diploma, run off to my sister's. 

This sounds like the option that makes the most sense, but it's bugging me out a bit. I'm worried they might not even get to see me graduate, since my highschool is way bigger than my sister's school, so my ceremony will be much longer. Furthermore, we also have other activities such as us doing little dances, speeches and such. But there is about six classes, we are more than a 100 students, so it's possible that, by the time they have to head off to my sister's, I might not even have my diploma.

I'm also kind of worried about what will happen after the ceremony, because it's a big thing and everyone will be just kissing and hugging their parents and I'll be kind of just standing there. And honestly I think that would feel kind of bad. 

Would I be the asshole just one of my parents to come, but stay for the whole thing? I obviously don't want my sister to not have her parents on her graduation, but I kind of feel like mine is a bit more important, because I will be leaving home after all in a couple months. I feel disgusting for thinking this way but it just... I mean I'm leaving! I want to celebrate with my parents too. I'm ok with one of them missing it, but to finish the whole thing and being all alone... I don't know.

Sorry for any typos, I'm spanish and struggle with the language and please, I donr want no subway surfers kinda short read this in a video because I really don't want them to know I'm asking this.",4.0,1.05645751953125,1,0

We had a campaign with my family and my brother’s girlfriend for a while, but my brother moved out of town and video calls were few and far between and that just kinda lost its fire. I tried to get a couple I am friends with into it also but they were also far away and it never got off the ground.

Finally my boyfriend told me about a group of friends at work who were super into the idea and he was going to dm the homebrew we had started with my family.

The catch is, I’m not allowed to play. He is standing on a hill of he wants to do it with just his guy friends, no girls allowed kind of situation.

He just keeps throwing it in my face that I’m being toxic and I need to let him have guy time and I’m just jealous he won’t be spending time with me. At this point I don’t even wanna spend time with him, I just want to play DnD.

73,1d50k1i,AITA for letting my brother’s gf “escape”? ,"Throwaway due to my brother knowing my account

My brother and his gf have lived in my apartment for 4 years. I use to live there (bought it 7 years ago) but when I married my wife, we bought another place and I decided to keep the apartment as a rental. 

There’s some issues with their relationship and it may be ending as she found another job in another state. They have together for 6 years and she wants to get married but my brother is hesitating on proposing. He says she’s the one but won’t propose. Her industry isn’t big in our state so she has always been underpaid and recently she accepted a job in another state which from my understanding is a huge salary bump. He is very unhappy about this and thinks she is blindsiding him and she thinks she shouldn’t put their relationship over her career because he refuses to propose. 

She wants me to end the lease. Which I’ve written means she needs to give me 3 months notice and they signed the lease knowing this. She has given me 3 weeks notice. My brother wants me to enforce it and fight with her to get the 3 months notice. She agreed to leave her half the security deposit and I’m just cancelling lease. He is pissed because he thinks I’m on her side because I’m letting her off east. In reality I haven’t increased rent for 4 years for them and her leaving means he will probably leave soon too as he can’t afford rent alone and I can increase rent. Also I don’t want to fight with her in case they actually make a mends and she ends up my SIL. Unlikely now but still.

75,1d50ddq,AITA for refusing to let my sister tell my dad his bday gift I bought is from her?,"Throwaway account

Little backstory, my sister (27f) and I (24m) used to live together, but she moved her boyfriend (28m) in. I got a good paying job in that time frame, so I decided to get my own place so that those two can have their space.

Around 3-4 months ago, my sister's boyfriend got layed off from a company office job he's had for a while. Since then, though, he's refused to even apply for a new job, whether it's due to pride, depression, or just downright laziness. But he's been living off my sister now, and as much as I and my family tell her he's a grown man who shouldn't get to live off her forever, she won't do anything to change the situation and has been paying all the bills. 

There's not really much I can do there if my sister doesn't want the help. I send her some cash if she's in a tight spot for gas, but I'm not going to pay for my sister's boyfriend to sit on the couch.

Anyway, back to the point. My sister has a lot less money now, since she's paying for two. She complains all the time about not having any money for herself, but it pretty much falls on deaf ears because she won't listen to our advice and poking. My dad's birthday is tomorrow, and he's been really excited about his new hobby of sports card collecting. He's been talking for a while about buying this one complete set of baseball cards, but he's short on cash.

I bought it for him. I'm planning on giving it to him tomorrow at his bday dinner, but my sister somehow found out I bought it for him this morning has since been begging me to say it's from her. ""I don't have any money to get him anything, and I don't want to disappoint him,"" is what she's been saying.

She also suggested that I pay for his dinner bill, and I can say that's my gift to him.

Recently, we were all playing games together until Lily left suddenly and was giving short responses. She came to me to complain and vent about the fact she felt Sarah was making her feel stupid and excluded, to which I tried to make her feel better.

She started telling me all about how I'd never want her, how she's so unaffectionate and is scary in a relationship. This went on for a good while, and it started to become uncomfortable.

About an hour later, Annie texted me to ask if I knew why Lily was so upset. I explained that Sarah made her mad. During this conversation Annie made it clear to me that Lily had feelings for me, which was a complete shock. She asked me how I felt about Lily and during that part of the conversation I explained that Lily made me uncomfortable with just how much shit she was talking about Sarah for next to no reason.

I ended our friendship when i found out she kissed my housemate (31M) and lied to me about how it happened. she originally told me, in tears, he kissed her and kept making moves on her at a small get together; my stomach dropped bc i thought the guy i saw as an older brother was actually just some predator. and she said it only happened once and she told him no more of anything romantic.
The next day i sat my housemate down and asked what happened. he said she kissed him and then kissed him multiple times, then broke down in the car saying they shouldn’t be doing this and wanted boundaries bc she couldn’t trust him after the pain she has been put through. this is where i drew my line as way back when she broke up with my friend, i told her “not my housemate, he’s 10 years older than you” and she broke my trust and so did my house mate, as i asked him to not go for her as it would be weird.

i feel like an idiot trying to tell a 31yo guy what to do, and i’ve cut all contact with the ex-friend as it was a very one sided friendship and it was becoming toxic. but the age gap freaks me out and the fact i told them both to not do anything bc it puts me in a weird position if they were to ever break up and if i stayed friends with them both.

i feel like an idiot trying to tell a 31yo guy what to do, and i’ve cut all contact with the ex-friend as it was a very one sided friendship and it was becoming toxic. but the age gap freaks me out and the fact i told them both to not do anything bc it puts me in a weird position if they were to ever break up and if i stayed friends with them both.
AITA? or am i putting my nose in someone else’s business.

One couple in the group has a child who is going to kindergarten next year. In other words, they found an excuse for a themed party. They extended this invitation to my sister, if she happens to be around.

My sister (I'll call her Mary) doesn't live in our city, but tends to visit during breaks, or when the whim strikes her. She's a self-described ""free spirit."" Sometimes I'll know about her visit in advance, which would be a week at most. Usually she calls as she's on her way. On very rare occasion, she just shows up. It's a little annoying, but I know I could do the same and she would let me in. 

Mary had met my friends and likes them. She also will never say no to a party. My reluctance stems from Mary having a new boyfriend. While I have yet to meet this one, Mary has always dated disasters, in the worst definitions of the word. I do not want to expose to my friends, and definitely not their children. 

If I invite her, she will go out of her way to be here, and bring her +1. I know her feelings will be hurt when she finds out I kept this from her, but I don't want to put my friends and their kids at risk.

We are currently selling the estate we share with this relative & they are claiming their late relation we inherited our half of the property from owed them money.

In addition we also had given them money to get by prior to finding out about the embezzlement & also are paying more than our share of the bills on the property. It's been over a year and the amount we've paid for her to remain on propert until it sells is quite significant. For all these reasons I feel we've been incredibly fair & am refusing to give more than legally required. We've already agreed to split the proceeds in half and now she's coming back demanding more money & playing on the emotions of my spouse.  He's worried if we do not give her additional money now he will feel responsible when she inevitably runs out of cash in a few years. She's incredibly bad with finances & it's a certainty her money will be gone quickly. 

This person also has spread false rumors about us with the rest of the family. She has also knowingly stolen valuable items from the property that legally belong to my spouse & lied about their whereabouts. 

One suggestion I made is to provide her with a portion of the amount she is requesting from us in exchange for a letter admitting to the fraud she committed in an apology letter we can use to clear our names with the rest of the family or choose to make public at our discretion. In addition a return of the goods (at least in part) as well as a record of where she sold items so if anything is still unsold we can make an attempt to buy back.

i recently purchased a very expensive bicycle to use around our homeowners association. due to living in the midwest, this is the first time this year it’s been consistently warm enough to start biking for the year. 2 months ago my parents got mulch delivered, which took them a month and a half to get to, causing a large blockage in our driveway and garage area. due to this, my step dad said we couldn’t use any of our bikes, which made sense at the time and i respected it. however, the mulch has finally been completed and the driveway is now fully accessible. yesterday i asked “is everything alright for me to use my bike again” and i was told no, that nobody would be allowed to use their bikes until my stepdad felt that his garage was cleaned to his satisfaction. now i can promise and assure you, that i am an extremely neat person. my room, bathroom, vehicle, belongings, everything is the cleanest and most organized out of anyone in the home, BY FAR. the only item i have of my own in the garage is this bicycle, which is why i expressed how stupid this “punishment” is. not only am i a 22 year old adult, who pays significant rent, cleans up meticulously after myself, helps out with projects around the house, but i have absolutely nothing to do with the mess in his garage. my contest to this, is them expressing how it’s their home, their rules, and ultimately their garage, and it’s completely rude and ungrateful of me to go against their rules.

82,1d4yrm4,WIBTA for not seeing my parents on Father's day weekend after my moms behavior at my wedding?,"To begin, my parents flew inthe night before the wedding which was on a Friday. My sister and her partner drove. All of them were staying at an AirB&B about 20 minutes away from our AirB&B where I told them to meet in order to get ready. To stay on schedule, the hair and makeup artists were to meet at our place to start on my mother and sister to have time for others who were not going to make it until later in the day and who were in the ceremony. They were half an hour late. Trying to not be a bridezilla, I asked my dad why they were late and he just shrugged his shoulders and told me that they were awake at 4 AM (they usually wake up then to get ready for work).   
While I was getting ready and taking the typical photos of my mom buttoning my dress, my photographer/videographers were trying to get footage and asking my mom to smile. She snapped at them saying something like “Its really fucking hard to button these buttons!”. At that point I was embarrassed and was asking if she wanted my MOH to help her out. The attitude continued which caused me to cry, and I had to get my makeup redone before our first look. We were already running behind.  
Later in the night I go to the bridal suite to change dresses, and I see my sister and her partner packing up their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say they are leaving and that they are tired. I believe that around this time it is about 9:30. I asked if my parents were also leaving and they said “Obviously because they drove us.” At this time a friend starts helping me out of my dress and my mother walks in asking if I want help, but between the alcohol and frustration, I tell her to get out and that we’ve got it. I was upset that they were leaving before our intimate faux exit that was going to be the wedding party and our family. My father later tells me that he wanted to stay but my mom said no.  
The next few days following our wedding I was getting reports from my husband and friends about my moms demeanor and instances of her being rude to them. My dad also tells me about her being rude to him and saying that the top hat he chose for the wedding looked stupid.  
I know that overall these are not huge things and that there are way worse mother of the bride situations out there, but I feel hurt due to her behavior. This is not the first time she has been unable to handle her emotions and lashes out in hard situations(can provide examples). There are other factors to this situation as well, but I am out of characters.Overall, I have been pretty upset since the wedding and haven't talked to my mom besides one phone call where I don’t feel that she was genuine in her apology. My father keeps guilting me every time he calls that I won’t talk to my mom, and I am debating on not seeing them when they come to my city next month.

Nowadays I have a 9 to 5 office job and enjoy playing as one of my hobbies (gaming being the main other) but I'm often tired or not in the mood to play at any given opportunity.

So here's the problem: R was playing 2 or 3 times a week with another singer. 2 x 45 minute sets per gig for about £150 to £200. She has now quit and R doesn't want to do the gigs alone so has asked me to do them with him. I used to be a sound guy so I usually end up setting up the PA and running the desk during the gigs.

I played 4 gigs with him last week and he could only afford to pay me 1/3rd of the total fee which I agreed to as long as he does all the driving. This is bonus money for me so it's not a big deal.

He has now sent me a list of gigs for the next 3 months and asked if I'll play them. I don't want to, but he's laying the guilt on thick about needing the money and appreciating my help etc.

85,1d4yhh6,WIBTA for not sharing my inheritance with my half-brother?,"I (18M) have a half-brother (16M) who I have never met. He is the result of my dad’s affair with another woman when I was a kid. My dad left my mom and me for his mistress and started a new family with her. He never paid any child support or alimony, and he rarely contacted me. He basically abandoned me and chose his new family over me.

  
My mom raised me by herself and worked hard to provide for me. She passed away last year from leukemia and left me everything she had, which was not much, but enough to pay off my student loans and buy a small apartment. I was devastated by her death and I miss her every day.  
A few weeks ago, I got a call from my dad’s mistress, who is now his wife. She told me that my dad had died in a traffic accident and that he had left a will. He left half of his estate to his wife and the other half to his sons, me and my half-brother. However, he also left a note saying that he wanted me to meet his family to get the money and forgive him saying that he regretted not being a good father to me. He asked his lawyer and wife to contact me and make me aware that he had left me a substantial portion of the inheritance.

  
I was shocked and angry when I heard this. I hate him for trying to buy my forgiveness with his money, after ignoring me and my family for most of my life. I told his wife that I didn’t want anything from him and that I wanted nothing to do with them. She sounded hurt and said that they were just trying to honor his wishes and that they wanted to get to know me and be a family. She said that my half-brother was looking forward to meeting me and that he was willing to share ""his"" inheritance with me. She asked me to reconsider and give them a chance.  
I hung up on her and blocked her number. I don’t want to have any contact with them. I don’t care about the money or the family. I only care about my mom, who was the only parent I ever had. She was the one who loved me and supported me, and she was the one who deserved the inheritance, not them. I dont want them to have it either though, it seems as if I am promised around 25% and I would rather have the money go to my youngest sister, but I dont want to take which I see as a bribe. What should I do?

  
I am conflicted, I know I could just suck it up, but it feels like I would be disrespecting my dead mother if I did so, but I really need the money. Meeting them is a requirement to get the money, and I can't just do it once. It said I had to spend time with them and do ""bonding"" activities with them. I have to spend nearly 30hours to be eligible. My younger sister, she could really use the money, and she's the person I care about the most. I also dont want to forgive the man that ruined moms life and indirectly led to her death. I'm sure I could make some money to help her with college/life, but I'm never gonna be able to match the insane sum that he left for me.

For context, my mother has a history of shouting, and getting angry at me and my brother in public places. Screaming in our faces or forcing us out of stores, and then rushing out with us trailing behind her. It’s embarrassing, but neither of us have ever said anything about it out of fear, and also the understanding that she’s just stressed out.

Today at the grocery, we had gone to the meat isle to get something to cook for later. There was a sale on chicken, and my mom was asking if I’d like it or not. But, it smelled awful there. Something was clearly rotting, and the smell was nauseating. It was enough to make me cover my nose, and I only nodded in response before rushing out of the isle to wait for my mom to finish.

She came back out empty handed, and I was confused. By the look on her face I could tell something was wrong, so I tried not to push for an answer. When we got to the checkout lane, i asked why she hadn’t gotten it, and she said it was because I was being “too fucking sour” loud enough for others to hear. I don’t really know why I reacted so strongly, but I started to cry immediately after, and ignoring that we were in public, I confronted her and shouted at her, asking whyshe always did this, and why she couldn’t wait til we were in the car, or anywhere more private. She didn’t give an answer but asked again why I was being “such a hog” and I told her it was because I was nauseous. She said I should’ve just told her and left it at that.

We didn’t speak for hours after getting home. Usually, after something like that, I’m fine the next day. I get over it, and she pretends it never happened, but it’s the next day now and I’m still extremely upset. I feel like I could cry again, and I want to talk to her about it, but I also feel like it’s not really that serious, and I should just get over it like I always do. I also feel bad for getting angry at her like that, I feel that she was right, and I should have just told her I wasn’t feeling good. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-05-31,"AITA for yelling at my mom?

87,1d4ye7g,AITA for yelling at the resident doctor?,"

I (22F) am an international med student in Turkey. I'm currently in my forth year, the year that clinical rotations usually starts. 
So a bit of background info, Turkish in my third language, all 6 years of education were supposed to be conducted in English (excluding patient interaction of course). However, other interntational students and I were surprised that all lessons and everything were switched to Turkish this year without notice.

It was really a big change for me and I had to put twice the effort that Turkish students put in our lessons and had to improve my Turkish as well. It was really hard but i pulled it off and now I'm one of the top students in my class. Clinical rotations are always difficult because everyone has the prejudice that I know nothing because I'm a foreigner so I really have to prove myself. 

I'm currently doing my last clinical rotation of the year (OB/GYN) in a public hospital. I'm currently in a group with 4 other people and each day we have to rotate in three different sections. First day was fine, my friend (also an international student) and I went to delivery room and it was really good. Second day we were supposed to switch with two other girls from our group to go postpartum ward but the resident doctor who works there didnt want us because we are foreigners and ""wouldn't understand her"". 

We kept telling her that we knew Turkish and to give us at least one shot but she refused and insisted on having someone Turk with her. We kept talking to her and she just ignored us like we weren't there, she just kept talking to the Turks and saying that she wants one of them there instead and not acknowledge us at all. I got really upset and basically yelled at her saying that we knew Turkish and she should just let us try but she ignored. I stormed out and went to a different ward and apparently she was being mean to everyone that day. My friend who was with me said I overreacted but honestly I felt i should have done more and filed a complaint against her. My friends told me not to because she could make our lives hell.

88,1d4y6e5,AITA for complaining to leasing office about a roommate,"I (21M) live with 3 other people (2 21Ms) and 1 (25M). We have been living together for close to two years, when one roommate (25M) decided to let his girlfriend and dog move in with us 6 months ago. 

This was not something that was previously discussed, and the only thing I had heard from the roommate was that the girlfriend was coming to stay. I never want to assume peoples situations, so I didn’t say anything to resist and let her move in without issue. 

The bigger issue was the dog moving in with us. To my knowledge, neither me nor the other two roommates were told about this. I am allergic and have had plenty of reactions to his fur even though they attempt to keep him locked in their room. His hair can still be seen on most of the belongings in the living room and kitchen. 

I still (other than communicating my allergies) did not say anything directly about the living situation and attempted to roll with it, but things kept getting worse between the roommates personally over smaller issues.  

We discussed said smaller issues like the air conditioning, and any conversation we had led to him clearly saying that he “doesn’t care what anyone thinks” and “we all pay rent” which in his mind meant he gets to do whatever he wants without compromise. Things got worse in the apartment for all of us, with me not speaking to said roommate for months. 

Finally, after feeling like I was walking on eggshells and not allowed to live a certain way in my apartment, me and the other 2 roommates agreed that he had become too much, and we opted to make the leasing office in our apartment complex aware of the living situation along with my allergies with the dog. The apartment complex gave him 7 days to fix both the guest situation and pet situation (both of which are breaking the leases we agreed to) and his lease will most likely be terminated. 

I feel bad for the points that we did not communicate to him on the bigger issues like having another person live with us, but I did mention multiple times my allergies with the dog. We did not feel as if any compromise or good feeling would come out of it because of how dismissive he was of us both in every day life and over smaller issues like air conditioning use. I’m not happy that the apartment complex only gave him a week to figure this out, because he is an international student, but we did what we thought was best for the apartment.

89,1d4y3by,AITA for smoking weed for the first time?,"I (14M) smoked weed for the first time on a trip visiting Amsterdam with my mum. Me and my mum are originally from Chile but live in Germany (where weed is legal), and smoking weed is incredibly normalised on my mums side of the family. I was allowed to try just a little bit while we were at our Airbnb in the evening, but before doing so I told my boyfriend (15M, Colombian) about it and he reacted very negatively.

(The weed in question wasn't strong at all, and Im pretty sure it was grown outdoors. It was rolled up very thinly, too.)


My birthday was coming up so I thought it'd be a memorable little private thing I could do with my mum, but he said I shouldn't do it and that weed can give you schizophrenia and various other health problems. I smoked a bit anyway (2 very short drags) and didn't even get high, so it's not like it was worth the small fight we had. We didn't speak for approximately 30 hours after that argument and now we're talking to each-other again but he still seems very negative about it. Am I in the wrong here?

EDIT: This got a lot more attention than I expected, but I appreciate the criticism and Ive made up with my boyfriend after communicating properly and talking about our feelings and whatnot. I’m probably gonna wait until Im a bit older to smoke again, but until then I think i’ll just stay away from other drugs or alcohol since I have no interest in them.

90,1d4xtdc,WIBTA if I destroy an old lady's Gazebo?,"I live in a very small town in the mid-west USA. My primary job is working as a farm hand on my Uncle's farm. My side job is being a hired handy man. The current issue I am facing is I got a call to do a little demolition. I went over and he has a gazebo in his backyard that he wants torn down and cleared away. The problem is while we were talking his mothing came out yelling at me to keep my hands off her property.

For simplicity I will call him Sam and his mother Mabel. Mabel is technically the homeowner as the title is in her name but she began to suffer from dementia a little over a year ago and Sam was given power of attorney over her. Sam is allowed to make both financial and medical decisions in her name so legally he is allowed to demo the gazebo.

Legally I am not doing anything wrong. My problem is more of a moral issue. Mabel's late husband built her that gazebo for her as a wedding present when they married back in 1974. Mabel has tea and snacks out there almost daily and is really attached to it. Sam wants it gone because the wood is rotten and is endanger of collapsing. I checked the wood myself and can confirm that it is a hazard but seeing Mabel in tears about it had me feeling bad.

So WIBTA for destroying the gazebo as it is a hazard but breaking an old lady's heart in the process?

INFO: Thanks to everyone for commenting and I will try to answer a bunch of the questions y'all are asking. I do not have the carpentry skills to build or repair a gazebo. The gazebo is, if I had to guess, about 85% rotten. The wood literally sunk in when I stepped on it the first time. Not only does Sam not want to see her get hurt, or worse, on it but he also said that since he knows its dangerous if she gets hurt or worse from it he can get charged with elder abuse/neglect. Sam currently doesn't have enough extra money to buy a new one or hire the town carpenter to build one because he is still waiter for his house in Colorado to sell. After that he is willing to buy a new one but in the meantime this one is dangerous and needs to go. 

INFO 2: just as a heads up it’s raining today and they’re calling for more tomorrow so if I will update Sunday with what I decided. To answer more good questions, I am a fully independent handyman and just take whatever odd jobs I get offered. I am not the best off financially, like I’m not struggling but I’m not far from it either and the pay he is offering for what would be a single afternoon of work is not a small amount. I’ve seen a lot of people ask about churches and local carpenters and this is what I know. Mabel has been attending the same church for the last 30 years but I don’t know if Sam has reached out to them and I don’t wanna reach out myself and get involved in other folks business. The only carpenters I know in the area is a father son team that runs a furniture business. I’ve worked with the father recently so I might call him and ask if anything can be done.

93,1d4x7c8,AITA for telling my friend she works too much,"My best friend started a new job three months ago and she consistently works 12-14 hour days, sometimes weekends. She always talks about how tired, miserable, and stressed she is, and her life right now is only work and sleep. She's so tired that on weekends when she doesn't work, she just sleeps the entire time and barely sees anyone or leaves the house. She cancels plans on everyone because she is always so tired. She will mentally spiral when over-stressed. I consider her to be a full-on workaholic. 

We never hang out anymore. I went from seeing her every other weekend, to seeing her maybe twice period since she started. Her partner, myself, and other loved ones have confronted her about her workaholic tendencies, and she doubles down saying that she started a new career and we need to lay off. 

Even before this, at her old job, she would work herself to death there too. I saw her more back then since it was a job she worked 7+ years at, but she would still put in an ungodly amount of hours. It is definitely a destructive repeating pattern for her, and she has severe PTSD + ADHD that I believe strongly inform this. She also tends to lash out at people when stressed. I have seen what her burnout looks like, and it is not pretty. She will recede into herself for months and not leave the house, barely the couch, and relies only on delivery for food and groceries. She always has one repeating cartoon show she plays on the TV at all times for comfort and background noise (it's been the same show for years).

I actually helped her out and got her a job at my company after she got fired in-between her last and current career, and she left it for this new job complaining that mine wasn't fulfilling or high enough of a pay grade for her.
In her defense, at my job, she made probably only half of what she made before. She is used to a certain kind of lifestyle, so I'm not surprised or upset, but to put it to perspective, she pays way less in bills and rent than I do and only has one dog and 3 cats and uses them as the excuse for needing to work so hard. I have a dog and cats too, and I'm doing alright enough on my paycheck, and I pay way more in rent. 
For context, her field of work is a WFH office job involving contracts. Her previous work was in insurance.

Recently, I let her know that I'm worried about her again, because it sounded like her boyfriend was very unhappy and she let me know VERY aggressively and in many words that she is sick of people telling her she works too much and how she cannot handle hearing it again, and I have no idea how to respond at this point. What she is doing is unsustainable. She just doubles down and is about to ""career woman"" herself to death and most likely out of relationships. I do not want to deal with her inevitable burnout again. AITA, should I just back off? 

Edited to clarify ""best"" friend, and added context for her field of work.",Not the A-hole,2024-05-31,"AITA for telling my friend she works too much My best friend started a new job three months ago and she consistently works 12-14 hour days, sometimes weekends. She always talks about how tired, miserable, and stressed she is, and her life right now is only work and sleep. She's so tired that on weekends when she doesn't work, she just sleeps the entire time and barely sees anyone or leaves the house. She cancels plans on everyone because she is always so tired. She will mentally spiral when over-stressed. I consider her to be a full-on workaholic. 

We never hang out anymore. I went from seeing her every other weekend, to seeing her maybe twice period since she started. Her partner, myself, and other loved ones have confronted her about her workaholic tendencies, and she doubles down saying that she started a new career and we need to lay off. 

Even before this, at her old job, she would work herself to death there too. I saw her more back then since it was a job she worked 7+ years at, but she would still put in an ungodly amount of hours. It is definitely a destructive repeating pattern for her, and she has severe PTSD + ADHD that I believe strongly inform this. She also tends to lash out at people when stressed. I have seen what her burnout looks like, and it is not pretty. She will recede into herself for months and not leave the house, barely the couch, and relies only on delivery for food and groceries. She always has one repeating cartoon show she plays on the TV at all times for comfort and background noise (it's been the same show for years).

I actually helped her out and got her a job at my company after she got fired in-between her last and current career, and she left it for this new job complaining that mine wasn't fulfilling or high enough of a pay grade for her.
In her defense, at my job, she made probably only half of what she made before. She is used to a certain kind of lifestyle, so I'm not surprised or upset, but to put it to perspective, she pays way less in bills and rent than I do and only has one dog and 3 cats and uses them as the excuse for needing to work so hard. I have a dog and cats too, and I'm doing alright enough on my paycheck, and I pay way more in rent. 
For context, her field of work is a WFH office job involving contracts. Her previous work was in insurance.

Recently, I let her know that I'm worried about her again, because it sounded like her boyfriend was very unhappy and she let me know VERY aggressively and in many words that she is sick of people telling her she works too much and how she cannot handle hearing it again, and I have no idea how to respond at this point. What she is doing is unsustainable. She just doubles down and is about to ""career woman"" herself to death and most likely out of relationships. I do not want to deal with her inevitable burnout again. AITA, should I just back off?

There's a woman in my office, I’ll  call her Sarah (27F). there is no other way to put it, she is quite overweight  

I have observed that she doesn't seem to be taken as seriously as the other employees. I’ve seen clients and higher-ups show more engagement when interacting with the slimmer employees and that during meetings, when she shares ideas or suggestions, her ideas are often overlooked or dismissed more quickly compared to the others 

The other day, we were both in the break room, and she was complaining about not getting the promotion she was hoping for. I hinted to her that maybe losing some weight would improve her chances, She was shocked and got angry at me, telling me I was nasty and insensitive. I told her that I had nothing against her and that I was just trying to help her out with some feedback. 

I like Sarah and I think she’s very good at her job, I just think losing weight would be good for her

Since then, she's been avoiding me, and a couple of other coworkers have hinted that my comment was out of line. I was in no way intending to offend her. I was just trying to give some friendly advice

95,1d4x4be,AITA for telling my exs new girlfriend she doesn’t seem the motherly type?,"I (45F) broke up with my ex (47M) 7 years ago after being together for 12 years, due to infidelity on his part. We have a 10 year old and 3 year old together, I will explain that later.

Ex has been with ""Nina"" (29, fake name) for 4 years - so yes me and my ex had our youngest whilst they were together, but ultimately she forgave him and it's not my problem. Both my children love her.

Nina is the free spirit type, she's nearly always on vacation or hiking or whatever it is she does, she's an artist...her hobbies don't bother me, the children enjoy going on trips and I like knowing they're getting those experiences, but the point is she's flighty, irresponsible and forgetful - you may ask how I know this? My ex texts me 9/10 when she's done something to upset him, usually he's in the wrong anyway like expecting her to cancel a trip because he had hurt himself which ended up being like a papercut. Nina doesn't know he texts me and I see no point in sharing.

Well I was recently told by my eldest that Nina is pregnant, so I congratulated her and we spoke briefly about motherhood - I said I'm surprised she's having a baby as she doesn't seem the motherly type, she didn't respond.

Ex texted me to say I'm bang out of order; I said I didn't mean it to sound rude, although it's ironic he's texting me about that when all he does is complain about her. My eldest is also upset with me claiming he heard his dad, because Nina didn't tell him, and it's ""mean"" because Nina is nice. I apologised, but still no response...my friends say I've put Nina through what my husband put me through and I'm just a ""nasty"" person sometimes. I apologised and I just meant it as a passing comment.

However since the summer break had already started, I am now staying with my parents house just like when I was in high school. Along our summer break came the announcement of the Dean and President's Lister, glory to God I was one of the Dean's Lister in our Department. (There was only 17 students that was listed.) Upon hearing the news, I decided to share it with my uncle to give him the assurance that his help are appreciated and worth it. 

Then a week after I shared him the news, he told me that he'd send me 2,500 pesos to celebrate alongside my sister's great achievement of being part of the with honors. I told my parents that uncle will be sending me the money, they then planned on what to buy for the celebration. My uncle called my phone and I told him to send the money through my Mother's account so that she can directly cashed it out of the app it was sent to, which my uncle did. 

The very same day my after my Mother cahed the money out she bought foods and for the small gathering, all in all she spent 1,000 pesos. This means we still have 1,500 pesos, since we no longer need anything I asked my Mother if I can have 500 pesos so I can put it on my piggy bank since I am saving money for next school year expenses. She did agreed but my father did not, he said that it should be used to buy foods. 

The next day, lunch time he bought a letchon manok worth 300 pesos despite knowing that my Mother already cooked veggie for lunch. Seeing my father's thick wallet I computed if there's money left, and of course there's still, exactly 1,150 pesos. I asked my Mother once more if I can have at least 300 pesos, I kinda did it in a whisper register so that my father can't hear it. She then agreed. I took my father's wallet and took 500 pesos, I then give my younger sister (the one with honors) and gave her 200 pesos.

When my father checked his wallet and noticed that the 500 pesos was missing, I did not told him that I was the one who took it because for sure he would take it back again.

97,1d4wgu3,"WIBTA/WWBTA if we confront a friend (Y) about her behavior?
","I did not expect it to be this long, please bear with me. TL;DR at the end. 

I am part of a friend group with 3 other people. Friend Y has a guy friend or, as we like to call him, her unlabeled partner. Since she met him, our outings or meetings have revolved around him in some way. This got worse after he flew down to meet her last year. She either talks about him, their meeting (almost a year ago), or has him join us via video or call.

Last week, we had a sleepover at Friend X's house. We spoke about him, their conversations, and she got him on a video call. We played online games, joked, and he even played his guitar. I didn't mind his presence and enjoyed his company. Before he left, he asked if we felt weird with him there. I joked that I didn’t because we were used to hearing about him non-stop.

Yesterday, Friend X asked if we (me, X, and Z) wanted to meet. She asked this in a group chat for Friend Y’s birthday, which doesn't include her. I was puzzled and asked X about it. It turns out X did mind him being there and disliked the constant conversations about him, feeling it ruined our girls’ night. Friend Z felt the same. They think Friend Y makes every conversation about herself and is rude if opposed. I've noticed her being rude if plans are canceled due to our parents not agreeing (not hers, they always agree).

Even before she met him, it was about her and her 'sob story.' I didn’t mind unless someone was interrupted or had something important to share. We did have chances to talk about ourselves. After talking to X, I suggested we address this tactfully with Y. She agreed. We will speak to Z to be on the same page. I consider myself neutral but worry if that will help or worsen things. If we don't address this, our friendship could have irreparable cracks.

So, will we be the aholes if we confront her?

TL;DR: Our friend group is increasingly dominated by Friend Y's relationship, bothering the rest of us. Friend X and Z feel it’s no longer just girls’ nights and that Y often makes everything about herself and reacts rudely when opposed. We've decided to address this with Y to prevent future damage to our friendship but are unsure how to do it tactfully.

I apologised for wanting to go early but just said I wasn't really enjoying it anymore and that I'd rather just go home.

The night was going well but after a couple of bars I really wasn't feeling it and wasn't having a good time and decided to call it a night. I told my gf that I was gonna head home but hope she has a great night.  
  
She got annoyed and told me that I shouldn't be leaving her and that now she has no one to get home with. I told her I'd be happy to book her a taxi when she's finished if I was still awake but she just repeated that I should be staying with her. I apologised for wanting to go early but just said I wasn't really enjoying it anymore and that I'd rather just go home.  
  
I said she can let me know when she's leaving so I can book her a taxi and make sure she gets back to our apartment if I'm still awake but she just said I shouldn't be leaving her.  
  
I just repeated that I hope she has a good night and then left. The next morning she repeated that I shouldn't have left here and that I should've stayed.

101,1d4tkxt,WIBTA for not buying a phone my wife wants me to? ,"Throwaway. On phone. English isn't my first language.  
This is a stupid and trivial question, I apologize, but this is causing me some confusion. details are deliberately very vague, I apologize.

I (M31) have a question. My wife(F31) wants me to buy a $2K phone. She says it would look good when I am with my colleagues and would suit the position I am in. I work in a F500 company leading the efforts for the country and the larger geographical region I am in. Multiple teams report to me internally and I frequently have to meet clients as the face of this company here. (This is deliberately vague as this is identifying information.) She got me an iPhone 3 years ago, again saying the same thing. It works fine - not a scratch except the battery drains faster now.

The thing is, the phone she wants me to buy now is expensive - and I just cannot justify myself spending that amount of money on a phone. Yet I am doubting myself (And hence I am writing here) - cuz she's usually right about these social things. We've been together for over 10 years now, married for 5 and I am admittedly an introvert. I usually don't care about such stuff and she knows that, so she has to push me towards these decisions. I'll admit she has a keen eye for what looks good and what doesn't. She's usually the center of attention anywhere we go cuz (don't blame me for crushing on my wife) she's this pretty, attractive girl. 

I also go with her judgement cuz she grew up with a normal family with both parents, therefore she's better adjusted to social situations. I didn't have that privilege. From the time I was 9, I grew up with only me to look after myself. I stayed on roads, in hostels - whatever to get me by. Eventually, one of my relatives paid for my college which I completed. This isn't self pity. Just thought I'd add relevant context. I just didn't really have a family to tell me what's normal or not. 

Also, before someone asks - I can afford it. It won't even matter. I just cannot see $2K being a good use on a phone. We've spent more on (what I consider) meaningful experiences - impromptu Disneyland trip cuz that was her dream, took her to Vatican for Christmas cuz she is a believer and I am an atheist, etc. This I don't find meaningful. She does. She left for work in a huff today and hasn't been taking my calls and we are at an impasse.

102,1d4t4gn,AITA for having a go at my partner as he won’t come on a trip for my brothers birthday? ,"So for a back story. My partner works crazy shifts, night shifts and late and early shifts. This means he’s usually unable to make it to any parties that we’re both invited to, meaning I go alone a lot. I don’t really enjoy it but I appreciate there’s nothing he can do. 

We were invited to my cousins wedding, he declined the invite as he doesn’t know my entire family and felt like he’d be the odd one out. Also declined as he didn’t want to pay for train fare and accommodation. I was upset by this but I held it in, we both got invited to a friends wedding next year, he said it’s a weekend where no one in his business is allowed any leave, so he can’t come. Another one down. 

We do go on holidays together and have a couple of trips booked, as well as he is trying to save money for moving out in the next year or so, so he uses this as an excuse a lot. We are due to go on holiday at the end of June for 7 days and have also just got back from a weekend away with another couple. My mother planned for us to go on a weekend trip for my younger brothers birthday, the week before we go away in June.

That it was too much money and he didn’t want to spend too much as we were going on holiday together the week after. 

I am very disappointed and feel let down, like he never goes out of his way for my family events and that he doesn’t care to be my plus one to things.

Originally we were supposed to be a group of 4. But 2 of them noticed that they had a missing requirement and had to leave the group. Ok fine, me and the other person do it alone then. 

Month 1 
The whole month I was doing the planning and early coding models on my own. Cause the other person said, she has to do other projects in other courses and then will help once she is done with that. Fine by me. 
I on the other hand have classes that constantly need the same attention or else I fall off. So I have been having the same constant amount of exercises to do and things to study for exams. 
So I did the planning, created a database with sql. Not a perfect one, cause obviously I didn’t have the time either. Created a connection to that database per python and did functions
and stuff to access that database. 

Month 2 
Throught half the month parter is finally done with the other projects. Mind, she doesn’t have any exams in those classes so she got alot more free time than me now. 
I still have the same, even more due to the classes getting more complex, workload. 
She then complains that the database I created isn’t perfect yet and changes like 3 things and makes it look like she worked hours to fix my mistakes. (I checked per github, literally just changed one int to char and some spelling mistakes).

Month 3 
She complains that she can’t understand my code and over writes and changes everything. I marked stuff as don’t touch I’ll do that later. She did that stuff. 
Now she acts like I did nothing. 
I say that I did the complete foundation of the project and that I just can’t be as fast as she is, cause I have more workload than she does. 
Well guess who now has the honour to write the 40 page documentation on the project. 


Yes me. 
Cause she couldn’t keep her hands off the stuff I clearly marked as I’ll do that do mot touch. 
Cause she overwrote my code.

In between I then was supposed to do front end (created the website) did that. The website wasn’t pretty enough for her so she threw away my work and did it herself. 

Like the whole project is just me doing something and then her throwing that away and doing it her way. And then I said that this is the reason why I’m a single player and got blamed.

110,1d4s354,WIBTA for refusing to give my friends money for petrol since they offered to pick me up? ,"Alt account since they follow me on my main. 
First, a bit of back story. I've known this couple for about 12 years. I met them through my now ex partner and we clicked well for a long time. Even after my ex and I broke up, I was still friends with these guys. We've done Birthdays, Christmases and all the fun things together many times since. About 2-3 years ago however, they stopped talking to me. No explanation why, just radio silence. No longer friends on FB or anything. Not even on PSN. Found out later that my ex had made plans to go to a concert with a pair of her friends, but didn't invite the girlfriend of the couple, despite the fact that she's a big fan of the artist. This happened around the time they stopped talking to me, so I concluded that I was collateral damage in this petty bullshit.  
Fast forward to about a week ago. Out of the blue I get a call from the couple wishing me an early happy birthday. It's a lovely surprise and I'm touched.

First, a bit of back story. I've known this couple for about 12 years. I met them through my now ex partner and we clicked well for a long time. Even after my ex and I broke up, I was still friends with these guys. We've done Birthdays, Christmases and all the fun things together many times since. About 2-3 years ago however, they stopped talking to me. No explanation why, just radio silence. No longer friends on FB or anything. Not even on PSN. Found out later that my ex had made plans to go to a concert with a pair of her friends, but didn't invite the girlfriend of the couple, despite the fact that she's a big fan of the artist. This happened around the time they stopped talking to me, so I concluded that I was collateral damage in this petty bullshit.  
Fast forward to about a week ago. Out of the blue I get a call from the couple wishing me an early happy birthday. It's a lovely surprise and I'm touched. We talk and catch up for a while before she mentions that they're having a birthday celebration for her sister next week and I'm invited to come along and celebrate my own birthday too as sort of a mini add-on (I'll be 35, so that's cool).

He didn't date at all while my siblings and I were kids. His wife is fine. She's not my favorite person and I find her a little off when it comes to her relationship with me and my siblings. They feel the same. She gives the vibe that she expected to be accepted as our motherly figure instead of as our dad's partner/wife. We're close to dad. He has never given us the same vibe. He'll still hang out with us individually without his wife or each other around. But she definitely gives that vibe. It's weird to me because we were all adults and I'm the baby of the family so my siblings were even older when she married our dad. And to think she would fill any kind of mom role, in my mind, is weird.

My dad loves her though and he's happy and she's nice enough other than this so we don't rock the boat.

However this is now a situation where I did start to rock the boat and I wonder if I'm TA for that. So my fiancée Ellie and I are getting married and we decided we both wanted to walk down the aisle. She wanted to walk with her parents so I thought it'd be kinda cool to ask my dad. He said yes. He got really emotional about it. He said he wished my mom could be here to walk with us and yeah, I do too, so much.

My dad's wife later approached me and told me she would gladly walk me down the aisle instead and she wanted me to know that I hadn't needed to ask my dad instead. I asked her what she meant and she assumed I wanted her but was afraid to ask. I told her that wasn't what I wanted at all. She told me that was unexpected and when she heard I had asked dad she expected I would want her instead. So I asked her why she expected to walk me down the aisle when she is not my mom. She looked so offended when I asked her and she told me I didn't need to be so tactless about it. I told her I was genuinely asking and told her I couldn't understand. She then said she clearly misunderstood the relationship she has with me and my siblings and I can keep my thoughtless questions to myself.

My dad was so confused by her reaction too. I told him what happened and he had no idea. She is really pissed off though.

I still pay rent and and a job and can be independent if I could find a place for cheap. 

I'm agnostic, and my mom is very atheist who thinks the Bible is nonsense and thinks that people pushing religion onto others is bad. At least, that's what I would say about her, if not for literally two days ago she started believing in God, Jesus, the Bible, the rapture, everything she's chastised before. She keeps telling me about her spiritual journey and wants me to watch the religious TikToks she's been watching to try and convince me to believe with her. She's also believing in conspiracy theories like we're all living in the matrix, that the Pyramids once had man-harnessed electricity flowing through them, there's a massive sea dragon swimming through the ocean, and that the government wants to ban TikTok because it's a religious vessel that God spreads His word through. She genuinely thinks the world is ending and keeps telling me all the omens of a crumbling society and that God will rapture everyone vibrating on His wavelength. 

I try to tell her that she sounds insane, that dragons don't really exist, and that everything she's saying goes against her beliefs that she's had for 20 years, but she doubles down or laughs it off. She said she knows it sounds crazy, but if I watch the stupid TikToks she's seen I'd realize it's the truth. 

I try to be respectful of people's religions even if I don't believe in what they believe, but my mom sounds genuinely insane and it's terrifying. I tried to tell her she's acting like the religious nuts who spread harmful rhetoric (who she used to hate) and conspiracy theorists and she either denies, or doesn't care. She tells me how she's the happiest she's ever been now that she knows the truth and is vibrating with God and doesn't know why I'm trying to ruin that. 

I want to give her an ultimatum, tell her to snap out of it and stop being religious or I'm not going to talk to her ever again. Losing her daughter in her life would crush her. I don't want to punish my sib though, so I might not move out, just refuse to talk to my mom when we're in the same house. 

I know telling someone to stop being spiritual is so disrespectful, discriminatory, and unethical, but this is different, right? If you would have given her a Bible a month ago she would have thrown it away, but give her one today and she'd tell you how it's the secret to unlocking the escape room of life and God just had a sense of humor and knack for riddles while writing it, and that you should read it and open your eyes to His reality.

I have two siblings, five half siblings total and four stepsiblings. I also have two involved parents and two stepparents. In my whole family I am closest to my two siblings.

I don't hate anyone. But would I say they're all equally important to me or the people I care most about? No. So when one of my teachers asked us two months ago to do a project about our families and who we're closest to and how well we know them, I asked her for a different project topic and explained I was concerned about the reaction from my stepfamilies if I was honest and also worried it would show if I was lying. So she gave me a totally different topic to cover. Another kid also got it after I did because they have a very complicated family situation. 

I did the project, got an A on it and didn't think more about it. But the school posted the wall of projects on social media and my mom searched for mine and saw it was different. She told my stepdad and then my dad and stepmom were told and it became a discussion in both houses. I lied and said I had been asked to do it because of the other kid.

I told them I was trying to avoid any conflict or hurt feelings by asking something else. They told me it was wrong for me to do that because it looks like I don't love my family.

119,1d4qpth,AITA for eating my sister's vegetarian bacon?,"My (17) sister (15) is the only full time vegetarian in our house, and our parents get some vegetarian alternatives when they go shopping. Last week my mum bought a pack of facon for my sister as well as a pack of bacon for the rest of us.

My sister is quite lazy and usually gets our mum to make her breakfast if she is up in time for it (currently school holidays for her and she doesn't get up until the afternoon if given a choice). 

When I made my breakfast this morning there was no bacon left, but two slices of the vegetarian facon. So I ate them and it was tasty enough (I later checked the packaging and the best before date was 2 days ago).

Now my sister is mad at me because I ate the facon that had just been sitting in the fridge for almost a week, but the shopping is done tomorrow so if she wants more she can just wake up earlier and go shopping with my mum. AITA?

- There was cereal and bread available for both of us
- The facon was bought on Saturday, expired on Wednesday, I ate it on Friday. My sister had the other 4 slices on Saturday and Sunday.

120,1d4qdhq,WIBTA If I went somewhere far without my parents knowing?,"
I (M18) recently started chatting with another guy (M20). We have talked for a couple of weeks now and he is really sweet and we both know that we like each other. Normally I am pretty hesitant about these kind of online relationship buildups, but he is very kind, attractive and overall a sweet boy. We talked about meeting up someday to have an actual date to see if things are going well irl too.

There is a big problem however. I live in a (mildly strict) household, but also a religious household. I  That means that they don't allow me being gay. Growing up I have been taught to be very religious, but don't consider myself a religious person anymore. I never told them this cause i'm scared, the same counts for telling them that I am gay. This meant that they didn't really like my friends, which were all ""white female atheïst who do not share our norms and values"" (their words, which I understand). I was never allowed to go out with friends, travel or do anything remotely fun without my parents constantly worrying where I am and what I am doing. I understand that they wanted me to adhere to their norms and values, and I respect that, but i don't have the same norms anymore.

A couple years ago (when I was 16), I was caught having a date with some other guy and got a lot of backlash from that. They said that if I ever did something like that again, there would be severe concequences. My father even told me he was not going to be calling me ""his son"" again if I did. A part of me wants me to believe he was just angry in the moment (as he is a lot of times), but another part thinks he meant it.

Back to the problem: I am not allowed to go to another city without a specific reason (could be hair salon, shopping) etc. This meant it would be really hard for me to find a way to meet him. I suddenly remembered that I told them once that I was going to an amusement park with friends somewhere in another town (which they allowed), and I was thinking about using that as excuse to instead meet with him (or perhaps go with him to that same amusement park instead of friends, if he wants).

When the last accident happened, they told me that they also didn't like it that I lied to them about what I was doing, and said that they couldn't trust me anymore and that I needed earn it back, which I did.

He asked me to take care of his daughter since he was busy fixing his bicycle while his wife is busy cooking, of course I did. Two hours passed, his wife finished cooking while he wraps up. I remained sitting their daughter while I let them had lunch, their daughter was too young to consume the foods her mother cooked. While eating, one of our neighbor my brother's wife's friend came and chatted with my brother's wife while eating lunch. 25 minutes passed my brother finished eating and went back fixing, while his wife asked me to eat lunch since she was done eating.

We have a boy and a girl name chosen. The choices generally are compromises. We didn't agree on names really and had different beliefs around names, I guess. He believes in formal names and kids having really solid middle names as well. I believe in naming the child what you want to call them, something I got from my parents who named me and my siblings that way and my siblings went onto do the same. For example, I'm Lainey. Just Lainey. I don't have a more formal version of my name. I never felt like I needed a more formal name. My name works for me as a 34 year old woman just as much as it did when I was 4.

This led to some trouble for us because I gravitate more to names my husband considers nicknames. I found his choices very stuffy and unappealing and he found my juvenile.

But he liked Theodora and I liked Thea and we agreed eventually to the full name for him but I'd always use Thea. For a boy we went with Declan for him and Dex for me. Again with him using Declan and me Dex.

But my husband doesn't like that I only say Thea or Dex. It bothers him that the full name gets ignored and he said he believes my family and a lot of our friends will use the names I do. I told him the compromise only worked on the grounds that was okay, that he could use the full and I could use the nickname. He said the full name seems like it will be ignored otherwise and I should use both to make it more fair and I told him that's just him getting his way.

I told him if he wants a better compromise then he better come back to the table willing to look at different names. Before names like Brynn, Lyra, Piper and Freya were ruled out by him for not meeting his standards of formal. because they're shorter names. He said they were nickname light. But shorter more formal names feels like the only other possible compromise for us and he doesn't agree. So I told him he needs to accept what we already compromised on or we find a better compromise which doesn't mean him getting his way. He told me I'm very dismissive of his concerns and I told him I was already going with a legal name I didn't care for under our compromise so he should be more willing to work with me if he wants to change the names.

I also want to say my neighbors are Turkish, so during this whole situation, I am *very* mindful of the language barrier.

They moved in almost a year ago. My mom and I have been looking/thinking about moving due to *a lot* of drama and trauma in her past relationship here, and when the neighbors moved in my mom felt like she couldn't maintain BOTH of her gardens, so she gave the neighbors the big side. My mom has a 10 year old rose bush that she specifically used as a marker: ""I plant where the roses are, you can have the rest."" She is very friendly to them, and only the husband speaks English, so she explained that to him. 

Ever since they moved in they take a mile of the inch my mom gives them. Landlord gave them the side of the driveway that fits two (2) cars. Well they have four (4) and tried parking them all over, including our side. We address that.

We have one (1) trash bin per each apartment. They overfill our trash bin with their trash and not even in bags. Just loose trash in the bin so the raccoons make a mess of it. We address that.

Well yesterday my mom texted me saying the neighbors ripped up her flower buds and planted bean stalks. She was so frustrated that snipped them with scissors and told me to let her address it.

I absolutely snapped. My mom and I have been through a lot. The garden is the only thing that makes her happy anymore, especially after my grandma died. I know she's lonely, and bored, and life has been hard. I heard one of the neighbors outside and I went out there and because they have so many people in and out, I just assumed it was the wife who speaks *okay* English and told her off. 

She goes upstairs and retrieves the wife and husband who *actually* live here (first woman was just a friend I guess) and the wife is livid. Immediately she goes ""No cut"" and gets in my face. So me and her go back and forth until her husband comes downstairs and he is ADAMANT that his wife is right.

126,1d4px9a,AITA for getting a bf?,"Throw away acc. I 17F recently started dating my bf 17M. This isn't the first time I've dated but it's the first time I've felt that I liked the guy enough to introduce him to my family.

For a little context my mom 32F had me at a young age her and my father 31M relationship didn't work out but he stayed in my life, my mom has always been competitive with me.

Mentioning every time I've gained weight, saying my clothes would look better on her, saying I'm not natural pretty like her so I need make up.

Or making sly comments like ""oh your wearing that?"" Or once saying ""guys don't think your actually my daughter because of how much more pretty I am"". Then when I get upset she'll say I'm just joking and I take things to seriously. That's just a few things but I've always done my best at brushing them off.

But recently I invited my boyfriend over to meet my mom and a few other family members, every seemed to like him except for my mom, after everyone left she completely went off on me saying things like: I never said you can have a boyfriend ( when I was 15 she said once I was 16 I could date) and how could I have the nerve to bring my bf around knowing she's single and that I was the reason she was (her last bf was really creepy and I told my dad and he said he'd keep me if she didn't handle it)

After she finished calling me names and yelling she just left and I didn't see her till the afternoon the next day when my bf was walking me home from school and she stopped us outside, the whole time she was being a lot more talkative to my boyfriend unlike the previous night and I would have been happy if i couldn't tell my boyfriend was extremely uncomfortable.

He told her that she was being to close and then said bye to me, when me and my mom got inside she started yelling again saying I need to leave him because he was obviously coming on to her and he's going to cheat on me because she's to pretty. I was honestly really upset and left to my room to call my dad and see if I can stay with him but he asked my mom what was going on.

And now I feel really bad because she's been saying how can I leave her and I'm all she has and I'm a shitty daughter for leaving her, I love my mom and she's my closest friend and she loves me, and I feel bad for making her so upset but I'm upset to, and I feel like a asshole for trying to leave. ",Not the A-hole,2024-05-31,"AITA for getting a bf? Throw away acc. I 17F recently started dating my bf 17M. This isn't the first time I've dated but it's the first time I've felt that I liked the guy enough to introduce him to my family.

For a little context my mom 32F had me at a young age her and my father 31M relationship didn't work out but he stayed in my life, my mom has always been competitive with me.

Mentioning every time I've gained weight, saying my clothes would look better on her, saying I'm not natural pretty like her so I need make up.

Or making sly comments like ""oh your wearing that?"" Or once saying ""guys don't think your actually my daughter because of how much more pretty I am"". Then when I get upset she'll say I'm just joking and I take things to seriously. That's just a few things but I've always done my best at brushing them off.

But recently I invited my boyfriend over to meet my mom and a few other family members, every seemed to like him except for my mom, after everyone left she completely went off on me saying things like: I never said you can have a boyfriend ( when I was 15 she said once I was 16 I could date) and how could I have the nerve to bring my bf around knowing she's single and that I was the reason she was (her last bf was really creepy and I told my dad and he said he'd keep me if she didn't handle it)

After she finished calling me names and yelling she just left and I didn't see her till the afternoon the next day when my bf was walking me home from school and she stopped us outside, the whole time she was being a lot more talkative to my boyfriend unlike the previous night and I would have been happy if i couldn't tell my boyfriend was extremely uncomfortable.

He told her that she was being to close and then said bye to me, when me and my mom got inside she started yelling again saying I need to leave him because he was obviously coming on to her and he's going to cheat on me because she's to pretty.

129,1d4pimn,AITA for not inviting my friends to my 19th birthday celebration? ,"Am I the asshole for not inviting my friends to my 19th birthday celebration?

Yesterday marked my 19th birthday, a day I wasn't particularly looking forward to. In fact, the realization only dawned on me the night before, around 8:00 PM on May 29th, 2024. My family and I were lounging in the living room when my youngest sibling innocently inquired about the date. It was then that my older sister casually reminded me that my birthday was the following day, May 30th. 

Celebrating my birthday has never been a source of joy for me. I've always approached mine with indifference, if not outright dread. The customary festivities usually entail a modest gathering with immediate family and a few neighbors or extended relatives. While others receive warm wishes from friends both in real life and on social media, my own birthday is typically a low-key affair.

Living in the Philippines, there's a cultural tradition where, during celebrations like birthdays, it's common to share food with neighbors and extended family.  There are several reasons for this. Firstly, my family struggles financially, and any celebration we have is often constrained by limited resources. Secondly, as one of many siblings, our meals are often stretched to accommodate everyone, leaving little room for guests. Finally, my outgoing nature contrasts with our modest means; I have a wide circle of friends but rarely entertain them at home.

Reflecting on past experiences, I recall a particularly poignant moment from my childhood. In second grade, I casually mentioned to friends at school that my birthday was approaching. Innocently, one of them expressed interest in joining the celebration. At the time, I didn't fully comprehend the implications of their request or the financial constraints my family faced. When I relayed the news to my parents, their reaction was one of surprise and concern. They gently explained our situation, assuring me that while there would be food, it would be in limited supply.

The prospect of disappointing my friends weighed heavily on me. As the days passed, I found myself avoiding our usual hangout spot at the municipal park, unable to face the embarrassment of admitting the truth. When my birthday arrived, we did indeed have a modest feast, but my heart ached with the knowledge that I had let down my friends.

Since that day, I've made a conscious decision not to invite anyone to my birthday celebrations. It's not out of malice or a desire to exclude, but rather a protective measure born out of necessity. I've come to terms with our family's financial struggles and harbor no resentment towards my parents. I admire their resilience and the sacrifices they've made to provide for us.

We originally met while I was visiting my dad who lives in the same area as her, but have always dated long distance. I visit very frequently to see both her and my dad. We always planned on me moving to her state once my first year of college had wrapped up, since we could be together in person and I would be able to live with my dad for a while.

Recently while I was doing research on schools, I was unable to find any good ones there that had good programs for what I wanted to pursue. I did however find a school on the west coast, which was very close to my brother's place and offered the perfect program for me. My brother has been looking for someone to live with in order to split the rent which has started to become too much for him to tackle alone. I decided it would work out perfectly if I went and shared his apartment despite being bummed about not living around my girlfriend.

When I told her about my new idea she was unsurprisingly sad, but to my shock it very quickly turned to anger. She told me she felt completely blindsided and betrayed by this and that she feels like I don't care about her as much as I care about school. She was very mad because we had planned on me living near her for over a year and now it feels like I'm backing out at the last minute. I tried to explain that we've handled long distance really well this whole time and that this wouldn't be much different. She said the increased distance would make it even harder to visit, and she doesn't understand why I care so much about the program since most people end up changing their majors anyway and she assumes I would do the same. I told her I think she's being unfair and just overreacting in the moment (which I understand was probably not the best choice of words) to which she hung up on me and hasn't responded in over 24 hours despite me apologizing.

I never said that this was absolutely my new plan, just that it was a strong possibility, but her reaction has me worried that I'm being inconsiderate of her feelings on the matter and that I'm not doing enough to find something we could both be happy with.

My parents think I’m an AH for accepting the offer when my uncle isn’t very wealthy, but it’s not as if I demanded or asked him to buy anything, or even mentioned my earrings, he offered of his own free will.

137,1d4o2zb,WIBTA if I refuse to pay for my mother's passport so she can join my trip to visit my boyfriend for a week?,"Hey, Reddit. Longtime lurker here, but on a burner account to keep things more anonymous.

So some context. I (male) recently turned 21, and my boyfriend (22) lives in another country that isn't far from the US. All throughout my life, I've been the typical socially isolated nerd. When I was young, my parents promised me that, due to me having some mental disorders and a hard time getting myself out there, that they would never force me out of the house until I was ready, and would support me in any ways they can. This was far before I even turned 18, mind you.

Two years ago, me and Connor (fake name) finally decided to start dating each other after knowing each other online for a long time. He's helped me through my darkest moments, and is a constant light in my depressive spiral. He's no catfish - he came down for a week a few months ago, and it was the best week of our lives. While I haven't flown or even travelled out of state before, we decided that I would go to his place instead.

That's when my parents enter the picture. They've constantly been on my ass about getting a move on with my life, trying to push me forwards to stuff I'm not comfortable doing, but with Connor's emotional help, I landed myself an overnight job. Our deal was simple - I would try to get my license soon after winter, my mom would take me at night, and my dad would pick me up in the mornings. However not only did my mom contemplate hounding me for a license a mere month after starting, she eventually stopped taking me at all - leaving my morning person of a father to take me at nights, sleep for 5 hours, and then pick me up.

However one night she decided to take me, she insinuated that it was MY fault, and I should either get a full time job, or take different, longer hours. My current job hours are perfect for me, there's no customers and hardly any employee interaction. She also still hounds me about moving on with life, trying to rush me out. My dad's not much better either, wanting to discuss the ""cost of living"" with me and my mom. What's that gonna do, make me feel even MORE like a disappointment when I don't reach a number tied to my name?

Now, to the trip; When Connor came over a few months ago, my mom initially wanted us to postpone it, as she would be recovering from surgery and ""didn't want to miss time with him."" Not only did her surgery only leave a few noticeable scars, she was completely fine.

When I brought up that I wanted to fly to Connor's place for a week, she immediately got defensive and heavily insinuated some 'freak accident' that could happen, and how she needed to come with. Problem is, she's tight on funds, and wanted ME to pay for her passport alongside mine - she even filled hers out when I asked how to fill out mine!

Closer to time to meet, there were no signs of her. I called her and she let me know that she’s doing 3 heads of hair instead of 1 (she’s a hairstylist). I asked when she’d get to my house and she said she’d leave as soon as she can. When she arrived, she offered to pay for an Uber as it was because of her that we’d be late. I agreed to this, and come to the time to order the Uber, she let me know that she didn’t have the Uber app, and that I should order it and she’ll send me the money, so I ordered the Uber. Tickets for the party were $30 cash only and she didn’t have cash, so she asked me to use my cash to pay for her, and that she’d send the $30 alongside the Uber money. I asked her to send me the money which had totaled to about $70, but she only sent me $30. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I hadn’t gotten the remaining money. When I asked her about the money she told me that she had been kicked out of her home, and that she was figuring things out. I told her I understood and hoped her situation would get better. A week later I was out with friends and we decided to buy a bottle, but we were nowhere near the nearest LCBO. My friend Lisa lived near the LCBO so I asked her if she could buy us the bottle, and I’ll come to pick it up, she agreed and I sent her $15. As my friends and I made our way over to her, she texted me saying she wasn’t able to get the bottle, but never sent back the money. Two weeks after, I texted her and asked her for the now $55, no response. I double-texted two days later and once again no response.

I let her know that she should’ve paid me back a long time ago and that I was understanding with her situations, but that it seemed like she’s avoiding paying me back and I need my money.

139,1d4nv5c,"AITA for ""stealing"" from my former coworker?","This is a very long situation so I will try to keep it as brief as possible and answer any questions in comments or updates.

I (20F) used to work to work at a bagels and coffee store with my former coworker we'll call Kacy (21F). We were part of a friend group involving many of our coworkers, former coworkers, and a customer. Kacy lives my close friends so I was often over at their house. What kicked off this whole situation, and the title of the post is I went over to their house to visit my friend we'll call Dan (20NB), after we went to a small concert, Dan does not drink and it was just weeks after New Years eve, they know I do and they offered me a bottle of svedka that was not touched for several weeks and they knew that I liked, so I took it home with me. Kacy was in the kitchen was this exchange was happening and told me goodbye and watched me leave with it.

The next week the whole friend group was going to do a drunk game night at Dan and Kacy's house and I brought the svedka back with me. When I walked in Kacy told me that it was her svedka and that I had taken it from her and then when I told her that Dan had given it to me, she said I know but it's still mine. I told her I brought it back for us to drink anyways, and then I tried to move on and enjoy the night but it got brought up again and it turns out my now roommate was the one who paid for it and was never paid back for it by Kacy.

Not to long after at work I had to go into the walk in to organize it, and in our office we had a ton of jackets left by employees or customers. I asked around the people on shift to see if the jacket I was borrowing belonged to anyone and they said it did not so I borrowed. While I was in the walk in Kacy came in for her shift and when I came out I was freezing so I was still wearing the jacket. Kacy came up to me and asked to examine the jacket, after doing so she told me it was her's, I apologized and told her why I was wearing it and that I didn't know it was hers. She walked away and did not ask me to take it off, I put it back in the office when I left for the day. 

Kacy would later complain to Dan that I was stealing multiple things from her, that she didn't trust me, that she didn't want me in her house, if I was in her house when she wasn't there that she wanted Dan to lock her bedroom door, that she didn't want me to sleep over on the couch when I'm drunk, and that she was uncomfortable around me, this ended up causing a massive rift in our friend group that I am will to explain more but I don't want this post to get to long.

But my husband’s maternal aunt gave me one of her grandmother’s rings for Christmas year before last.  A beautiful opal & diamond piece.  And then his paternal uncle gifted me my husband’s great-grandmother’s “mother’s ring” that is gold set with the 9 birthstones of her children.  I am incredibly honored to have both.  

So now I have 2 pieces of heirloom jewelry from my husband’s side.  Both are too small (I have large fingers).  I want to get them sized, or if necessary reset into one piece that I can wear daily.  

Now where I am questioning myself.  This came up at a recent family gathering.  I don’t remember how.  And now my MIL and husband’s (maternal) cousins are blowing my phone up for even thinking about “destroying” the rings and saying things like I need to give them back since I don’t appreciate them as they are.

And then his paternal uncle gifted me my husband’s great-grandmother’s “mother’s ring” that is gold set with the 9 birthstones of her children.  I am incredibly honored to have both.  

So now I have 2 pieces of heirloom jewelry from my husband’s side.  Both are too small (I have large fingers).  I want to get them sized, or if necessary reset into one piece that I can wear daily.  

Now where I am questioning myself.  This came up at a recent family gathering.  I don’t remember how.  And now my MIL and husband’s (maternal) cousins are blowing my phone up for even thinking about “destroying” the rings and saying things like I need to give them back since I don’t appreciate them as they are.  

So.  WIBTA if I had them altered?  

TL;DR I was given two rings that belonged to my husband’s great-grandmothers.  I need to have them sized or possibly combined.  AITA if I alter family heirloom jewelry?",1.0,0.02183656021952629,0,0

We have 3 kids (12, 9, and 6) all of which have special needs (ADHD, autism, allergies and asthma). Until recently I have been a stay at home mom for 12 of the last 14 years.

146,1d4ngw8,AITA for exposing my ex friends after they blew up at me for a misscommunication?,"(I have no idea how to work reddit, this is my 1st time)

I(19f) just turned 19 two weeks ago, while my (ex) friend B (22nb) also turned 22 the same week. Our mutual (ex)friend J (21m) blew up at me for mentioning that our party that we had previously planned weeks before was comming up the next day. J and I had been friends for almost 5 years, while B and i had been friends for 2, since J introduced us.  
  
 B had stated that they were okay with the timing and everything was set. I was trying to communicate with them for a while to see what we could do, and if the timing was still okay. Well B, a week before the party came to us in a mutual setting stating that they were not sure if they could attend. I read it, but failed to reply or acknowledge it through text.. While J, also did the same. he blatantly ignored B, and proceeded to post photos of the northern lights. Fast forward to the day before the supposed party was supposed to happen, that just so happened to be B's birthday. I wished them a hbd and later on ""announced"" that the party was tmrw. The party was going to be us online playing games since we lived in different states. Our groupchat consisted of around 6ish people while maybe 4 were going to show up for this. About 5 minutes later J, blows up at me saying im petty and inconsiderate for not thinking about B's feelings, but when i said we could do something another day, and apologized for it he continuted to yell at me, and even started yelling at my partner E(19). I had also explained how i didnt think to privately message B since i was having an off week with stuff going on at home, so it skipped my mind, as everyone was planning the party together in the groupchat. Again, B never explicitly said they could or couldn't attend after priorly saying **yes** to our plans. I assumed they were still free since no one mentioned anything otherwise.. a huge miscommunication on both ends, by not asking and not telling eachother if we were still free. I acknowledge it was shitty of me to just assume and not double check, but i apologized atleast 5 times.  
  
 Adding that both B & J ignored my apologies to them, and decided to go to one of our mutal ex friends, and ""expose"" me for being a bad person..  Back ground on why im a ""bad person"" I had called someone a borederline >!minor lover!<  since T(23) was flirting and dming minors 15 - 17. I thought it was weird and mentioned it to them both..

so, out of all of our siblings, i'm still the only one who has contact with my older brother. my mom and dad thinks i don't talk to him anymore because it's easier that way (during the early days of the fight when they were just not talking to each other my mom would use me to talk to him which my older brother understood why bc i really can't say no to my parents). now though, no one's talking to each other except for legal stuff.

my brother's told me that he can't deal with anything my parents at the moment because it flares up his panic attacks which i understand bc every time i come back from my parents' house i really also can't function well. i try to avoid talking about my mom and dad unless it's something that's urgent to him. 

so here's where i'm conflicted.

149,1d4n6xb,AITA for telling my best friend she needs to think more about her boyfriend of <1 month moving in ,"My best friend of 12 years (26f) recently told me that her boyfriend (24) of almost 4 weeks is going to move in with her in about 5 weeks. 

A little background - she got divorced a year ago and has been dating since, with 1 or 2 exclusive (but not long) relationships. She met this guy on Tinder about 7 weeks ago. 5 weeks ago they made things official and 4 weeks later  she told me he was moving in with her in a month and a half. She had a rough divorce and has told me on multiple occasions that she doesnt want to move in with a man again unless she is positive it is serious. This new boyfriend also currently lives in an apartment under his ex’s lease, as he moved in with her and it didn’t work out and she let him stay there while she moved out. 

I told my friend via text that I was disappointed she was making this decision. I said I support her, however I don’t support this decision and I believe they’re very much still in the honeymoon stage. I reminded her of what she’s said in the past regarding moving in with someone, and also said her boyfriend’s current living situation is a prime example of why she should think about this more. 

She got extremely upset with me as she was excited about the move and I did not share that excitement with her.

151,1d4mo22,AITA Told mom she embarrassed me,"Tonight I invited my mom and dad to dinner, along with my husband, 21 year old son and his girlfriend. This was a dinner for my son as he leaves for a month for ROTC advanced training tomorrow. Prior to dinner, my mom was arguing with me over coming to the ROTC training graduation (which is over a month away). My son wants the event to be low key because he’s already in the National Guard and already had the pomp and circumstance at his Army basic training graduation. 

Fast forward to dinner, I sat next to her and across from my son’s girlfriend. Throughout dinner, my mom sat where her back was slightly turned to me, she was short with me, yet trying to be “cool grandma” with my son by bragging about how much she likes tequila, wanting to see Kid Rock, talking about pot, etc. I was embarrassed but said nothing. She even tried to usurp the relationship I’m trying to form with the GF by telling her they should go and get their nails done while my son is gone (which I mentioned to my mom days ago that I mentioned that to the GF). Mom has a history of needing to be the most loved and when she doesn’t feel, plays the victim. 

Dinner ended abruptly (we were in a public restaurant) when mom questioned my dad about charges on the bank account (yes, she was texting and surfing while dining) and my dad asked her if she was watching him like a hawk. She got extremely upset and told him he was over the line and to apologize now. She then started crying, stood up with her purse, went to my son and hugged him while crying and left. 

I sent her a text (because history has shown you can’t have a rational conversation) that I was embarrassed by her behavior and that my son should feel proud of having his family around. I told her I don’t want to see this behavior again. Trust me, this is far from the first time she’s had an outburst with family or in front of my friends. She texted me and told me it won’t be a problem because she doesn’t want to be around me, that I’m not innocent, and that our family is assholes. Then she blocked me on FB after she posted that the best day in your life is the day you die. 

I’ve dealt with these tantrums my whole life. I’ve been very purposeful to not act like this when raising my son.

She admits she has an unhealthy boundary with how she feels about my son (she acts as if it’s her child).

She was pregnant and unemployed and, although her husband was working, I make much more money than him and was trying to help. This meant that whenever I went to the grocery store for myself, I'd bring her along and buy all the food for her house. 

After she had the baby and he started in daycare, I started to push for her to get a job and become more financially independent. She finally got a job around 3 months ago and I told her I'd stop paying for her food but I didn't actually follow through on the first two months. I guess I was used to the routine and she was used to getting over 1k in groceries and for free. 

This month I told her I wouldn't be feeding her anymore around the 1st and kept reminding her she needed to buy her own stuff but she kept tagging along whenever I went out (we live in the same apartment building), around two weeks ago I finally put my foot down and stoped buying her stuff and did not bring her with me. At first she kept popping over to my house during mealtimes and eating here (showing up at breakfast and then coming over later at lunch time) and after about a week of this I told her she wasn't welcome during mealtimes anymore. 

Today she sent me a lot of messages saying how hungry she was and how she was crying because of hunger and how she didn't have any food at her place and if I could please give her some things. I know she got paid on Wednesday and I asked her where all her money went and she said 'oh I had some things to pay', after pressing her she said she lent some money to a friend of hers who asked for it and I told her she should have more responsibility with herself and that that was my final answer.

My last post to this subreddit was regarding a driving test, I'm not gonna put it here but it's on my profile for anyone wanting context. Anyways long story short, my parents told me I couldn't do the driving test in their car. So now I'm saving up for my own car and for the driving test itself. 
I managed to get a job as well, started paying rent and such, under the condition people stay out of my room and by extension my trash. (I didn't say trash directly but ffs who digs through trash?)
I've been paying rent. Anyways this all came to a head today, a trash bag of mine was leaking (we leave trash in the garage due to my father taking it to his works dumpster. This means he puts it in his truck bed.) 
The bag that was leaking was in the garage, not in the truck, meaning had I been told about it or seen it myself, I could have pretty easily mopped it up or double bagged the garbage so the small amount of liquid in said bag (old food + etc) would not leak. Instead I found out after taking my trash downstairs, there were a couple recyclable bottles in my trash apparently (I keep the recycling bag next to my trash so it's fairly obvious how that could have occurred) and so when I went downstairs, first thing I saw was that my trash had been dug through (due to the bottles from said trash sitting out). 
When I confronted them about this, they defended their actions by saying they could dig through trash whenever they wanted. So I told them to leave any money I paid for rent on the kitchen table or we would have a problem, if my privacy can't be respected, I may as well not be paying. AITAH? 
also, I did mention the whole mopping it up myself and double bagging it as a solution, as opposed to rooting through garbage, this caused them to yell. AITAH?

I teach high school Spanish, and I plan trips to Spanish-speaking countries every other year for my students. Covid cancelled a couple trips and then I was pregnant, so I had to let another teacher take the kids, but I still helped plan and promote everything. This year I have 30 students planning to go to Costa Rica for a one week trip. This trip has been in the works for over a year. From the beginning of planning my husband said I shouldn't go on the trip. We argued over it multiple times because I really wanted to go. I basically ended up saying I'm planning it and there's no reason I shouldn't go.

Here we are 2 months before the trip and my husband flips every time the trip is discussed. He says I'm being selfish leaving him alone with our son for a week. He feels like it will be too much for him to juggle everything. I always reply that I juggle all the things all the time, and he can handle it. He goes to work at 5am, so I have a nanny planning to come over before he leaves and she will get our son ready and take him to daycare when it opens. I plan to prep all the daycare lunches as much as I can. I'll make it as easy as possible. He says I'm being selfish and our son will suffer without his mom for a week.

Am I the asshole? Is leaving for a week a terrible thing for me to do as a mother? I'm already starting to feel guilty, and getting stressed about leaving, but I think it's mostly due to his constant fights about it. He also keeps threatening to take the whole week off while I'm gone which would use up basically all of his vacation time and we're already paying for daycare so it makes no sense.

But basically, my friend’s sibling texted my sister that I had made my friend cry because my text were “mean”. My main problem is that I cannot tell whether or not my texts were rlly that mean. These were my text “Like ik you probably didnt mean too but like can you just not mention me ever in front of your parents unless they ask about me and I fr don’t want to lose you as a friend overall”. My sister told me I was mean and rude for sending those, my friend’s sister got pissed.

**History on my struggle in school:**  
Here's some more context, I've been struggling in school FOR YEARS, so much so that I had to be moved to a alternate school because the curriculum was going too fast for me to understand and keep up, it was also nearly impossible to ask for help in my old school as there simply wasn't enough time during class and after school for tutoring (not to mention that my classes were really big and I wasn't the only student struggling so I felt bad for being so needy and slow when there were 20 other students needing help.)

**Details at what my parents are mad at + extra things I've done to disappoint them:**   
Anyways my parents got really mad at me for failing a good chunk of my classes like math, biology, physics, and chemistry, and now that I've finally passed all my classes in a setting that was easier they don't wanna go to my graduation because it's revenge for never listening to them to just try harder so that I can pass my classes. I've also done little to no actual providing for my family (like get a job) and I always gave them the excuse that I'm still  in school, and that I didn't know how to actually apply and survive an interview. They called me out for being lazy since one of my friends got a job and was able to manage it, but even after I saw my friend succeed, I've made little to no progress on getting a job... except for trying to apply to pizza hut but never getting a response and not trying trying to reach out. I've also tried asking them to teach me how to drive or help me to get a license which I assumed made their opinion on me worst (since I was asking for things while I couldn't even manage their expectations of me.)

**Acknowledging my short-comings:**   
I know that in a way I've kind of deserved this as I've done nothing particularly worthy for them to be proud off, and I've completely missed their expectations of me, I just still thought they'd just momentarily look past my short comings, be a little proud of me at this one achievement I've gotten, or at least just arrive for the sake of not embarrassing me or our family in front of the school.

Also my friends wanted to be invited and I was really thankful but they cant go because all of them are either in school or at work (they go to different schools, and I told them that it's fine as I don't want them to fail or miss a paycheck!)

I'm openly bi, though I've only dated men previously and tbh I don't think many people in my family really believed I was bi because of that. It is still new and I hadn't officially mentioned her being my GF with the family yet.

Last night, my sister hosted a small engagement party with close friends and family. I was very very enthusiastically encouraged to bring a partner, but given the fact its a girl and would be our first event, I didn't want to make a big deal at the party and came alone.

For the entire time I was there, my mother kept pestering me about finding a boyfriend/husband. I avoided her, trying to dodge her questions, but I'm not a very good lying and she quickly picked up on that fact. So she enlisted the help of my cousin to stalk my Instagram. I don't post much, but they quickly found me tagged in my GFs posts and put two and two together.

It wasn't a \*bad\* reaction, but it was the main topic of conversation for the rest of the night. Lots of whispers, questions and ""Love is love"" comments.

159,1d4lke7,AITA for confiding in the friend of friend? ,"So the past 6 months of friendship with this person has felt... heavy. When we disagree on a subject, she tends to get pretty aggressive with her stance and makes it really uncomfortable to continue the discussion. She also becomes accusatory and insinuates shitty things like racism or bigotry, and shuts down requests to discuss things further in person (disagreements are over text). 

She recently told me about an argument between her and a friend of hers that I'm acquainted with. She spoke about it a bit arrogantly, as if her friend was ""slow"". This frankly ticked me off and this friend is like me, non confrontational and prioritizes a smooth friendship over ""being right"". So, I reached out to this friend to A) check on her... I figured she might have hurt feelings and B) ask if she was having the same experience as I was. I wanted to rule out my friend having some secret resentment... since she didn't seem to care about making things so unpleasant during our discussions. And to be completely honest, wanted to know if my friend spoke about ME in the same arrogant manner to her friend. I did not tell her that my friend expressed frustration or arrogance... just that she told me they had a disagreement. Her friend initially passed on the chance to talk about anything, but called me back and vented for a half hour. (She feels the same as me about how our friend handles differing views)... 

A week later I get a text from my friend saying her friend told her about my call. (Guilty conscience).. How betrayed she feels, how she told me about her friend because she was concerned she had snapped at her (not true, she was annoyed)... and how I put her friend in an unfair position. She ended the decade long friendship right then and there. I'm okay, I'm actually relieved because I felt like I was walking on eggshells with her... but I also want to know... was what I did so wrong? I know it wasn't the right decision to reach out to her friend for clarity, instead of confronting her head on... but I'm trying to understand if it really was a betrayal or just naive? I did apologize profusely and offered a chance to meet in person to explain my actions. She declined and said she wouldn't be comfortable. 

Part of me thinks she doesn't want to face her behavior and how it made her friends feel, shame for her arrogance, part is just being pissed that I went to her friend (she feels exposed, though I did not expose how she spoke about her friend and has spoken about her a few times prior).",Everyone Sucks,2024-05-31,"AITA for confiding in the friend of friend?  So the past 6 months of friendship with this person has felt... heavy. When we disagree on a subject, she tends to get pretty aggressive with her stance and makes it really uncomfortable to continue the discussion. She also becomes accusatory and insinuates shitty things like racism or bigotry, and shuts down requests to discuss things further in person (disagreements are over text). 

She recently told me about an argument between her and a friend of hers that I'm acquainted with. She spoke about it a bit arrogantly, as if her friend was ""slow"". This frankly ticked me off and this friend is like me, non confrontational and prioritizes a smooth friendship over ""being right"". So, I reached out to this friend to A) check on her... I figured she might have hurt feelings and B) ask if she was having the same experience as I was. I wanted to rule out my friend having some secret resentment... since she didn't seem to care about making things so unpleasant during our discussions. And to be completely honest, wanted to know if my friend spoke about ME in the same arrogant manner to her friend. I did not tell her that my friend expressed frustration or arrogance... just that she told me they had a disagreement. Her friend initially passed on the chance to talk about anything, but called me back and vented for a half hour. (She feels the same as me about how our friend handles differing views)... 

A week later I get a text from my friend saying her friend told her about my call. (Guilty conscience).. How betrayed she feels, how she told me about her friend because she was concerned she had snapped at her (not true, she was annoyed)... and how I put her friend in an unfair position. She ended the decade long friendship right then and there. I'm okay, I'm actually relieved because I felt like I was walking on eggshells with her... but I also want to know... was what I did so wrong? I know it wasn't the right decision to reach out to her friend for clarity, instead of confronting her head on... but I'm trying to understand if it really was a betrayal or just naive? I did apologize profusely and offered a chance to meet in person to explain my actions. She declined and said she wouldn't be comfortable.

161,1d4lfov,AITA for telling my SIL she could have gotten her own apartment?,"So, 2 years ago, my husband (Sam, m34) and I (f35) lived with my parents for a year while looking for a house. Meanwhile, Sam’s sister Lucy (f47) moved to our country for a job. The plan was for her husband Tom (51) and son to stay in their home country until Lucy found a house.

Lucy, Sam, and I hung out a lot. Every time, we’d ask, “Hey, how’s the house hunting?” And Lucy would say, “I’m working 12 hours a day—I don’t have time to look. I’m still living in Airbnbs.” “Do you need help?” “Oh no, I’m fine, I’m fine.”

Over the next few weeks, we helped Lucy download house-hunting apps and took her to open houses, but she made 0 offers. By then, I suspected Lucy was hoping we’d offer to let her stay with us until she found a house. But it wasn’t my house, and my parents weren’t offering. Three months passed, and Lucy started saying, “I have to make sure I keep booking this AirBnb on time, or I’ll end up sleeping in my car.” It was winter, so I said, “This isn’t our house, so I can’t let you live here. But if it comes to staying in your car, I bet we can figure something out for a night.” “Oh no, I’m fine, I’m fine.”

A couple weeks later, Lucy called Sam to say that she was staying in a hotel. “Much better than living in my car. Did I mention I’ve been living in my car?”

Um. No?

At this point, Lucy was laughing about the whole thing, so Sam laughed too and shrugged the whole thing off.

Then 2 *more* weeks later, Sam got a text from Tom: “I can’t believe you’re making your sister live in her car. In January. You are a human piece of shit.” Turns out, Lucy had gone back to sleeping in her car. And she’d told Tom that we’d refused to let her stay with us—in a house that isn’t ours—forcing her to live in her car.

I was livid. Never once had she told us she was going to be homeless. Never once had she actually asked for help. And now, she was badmouthing us to Tom, who was badmouthing us to the rest of the family. Everything blew up. This is a tight-knit family, so around 10 people got involved. Lots of accusations, yelling, and harsh texts. I stayed out of it because it’s Sam’s family, not mine—and I was too furious to be reasonable.

Eventually, Sam and Lucy talked it out, and we reentered a state of peace. This was 2 years ago, and no one’s mentioned it since. But here’s where I might be TA. A week ago, Lucy, Sam, and I were laughing about something dumb I said to a friend. I was like, “It’s a miracle he and I are still friends.” And Lucy said, “At least you didn’t make him live in his car. That would really kill things.”

She laughed, I think to try and break the ice on that memory? But in 2 years, she and Tom never apologized for lying about us and calling Sam a POS. So I just said, “You were in your 40s, Lucy. You could’ve gotten a damn apartment.”

162,1d4l8ut,AITA for starting arguments with my mom over hair?,"I (17M) grew up with my hair being a constant point of conflict between me and my mom. Throughout elementary school my mom always did my hair in the morning and I rocked this shaggy shoulder-length long hair that she loved. Eventually in middle school I got tired of it always getting in my eyes since I played basketball for a couple of different teams and decided I wanted it cut short. Truthfully I can’t remember everything that happened but I remember her being hurt and angry that I wanted to cut my hair just because it was getting in my way. 

Eventually though I did cut it short and my mom ended up crying and being disappointed. She made me do my hair every morning and didn’t care if it looked ridiculous. Honestly I think she should have made me do my hair earlier in my life as it’s a basic responsibility, but at the time it seemed like a dig at me showing she didn’t care if I looked stupid or embarrassing. 

Fast forward and I have just finished my junior year in high school. I currently have decently long hair that goes to about the bottom of my ears and I try to style it to give it texture but I have super straight and thin hair. It sometimes looks like a helmet and truthfully I’m not sure I like my hair right now. However I think I look weird having my ears show and I don’t have a big forehead but I also like covering it so it kinda forces this awkward length. Anyways I brought up the idea to my parents of getting a looser perm to give my hair some texturing, while still keeping the length that I liked and I was promptly dismissed.

I brought it up again tonight to my mom and she thought it was a bad idea. She stated I had senior pictures coming up and believes I should wait until after them before doing anything? I didn’t see how that was super relevant and I said no one was going to care what hairstyle I was rocking and she did not like this, thus causing an argument. One of her points in this argument was it would cause damage and it would be expensive - this is where she stated I’d be paying for everything involved in the perm. (for reference my parents have always paid for my haircuts. So this felt like an attempt to discourage me to do it, and I just started working so she knows I could pay for it.) I offered talking to a stylist to find a new look that would  give me more texture or something that wouldn’t be a perm. (Again, another reference; I use texture powder in the morning to give my hair something going on otherwise it would pretty much be a bowl on my head.) She disliked this idea too and said I should still wait for after pictures before doing anything drastic. 

This resulted in more arguing and I said some unkind things I should not have but It felt super controlling that I’m almost 18 and I can’t decide what I want to do with my own hair. Am ITA?

164,1d4kn32,WIBTA for confronting my parents on the way they talk about my little sister in front of me?,"Hey all, maybe this is a stupid post, but it's lingering on my mind and I need to know if I'm being dumb.

I (20F) am an artist by trade and profession. I'm fully disabled, including an unspecified neurological disorder. When we found this out, it shattered my dream of being a tattoo artist. This is what I've wanted to do my whole life. I'm still very broken up about it and it's been years. I've been practicing my craft and I'm definitely a decent artist, there's a market for my work and I make steady enough cash on commissions but not enough to survive.

I have a little sister (18F) who has no interest in art. I won't lie, she's quite talented at realism! 

Every time someone sees my little sister's art, they comment on how amazing it is. My mom and dad always tell her she should be a tattoo artist - and this often happens directly in front of me. They are supportive of me, but they've never shown the same level of respect towards me and my interests. It should be noted that my sister doesn't want to be a tattoo artist, nor is it a career path my parents really want for either of us. They just always tell everyone how perfect she'd be for that job. 

I'm not a jealous person by nature, honestly. I have two siblings and they're so so talented, and I am so proud of them. But it crushes me to know that my parents will talk about how good my sister would be at my dream job that I can't have in front of me. I just wish they were half as proud of me as they are of them, but I know it's not something I'll ever reach. 

I don't want them to not praise her art - they absolutely should! She's so talented! And comments like that are ok, but... would I be the asshole if I asked them really politely to not do it in front of me if they're going to make those comments? It really hurts my feelings.

To clarify, I really have no clue if this is ok or not or if I'm overreacting. I was the only homeschooled kid in the family and I'm debilitatingly autistic, I just don't want to get berated or yelled at if I say something wrong or mess up.

I could also be biased because I have an extremely poor relationship with said younger sister, but I can't decide if that's a factor in how I feel yet.
