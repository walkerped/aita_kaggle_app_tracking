2,1d5qit1,AITA for yelling at my mum for going though all my belongings after I went on holiday for a week,"I (FtM 19) just got back from a 6 day holiday at my grandparents house and upon entering my bedroom found that my mother (59F) went though all of my bedroom drawers and threw stuff away or rearranged them. 

I’m autistic, so people moving my stuff is irritating, not to mention I’d been on a train for around 4 hours returning home.
I’m specifically mad because she chucked away a package I hadn’t opened yet that cost £30, that I had bought for my friend.

I asked her where the package was as she acted like she didn’t have a clue. My mother has a habit of throwing away my stuff and telling me she doesn’t know where it is, only for me to later find out that she chucked it away.

Obviously I was pissed because I’d only been gone a few days, so I started yelling at her. She responded by threatening to call the police on me to which I just went back to my bedroom and cried because I was so overstimulated.

I don’t feel bad for my reaction but she’s acting like it’s the end of the world.

3,1d5g8i7,AITA Monthly Open Forum June 2024: Assholes ASSemble!,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

We’ve been diving into various sub rules lately. So we thought we’d take a break this month, and revisit something we did in an earlier open forum. Hence, the call to ASSemble! (We had a few names that we were throwing around. ASS (Assholes Sharing Stories), Asshole Amnesty Month.

Tell us about a time when you were the asshole. We can relax *some* sub rules a bit (a revenge story is probably fine, since you’re recalling, and not asking for judgment). But, other sub rules still apply (no violent encounters, for example)! Let us know about a time when you knew you were the asshole. Maybe you didn’t mean to be, but after the encounter, you realized you were TA. Or, maybe you knew what you were doing, and went through with it anyway! 

Personally, I've always felt the more low-stakes the issue, the better. Those are always my favorite AITA stories, but feel free to share whatever you may have. And most important - have fun with it!

4,1d5csoh,AITA for yelling at my husband for bringing animals home? ,"My (29F) husband (55M) is the kind of person who grew up in a house with wealthy parents who believed that their luxurious house was no place to keep ""dirty animals"", so he never had a pet until he was at least 27 years old. And since then he loves animals and I love them too and for a while I dedicated myself to helping him foster dogs or cats that he rescued, or that were abandoned at his clinic (he is a veterinarian) but lately I'm feeling overwhelmed, because he brings animals home all the time and I'm already tired of it. 

Last night a person came to his clinic and abandoned a dog and her three puppies and he brought them home, the same house where we already have 6 dogs and 3 cats !!!! I told him we couldn't keep them and he said yes, that these will be the last (he says that all the time) and I lost my composure a little and I yelled at him that I'm tried of him because he always says the same thing, and he said that he is the one who takes care of them and invests money in them and that I'm overreacting. That when I met him he already had many animals and that I shouldn't be surprised that he still has many. 

I didn't tell him anything because unfortunately he's right, when we met he had at least five dogs. So I didn't answer him anything and I was angry for a few hours until he apologized and said that if I don't want them at home he is going to find them a foster family, and of course our children (9M, 8M, 6F, 5F, 3M, 1F) started crying and saying that they want to keep them. 

We live on a farm where we have A LOT of space and having many animals is not a problem, also money is not a problem either so we could keep them if we wanted but I don't know, I personally feel that having so many children and so many animals is sometimes overwhelming but it is not the end of the world either.

5,1d5cqer,WIBTA for asking my out of town friend to not to bring her husband when she comes for my baby shower?,"Some family is throwing me a baby shower next week but it is being held at my house because we have the most space to accommodate guests and parking. The baby shower is ladies only  (my husband will not even be there).

I have a couple of friends who are attending from out of town and have planned to stay over the night before to avoid several hours of driving the day of. 

One of these friends has a husband and one year old. The original plan was for just her to come and stay over the night before, but now she doesn’t want to be away from them for the 24 hours she would be over, so she is talking about bringing them with her. She doesn’t want to bring the baby alone, and she doesn’t want to leave the baby with dad for the weekend. She reluctantly suggested they could get a hotel, but I don’t think they actually will since they quite literally just drained their bank account this week on a huge purchase. If they actually do follow through with a hotel, I know her husband will still want to hang around our house with my friend most of the time outside of the shower itself. My friend knows the shower is ladies only, she says he would just watch the baby elsewhere while the shower is happening. I think she is viewing this as a chance for us all to visit and catch up on utside of the shower, but it will be such a busy weekend with a ton of other people around. This is really not what we have time for that weekend.

I told her in no uncertain terms that I understand if she cannot make it because they have a lot going on, but she is adamant she is coming. 

I have nothing against her husband, but it’s a ladies only event, and my husband and I are already feeling the stress of getting the house and yard party ready without the addition of hosting her husband and baby for the weekend as well while we’re preparing.

I am sympathetic because she is still a new mom, but if she cannot come to the shower without bringing her husband and son over for the whole weekend, I’d rather she sit this one out.

7,1d5cb9a,AITA for embarrassing my cousin and her friend after their ballet preformance?,"So basically, back in January, my cousin had a ballet performance and after it ended my family and her family went to stand by the exit/entrance of the building.

Usually my cousin and I hang out a lot, and we make some racist/sexist jokes about our own race. And I usually have a hard time of talking about something relative or interesting when I meet other people. Like my friend's other friend, for an example.

Anyway, when my cousin came down and met up with my family, her father gave her flowers and she was hanging out with some of her ballet friends. One in particular, I used to be acquaintances with because we used to go to the same High School together.

I assumed her friend also liked the jokes that I say with my cousin, but when I said one about Arabs (me and my cousin are arab) everything was dead silent.

Later when we left and got in her van to go home, I over heard her and her mom arguing (I'm guessing she told her mom about what I said) and then my cousin looked at me and said ""You ruined my night! Thanks a lot!""

When we got to her house, I went to the guest bedroom I was staying in and I couldn't sleep the whole night because I felt bad for saying that.

I still feel bad for saying that infront of her and her friend.

TLDR; Made a joke infront of my cousins friend after their ballet performance thinking her friend would find it funny, but it was dead silence after that.

I now watch my niece fulltime for free(and have since she was 2 months now being 16months). My sister in law (23 female) is fully aware of the trips we have taken to the fertility clinic and the money we have poured into this. I love caring for my niece, even on days when i am sick as a dog she’s my little buddy and sits on her little potty mocking me in the moments i need to spend some extra time in the bathroom till I’m all done. 

I love my sister in law too but she’s not outwardly gracious. Today we were sitting with family (after i had watched her all day from the time she woke up till her mommy got off work) and i was telling my sister in law about a video i saw of this finger painting craft i was going todo with my niece, so monday we’d have a gift for mommy! My sister in law said ‘no she’s not allowed’ and when i asked why not (and not rudely, this infertile auntie is continuously thanking god when i get the best cuddles during nap time from this darling child god and my sister in law let me spend time with lol). My sister in law told me ‘You know IF you ever have a child you’ll understand’. 

I was immediately insulted, embarrassed, and disgusted. I think ‘excuse me?’ Came out of my mouth afterwards. I mean it was just a hand&foot print painting and i was going to let her daughter give it to her as a gift; a time killer during the day for me and babygirl and a keepsake for momma (you know like the ones daycare does for parents)

She literally didn’t respond, a few seconds pass and my niece come up to me with her little Barbie and starts whining and pulling me to her pile of toys and my sister in law (not paying attention to me walking over there with her) says ‘is auntie being mean to you’ my husband chimes in at this point telling her to stop picking on me. 

At some point before we left she did say he was grateful that i watch her daughter for her…. But AITA for being fucking pissed she threw the ‘IF you have a child’ line in my face for asking her why out of all activities i can’t do a finger painting with her daughter. 


*edit to add: would love some ideas on how to handle this relationship, she often down plays my roll and just kinda picks on me in regard to her kid.

My sister in law said ‘no she’s not allowed’ and when i asked why not (and not rudely, this infertile auntie is continuously thanking god when i get the best cuddles during nap time from this darling child god and my sister in law let me spend time with lol). My sister in law told me ‘You know IF you ever have a child you’ll understand’. 

I was immediately insulted, embarrassed, and disgusted. I think ‘excuse me?’ Came out of my mouth afterwards. I mean it was just a hand&foot print painting and i was going to let her daughter give it to her as a gift; a time killer during the day for me and babygirl and a keepsake for momma (you know like the ones daycare does for parents)

She literally didn’t respond, a few seconds pass and my niece come up to me with her little Barbie and starts whining and pulling me to her pile of toys and my sister in law (not paying attention to me walking over there with her) says ‘is auntie being mean to you’ my husband chimes in at this point telling her to stop picking on me. 

At some point before we left she did say he was grateful that i watch her daughter for her…. But AITA for being fucking pissed she threw the ‘IF you have a child’ line in my face for asking her why out of all activities i can’t do a finger painting with her daughter. 


*edit to add: would love some ideas on how to handle this relationship, she often down plays my roll and just kinda picks on me in regard to her kid. I don’t want to undermine her as the parent but a bored toddler is a terrorizing toddler. Help this worn out auntie please!",0.0,-0.0006294169,0,1
10,1d5bh0l,AITA for not cooking after my fiancé defrosted the wrong type of chicken?,"AITA 

EDIT: bcuz I forgot to add this part and a lot of you are tripping out about asking him to help with anything when he gets home from work. The job my fiancé has is very “easy”- (his words not mine) He openly brags about how easy his job is to all his friends & how all he does is drive and give clean uniforms and hand towels. He does not do physical labor. 

I am a SAHM of 3… my fiancé works Monday thru Friday his regular job where he has to go to different restaurants/establishments to drop off things. He’s given free food from said places everyday. (He’s always telling me what he was given for free so I know it’s literally at least 4 out of 5 days he goes to this job.) I barely get to eat during the day bcuz the kids never let me get a minute to myself. As soon as I go to even think about eating one of my kids start crying or needing me. Today I asked him to get a specific type of chicken out of the deep freezer and put it to defrost so I can cook dinner. After about an hour or so of the chicken defrosting I go to the kitchen to see if it’s ready to be seasoned and cooked & it’s the wrong type of chicken. AFTER I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HIM WHICH ONES TO GET OUT. My whole mood is thrown off- I don’t even want to cook anymore & he wants to know why I have an attitude. I just feel like he does certain things on purpose. Weaponized incompetence???? Like why can’t he do anything the right way the first time I ask? Why do I feel like I cant even ask him to do a simple favor like taking specific meat out the freezer without having to hover over him to make sure he’s doing what I actually asked and not what he “thought he heard” 🙄 
Am I the asshole for snapping at him when he tried to act like it was no big deal? To me it is a big deal bcuz it’s EVERY SINGLE TIME I ask him to help me do anything I feel like he purposely does the task wrong 🤦🏻‍♀️

The point of me bringing up that he gets free food all day is bcuz I don’t think he understands how hungry I actually am when he gets home & I actually get a chance to eat bcuz he gets to eat all day at work without kids interrupting his meals. So when I want something specific I want that & that only. So AITA?

For those who will say I could’ve gotten it out myself- yes your right I should’ve gotten it out myself earlier in the day- but it slipped my mind dealing with the kids & I was busy with the kids when I asked him to get the chicken from the freezer. 



UPDATE: I cooked dinner. & took peoples advice on how to speak to him about it. Even tho I have done this before I did it again and used every type of open communication as I could and thought we were moving in a new direction. Our 2 year old nonverbal autistic son is sick right now- another reason I am overwhelmed. And has had a high fever all day I’ve been trying to combat with Tylenol and keeping him hydrated and comfy. I try again to see if I can ask him to do one thing & see if it’ll be done correctly. I asked him to get our sons sippy cup and fill it with some PEDIALYTE while I check him temperature again to see if it’s went down any. As I’m putting our son back in bed with his sippy cup (only the top is see thru) I see milk & I ask him “hey babe what’s in here?” And he says “ensure like you told me to put” so all of yall calling ME the asshole, absolutely not.

11,1d5bbqv,AITA for telling my husband I don't want to go hang out with him and his brother anymore?,"My husband (26M) and I (21F) haven't been married even one year yet. He works long hours Monday-Thursday (construction) and I work scattered 12 hour shifts (hospital).

In the last couple of months, his brother (30M) has called every almost every other day asking to go do something. I'm usually okay with doing stuff with my husband's family because I think it's good to have a healthy relationship with each other's family's.

I rarely go to see my family because they live 30 minutes away and are usually  busy with sports (as that is what we were raised doing during the summer) or taking care of farm animals.

Just within the last month, my husband and his brother have gone out several times (me tagging along half the time) while I've only had my brother (13M) tagging along once. My husband and I have not gone on an actual date with just us in over a month at least.

I was very excited to go out today since I had the day off and my husband was working a shorter day. I got all dressed up in nicer clothes but my husband's brother called just before we left to see if he wanted to go ride dirt bikes.

13,1d5azes,AITAH for beating my brother at a game,"I know this isn't big, but I don't know what to do. My brother and I are quite close and have one thing in common. We both have a love for gaming. We found as a way to get away from it all and just have fun. It would sometimes get emotional and we would only ever have small arguements, but that was it. I am 15 M and he is 14 M. We both got a VR headset each for Christmas and we enjoyed games like Superhot, Bonelab, but most importantly, Gorilla Tag. If you aren't familiar with the game, I'll give a short explanation now. It is a game where you are a gorilla and you use your arms to transport yourself around the maps and play multiple gamemodes like Infection, Hunt, Paintball, or hang out with strangers in Casual. Anyway, recently, I found a parody of the game where it was the same mechanics but its map, characters anf cosmetics are made entirely of LEGO. I thought this was a fun idea, so I downloaded the game. I played the game for a while and my brother saw. He asked me if I was playing Gorilla Tag but I told him I was playing Brick Tag. I asked him if he wanted to join and he said yes. For context, I am better than him at the game and have a better understanding of the games mechanics. We played a few matches in a private code, but whenever I was the tagger I would win quickly. If I wasn't the tagger, I would barely lose. My brother found it unfair but didn't seem too angry so I decided to give him an advantage by only playing with one arm to make it harder for me. But I soon found out that it didn't help him at all and I kept myself away from and never got tagged. After about 10 minutes of not being tagged and my brother chasing me, he took off his headset and sulked in a chair. I asked him what was wrong and he replied saying that he found it unfair that I was so much better than him and did things that he couldn't do. I said that it was just natural for me as I was used to playing at that level. He stayed in the chair sulking and wasn't having it. I decided to go to my room and give him some space. I have no idea what to do because I want to keep playing but I will find the game boring if I played slower.

Then he decided not the vacate the room for the month of April and wasn't giving me proper notice on if and when he will vacate.

When he was vacating the place he was diving the every stuff that we bought together equally even though he doesn't need those. I didn't say anything because he paid for that so he can take those stuff. But if I apply the same logic he is getting angry. Flatmate A used to buy his personal stuff and would add those to split like fruit and snacks. We never would know whether is the fruit his personal purchase or shared purchased .

17,1d5y3eu,AITA For Telling My Brother (16) a Post I saw on Reddit?,"Hi, this happened a few days ago. I (16F) was reading a post by a user on a different subreddit, which I will not be going into much detail about, other than this post had no overly negative things in it. 

I had first told my brother about this post randomly whilst cleaning dishes as it was quiet and I found it slightly awkward (It very often is as me and him do not get along that well, we often have arguments), so to break the silence I went into light details about the post during the time we were washing the dishes and putting them away, he just nodded along and and every so often went “Oh, that’s cool?” Or reacted in that sort of manner, I didn’t pick up on any proper disinterest and I believe the reason for that is because he has always responded that way to me even during topics he finds really interesting.

The main part of the reason I’m asking whether or not I’m the asshole is because later on in the day when I tried to go further into detail about the story, (I have no real reason on why I wanted to continue talking about the post, I just found it as a way to talk to my brother), when I mentioned it again he asked me in a somewhat rude manner to not talk about it, from what I can remember he said “I don’t want to hear it.” I kind of just sighed and didn’t say anything, when we both got outside it was about 5 minutes into this walk when I told him that I really wanted to talk about the post, and that if he didn’t want me to talk about it he could say no, well he didn’t say no, so I took that as he would be fine to listen. So I started to talk about the post again, a little bit more into detail about it this time, in which he was responding in the way he usually does. However, once I had finished, he all the sudden stopped and turned to me and started getting angry at me, telling me that I ignored his wishes to not speak about it and that I shouldn’t have said anything about it, I was truthfully shocked and got angry back, telling him that I told him to tell me again if he didn’t want to listen and that he missed out on that opportunity. He got even more angry at me and eventually walked off back home leaving me with the two of my dogs to walk home. 

When I got home he was still angry at me and he still is, now I think I overstepped a boundary of his that I didn’t know of because of how long he has been angry at me, so AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-01,"AITA For Telling My Brother (16) a Post I saw on Reddit?

So I started to talk about the post again, a little bit more into detail about it this time, in which he was responding in the way he usually does. However, once I had finished, he all the sudden stopped and turned to me and started getting angry at me, telling me that I ignored his wishes to not speak about it and that I shouldn’t have said anything about it, I was truthfully shocked and got angry back, telling him that I told him to tell me again if he didn’t want to listen and that he missed out on that opportunity. He got even more angry at me and eventually walked off back home leaving me with the two of my dogs to walk home. 

When I got home he was still angry at me and he still is, now I think I overstepped a boundary of his that I didn’t know of because of how long he has been angry at me, so AITA?",1.0,0.08257216215133667,0,0

Initially I invited both my brother (23M) and his long term girlfriend of 3 years to our wedding, however my brother broke up with her last month and a couple of days ago he requested me to let him bring another 1+ to my wedding in order to replace his ex that wasn't coming anymore.

I asked him who he was planning to bring and he said that he wanted to bring a guy he met recenly on Grindr with whom he got along great.

The reason I invited my brother's ex was cause she was a long term girlfriend, which obviously isn't the case with this hook up.

23,1d5x8zy,WIBTA for refusing to pay for matching wedding outfits?,"My (23M) sister (26F) is getting married this summer and wants all brothers to wear the same clothes as each other. 

It is a south Asian wedding with three events, so I'm expected to have three different sets of clothes for each one. I feel it is unreasonable to expect me to spend this much on clothes.

They are currently in Pakistan, buying the clothes from there because ""it's cheaper"". For events #1 and #2, they've chosen clothes that cost £150 each. For event #3 they initially wanted to get Asian clothes, but I insisted that they go for normal (western) suits, because at least those I can wear for other things. However, they are now insisting that these suits should be brought from the same shop so that the colours match... I was planning to get a very cheap suit, but they're going to get something more expensive than what I had in mind.

I'm a student in my final year of uni. I work a part time job, and between my student loan and my part time job, I have enough money to pay rent, and have some left over. That said, I usually have no money left at the end of the month. I won't deny that I'm not the best at controlling my spending: whenever I have a depressive ""episode"" of laying in bed most of the day, I end up ordering cheap takeaways instead of cooking (or at least getting a meal deal). I also spend quite a bit on a very niche sport (which I originally started because my mental health nurse told me to try doing sports). It's not great, but I don't think my coping habits are anyone else's business but mine.

However, my sister has previously pointed to that spending to say that I should be saving for her wedding (this was in relation to me saying that I couldn't afford flights if she had a destination wedding, though this didn't happen because she couldn't afford it either). 

My siblings are all older than me so most have full-time jobs. The one who doesn't lives at home so doesn't have the burden of paying £9k a year in rent and bills. If I had more disposable income, I'd be okay with it, but I don't think I'm the asshole for not cutting my spending on the things that make life tolerable.

I’ve been battling a chronic illness for years. I’ve been going to doctors and they still don’t know what’s wrong with me.

We have this other roommate, Lucy, who is mentally ill, narcissistic and involved with some shady people. She makes us really uncomfortable.

Because of my illness, I can’t afford to move out. This is the only place I can afford. Living with my family is not an option for me.

I asked Jessica if she can wait but she said no. She says she’s sick of being my caretaker and that she has her own life to live. She and her boyfriend already made up their minds and don’t want to wait.

26,1d5vq8m,AITA for telling my friend she has no right in my decision after she got mad that I didn’t consult her? ,"I (17F) have been in a friend group since 9th grade, including four other girls and my deskmate who joined last year. This year, we were closer than ever, but I was especially close with my deskmate and two girls, M and B. I was closest to B in the fall and we hung out alone a few times.

The story begins on the last day before Christmas break. Our school planned a field trip, and M organized a Christmas party at her house. Most girls decided not to go on the trip, leaving only me and B. The night before, B told me she wasn’t going. I was mad because I’d be alone and felt she didn’t care about me. I wrote in our group chat, expressing my frustration. B apologized then and at the party, and we moved on.

After Christmas break, I noticed the girls, except M and my deskmate, were cold to me. We planned a spring trip, and B ended up wanting to change rooms because of the December incident, saying she was uncomfortable. I thought we were fine, but she hadn’t mentioned it before.

In January, I planned a Marie Antoinette-themed birthday party, asking everyone to wear light colors. Except for M and my deskmate, the girls showed up wearing black. For M's birthday, the girls went all out with costumes and they bought new clothes and accessories from shein. 

M later confessed that the girls had been talking behind my back, saying I was pushy and selfish. We had a group talk, but they had no examples of my pushiness. I sent a bold message in the group chat, stating I didn’t want to be friends anymore. I remained friends with M and my deskmate, but M hid our friendship from the others. When I confronted M about this, she cut me off.

My deskmate remained friendly with M and one other girl, but they didn’t talk much. During this time, I became close with K and she supported me during everything.

K once ignored M, angering her. K said she didn’t want to talk to M after what she did to me. Around the same time, my mom found out about the situation and texted M as they knew each other well before we fought, but M didn’t reply, instead texting me to not bother her anymore and then blocking me on everything. 

For two months, I didn’t speak to any of them. Recently, M apologized and wanted to be friends again. We talked and decided to move. I knew K wouldn’t agree but thought it was my decision.

K was very mad at me, feeling I should have consulted her. I explained I learned about it the same day and tried to tell her, but she didn’t notice. K said some people don’t get second chances, removed me from social media, and ended our friendship, saying she couldn’t hang out with someone friends with M. She also said M should have apologized to her too.

I told K she wasn’t the one treated badly and I wasn’t obligated to get her advice. She got really mad, said I was stupid, and wished me luck sarcastically, knowing my big goals.
So, AITA for forgiving M and the things I said to K",No A-holes here,2024-06-01,"AITA for telling my friend she has no right in my decision after she got mad that I didn’t consult her?  I (17F) have been in a friend group since 9th grade, including four other girls and my deskmate who joined last year. This year, we were closer than ever, but I was especially close with my deskmate and two girls, M and B. I was closest to B in the fall and we hung out alone a few times.

The story begins on the last day before Christmas break. Our school planned a field trip, and M organized a Christmas party at her house. Most girls decided not to go on the trip, leaving only me and B. The night before, B told me she wasn’t going. I was mad because I’d be alone and felt she didn’t care about me. I wrote in our group chat, expressing my frustration. B apologized then and at the party, and we moved on.

After Christmas break, I noticed the girls, except M and my deskmate, were cold to me. We planned a spring trip, and B ended up wanting to change rooms because of the December incident, saying she was uncomfortable. I thought we were fine, but she hadn’t mentioned it before.

In January, I planned a Marie Antoinette-themed birthday party, asking everyone to wear light colors. Except for M and my deskmate, the girls showed up wearing black. For M's birthday, the girls went all out with costumes and they bought new clothes and accessories from shein. 

M later confessed that the girls had been talking behind my back, saying I was pushy and selfish. We had a group talk, but they had no examples of my pushiness. I sent a bold message in the group chat, stating I didn’t want to be friends anymore. I remained friends with M and my deskmate, but M hid our friendship from the others. When I confronted M about this, she cut me off.

My deskmate remained friendly with M and one other girl, but they didn’t talk much. During this time, I became close with K and she supported me during everything.

K once ignored M, angering her. K said she didn’t want to talk to M after what she did to me. Around the same time, my mom found out about the situation and texted M as they knew each other well before we fought, but M didn’t reply, instead texting me to not bother her anymore and then blocking me on everything.

Recently I had a severe asthma attack due to my allergies, I’ve tried to reason with him to get rid of the additional cats and go back to the original 3 that were at the apartment when I chose to move in with him. he argues that it is my fault and I shouldn’t have moved in knowing I had a cat allergy. but mind you he had 3 cats at the start (I could handle the 3 not 7…) the additional 4 have made my allergies and asthma unbearable. Hes suppose to be my “bestfriend” and claims he cares for my health.. he had the audacity to ask me what was wrong when I was having an asthma attack due to the cat sanctuary he has made our small 1 and 1/2 bedroom apartment. whenever I bring up the additional cats he becomes instantly defensive even though I’m only bringing it up due to my own health. I don’t understand why he won’t reason with me and go back to the original 3. Is there something I’m missing??? is 7 cats in a small 1 and 1/2 apartment really not an issue?

But then, when it came to her hen do, I wasnt invited (it was more organised by her maid of honor, my other sister (18) Bia) and already felt left out. Then at the hen do Bia and another sister (34), Charlie got to find out the name ,but i didnt get told. I asked her a few days after if they already have a name, and my sister said yes, but didnt want anybody to know. When i then pointed it out to her that Bia and Charlie did know though, she said that it was and accident. 

Now shes about to give birth and sent everybody a message that she doesn't want anybody there for atleast two weeks and if we do come, she put up (pretty reasonable) rules for it. But then today, Bia told me that she and Charlie were allowed to be there almost imitietly after the birth. I understand it for Charlie, because she already is a mother and this is Anna's first child, but Bia? She is only one year older than me and isnt a godparent. I feel very upset that im being left out like this, because appointing me the godparent, made me think that I was given a special role in the life of the child, not Bia 

I first didnt mentioned it our family,  because i feel like that is something the parents probably want to announce themselfs but then we once talked about it at the diner table, and when Bia said that she is expected earlier, I mentioned that i would probably also be there earlier, Bia whispered under her breath, that that wont happen and i just snapped and said that yes it would, because I am the godparent. We didnt talk about it anymore since then,but did I just steal something from Anna and her husband that was theirs right to share? The difficult thing is just that they also said they dont want to baptise their child, which i dont have any problem with, but is my role as a godparent then even real? I always thought that godparents had something to do with baptism. That, and the fact that Anna hasnt really told me anything about the baby make me feel like she maybe didnt actually meant it, with asking me to a godparent.

 We also havent been in that much contact recently on either sides (for me because of exams) but to you think she would have let me be a bigger part if wed been in better contact? She definitely texts more with Bia and the fact that she is her maid of honor might be the reason that Bia is more up to date with the pregnancy than me, but to put me in the visitor time with everyone else feels like im being left out of something, a godparent is supposed to be a part of. I thought about confronting  Anna, but she about to give birth and i dont want to upset her.

This is important because Saturdays we go to the supermarket and pay the bills together.

I went and he was there, I tried to hand to him the card, he said he already payed for me and to go home. Basically he told me to go away.

I went home on my own. He still doesn't want to talk to me. I realize it was my fault and that it's sad to wake up alone with not even a good morning text. But I also think he's being unreasonable.

34,1d5v6mn,AITA for yelling at my friend in class?,"AITA for yelling at my friend in class?

Okay, to set the scene, I (17f) and my friend (17f) are juniors in hs and we share an english class. Our last assignment was to read two paragraphs, then write the essay in parts. We had three class periods to finish it. The first period, we focused mostly on the beginning of the essay. My friend is not the best when it comes to writing (she even says this herself), so she spent most of the time asking me questions instead of writing, and because we had to turn in our papers at the end of class (my teacher is very scared of AI) she ended up just copying everything I had (3 paragraphs). I was really annoyed by this and tbh I fought her a little about giving her my paper, but I didn’t want to get a bad participation grade, so..

The next class, she did the same thing asking me questions (some of which scared me bc we’re in an AH class and we’re juniors, they were just so dumb) and doing nothing. With like 20 minutes left in the class, she asked to see my paper and I said no. She asked why not and I told her because we were supposed to do this as a team and she wasn’t contributing anything. She told she wrote the rebuttal and I asked to see and I swear it was so bad. I didn’t tell her that though, I just said you’ve written one paragraph compared to me writing 4 - that’s not teamwork. She told me that’s not fair because she’s not “english brained” like me. I didn’t respond to her and finished editing my paragraphs.

That third class I was debating skipping, but I didn’t. (I should’ve) I made up in my mind that as long as she decided to turn over a new leaf and actually do something, I’d work with her. My teacher handed us our papers back and I noticed on the first page I misspelled a word. I erased it, changed it, and when I looked up, she was staring at me. She said something like, “I can’t believe your so petty that you’d change things just to spite me.” I asked what the fuck she was talking about and she started acting our grade, calling me names, saying I’m a baby for not working with her (what.), and claiming that I “changed the whole paragraph just now.” I was really fed up, because its been three days and why are we acting like this at 17. I told her to stop yelling at me because I’m right in front of her; then, for the 18706th time, I explained to her that teamwork means we do the work evenly to reach an end goal and that has not happened once in the past few days. I also told her that all I did to my paper was fix one word. I think she tried to say something after, but I just grabbed my stuff and walked out the classroom. I did get in trouble, but I talked to my teacher and she got my lunch detention excused. 

I haven’t talked to her since then, but she’s trying to be friendly with me. Especially because she told a mutual friend (who apparently doesn’t like her either) about the argument, but lied about things I said.

",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-01,"AITA for yelling at my friend in class? AITA for yelling at my friend in class?

Okay, to set the scene, I (17f) and my friend (17f) are juniors in hs and we share an english class. Our last assignment was to read two paragraphs, then write the essay in parts. We had three class periods to finish it. The first period, we focused mostly on the beginning of the essay. My friend is not the best when it comes to writing (she even says this herself), so she spent most of the time asking me questions instead of writing, and because we had to turn in our papers at the end of class (my teacher is very scared of AI) she ended up just copying everything I had (3 paragraphs). I was really annoyed by this and tbh I fought her a little about giving her my paper, but I didn’t want to get a bad participation grade, so..

The next class, she did the same thing asking me questions (some of which scared me bc we’re in an AH class and we’re juniors, they were just so dumb) and doing nothing. With like 20 minutes left in the class, she asked to see my paper and I said no. She asked why not and I told her because we were supposed to do this as a team and she wasn’t contributing anything. She told she wrote the rebuttal and I asked to see and I swear it was so bad. I didn’t tell her that though, I just said you’ve written one paragraph compared to me writing 4 - that’s not teamwork.

I’ve been busting my ass at work, and I was really looking forward to kicking back and relaxing. I’m usually more of a hippy, camping trip and cannabis type of person, but my cousin Jay convinced me we should go to a strip club. I told him okay and that I would cover everyone’s entry and one drink, as the host.

Anyway, I assumed we were going to the one decent club in my town. However, I jump in his hoopty ass car and he starts taking us to the sketchy club by Circle K. There are two problems here. 1 is that he said he’d pick me up in his dad’s car, as his car is shitty and breaks down every five minutes. 2 He’s taking me to the club he knows I won’t go to.

I decide to let the car issue go, as I’m a pretty calm guy and like to go with the flow. However, I just didn’t really want to spend my birthday at this hanky club full of old weirdos. So I told him to pull up to Circle K, I got myself a coke slushy and a little drink to mix in, and I told him to take me home. Jay started being a dick about it, so I told him to forget it and called a ride share.

Basically, this drama ate up most of my birthday evening, but I was just gonna let it go. However, he’s been telling an exaggerated version of the story to friends and family that just makes me look like an ungrateful asshole.

We aren't poor but we do have to budget for things that we want, although technically we are considered low income. My boyfriend works in retail and I work as a hairdresser, both of which are not super high paying jobs.

My sister ""Emily"" (F32) and I have not been super close, and to be honest I do not really like her. I feel like she just takes and does not give, and is condescending towards me. She and her husband are both full-time nurses and they have 2 kids ages 4 and 7.

I know that nurses don't make crazy salaries but Emily and her husband definitely don't earn peanuts. Neither of them have school debt either, as they both had scholarships.

For her entire adult life, Emily has been very irresponsible with money. She always needs new, flashy things and would constantly ask our parents for money.

She and her husband both have fancy range rover cars, wear mostly designer clothes and are often eating at expensive restaurants. I do not know how much of this is being funded by themselves or my parents, but I know my parents give them money every month to ""help with the kids' expenses"".

She recently admitted to me that she has run up a lot of credit card debt, and frequently complains that our parents do not give them enough money. I became frustrated hearing the constant complaining and I told Emily I don't really want to hear about it when I do not get given anything by our parents and she is living a much better lifestyle than most people. I said that if she wants to pay off her debts she should start by cutting back on luxuries.

She got really defensive and said that she works very hard and deserves to have nice things. I explained that I know she works hard but she is quite literally living beyond her means. 

This blew up into an argument as Emily said it's not my job to police her choices and I'm just jealous of her, to which I said I'm not jealous of someone who is in debt and I don't want to hear about her problems that she could've easily avoided. She said I just don't understand how hard life has been for her.

For context, Me F moved to a new city and met this girl we’ll call Sophia. A bit later through the same girl, I met my other friend, Maria. Sophia had this dating phase, I heard allot of names over the period but who stuck with us was my now boyfriend, Alex. He and Sophia broke it off after some time but I stayed in touch with him as I was forward to learning new friends since Sophia and Maria were my only one at the moment. After a few months that I had this friend group, me and Alex started dating and are now in for 9 Months. After we started dating, I noticed the strange behaviour in Sophia, she started declining our requests to hangout and basically distanced herself from us for a while up until now. My boyfriend had to move away so every time he came over, he stayed for a few weeks and it was upsetting to us that Sophia didn’t want to hang around. At one point it was under stable as she had a boyfriend of her own and over the course we became close with Maria and my boyfriends best friend, Pascal. So eventually Sophia and her boyfriend broke it off and she sent into the friend group her “Apology”. Long story short, she didn’t apologise and instead talked about how this and that came to that, so the conclusion was her still having feelings for my boyfriend.

After that Maria and Sophia started acting completely out of character, always calling and texting Alex if something happened, instead of me and it got to the point that I got “updated” of one of the most important things in my friends life’s only through my bf after he accidentally mentioned it. Obviously it started to get to me and I was often livid at them. Here’s maybe where it’s my fault, as I never said anything about it to my friends.

He told me to call my friends and hang out with them and as usual they declined although I don’t call out for them often. But when my bf calls them, they are in less than ten minutes at our doorstep.

It was eating me mentally, I had problems with my mother and work so the neglect of my only girl friends started to eat me alive, and it only got worse for me. My boyfriend, currently the only person I talked to had caught up on this whole situation especially when I started to talk about it more often to him. My bf got fed up since he didn’t like the personality changes and the way they were treating me so he cut them off completely, no contact at all.

Suddenly Sophia and Maria jumped to me talking about my bf and the sudden stop of the friendship without any further explanation. I told them I didn’t know the reason and they got mad, calling me toxic and not a real friend.

41,1d5u0m4,AITA for potentially losing my relationship ," So basically I (22M) have been long distance dating my girlfriend (22F) for just a little over 2 years. The long distance never bothered me because it didn't cost either of us a penny for travel and we saw each other every 2 to 3 weeks she did live like two states away. Either way that's really besides the point but as of recently she just got a job near my area and I just finished school not long ago. Obviously while we were dating the plan was to eventually move in together like all couples but I'm really starting to second guess myself but I want to get the opinion of you all because I don't want this to be a mistake that I regret for the rest of my life. We both have entry level jobs so we don't make a whole ton of money and the more that I think about paying $600 plus for just rent alone in the same city that my parents live in sounds crazier and crazier to me everyday. Deep down I think my gut is saying to focus on myself and live with my parents for two years which would put me ahead in life. Another part of me is saying hey it's time to grow up and join the real world and this is just what happens. Time is running out because she wants to move all her stuff up here but I'm just kind of here like no no no because if she does that then I will feel like I have to live with her and If I do that then I will probably just end up marrying her and I just don't know if I can commit to something like that at the ripe age of 22. She's a wonderful pretty girl so there is 100% parts of me that don't want to let her go but at the same time I feel like I have to do what's best for my future and just time to let that part of my life go. I also owe it to her to let her know that hey I want to do what best for me and so that she can continue her life and move on. My current lease doesn't end till August so I keep using that as a barrier like ""hey we can talk about moving in potentially but my hands are tied until August. Another thing to keep in mind is that she has a couple items here that can be easily transferred into a car and if she brings anymore things down it won't all fit in a car so I really really don't want her to move her entire life down here and then be like hey sorry we are breaking up so that's why I feel like this is a ticking time bomb. I know also when I say that it sounds like I don't want to be with her but I do. Like I said earlier she's a fantastic significant other and we get along so well and I enjoy hanging out with her. I just don't know if I want to be with this girl for the rest of my life. Another thing to note is that she did cheat on me with her ex couple months ago and we have been doing decent. I feel like I should have dumped then but the circumstances weren't right for it but I still feel like it gave me a permanent get out of jail free card meaning I can break it off with her at anytime and not have a “specific” reason. It's definitely not what you want but fuck it happened and this is the life I'm living right now",Not the A-hole,2024-06-01,"AITA for potentially losing my relationship   So basically I (22M) have been long distance dating my girlfriend (22F) for just a little over 2 years. The long distance never bothered me because it didn't cost either of us a penny for travel and we saw each other every 2 to 3 weeks she did live like two states away. Either way that's really besides the point but as of recently she just got a job near my area and I just finished school not long ago. Obviously while we were dating the plan was to eventually move in together like all couples but I'm really starting to second guess myself but I want to get the opinion of you all because I don't want this to be a mistake that I regret for the rest of my life. We both have entry level jobs so we don't make a whole ton of money and the more that I think about paying $600 plus for just rent alone in the same city that my parents live in sounds crazier and crazier to me everyday. Deep down I think my gut is saying to focus on myself and live with my parents for two years which would put me ahead in life. Another part of me is saying hey it's time to grow up and join the real world and this is just what happens. Time is running out because she wants to move all her stuff up here but I'm just kind of here like no no no because if she does that then I will feel like I have to live with her and If I do that then I will probably just end up marrying her and I just don't know if I can commit to something like that at the ripe age of 22. She's a wonderful pretty girl so there is 100% parts of me that don't want to let her go but at the same time I feel like I have to do what's best for my future and just time to let that part of my life go. I also owe it to her to let her know that hey I want to do what best for me and so that she can continue her life and move on. My current lease doesn't end till August so I keep using that as a barrier like ""hey we can talk about moving in potentially but my hands are tied until August. Another thing to keep in mind is that she has a couple items here that can be easily transferred into a car and if she brings anymore things down it won't all fit in a car so I really really don't want her to move her entire life down here and then be like hey sorry we are breaking up so that's why I feel like this is a ticking time bomb. I know also when I say that it sounds like I don't want to be with her but I do. Like I said earlier she's a fantastic significant other and we get along so well and I enjoy hanging out with her. I just don't know if I want to be with this girl for the rest of my life. Another thing to note is that she did cheat on me with her ex couple months ago and we have been doing decent.

we went on a trip with a group of people earlier this year and she treated me as if i was just there to hold her bags and for her to have someone to vent to. the last time we hung out we only hung out because she was upset and she was either on her phone are literally asleep. we barely talked and i basically just watched the movie by myself and then left.

44,1d5tuhz,AITA For Leaving My Husband At Home With Our Kids After He Blew Off Our Anniversary?,"I (37F) am married tro (38M). Our ten year anniversary was last Friday. I took the day off of work to hopefully spend time with him, but it didn't happen. I knew my husband had the day off too, since he had taken call the day before. 

On our anniversary, when I woke up, I saw my gift on my end table. It wasn't wrapped, but I really did like the gift, so I didn't take issue. After I dropped our kids (8M, 7F) off at the bus stop, I went home and made him breakfast. I brought it to him in bed, and he was still sleeping. No problem, I just ate it. My husband woke up at around 9, said ""Happy Anniversary,"" went downstairs, and made himself breakfast. 

I asked if he had any plans for the day, and he said ""To relax."" I wanted to maybe go to a restaurant, or see a movie,  or at least do something together, just me and him, and he said no. By then, I was a bit disheartened but I took his answer. About 20 mins later, I just dress up and head out with a warning about right then. I just treated myself to the spa, shopping, and stuff like that. 

When I got back (6 ish), he was with our kids and by the time they went to bed, he brought up the fact that I left, and asked why I did so. I told him it was because I wasn't just going to do nothing all day because he wanted to, and that he didn't even care enough to spend time WITH me, so it wouldn't be an issue that I spent time alone. 

He went quiet after that, and while we've talked over it since then, I'm posting here to see if my past actions were asshole-like or not.

45,1d5tm1g,AITA for giving my former personal trainer money after my husband said not to?,"In 2022, I (29F) worked with a virtual\* personal trainer (27M) for several months. Things fizzled out when I realized I'd plateau'd and didn't really have time to continue training. He also had some stuff going on in his personal life that prevented him from being able to coach me regularly. So, I stopped working with him. No hard feelings!

Well, earlier this year, this personal trainer contacted me out of the blue asking me for financial assistance because he was in a rough place (he detailed what was going on and it was just an all around unfortunate situation). I called my husband and told him about it, and he told me not to give him any money. After we got off the phone, I considered the situation, and then decided to give him money **one time**, but explained that **I would not be able to do it again**. My former trainer said he understood and thanked me sincerely for the one time gift. It's been months and I haven't heard from him since then. While this trainer and I weren't super close, we'd worked together (virtually) long enough for me to know a little about his life. I gave him money because I honestly just felt sorry for him. He *never* flirted with me, and there was never anything but platonic energy both ways.

Recently, I mentioned in casual passing that I gave my former trainer money and... my husband went ballistic. We have always had separate bank accounts and I have never told him what to do/not do with his own money, so I've truly never felt like I had to get ""permission"" to spend mine. In my view, I just helped someone out who was in need. I do this all the time with homeless people too, even when my husband says don't bother. I'm just really struggling to understand *why* he's so upset. We've been married for 5 years, and have never had jealousy/trust/cheating issues, and when I was training with this person I was always really transparent with him. Heck, I even invited my husband to come along and join me for some sessions! (He never did).

AITA? Or am I missing something?

  
**Edit: A lot of people have asked, so I'll add-**-**I gave a one-time ""gift"" of $150, the equivalent of two sessions. Also, when I say ""virtual training"" I mean that he would FaceTime me and I'd set my phone up in my little apartment gym.

For every movie night, everyone suggests a movie and we all vote which one to watch. There’s this one girl called Delaney who is sensitive to a lot of topics.

There have been a countless number of times where the rest of us decide on a movie only for her to say that we can’t watch it because it upsets her.

I suggested that we should pick the movie we all voted for, and if it’s too much for Delaney, she could skip movie night and stay home. She refused, saying she didn’t want to be left out. She said that if one of us is disturbed by a movie, then the rest of us should respect our friend’s wishes.

49,1d5t1f8,AITA for preferring to go out to a party with another group of friends instead of going out with my main group of friends?,"I (20F) have a little “main"" group of friends (20 F) We had been invited to a pool party with other friends/knowns from the same university where more people we don't know would go. My friends didn't want to go to that party because they wouldn’t feel comfortable and they didn't want to be with unknown people but they still wanted to go out somewhere so they planned to go to my friend ""A"" house

I told them to go to the pool party to do something different But they didn't want to go. However another friend “B” also wanted to go to the party (B it's not from my main group of friends but we still get along). Then one of my friends C"", told me ""Well, if you two (B and I) want to go to that party, go and we'll go to A's house"" So we did that.

While they were at A's house, they uploaded stories of how they were having a good time and so on. Likewise my friend B and I, at the pool party we uploaded stories of how we were having a good time. My friend A replied to one of my stories ""You preferred to go out with them than with us.""

My main group of friends got mad at me. I knew they were going to get angry but I didn't think they would take it so seriously. My friend C also sent me messages saying they wouldn’t talk to me anymore and that I wasn't a true friend because I preferred to go to a different place with ""people I didn't even know"". She also said that I had excluded them from my plans (I literally invited them to the party but I wasn't going to force them to go either). Now they even post hints such as ""it's good that they exclude you from something, it makes you see that it's not your place"" or ""normalize hating attitudes of your friends"".

It hurts me that they reacted that way being that there were other times where we made plans and if any of them didn't want to go we didn't get angry with her at this level, which makes me think that it was not so much the action I did but that they already had problems with me and they were just looking for any moment when I did something to get away from me.

As I said, I knew they were going to get angry, but I didn't know it was going to be so serious as to post hints abt me, talk to me condescendingly and stop talking completely to me since we had never fought this way. I thought they would understand that I can make my decisions about where to go depending on where I feel most comfortable.

Maybe I'm victimizing myself and I should have insisted more to go to the pool party with all of them or I should have adapted to what they wanted and even though I didn't want to go to A's house, go with them so they wouldn't get mad at me. Maybe they are right and it's true that if I didn't prefer to go with them, it's because they're not my real friends. Was I a bad friend for once preferring to go somewhere else with other friends?

Now they even post hints such as ""it's good that they exclude you from something, it makes you see that it's not your place"" or ""normalize hating attitudes of your friends"".

It hurts me that they reacted that way being that there were other times where we made plans and if any of them didn't want to go we didn't get angry with her at this level, which makes me think that it was not so much the action I did but that they already had problems with me and they were just looking for any moment when I did something to get away from me.

As I said, I knew they were going to get angry, but I didn't know it was going to be so serious as to post hints abt me, talk to me condescendingly and stop talking completely to me since we had never fought this way. I thought they would understand that I can make my decisions about where to go depending on where I feel most comfortable.

Maybe I'm victimizing myself and I should have insisted more to go to the pool party with all of them or I should have adapted to what they wanted and even though I didn't want to go to A's house, go with them so they wouldn't get mad at me. Maybe they are right and it's true that if I didn't prefer to go with them, it's because they're not my real friends. Was I a bad friend for once preferring to go somewhere else with other friends? Are they overreacting? ",0.0,0.049314409494400024,0,1
50,1d5sycg,AITA for refusing to share my pen name with my family?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I (F32) wrote a book during Covid that ultimately got published, and is doing okay. Nothing life-changing monetarily, I won't be quitting my day job, but it's something I'm proud of that I never thought I'd accomplish. I published the book under a pen name. My fiancé, his mom, and my best friend have all read the book with my permission, but no one else knows it's my work.

My family (parents and older brother) know that I published a book, but I have not shared the title or my pen name with them. They've pushed for the information, but I told them I want to keep it a secret in case I want to write more books under that name. I told them I want to be able to write without thinking ""what will Mom think when she reads xyz?"" They never truly accepted this, and it comes up at every family event.

Recently we were together for dinner, and the topic came up again. I wasn't in the best mood and we'd all had a couple drinks, and my brother had been acting like an ass because his wife wasn't there to reign him in. I admitted that the real reason why I wouldn't let them read my book was because, when I first tried keeping a diary when I was 6 or 7, my brother (then 9 or 10) would search my room for my diary, find it, and read it. He would mock me for what I'd written. If his name was mentioned, he would get a black marker and scribble it out. When I went to my parents in tears, they told me it was my fault for writing about him, and he had a right to read it. They did buy me one of those diaries with a lock for Christmas that year, but then he'd just pick the lock or I'd catch him prying the book open, and he'd never even get reprimanded. I was treated like a nuisance and a tattletale for bringing it to their attention because he was their precious firstborn prince. He would be emboldened and would continue to torment me. I stopped keeping diaries because it wasn't worth giving him ammunition.

They blew up when I revealed this and told me I was being a baby and needed to get over it, and it never even was a big deal. I told them that it basically gave me a complex where I'm overly protective of my writing, and I have a hard time sharing it because I feel like I'm going to be mocked and ridiculed for it. They told me I was being so dramatic and that I always do this. AITA for refusing to share my pen name with them?

Edit to add: Thank you for the kind comments. Some people have asked for the title of my book, but I really don't feel comfortable doing so, especially since this has gotten way more attention than I anticipated.

52,1d5srv8,AITA for expecting my brother to pitch in when visiting?,"Hi there, need some serious input on the situation. I (26) male moved to another country with my girlfriend 2 years ago. We built a life for ourselves basically from nothing. We both have stable income that lets us rent a nice apartment and take vacation once a year. My whole family lives in another country that is very far away (about 9 hrs flight). I haven’t seen them since I left and obviously miss them a lot. I have 2 siblings while my girlfriend is the only child. 
My younger brother (21) is coming over to visit. We discussed that he will visit, but he never elaborated on his plans while he is here. I reiterated multiple times that I want to discuss dates etc prior to him buying tickets. I learned today that he bought the tickets. The last date of his stay is the day prior to our vacation. I said that I feel bad that he didn’t talk it over with me since I wouldn’t be able to drop him off due to work. Throughout the conversation it came up that he spent all of his money on tickets and when I mentioned pitching in for food, he hung up. 
Context: my brother works full time job remotely and will be working all of his time visiting. He will be visiting for a month. 
AITA for assuming he would pay for his own food? I wouldn’t obviously charge him for rent/utilities but city where I live is expensive and I was getting ready for our vacation that will cost a lot too. When my girlfriend’s family visited us they bought their food, but they are grown adults so I don’t expect the same from my brother. 
But now I’m concerned since what is he wants to visit some tourist attractions or if my girlfriend and I go the restaurant, how would I leave him at home? Obviously not, so I’ll have to pay. I feel like a horrible person but at the same time I never expect anyone to pay for me. AITA?

53,1d5s91f,AITA for using the disabled toilets when I feel I am entitled to do so?,"EDIT: I realised I have omitted an important detail that being even if IBS (which i personally consider a disability) some people do not consider it a disability however I also suffer with myotonic dystrophy which in the UK at least is a recognised disability therefore when using disabled toilets I feel justified using them. That is all


I will accept before this post that I am intoxicated but it is important to the situation and it could affect my emotions however bear in mind I do have a good grasp of my emotions even when intoxicated. 

So this happened today and it was a celebration for my friends 22nd birthday and we decided to do a Pub crawl for a celebration. For important info is that I have IBS so when I drink I Rarely can be triggered by it. I take medication to try and reduce my symptoms so I can’t gauruntee that my medication is 100% effective.

Anyways yeah I go out for a pub crawl for my mates birthday so naturally we start drinking alcohol and I start needing to use the toilets and I decide due to my ibs and several other underlying I am entitled to use the disabled toilets which also acts as a baby change.

Anyways I go to use the toilets and I am in there for 10-15 mins at max at least. Some woman comes to the door and starts getting impatient. It gets to the point where she gets a staff member to open the door so she can go In so I have to shout that the toilet is occupied just so the door doesn’t open again (for clarity the door did open whilst I was still using the toilet).

I respect the woman needs to use the baby change and respect the baby has needs I should respect however I also have needs that should be respected too. So after what happened and they say maybe I should have just used the normal toilets. While that is viable and the disabled toilets were closer (disabled downstairs and right next to me normal upstairs) I feel like I have a right to use them unjudged and undisturbed. AITA

54,1d5s7xm,AITA for not paying my friend back for drinks?,"After a gruelling 4 years in college, my friend group decided to throw a huge party last month for graduation. I offered to host, as my house has the most amount of space.
 
In total, there were 6 of us planning the event and we agreed to split costs equally. Each person was given a budget and told to buy what the felt was needed for their category (food, desserts, soft drinks, etc). Me and a friend, Kaitlyn, go shopping together the weekend before. I buy the stuff for the category I was assigned, desserts, as well as some cupcakes for myself because I really like them. Everything is on the same receipt.

We hashed out bills the following weekend before we started cooking anything and everything seemed to go smoothly. As I'm prepping food in the kitchen, Kaitlyn and another friend, Ashley, come up and accuse me of adding onto the total for my section in order to pocket more cash. I'm not mad, I see how things may have been misconstrued, as Kaitlyn watched me purchase the cupcakes, but I had taken the cost ($5 roughly when rounding up) out of the total to be split.

The issue escalates and they demand I show my receipts to the group. I think they were betting on me not having them, but Walmart keeps receipts in-app so I had proof. No one else but Kaitlyn and Ashley seemed to really care, and I had proved my innocence so we dropped the matter.

The real issue arose the day of the party. We had our own personal pre-game session about an hour or two before letting guests over. Nothing crazy, two, 750 ml bottles of Amsterdam and Svedka. Kaitlyn had bought the drinks. The day after the party, she sends a text saying we owe her $9 each for the pregame bottles. 

You know, I wasn't a math major, but I'm damn sure a fifth of New Amsterdam and flavored Svedka doesn't cost $54 fucking dollars. I raise the issue in the chat and no one says anything. Ashley messages me privately and says I'm being cheap and that I should just pay Kait back. 

I ignore the message and text the other girls. Turns out, they paid Kait back before I questioned the amount. They thought it was weird she would lie about the price, but they're the type of people that don't go looking for money after it's already left their account. 

I text Kait privately with images of the online prices of the bottles and a question mark (should be $24-$30 total, max). For context, there is only one store in our state licensed to sell liquor. She says the bottles were more expensive in store. Even if I believed that, why would they be over DOUBLE the online price? I refused to pay her back at all. 

Kait and Ashley are talking shit behind my back, calling me broke and referencing both this, and the cupcake incident that happened prior. The rest of the group is on my side somewhat, but a few of them think it's wrong that I didn't pay her back based on the online totals for the bottles. I figure the $9 the 4 of them paid more than covers what Kait is owed, and am not giving her jack. Am I the asshole?

58,1d5qodk,WIBTA for not paying my mom because I gained weight?,"For the sake of being anonymous, I'll be vague with some of the details.

I am an adult woman (<30) living with my parents. My current job will not allow me to live on my own comfortably in my state, and I'm waiting until I advance in my field before I'm able to move away.

I'll be blunt about this: I am not at a healthy weight. It hasn't been good for my health, and I've had many health scares. In February of this year in particular, my body was in a lot of pain, and my heart wasn't doing so well. I've had an unhealthy relationship with food due to some pretty serious trauma all my life. I eat when I'm stressed or scared.

My mother made it clear that something needed to be done. She was right. Otherwise, in her words, ""you won't be able to bear children at your weight, and you won't be healthy or comfortable in life."" These are all true. I've always wanted to be a mother and I want to live life without discomfort, but I think my mom just wants grandkids.

Fast forward to May, and I'm down \~20lbs! I feel really confident, my clothes are fitting or loose, and my body is thanking me. It hasn't been easy, and I've relapsed many times over three months. I'm still not at a healthy weight, but I am proud of my progress. My mother weighs me every end of the week. She flips from being really proud of the loss, to really disappointed with the gains when they happen.

My mother has stated ""let's kick it up a notch"" with my weight loss. As proud of me as she was, she knows I can do better. So, to add more of an ""incentive"" she said earlier last month, ""For every week you relapse/gain weight--even if it's one pound--you have to give me $100."" I didn't want to. Sure, the money I have is alright for what I am and what I do, but with other obligations I have (car payments, food, student loan payments resuming, contributing to the house, misc.), I was scared of losing more money. If I gained weight every week for a month, that's $400, which is a double-digit percentage of my monthly salary. I won't be able to save as much as I did before.

Last week, I did okay. In the beginning of the week, my mother approached me and said, ""So, am I getting my $100 this week?"" I was scared. But, I lost 4lbs, putting me just above the 20lb mark. I was so happy. 

This last week was a relapse for me. I ate out of stress and gained back 2.5lbs. Mother noticed and said ""welp, that's 100 for me!"" I gave her the money in frustration, and it hurt me. I was discouraged. All that progress seemed gone for me, all because I gained a few pounds. The following day, I stepped on the scale, and I weighed less than I did the previous week. I was so angry.

I don't want to give her money anymore, and I feel that this is some sort of abuse, or taking advantage of me. But, at the same time, I know I need to be healthy, and maybe my mom is onto something making me lose money so it hurts. I'm scared to approach others because of this because they are likely to side with her. WIBTA if I didn't agree to this anymore? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-01,"WIBTA for not paying my mom because I gained weight? For the sake of being anonymous, I'll be vague with some of the details.

I am an adult woman (<30) living with my parents. My current job will not allow me to live on my own comfortably in my state, and I'm waiting until I advance in my field before I'm able to move away.

I'll be blunt about this: I am not at a healthy weight. It hasn't been good for my health, and I've had many health scares. In February of this year in particular, my body was in a lot of pain, and my heart wasn't doing so well. I've had an unhealthy relationship with food due to some pretty serious trauma all my life.

59,1d5qb1x,AITA for not giving someone else a free bag of food I had just been gifted ,"Me and my boyfriend were sat on a bench in our university campus, a couple of bakery workers came up to us and explained they were closing and did we want some of the left over food for free. If you're in the UK and familiar with the ""too good to go"" scheme then I believe it was a part of that and the bag just hadn't been claimed *(more context below).* Ofcourse being given free food in this economy felt like we had hit the jackpot and in the bag was around 3 pastry items and 3/4 sandwiches, we remained sat for 5/10 more minutes before setting back off to our accommodation. A few minutes later a guy sees us walking across campus carrying our bag of food and runs after us asking if we work at the bakery (I guess since the bag was clearly labelled with the bakery name), I replied that no we were just students and the Bakery had unfortunately just closed 10 minutes previously. 

He became standoffish and insinuated that we had taken one of his bags that he reserved, I replied that I was sorry we couldn't help him but again, we were just students and had nothing to do with the bakery - we had just been given it from a worker. *(Stupidly)* I hadn't actually really processed at this time that we likely had indeed been given one of the bags he reserved since he was too late to pick them up, he proceeded to storm off shouting back at us that we bad people for not giving it him, because he was going to feed the homeless with that food. After hearing this my boyfriend asked me if we should just go after him and give him our bag and I replied no (in the moment I felt pretty hurt at his aggressive nature towards us). Its been about an hour now and i've been plagued by guilt surrounding it, I would never want to take away from a charitable cause and i've been really beating myself up over it, I was just hurt in the moment.

Fast forward to recently, we were in our home, just doing home stuff when she told me we need to talk.

I try to be blunt with her. No nefarious activity to report. 

She (my gf) took pictures of the messages & forced me to call my ex to tell her to stop texting me & that I can't see the bird.

I moved from south korea when I was 12 (now 18). So I still have citizenship and I have to go back to korea to do my mandatory military service eventually.

In simple ways of saying it, in south korea you can do your military service from when you are 18 to 28-29. Some people choose to enlist later and some people do it earlier. You serve for 2 years then you can do whatever.

I decided that I wanted to get it over with and do it before I went to college, so — very soon. So that I don’t have to worry about it after that. When I told my girlfriend (korean as well but american) she got angry and told me to consider other people before I did. We got into a fight and she called me an asshole for abandoning her and choosing to leave her just when we were about to start college. She wants me defer to at least until we finish college.

I moved from south korea when I was 12 (now 18). So I still have citizenship and I have to go back to korea to do my mandatory military service eventually.

In simple ways of saying it, in south korea you can do your military service from when you are 18 to 28-29. Some people choose to enlist later and some people do it earlier. You serve for 2 years then you can do whatever.

I decided that I wanted to get it over with and do it before I went to college, so — very soon. So that I don’t have to worry about it after that. When I told my girlfriend (korean as well but american) she got angry and told me to consider other people before I did. We got into a fight and she called me an asshole for abandoning her and choosing to leave her just when we were about to start college. She wants me defer to at least until we finish college.

67,1d5nrdd,WIBTA For hanging out with my friend when our other friend isn't there?,"I (16F) have two friends, Ella (17F) and Julia (16F), and we are all very close, having met in 2022 due to our shared interest in theatre. Julia has suffered a lot and finds it hard to trust her friends, and has bad relationship anxiety.

Background: It's quite hard to co-ordinate us all hanging out together because Ella and I both live in England, while Julia lives in the US. Last year, I bought tickets for a show that Ella and I could attend, and Julia was not in the country at the time so was unable to attend (we did plan to call her throughout the day so she could be with us, but obviously it's not the same as actually being there). Julia really freaked out at this and the emotions did cause a great detriment to her mental health. She said she would have dreams about ""cursing us due to the betrayal"" as well, and stopped speaking to us for a bit.

We are all three spending a few days together at the end of July while Julia is in England on holiday, which will be great and I'm really looking forward to it. Julia and I are also spending time alone a few days later, and Ella and Julia are also doing so. Julia goes back to the US at the end of July, and Ella invited me to her house for two days in mid-August. I have to admit that I have a lot more in common with Ella than Julia, and adore her company. I really value these 'solo' hangouts, but I don't want to accept the invitation knowing that the last time we hung out alone together, it really messed with Julia. My heart says that we shouldn't have to worry this much for someone else's mental health and having my own friendships shouldn't be a bad thing, and part of me also thinks that if Julia is happy to hang out with Ella or I one-on-one, then she should also be fine with Ella and I hanging out. However, I don't want to upset my friend.

TL;DR: My friend has bad relationship anxiety and would get upset if I hung out with a mutual friend by ourselves. Would I be the asshole for doing so?

Whether it's friends or even the career i want to have for myself. Don't even get me started about how she feels abt dating before college.. she is just a very judgmental person and will not hold back to say something nasty about ppl she doesn't even know. so a couple weeks ago i learned that my bfs parents are gonna sell their house and are planning to move to Alabama. It's either he stays here, i go with him, or we break up. He has contemplated staying here so it's not just all on me. It's just that living up there is much cheaper compared to where we are and he doesn't have a solid enough job to afford housing here. neither do i with the job i have, so we'd really be struggling if we tried to get an apartment together. His parents adore me and told me i am more than welcome to come so i am not concerned abt that at all. It's just my parents that are the issue. i know if i talked to my mom about it or my dad they'd immediately shut me down and tell me no and that i'm out of my mind. My mom would go as far as to try and physically stop me tbh. I am of age so nothing would occur but i wouldn't put it past her to try and call the police. So, i'm thinking about getting everything together, leaving, and just telling them through text. I just can't deal with all of their emotions. However I do feel like that may come off as cruel and i'm worried that this is genuinely gonna break her heart and the rest of my family.

I love this guy very much and in the three years we have been together he has always protected me and has taken care of me. he's been kinder to me then my family has ever been. I'm just very nervous on how this is all gonna go bc she isn't even aware that we've been dating all these years. When she first found out she told me to cut him off, that was the only choice i had if i wanted to keep dating him. So i can only imagine how she'd react when i tell her i'm just moving away. My family has had a lot of financial issues and we have been living in a hotel for 4 years now unfortunately. I just am worried that it's gonna come off as i'm abandoning them in all that mess. However being there has done horrible damage to my mental health and i feel so suffocated, depressed and easily set off bc of being in a room with 4 other ppl for years. i can't even have my own space or anything bc that's just not possible. Do you think this is a good way to handle things?

i forgot to mention that i have around 10k saved so far and they plan on selling the house sometime in september if not later. my mom has these high expectations to be a doctor but honestly i just want to go to trade school and work in a hair salon. something she's not afraid to tell me is mediocre at best and how disappointed she'd be. i just don't know what to do bc i see how my brother is literally 25, not allowed to have a gf and is still guilt tripped into living at home. i can only imagine what life would be for me if i stay here

the other day, 5 of my friends and i went out for dinner, and Matt was sitting across from us alone. i asked him if he’d like to sit with us, and though he declined he did come and eat some of our food (after asking). the thing is, my friends don’t really know him, and they felt visibly awkward - but in his defence we’ve all been in the same school for the past 4 years, so it’s not like he was a total stranger either. when we were leaving, i asked if he had a ride back to our hotel, to which he said ‘no, i was kinda expecting that you would take me back since we’re staying at the same place’. i didn’t ask them beforehand whether we could take Matt home with us bc it was a spur-of-the-moment thing and i didn’t want Matt to be left alone without any transport back. still, what he said was bizarre to me because we’re at a resort town, not our home city - why wouldn’t anyone plan a route home from a place they’ve never been to for safety’s sake? 

on the way back, none of the other girls were really talking to Matt and were texting my friend sitting next to me up front as a liaison, because they didn’t want to talk to him directly for whatever reason, which i felt was really mean. when we got home and he left the cab, they said to me that they don’t want to take someone back at random without consulting them first, especially someone they barely interacted with. to which i reminded them that it was a spontaneous decision and it would be far better than leaving our classmate alone in a new place, regardless of whether they like Matt or not - i didn’t have time to consult them anyways.

He called me and followed me and even said that he would drop me off home and I was acting like a psycho dramatic person and I should just get back in the car and go home with him.

But I didn’t and eventually he left and I took a cab home. He’s been calling me non-stop since then and I’ve informed him that I’d reached home and I need some time to cool down but still he’s bombarding my phone with texts.

He did wait and ask me to go back with him. Did I behave like a crazy person?

Okay, a little background info, when I (26M) was 18 I got stupid drunk with my friends and we thought it would be funny if I got ordained online, I didnt remember it the next morning and only found out when they sent me a congratulations email on becoming an ordained minister. I didnt bother to change it and left it as a funny story to tell and something that could one day come in handy. But technically I was now a member of the clergy of this strange online church.

Its vaguely necessary to know that my family is also very catholic and I was pretty sure the online church was protestant or nothing specific at all, whatever it was it definitely was not catholic so my family, especially the older ones, would not approve, so I kept the story only for friends or icebreakers. 

My little drunken choice had no real effect on my life whatsoever until a few months ago when my childhood friend (26F) read an email over my shoulder of the ministry congratulating me on the anniversary of me getting ordained and it referred to me as Reverend (my name here).

We hung out again yesterday and she did it again in front of all our friends and everyone was really confused and probably a bit weirded out. She continued and one of our friends made it into a s3xyal joke despite both of us being in a relationship with other people.

Background information
To keep this simple My sister(22) and I(25) live together. My sister doesn't have kids but I adopted my little cousin (9). She works the night shift and comes home after we're both asleep.

The issue is that my sister is greedy with food, especially fast food. One time we ordered fast food we got a bucket of chicken. 8 pieces and 2 sides. Me and my cousin ate 3 pieces total and maybe half the sides. The next morning there was only have a piece of chicken left and no sides. My sister does this every time we get fast food.

I didn't want to start a fight so here recently I've been leaving half the food in the fridge for her and have put whatever me and my cousin don't eat of the other half in my mini fridge in my room. I thought this was fair since she paid for half the food and I the other half (I text her the price and she venmos me when she gets home).

Well she went intoi mini fridge (she wanted one of my coffees) and saw the food. This obviously started an argument. There were things said on both sides and now she's staying with our parents for the time being. I feel guilty for not just talking to her but she's always been guarded about her weight and I knew that's how she would have taken it.

Our parents have told me off and said I had no right to hide food. Now I'm wondering if I'm the A.


Edit:

I just wanted to thank everyone for their input. I see that while I'm not wrong to want the half of the food I'd payed for, I was being a bit judgemental with my sister. You've shown me that I seem to be exaggerating (even if unintentionally) the amount of food she's eating. 

I'm going to apologize to her tonight for the things I said during our argument and see if we can come to an agreement. Whether it'll be portioning thing out or just buying separate, I don't know yet. I also don't know if this will work out. My sister has always been snippy when it comes to food due to her weight. Then again it's been a while since I last tried because of her past behavior so maybe she's matured. Guess I'll find out tonight. Wish me luck.

74,1d5kw2y,AITA for telling my girlfriend it is not my job to calm her down,"I (34M) am currently on a trip with my  GF (41F). It is a job trip, but I invited her to come along me (all paid for me). In part because I thought it could be nice but mostly because in the last 5 work trips I have taken she always gets angry and starts fights. Her points included not taking her with me.

So, the day of the trip,  20 minutes before taking the bus to the airport she tells me that she is feelimg bad. I asked her what was wrong and if she felt fine for travel. She said ""I don't know"". ""What choice do I have?"".

We got to our room and it doesn't have a private washroom (I misread the booking). I know that this is unnaceptable for her and her OCD. So I try to take her to a new hotel (losing my money on the first one) and she said no. Thankfully the staff was very understanding at hotel 1 and (for a fee) let us switch rooms and gave us a washroom only for us (for her). 

I told her this and she got even angrier. She started berating me telling me: 

- She is never going on a trip with me again.
- Why didn't I ask her to book the room with me. This one is a valid point. I apologized back then.
- Why didn't I cancel my trip when she was feeling bad before?
- To ""ignore her and go to the conference"". She told me that 3 times. I asked her what to do with food another 3 times and she said she could take care of herself.

I told her I made a honest mistake (which I tried to fix) and that it was unfair to treat me like that. She continued the fight and I answered to her multiple accusations and left her alone to go to the conference.

She got mad that I left her alone (?), we had another fight and she said that I never can calm her down. I answered ""sorry, everybody else had to learn to control their anger without lashing out and it   is not my job to do it for you"".

She made another scene about leaving (alone, in the middle of the night 2500 km from home) and after I told her how insane that was, we went to sleep, angry.

Was I the asshole for telling her that it was not my job to calm her down?. Also for not cancelling the trip before? I am regretting that one... I should have never invited her on the first place, but in the last 6 months we had not had a fight and things were going great.

75,1d5kr3u,AITA for comparing my boyfriend to others?,"Tl;dr: Had surgery, told LDR boyfriend he was the only friend not checking in on me, he says I'm accusing him of being shitty and a defective person. 

Details:

I (25F) recently had a surgery with a complicated recovery. Right after, my boyfriend (26M, long distance relationship) messaged me to ask how things went. But in the following 5 days, he never asked how I was doing. When I told him, he talked back, but didn't take initiative. 

In the 4th day, I told him pain had gotten worse. In the 5th day, it was even worse. After the day passed I realized I hadn't shared how I was doing and he hadn't asked either, which hurt me a bit. I had even asked about his day, and he replied but didn't ask back.

So I messaged him saying that all people closest to me had been checking in on me unprompted except him, and it's hard not to feel like he doesn't care. I admitted I may be cranky due to pain, and finished by saying it was not a big deal and I loved him.

He said he disagreed, that the subject had just come up organically, and I wasn't being fair.

At this point it was late and I think arguing would be productive because he struggles with long fights. I told him that, and that I was going to sleep. I assured him I loved him and he's the best, and apologized for being needy.

He said that stopping wasn't better, that I can't just go ""hey you're a shitty boyfriend but it's all cool k bye"", and that ""it's psychotic"". 

At that point I started crying and told him I had to stop (stuffy nose would be bad in recovery). 

In the following day we made up and he apologized for making me feel bad. But I didn't think his reaction was the healthiest, so I brought it up a few days later.

He says that the problem was the comparison I started off with; that it was essentially the same as saying ""you're defective"" and ""it is wrong to be you"".

I wouldn't say these statements are comparable at all. When I pushed he said my phrasing was ""maybe a bit less agressive"" than that, but he doesn't see how he could interpret it differently.

I'm really thrown off by this. Am I such an asshole for the comparison?

77,1d5k4k4,AITA for being cranky at my husband for his ‘healthy living’? ,"My husband 31M and I 32F, have been together for 9 years now. We have a 7 year old son. Ever since we started this relationship, we spent our time bonding with drinking together even if it’s just the two of us. I haven’t been smoking when we met but he convinced me with vaping in 2020 with all the flavored juices he would get for me. (By convincing, he did not only ask me to try it but he bought me my own vape and continued to refill my pods everytime it ran out) Quite frankly, I liked the flavors and it stopped me from stress eating. I have been vaping since then. 

Just a couple of months ago, he decided to live healthy by watching what he eats (counts carbs), works out everyday and makes a trip to the lake to jog. 

Since I mostly cook for the family, I find myself so irritated when he would want his meal a specific way, he would also insist that I weigh everything I put in his meal. Sometimes I would also find him always saying something about what I eat and how many calories that would be for me. So I eventually started with intermittent fasting. After a week he said that wouldn’t work out cause it has to be accompanied by calorie deficit. Which I tried to apply but I found it bothersome so I just eventually used estimates. 

It’s been 3 months and we’re still in the same state, and now every time he talks about anything healthy or his exercises, it just annoys me to the point that I’m giving him answers/comments that are not so nice and of course he’s upset about it. 

Just a couple of days ago, he quit vaping too. Now I feel like I’m doomed being unhealthy while he’s doing his best to be one with all the changes he applied in just months. I have PCOS and I feel like I should be trying harder but the pressure is just pulling me away from it.

They were also angry with the fact that I moved out of state for college but I have much opportunities going to a renowned uni out of state and my mom is fine with it.

80,1d5jg7g,AITA for not 'caring' about my 34 year old partner when he overexerted himself? ,"The partner in this story (M34) has a new personal trainer who is not a qualified nutritionist. This PT advised him to stop eating breakfast so he would see results faster (intermittent fasting). While that may work really well for some people, e.g. I often skip breakfast and eat my first meal at noon; I cannot stress enough how bad this advice is for my partner. 

My partner is the sort of person who will get very lethargic if he's hungry, it impacts on his mood, his concentration - everything. He genuinely becomes a different person when he is hungry. My advice was that he would be able to achieve the same fast results if he tracked his calories and reduced them overall by the same amount. I make his breakfasts, they're between 400-500cals. He doesn't want to track his calories, because that is 'too hard'. He wants me to do it for him. Sorry but no.

So he skipped breakfast three days in a row, yesterday being the third day. In the evening he went to play football and played a particularly challenging match.

On the way home (10:30 at night) he started to feel dizzy and faint and rang me to let me know. I told him to eat something and go to his family home because it is a shorter drive (and because his mother will baby him when I don't. But I didn't say that part out loud). He said he has chewing gum and he wants to be in his own bed. Fine. I told him I was going to bed though. 

He got home around 11:30—midnight. I was sleeping. He ate a single banana and had a shower. In the shower he started to feel faint again. Because of this, he proceeded to turn on ALL OF THE LIGHTS, and was walking around naked, shivering, and moaning LOUD like his appendix burst or like he broke something.

I woke up initially annoyed, then confused. I asked him what's wrong, fully expecting to see a broken limb. Instead of responding, he just kept moaning. No words. Eventually he was able to tell me that he is cold and feels faint. I got up, put a bunch of blankets on him in bed and gave him a tablespoon of honey. Shivering immediately subsided, and he fell asleep. It took me another two hours to go back to sleep after that. 

This morning he tells me that I'm in the wrong because I was mad at him, not worried enough, and ""not caring enough like his mum would have been"". So even though I did everything right, and his symptoms had subsided quickly ... I'm a bad partner because I didn't baby the 34 year old. AITA? 

I think I may be TA because I come from a slavic background where we were all outwardly ""cold"" to each other but I thought my actions last night showed care despite how I felt. So, Reddit, let me have it.

82,1d5j0o8,AITA for blowing up my brother in law upcoming wedding?,"About 8 months ago, my brother in law (husband’s brother) introduced us to his girlfriend. She and I hit it off immediately! She was sweet, funny and seemed to genuinely like him! They looked great together. After about 3-4 months, he proposed and she said yes. We were happy for them since they’re both a bit older.

My husband and I are US citizens originally from a small (xcuse me french) *shithole country 😩 Our community in our town is very involved with each other (everyone in everyone’s business) with all the gossip and toxicity that follow small communities everywhere. 

2 months ago, I happened to overhear my BIL with his friends when they came over to watch a NBA game. My husband had gone to bed but they were still drinking and talking in the living room. I was trying to find ways to gently tell them to go home when I heard them.

BIL was telling them he was only with his fiancée for a green card, that she was fat/ugly and he was gonna bide his time until he got his citizenship then bounce. He was wondering whether he should get a vasectomy to not get her pregnant and be stuck paying child support forever. 

I was shocked. Almost frozen from stupefaction. I’m not naive. I had heard of ppl within our community who had only married for a green card (unfortunately).

But I genuinely thought BIL was different. His fiancée was the sweetest girl and to think she was gonna have her life almost destroyed over this. Ummm so yeah, I told her. 

It wasn’t an easy conversation. She almost didn’t believe me. She confronted him and he swore up and down that I lied and was just jealous (??). 

She stayed with him for awhile. In the meantime, BIL blew up at me, my husband, rallied his parents & siblings against me. I was basically a lying traitorous snake who was trying to ruin the life of a good son. I got threatening messages from the family & the community at large. 

The fiancée stayed a bit but I guess she eventually couldn’t trust him anymore so she broke off the engagement and broke off all contact with his whole family (including me who told her). My BIL has to either leave the country soon or be out of legal status (become undocumented so to speak). 

I’m now pretty much a pariah. They’ve gaslighted me by saying I misheard what BIL said. That he was just joking among friends. That I had seen how much they were in love so why would I think he was only there for a GC? 

That I shouldn't have “tattled” to someone I’d only met a few months prior over family I’ve known for years. That I should have at least spoken with him before going to her. That even she knew i was crazy that’s why she cut off all contact with me anyway.

Needless to say, the stress on my marriage has been huge. My husband tries to be supportive but I can tell he’s under huge strain and thinks I shouldn’t have gotten involved at all.  I’m lost and feel very much alone.

AITA? 



EDIT: Thank you for all the replies!! I’m gonna try to reply to many as I can when I’m able but I’m so overwhelmed right now 😭😭😭 Thank you for affirming that I wasn’t wrong for telling her. It’s been a very lonely (and scary ngl) experience so far. People around me literally hate me (it’s apparently an open secret and an unofficial collective silent agreement to let “our people” defraud others to be able to stay in this country). 

That strangers are siding with me and telling me I’m not a horrible person but people I’ve known for years (including my own family) have been either angry or giving me the cold shoulder… it’s bittersweet. I love you all but it hurts.

I got a special travel credit card specifically for the trip. Then he uninvited me randomly and said he wants a “solo” trip. Next thing I know he invited his friend Adam and it turned into a guys trip. He told me he doesn’t want me to go because it’s a “guys thing”, and then Adam invited Leo and Leo invited a girl. So it wasn’t even a “guys thing” anymore. Even though it was originally supposed to be a trip for us. Then he re-invited me a month before he left because he randomly had a change of heart. Then right before he left on his trip my mom had a health issue and was in critical condition so I didn’t go and he didn’t really talk to me at all because he was busy with the traveling and it was hectic. I didn’t expect him to cancel his trip because of my mom but I was really upset he wasn’t there for me, I don’t want to sound entitled to his attention because I understand he’s on vacation but he’s my partner I feel like he is the one person who is supposed to be my rock and support me when I’m going through a hard time and he would only text me like twice a day and it was to say he got back to his hotel and is going to sleep. He wouldn’t even read the vent messages I sent about my mom, she was in a coma when he left and she woke up during his trip but was in severe condition and he claimed he “didn’t know” even though I told him, he just didn’t read it.

So when he got back from his trip 2 months later he told me he would take me to Bali to make it up to me and it would be “our” trip. I just found out he invited Adam. So I’m annoyed because he made it sound like Bali was his way of making it up to me and make me feel special and better about the situation of him ignoring me while my mom literally almost died, and I’m annoyed because Italy was supposed to be our trip and I planned ahead for it just to be uninvited and then replaced by Adam. 

I don’t know if I’m being entitled because he’s paying for everything but I just feel like if he says it’s “our” trip, as in a relationship trip then it should be a trip for us and not him and his friends. He thinks I’m choosing to relate Italy to this situation but it’s not actually related, he thinks I just want a reason to be mad. Am I being entitled/AITA? I get it’s his money and he’s paying but I’m a good girlfriend to him and he made it seem like Bali was his way to make it up to me for not being there for me.

88,1d5i0r5,AITA For not attending my brothers wedding ,"
Myself F(34) told my brother (33) and wife to be (33) myself and my son (12) ""page boy"". We are not attending their wedding in January. Their wedding is in June. 


From the time they were engaged 5 years ago, they wanted my son to be involved, which was OK...... OK, on planning the wedding, my brother had promised my son that he was bringing him to get his hair cut. My son has ASD, ADHD and other issues, so this was to get him used to his new hair cut, and he was let down. I told my brother this, and he thought it wasn't a big deal.

 Then a promise was made to have transportation to the venue, which is in the middle of nowhere again. This was taken from the time of the venue being chosen as I don't drive and wasn't given a plus one, which I was fine with. I was told, on my son's birthday, sorry I can't take you, but I'll take kiddo on the day, making it near enough impossible for me to make it there myself.

When I asked if I could drop a gift recently, I was blanked by my brother and was met with a text from his future wife saying we weren't welcome, and it would be too upsetting for my brother to receive anything from us. It was a sentimental gift celebrating our mother who wouldn't be there. 

And something for her to put in her flowers (a pearl from my mam's necklace she had worn at her wedding) if she wanted it.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-01,"AITA For not attending my brothers wedding  
Myself F(34) told my brother (33) and wife to be (33) myself and my son (12) ""page boy"". We are not attending their wedding in January. Their wedding is in June. 


From the time they were engaged 5 years ago, they wanted my son to be involved, which was OK...... OK, on planning the wedding, my brother had promised my son that he was bringing him to get his hair cut. My son has ASD, ADHD and other issues, so this was to get him used to his new hair cut, and he was let down. I told my brother this, and he thought it wasn't a big deal.

 Then a promise was made to have transportation to the venue, which is in the middle of nowhere again. This was taken from the time of the venue being chosen as I don't drive and wasn't given a plus one, which I was fine with. I was told, on my son's birthday, sorry I can't take you, but I'll take kiddo on the day, making it near enough impossible for me to make it there myself. 


As mentioned, my son has issues, so I asked if there was a room I could book at the venue. I was told ohh we forgot to tell you after the ceremony that the kids at the wedding party are not allowed to attend the party afterward and need to go home.

He told me that they don't really care about that. 

However, I didn't tell him another reason as to why I don't call is because a while back my family visited them, and during this visit my grandparents proceeded to rank all of their grandchildren on who speaks Spanish the best and who speaks it the worst. I was placed second to last; with my sibling ranked last. For added context my sibling has a learning disability which only allows them to speak one language which is English. My grandparents know about their disability. I found this comment to be hurtful and left me and my sibling very self concious and insecure of our abilities, but perhaps we are just too sensitive.

91,1d5hi28,AITA for not wanting my husband to go on a boys trip while i'm at home with our newborn,"Tldr; my husband, who's really great in general, wants to go on a boys trip with his brother  while we have a newborn at home and i'm going back to work.

So, my husband (34m) and I (28f) just had a baby boy. He's amazing, precious, and very gassy at times. I had a c-section, not by choice, and am still recovering. Baby boy is about two weeks old.

My husband is great, he shares all the responsibilities with me, supports me postpartum, and really makes sure baby boy and I are happy and healthy.

The thing is, my husband hasn't worked for a while now and i'm the sole provider at the moment. His dad passed away about two months ago and he had to leave me when I was 9 months pregnant (his family lives in a different country) for 3 weeks because none of his siblings wanted to manage everything around his dad's passing away. He stopped working when he left and hasn't gotten back to it since. We have talked about it and he will get back to work in the near future (a month or so).

I worked until the day I gave birth, I own a small business and need to get back to partial work in a few days. I will have to get back to full time in about 3 weeks.

Now, my husband has a brother that isn't the best family guy. He provides very little for his family, has 5 kids he often leaves his wife alone with, only ""helps to babysit"" sometimes and in general isn't really there unless it has to do with keeping the kids alive at max.

My husband's brother won some football tickets about 6 months ago and invited my husband and his dad to go with (my husband had to pay for his submission to that contest tho). Now that my FIL passed away, my husband's brother wants them both to go to that football game abroad and stay for 4 days. My husband doesn't just want to go, he made it a fact, and says his brother said this would be a trip in memory of their father.

Idk how i'll do 4 days with baby boy alone at home. He will be a 5 weeks old and I will be freshly back to work. My mom will be able to help but I can't just leave the kid with her at this stage. I told my husband there's no way he's leaving and now he is mad at me and says he will be going anyway and i'm an asshole for not understanding him.

I will say, before their father died, I still daid the same thing - i'll have a newborn at home and won't want him to leave. This has been known for over 6 months now.

I then proceeded to do her nails and pedicure and charged her my price. I would agree that I did charge her full price because nail products are not CHEAP!!

A few days ago, she had arrived at the bar before I did and asked me to join her. I had said a quick hi to my friends at the main table but Charmaine pulled out a seat for me and we talked for a while.

96,1d5gwno,AITA for asking my housemate if he wants to give his cat away to my friend?,"My housemate and I moved in together without knowing each other beforehand. He mentioned he had a cat, and I thought I wasn't allergic. On the day we viewed the apartment, he assured me that if I had any issues with the cat, it wouldn't have to stay with us.

A few months in, I developed a bad cough and itchy eyes. The doctor said I had a cat allergy. Feeling bad, as I knew my housemate loved his cat, I purchased HEPA filters, a Roomba, and allergen-reducing cat food. I also took Claritin daily, but I still couldn’t sleep due to my allergies. I informed him, but nothing was ever really done.

My housemate, a medical student, got a gf started spending less time with the cat. He vacuumed only about once a month and never maintained the cat dander. When my housemate was home, he often locked the cat out of his room. I knew the cat wasn’t being brushed either, as I would brush her and see heaps of fur. His cat requires a lot of attention and care, and if no one spends time with her during the day, she keeps me up at night by clawing at my door. I didn’t think the cat was living its best life, and I also had bad allergies, so I suggested giving the cat to my friend, who loves cats and wfh. My housemate and his gf had previously mentioned giving the cat to another student, so I thought my suggestion was reasonable. They responded that they wanted to keep the cat as long as possible. I brought this up several times. In hindsight, I should have addressed the lack of care for the cat earlier, but I knew my housemate had a lot on his plate, so I tried to manage my allergies.

A year later, his gf lashed out at me, saying she had irritations with me, specifically my suggestion to give away the cat. She told me requesting someone to give their cat away was completely unethical. I explained that he doesn't maintain cat dander well and doesn't spend any time with his cat. I also constantly bring up my allergies.

Am I the asshole for suggesting they give the cat to my friend, who is well-off and works from home?

After this confrontation, my housemate started brushing the cat twice a week and spent 2-3 nights a week sleeping at home with her. However, without asking for permission, he let his gf's cat move into his room. My allergies are as bad as ever, and I’m getting no sleep.

My housemate and I moved in together without knowing each other beforehand. He mentioned he had a cat, and I thought I wasn't allergic. On the day we viewed the apartment, he assured me that if I had any issues with the cat, it wouldn't have to stay with us.

A few months in, I developed a bad cough and itchy eyes. The doctor said I had a cat allergy. Feeling bad, as I knew my housemate loved his cat, I purchased HEPA filters, a Roomba, and allergen-reducing cat food. I also took Claritin daily, but I still couldn’t sleep due to my allergies. I informed him, but nothing was ever really done.

My housemate, a medical student, got a gf started spending less time with the cat. He vacuumed only about once a month and never maintained the cat dander. When my housemate was home, he often locked the cat out of his room. I knew the cat wasn’t being brushed either, as I would brush her and see heaps of fur. His cat requires a lot of attention and care, and if no one spends time with her during the day, she keeps me up at night by clawing at my door. I didn’t think the cat was living its best life, and I also had bad allergies, so I suggested giving the cat to my friend, who loves cats and wfh. My housemate and his gf had previously mentioned giving the cat to another student, so I thought my suggestion was reasonable. They responded that they wanted to keep the cat as long as possible. I brought this up several times. In hindsight, I should have addressed the lack of care for the cat earlier, but I knew my housemate had a lot on his plate, so I tried to manage my allergies.

A year later, his gf lashed out at me, saying she had irritations with me, specifically my suggestion to give away the cat. She told me requesting someone to give their cat away was completely unethical. I explained that he doesn't maintain cat dander well and doesn't spend any time with his cat. I also constantly bring up my allergies.

Am I the asshole for suggesting they give the cat to my friend, who is well-off and works from home?

After this confrontation, my housemate started brushing the cat twice a week and spent 2-3 nights a week sleeping at home with her. However, without asking for permission, he let his gf's cat move into his room. My allergies are as bad as ever, and I’m getting no sleep.

98,1d5gaua,AITA for not knowing roommate has sleeping issues with noise or light of any kind. ,"Hello everyone,

So, I live in a student residence where they have shared rooms. My roommate came around 3 weeks ago . I am an early sleeper, I sleep around 10:30PM. When I want to stay up late, then maybe around 12:00PM I go to bed. But for the past few weeks, I have been on holiday and couldn't go back home so I have been sleeping really late, at around 2:00PM.

With my eyes, doing anything without enough light gives me a headache and makes my eyes really watery. So when it's night time, I switch on the light on my side of the room. She's the 1st roommate I have that sleeps early. But turns out, she can't sleep with any form on light on or noise on, even a small lamp. And I make some noise as I am awake.

I had no idea she couldn't sleep properly for the past few weeks. I didn't realize it was an issue with her cause I'm normally the first to sleep with my previous roommates and I would go to sleep with the lights on since they were using it. I didn't mind cause I can sleep with lights on and moderate noise and vice-versa for them.

She showed no signs that this was bothering her and I thought everything was fine. I am not the most emotionally intelligent person. Most times, unless someone tells me directly that something is wrong, I never have a clue. There was a time, my best friend was upset with me for two days, I didn't notice till she told me. 

So when I knew, I wanted to talk with her and figure out if there was anything else that I was doing that bothered her, and to apologize. But she was acting rude imo the whole time. I was trying to explain that I didn't know and that from now on, I'll go back to sleeping early so she can sleep. She was acting like she couldn't hear me the whole time. Then she burst out that I should've known, it's basic respect....... Then I told her not really, I once had a roommate Sarah who spent almost the whole day as listening to music at a very high volume on a speaker. Sarah was a very sweet girl and she assumed I wouldn't mind cause her previous roommate liked that and would sometimes suggest songs. I had to mention I didn't like that and she stopped. So sometimes people don't realise. I really didn't know. All you had to do was tell me, and I would've stopped.

Then she started getting angry and was saying that her feelings are valid and I told her that her feelings are valid, there was never an argument about that, you've not been sleeping properly for a few weeks, of course you're gonna be angry, and I just want to have a conversation with you on it, I am not attacking you. Then I started to apologise to her, saying I'm sorry and I wish I knew earlier, then she stood up and slammed the door. I waited a bit then followed her to still apologise but she told me to leave her alone.

We haven't spoken since and it's been two days. Am I the asshole? what can I do to make the situation better?

I felt really uncomfortable with this. I had never met this person before and didn’t want a stranger to be in my apartment, so I was entirely against this.

we both are working.

My sister has started to travel for work since last year. She has been to singapore and philippines twice. 

This is the first time she is going to france for an entire month. 

I have been helping her in selecting between items while ordering stuff and in general by discussing things with her in the last 10 days. 

Tonight she will leave at 3am. 

She is all set, has packed everything and her office cab will be waiting at our house at 3am to take her to airport. 

I like playing football, and it is the only sport I watch. I want to watch the final with my friends which starts at 12:30 AM. 

I discussed with my sister that I also want to watch the final, and she says that I should go to my friends place and we'll see each other off before I go, and she'll leave at 3AM but I suspect she might feel a bit alone when leaving an empty house and no one to hear goodbye from. I can call her but that's not the same thing. 

my LDR gf(24F) is not getting it that how can I miss seeing my sister off for enjoying the match with my friends. 

Now I am having second thoughts on what to do. If I could I would want to do both. 

My friends will watch the match with or without me, but they are eagerly expecting me to come, and I had told them to keep snacks and beer ready and that I'll be there. 

I didn't notice earlier when confirming with my friends that 2nd june 12:30 AM would mean the match will be today's night and collide completely with my sister's leaving to france. 

Am I being immature. I want to watch the match but it isn't that I will be extremely sad if I don't.

Yesterday evening, I got changed to go to bed. Ella was in the room, at my desk doing some revision, but I didn’t really think that it would impact her. I did say that I was going to get changed and she didn’t seem to care. I don’t wear a bra to sleep so I took it off before putting on my pyjama shirt. My bare chest was visible for maybe 10 seconds at most, and she screamed and accused me of flashing her.

I kind of laughed at her response because it was unexpected, and asked her why this was so dramatic. She said it was really inappropriate for me to be topless around someone else, and that she couldn’t believe I had been so disrespectful.

It’s probably cultural differences - I live in the UK, but until I was 13 I lived in the Netherlands, and there the human form is not kept secret or demonised. I’ve seen my family members naked and I’m not uncomfortable around bodies - we all have one, after all.

I apologised, but said that I didn’t understand why it was disrespectful as it’s not as if I was doing anything sexual. It was a genuine question, but she just said I was being “unbelievable”. I said that it seems to me that she just needs to be more comfortable around bodies, because they’re not inherently sexual or inappropriate.

She accused me of being “perverse” and of “forcing” myself upon her. I am a lesbian, so she could think that I fancy her (for the record, I do not) or be uncomfortable with sharing a bed. She didn’t explicitly say any of this, but again I am autistic so she could have said it just indirectly, and then me getting changed in front of her could have been the “last straw”.

1. dated his cousin
2. cheated on her
3. after they broke up he harassed her
4. stalked her and emotionally manipulated her
5. tried to gaslight our entire circle that he was the victim and that she (his ex) and her friends were out to destroy his life.

now, i’m all for change. like if you can, sure. but i highly don’t trust this guy, especially since this only happened a year ago. not even his closest friends trust him — they said it themselves. 

I texted him, saying that he shouldn’t dare hurt her because I have the money to fly out and do the same, and his friends screenshotted his response to me (in their gc). He was saying things like “why does she care?” and “it’s not her life”. 

When i found out about their new relationship, i wasn’t just disgusted at him, but i was shocked for her, but i guess it’s partly my fault that she didn’t know the full story. 

Now, my friend is a very gullible girl. she’s too trusting, and super vulnerable, will believe anything someone says in a heartbeat. So i’m very worried about her, and scared that she’ll get manipulated out of her wits. 

So when i found out they got together, i immediately went to text my friend. we had a long convo — and i told her to break up with him, because it’s unlikely he’ll change his ways (he still likes emitting parts of stories to keep himself in good light, even lying about some stuff to his friends). She says she trusts him, but that is the thing i’m most worried about. 

I talked ab this to his three closest (the ones that don’t trust him either) and although they don’t want to be involved (which i understand and won’t involve them anymore) one of them said that maybe he did change, and we’d never know if he did or not if we don’t change our views on him. AITA?

tl;dr friend dates super abusive and manipulative guy that lies to his friends and i told her that she should probably break up with him.


update 1: thanks for the replies yall. there’s not much i can do atm so i’ll take the advice and just watch from the sidelines. and i saw a reply saying it’s a cycle; no it’s not, i was the one that kind of “raised” her so i know she’s not that dumb to “fix him”, but i just didn’t want her to go through that pain at all in the first place because i had a few friends that did that before; i know the pain of the cycle because i went through it a few times. it was worth it, because in the end my friends broke free, and we’re still close till now.

106,1d5dxqb,AITA for inviting a pizza man to a party in progress without consulting the other guests?,"A bit of background, first of all. I (25F) work in a very male dominated workplace where I've been for 3 years, and have a lot of male friends, but more female friends than most of my coworkers do. I threw a party to celebrate my old friend Emma (25F) being hired at my company (thanks to a recommendation from me). All in all, there were 4 women at the party (including me and Emma) and 12 men.

One of the guys, Jack, who was there, was lamenting to me right from the start what a ""sausage fest"" it was. He  said he was expecting ""more chicks"" because it was hosted by a woman to celebrate the hiring of a woman. We ordered some large pizzas, and a man came to deliver them.

I jokingly said to the pizza man Jay, ""Hey, welcome to the party!""

He said to me ""Sounds fun. I used to love parties but I haven't been to a party in a long time.""

I asked him when he was done work and he said he was done in an hour. I told him to come over then. I promised him beer and pizza when he arrived. The party continued and I danced with a few people before Jay got there. He showed up and we started talking. I ended up dancing with him, and introducing him to some of the other guests. At the end of the party, I said goodbye to everyone else and went upstairs with Jay

Jack texted my after, asking me ""Why did you invite one more dude when it was already a sausage fest? Then you gave him free beer after telling everyone else to bring their own. You asked him to dance but didn't dance at all with half the other men there. Then you asked him to stay in front of everyone else while they were leaving which seems extremely rude. It makes it even worse that you invited him while the party was already in progress. All I'm saying is that when you throw a party, respect your guests.""

107,1d5dxkp,AITA for informing my coworker that everyone on one side of the office was talking about her?,"For context where I work everyone in my department is split up into two rooms. 
There are four of us in each room and we all share one supervisor. Let's refer to this supervisor as ""Red"". 

On the side of the office I sit on we are pretty efficient and get things done in a more timely fashion than the other side. This is pretty obvious to us bc we can all see each other's numbers. What those numbers correlate to is not really important to this post though but just know we can see them. 

The other side of the office has one associate, we'll call her ""Blue"" that has a harder time keeping up with the numbers that everyone else does. 

For months and weeks on end everyone on my side complains about ""Blue"" including my supervisor. My supervisor will literally gossip with everyone on my side of the office about anything that goes on on the other side of the office. But she takes a very special interest in saying things about Blue. 

This has bothered for some time bc it is super unprofessional to talk about your subordinate with that person's peers when you are a supervisor. 

Yesterday I finally decided enough is enough. I'm going to pull Blue aside so that she aware of the situation. I let her know once everyone had left the office and it was just me and her. She had a complete meltdown. 

Am I the asshole for saying something? I couldn't go to my supervisor bc she's literally part of the problem! But now I'm being made to feel like I said something when it ""wasn't my place"". 

Edit: for clarification, I didn't let her know that everyone is talking about her. I told her the her word for word ""you know how we can all see the numbers and stuff, I wanted to let you know that your numbers are being watched"". 

Edit: another update for more info. 
We don't have HR present. The only person above Red is the VP and jsyk all of this did come out and the VP's solution was to have a meeting with both me and Red present in one room and ask me why I said anything to Blue. Just so guys know what type of company I'm dealing with here. 

Edit: final edit I promise! 
I'm fine with being labeled the A-hole, don't take my comments as me being purposefully obtuse. I didn't make this post to prove I'm right, I made it to get an honest answer outside of my, admittedly, strong personality/own personal world view. 

I am super direct and I'm very much about ""say it to my face or don't say it at all"" and I often times don't realize that a lot of people are a lot more sensitive than me about their jobs (I'm literally here to do my job, get my check and go home, I don't care what anyone says about me), and that is something I'm am working on. 

But my intentions were in no way malicious, I literally treat people the way I want to be treated and this is something I would hope someone would tell me, but, like I said I'm learning that I'm not the norm. 

Most people agreed that I'm the A-hole (I don't curse, don't judge me 😤) so I will take that knowledge with me when I return to work on Monday and try to mend this situation as best as I can. 

It was never my intention to hurt anyone's feelings and I honestly thought I was doing her a service by saying something 🤷🏾‍♀️.

108,1d5dpt5,AITA for picking up my stepson from time to time?,"My husband (m41) thinks that I (f31) baby his Son (m18). Hubby says Son will never learn independence if I continue to do this. 

Background if needed: Son started living with us a year and a half ago. He moved across the world to do this. This is the first time father and son have lived together as Hubby left his home country when Son was small. Reasons for this include to create a better life for himself and his son, and Son's mother was preventing Hubby access out of spite. Hubby still sent money to Son's grandmother until Son's mother aquisted and accepted it. 

Fast forward to now. Son is a good kid but is still figuring out life and being his mother's one and only, had everything done for him until now. Since living with us, he has learnt to cook by preparing dinner with me almost every night. He does his own laundry and whilst it isn't always done well, he does do the basic chores we require.

However, Son doesn't come out of his room until dinner, games till late, needs to be reminded to do his chores and sometimes doesn't do them properly, and isn't looking for jobs to help support himself. Hubby thinks he is spoilt and lazy and he is part of the snowflake generation. Sometimes this is worsened by a belief that Son is doing these things (or not doing) because Son's mother is encouraging Son to be lazy in order to get back at Hubby. Its complicated, but ultimately it is a typical ""Parent wants Teenager to get his life together, and Teenager ignoring their advice on how to do so"". 

While I want Son to get himself sorted, I feel like Hubby is being harsh. Hubby thinks I'm too soft and that's because I'm also part of a snowflake generation and haven't had as hard a life as Hubby. This comes to a head from time to time. The latest occasion was when Son told me the trains aren't running due to track maintenance and it'll take him 2 hours to get to University for his exam. Its about a 30 min drive so I offered to drop him off before, or pick him up after the exam. He said if i could pick him up it would be great.

Hubby was furious. He said he needs to learn to sort himself out. I said I did not think helping him from time to time will prevent him from growing into an independent adult. While Hubby was going off, I found out Hubby believed I was driving Son to train station which is 5-10 mins away. At this point, he wouldn't even let me finish my sentences so I said we can talk about this when things have cooled down. This means I will likely be stonewalled for the rest of the weekend.

So AITA for offering to help my stepson and go against what his father believes is good for him? It is drizzling and whilst inconvenient, is nothing an umbrella won't fix.

109,1d5dkyi,AITA for telling my tenant she’s nasty and being angry I was given no notice? ,"I have a home that I rent rooms out in and my tenants generally live in the rooms for the remainder of their lease. Sometimes they do break their lease, and as a landlord I am usually upset when they do because it leaves no time for me to rent to a new tenant and the rooms could be empty for months, which would cost us lots of money lost. 

In our home, our roommates do cleaning once a month for the bathroom since it is shared and I have my tenant who hasn't cleaned it not once this month. She cleaned it last month, but not this month. We asked her to clean it, and she said she would when she got off work, however she never did. She just showered and went to bed.

She also stated that she didn't need to pay back the deposit that we agreed to use towards rent. 

I argued with her and told her that she's practically nasty. She left curly hairs in the shared bathroom and the bathroom trash filled with tissue. She said that I would always turn down the tv when she talks on the phone, thati  eavesdrops on her conversations, that I have too many rules, like requiring room checks for cleaning or requiring that she doesn't do laundry past a certain time.

111,1d5dd4q,AITA for calling my mom lazy and entitled?,"I recently graduated and my mom practically begged me to come home for the summer. I spent my undergrad summers on campus for research or travelling, so I said okay. I quickly remembered why I stopped coming home. My mom likes to pretend she misses her kids, when really all she misses is the free labor she can force us to do. I cannot have even a second of peace without being ordered to do something. The laundry, the dishes, cleaning the kitchen, the bathrooms, the dining room, etc. It's always something.

She is the biggest source of mess in the house. Everyone else cleans their plates after use. She just piles them in the sink and tells me or my siblings to do the dishes when it gets too full of her crap. Same with the kitchen, she'll cook for herself, leave pots and spices out, make huge messes, and leave it for someone else to clean up. Meanwhile, All she ever does is sleep, party, and eat. And make messes. I am not surprised, considering this is the same woman who has openly admitted that her primary purpose for having kids was to have people to do the shit she can't be bothered to. But I am not a maid, nor do I take kindly to being treated like one.

It took less than a month for me to get sick of it. She told me to do her laundry and I announced right then and there that I would be moving to the city my MD program is in much earlier than planned. I'm willing to bet this woman has never done mine or my siblings laundry a day in her life, certainly not a day past infancy. If indentured servitude is a requirement for housing, I'll find my own accommodations.

She flipped her shit, telling me I couldn't go and that I was selfish for leaving because she works night shifts and needs help around the house, blah blah blah. She's married. Ask your husband. Or higher help. She acts like she's ever done anything other than the bare minimum of putting food on the table and clothes on my back. 

I told her to get off her lazy ass and to do her own dirty work instead of bringing me in to clean up after her. Then I called her a user because she only ever speaks to me when she wants me to do something for her. The argument got heated and my dad broke it up. Neither of them is talking to me, and I've had 3 family members call to tell me how much of a selfish brat I am. My dad's opinion I don't really care about, he stopped daring to take my side a long time ago. But one of my aunts that called is usually pretty level headed and impartial, despite being my mom's sister, and she ended up chewing me out pretty badly. AITA for believing sucking on a woman's nipple after being forced to exist does not entitle her to free labor for the rest of my adult life?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-01,"AITA for calling my mom lazy and entitled? I recently graduated and my mom practically begged me to come home for the summer. I spent my undergrad summers on campus for research or travelling, so I said okay. I quickly remembered why I stopped coming home. My mom likes to pretend she misses her kids, when really all she misses is the free labor she can force us to do. I cannot have even a second of peace without being ordered to do something. The laundry, the dishes, cleaning the kitchen, the bathrooms, the dining room, etc. It's always something.

She is the biggest source of mess in the house. Everyone else cleans their plates after use. She just piles them in the sink and tells me or my siblings to do the dishes when it gets too full of her crap. Same with the kitchen, she'll cook for herself, leave pots and spices out, make huge messes, and leave it for someone else to clean up. Meanwhile, All she ever does is sleep, party, and eat. And make messes. I am not surprised, considering this is the same woman who has openly admitted that her primary purpose for having kids was to have people to do the shit she can't be bothered to. But I am not a maid, nor do I take kindly to being treated like one.

It took less than a month for me to get sick of it. She told me to do her laundry and I announced right then and there that I would be moving to the city my MD program is in much earlier than planned. I'm willing to bet this woman has never done mine or my siblings laundry a day in her life, certainly not a day past infancy. If indentured servitude is a requirement for housing, I'll find my own accommodations.

She flipped her shit, telling me I couldn't go and that I was selfish for leaving because she works night shifts and needs help around the house, blah blah blah. She's married. Ask your husband. Or higher help. She acts like she's ever done anything other than the bare minimum of putting food on the table and clothes on my back. 

I told her to get off her lazy ass and to do her own dirty work instead of bringing me in to clean up after her. Then I called her a user because she only ever speaks to me when she wants me to do something for her. The argument got heated and my dad broke it up.

112,1d5d22s,WIBTA for telling my husband that I am not moving,"For context, I work full time and I have been living in my current location for a long time. My husband is a transplant here and we met and immediately hit it off. We have been married for a few years and already have a few kids. Now my issue is he keeps wanting to move. It’s a constant thing that is brought up, but it’s always to different states. I’m very happy where I live. He works long hours, and often times throughout the week I see him for MAYBE 10 minutes a day. Because of his late nights, I’ll invite my friends or family over for dinner so I don’t feel so lonely, and I can get a bit of help with our kiddos. I do bedtime routines, I make all of our meals, and I also have an established career here. I don’t want to move because I will completely lose my entire support system, and I will have to start over with my job, where as he would be able to do a lateral transfer. I don’t want to move away from everyone I love, but I don’t know how to make my partner understand that a move (especially while our kids are still young) just isn’t happening.

113,1d5d0ml,AITA for ruining my moms birthday,"I F18 have three sisters 20, 14, and 12. My younger sisters and I live with our mom while my older sister lives at collage. Our mom is a single mom because our dad died a few years ago, she was a stay at home wife. When dad died we all sort of questioned what would happen financially but were not that worried as my dad had a high paying job so we were able to collect most of his saving and money but not all of it. We have been living comfortably but theres no real income because is able to not work for now. 

My mom is schizophrenic and a religious Christian. She is high functioning. But it caused her to get arrested 4 times for harassing a guy who she believed was her soulmate.

Today I heard my mom on the phone, I figured out she's about to pay someone's rent deposit. She met a couple from Ukraine at her church who are refugees and they need to pay a one year rent fee but do not have the funds to atm, my mom offered to pay it as they promised to pay her back slowly because apparently they'll be able to make 6k a month once they start working more. I get that they are new here but I'm wondering why are they renting a place that they really can't afford? 

I confronted her and lost my shit, I started telling her we are not in the position to be lending people large amounts of money like that She kept saying that theres nothing to worry about, that they will pay it back because they are people of god and she trusts them, that she's not stupid. That made me more mad and I told her that she's literally crazy bc she has schizophrenia, this made her more mad. She then screamed at me to get on my knees and say sorry to her god which I did not do because I'd feel like an actual idiot getting on my knees like that. She screamed more while I also too. She said she wouldn't support me anymore, I asked but you'll support random church people and she said yes. 

Texted my older sister, and she was pissed off which is not usual especially at our mom because they are super close. My older sister is extremely mad, ""widowed mother of 4 who has never worked since getting married"" giving away 16k is not an easy amount to give away.

My moms birthday tomorrow and my older sister was supposed to come home but she says she doesn't wanna see our mom and will not be coming home. My mom is blaming me saying things like ""thank you very much with what you did, and tomorrows my birthday."" She's saying how we think money is more important than her which is not fair to say and not true we're just aware to not be stupid with it, she's also said religion is first for her than her kids to out face. She's a good mom overall besides when it comes to her religion. But yeah I'm sitting in my room feeling kind of guilty because tomorrow is her birthday and I ruined it all and made everyone mad at her, it's gonna be the first where we are not all together on someones birthday, but I also feel like I had a right to get angry with what she's doing.
