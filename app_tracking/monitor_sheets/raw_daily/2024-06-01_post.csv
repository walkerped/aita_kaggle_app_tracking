2,1d5qit1,AITA for yelling at my mum for going though all my belongings after I went on holiday for a week,"I (FtM 19) just got back from a 6 day holiday at my grandparents house and upon entering my bedroom found that my mother (59F) went though all of my bedroom drawers and threw stuff away or rearranged them. 

I’m autistic, so people moving my stuff is irritating, not to mention I’d been on a train for around 4 hours returning home.
I’m specifically mad because she chucked away a package I hadn’t opened yet that cost £30, that I had bought for my friend.

I asked her where the package was as she acted like she didn’t have a clue. My mother has a habit of throwing away my stuff and telling me she doesn’t know where it is, only for me to later find out that she chucked it away.

Obviously I was pissed because I’d only been gone a few days, so I started yelling at her. She responded by threatening to call the police on me to which I just went back to my bedroom and cried because I was so overstimulated.

I don’t feel bad for my reaction but she’s acting like it’s the end of the world.

3,1d5g8i7,AITA Monthly Open Forum June 2024: Assholes ASSemble!,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

We’ve been diving into various sub rules lately. So we thought we’d take a break this month, and revisit something we did in an earlier open forum. Hence, the call to ASSemble! (We had a few names that we were throwing around. ASS (Assholes Sharing Stories), Asshole Amnesty Month.

Tell us about a time when you were the asshole. We can relax *some* sub rules a bit (a revenge story is probably fine, since you’re recalling, and not asking for judgment). But, other sub rules still apply (no violent encounters, for example)! Let us know about a time when you knew you were the asshole. Maybe you didn’t mean to be, but after the encounter, you realized you were TA. Or, maybe you knew what you were doing, and went through with it anyway! 

Personally, I've always felt the more low-stakes the issue, the better. Those are always my favorite AITA stories, but feel free to share whatever you may have. And most important - have fun with it!

4,1d5csoh,AITA for yelling at my husband for bringing animals home? ,"My (29F) husband (55M) is the kind of person who grew up in a house with wealthy parents who believed that their luxurious house was no place to keep ""dirty animals"", so he never had a pet until he was at least 27 years old. And since then he loves animals and I love them too and for a while I dedicated myself to helping him foster dogs or cats that he rescued, or that were abandoned at his clinic (he is a veterinarian) but lately I'm feeling overwhelmed, because he brings animals home all the time and I'm already tired of it. 

Last night a person came to his clinic and abandoned a dog and her three puppies and he brought them home, the same house where we already have 6 dogs and 3 cats !!!! I told him we couldn't keep them and he said yes, that these will be the last (he says that all the time) and I lost my composure a little and I yelled at him that I'm tried of him because he always says the same thing, and he said that he is the one who takes care of them and invests money in them and that I'm overreacting. That when I met him he already had many animals and that I shouldn't be surprised that he still has many. 

I didn't tell him anything because unfortunately he's right, when we met he had at least five dogs. So I didn't answer him anything and I was angry for a few hours until he apologized and said that if I don't want them at home he is going to find them a foster family, and of course our children (9M, 8M, 6F, 5F, 3M, 1F) started crying and saying that they want to keep them. 

We live on a farm where we have A LOT of space and having many animals is not a problem, also money is not a problem either so we could keep them if we wanted but I don't know, I personally feel that having so many children and so many animals is sometimes overwhelming but it is not the end of the world either.

5,1d5cqer,WIBTA for asking my out of town friend to not to bring her husband when she comes for my baby shower?,"Some family is throwing me a baby shower next week but it is being held at my house because we have the most space to accommodate guests and parking. The baby shower is ladies only  (my husband will not even be there).

I have a couple of friends who are attending from out of town and have planned to stay over the night before to avoid several hours of driving the day of. 

One of these friends has a husband and one year old. The original plan was for just her to come and stay over the night before, but now she doesn’t want to be away from them for the 24 hours she would be over, so she is talking about bringing them with her. She doesn’t want to bring the baby alone, and she doesn’t want to leave the baby with dad for the weekend. She reluctantly suggested they could get a hotel, but I don’t think they actually will since they quite literally just drained their bank account this week on a huge purchase. If they actually do follow through with a hotel, I know her husband will still want to hang around our house with my friend most of the time outside of the shower itself. My friend knows the shower is ladies only, she says he would just watch the baby elsewhere while the shower is happening. I think she is viewing this as a chance for us all to visit and catch up on utside of the shower, but it will be such a busy weekend with a ton of other people around. This is really not what we have time for that weekend.

I told her in no uncertain terms that I understand if she cannot make it because they have a lot going on, but she is adamant she is coming. 

I have nothing against her husband, but it’s a ladies only event, and my husband and I are already feeling the stress of getting the house and yard party ready without the addition of hosting her husband and baby for the weekend as well while we’re preparing.

I am sympathetic because she is still a new mom, but if she cannot come to the shower without bringing her husband and son over for the whole weekend, I’d rather she sit this one out.

7,1d5cb9a,AITA for embarrassing my cousin and her friend after their ballet preformance?,"So basically, back in January, my cousin had a ballet performance and after it ended my family and her family went to stand by the exit/entrance of the building.

Usually my cousin and I hang out a lot, and we make some racist/sexist jokes about our own race. And I usually have a hard time of talking about something relative or interesting when I meet other people. Like my friend's other friend, for an example.

Anyway, when my cousin came down and met up with my family, her father gave her flowers and she was hanging out with some of her ballet friends. One in particular, I used to be acquaintances with because we used to go to the same High School together.

I assumed her friend also liked the jokes that I say with my cousin, but when I said one about Arabs (me and my cousin are arab) everything was dead silent.

Later when we left and got in her van to go home, I over heard her and her mom arguing (I'm guessing she told her mom about what I said) and then my cousin looked at me and said ""You ruined my night! Thanks a lot!""

When we got to her house, I went to the guest bedroom I was staying in and I couldn't sleep the whole night because I felt bad for saying that.

I still feel bad for saying that infront of her and her friend.

TLDR; Made a joke infront of my cousins friend after their ballet performance thinking her friend would find it funny, but it was dead silence after that.

I now watch my niece fulltime for free(and have since she was 2 months now being 16months). My sister in law (23 female) is fully aware of the trips we have taken to the fertility clinic and the money we have poured into this. I love caring for my niece, even on days when i am sick as a dog she’s my little buddy and sits on her little potty mocking me in the moments i need to spend some extra time in the bathroom till I’m all done. 

I love my sister in law too but she’s not outwardly gracious. Today we were sitting with family (after i had watched her all day from the time she woke up till her mommy got off work) and i was telling my sister in law about a video i saw of this finger painting craft i was going todo with my niece, so monday we’d have a gift for mommy! My sister in law said ‘no she’s not allowed’ and when i asked why not (and not rudely, this infertile auntie is continuously thanking god when i get the best cuddles during nap time from this darling child god and my sister in law let me spend time with lol). My sister in law told me ‘You know IF you ever have a child you’ll understand’. 

I was immediately insulted, embarrassed, and disgusted. I think ‘excuse me?’ Came out of my mouth afterwards. I mean it was just a hand&foot print painting and i was going to let her daughter give it to her as a gift; a time killer during the day for me and babygirl and a keepsake for momma (you know like the ones daycare does for parents)

She literally didn’t respond, a few seconds pass and my niece come up to me with her little Barbie and starts whining and pulling me to her pile of toys and my sister in law (not paying attention to me walking over there with her) says ‘is auntie being mean to you’ my husband chimes in at this point telling her to stop picking on me. 

At some point before we left she did say he was grateful that i watch her daughter for her…. But AITA for being fucking pissed she threw the ‘IF you have a child’ line in my face for asking her why out of all activities i can’t do a finger painting with her daughter. 


*edit to add: would love some ideas on how to handle this relationship, she often down plays my roll and just kinda picks on me in regard to her kid.

My sister in law said ‘no she’s not allowed’ and when i asked why not (and not rudely, this infertile auntie is continuously thanking god when i get the best cuddles during nap time from this darling child god and my sister in law let me spend time with lol). My sister in law told me ‘You know IF you ever have a child you’ll understand’. 

I was immediately insulted, embarrassed, and disgusted. I think ‘excuse me?’ Came out of my mouth afterwards. I mean it was just a hand&foot print painting and i was going to let her daughter give it to her as a gift; a time killer during the day for me and babygirl and a keepsake for momma (you know like the ones daycare does for parents)

She literally didn’t respond, a few seconds pass and my niece come up to me with her little Barbie and starts whining and pulling me to her pile of toys and my sister in law (not paying attention to me walking over there with her) says ‘is auntie being mean to you’ my husband chimes in at this point telling her to stop picking on me. 

At some point before we left she did say he was grateful that i watch her daughter for her…. But AITA for being fucking pissed she threw the ‘IF you have a child’ line in my face for asking her why out of all activities i can’t do a finger painting with her daughter. 


*edit to add: would love some ideas on how to handle this relationship, she often down plays my roll and just kinda picks on me in regard to her kid. I don’t want to undermine her as the parent but a bored toddler is a terrorizing toddler. Help this worn out auntie please!",0.0,-0.0006294169,0,1
10,1d5bh0l,AITA for not cooking after my fiancé defrosted the wrong type of chicken?,"AITA 

EDIT: bcuz I forgot to add this part and a lot of you are tripping out about asking him to help with anything when he gets home from work. The job my fiancé has is very “easy”- (his words not mine) He openly brags about how easy his job is to all his friends & how all he does is drive and give clean uniforms and hand towels. He does not do physical labor. 

I am a SAHM of 3… my fiancé works Monday thru Friday his regular job where he has to go to different restaurants/establishments to drop off things. He’s given free food from said places everyday. (He’s always telling me what he was given for free so I know it’s literally at least 4 out of 5 days he goes to this job.) I barely get to eat during the day bcuz the kids never let me get a minute to myself. As soon as I go to even think about eating one of my kids start crying or needing me. Today I asked him to get a specific type of chicken out of the deep freezer and put it to defrost so I can cook dinner. After about an hour or so of the chicken defrosting I go to the kitchen to see if it’s ready to be seasoned and cooked & it’s the wrong type of chicken. AFTER I SPECIFICALLY TOLD HIM WHICH ONES TO GET OUT. My whole mood is thrown off- I don’t even want to cook anymore & he wants to know why I have an attitude. I just feel like he does certain things on purpose. Weaponized incompetence???? Like why can’t he do anything the right way the first time I ask? Why do I feel like I cant even ask him to do a simple favor like taking specific meat out the freezer without having to hover over him to make sure he’s doing what I actually asked and not what he “thought he heard” 🙄 
Am I the asshole for snapping at him when he tried to act like it was no big deal? To me it is a big deal bcuz it’s EVERY SINGLE TIME I ask him to help me do anything I feel like he purposely does the task wrong 🤦🏻‍♀️

The point of me bringing up that he gets free food all day is bcuz I don’t think he understands how hungry I actually am when he gets home & I actually get a chance to eat bcuz he gets to eat all day at work without kids interrupting his meals. So when I want something specific I want that & that only. So AITA?

For those who will say I could’ve gotten it out myself- yes your right I should’ve gotten it out myself earlier in the day- but it slipped my mind dealing with the kids & I was busy with the kids when I asked him to get the chicken from the freezer. 



UPDATE: I cooked dinner. & took peoples advice on how to speak to him about it. Even tho I have done this before I did it again and used every type of open communication as I could and thought we were moving in a new direction. Our 2 year old nonverbal autistic son is sick right now- another reason I am overwhelmed. And has had a high fever all day I’ve been trying to combat with Tylenol and keeping him hydrated and comfy. I try again to see if I can ask him to do one thing & see if it’ll be done correctly. I asked him to get our sons sippy cup and fill it with some PEDIALYTE while I check him temperature again to see if it’s went down any. As I’m putting our son back in bed with his sippy cup (only the top is see thru) I see milk & I ask him “hey babe what’s in here?” And he says “ensure like you told me to put” so all of yall calling ME the asshole, absolutely not.

11,1d5bbqv,AITA for telling my husband I don't want to go hang out with him and his brother anymore?,"My husband (26M) and I (21F) haven't been married even one year yet. He works long hours Monday-Thursday (construction) and I work scattered 12 hour shifts (hospital). When he is able to work short days on the days I have off, we try and go on small dates rather than just staying at home.

In the last couple of months, his brother (30M) has called every almost every other day asking to go do something. I'm usually okay with doing stuff with my husband's family because I think it's good to have a healthy relationship with each other's family's. Recently it just feels like we are constantly doing stuff only with his though. I rarely go to see my family because they live 30 minutes away and are usually  busy with sports (as that is what we were raised doing during the summer) or taking care of farm animals.

Just within the last month, my husband and his brother have gone out several times (me tagging along half the time) while I've only had my brother (13M) tagging along once. My husband and I have not gone on an actual date with just us in over a month at least.

I was very excited to go out today since I had the day off and my husband was working a shorter day. I got all dressed up in nicer clothes but my husband's brother called just before we left to see if he wanted to go ride dirt bikes. My husband agreed to go but I was extremely disappointed and said no. When my husband hung up and asked why, I told him it was because I didn't want to go hang out with his brother again. He told me I should have said something while he was on the phone but we had already talked and agreed about going out a couple hours earlier and his brother had been on speaker. I continued on to tell him we need to move further away from both our families to which he didn't reply other than to argue ""what would we even do?""

13,1d5azes,AITAH for beating my brother at a game,"I know this isn't big, but I don't know what to do. My brother and I are quite close and have one thing in common. We both have a love for gaming. We found as a way to get away from it all and just have fun. It would sometimes get emotional and we would only ever have small arguements, but that was it. I am 15 M and he is 14 M. We both got a VR headset each for Christmas and we enjoyed games like Superhot, Bonelab, but most importantly, Gorilla Tag. If you aren't familiar with the game, I'll give a short explanation now. It is a game where you are a gorilla and you use your arms to transport yourself around the maps and play multiple gamemodes like Infection, Hunt, Paintball, or hang out with strangers in Casual. Anyway, recently, I found a parody of the game where it was the same mechanics but its map, characters anf cosmetics are made entirely of LEGO. I thought this was a fun idea, so I downloaded the game. I played the game for a while and my brother saw. He asked me if I was playing Gorilla Tag but I told him I was playing Brick Tag. I asked him if he wanted to join and he said yes. For context, I am better than him at the game and have a better understanding of the games mechanics. We played a few matches in a private code, but whenever I was the tagger I would win quickly. If I wasn't the tagger, I would barely lose. My brother found it unfair but didn't seem too angry so I decided to give him an advantage by only playing with one arm to make it harder for me. But I soon found out that it didn't help him at all and I kept myself away from and never got tagged. After about 10 minutes of not being tagged and my brother chasing me, he took off his headset and sulked in a chair. I asked him what was wrong and he replied saying that he found it unfair that I was so much better than him and did things that he couldn't do. I said that it was just natural for me as I was used to playing at that level. He stayed in the chair sulking and wasn't having it. I decided to go to my room and give him some space. I have no idea what to do because I want to keep playing but I will find the game boring if I played slower.
