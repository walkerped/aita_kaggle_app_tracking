0,1d6cng4,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to meet my mum after my grandparents said me and my dad weren’t real family?,"
Here is an update to what happened after I made my post. The post is on my profile.

After I cooled down from that day, I thought it over and I read all your comments. So I decided to keep talking to my mum and maybe not my grandparents anymore.

Then I talked to my dad about it and he told me that when my mum and dad were dating, her parents disapproved of him because he was poorer and his mum was a single mum. My mum’s family is kind of classist and didn’t like him so during that time they treated him badly. So that’s why he doesn’t like my mums parents and he still hates my mum for never making contact.

He called my mum and told her that she could continue to see me once a month but I wouldn’t meet her parents at all and she wouldn’t fetch me to school. My mum said ok and now everything has blown over. She apologised to my dad and me and now he’s  trying to tolerate her more. 

I’m trying to be less mad at my mum because I think she is trying harder. And im trying to show my dad that I appreciate him more for all that he’s done for me. Thank u for all your advice on what to do! Some of you seemed curious to know what would happen, so here you go. Sorry if im updating wrong im not really clear of the format.

1,1d68v8d,WIBTA for leaving my family without a warning?,"me (m20) and my parents have always had a rocky relationship but for the last year it’s been really bad. there was a situation in which i was exposed to them as being trans and dating another trans person, which was terrifying because they’re severely homophobic. i ended up having to just swear on everything i could and beg them to believe me over the random man that contacted them. my father decided that the best way to stop this all from happening was keeping me on house arrest and only allowing me to go to work and school, i couldn’t see any of my friends or go out without either them or one of my siblings with me. 

I did find a way around this where i lied about my work and school schedule so i could see my boyfriend and friends without their knowledge. and so far this has been working out well for me, but my parents have started to become suspicious. my mother often asks me and my sister if i am lying but we both lie and say that i’m not so i can keep the freedom i made for myself. my father has requested to see my work schedule so he knows what days and when i work so he can track me. i obviously did not give it to him and generally just avoid being around him and interacting with him.

in december i was planning to move out without any of them knowing. i packed as much as i could without it being suspicious and was going to disappear after work. what ended up happening was i texted my mom a gigantic paragraph of how i was feeling and what i was doing so she at least knew i was safe. this ended up being a bad decision because she started crying and begging me to come home, saying she was going to pass away if i did this. ultimately i went back after she promised me she would help get my dad to reduce his punishment. her help did little to nothing as she can’t stand up to my dad. 

the predicament that i’m in now is i don’t know if i would be an asshole for leaving them out of nowhere or if it’s the right thing to do for my mental health. i’ve already moved the majority of my stuff into my boyfriends house so all that’s left now is for me to grab the little stuff i have left and leave. i don’t know whether i should notify them days before i do it or just up and leave. i would obviously leave a letter or send a text saying that i moved out and am safe and i’m not cutting them out of my life i just can’t live with them. i would need to turn my phone off for a little while because i know my parents would blow up my phone and guilt me into coming back. i’m terrified of what my father would do if he ended up finding me after i left.

there’s a lot of details that i’ve left out or glossed over because i don’t want to make this too long, but all in all my parents have just made me go into a downwards spiral. so would i be an asshole for leaving ?

2,1d62ni9,AITA for telling my sister to rethink her approach?,"Throwaway account because my sister is familiar with the subreddit. I, 30 yo man, and my sister, 24 yo woman, have always had similar opinions. It is very evident when we discuss AITA stories. That is until it comes to family dynamics. Hence why I decided to post this here to get outside POVs. For context, I'm in med school doing rotations in my hometown hospital and she just started a new marketing job a year ago. I've been living with my parents for the past year to save on housing and she has never moved out. Having lived this year together again has resurface lots of issues, like her not being the most clean/organized person to live with. Her room is basically a collection of dirty laundry mixed with clean, trash, and various soiled personal items not thrown away. Although a very good cook (several family members are, including myself), she again is not organized in the kitchen. I cook/clean as I go to avoid pile up and she usually just piles everything high to clean it later insisting she will eventually get to it.  
I explain all this because her birthday is coming up and has decided to host a brunch/pool party at the house. Mom quickly offered to help even suggesting catering to avoid kitchen hassle. She said it wouldn't be necessary as it would only be a small party with close friends/family and she would be cooking herself. It wouldn't be until later when the guest list got to 30 guests, including her BF's parents (who haven't met our parents yet) and a work acquaintance of mom who sis is close with, that things took a turn.   
Mom once again offered help, but sis was adamant that she would handle it. Mom, knowing well how sis is organizing/keeping things clean, wasn't happy about it this being the first time the BF's parents would visit and she wanting to make a good impression. She also has always kept personal and work life separate hence why the acquaintance invite worried her as she is also her superior. Arguments escalated and now both are extremely angry at each other with mom even starting to cry due to harsh words being exchanged.   
I had just arrived from weekend rounding at the hospital when I stumble in the middle of this mess. My schedule is pretty grueling and the last thing I want is a hostile environment when I still have to finish paperwork/study/take care of myself/maintain a LD relationship. I've gotten used to these arguments over the past year, them being very common back in the day. Grown tired from grinning and bearing, I called sis and told her to rethink her approach and try to see thing from mom's POV. She immediately got defensive and after trying to get her to see reason hung up on me and hasn't called or texted since.  
IMO, she is being inconsiderate and disrespectful to our mom who is still willing to continue with the party and is only trying to give her more time for guests and for a disaster to be avoided.

3,1d62eju,AITA for trying to surprise my husband when he didn’t want to?,"My (F31) husband just turned 32. I planned a spa treatment for him and a fun activity with our group of friends. I booked his calendar but didn’t mention what it was. When he say the invite, he said I don’t want surprises, what are we doing? I said I’m taking to a spa then we have an activity with our group I didn’t mention what the activity would be because it’s very original and we never did something like that. It was a trivia game activity in a real-like game show setting, I also personnalized name tags for everyone with fun nicknames, I also paid extra to have personalized questions about him as part of the game. I didn’t want to spoil it and wanted to have a reveal on the day of. He didn’t insist on knowing the activity. 
On the day of, like 3 hours before, he asked again and mentioned I don’t want surprises. I told him there is no surprise in the sense of you know who is coming and you know that it will be a group activity. He said he doesn’t want a surprise  and he wants to know. It was not out impatience or curiosity. It was out of « I dont want to be surprised and it doesn’t matter to me I will still enjoy it just the same » but in pressing  and annoyed manner. I ended up crying because I’ve put a lot of effort into this and he just decided to insist a few hours before not the first time I mentioned the activity.  I told him everything and we had a fight about it. He says it seems like I’m making it about me.

Edit to add: we all LOVE game nights with our friends. We love trivia, we enjoy it’s not an activity I came up with just for myself. In fact, it’s my friend who suggested this place and we all came up with the nicknames for the tags together. We were all very excited to show him that we found a real life spot to play games we play in our living room usually. So I have no need from recognition from my friends as they were all involved. 
I also did not go out of my way to create questions about him. It was an option they offer for birthdays and bachelorettes etc. It was silly questions such as what age did he turn today ? It was just for fun and nothing embarrassing or difficult. 
He is not ANTI surprises. He was surprised before maaaany times for his birthday (not just by me) and enjoyed it. he just said this year I don’t want a surprise.

4,1d626dk,WIBTA If I backed out of a Bach party ,"I [29f] was invited to a bachelorette weekend in September. I was asked by the maid of honor what weekends do/don’t work for me, not if I was able to travel (or even wanted to.
To be honest I was surprised I was invited at ll, as the bride- a former college roommate- was the roommate I was least close to.)
But I was caught off guard and gave my availability and like 3 days later I’m hit with a “great here’s the weekend and air bnb, Venmo me $300 pls.”

Thing is, I really don’t want to go. I dread it every time I think of it. I have limited vacation time and I’m the only person flying in from out of state. I’d rather spend that money flying to see my parents during my daughters school break so they can help me with childcare and I don’t have to burn through *all* my vacation time (I work remote).

Would I be the AH if I backed out of the bach weekend just because I don’t want to go? Even after committing? I think I might seem more assholeish because I already traveled to a mutual friends bach weekend (MUCH closer to me and everyone was coming from out of state) and that was harder for me because I was pumping the whole time and away from baby for the first time overnight so it might look like I just don’t care about this friend as much.
I honestly don’t even care if I get my money back for the air bnb, it’s not nothing but it’s not nearly as much as the airfare to get there, not to mention I’d probably visit my parents regardless so there’s that airfare too.

5,1d61j69,AITA for no visiting my girlfriend in the hospital?,"My girlfriend (20F) and I (19M)are in the midst of a terrible argument. I dropped her off at work from her house (half hour away). At work my girlfriend’s stomach was hurting very badly, more than any other stomach ache. I was at her house and I was about to go leave to go home to go to the gym and get my sister from her event. I texted her throughout her shift to make sure she’s ok. 

Before I leave her house she tells me to wait a bit because she might get off early because of her stomach ache. I tell her okay, but then she tells me to leave and go home. She says she’s going to push it through and try to finish her shift. I start driving to my house which is half an hour away.

Once I get home she calls telling me she’s going to get off work early and she’s in a lot of pain. I ask her if she wants me to pick her up and she keeps saying no. I insist I pick her up and head my way to her but she keeps saying no.

For context we have this code word that means we are absolutely serious. She uses that code word and I turn my car around to go home, and she wants to uber instead.

Then she gets upset with me because i’m not picking her up; I should be doing it no matter what she says. She starts saying that I never listen and don’t care about her and now she’s on the bathroom floor in pain and then says we shouldn’t be together (break up).

I give her a text saying I’m not coming over, I’m picking up my sister, and I need a break for a bit.

I go to the gym after I pick up my sister.

She eventually goes to the hospital because her stomach ache is getting really bad, and i give her a call to make sure she’s okay and see if she doesn’t have anything serious. (her mom has been updating me)

Then she texts me and says that the gym is really more important than her and how her coworkers talked about how her boyfriend (me) would already be at the hospital waiting for her and it made her feel like shit because I wasn’t. How I wasn’t there for her when she is in the hospital.

Just tried to kindly bring it up and it was met with “you’re worse than me”…like no. I know how it makes me feel so I would never do that to you.
