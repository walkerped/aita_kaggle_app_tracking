0,1d6cng4,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to meet my mum after my grandparents said me and my dad weren’t real family?,"
Here is an update to what happened after I made my post. The post is on my profile.

After I cooled down from that day, I thought it over and I read all your comments. So I decided to keep talking to my mum and maybe not my grandparents anymore.

Then I talked to my dad about it and he told me that when my mum and dad were dating, her parents disapproved of him because he was poorer and his mum was a single mum. My mum’s family is kind of classist and didn’t like him so during that time they treated him badly. So that’s why he doesn’t like my mums parents and he still hates my mum for never making contact.

He called my mum and told her that she could continue to see me once a month but I wouldn’t meet her parents at all and she wouldn’t fetch me to school. My mum said ok and now everything has blown over. She apologised to my dad and me and now he’s  trying to tolerate her more. 

I’m trying to be less mad at my mum because I think she is trying harder. And im trying to show my dad that I appreciate him more for all that he’s done for me. Thank u for all your advice on what to do! Some of you seemed curious to know what would happen, so here you go. Sorry if im updating wrong im not really clear of the format.

1,1d68v8d,WIBTA for leaving my family without a warning?,"me (m20) and my parents have always had a rocky relationship but for the last year it’s been really bad. there was a situation in which i was exposed to them as being trans and dating another trans person, which was terrifying because they’re severely homophobic. i ended up having to just swear on everything i could and beg them to believe me over the random man that contacted them. my father decided that the best way to stop this all from happening was keeping me on house arrest and only allowing me to go to work and school, i couldn’t see any of my friends or go out without either them or one of my siblings with me. 

I did find a way around this where i lied about my work and school schedule so i could see my boyfriend and friends without their knowledge. and so far this has been working out well for me, but my parents have started to become suspicious. my mother often asks me and my sister if i am lying but we both lie and say that i’m not so i can keep the freedom i made for myself. my father has requested to see my work schedule so he knows what days and when i work so he can track me. i obviously did not give it to him and generally just avoid being around him and interacting with him.

in december i was planning to move out without any of them knowing. i packed as much as i could without it being suspicious and was going to disappear after work. what ended up happening was i texted my mom a gigantic paragraph of how i was feeling and what i was doing so she at least knew i was safe. this ended up being a bad decision because she started crying and begging me to come home, saying she was going to pass away if i did this. ultimately i went back after she promised me she would help get my dad to reduce his punishment. her help did little to nothing as she can’t stand up to my dad. 

the predicament that i’m in now is i don’t know if i would be an asshole for leaving them out of nowhere or if it’s the right thing to do for my mental health. i’ve already moved the majority of my stuff into my boyfriends house so all that’s left now is for me to grab the little stuff i have left and leave. i don’t know whether i should notify them days before i do it or just up and leave. i would obviously leave a letter or send a text saying that i moved out and am safe and i’m not cutting them out of my life i just can’t live with them. i would need to turn my phone off for a little while because i know my parents would blow up my phone and guilt me into coming back. i’m terrified of what my father would do if he ended up finding me after i left.

there’s a lot of details that i’ve left out or glossed over because i don’t want to make this too long, but all in all my parents have just made me go into a downwards spiral. so would i be an asshole for leaving ?

2,1d62ni9,AITA for telling my sister to rethink her approach?,"Throwaway account because my sister is familiar with the subreddit. I, 30 yo man, and my sister, 24 yo woman, have always had similar opinions. It is very evident when we discuss AITA stories. That is until it comes to family dynamics. Hence why I decided to post this here to get outside POVs. For context, I'm in med school doing rotations in my hometown hospital and she just started a new marketing job a year ago. I've been living with my parents for the past year to save on housing and she has never moved out. Having lived this year together again has resurface lots of issues, like her not being the most clean/organized person to live with. Her room is basically a collection of dirty laundry mixed with clean, trash, and various soiled personal items not thrown away. Although a very good cook (several family members are, including myself), she again is not organized in the kitchen. I cook/clean as I go to avoid pile up and she usually just piles everything high to clean it later insisting she will eventually get to it.  
I explain all this because her birthday is coming up and has decided to host a brunch/pool party at the house. Mom quickly offered to help even suggesting catering to avoid kitchen hassle. She said it wouldn't be necessary as it would only be a small party with close friends/family and she would be cooking herself. It wouldn't be until later when the guest list got to 30 guests, including her BF's parents (who haven't met our parents yet) and a work acquaintance of mom who sis is close with, that things took a turn.   
Mom once again offered help, but sis was adamant that she would handle it. Mom, knowing well how sis is organizing/keeping things clean, wasn't happy about it this being the first time the BF's parents would visit and she wanting to make a good impression. She also has always kept personal and work life separate hence why the acquaintance invite worried her as she is also her superior. Arguments escalated and now both are extremely angry at each other with mom even starting to cry due to harsh words being exchanged.   
I had just arrived from weekend rounding at the hospital when I stumble in the middle of this mess. My schedule is pretty grueling and the last thing I want is a hostile environment when I still have to finish paperwork/study/take care of myself/maintain a LD relationship. I've gotten used to these arguments over the past year, them being very common back in the day. Grown tired from grinning and bearing, I called sis and told her to rethink her approach and try to see thing from mom's POV. She immediately got defensive and after trying to get her to see reason hung up on me and hasn't called or texted since.  
IMO, she is being inconsiderate and disrespectful to our mom who is still willing to continue with the party and is only trying to give her more time for guests and for a disaster to be avoided.

I said I’m taking to a spa then we have an activity with our group I didn’t mention what the activity would be because it’s very original and we never did something like that. It was a trivia game activity in a real-like game show setting, I also personnalized name tags for everyone with fun nicknames, I also paid extra to have personalized questions about him as part of the game. I didn’t want to spoil it and wanted to have a reveal on the day of. He didn’t insist on knowing the activity. 
On the day of, like 3 hours before, he asked again and mentioned I don’t want surprises. I told him there is no surprise in the sense of you know who is coming and you know that it will be a group activity. He said he doesn’t want a surprise  and he wants to know.

We were all very excited to show him that we found a real life spot to play games we play in our living room usually. So I have no need from recognition from my friends as they were all involved. 
I also did not go out of my way to create questions about him. It was an option they offer for birthdays and bachelorettes etc. It was silly questions such as what age did he turn today ? It was just for fun and nothing embarrassing or difficult.

4,1d626dk,WIBTA If I backed out of a Bach party ,"I [29f] was invited to a bachelorette weekend in September. I was asked by the maid of honor what weekends do/don’t work for me, not if I was able to travel (or even wanted to.
To be honest I was surprised I was invited at ll, as the bride- a former college roommate- was the roommate I was least close to.)
But I was caught off guard and gave my availability and like 3 days later I’m hit with a “great here’s the weekend and air bnb, Venmo me $300 pls.”

Thing is, I really don’t want to go. I dread it every time I think of it. I have limited vacation time and I’m the only person flying in from out of state. I’d rather spend that money flying to see my parents during my daughters school break so they can help me with childcare and I don’t have to burn through *all* my vacation time (I work remote).

Would I be the AH if I backed out of the bach weekend just because I don’t want to go? Even after committing? I think I might seem more assholeish because I already traveled to a mutual friends bach weekend (MUCH closer to me and everyone was coming from out of state) and that was harder for me because I was pumping the whole time and away from baby for the first time overnight so it might look like I just don’t care about this friend as much.
I honestly don’t even care if I get my money back for the air bnb, it’s not nothing but it’s not nearly as much as the airfare to get there, not to mention I’d probably visit my parents regardless so there’s that airfare too.

5,1d61j69,AITA for no visiting my girlfriend in the hospital?,"My girlfriend (20F) and I (19M)are in the midst of a terrible argument. I dropped her off at work from her house (half hour away). At work my girlfriend’s stomach was hurting very badly, more than any other stomach ache. I was at her house and I was about to go leave to go home to go to the gym and get my sister from her event. I texted her throughout her shift to make sure she’s ok. 

Before I leave her house she tells me to wait a bit because she might get off early because of her stomach ache. I tell her okay, but then she tells me to leave and go home. She says she’s going to push it through and try to finish her shift. I start driving to my house which is half an hour away.

Once I get home she calls telling me she’s going to get off work early and she’s in a lot of pain. I ask her if she wants me to pick her up and she keeps saying no. I insist I pick her up and head my way to her but she keeps saying no.

For context we have this code word that means we are absolutely serious. She uses that code word and I turn my car around to go home, and she wants to uber instead.

Then she gets upset with me because i’m not picking her up; I should be doing it no matter what she says. She starts saying that I never listen and don’t care about her and now she’s on the bathroom floor in pain and then says we shouldn’t be together (break up).

I give her a text saying I’m not coming over, I’m picking up my sister, and I need a break for a bit.

I go to the gym after I pick up my sister.

She eventually goes to the hospital because her stomach ache is getting really bad, and i give her a call to make sure she’s okay and see if she doesn’t have anything serious. (her mom has been updating me)

Then she texts me and says that the gym is really more important than her and how her coworkers talked about how her boyfriend (me) would already be at the hospital waiting for her and it made her feel like shit because I wasn’t. How I wasn’t there for her when she is in the hospital.

7,1d6r0n7,AITA for hiding from my bff that she knows my the guy I like?,"I really do love my best friend. We met first semester of college and have been thick as thieves ever since. We're 21.

She did not have a good time in high school and she's told me about a lot of it. She was bullied for being gay, not-white, etc. She went to a high school that was 99% white kids, so she was signaled out.

She told me that the popular kids, especially, would bully her constantly.

She has spent the last few months studying aboard and that is when I met my new crush. I told her everything about this guy over the phone, and how into him I am, but I never mentioned that they knew each other and went to the same high school, especially because it was really new.

But I am head over heels and am really into this guy, and I think he's so adorable and sweet and cute. I knew he was popular in highschool, though, because I looked through his social media. I was worried he was one of the people that was bullied her. Because she said a lot of people did. 

But I wasn't going to stop me, I really liked him.

But anyway, we're officially together now and my best friend keeps bugging me for a picture so I confessed that they went to the same high school and who it was.

She asked why I didn't tell her before, and I said I was worried he was one of the people that bullied her because its just obvious to me that he was popular in high school (he played football, had a lot of friends, etc.)

She said no, actually, he was this hot, popular guy that never bugged me and minded his own business. She said he was actually always really nice to her whenever they talked and she was really grateful for that at the time.

I was really relieved. But then she asked why I didn't ask before, was I really down to be with someone who bullied her for years?

I told her the truth that high school was a long time ago and I wouldn't let them come between me and someone I want to be with fovever. I told her that I just really like him and I can't let anything stop me.

But she got upset. She said it was fucked up to be with someone that would do that to her and it made me a shitty friend. We argued about it.

But anyway, we're officially together now and my best friend keeps bugging me for a picture so I confessed that they went to the same high school and who it was.

She asked why I didn't tell her before, and I said I was worried he was one of the people that bullied her because its just obvious to me that he was popular in high school (he played football, had a lot of friends, etc.)

She said no, actually, he was this hot, popular guy that never bugged me and minded his own business. She said he was actually always really nice to her whenever they talked and she was really grateful for that at the time.

I was really relieved. But then she asked why I didn't ask before, was I really down to be with someone who bullied her for years?

I told her the truth that high school was a long time ago and I wouldn't let them come between me and someone I want to be with fovever. I told her that I just really like him and I can't let anything stop me.

But she got upset. She said it was fucked up to be with someone that would do that to her and it made me a shitty friend. We argued about it.

8,1d6qxgv,AITA? Am i the asshole in this situation?,"Am i the asshole? So about a year ago now, one of my close friends (we’ll call her Lacey) told me that she had a type of autism. I fully accepted that as it really isn’t a big deal to me and it doesn’t change how i see her. A few months after this i told my then best friend (who we’ll call Kasey) about this and we talked about it for a few minutes then didnt really say anything about it. A further couple of months later, i see all of my friends in town while i’m shopping with my mom and my sister. I go over to them and i say hi, I give them all a hug apart from Kasey as she moves away from me. At the time I presumed it was a joke. I then said to them ‘wait here i’ll ask if i can come with you’ i go back to my mom to ask but before she says yes i turn around to see that they’ve gone out of the shop. It upset me but i thought ‘maybe they didn’t hear me’. Later that day i’m removed from the group chat with the whole friend group on with no explanation. A friend who is on that group chat texts me to tell me that a girl had texted on the group which was effectively ‘we removed her because no one likes her’. I had the screenshots of this as proof. I then message my best friend at the time (Kasey) why i was removed. She lies to me and tells me that everyone was removed because no one used it. We had this whole argument that went no where and ended with her complaining of a ‘headache’ to which i said ‘i’ll text you tomorrow then when ur all better. She then replied ‘unfortunately i’ll have a headache tomorrow too’ i left it there and didn’t say any more. None of them talked to me. I had lost all of them at once. My boyfriend then text my best friend asking what happened and she told him ‘just ask hannah’ but wouldn’t tell me!

It wasnt until about a week after that i had fully realised what had happened. 

My best friend had been hanging out with Lacey (my close friend at the time) and had told her about the fact she knew she had autism because of me. I plucked up the courage a few days later to go up to her and apologise. She was with other people so i didn’t mention what it was about. I stated that i was so sorry and i wasnt expecting forgiveness but that i would like to be part of the group again. While doing so my eyes welled up and i left the room. I waited to hear what i presumed would be at least some pity. But no, they laughed so loudly. All of them laughing at me as i sat outside the room devastated. I have made it clear since then that i was sorry but they all refuse to talk to me and are doing such petty things to me like spreading rumours and posting tiktoks about me.

9,1d6qx04,AITA if i don't clean the common areas in my apartment,"Context: I moved into my current apartment in November of last year, and hastily made my decision to move in because I had been homeless for 3 months. The apartment turned out to be a weird arrangement between sharing the apartment with another renter and my landlord, with her having the living room balcony for herself and her frequent guests (which is right in front of the window to my room? This makes me uncomfortable when she's there and doesn't want to acknowledge me)  
After moving in, I realized that the room is super moldy, and the kitchen is too. Her kitchen is filled with expired food, and she doesn't recycle properly.

When I moved in, I had to get her to cooperate because I'm on welfare and the local welfare agency is strict on which apartments meet the guidelines. This includes documentation of her contract with her and the owners of the building, which she refused to show/lied about not existing. When confronted with multiple questions she is only able to answer with a short reply. She instead showed the contract which her grandfather (who is most likely not alive) had for the apartment. It was extremly difficult to communicate with her about the required papers for welfare to pay the rent, which is quite cheap though (6500 NOK).

I have been mentally ill (PTSD, autism and non-binary lol) for my entire life, and it only got worse 2 years ago. I admit guilt for not cleaning the common areas, but I think the reason is mostly that I'm afraid of her.

Things got worse when the landlord was out of town and her guest decided not to recycle properly, prompting me to emotionally remove the wrongly sorted trash write a note on the cupboard ""please recycle. Boycott sodastream"".  
My landlord did not like this and refused to accept that buying sodastream products are controversial at this time...  
I heard someone sort the trash later, and I asked the other renter if she sorted it, which she did not do. The other renter accused me of accusing her for making a mess and other things, which the landlord also confronted me about, while the landlord misgendered (not the first time) the other renter who is trans and from the Phillippines.

10,1d6qs8b,AITA for not offering more support for my sister after her surgery.,"So I have 4 sisters, the eldest 2 are between 10-13 years older than us younger 3. Unsurprisingly this means that there is something of a distance between us, while #2 made more of an effort to be in our lives when we were growing up and we regularly do activities together, #1 didn't, I was fine with this, we're not really a super close family and only get together for Christmas hosted by my parents. Usually our communication won't extend past a message on our birthdays. Again, that's not the issue here.

  
Let's get into what happened.  My sisters and I, minus #1 were chatting when #2 informed us that #1 was mad at us for not checking up on her after her surgery. For context, we have a family group chat that us younger 3 don't check often unless tagged as it's mostly holiday pics, child updates, day to day activities. Not something we're particularly interested in keeping up to date on.  For anything significant we're told to read it and we do, it's worked like this for years. Unbeknownst to us, #1 had had a Laparoscopy, not a \*major\* surgery but a surgery is a surgery. When I became aware of this I sent her a message to ask how she was doing. I was met with... nothing, which unfortunately was pretty on brand for her. My other siblings received the same treatment. She was making it a point to ignore the messages from us entirely (she was active on the app in different chats so it wasn't like she just hadn't checked the app in a while.)

It wasn't until \*weeks\* later while I was overseas that she finally responded. I asked a few follow up questions, like you do and that was that. A few days later she adds that she heard from the clinic and the cyst they removed was benign, neither I nor anyone else apparently knew they were testing for anything potentially cancerous but I said that was good. Her response was and I quote ""Is that it?"" then ""what would it take to hold your interest lol \[cry laughing emoji\]"" I asked what she wanted from me and at this point in her shoes I'd be tired of going through this same conversation with everyone she knows, (she is very much the type to post hospital bed pictures to all her social media and tell everyone who will listen about any event where she could garner their sympathy). She responded snarkily thanking me for my compassion and that she ""will remember this if you ever have problems"" and then apparently blocked me. I shared this interaction with my other siblings and apparently they responded much like I did (or by their own admission even less) but didn't get this same response. Albeit it may have come across as rather uncaring but she did ignore me for weeks out of spite. Apparently she's been ranting to my other sisters about how I don't care for anyone but myself and what has she done to deserve this cold callousness etc. AMITA?

It started off good, they became very close friends, and eventually she started talking about him to me, complimenting his looks, telling me his eyes were the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, that she loved the sound of his voice, that she just loved everything about him. It wasn't until we graduated high-school and started applying for university's that she told me they had started dating. We all eventually got into the same university, and she would always be with him, or try to atleast. I didnt notice anything out of the normal, until one day my friend called me crying. She was practically having a anxiety attack while telling me she was scared he was going to leave her for another girl. She then continued to tell me how she noticed he would constantly be touchy with other women, ignoring her just to go talk to them. After she finished her breakdown i tried to give her some advice. I told her to talk to him and express her feelings, and that he would probably try to atleast make more time for her, but she then continued to lash out at me and scream at me over the phone, telling me that there was nothing to talk about with him, and that he wouldn't change. Throughout the weeks it would get worse, with her almost twice a week telling me and her other friends that she was going to break uo with him, and that she needed to be independent, but whenever we asked her if she did it she would say it wasn't his fault other girls were flirting with him, and that he didn't have time for her.

Since then I have completely renovated it and gotten a new bed, tv and so on. 
He usually comes back here once a month and stays for some days with his girlfriend and everytime they get back they demand me to give up my room for them, the reason being that I have the bigger bed. Me being me, I always let them have it, just to avoid arguments because they apparently ”don’t feel welcome” unless they get my room. Which I find absolutely crazy because we have another room with a smaller bed where they could easily be instead. My mom also gets very anxious when me and him fight about it so that’s why I give in. 

Five days ago they came back here and of course they got my room and I had to leave my room with all my belongings and settle in the smaller room. But then they left again two days ago to go fishing in another place with some friends. Then they were supposed to go back to his own place, but instead they came back here to sleep for ONE night then head home. 

Now that brings us to today. I was in my room playing video games and since I am free from work tomorrow I felt like gaming late. They come home and demands my room immediately, I argue back that I wont give up my room right now because I dont want to leave the pc. The time at this point is also only 22:00 or 10pm so I want to keep playing. 
And my brother was not having it and went to my parents, now they are all pressuring me to leave the room and I refuse, my brother then threatens that they will leave and go home (to my parents who want’s them to stay). I eventually have to give in and they take my room, but I am not happy.

And my brother was not having it and went to my parents, now they are all pressuring me to leave the room and I refuse, my brother then threatens that they will leave and go home (to my parents who want’s them to stay). I eventually have to give in and they take my room, but I am not happy.

So AITA for refusing to give up my room where I literally have all my stuff, and lets not forget that they are using MY bed, doing God knows what. They also leave a bunch of trash after they leave which I have to clean up.
(Sorry for a little messy text its late and im frustrated)

(EDIT) Forgot to mention that I am 20M and my brother 23M. I also pay 200-250 euro a month for rent.",0.0,0.0360436886548996,0,1
15,1d6p4jy,AITA for not laughing at my sister-in-law making my son cry?,"
My sis-in-law and her husband looked after my 7 year old overnight for the first time a few weeks ago. My son was excited leading up to it as he was going to spend the night staying at ""his favourite uncles house"". The next day my sis-in-law was telling us how funny it was when they made the uncle hide and pretended he'd left for the night. My son took it as a joke for a while and kept saying ""haha no he hasn't"" but they kept it up until ""he had a mini meltdown"" and started crying. They (this was the second sis-in-law who was present) also did this by hiding his Nintendo Switch and pretended they sold it. My sis-in-law was laughing her head off while sat there just looking a bit confused/suprised at what was funny. SIL said something along the lines of ""you don't have to look so traumatised!"" And, knowing how sensitive my wife's side of the family can be, I just replied ""sorry, but I don't find those kind of jokes funny"". SIL then exploded in front of everyone and went on a rant about how she doesn't feel like she can treat my son how she wants and doesn't tell him off how she wants because of me. For context when my son was born he was very premature and in intensive care for the first three weeks so for the first year I absolutely was a bit overprotective and I also got my sis in laws back up when my son fell over when he was three and screamed and I went running over asking if he was ok, even though his other aunt was already there and that one exploded then too shouting that ""she knows how to look after a child!"". Again then I was a bit confused that asking my son who was crying and distressed if he was ok should get such an angry reaction. I'm now paranoid about how I parent in front on my in-laws. So, am I the asshole? Maybe I'm missing something and should see their pov?

Update:
Thanks everyone, I just wanted to check I wasn’t overreacting or losing the plot. 
The aunties are generally very loving and caring just don’t have kids of their own and can obviously be quite immature then get angry if anyone calls out any of their behaviours.

16,1d6p37c,AITA for making a joke about not being gay?,"First real post on this account I think, I only really read reddit posts from YouTube lmao.

So, yesterday my friend posted me on his Instagram story under a stick that said ""gay friend appreciation"". I'm not gay, but I am a person who is very frequently confused for a gay man, even though I'm not (something about me not acting ""manly""?? idfk). This is a very common joke among me and my friends. 

In response to this, I reposted his story saying ""guys i just found im gay?? when were y'all gonna tell me?"" The joke being that I'm not gay, but I found out by this post that I'm reacting with shock and confusion. I thought the joke was pretty straight forward. However, I got a lot of messages from people like ""wait, you're gay?"" and i have to explain it's a joke to them. After that, I posted another story saying ""too many people didn't get the joke. friends im not gay."" 

In response to this, I've gotten like 7 messages calling me a queerbaiter and a couple of people said something along the lines about me ""using pride month for clout"".

I knew he was in a tough spot, so I didn’t hesitate to help him out. However, he never paid me back everything he owed me. He repaid about $200.

Recently, M decided to move and was selling some of his belongings. There was something I was really interested in buying from him, worth about around $280. He sent me the bill for it, but I reminded him that he still owed me and suggested that if he gave me the item for free, we could consider it even.

He agreed to this arrangement, but ever since then, he’s been cold and distant with me. He barely talks to me now, and when he does, it’s very curt and unfriendly.

Most of our mutual friends think I was being reasonable by settling the debt this way since he hadn’t paid me back. But his best friend says I should have just paid for the item and continued to wait for him to repay the loan when he could. 

I feel like I would have never gotten my money back if I had gone that route.

19,1d6o70q,AITA for not inviting my Dad to my wedding?,"I (30F) am getting married next year and am not inviting my Dad to my wedding. 

My parents divorced when I was in college but my Dad moved out when I was in high school, so after junior high, I didn't see him often. He's inflicted a lot of financial trauma on me (As a 22-year-old, he drove me to an ATM and told me I had to give him all of my savings so his car wouldn't get repossessed, he forged my signature on loan documents, the list goes on and on), he cheated on my mom and forced her to live without electricity while he embezzled money from his job to live in Dubai. 

For years, I tried to repair our relationship but when he got remarried in 2018 and I went to the wedding, he sprang a last-minute dinner on Friday night (even after I asked him if we should keep that night free). He and his wife got upset that I went to a baseball game with my now fiancé that night that we already had tickets for when he told us there wasn't anything to keep the night open for. I was 24 so admittedly, I should have probably gone to the dinner, but I wanted to do something nice for my now fiancé who came with me to the wedding. Fast forward six years, my Dad and his wife have never forgiven me for that night and continue to hold it over my head even though I have apologized both in person and via letter. In the years since my parent's divorce, my Dad has skipped out on divorce court dates and refuses to speak to my mother or her family. My mom is my best friend and her brother is contributing to our wedding as he knows my Dad isn't a positive figure in my life.

In December when I  got engaged, my Dad saw on social media. He's never made an effort to get to know my fiancé or visit us so I didn't bother telling him first. He texted me and said, ""saw you got engaged on FB, wow..."" and that was all. His stepdaughter, who I only met once at his wedding, then proceeded to send me scathing messages on Facebook to make sure I knew how much my Dad loves her and how he would be walking her down the aisle at her wedding one day and that everything I've done to my Dad in my life (who knows what he told her that is - haha) would come back to get me.

Recently, my Dad has tried to ""repair"" our relationship but refuses to ask his stepdaughter to apologize for what she said to me and his wife still has no interest in forgiving me for #baseballgate 2018. In my eyes, I don't want him there, or his wife and stepdaughter, as he has alienated my fiancé and my maternal family for years.

20,1d6nxs4,AITA for screaming at my brother's father after he decided to move away?,"First and foremost I'm not a Nativ English speaker so I hope that my grammar is not all that bad. This is gonna be a bit of a lengthy post but I hope you can read through it. To understand the situation I need to tell you a bit about the past. For what I can mostly remember me and my mother were alone with my grandparents as we all lived in one house. My father was never in the picture, never to be seen, never to be hear and never to talk too. He also didn't pay child support and my mother needed to skip from job to job and also needed to get a foot surgery because of a car accident which made everything harder.

When I was about 6 or 7 my mother met my brother's father who I will call Jacob for the time. He and my mother got along very well and I liked him too for some time but as soon as they told me that my mother was pregnant everything went practically downhill for me. My mother and Jacob were very careful all the time and I understood that they needed to take care of the baby more so I didn't question it further but as soon as my brother was born my mother became different. She wasn't the nice mother I had but was more or less clearly favouring my brother over me. Most of the times it was small but sometimes bigger things. She always said that she wished she had a boy first and would also just stare at her phone while I tried to show her something. All of this lead to me being rather shut in and being mostly in my room because my mother wanted to watch ""her TV shows"". One thing that didn't stop all of this tho was me getting closer whit my brother, I wasn't the greatest biggest sister in the world but I tried my best and we became close even tho he was 8 years younger then me. 

In early 2022 my mother passed away from a lung disease. Nobody knew about it and the whole thing only lasted 3 days. Even tho I wasn't close to my mother the last few years I still cried a lot. After five months we had summer break and just a few days before Jacob tells us that he had found a new woman just two months after my mother's passing and that they were in a serious relationship for the past three months, and that after we went on our vacation that he would take my brother whit him too his new woman, three hours away from all of my brothers friends and close family. That same night I put in my headphones and walked somewhere near a river while it was raining. I must have sat there for about an hour before I decided to go back home. As soon as I got back I screamed my lungs out at Jacob, that he's not thinking about anybody's feelings aside from his and not thinking about how my brother would feel in such a new setting.

21,1d6ntnt,AITA for waiting outside in the car at a party?,"Last night, my (30f) partner (30m) and his friend went to a get together to celebrate his boss winning a nationwide championship in his sport. We thought there would only be a handful of people but there would have been about 30 in their living room and kitchen. 

Most of the people there were people we know but not well, and they had all been drinking for a while before we got there. My partners work has a pretty heavy drinking culture. 

The three of us went in and mingled a little, then went outside for a vape, then went back in again. After an hour or so I felt overwhelmed by it all so I went back outside again for a bit.

 Then when I went back in things had ramped up a lot. Everyone was drunk and it was really loud. My partner was iguana wrestling with someone on the floor. It was all just too much for me so I decided to just wait in the car until my partner had had enough.

I waited for hours and when my phone ran out of battery and I couldn’t listen to my audio book, I went to find him. He was really drunk and talking about me to his bosses wife who was also really drunk. I didn’t hear what they were saying. I’m a bit choked up by this point because I really want to go home but I can’t just do what I want because I have to sober drive two people home. His bosses wife said to me “oh don’t worry, we’ll have another party and then you two can stay” which to me sounds like a nightmare. I knew if I said anything I’d lose it and start crying so I just turned around and walked out. 

My partner then took another hour and when we finally went home he was upset with me in the car for being sour and sulking. He was trying to wind me up about my driving slow and when I wouldn’t take the bait, said I was sulking and doing the silent treatment. I think I handled myself pretty well for the 40 minute trip and gave calm measured comebacks but when we got home I went to the bedroom and had a big cry. 

For context, groups of people are a pretty specific phobia of mine and have been for as long as I can remember. 3 or 4 is fine, 6 or 7 is a struggle, and any more than that is just torture. For me, alcohol makes it worse and makes me panic. We’ve been together for nearly 13 years so this isn’t news to my partner that I can’t handle this sort of thing. It is difficult to explain to other people though and I can see how it’s rude. If I’d known it was going to be that many people, I would have been clear about staying only briefly or not gone at all. 

I’ve been recently diagnosed with autism which I think validates how I feel but it’s not something any of these people would understand or even want to.

She spends ALOT!! And we are far from having a stable financial life! On top of that I recently lost my job and she just started a new one so there a good 2-3weeks that we have literally no paycheck! 

Today she just spend 400$ on clothes.. soo yeah I kinda went off and expressed verry clearly that it was the worst idea she could of had since rent was last week and we are already late. We were waiting on that paycheck to pay the rent and we'll.... now it's spent.. 

The situation elevated quite alot and ended with her saying she wants a brake because she thinks I'm toxic and hates the negative energy I'm giving off (how would you react if your gf spent the rent money on a new wardrobe) ((not positively))

She told me to leave and to give her space, not bother her and so I did exactly that

Would I be an asshole if I tell her to handle her own finances and do whatever she wants? 

If we do seperate our finances I personally would need to do a dept consolidation because everything we built together in the last 3-4years was under my name but at this point... if I don't want to worry about our money problems I think it's kinda my only option 




Edit** alot of you have been asking for me to add to this post that we have 2 kids together, I did not think it was relevant to the situation because she does prioritize the kids over herself BUT does not think about ANY bills and spends on herself after buying food, diapers and clothes for the kids ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-02,"WIBTA if I told my gf that from now on she can handle her own things?

She spends ALOT!! And we are far from having a stable financial life! On top of that I recently lost my job and she just started a new one so there a good 2-3weeks that we have literally no paycheck! 

Today she just spend 400$ on clothes.. soo yeah I kinda went off and expressed verry clearly that it was the worst idea she could of had since rent was last week and we are already late. We were waiting on that paycheck to pay the rent and we'll.... now it's spent.. 

The situation elevated quite alot and ended with her saying she wants a brake because she thinks I'm toxic and hates the negative energy I'm giving off (how would you react if your gf spent the rent money on a new wardrobe) ((not positively))

She told me to leave and to give her space, not bother her and so I did exactly that

Would I be an asshole if I tell her to handle her own finances and do whatever she wants? 

If we do seperate our finances I personally would need to do a dept consolidation because everything we built together in the last 3-4years was under my name but at this point... if I don't want to worry about our money problems I think it's kinda my only option 




Edit** alot of you have been asking for me to add to this post that we have 2 kids together, I did not think it was relevant to the situation because she does prioritize the kids over herself BUT does not think about ANY bills and spends on herself after buying food, diapers and clothes for the kids ",0.0,1.0347508192062378,1,0
23,1d6nchx,WIBTA if I asked my sublessor to pay for their cat's sitter while I'm away?,"I'm renting a sublet from someone, and part of the agreement is that I'm responsible for taking care of their cat. The sublet agreement is a MOU, not a lease, and is not legally binding. I’m not charging any pet care fee and am also paying full rent. I thought this was fine until a friend who does house sitting and pet sitting for a living told me I should have asked for reduced or even free rent. Free rent seems extreme for just taking care of a cat, but it made me reconsider my situation.

Fast forward one month into my stay, and I decide to travel for about a week, meaning I need to get a cat sitter. I couldn’t remember if the MOU covered this. Turns out, it does: the MOU stipulates that I would be financially responsible for the cat’s care while I’m away and have to use the owner’s specific cat sitter, who charges $22/day.

The sublessor is getting free cat care from me while I’m here, and if it weren’t for me, he’d have to pay someone to take care of the cat anyway. Since it’s in the MOU, I'm still planning to pay the sitter, but in the future I'm wondering if I should renegotiate the MOU.

I have told him time and time again about how it makes me feel, how sad I become, and how it deeply bothers me to hear often. I get flashbacks of unresolved trauma that cannot be fixed. 100s of hours of therapy has not fixed.

I can enjoy a number of genres but the particular “mind numbingly uninspiring sound” being played in the LIVING ROOM is driving me mad. The amount of times I have mentioned it now are often. 

Sometimes I take over the music and change it to electro types, like hardcore metal or happy animal themes or the cure. Sometime with musicians you know? The 2hr loop YouTube videos labeled “nihilistic breakcore/lofi” is so ehhh. I get it, I have been alone in my room curled up and play it, but amongst friends is just kinda weird and boring.

I asked him why he plays the music, how internally hard it is for me to hear a lot, and he said it helps him write.

27,1d6mqv9,WIBTA if I didn't go to my niece's wedding?,"Throwaway account because reasons.

It's not like me (32F) and my niece (30F) have a bad relationship, we just have no relationship or bond at all. Our parents are the best of friends and we used to go on holiday together when we were younger. While we were on holiday, me and my niece used to hang out a lot. As I had trouble making friends in primary school and after, I was kind of hoping that that hanging out would also happen at school so I would at least have someone to hang out with, but it didn't. So I didn't push and the reality was that she usually ignored me when her friends were around.

Years passed since and we've completely grown apart. Honestly I would have liked to have some sort of bond with her but she never showed any interest in having any kind of friendship with me besides the obligated family gatherings. I'll admit, past me was quite hurt by this because I never really fit in and she seemed only to want to hang out with me when there were no other options available and it sometimes even felt like she didn't want to be seen with me. Eventually I made my own friends and built up my own life and ever since our parents stopped going on holiday together, we've only made small talk once every five years or so.

Now she got engaged last year and me and my parents got invited to the wedding. My parents have no doubt about going because it's family and it's supposed to be a fun happy day. Honestly I have no interest in attending because of the following reasons: 1. She never showed any interested in having any type of bond with me, so this invitation feels like it's done purely out of politeness or to please our parents. 2. If the roles were reversed and I would invite her to my wedding, I highly doubt she would be interested in coming. I told this to my parents and they seemed disappointed and told me without many words that I should just suck it up for one day to keep up appearances. I feel like I'm getting too old to spend energy on trying to keep up appearances. WIBTA if I just declined the invitation? Because I'd rather spend my day doing something I actually enjoy doing instead of plastering a smile on my face and pretending to be happy for someone who doesn't seem to care about me.

28,1d6mpx2,AITA for refusing to be a caretaker?,"I’m freshly 18, so I don’t need to worry about it for a while, but this has been a topic that’s been weighing on me for a while as I get ready to go to college and, y’know, pursue a career.

But basically, I am the second oldest of 4 kids. My youngest sibling, my sister, has Down Syndrome among a lot of other things, and it’s been a lot for my mom to deal with, especially since my parents are divorced and my dad lives in another state, unable to help take care of her. Since I was 10, my mom has made me babysit very frequently, since my older brother doesn’t like the attitude my sister has with him. The responsibility has fallen on me for 8 years, and it’s gotten in the way of me hanging out with friends, studying, and getting rest for school the next day. I’ve gotten sick of being the sole babysitter for all these years. I don’t have the ability to say “no” to my mom about it, either, partially since she would leave me to babysit anyway, but also because I would feel bad because she’s my sister’s 24/7 caregiver. She does deserve breaks and time to herself, and I’m happy that she gets to have that, but it just sucks that it always falls on me to be the one essentially being the second parent.
This leads into the whole reason I’m making this post— I know it’s pretty damn selfish to not want to take care of my sibling when she’s in need, but I’ve never wanted kids or to be a caretaker ever in my life.  Being a part-time caregiver to my little sister has only solidified that fact for me. I’ve also battled with my mental health since I was young, and I can barely take care of myself most days, so how would I be able to handle taking care of another person? I don’t have the patience to deal with her behaviors all the time like my mom does either, since I’m really quick to get angry and lash out. 

My older brother has basically made it clear that, when my mom is unable to care for my sister, he doesn’t want to be the one to take care of her. That means that the responsibility would fall on me, since my younger brother is certainly not going to be the one to be a caregiver due to his own mental health issues. 

I’ve recently told my mom, though, that I don’t want to be her caretaker in the future, and she’s basically told me that I need to get over myself. I don’t want to do it though.

I know it’s a long while to go until things have to be decided, but am I an asshole? I struggle enough to take care of myself. I know I’m bound to get better at it, but I don’t know if I’d be able to handle the stress of taking care of my little sister all the time, or if I’d be financially stable enough to do so. My mom is unable to get a job outside of IHSS because of my sister’s need for 24/7 care and supervision, and if I have to drop a job to take care of her, I don’t know if I’d be able to financially do it. It scares and stresses me out. 

I don’t know where I’m really going with this, I just want some outside opinions and maybe a wakeup call if I AM in the wrong here.


Edit: I want to thank everyone who’s replied so far, it’s really made me feel so much better, you have no idea. For anyone concerned (and those who suggested it), I AM moving out really soon. The plan is to get an apartment with my friend in the next few months and to split rent. I don’t have a job yet, but I’ve been applying to anywhere and everywhere that’s hiring, so I’m hoping to hear back from someone soon!!! 
I also want to say that I didn’t realize the parentification that’s been going on. It’s been a real eye opener to hear that it’s something I’ve been put through. So again, thank you, especially to those who pointed it out.

I might be overthinking it, however it always makes me feel like me spending so much time at the gym is invalidated and it makes me feel like I don’t work hard for what I have, which I do.

32,1d6mbe8,WIBTA If I asked to change part of my job? ,"I 19f have been operating the sound board and various livestream equipment for my church for the past two years and four months, for 20$ an hour, and three hours a Sunday. We have two services, one traditional and one contemporary, and I operate the sound and livestream for both services. Our church is very small and we have very few members under 50. There are only two people that know how to do my job, myself and a woman I’ll call Kerrie (30something f). Kerrie is a very nice but slightly ditzy woman, and is trained to do the job entirely because someone needs to be able to do it incase I’m sick or need to be out of town. Kerrie is conveniently always “out of town” when I ask her to cover me when I’m ill, so I’ve had to come in as sick as a dog on more than one occasion, including today. I’ve had two Sundays off in the past two years, once because I had Covid and was a serious hazard to our elderly members, and the other because I asked her to cover me a month in advance with our pastor present (I went to visit my grandma out of state). Both times I’ve had to walk her through several things on the phone because of aforementioned ditzy-ness, meaning I’m not really getting time off, I’m just not in the building. I have a full time job outside of working at my church (ironically enough at a different church in the next town over as a secretary), so I’m working six days a week as well as being a full time college student, and I’m just very burnt out. 
Where I’m worried about being an asshole is wanting to ask for a change of schedule. I’m willing to give up my pay so we can work out a system that would take some of the load off my shoulders by having a rotation of people that operate the sound and livestream. This may be a problem because my church has very few young people, and the older folks simply refuse to try to understand the system (it’s slightly complicated, but not impossible to do), and I don’t want to put any stress on our Pastor by suggesting this.

My sister and I are very close, I’m 30, she’s mid 30s. She’s diagnosed with depression/anxiety/bipolar, and has had a rough year after her dog passed last year. She lives in a different state and often gets lonely living so far away, but we text/call/FaceTime literally every day. 

On the anniversary of her dog’s death, I texted her all day to check in and make sure she was alright. We didn’t make that the subject all day and started talking about what we were doing. I told her I was working, but also had saw a Reddit post about a dog needing a home in my community. She said she didn’t want to talk about dogs, and I told her I totally get it and respect that, and didn’t bring it up again. She does know my husband and I have been planning on getting another dog by July, so this wasn’t new info. 

The next day, she asked me for a picture I had made of her dog and I told her I would send it as soon as we were home. We were at the shelter to adopt our new pup, but I didn’t say that to her. I sent her the picture when I got home and she thanked me. I then posted an Instagram story about us adopting our new pup, and she sends me a text like five minutes later blowing up on me for shoving our new dog in her face ? I told her I was confused, because I hadn’t mentioned it to her since she asked me not to, and she said she was talking about my story I posted. She continued texting me just really mean things, that I have no empathy, I never care about anyone else, I never posted about her dog (?: I’m not like super active on social media), and to never talk to her again. I responded that I wasn’t sure what to say, but I do love her and am here for her. She just said to not text her again.

35,1d6m09y,"AITA for restricting my daughter's friendship with her ""Bestie?""","I (F50) have a daughter, Anna  (F13) who has a friend, Kara (F14) of 3 years. Kara has some serious mental issues. She is autistic, has anxiety and other problems. I believe A has been a good friend to her. I have also wanted to do what I could to make Kara's life a bit easier, and I have allowed some behaviors that are unusual.

For example, if Kara is going to spend the night, she might show at my home at 2 PM or 11 PM. I will never know when she might arrive. If we are picking up Kara to go somewhere, she will know at least 2-4 hours before so that she has time to ""get ready."" I usually have to wait in front of her house for 20+ minutes for her. Though I make an effort to have her safe foods in my home, often her parents bring her takeout to my home at all hours of the day or night.

Her mother, Sally (F36), seems to be part of the problem. I feel that Sally does not set any kind of boundaries for Kara, and she does not respect boundaries that I set.

Lately, Kara has begun to act badly. She mistreats Anna anytime Anna doesn't want to do what Kara wants. She ragequit a concert for something childish. She has started bragging about how men see her on social media, and the things she does to get their attention. She breaks Anna's belongings and leaves her room a mess when she's over. Most importantly, she and Sally both flout any boundaries I set.

After some problems, I declined invitations from Kara. I texted Sally that it was no accident that the girls hadn't seen each other. That I thought it was time for a break due to the way Kara has been acting. She called me cruel and accused me of isolating and ignoring Kara. She defended all Kara's behavior, even ignoring a dangerous harmful thing Kara has started doing.

I accepted that I might have been a little harsh in completely shutting them down cold-turkey. So I asked about them having a ""date"" with parents present. I am not comfortable with Kara being in my home anymore, and I am not comfortable with Anna being in the care of Sally, who knowingly left Anna at the concert without telling me so that I could move to a place where I could see her.

They agreed to a place and time to meet. Then two hours before the meeting, Sally informed me that ""Kara didn't sleep well last night, we can make it at 6 unless there's a better time for me."" Yeah. The better time for me was the original time. So I, in the vein of keeping peace, agreed to 6.

Now that I’m an adult, my kids and I always go on vacation with my dad, since I grew up poor we never went on vacation when I was a kid. So it’s been nice getting to go on vacation with him and my kids now that I’m an adult.

Even though he was raised when it wasn't as common to know from day one, he always knew, and he always saw his parents who brought him up as his ""real parents"" and he said he never had an interest in knowing his birth family. My dad's in his 60s now and never had an interest in finding out more about birth relatives.

My sister brought it up a lot of times over the years and our parents did speak to her about it being dad's decision whether *he* meets them or not. But she was told it would be her choice to do so once she was of legal age. For a few years after turning 18 she wanted it to be done by dad but then during Covid she decided she was too desperate to know and she went searching for relatives and found out dad's birth mother as well as five birth half siblings from his birth mom existed and were alive. Dad was still not interested. My sister went to meet with them. Then she wanted to include them in the family. But dad said no. And if she wanted to spend time with them as a family, it was her right, he would not be involved and he would not let her bully or pressure him into that.

38,1d6kya3,AITA For freaking out on my husband?,"My husband is great most of the time. We’re parents to a 6 month old and 4 year old. It can be overwhelming for both of us. I work from home with the baby, and don’t ever get breaks between my full time job, and taking care of the baby at the same time. On the weekends I try and deep clean the house to reset for the week. I want my family to live in a clean house. This is my space for work and living. Sure my husband does things that I don’t do and vice versa. For example he does the yard work. But I’ve been weed whacking trying to clean up the yard since he rarely does that. He just mows. 

I got triggered today because it’s 11AM and I’m in the midst of going through my deep cleaning list and getting the baby fed and down for his second nap. My husband asks if I’ve eaten anything which I state no, but I need to get the baby taken care of. The baby is breastfed and won’t take a bottle, we’ve tried many, many times. But that’s a whole other story. He leaves it at that and goes on to make himself and our toddler some lunch while I feed the baby and get him down for nap time. When I’m done, everyone’s eaten besides me so I proceed to make myself a quick lunch and tackle my deep cleaning list. All is fine and dandy as he’s keeping our toddler busy while I try to hurry through the list. The baby wakes up 30 minutes later and I mention how it’s hard to bust out my list when the baby and toddler constantly need to be tended to. He said “For sure” and gets the baby up. I’m deep cleaning my toddlers room sorting through toys and the toddler trickles in making an even bigger mess. Finding toys that haven’t been played with in months that I was planning on tossing out. I lose my cool. The baby starts crying again so I go to feed him and try and get him down for another nap. It just doesn’t happen. I started going off on my husband on why do I need to deep clean by myself every weekend? It’s taken me 4 hours to try and tackle my list when I could get it done in 2 hours without any interruptions. He said he has been cleaning all morning too. He does the occasional dishes and takes out the garbage but most of the time it’s me asking him to. I mention how it would be so much quicker if he would help me tackle the deep cleaning list so that I could actually take the rest of the day to relax. We argue back and forth and he says “Just tell me what to do”. I proceed to tell him, but it’s like can you not look at my list or recognize I need help or a break? We haven’t been talking since the fight. I know we are both overwhelmed with kids these days but AITA? 

Edit to add: I guess it’s not a deep cleaning every weekend. The list I’ve mentioned has been pointed out that this is more of a maintenance clean which I agree with. This is vacuuming, wiping counters, scrubbing toilets, laundry, dishes, etc. I like the advice with communicating more on expectations and breaking up the list. It shouldn’t be my list, but ours.

42,1d6ka20,AITA for snapping against my friend?,"Since 7th grade I had this friend group, me, Tom, Gabe and Max. When the 8th grade started, a new girl, Marcos, came to our class. My friend group befriended her and she became part of our group. The first major situation that happened with Marcos was when me and Tom were talking about the finalists gala on our school. Out of curiosity I asked him who his pair for the gala was. Tom said he was going with Marcos, saying she had told him I already had a pair (I didn't). I talked to Marcos to clear this and she told me without hesitating that Isa told her she was going to invite me to be her pair. I thought it was weird because I wasn't close to Isa. Since I was suspicious, I texted Isa asking her if she was going to invite me, which she replied no

During lunchtime, I was hanging out with two of my friends Sam and Roxy, and since I was unsure of what to do, I told them the story, without saying it happened to me. They gave me their opinion but I gain courage to tell them the story was about me. They were shocked and asked if I was being serious. At this point, I was panicking due to how stressful this was being. One of them asked me if I knew about the video and I had no idea what they were talking about.  
Someone had sent one of the girls in my class a sexual video of Marcos showing her lower parts (apparently everyone in my class knew about this except me, Tom, Gabe, Max and Marcos). I was shocked and Sam and Roxy told me other lies Marcos had told them (having diabetes, judging girls for their body when she has a similar body type to them, etc)

To talk about the situation that made me create this post, I got a message that Marcos had added Max into the group that me, Tom, Gabe, and her had. I texted the girls in a separate group about what she had done and they were shocked like me. In the group chat where she added Max, I texted ""Why did you add Max?"". Then Marcos sent a message saying ""Because I wanted to"" (she would often say this in a cocky tone). My anger grew as I snapped. I sent a long message saying she didn't need to speak to me like she was better or superior. I said she shouldn't have added Max without letting us know and told her that she could complain all she wanted, cause I was right there listening to her.  
While the girls in the other group supported me, Gabe and Max came to her defense saying that that was unnecessary.

Both Gabe and Marcos herself argued that I had also added people they didn't know to the group before, and I hadn't asked either (To my defense I added 2 of my friends without asking the group but I told them who they were and asked if they didn't mind. I couldn't confirm this since I had erased old messages from the group). The girls on the other group reassured me I did the right thing and they told me if Max, Gabe, and Marcos tried to confront me face to face, they would be by my side

44,1d6k239,AITA for trying to get away from my friend? ,"Me (18F) and Charles (fake name, 19M) have been friends for some months since we started college. Even though we really bonded, I have noticed that he may not be a great friend. 

To start, when we are alone he starts talking badly about some friends we have in common. Since he found out that my faimily has more money than his, he started to make sure to make me uncomfortable about this: he always asks me to pay something for him (even when it's expensive or  unnecessary) and encourages our friends to do the same. He also does comments about the way I dress, about my hair (saying I should use better clothes and have a hair treatment since I have money enough to) and about my lifestyle and how my life is futile and frivolous because I'm white and rich (he's black and poor). Futhermore, he insists to joke about my house is far away from everything. 

I tried to ignore all that because we work really well together in projects and didn't want to affect my grades because of it. However, now what he did was the last straw. We were doing a sociology project in a trio, me, him and other friend, usually I edit the projects we do but this time he asked to do it. Unfortunately, I completely forgot and edited the project. After he noticed, he started to being rude at me saying that I that this was something he couldn't forgive after all I did and he wouldn't leave the group because of our friend. Just to make clear, I didn't do nothing to him and I apoligize for my mistake. 

He knows my life is kinda crazy after my gradma was diagnosed with dementia and know I'm trying to spend more time with her (specially on the weekends). This is not an excuse, but I apoligize and, sincerelly, my mistake doesn't really harm anyone to justify this kind of behaviour. As I tried to be bigger person, he asked to talk to me personally in Monday to have a real talk. 

However, we are not kids anymore and I'm tired of him acting like a angry teenager all the time. So in the talk I problably gonna say that I understand his reasons, but I think we are spending to much time together and our friendship is wearing thin because of this. I also intend to unvite him to my birthday and to spend part of the summer in my beach house.  (for a little bit of context: I always have huge birthday parties and schedule the date to the trip to my beach house).

45,1d6js0n,AITA for keeping an expensive gaming device when unsure if I'm dating the man who gave it to me?,"For context, I (30F) have known Max (35M) for 10+ years.

I am not sure of where we stand, and ""complicated"" would pretty much summarize where we stand. I can't get him to label our relationship, even if he takes on boyfriend duties and I help him on his business as a consultant. Before anyone ask, yes, I have asked him and he flats out refuses to answer, and I'm on the autistic spectrum so reading social cues or ""signals"" is hard.

Thing is, back in December, my laptop broke, I was unable to fix it on my own, and that computer is...well, the entire source of my income. He owns a computer shop, so he offered to take a look at it, and knowing the importance of the device, he borrowed me a pretty powerful and expensive gaming laptop, stating that it was just ""while he looked at mine"".

Months went by, and whenever I asked about my computer he ignored the question, and refused to give me the price of the new device so I could pay for it.

My best friend, Laura (31F) is well aware of this. She has seen Max in the photos I keep from him and has heard him talk, she has insisted he is just ""playing me"" and saying I should pressure him for a label so I stop ""wasting my time"", but it was never as aggresive as three weeks ago, when I was leaving for Europe to attend family matters. I told him I was requesting leave from my work with him because I wasn't taking the expensive laptop and risk losing or damaging it when I hadn't paid for it. His answer was ""don't mind the computer, that's a gift from me"" I tried to protest, I mean, that's a pretty expensive thing, plus, I dislike receiving gifts (more a giver than a taker) but he was adamant that ""it was a gift and he didn't care if I didn't agree, I was not giving it back""

This seemed to bother Laura greatly. During the entire travel, she didn't even checked in with me once, when I came back, I brought her some of her favorite chocolates and called her for coffee at my place. She flat out refused, and I didn't understand why, until last night, when it apparently was too much for her. She started crying (???) Telling me it was unfair to see just how easy I had it, how all I needed to do was ""f*ck with someone"" and suddenly I had all the best. I was confused, she knows very well Max and I have not been intimate yet, and I reminded her that. She then proceeded to tell me it was even worse, that I should pay the laptop, that it was inmoral to keep such an expensive gift when he isn't my boyfriend or anything.

I'm confused, not sure if that's a bad thing?, I briefly wonder what's up with Laura or how do the laptop thing affects her, but then again, I rarely understand this type of unusual situations so I might be an ass without realizing it, perhaps I'm not being empathetic to her?, perhaps it is bad or actually inmoral to keep the laptop not knowing where I stand with the guy?

47,1d6jjky,AITA for telling my MIL that she has too many dogs?,"For context, 4 years ago my husband (then bf) and I got a yorkie dog when we met my in-laws adorable yorkie puppy. In-laws went on to get a second and third yorkie over the course of 2 years. One day MIL calls to say that female dog is pregnant with 5 puppies and we had to work to convince her that getting rid of the puppies would be a good idea as opposed to keeping them. She agreed back then. Once the puppies reached maturity she barely tried to advertise them and said that anyone who contacted her “wasn’t a good home”. We did get one puppy from her bringing the dog count to us-2 dogs, MIL- 7 dogs. The puppies are now 9 months old and she still has all of them (besides 1).

We’ve tried to deter her from keeping them with scary thoughts of littermate syndrome, inbreeding, and impossible potty training. She’s “combated” that by getting all 7 dogs neutered/spayed.

Last week we went to visit and had 9 dogs running around the house… and it was complete chaos. She hasn’t been able to potty train the 4 puppies or really do any training due to working outside of the house. We were able to fully potty train our puppy in 1.5 months. Their daily routine is to come home and grab the mop. You have to be silent at night because one creak of the door will send all her dogs into a barking frenzy. We sat down to have a conversation about the future and she admitted that she never wanted to get rid of the puppies, she doesn’t care about having to clean up the messes, and she enjoys the company of all 7 dogs. We told her that we don’t enjoy visiting because she has too many dogs that are not well behaved. She is always very upset when we bring up the dogs which makes me believe that she knows it’s odd but she digs her feet further into the ground every time.

 I understand that some people are okay with having a large amount of dogs but she was never this kind of person before, always a 1-2 dog family. AITA for telling my mother in law that she has too many dogs and we don’t enjoy visiting?
",Not the A-hole,2024-06-02,"AITA for telling my MIL that she has too many dogs? For context, 4 years ago my husband (then bf) and I got a yorkie dog when we met my in-laws adorable yorkie puppy. In-laws went on to get a second and third yorkie over the course of 2 years. One day MIL calls to say that female dog is pregnant with 5 puppies and we had to work to convince her that getting rid of the puppies would be a good idea as opposed to keeping them. She agreed back then. Once the puppies reached maturity she barely tried to advertise them and said that anyone who contacted her “wasn’t a good home”. We did get one puppy from her bringing the dog count to us-2 dogs, MIL- 7 dogs. The puppies are now 9 months old and she still has all of them (besides 1).

We’ve tried to deter her from keeping them with scary thoughts of littermate syndrome, inbreeding, and impossible potty training. She’s “combated” that by getting all 7 dogs neutered/spayed.

48,1d6jiwu,AITA for calling out my coworker’s “borrowing” habit?,"I (28M) work in a small office with a close-knit team. We all get along well, except for a borrowing habit of my coworker, Lola (30F).

Here’s the issue: Lola constantly “borrows” my stuff. Stapler, highlighters, even my lunch once (though she sheepishly replaced it). I get it, small things happen. But it’s become excessive. My stapler goes missing, I find it on her desk. I bring a new pack of pens, half are gone by the week’s end.

The other day, I brought in a specific coffee mug — a limited edition one from my favorite band. It wasn’t dishwasher safe, so I hand-washed it and left it on my desk to dry. I come back from a meeting, and it’s gone. I see Lola using it at her desk.

I calmly asked for it back, explaining it’s very special to me. She apologized and said she’d be careful, but I was firm. I told her I needed it back because it wasn’t something I wanted to risk getting damaged.

She got huffy, claiming I was being dramatic and that it was “just a mug.” I told her it wasn’t “just a mug” to me, and that repeatedly taking things without asking was inconsiderate. She stormed off, and now everyone’s giving me the silent treatment, implying I’m overreacting.

58,1d6ih5n,AITA for refusing to help my sister with her kids after she said I was wasting money by putting my foster daughter in private school?,"I have been fostering Maya (8) for about 7 months now. 

I work at a children's hospital and Maya came in around 10 months ago with some pretty horrific injuries. She was in the hospital for 2.5 months and had 3 surgeries and a lot of PT and OT. She didn't have any family so I took care of her while she was there. I got her some clothes and toys, learned how to do her hair, watched frozen 50 times, stayed the night before/after surgeries or when she had a rough day, I cooked for her, introduced her to fruits and vegetables. I ended up falling in love with this little girl and had to keep her. I was able to get licensed pretty quickly because of my job so when she came home from the hospital, she went straight to me. 

The public school sent a teacher to the hospital then the house for a while, then when she was able to go to school she was put in the special ed class in a public school with a plan to eventually get her in mainstream classes. 

There weren't exactly any problems with the public school or her class, it just wasn't a good fit. She wasn't making friends, wasn't making any improvements with their speech therapist, wasn't learning much even though her teachers tried and her school got her 5 hours/week of tutoring, and she'd hold my hand and take a nap the second we got home (she's not much of a napper). 

I decided to look at private schools and found a Montessori inspired school around 45 minutes from my house. We took a tour, she did the assessment, and she got in. She started in March and she's doing great. She's speaking more and more clearly, she's learning so much, and she even has 2 friends.

I was talking to my sister about Maya and this school and how she and her husband might want to consider it for their older daughter (2, the preschool starts at 3) and she asked why I'm sending a kid I might not get to keep to private school and that it would be a waste of money if she goes to a family member. 

I told her not to worry about me ""wasting"" my money on Maya and that I'm happy to pay if it's helping her. She kept pushing and I told her that if this is how she feels about my kid I will have to distance myself from her and will not be helping with her kids anymore. Now she's calling me sensitive  and claims that I'm abandoning my family. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-02,"AITA for refusing to help my sister with her kids after she said I was wasting money by putting my foster daughter in private school? I have been fostering Maya (8) for about 7 months now. 

I work at a children's hospital and Maya came in around 10 months ago with some pretty horrific injuries. She was in the hospital for 2.5 months and had 3 surgeries and a lot of PT and OT. She didn't have any family so I took care of her while she was there. I got her some clothes and toys, learned how to do her hair, watched frozen 50 times, stayed the night before/after surgeries or when she had a rough day, I cooked for her, introduced her to fruits and vegetables. I ended up falling in love with this little girl and had to keep her. I was able to get licensed pretty quickly because of my job so when she came home from the hospital, she went straight to me. 

The public school sent a teacher to the hospital then the house for a while, then when she was able to go to school she was put in the special ed class in a public school with a plan to eventually get her in mainstream classes. 

There weren't exactly any problems with the public school or her class, it just wasn't a good fit. She wasn't making friends, wasn't making any improvements with their speech therapist, wasn't learning much even though her teachers tried and her school got her 5 hours/week of tutoring, and she'd hold my hand and take a nap the second we got home (she's not much of a napper). 

I decided to look at private schools and found a Montessori inspired school around 45 minutes from my house. We took a tour, she did the assessment, and she got in. She started in March and she's doing great. She's speaking more and more clearly, she's learning so much, and she even has 2 friends.

60,1d6id9j,AITA For not congratulating my sister after taking the ASVAB?,"Recently my sister has been really trying to get into the military, and after some talking I told her to study as much as she could for the ASVAB as it can determine how helpful it is when she gets out of the military (In terms of what job she gets). She dropped out of high school, and she thinks that this is her only opportunity to do something “Big”. I supported her for the first couple of months but after I saw she wasn’t studying like she said she was, I lost interest in trying to help her. 

She went to the recruiting office and took her first test shortly after I stopped helping her and she ended up getting a 16. Now I’m not a genius myself but I was pretty disappointed. So I decided to try and help her again to hopefully make her realize that it’s not as hard as she is making it seem, but instead she continues to go on a rant about how she will do it later. My mom and dad have always catered to her giving her no responsibility growing up (including letting her drop out) simply because she is the only girl in the family other than my mom. I tried many times to convince my mom to talk to her but without a doubt, I know she didn’t.

Anyway. Some more time passed and she ended up going and taking it again with my younger brother present and scored a 19, but told my family she got a high 90. Even though my brother told everyone what she really got. They insisted that he was just trying to make her look bad. My mom made it a big thing, throwing her a small party, posting on Facebook about it, and even bragging to me about how she got 10 points higher than me and my brother. (we both are in the military so we know how kind of jobs a 20 can get you…. Barely any good jobs)

To top it all off, my sister convinced my mom that I should congratulate her for getting a high score, and my mom and dad have been calling and yelling at me that I should support my sister. I refuse to add onto the lies.

63,1d6hsn8,AITA for asking my partner for some time alone?,"My gf and I met in a shared college class. When exams came around, we'd been together just under 2 months, spending all our time out of classes together at that point. I usually really need time alone, so it was a difficult change at first, but it was important.

After exams, I went to spend about 5 days visiting family and taking care of some business I had in my hometown. She wasn't super enthused but wasn't really upset either. When I got back from it, though, I learned that she was under the impression we'd be spending every day and night together when possible. I tried, but after 3 days or so, I needed time alone. She was supportive when I asked, but I only ended up spending the night (11p to about 10a) on my own. Most of which I was asleep for.

4-5 days later, I asked again for time alone.  We'd be on a trip would be 9 days with some friends, so I wanted to a short break before. It happened that the day before we left marked 3 months of the relationship, so I wanted to take the day before to myself, then spend the day of our 3mo together. I'd planned to get her favorite flowers and cook dinner for us before basically 9 days of no time alone together.

When I asked for a day to myself, she was uneasy but said it was alright, so I spent the day packing and preparing for the next day. All the while we had been texting, and at around 8p she asked if she could come by at around 9a the next morning. She said her summer online class ended after the cleaners for her apartment arrived, and she didn't want to be there for it l, so she'd be by before the class started. Before, I was coming by at 10a so I'd have time to actually get the flowers and surprise her at her place with them. I said yes, she could. When she came by she hadn't started packing at all. We spent the night at her place before heading out.

The trip was pretty hard on me. There had been about 11 days of constant contact, plus my depression was getting to me, and my partner's behavior on the trip was frustrating. It was small things, so I let them go. No point ruining a trip over something small.

I let her know that I'd need time after this, as it would have been a week and a half since I'd spent more than maybe a half hour alone. I wanted two days to decompress after that trip, but she didn't want me to take that time. It would be 2 days, but she only wanted me to take one at most.

We get back from the trip and we have the discussion again. She told me she didn't understand why I needed to take time alone at all. I tried to explain again, but she asks me what I'm gonna do when we live together. I told her that I'm doing my best to change, but it's gonna take time. She said even though we're in a very safe area, she's anxious to be alone overnight. I try to be receptive to that, so we compromised. I'd spend the night, have the next day, then go back.

67,1d6gzou,AITAH for cutting off my best friend because of her boyfriend?,"I (19m) recently invited my best friend of 10 years (18f) on a mall trip with a mutual friend and she and her boyfriend (21m) ruined the whole thing for me and said mutual friend. I'm not sure if I'm just being emotional right now or if I'm being reasonable, but this mall trip resulted in me blocking the two of them on everything. 

When my best friend got into a relationship, I understood that I was no longer going to be her main priority socially and that she was going to spend most of her time with her new bf, who she's now been dating for around 7 months. When they began dating, I didn’t really like him for a various amount of reasons, one of the reasons being that his bad habits really rubbed off on her or maybe enabled her to do the same things (this will be important later on). I only talked to her about it a little though, as she's never gotten very involved in my relationships or overly criticized them, so I felt I couldn't do the same.

Anyway, last week I invited her and a mutual friend on a mall trip together since, of course, it's been a while since the three of us hung out together. Since my best friend still lives with her parents and has very strict parents, she tells me she's going to ask her mom and see if it's okay to go. She informs me she'll tell me about her moms decision the next day on campus, and when we meet on campus the next day for coffee, she then asks me IN FRONT of her bf if he can come with us. I don't handle being put on the spot like that very well, so of course I agree and try to give her the benefit of the doubt since she's never done this to me before and I try my best to think she did it on accident. 

Anyways, now comes the actual day of the mall trip. I had work until 5 pm and told them I wouldn’t be able to pick them up any earlier as my work place is at least 20 minutes away (my best friend agreed to this and I was under the impression her mom agreed to it to). I pick them up around 5:30 and when they get in the car, my best friend claims she has a bunch of missed calls from her mom and picks up frantically. 

The phone discussion with her mom was kind of frantic because her mom is really just expressing worry for her, which I felt was reasonable so I mostly ignored. I was ignoring her phone call until I hear her mom ask her ""What were you still doing on campus at 5? I thought you guys were supposed to leave at 4:30"" 
At first I thought this was just miscommunication on my best friends part, and that she was going to explain that to her mom. However, my best friend them flips the script and tells her mom ""I thought the trip was at 4:30 but supposedly it's 5"", making it seem like it was MY fault she was on campus so late.

After she ended the call with her mom, I asked her why she lied to her mom in the first place and she said that she didn’t know why, but ""next time she'll tell the truth"". Her and her boyfriend then get in a discussion in the back of my car about how ""crazy"" their parents are and how HE lies to his mom all the time because she's ""too strict"". At this point I was really over it but we go to the mall anyways and look for the mutual friend I invited to come with us. While looking, I realize that my best friend and her bf are GONE and that they left me sometime when I was looking for the said mutual friend. I end up hanging out with that mutual friend and when I'm about ready to go, I call her and tell me to meet up at this store by the entrance. Now I have slightly bad eyesight and because of this, I don't like to drive when it gets dark. I tried to leave before sunset but because our trip was so late (my fault) of course it was already night by the time I was ready to go home. When her and her bf meet up with us, she then asks me in front of him AGAIN if he could get a ride home (this was very last minute and the only reason I'm so upset is because she invited him but he didn’t plan anything out himself) and I say yes. And to wrap up the night he fails to describe his neighborhood or where he lives, having my driving around looking for his vague description, and they make out in the back of my car.

I thought that surely my best friend would apologize for AT LEAST lying to her mom about it and making me look bad but she didn’t, and acted like the whole thing never happened. So last night I blocked the two of them on everything and I've been getting calls from random numbers and dms on random accounts ever since. My mutual friend and a few other friends have told me that what I've done was just too far and that they're just in their ""honeymoon stage"" and that I should unblock them.

I have been married to my husband for many years and have been apart of my stepdaughter life since we began dating. We had the usual every other week custody with her Mother. Step daughter has had behavioral issues for several years now and has done poorly in school since elementary school. Not completing homework or turning it in, not doing well in tests and never seeking help from teachers. She is on medication for ADHD and depression. Also diagnosis with oppositional defiance. She lies and sneaks around.  At our house we have rules and consequences that all the kids follow.  We have a total of 6 kids. 4 of mine from a previous relationship and the youngest is ours together. When the stepdaughter is at her mothers house, there seems to be no rules or consequences and mother constantly belittling her, calls her names, screams and yells at her and using her to get status.  Stepdaughter barely passed high school and we were literally told two days before school ended that she was graduating. Now she has completed her first year of college unsuccessfully. She failed classes in both semesters and has continually lied about it. My husband also footed the bill for housing and food. We had a conversation this spring with her and she cried and cried how she wants to take some time off and look for a job but was also told to check with the college if she could take summer classes or what she needed to do to retake those courses. Here we are summer and from what we know she probably hasn’t done this and refuses to contact her father. When asked what she wants to do for a job she didn’t have any idea. Figured she can just work the bare minimum jobs where turnover happens all the time. No set plans, goals or ideas for her future. Lease renewal is coming up and I keep harping on husband to cancel the lease since she refuses to tell anyone her plans. Why have a name on something that could damage your name and finances. Husband get so mad when asked about it but mad because daughter avoids any contact. At this point the bridge is burnt between myself and stepdaughter. I’m not going to listen to her pity party. Time to grow up and make adult choices and decisions which my husband does agree to this and says whatever those choices and decisions are she will have to live with them and deal with the consequences.

69,1d6geza,AITAH if I talked to my bf's mother even if my bf told me not to do so?,"My (19F) bf (19M) has been having problems with his mom. The thing is, he spends a lot of time with me and when he's at home, he tends to stay at a nearby computer shop to play games and it's becoming an issue as my bf's mom says that my bf doesn't prioritize his mom and his family at home.

For context, my bf's mom left him when he was young (6-8 years old) to work in another country and he was left here under the guidance of his grandma from his father's side since his dad is in rehabilitation center for alcohol addiction. His mother came back like 5 years ago because she was pregnant with another guy. I'm not sure when his dad and mom separated and currently, his mom is in a relationship with another different guy other from his dad and the dad of his step-sister.

I see his mother's efforts to repay him for all the years she was gone by buying him things he needs and supporting our relationship and gaming habits but that wasn't helping my bf to be close to his mom. My bf is not materialistic and is perfectly okay with people giving him efforts instead of things so it doesn't really give him closure for all those years when 1)his mom doesn't attend school-related things because she's busy all the time and the only time she attended was his graduation recently and they were even late, 2)couldn't have a goddamn birthday party for my bf's 18th birthday because they were in a middle of conflict at that time and 3)my bf gets to take care of his lil step-sister when the mom wasn't even doing anything at home (this is happening a lot when the step-sister was younger and I see this currently with my two eyes when I'm at their place. It's usually that they're both doing nothing but she doesn't currently have a job and the kid is 5 years old, I think that's enough rest for her to take care of the kid.)

Now, it's fine by me if my bf decided to really cut off from them but I don't like it that the mother calls him as someone with no respect to them when I don't even feel like he is now okay with the loss of a mother for so many years in his youth and she hasn't completely filled that void in him. (pls note that she actively tells other people that he is disrespectful, even posting it online. And he is open to his aunt on his father's side that was there with him and his grandma when his mom wasn't so that's where I got the idea that it's just his thing for his mom.)

My bf tells me to just leave it alone and let him do anything and everything but it really boils my blood. I am really thinking hard about this since my name was mentioned in the post and I know that my mom wouldn't like it and it'll be a whole bigger mess (I don't want my mom to get involved in this since she is a single mother raising me and my lil brother).

I plan to talk to my bf's mother tomorrow and try my best to explain his POV without making a mess. Am I doing the right thing and AITAH?

I am severely (but not life-threateningly) allergic to dogs and cannot go into the homes of people who own dogs. Three years ago, I flew to visit one of my best friends in her home state. She picked me up from the airport. It turned out that she had had a relative's dog that shed a lot in her car the week before (and hadn't cleaned the car since) and I had an allergy attack. My allergies cause migraines and I was struggling for most of the trip. She said we could clean out the inside of her car together but I didn't want to make my allergies any worse by interacting more closely with the dog dander and offered to pay to have the inside of her car professionally cleaned at a car-wash place.

Since then, my friend has moved to my side of the country and we have started going on an annual trip. This will be the third year. I take Amtrak to her city, after which she drives us to our destination. Since she now lives with a roommate who has a dog that regularly goes in her car, she gets her car cleaned before the trip. Last year, she asked me to find a place that does cheap car cleaning, so I found one near her house that would vacuum/wipe down the inside of her car for $35. The people at the shop caused some of the leather in her car to rip and she was annoyed.

This year, she found a different place that will clean out the car for $45. I found out recently that she feels resentful that getting her car cleaned has become a yearly expectation that she doesn't feel appreciated for and that since the first time I haven't offered to pay for it again, even after her leather got ripped by the cleaners. I apologized, thanked her for cleaning her car, and offered to pay the $45, because this is a ten-year friendship and it feels silly to allow there to be negative feelings over $45, but I've still been thinking about it and wanted to check if IATA.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-02,"AITA for not previously offering to pay to wash my friend's car?

Last year, she asked me to find a place that does cheap car cleaning, so I found one near her house that would vacuum/wipe down the inside of her car for $35. The people at the shop caused some of the leather in her car to rip and she was annoyed.

This year, she found a different place that will clean out the car for $45. I found out recently that she feels resentful that getting her car cleaned has become a yearly expectation that she doesn't feel appreciated for and that since the first time I haven't offered to pay for it again, even after her leather got ripped by the cleaners. I apologized, thanked her for cleaning her car, and offered to pay the $45, because this is a ten-year friendship and it feels silly to allow there to be negative feelings over $45, but I've still been thinking about it and wanted to check if IATA.",0.0,0.10920150578022003,0,1

An argument ensued re how I don’t do enough to help her with our son, with my main point being that she is our sons “primary” care give and; 

A) you’ve not worked for 12 months
B) you aren’t returning to work full time
C) we now pay her parents to clean our house (affordable due to my work)

I get really fucked off when my wife scoffs at me after she tries to assign me a job to do via a disingenuous question - for example this afternoon, I asked if our son was due a nap and she replied “yes, do you want to walk him around the block?”, I am pretty tired after catering at his birthday party yesterday, so I said “do you want to take him?”

An argument ensued re how I don’t do enough to help her with our son, with my main point being that she is our sons “primary” care give and; 

A) you’ve not worked for 12 months
B) you aren’t returning to work full time
C) we now pay her parents to clean our house (affordable due to my work)

For context, I like to cook, so I cook all our dinners. As I say, cleaning is taken care of by somebody else… I’ve always helped with our son, whether it’s changing nappies or feeding time etc. admittedly she does much more than me (particularly whilst she was breast feeding), but she quipped my view on us parenting is like something from the “dark ages”…

My family is solidly lower middle class, there were periods of time in the past where my parents had to be stringent with money and save up. I never complained during those times, and if I couldn't' buy something I wanted that was too expensive I'd usually let it go. It has kind of grown into me just being terrified in general to ask my parents for anything.  
  
My stipend from these two internships isn't much, but saved up over 3 months it would be enough for me to buy a Samsung tablet with a stylus, so that I could use it for my next year in college. I also admittedly just really wanted a device like that because I could never really splurge on one. I had added it to our family's shared Amazon account to buy at the end of 3 months.

84,1d6dk77,AITA for scheduling a viewing the evening before,"So my housemate is moving out. She told me about this a couple days ago and I go on holidays in three days, which means that I have very little time to find a new housemate. 

Yesterday evening I got in touch with a person who might want to move in and I scheduled a viewing of the room and house with her for 1pm the next day (today). Then I texted in the house group chat that I had scheduled a viewing and said that I hope it suits my current housemate’s schedule. She did not respond. 

Today I had to push the viewing a half hour, for other reasons, so it would be at 1:30pm. I knocked on my housemate’s door at 1:25pm to ask her if I could show the room to a potential new housemate in five. She got mad at me and said she wasn’t ready, but she’d get ready as soon as possible. I then had the call with the potential new housemate and showed her the rest of the house and chatted to get to know each other a little, but she had to go because she had an appointment.

My current housemate then left the house about half an hour later, and on her way out she roasted me for not messaging her directly about the viewing. She blamed her not reading the group chat message on her being too busy at work and demanded that I text her directly next time I have a viewing. I tried telling her then that I had to reschedule the viewing of the room to later today because the new person had an appointment to catch, but she wouldn’t stop to listen to anything I had to say and just talked over me and left the house without listening to me. 

As you can probably tell, I don’t really get along with this person in general. I don’t have the best of experiences with texting her directly, so that’s partly why I wasn’t inclined to do so. There were also other circumstances to this potential new housemate contact that made it most natural to text it in the house group chat. 

But now I’m left wondering, am I the asshole for scheduling a viewing with such short notice? Is 1pm on a Sunday too early to have a viewing? 

Edit: “roommate” to “housemate” to clarify that we do not share a room. Sorry for any confusion.

Edit 2: She doesn’t move out until the end of June so she has given plenty notice. It’s the fact that I go on holidays that means I have very little time to sort this.

Now to the main problem, the city we live in, is one that during the summer (winter too but less) is FULL of tourists from different countries and one of their main attractions is the seaside because of the sunsets and ofc the beach itself, our house is located in front of it and we could gain alot if we gave it up for rent during the summer only.

Everyone in our family was pro about this but when i told my cousin (23f) she disapproved of it.

89,1d6cdu6,WIBTA if I didn’t want to give everyone a piece of my birthday cake?,"Here’s the situation. 

I (21F) had my birthday party the other day. Big celebration 45+ in attendance, booked room,DJ ,the whole shibang.

The issue arises today where the discussion of my cake came up. Now this cake was big but not 45+ people big. I had cut the cake near the end of the night and offered up as much as I could to those’d who were there that night.

Now I know not everyone got a piece but there were cupcakes too on display for people to take and enjoy. I had managed to get a decent chunk for me to have because I didn’t get to have any before we left.

Anyway this morning I decided to go to the fridge and grab a slice.

Here’s the issue, my nanna believes that because everyone came and some got me presents that everyone who attended should get a piece of the left over cake even though not everyone was there by the time I cut the cake. Even if that means I don’t get a slice.

I can’t lie, I didn’t spend time and money deciding on a cake in my favourite flavour and style for me not to get at least a slice? 

Maybe it’s just me but I personally don’t expect to get a cake at a huge birthday party like the one I had. 

Unfortunately my nanna will be my nanna and continue to give out the cake to those in the street who went to the party. So the slice I managed to get will be the only slice I have.

I don’t know if it makes me the asshole or not to want to have some left over cake for the next few days to enjoy.  

So Reddit AITA?


- Also some info to note if it helps -

- when I placed and payed the order for the cake a month ago the guest invite was only 28 people

- I wasn’t told that an extra 15 were invited till  about a week ago and these people were invited by my nanna who had asked my mum

 (mum was helping organise invitations and everything and she’s wasn’t too happy about the number of people my nanna was inviting either)

- also there was a full buffet available to everyone in attendance the cake wasn’t the only food people had.

Here’s the issue, my nanna believes that because everyone came and some got me presents that everyone who attended should get a piece of the left over cake even though not everyone was there by the time I cut the cake. Even if that means I don’t get a slice.

I can’t lie, I didn’t spend time and money deciding on a cake in my favourite flavour and style for me not to get at least a slice? 

Maybe it’s just me but I personally don’t expect to get a cake at a huge birthday party like the one I had. 

Unfortunately my nanna will be my nanna and continue to give out the cake to those in the street who went to the party. So the slice I managed to get will be the only slice I have.

I don’t know if it makes me the asshole or not to want to have some left over cake for the next few days to enjoy.  

So Reddit AITA?


- Also some info to note if it helps -

- when I placed and payed the order for the cake a month ago the guest invite was only 28 people

- I wasn’t told that an extra 15 were invited till  about a week ago and these people were invited by my nanna who had asked my mum

 (mum was helping organise invitations and everything and she’s wasn’t too happy about the number of people my nanna was inviting either)

- also there was a full buffet available to everyone in attendance the cake wasn’t the only food people had.

90,1d6c9kl,AITA for “overreacting” to a scratched vinyl?,"For context, I've started to collect vinyls, and my first ever one I had gotten on Wednesday, costed 64$ to have it arrive on thursday.

After a good run through of all the sides, my little brother who gets angry quite easily, came downstairs, played on his tablet, and once his time was up, he had breakfast, and then got mad because I said no to him playing on the Xbox. He banged on the table, with the vinyl playing on the turntable, and scratched up my new record, then I yelled at him to go up to his room, furious. 

After he comes downstairs, my vinyl is playing side A, and he banged on the table again, I stay calm, wait for my uncle to get home, since he's good with vinyl records, and ask him to look at the damages.

The vinyl had fucking scratches on Side A & B, and now side B is looping back on track's 11 and 17, so I go upstairs, furious, and try to clean it, after cleaning, the quality of Side A & B were significantly worse, and my parents won't pay me back for something my little brother caused, and they're saying I'm overreacting, and that no one cares about it, and it's just a vinyl.

He also said if distance wasn't futile he'd like to get to know her more. 

Now don't get me wrong. I compliment my guy friends when they're trying to buff up saying wow you look good or wow looking hot. But I always show my boyfriend how they look or he hears me say it if I'm on the phone with them. 

This is the second time he's done this on his DMs though. And never once has he talked about them to me. It's like he hides them. 

I know this doesn't count as cheating and it's not like they're swapping pictures, but it's like a punch in the gut and shoots down my self esteem.

With extra context. He said that she has an eating disorder if I scrolled up and he wanted to cheer her up. My friend said it's not his job to make her feel better. But what if I am just overreacting? 

So currently I'm ignoring him and avoiding him every which way. AITA or should I just forget about this?

93,1d6c0dy,WIBTA if I bought a dog when my husband wants to wait,"My husband and I love dogs. We both want a dog badly, and we both agree dogs help our mental state.

But the thing is, he wants to wait until we get a new house with a yard. We live in a duplex with a sad excuse for a yard. Well, more of a vegetable patch. And in addition, I’ve been applying for jobs out of town/country (it’s a very specific niche and it’s not available in our area). He thinks that having a dog would complicate that. 

Sadly, with our financial status, we are not moving any time soon. We’re still paying for his mortgage, and we don’t have enough to do that and save up for a new house. 

Re: job applications. Well, I haven’t had any luck. Not one interview. And honestly, if I did get a job. I’ll own up to it and handle all the responsibility. 

Also, we were puppy sitting for 6 months when his  friend was in and out of the hospital. And it all worked out. Though, that dog barely made a sound. 

Soooo, hence the title. A part of me just wants to get a dog. One small enough for our living space, and I’ll take full responsibility of it. I’ll train it, feed it, bring it out for walks. Ugh.

So WIBTA? 

Edit:
I’d like to clarify. I do have a job, but I’ve been applying to places for my dream job. My job earns enough that I pay half of the bills and 40% of his monthly mortgage. I also earn enough to have savings, and pamper myself every now and then with travel, hair dyes, equipment etc. I can afford the dog on my own. I’d just have to lessen all of the pampering moments by a lot, and that’s something I’m willing to do.

But I get it. I won’t be getting a dog. I spoke to him, and told him my thoughts of me getting one behind his back. He doesn’t blame me, but he did state his concerns once again.

And yes, maybe this is me slowly giving up on my dream job and just trying to make this life more bearable. But it is what it is.

94,1d6bllp,AITA For asking my ex roommate to pay for something I lost?,"Okay there’s a lot of context I need to provide so bear with me. So back in December of last year I was kicked out of my university for grades. At the time I was no contact with my family so I was effectively going to be homeless after losing my uni housing. My work friend at the time offered to let me move in and sleep on her couch as she was moving apartments in January right around when my housing would fall through. So I moved in. The apartment was very messy but I thought that was just because of moving and it would change, it didn’t. It got worse over time. My roommate was working full time and I was part time so I was doing all the housework (dishes, scooping her cats litter boxes, feeding the cats, etc.) and the apartment was still disgusting. I was given a small walk in closet to put all of my things and slept on her couch so I put my stuff away as best I could with the space I was given. Two months later it looked like she had still moved in less than a week ago. At the beginning of March I went on a week long trip with three of my former college roommates for their Spring Break. When I got back the house was in shambles. The dishes were piling up, the trash was overflowing onto the floor and worst of all the cat boxes didn’t look like they’d been cleaned since I last did it before I left. She has three cats, there was cat shit EVERYWHERE. All of this I ended up cleaning up with no complaints only to receive a text from her while I was at a friends house a couple weeks later telling me I needed to move out. Her parents were going through a nasty divorce and her dad kicked her mom out so she offered to let her mom move in with her and told me I had two weeks to find a new place to live. It is nearly impossible to find an entire new apartment in two weeks especially when she knew I was not in a place financially to be able to get an apartment by myself. Luckily I ended up finding some friends that were looking for a place and asked if they wanted another roommate. They said yes and let me move in with them. So now I have been moved out of her apartment for two months and a few of my things are still missing because her apartment was filthy and they got lost underneath piles of her stuff. I asked her if she could look for my stuff and she said yes but as soon as I asked if she could give me money for the things that she put away that I no longer have she began ignoring my text messages. Money is tight and I t would cost me around $150 for me to replace everything that I lost. She is way more financially stable than I am but as soon as I asked her to pay for things she effectively lost she stopped talking to me even though we remained friends after I moved out. So AITA for asking her to find or pay for things I lost in her apartment?

Edit: For everyone mentioning the trip I went on in the comments. That trip was planned and paid for back in September when I still had and was not worried about housing and the costs were split between me and three other friends. The trip itself was about $200 per person. It wasn’t a lavish vacation. 

Also she put my things away. When I say I lost them I meant they were lost in her apartment. She is the one who moved them while I was not home without my permission. 

All my friends that I’ve talked to about this that have seen her apartment and met her are telling me I’m in the right. My new roommates say that I was “living in a hoarder house”. I understand that this is Reddit but I feel like I’m being more harshly judged than I should be for being a “live in maid” as my bf put it.

When it arrived, my daughter asked what it was. I laughed and told her it was marshmallow fluff as I put it on my burrito. She gave me a skeptical look, laughed, and said, “You’re lying, Mom. There’s no way.” We went back and forth for a while, with me encouraging her to try it if she didn’t believe me. She kept laughing and insisting she knew I was lying. Finally, she grabbed the container, dipped her finger in, tasted it, and immediately gagged and spit it into her napkin. She exclaimed that she knew I was lying and scolded me for deceiving her before we continued with our meal. 

My mom kept giving me disapproving looks, and yesterday she told me it was wrong to prank my daughter like that. She said my daughter should be able to trust me 100% and that it was mean. I explained that we had been laughing the whole time and that my daughter has been telling her friends how I pranked her and how funny it was. I don’t think it’s a big deal—it was just family fun—but my mom is making a huge fuss over it. I asked her dad if he thought it was mean, and he said she should have known better than to think there was marshmallow fluff on a burrito.

ETA: I have answered this a few times, so I’m just gonna put it up here now. I checked in with my daughter on the drive home that night and I asked her if she was OK with that and if she was upset, and she said it was a great prank and she definitely wasn’t upset, the only thing that upset her was she only meant to get a tiny swipe, not a massive glob. We are very open with our feelings and my family and she has no problem expressing if she feels that she’s been wronged or if her feelings have been hurt. And she did get me back the next night when we had pizza, she switched out a ranch cup for a cup of mayonnaise and laughed herself silly.

A kid (15-16m) who isn’t a bully necessarily, but a cunt, was taking the piss out of me. I didn’t care too much, but it was the principle.

He was saying things like “ oh yea they look ugly tho, my dentist said I should probably get them but I said no  and I’m glad I did because yours look shit”

So I simply replied “ I think you made the wrong decision about the braces man.”

He got all pissy saying I was bullying him for his looks, but it’s say it’s even, ya know?

100,1d6a53v,AITA for telling my mom's husband he could try growing up and not being such a dick?,"My mom has a messy history and gave me a very messy history as a result. 

BG on my mom: She was married for over 11 years. They had trouble having kids. Turned out the husband had a very low sperm count (I think that's the right terminology). They tried IVF and other fertility help but my mom couldn't get pregnant. They were depressed. Her husband didn't want to use donor sperm to have a kid. He didn't want to raise a child not genetically his. So my mom decided she would find a ""donor"" behind his back, aka she cheated on him, with guys that apparently looked enough like him so she could pass the kid off as his. She confided in her sister, my aunt. It was three guys, one night stands with each, all of them had the same physical characteristics of the husband. He was overjoyed when she got pregnant and then my aunt told him the truth. He'd had doubts but felt bad about accusing her of cheating but hearing it was enough for him to say he wanted no part of this. They did a DNA anyway because there was a chance I was his but I wasn't and he divorced my mom and did not take any kind of role in my life.

My mom never got over her ex. She has loved him all this time and I'm 17 now. I have met her ex. She set up these circumstances for him to see us in the hopes he would fall in love with me. But he never wanted any part of it and then he got married again and actually had a bio kid (apparently confirmed with DNA).

Then when I was 11 my mom got remarried. She doesn't love her husband, I'm not even sure she really likes him. She's trying to get over her ex. Her husband knows this. He also knows she slept around to have me. And he hates it and I get the brunt of it. He's always such a dick to me. He acts like I wanted to meet mom's ex and be paraded in front of him like some sort of doll. He gets annoyed when I ask my mom for any info on the guys she slept with (I would like to know who my bio father is). He gets annoyed that mom put her ex on my birth certificate. He hates that I have the ex's last name. He brings these things up so much. As well as telling me I should be nicer to mom because when she mentions her ex I tell her she should get past it.

Mom's husband was in such a bad mood Friday because my mom found out her ex and his wife and kid moved away. He told me that I should change my name and birth certificate now and stop holding onto some random guys info. I told him I'm 17, that's not something I can change yet, it's up to his wife. He told me I'm always so difficult and always rubbing his face in shit. He told me I could try being more understanding. I told him he could try growing up and not being such a dick to me when I don't have control over shit my mom does or has done in the past. He told me I have no right to speak to him, an adult, like that.

i saw her do this and so did some of our other friends, and we asked her if she had gotten caught doing this before, which she said no to. she also warned us and said she wouldn’t want to get us into trouble and said that we’re doing it at our own risk and she warned us.

obviously im panicking because i didnt know what they would do
sooner or later the principal comes in and starts checking everyones arms, and me and our other friends get caught and taken to the principals office.
while we’re in there and she’s lecturing us, i noticed Sarah wasn’t in there.
the principal said that we now had to go home and she’d take us back with her tomorrow to discuss punishment
when we left her office, i saw Sarah and asked her why she didn’t go to the principals office, to which she said that she managed to get the writing off before they checked

104,1d68yj2,AITA for being rude towards my BIL? ," (BIL refers to my brother's wife's brother to avoid confusion)

My (18M) family went to a feast held at my SIL's Family and for context my BIL is 31 years old so there is a lot of age difference. The feast also was divided between males and females within the house and us males were 9-10 people in the room and this happened in that room.

Before we sat down to eat, we all were joking around and everyone was talking amongst themselves making conversation and I was using my phone but also following the conversation with some attention. My BIL was then telling us about how his wife loves cooking and makes amazing food items and I, with my negative IQ but also following the conversation, jokingly said ""yeah we can see that"" 🤦‍♂️ and he just chuckled then moved along the conversation. For info he is NOT overweight at all (his stomach bulging out etc nothing) but I would say he is quite bulky naturally without bodybuilding and such.

The second instance is when all the convos etc were done, he brought out the food in a tray (rice item) which was ordered from a restaurant but he joked around saying yeah I made it (it very obviously wasn't) and when the rice ran out he went into the kitchen to refill it. It took him well over 5-6 minutes to refill the tray and we were all just sitting idly waiting for the rice (not complaining and still had a joking mood in the room amongst ourselves) and when he came back with the tray I again jokingly said ""did you went to refill it or cook it again"" (not exact translation it was much less formal in my language) referring to the earlier joke but this time he smiled and just handed the tray down and I realized I embarrassed him a little bit? Like yk the feeling when you kept the guests waiting as the host (again we were not complaining it was chill with us).

Last context,  before this me and BIL had two conversation (I tend to keep to myself and not indulge in conversations) and they were serious ones (he asked what my career plans were and I asked him for studies advice since we are in the same field) and my biggest concern which makes me the asshole IMO is the age difference between us and it was really disrespectful of me to be so frank with him especially since he hadn't joked around before and he is literally almost double my age.

So reddit AITA?

Edit: No one mentioned it to me that I was being rude to him but after the second ""joke"" and realizing from his kinda embarrassed face, I kept my mouth shut to stop myself from overstepping my boundaries with him.

Edit 2: For people asking of my culture, I am from a Desi culture where respect for elders over anything so that made me realize I was rude to my elder.

106,1d6833x,WIBTA if I asked my GF to start pitching in for rent and doing more around the house (despite her not technically living there)?,"For about 2 years already I (M20) and my GF (F20) of 3 years have followed about the following routine:

I wake up, go to work. She wakes up and leaves for classes (could be as early as 8 am and as late as 2 pm, depending on her schedule). Then after her classes she goes home (her home, to her parent's house), has dinner there and comes back around 6-7 pm. On the weekends she is at my place 24/7.

For these entire 2 years I have paid all of the rent, done all the cleaning, bought all the groceries and everything else that is needed to be done around the house (now remembering, I even paid for her parking pass that's needed for the apartment). I never really asked her to do any of that, though she hasn't offered either.

I am right now out of the state for a trip (during which she usually stays at my place, she has a spare and comes and goes into the apt as she wants) and got hit with a rent increase notice via email. I had some time to reconsider everything and thought that after coming back I'd like to ask her to do the following:

* Pitch in $150 a month of rent (the rent is $1900)
* Vacuum once a week (usually I do it, so I am not inventing this chore just as a punishment)
* Buy small amount of groceries (less than $20 a month)

Though I feel like it is ""the right"" or ""an okay"" thing to ask I also feel a bit conflicted because it is technically ""my apartment"" and she has ""her own house"" at her parent's place. So in a sense I feel like I'd be asking her to contribute to the apartment that's not hers. I feel a bit asshole'ish about it, but at the same time I got a bit tired of doing the work for 2 people.

Please don't take anything I said here as a jab against my GF, she is a wonderful person, I just never talked this out with her before.

I had some time to reconsider everything and thought that after coming back I'd like to ask her to do the following:

* Pitch in $150 a month of rent (the rent is $1900)
* Vacuum once a week (usually I do it, so I am not inventing this chore just as a punishment)
* Buy small amount of groceries (less than $20 a month)

Though I feel like it is ""the right"" or ""an okay"" thing to ask I also feel a bit conflicted because it is technically ""my apartment"" and she has ""her own house"" at her parent's place. So in a sense I feel like I'd be asking her to contribute to the apartment that's not hers. I feel a bit asshole'ish about it, but at the same time I got a bit tired of doing the work for 2 people.

Please don't take anything I said here as a jab against my GF, she is a wonderful person, I just never talked this out with her before.

EDIT: Realized it could be important. She has no job and no expenses. She receives a decent allowance from her parents and all of her expenses (gas/school tuition/food/medical/etc) are all covered",0.0,0.9902161955833435,1,0
107,1d67sr6,AITA - for uninviting my STEP SL from my wedding?,"My (22)M fiancé and I (24)F wedding is coming up this winter. It’s a small venue with limited space. Luckily we still were able to invite everyone that’s important to us. We decided on a no small children wedding due to the venue size and photographer equipment safety. (We have a huge security deposit on it.) Don’t get us wrong we absolutely love children. If we weren’t paying for it all ourselves and if we had a bigger venue we’d been more than happy to accommodate the children as well. We’ve been trying to conceive ourselves. Sadly once ending in a miscarriage.

Fast-forward to the day everyone starts receiving their invitations. My fiancé’s STEP sister received her invite and instead of coming to us about her concerns. She calls 5 family members telling them “how dare we request for no children under the age of 10 to attend.” (She has a 9y and 11m)
By the time she called us we had already heard from 3 of his family members about how upset she was about it. 

She belittled us saying things like “If I can’t bring them I’m not coming! It’s not my fault y’all have failed to become parents” etc. until my fiancé was on the verge of tears. He’s not a crier. He really wanted her to be there. So after over 10 mins of the nonsense, I told her she can bring them but that she is to sit in the back. 

She’s always been the drama starter including asking my ask my fiancé if she could wear a white dress TO MY WEDDING since my dress is technically ivory. He told her no, gave her the list of colors she can wear. Her words “oh gosh, your wedding colors are gross” (it’s our 2 favorite colors and used in weddings a lot). Then proceeded to tell my fiancé he needed to postpone the wedding so she can have one last Christmas with “her family”.

Now here’s where I may the asshole. 
She tried to tell, not ask but told me her kids were my ring bearer and flower girl. When I asked her when did we ever agree to that? She said “well I assumed…. “ I snapped and said “well you know what assuming does it makes an ass outta u and me” she looked at me crazy. I said “you better be glad we are even allowing them at the wedding, do not push our courtesy invite or I will be more than happy to revoke it.”

 My fiancé walked in right after that and the comment about the white dress came to mind. I switched back to her and stated loud and clear to her “and if you show up in that white dress you were asking about be prepared to go home in a red one”. My fiance laughed and his step sister stormed out.

Now we are getting calls from his step family saying we bullied her into not wearing a dress she liked…when we questioned them well it seems she never clarified that it was white to any of them… guess that slipped her mind…..some still think we need to apologize to her because “she seems really upset about it”.  At this point we are thinking about inviting them.

111,1d677uc,WIBTA For taking my dads car from my child’s mother,"I (22M) split from my child’s mother (22F) of our 2 year relationship on January 1st, 2024. Leading up to this we had our last argument in November 2023. I was in the wrong, I lied about something. I put us in a lot of tuff situations. She always tried to make sure we were okay and I let her down financially and emotionally.

I lost my job in December a couple days before Christmas. We were staying with her parents when everything happened and the last thing she wanted them to find out was I lost my job. So new years I moved out. The agreement was that I move out and she’d give me 3 months to take initiative and just
See some growth. So her birthday ended up coming up in February and she was expecting me to show up. But the discussion we had was that she was going out with her family. So for me the most I could do at the time with limited resources was send her a heart felt message. She was supposedly anticipating my arrival because they stayed home but I “no showed” because I didn’t know this information she didn’t mention it when I text her

Fast forward to April she’s moved out of her parents house and in with a supposedly guy friend (23M) but I found out that for her birthday because I didn’t show she had went out with him and slept with him but before found out all this info she asked to use my dad’s back up vehicle which I was using after I got in a wreck in my car. She’s still currently in the vehicle and we’re still legally married but she stays with him. She’s also mentioned to him because he asked that in the event that I get myself together that she’d leave him in a blink of an eye but he proceeds to let her stay. He rides in my dad’s vehicle and she doesn’t tell me but I’m sure he drives it. Maybe this should be the smallest fish to fry or not my main concern. WIBTA if I took the vehicle back from her to establish myself to possibly change my situation?


ALSO: I’ve accepted all my F ups and she’s free to do what she wants I have no control of that. She said she wants to hopefully get back together in the future if it doesn’t work out right now. I’m not betting on it… just adding.

113,1d66hww,AITA for shaving my head without telling my family?,"I (19F) just finished my freshman year of college. My grandmother (82F) is, unfortunately, in the later stages of cancer and is not expected to live much longer. We were very close when I was a child, much of which was because I am her only granddaughter, which is something she had always wished to have. One of the ways we bonded was through my hair. I had it very long, all the way down my back, and she loved how it looked like hers did when she was a kid. I was repeatedly told my whole life, especially by my grandmother, to never cut it as it was beautiful.

I came out as a lesbian at 16 and started to take on more of a masculine appearance, and in turn, my self confidence became a lot stronger, but it also definitely alienated me from my family. They're not super homophobic by any means, but they're definitely uncomfortable with the idea of be being gay, especially because I'm the only girl. Through those last few years of high school, despite wearing masculine clothes and getting and undercut in my hair, I still kept my super long hair. My parents didn't love this new look, but never tried to stop me.

Going to college far away from where I grew up has allowed me to embrace the look i'm going for a little more, and the obvious step for me was to cut my hair. It was something that I had wanted to do for years, and so in April, right after I returned to campus from spring break, I had a friend of mine shave all of my hair off, knowing I wouldn't have to face the consequences with my family for another month or so when I came home from college. I love my shaved head. I feel so much more like myself without all that hair weighing me down, and I donated all of my hair.

I was incredibly nervous for my family to see me without my hair. I was too nervous to tell my parents, so it came as a shock to them when my dad picked me up at the airport and saw me. His immediate concern was that this trip home could very well be the last time I see my grandmother and it would absolutely break her heart to see me without my hair. When I got home, my mom was absolutely livid. She said that it was incredibly selfish of me to do this when I knew I was going to come see my grandmother who loved my hair, and that it was unfair to have her last image of her only granddaughter being, in her words, ""an ugly tomboy hairdo.""

I feel absolutely awful, because while I did this for me and I feel great about the haircut, it breaks my heart to think about my grandmother and what I did to her by doing this, as the first thing she always used to do when she saw me was tussle my hair and compliment it. My parents are still very angry at me, and so are my brothers, because my grandmother is our matriarch and we are all trying to do everything we can to make her happy and comfortable at the end of her life.

They are all saying that I should have at least waited for her to pass first before I cut my hair. AITA for not considering this when I chose to shave my head?",0.0,-0.012574361637234688,0,1
114,1d664mk,AITA for making my brother in law,"Hey folks,

So my wife and I got a place together and we were originally going to let me sister live with us for 1-2 years as her place was still under construction and would help us with our mortgage, however wife in the end decided that she did not want that living arrangement so we ultimately said no due inconvenience and being wary of another female. Then the topic of her brother came up where he was just getting his life started in a professional sense and needed to save for his own place and asked if her brother could move in which is why we are currently charging him $500 in a HCOL area (Market is double). I said yes thinking we were doing her bro a big solid. 

He said he would be on his best behaviour, help clean and try not to inconvenience us but proceeded to stay in the dining room at night and sleep on the couch until we told him not to.. We’ve asked him multiple times to clean common areas and take out the trash which he does but after a while but gets less consistent over time claiming he is busy and has no time. There have been long periods where he hasn’t done it despite being at home all day until again we tell him to do it.
Another issue is that he keeps chasing our dog and giving food to him behind our backs when we have communicated to him not to do that multiple times. We dont want the pup to have bad habits of running away from us and we dont know what he feeds the dog too.. other than the bread I caught him in the act.

So today as I was cleaning I found the microwave have dried stains and food in there of which I had to clean and I had enough and basically informed my wife and her bro that he has to move out. He was saying I should communicate to him what he needs to clean and whatever but I’m think you are a full grown adult, you use items that others use why wouldn’t you clean it otherwise who is going to clean it? We’ve told him to do things multiple times for different things too. Mind you these issues aren’t isolated and have occurred many times for the past year.

My wife is upset at me and thinks I’ve ruined their relationship and when we were talking amongst the 3 of us I felt that they were both ganging up on me for being so cold and heartless for making him move out. They also told me I should stop bringing up past issues that we have had but in my mind all of these things are adding up. Bro in law also asked me, “are you sure you aren’t going to regret how you treated me for the rest of your life”.

I (F29) am getting married in a week. My fiancé and I have chosen to have a childfree wedding, with no one under the age of 12 being invited to attend. This impacted a few people but no one really raised much issue with it,  my friend 'Lisa' (F28) has a 6 month old son and has organised to have her mother babysit.

My soon to be SIL is pregnant, due a couple of weeks after our wedding. Well, she isn't pregnant anymore, she has just had her baby. She still wants to attend, and we want her to come as well, so we are bending the rules and allowing her to bring along the baby.

Lisa saw the facebook announcement and called me to have a 'random' chat, that very quickly turned into her pestering me about SIL and the wedding. When I mentioned that she was still coming, she acted all confused and asked about the baby. I didn't think much of it, and told her the truth.

She got pretty miffed and started asking if she could bring her son too. I said no, that we still want a mostly child free wedding and SIL is a close family exception. She is now calling me an asshole, saying that I'm playing favourites and that I should be more accommodating to all new mothers.

She wasn't happy about the childfree wedding to begin with, but came around to it and settled on her mother babysitting. But now SIL is bringing her newborn, she is really upset and a few of our shared friends have sent messages asking why I can't just accommodate her the same way I'm accommodating my SIL.

He didn't take part in raising me since he and my mom divorced when I was 2 and we moved away, but we've been in and out of contact my whole life. He would send letters and then move, change his number, set up visits to us and never show up, quit paying child support, etc. We've talked on and off throughout the years but it always ends in arguments.

I can be pretty subborn and argumentative, so I don't tend to let things go if I don't feel like I have closure. This is where I'm starting to feel like the asshole. A few years ago in the Fall, I got pregnant and was stoked. I told him the news after being out of contact with him, and he was very excited too and booked a trip to come visit me around Christmas. Unfortunately, it was an extremely rough pregnancy for me. I got hyperemisis, lost 20 pounds, and had a miscarriage. I miscarried about a month before he was scheduled to come visit.

When I told him the news, he seemed sad at first, but then he stopped talking to me for about a week. About a week after I told him, he cancelled his trip to visit, saying he had Covid. (The trip wasn't for another 4 weeks, so I was confused but didn't push it). When the time for him to visit rolled around and I hadn't heard from him much, I saw him partying with his new girlfriend at a bar. I got extremely upset and blocked him on everything without saying a word to him. My miscarriage was also complicated and I had to have two surgeries to avoid getting sepsis. The whole thing was incredibly traumatic, and I was very hurt by him not showing up.

Fastforward to today, I've established contact with him again. He reached out to me on LinkedIn of all places, so I got worried something was up. Nothing was up, he just wanted to talk. He didn't ask how I was doing, he didn't ask if I'm okay, he just wanted to ""talk to his daughter"". We made small talk over a few weeks until he brough up my miscarriage off-handedly and I kind of went off on him. 

He keeps saying he can't fix the past and he made mistakes, and he also tells me he was working a lot and that he had it really rough. He keeps saying he doesn't want to argue and he just wants to talk to his daughter, and that makes me feel a bit bad.

My son’s 2nd bday was coming up and I didn’t want to throw party since he wouldn’t remember it. Instead my parents and sisters decided we would go to Disneyland. As his birthday came closer, my Tia and my son’s other grandma, who werent going to Disney, asked if they could throw him a bday party. I obviously said yes. Both of them told me to not worry about money or to plan the party, since I was already going to Disney. My son’s grandma told me I could invite whoever but she also kept asking how many people I was inviting because she was scared she wasn’t going to have enough food. I have a large family and so does my son’s dad so I invited my immediate family (10 adults plus there kids). I also invited 1 of my cousins who’s outside of my immediate family because I am really close to his wife, Jenny, and we are gym partners. I didn’t think it was a big deal. 

Jenny ended up posting a video of us singing happy birthday and a few hours later, Heather texted me “thanks for inviting me to the party!” Obviously it was a sarcastic tone and I explained that I wasn’t trying to invite a lot of people since it wasn’t my party. When you invite her you also have to invite her parents and siblings which is another 10-15 people. I apologized if she felt left out and it wasn’t my intention to leave her out. I told her we were having another party at my Tia house tomorrow that she’s more than welcome to come to. She didn’t come and hasnt talked to me much since (the parties were in February)

Since then, she invited me to her son’s birthday and have seen her at different family parties. We’ve had a few conversions about work but doesnt respond to my text messages like she use to. Jenny told me she was confiding in her about how she’s still upset about not being invited and feels like I purposely don’t invite her to the gym or other events, which isn’t the case. She also said I act different since me and my bf (sons dad) got back together (which I don’t think I do lol)and I’m not a good godmother to her kid. My Jenny told Heather  that she should reach out to me because she thinks there is a miss understanding but Heather said it’s not worth her time because this has been happening since we were kids… She hasn’t talked to me about it and I tried to invite her to another event to make sure she doesn’t feel left out. She hasn’t replied to the invite and I doubt she will go. 

Some of my cousins are saying I should take the high road and reach out to her to have a sit down conversion to ease the tension. Others are saying who cares and let her talk because this isn’t the first time she’s acted like this towards me. Tbh I feel like it wouldn’t be productive but I’m really not sure what to do.

120,1d65t6y,AITA for buying the same vape system as my best friend?,"This is my first ever reddit post, I’m not really a reddit user and I don’t know how to use it. Honestly just looking for opinions. 

Sorry for writing about something so minimal but last weekend, my best friend (21F) and I (21F) hung out and she showed me her new vape system.  She was telling me about how it’s small and the pod is top of the line in the “vape industry” (idk what to call it). We both had the same systems before, but she bought her new one about two days before we hung out. 

Now today, I figured my old system was, well, getting old so I wanted to get what my b.f got or at least something similar. I texted her asking what hers was called and where she got it, and she told me not to get the same one as her. I tried my best to find a different one I liked, but I genuinely only found interest in the one she got as it’s small and cute. So, I got the same one but in a different colour. 

She followed up with me a couple hours later to ask what I ended up getting, and I told her I got the same one. You could just tell she wasn’t too happy (her responses were “bruh” and dry), and when I asked if she was upset, she explained that she was because she enjoyed having something different and how everyone has the same system nowadays.

I apologized of course, since she did tell me beforehand not to get the same one, but I didn’t think it’d be THAT big of a deal since it’s literally just a vape lol. So I guess my question is, AITA for getting the same system as my b.f? I don’t want to seem like a copycat, and I truly didn’t have any negative intentions picking the same system as her. I just find the whole thing immature imo. She’s being dry and overall not responding to me anymore, but I don’t want to be on bad terms with her because of this (even though it literally sounds stupid lmao)

I tried my best to find a different one I liked, but I genuinely only found interest in the one she got as it’s small and cute. So, I got the same one but in a different colour. 

She followed up with me a couple hours later to ask what I ended up getting, and I told her I got the same one. You could just tell she wasn’t too happy (her responses were “bruh” and dry), and when I asked if she was upset, she explained that she was because she enjoyed having something different and how everyone has the same system nowadays.

I apologized of course, since she did tell me beforehand not to get the same one, but I didn’t think it’d be THAT big of a deal since it’s literally just a vape lol. So I guess my question is, AITA for getting the same system as my b.f? I don’t want to seem like a copycat, and I truly didn’t have any negative intentions picking the same system as her. I just find the whole thing immature imo. She’s being dry and overall not responding to me anymore, but I don’t want to be on bad terms with her because of this (even though it literally sounds stupid lmao)

i have been researching and working towards getting into my dream school since 5th grade, and since college application season is on the rise again, i am really locking in and trying to get things together (first gen college student so it’s new to everyone). i was talking to my 8f sister casually, and she mentioned that this would be my last summer as a true teenager. i was like “haha yeah, can’t believe that i’ll likely be across the country in less than a year or so” - my sister went silent and then she started to break down. i immediately started asking her what was wrong and if she needed something. she just hugged me and we stood there for a bit until my mother came.

him that “[my name] is guilting [sister] and trying to turn her against us, and she’s showing me attitude!!”

I (18M), my mom (47F), my dad (46M), and my brother (14M) all sat down earlier tonight to watch Godzilla Minus One, which had just been added to Netflix where we live. We don't know any Japanese, and we watched the subbed version and not the dubbed version. Amazing movie! However, the conflict in question arose because my brother was constantly repeating the Japanese voicelines in a tone that was clearly intended to be humourous, and it came off to me as mockery, as well as just a general annoyance for the rest of us trying to watch the movie. I got the sense that my brother thought the Japanese voicelines sounded weird and wanted to make fun of them, which really bothered me because anyone with self-awareness understands they would only sound ""weird"" to people who don't speak the Japanese language. English would sound similarly weird to a Japanese person who's unfamiliar with it.

After the movie ended, I told my brother that he was being an annoyance by mockingly repeating the voicelines and that he was coming off as insensitive. I tried not to be rude about it, because I know he's not that old, but I did want to make sure he understood that he shouldn't do this sort of thing in the future. My brother didn't say anything, and my parents said I was overreacting and that I didn't have to raise the issue at all. I decided I'd said my peace already, and everyone dispersed to head to sleep (it was late at that point). I'm trying to understand where my parents were coming from here. Do you think I should've let it go or maybe just phrased what I said in a more polite manner? I feel like I *could* have been more polite, but I stand by the basics of what I said and fail to see why I shouldn't have brought it up in the first place.

EDIT: I'd like to clarify something that I don't think was clear enough already in the post, since some commentors have come away from this with the idea that I think my brother was being racist, or called him racist, or called his behaviour racist. That's not the case. I said his behaviour was coming off as insensitive, regardless of his intentions, and I don't believe it's a racial issue necessarily. We are all Caucasian and I would have said the same if we had been watching a foreign film from another primarily Caucasian country and he had made fun of the language in question then. My brother has never to my knowledge discriminated against any person of a different race, so that really isn't what this is about.",No A-holes here,2024-06-02,"AITA for calling my brother out for mockingly repeating Japanese voicelines in Godzilla Minus One?

She is a book lover which is fine but personally I always feel like she is talking down to me because of it.

I told her in a humorous but mostly true way something like ""Oh I haven't really read a book since like senior year of high school"" She just looked at me almost with pity.

Later on, she would start requesting me books to read but I just declined, and it soon turned condescending. She would say stuff like ""I don't know if you've heard of the cat in the hat but it's a really good book!"" She would say she was joking but it didn't feel like it.

I've been working there for a few months now and last Friday some of us had gone out together and she was there. I was a few drinks in and she was talking about Moby Dick and I just blurted ""I read Moby Dick!"" because I had before. She asked when I read it I told her a few years ago I listened to the audio book. She was like ""Okay so you didn't *readdddd* it"". 

We got into a little bit of an argument over it even though it was all so stupid but she ended up saying to me ""No guys are gonna like you if you have to lie to them about things as simple as reading"". Ummm what??? What I said to her in return may have not been my kindest words I'll admit but I said something like ""Look I know that you really really want to, but you can't fuck a book."" She didn't even say a word to me she just left. I felt really bad at first but now I don't think what I said was even that messed up.

124,1d65iab,AITA For telling my mom I avoid single mothers?," For context, my mother and I are both fairly conservative Christians and have been our whole lives. My parents split when I was 10.  I'm 23, and she's 44.
She met Andrew, who has been essentially my stepfather since 2014.

 While watching a movie, she made a comment about single mothers. (Can't remember her exact words)
I mentioned something about my knowledge about single mothers and how I generally try to avoid them as I'm not particularly interested in being in a relationship with a woman who's had children already. 

This surprised and upset my mother. As Andrew was willing to be in a relationship with her despite her having 3 kids. (Although she didn't have custody of me and my younger siblings for the first 2 years they were together)

 When my father got arrested and we were taken in by Cps, my mom was on the other side of the country getting her life together,  clean for 2 years. 

When she got that phone call about us, Andrew stepped up to the plate and started looking for a house that could accommodate everyone while she flew out to take custody of us.

Since then, he's gone above and beyond the call of duty taking care of my mother emotionally, financially. Putting a roof over our heads and food in our mouths.
It takes a special kind of man to do what he's done, and I'm ever grateful and respectful of him. 

I should also note that my mother's father walked out on her and my grandma when she was a kid. My grandpa met her soon after through her church, and they got married.

Despite these wonderful men in my life, I still look at single mothers, and it's hard to see them and not their mistakes. (NOT that the children aren't mistakes, but I generally view having kids young as a bad idea)

When he plays, he's always on discord with his friends. We're long distance right now and so I don't expect him to call me all the time but when he does, I ask can we have quality time but instead he plays this game and talks to his friends. I'll be talking and mid sentence he interrupts me to talk about this game to his friends.

A week ago, I was trying to tell him how I felt about it and he wasn't listening at all because he was too focused on the game. When I told him he told me that he didn't see a problem and that I couldn't just let him be happy or that I won't accept that he's having fun without me and that all I do is complain when he is playing and I should just let him have this one thing. That really hurt my feelings because I give up a lot of him. I stopped talking to some of my friends for him (which is do regret so pls don't make me feel bad about that) and a lot of other things. 

He was talking to his friends a few days ago when he called me and so I asked him to get off the game for a few and he did for about 10 minutes. During the call with him, I asked how did his friends feel about me and he said that he would just ask. I said that I didn't want them to know that I was on call with him and he said okay. For context, he has on his airpods and his gaming headphones so I can hear when they talk. But anyways, he asked and they said that I wasn't worth it and that I should just be a good girlfriend and let him enjoy the game and other things like that and the entire time they were laughing and he was laughing right along with them. 

So yesterday, I was talking to him and we tried to come up with compromises and he still couldn't put his controller down long enough to listen to what I had to say. Today, we were talking and he wanted to show me something and suggested that I just get added to the discord with him and his friends and I said no just screen share and he said no i'll add you. So while he was screen sharing, he asked his leader could I join and he said no because I was just going to start problems like I always do and that i'm just gonna be mad because I set them up and didn't like their answers. I asked him what did his leader mean by that and he said that he told all his friends that I was on the phone with him when he asked. I felt kind of betrayed because I asked him not to say anything. 

Also when we were talking about compromises for when he plays, I told him that we can just talk when he's not playing. He said he doesn't want to do that because he wants to talk to me while he plays. I told him that wasn't fair to me and when I asked him to come up with some compromises he just says that he wants to talk to me while he plays.

I have a friend at school that I am in a love-hate relationship with. The friend is the kind of friend that generally tends to think quite negatively but also help make you a better person in terms of achievement. The friend is someone who is quite insecure so they tend to not be able to pay compliments or praise those around him and tends to be overly critical of those they are friends with.

Although they can be a good person, they make me feel very uncomfortable and sometimes I question if I want to continue to be friends with them. But recently, they have gotten nicer and kinder so its more comfortable being around them so.... IDK what to do!! :O (send help!!)

The kind of person I am:

I tend to agree to things I don't agree to because I am a people pleaser and I usually don't know how to say no. I do admit to breaking many promises in the past because I find it hard to prioritize my needs over someone else's which means I agree to things I never really wanted to do. At the same time, I lack honestly and clear communication, setting boundaries with people.

The promise I made and how it happened:

Note: This promise happened 5 months ago!

Usually we would save seats for each other but its highschool but I never really wanted to. (cough cough :|, because I am a people pleaser.). So one day, they came LATE to class but they were obviously angry at me for not saving them a seat. So I apologized because it hurts me to see a friend of mine hurt by my actions but at the time I didn't really want to be closer friend with them and wanted more distance. So in the apology I promised to save them seats in the future, but I haven't really kept the promise and I don't really want to keep the promise in the future. At the same time, they have started to see that I have not been saving them seats so they have stopped saving me seats too.

Although they can be a good person, they make me feel very uncomfortable and sometimes I question if I want to continue to be friends with them. But recently, they have gotten nicer and kinder so its more comfortable being around them so.... IDK what to do!! :O (send help!!)

The kind of person I am:

I tend to agree to things I don't agree to because I am a people pleaser and I usually don't know how to say no. I do admit to breaking many promises in the past because I find it hard to prioritize my needs over someone else's which means I agree to things I never really wanted to do. At the same time, I lack honestly and clear communication, setting boundaries with people.

The promise I made and how it happened:

Note: This promise happened 5 months ago!

Usually we would save seats for each other but its highschool but I never really wanted to. (cough cough :|, because I am a people pleaser.). So one day, they came LATE to class but they were obviously angry at me for not saving them a seat. So I apologized because it hurts me to see a friend of mine hurt by my actions but at the time I didn't really want to be closer friend with them and wanted more distance. So in the apology I promised to save them seats in the future, but I haven't really kept the promise and I don't really want to keep the promise in the future. At the same time, they have started to see that I have not been saving them seats so they have stopped saving me seats too. So maybe I am making a big deal about it since I made this promise so long ago and so I don't have to save seats for them in the future? Or I am being a asshole for not keeping the promise?",2.0,1.001295566558838,1,0
128,1d64gal,AITA for complaining to my family that someone I was talking to had a spitting problem?,"For context, I (F) have a habit of interrupting conversations when the person I am speaking to has some food on their face or their hair is messed up. I do this because I wouldn't want to be talking to someone while I unknowingly look untidy.

Recently I have also been vocal about spitting. Now when I say spitting, I don't mean purposely spitting on someone but instead accidentally spitting out tiny bits of food while talking or getting saliva on your face from them talking to you. I've started mentioning every time this happens because I think that they're unaware. I myself had this issue, and I would always be very embarrassed and ashamed whenever someone pointed it out to me while I was talking to them yet would still be grateful that they let me know in the first place rather than not telling me at all.

I was at a family get together in a restaurant when I bumped into an old family friend (F) who I hadn't seen in years. We never expected to see each other so we were both very surprised. I was in the middle of a conversation with my cousin (M) when I got a tap on my shoulder from her. We started talking and everything was going well, but then a bit of her spit landed on my arm. Despite the fact that I would usually mention it, I ignored it because I hadn't seen her in so long and thought that it wouldn't be appropriate at that time.

We were only talking for around 5 minutes, but during those 5 minutes I must've had at least 7 different times where I had spit on me. Additionally, I noticed that some spit landed on my cousin when she began talking to him. After saying goodbye we parted ways for her to continue sitting at a table opposite from us. 

My cousin began asking me about her, saying that he vaguely remembers her but is still not exactly sure, so I explained how i've known her for many years and that he must have met her at some point. After that though, we moved on to a different topic and my friend wasn't mentioned by us again. About 10 minutes later, I get a few notifications on my phone and be being curious as to why I suddenly got so many I checked who it was from. It was from my friend, she was leaving and waved goodbye to me and others as she walked out from the restaurant. I didn't read the messages that she had said, instead waving to her and saying goodbye. Yet again, after that we didn't talk about her. 

Later on into the night my mother came up to me and my cousins to talk about the surprise encounter with my friend. As we were talking my mother mentioned how loud she was, and I agreed. After hearing her thoughts on the encounter, I mentioned how many times I had gotten spit on me when talking to her. 

My mother, bless her heart, spoke to me the next morning and began defending the girl saying that she didn't do it on purpose and was just very excited to see me. I tried explaining to her that I knew that but she kept on going, saying how rude it was for me to mention that in front of our family. so AITA in this situation?

129,1d64f3f,AITA for backing out of the family vacation?,"Back when my mom was alive, she loved  to travel. She bought into these ""timeshare points"". For those unfamiliar, ""points"" can be used to purchase time at various resorts around the country, and they renew annually. You also have to pay monthly maintenance fees. Now this isn't a gripe about timeshares being a scam. It's just something my mom bought into and is pertinent to the story.

My mother, had a pretty good job with a lot of vacation time, so throughout the year, Mom would take a friend or relative on these trips. Sometimes she'd even take my dad! Of course after Mom passed, my dad got the points and continued to pay those monthly fees.

Now my dad doesn't like to travel a lot, but he got the idea to blow all the points on as many units as he could get at one of their many resorts for one week out of the year, and he would take with him as many of our relatives as he could. The only expectation is that during the trip, everyone would chip in, and my dad pays for nothing. Considering how much money those maintenance fees are, my dad is being rather generous.

Naturally my dad always invites me to go along, but in the past I usually couldn't go because of work or other schedule conflicts, and to be honest, I really didn't want to go. After his last vacation, several relatives started wheedling me to go on the next one. It's not that they hadn't tried to talk me into it before, but this time they were being more adamant. I caved and said I would. Everyone was happy.

This year's destination is a beach resort. Where do I begin? So I tend to get sun poisoning very easily. No tan, no burn, just straight to blisters. Let me tell you, it's not fun. So maybe there's other things to do? Well, I could always sit at the bar and get drunk, but that doesn't really sound like a way to spend my week either. But hey, I hear the rooms are really nice!

Yeah, about that. So it looks like there's not really enough rooms, so they plan on sticking in a room with two of my adult nephews. They're decent enough guys, but I'm a middle aged man, and just to show how much he cares, my dad bought me an air mattress so I wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. How thoughtful!

I love seeing my relatives during the holidays, but there's a reason I live alone, and after that last little bit of news about their being too few rooms, I backed out, and now it seems like everyone is mad at me. Some, like my dad, are downright pissed and calling me ""ungrateful"". I kind of expected that, but even if I went, I'd probably be miserable and try to take everyone else with me.

137,1d63abz,AITA for reporting my housemate to the landlord for illegally switching tenant ? ,"The minimum stay (imposed by my landlord) is 6 months, and my housemate wanted to move in with his girlfriend, so he decided to find some rando online and did a swap agreement

This guy has not been through any proper checks, nor does my landlord know about it  
I fear that my stuff would be stolen, etc 

  
So I reported them to the landlord , they came in and asked the guy to leave or they'll call the police on him for trespassing 

I don't know what happened to my original housemate, he has probably lost his deposit and placed on a blacklist or whatever, but I was genuinely in fear of my personal safety and of my stuff being stolen
