0,1d76hon,AITA For sticking up for my friend?,"I (16F) am in high school as a sophomore. My friend, let’s call him Alex, is 16M, and he is trans from girl to guy. Me and him have been best friends for a good 11-12 years, so i’ve supported him no matter what. I will be honest, he does get into a lot of drama and argues with some people but besides that he is a pretty chill guy. So on Friday i walked out of my fifth hour to go get a snack from the vending machines. I walk past these two girls who have a history of being AH’s. I walk past them and they are saying how he isn’t a real boy and how he is stupid and how he gets on their nerves. Which okay, he gets on your nerves, i get that but what’s the point in being a transphobic person because he is getting on your nerves?? Makes no sense. But i get my snack and im walking back to my class and i pass then again and they are still talking about it, so at this point, i just give them a dirty look and move on with my day, except for the fact, one of the girls decided to say “Wow did you see the dirty look that B**** gave us??” So thats when i turn around and start yelling at both of them, mainly this one girl, let’s call her Brooklyn, she is not the nicest girl so im just going off on her saying shut up and why does him being trans have anything to do with her and all of that. The problem is when i get angry i cry, so when i feel the tears coming i walk away and k see my teacher walking towards us. She stops near me and asks me what happened and i explain to her the whole thing. Me and her take a lap around the school (our school is kind of a square shape), and i calm down and go back to class. She talks to the girls and informs the assistant principal. My mom said im not in trouble but im scared im going to be just for sticking up for my friend, AITA??

1,1d70nee,UPDATE: AITA for rejecting the worst name ever for our offspring?,"First, the good news: We have a beautiful, healthy baby girl! She weighed in at 7 lbs 4 oz and already has the most incredible head of dark hair (seriously, where did that come from?). Labor was a marathon, not a sprint — 18 hours of “fun” — but the amazing nurses kept me fueled up on ice chips and cheesy encouragement.

Now, for the not-so-good news: The name situation. Buckle up, because this might take a minute.

Right before pushing started, things got a little heated between me and Stuart. Apparently, the stress of contractions made him even more attached to “Stuarta.” He was pacing the room, muttering about “family legacy” while I was doing some very impressive Lamaze breathing exercises.

Suddenly, my water broke with a rather impressive *pop*. Let’s just say it startled everyone in the room, including Stuart. The nurse, bless her heart, took advantage of the distraction and very calmly started prepping for delivery.

Everything after that was a blur of pushing, encouraging words, and the most amazing head of dark hair emerging into the world. The second our daughter was out, screaming her little lungs out, a wave of pure, primal love washed over me.

It was in that moment, staring at this tiny, perfect human being, that the name debate completely evaporated. There was no way I could call this beautiful little girl “Stuarta.”

So, what did we end up with?

In the haze of post-partum bliss, I blurted out the first name that popped into my head — the name of the incredible nurse who’d coached me through labor: Ella.

Yes, Ella. Not exactly the most adventurous choice, but in that moment, it felt perfect. Strong, steady, kind — just like the woman who’d helped bring our daughter into the world.

Stuart, bless his confused heart, just looked at me, then at our daughter, then back at me again. Finally, he let out a shaky laugh and said, “Ella it is.”

Thanks for all the support and hilarious “Stuarta” comparisons.

2,1d6xrc5,AITA for wanting input on my girlfriend's future wedding dress?,"My girlfriend, Cindy, (AFAB-NB23) and I (27M) are not yet engaged, getting married, etc. but somehow it seems as if the matter of wedding dresses has become a major issue between us. We have very different styles in general—I’m more minimalist, they’re more eclectic—and that difference goes into wedding dresses. They prefer dresses with lots of ruffles, a long train, just generally a more classic wedding style. I prefer more simplistic dresses, but I’m willing to compromise.

We’ve looked at dresses together in the past, and every time we’ve been able to agree on certain dresses that we both like. Even so, every time I’ve absolutely hated their favorite dresses, and they’ve absolutely hated my favorite dresses. At first, I didn’t think it would be an issue, because we had some middle ground, but when I made it clear that I wanted to have at least some amount of input, my partner was extremely upset, even angry. Since I know choosing the dress is typically something of an event for the bride and maids of honor, I told them I just wanted a picture of the dress itself, not to actually come along if that was the issue.

However, Cindy made it very clear that I don’t get an opinion on the dress. Since it’s a once in a lifetime event, according to them, they get full license to choose the dress, and I have no say in it. I clarified, I don’t want to choose the dress, just have some input. While I want Cindy to feel beautiful, I want both of us to like the way the other looks. Still, even with that in mind, they made it clear that the dress is non-negotiable.

At the time, I basically said we would discuss it either in couples counseling or when the time comes to choose the dress. They grumbled about it, but we decided to drop the matter.

Now, we’re getting ready to move in together and just had a conversation about the future of our relationship. While there are definitely some issues that are going to be more difficult to navigate, they mentioned that I have some particular preferences that could be an issue. When I asked what, Cindy brought up the wedding dress. I said, again, I’m willing to compromise and find something we both like, and Cindy said, again, that I don’t get to have an opinion. I just don’t.

Since there were bigger issues, I basically just dropped it and said we could discuss it once we sort the rest out. We’ve both agreed that we want to get couples therapy in the future, so I hope that will help.

Now, I recognize that there are other parts to this, like seeing the bride in the dress being bad luck and the general ritual of the bride and bridesmaids and all. But am I the asshole for wanting input on my girlfriend’s future wedding dress? Is there something I’m missing?



Update: Thank you to those of you who commented. I think I was in a mindset of being involved 50/50 without realizing how much of a controlling asshole that made me. I'll talk with Cindy later, apologize, and see how we can work on things moving forward. To those saying I should focus on my own clothes instead, any suggestions for how to match the general vibe? like cravat, tails, top hat? Go for a funky steampunk vibe? Genuinely, I'd love some suggestions.

Separately though since there was a bit of understandable confusion in the comments, while Cindy is NB, they currently prefer the term girlfriend, and while my other post might seem contradictory, I've since realized I'm queer as well. I specified they were AFAB because I didn't want people think I was trying to stop their gender expression, when it accidentally came off the exact opposite.

3,1d6vslo,UPDATE: AITA for not allowing my fiancés BF come to our wedding? ,"Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ph0ln6I44a

Original BLUF: I told my fiancé his best friend can’t come to our wedding. She pretends I don’t exist & he does nothing to address it. 

The comments on my original post opened my eyes and made me realize that despite this being the healthiest relationship I’ve been in, it doesn’t mean it’s actually healthy. We’ve had a couple conversations surrounding this issue, which mostly consisted of me saying it bothered me & him saying he I was the only one who cared. 

A couple things helped me realize my breaking point-

1. I asked him if he would be okay with our daughters future partner treating them like this, to which he got flustered, shut down, and said he didn’t want to talk about it. (I left it alone) 

2. He said he didn’t want to end his friendship or do anything to jeopardize it because “what if we break up.” This made me realize he would not protect me as his wife, since he didn’t as his girlfriend. 

The final straw was when I expressed how much it bothered me that he wanted me to blow this off since we, as in me & the best friend, only see each other 4-6 times a year & he said (directly quoted because this is burned into my brain) : “I know the way she treats you is garbage, but you’re allowing one person to dictate our relationship.” 

“It could be worse. She could be more active. There are worse ways to meddle, people text and lie, and all that to break relationships up.”

The first line broke my heart and told me all I needed to know. I have to truck through a couple more months of pre-planned & paid for  social engagements, but I closed the curtain on any chance of healing this relationship the moment those words left his mouth. 

Thank you everyone for the advice, common sense, knocking me upside my head, and similar related experiences & outcomes. 

I’m gonna go to therapy & redefine what a healthy, balanced, and communicative relationship. 

EDIT: the preplanned events aren’t the wedding/ engagement related. We share a home, need to divide assets, pets, a custody schedule. Additionally we have vacations, planned with a mutually shared friend group (bf not part of that group). I appreciate the concerns but I need to plan things out a little more. There will be no second chance. 

To those that keep saying they’re fucking- probably . When I first brought this up, he became stressed & kept emphasizing how I thought he was fuckin his best friend, and didn’t address the issue that was brought up. I don’t care to know or confirm. 

EDIT 2: We are NOT getting married, continuing our relationship. For those thinking I’m using the preplanned events to justify holding out good- absolutely f*ckin not. Our relationship was dead the moment he admitted she treated my like garbage, and basically shrugged it off. 

As a note- I NEVER asked him to cut anyone off, out of his life. I simply asked for basic greetings & acknowledgment during the rare encounters with his BFF.  This hasn’t happened, aside from a couple of begrudging times

4,1d6uovn,UPDATE: AITA For Telling My Sister That She Shouldn't Overvalue Herself And Prepare For The Worse?,"Hey!

It's been a couple of weeks and due to people still occasionally asking I thought I'd give a people some quick updates to the situation. Here are the basic bullet points:

* My sister has now been officially diagnosed with Postpartum Depression and that is the trump card/Hail Mary of the situation.
* My sister and her husband are living together again and in couple's therapy.
* My sister is in individual counseling.
* My niece has now been officially introduced to a few members of her paternal size and they all love her.
* Jack's family have ceased their negative comments about my sister but she says that they're still pretty formal and distant towards her. I honestly don't know if she'll ever be in their good graces again and will only put up with her for my BIL and niece's sake.
* My niece's name first and middle is going to be legally changed to whatever Jack wants.
* For the next five years BIL's side of the family is getting priority when it comes to any and all holidays.
* My mom will be on a strict info diet when it comes to the baby. No pictures unless Jack approves.

This is all I know for right now and my mom is NOT happy with any of this and is calling Jack a controlling AH but my sister is holding firm in an effort to save her marriage. She claims that BIL and her are making progress in counseling and I hope for her sake that it's true. It's gonna suck not being able to see my niece as much as I wanted for the next possible few years but compared to never being able to see her at all (like Jack's mom) it is what it is.

We told her that the payments and car insurance were her responsibility, but she was over the moon. We were leasing the car before she took it over, and she wanted to change it to where she owns the car when it pays off. We explained to her that she wasn’t allowed to change her mind later if she didn’t want it anymore, but she was adamant that she loved this car and wanted to keep it. So we went to the dealership and got all the paperwork in order, with both of our names on the car. 
 
Now that a few years have passed and she’s moved out, she’s been complaining that the car is too expensive and she’s struggling to afford to keep it. She suggested that she sell it, as the car is in good condition and she would probably get more than she owed, with some leftover to still get a cheaper car. 
 
We explained to her that this was not a possibility. My husband's business has been struggling lately, and talks of layoffs have been discussed.

We told her we could take it back and assume the rest of the payments, but that answer wasn’t good enough for her.

6,1d6tta1,AITA for backing out of my friend’s wedding?,"My friend (32m) had vented to me numerous times about his fiancé (32f) to the point where he admitted he wasn’t happy and was on the fence about calling off the wedding. I (30m) have only known my friend for two years and has done nothing but vent about work, wedding planning and his relationship. Frankly, I feel as if there’s no other connection past that and I am his only friend in the city. 

I was affected by my parents’ imperfect relationship, so now I have this thing where I stand on healthy relationships leading up to marriage. My friend would go on rants about trivial instances in the relationship, which all circles back to his fiancé’s lack of communication skills. 

Now, he’s begging his fiance to attend couple’s counseling before marriage only to be pushed back and told that they shouldn’t be married if there’s anything wrong with the relationship. It’s a tough position to be in.

As a result, he’s recently reached a tipping point crying for help telling me that he will cancel the wedding if his fiancé doesn’t succumb to his wishes——I suggested serving an ultimatum. I ultimately lost respect when he uttered “maybe she’ll die shortly after I put a ring on it so I can start all over” in a fit of rage. 

He is still going to follow through because the money has already been spent halfway through the budget and he doesn’t want to be judged for calling off the wedding.

I personally think that he will end up in an unhappy marriage and going through formalities won’t solve anything, so I decided against supporting their relationship knowing what I know. 

I know he needed a friend more than anything, but knowing too much just wouldn’t sit well with me on their day.

My (40F) husband (42M Jack) invited our niece (22F Holly), his sister’s daughter, to stay with us for a month. She was laid off and her mom was pressuring her to find work. He wanted to give her space to “decompress and think about next steps.” I love Holly, she’s wonderful. I’m happy to host her and am excited to see her. I took issue with Jack extending the invitation without looping me in first, he informed me after the fact. 

Some background. I’m the primary caregiver for my parents & grandma since 10/2021. They are disabled, don’t drive or cook. My mom has had a slew of medical issues with ~15 hospitalizations in the past 3 years plus ER visits I’ve lost count of. Two of her admissions she was in ICU on a vent and almost died - it’s been stressful. I’m at the hospital daily when she’s there and am her advocate. I’m her only child and all responsibility is on me; I’ve been severely burnt out for the past year juggling their needs and working a full time job. Jack is aware of my burnout. We started IVF in January, which adds another layer of stress. Jack works from home. He’s required in the office 3 weeks a year for scheduled events. 1 of those weeks was Holly’s 1st week here, which meant me stepping up to do the majority of work as hostess, cooking, etc. on top of caregiving tasks and IVF appts. Holly’s worth it. But given the stress in our life rn, I wanted to opt-in by my own choice versus being voluntold by Jack. 

When he told me she was coming I expressed only excitement. After her being here 2 weeks I spoke with him because he was checked-out about her visit and not communicating. For ex., her 1st week here he had to work late three nights due to events he knew in advance. I found out he wouldn’t be home until 10 pm when I text him at 4 asking what time I should have dinner ready. The 2nd week he was supposed to work from home. I found out at dinner Sun. night (because I asked a question about planning not because he told me) that his schedule changed and he was driving into the office the entire week. That night I expressed frustration at his lack of involvement in her stay. In the middle of the argument I said something like, “You invited her without giving me any say, the least you could do is communicate proactively, or book some tickets for the things she wants to do. I’ve made all the plans, purchased all the tickets, and made all her meals.” He said, “You want me to ask permission for someone to come to my house?” I said it wasn’t about asking permission, it was about communicating with his wife. He said, “We have a real problem if I have to ask you permission for someone to visit me in my house.” I repeated it wasn’t about permission, it was about treating his spouse as an equal and a partner. We’ve not yet resolved the conversation because we won’t argue in front of Holly (none of this is her fault and I don’t want her to think we are arguing because of her). 

ETA: Wow! I woke up to so many comments! Thank you all for taking time to read this and comment. I will read all of them but it may take me a bit. Some quick info based on the ones I’ve read so far:

- Holly is 22 but is young for her age. I don’t know if this matters or not but she isn’t from the U.S. and grew up in a country where it isn’t safe for her to go out and explore on her own (my in-laws’ words not mine). Because of that she isn’t very independent/confident, she just got her license and a car 1-2 years ago. I hadn’t considered letting her go explore on her own here but it doesn’t mean it isn’t feasible, that decision I’d probably leave in her and Jack’s hands. Also when I said to my husband, “I’ve cooked all her meals” what I meant (and he knew this) was dinner, I see how that’s not clear how I wrote it. She has been cooking for herself and cleaning after herself during the day (breakfast & lunch). My parents have specific dietary needs and I have to make them dinner anyway so I didn’t ask her to cook. She did offer to help with prep several nights and I took her up on that when she offered. She did make me lunch two days. 

- People were asking how much Jack normally helps around the house. We pay for cleaning service in our home twice a month and lawn service for our yard twice a month because we don’t have the time. Normally he and I split making dinner, 3 nights each and one night we get take out. He used to be fine with this but has gotten increasingly annoyed/grumpy about it over the past 1-2 years because my dad is a finicky eater, and I suspect he is also feeling burn out. I drive my family to 90% of their appointments but if I have a work conflict he will move things around to take them and does not complain about that. He handles all things grooming & vet for our dogs, we split pet feedings and potty breaks between us. He does his own laundry & ironing but defaults things like sheets and kitchen towels to me. He washes the dishes after dinner every night even if I tell him to let me do them sometimes. I make sure 90% of the bills get paid and handle the groceries. There has always been a selfish streak in him that flares over certain things but he can also be very thoughtful and considerate, especially with gift giving or planning dates/celebrations like birthdays. That has also taken a significant hit since my mom fell ill. He is not an incel tho he might sound like it in my post. 

- IVF, I will read all of these comments and consider them deeply. Will also share the sentiments with him and see how he feels & what he thinks. We don’t take the responsibility of becoming parents lightly. It is also something we’ve both always wanted, even with the added stress and chaos that littles bring. Perhaps because of my own upbringing it doesn’t feel insurmountable to caregive and be a mom. My mom and I moved in with my grandparents after she and my bio father divorced, he was abusive and totally absent from my upbringing. (The man I refer to as my dad is my stepdad). My grandfather was disabled on one side from a stroke and my grandmother caregave for him and also helped her mother-in-law, a great aunt, and an older 3rd cousin with no children with their groceries, errands, driving, etc. Difference being she was retired and all those women lived in different homes. I understand the unequal partners and disrespect red flags, which was why I posted here to see if my feelings were valid, and I will spend time reflecting on all of this before we start or postpone our next cycle.

8,1d6tp5s,WIBTA if I stop helping my ex coworker who is a single mother?,"My coworker was only at my work for less than two week. She was either terminated or quit, depending on who you ask. On her first day of work, she came to me begging for 20$. I don’t remember what she needed it for. She I gave her 40$ to help her out. After that point, she would come to me once and a while asking for more money. 
After work one day, I bought her over $150 of stuff including school supplies and a few dvds. When we were checking out, she asked for money on top of what I was getting her. She said it in a joking kind of way, but it still upset me. After she left out work place, she has reached out 3 times for help over the last month and a half. First she needed some money for her water bill, so I gave her 60$ to be nice. Then I was her light bill. And today she was asking for help with groceries for her and her kids. 
As much as want to keep helping her, it seems like she keeps guilting me into giving her more money. I am struggling to pay my mortgage and bills as well as the 25k I owe on my credit card. We are a single income family with my spouse who is unable to work because of disability issues. I feel guilty because she is a single mom but I feel like she is taking advantage of my kindness. So, would I be the asshole if I stopped helping her? 

Edit: the only reason I am conflicted is that it’s “they are about to turn my ___ off”  and “I can buy milk, do you have some a could have?” 
It’s like little stuff that I can easily help her with. But I am having trouble saying no when her two kids (middle school age) are being affected as well. 

UPDATE: Turns out you guys were right. I don’t know why I didn’t ask questions sooner. I decided to ask my coworkers if she asked them for money as well. Turns out she did ask everyone for money and I am the dumb one who said yes. She has a bf or husband to help her. She has been taking advantage of me after all. 
Unfortunately, I am a dumbass so I am meeting with her soon. I am going to give her the gallon of milk she asked for and ask her to not contact me again.

9,1d6t5ub,AITA for  trying to play my way through a local card game tournament?,"Today I entered a small local tournament for a card game, something like Magic or Yugioh. One of the participants is my roommate and the  judge (RJ for the sake of brevity). I know he doesn't like to play competitively and prefers causal play, so I tend to avoid playing with him since I usually play with a more competitive mindset, I try to make sure I am doing as well as I can in competitive scenarios. I feel people can play how they want as long as they don't intentionally hurt or disrespect others, and that that should apply to myself as well. However, RJ was in the tourny for today.



I couldn't avoid getting paired up against him in the second round. We went to our third game since he beat me in our second game and I even tried to compliment how he got me with an unexpected tactic. Then eventually he asks me a question about how a certain mechanic works. I misunderstood the question since it didn't fully make sense to me without context. I tried my best to answer, and then he made his play and I see what the context of his question was. I try to, as non-confrontationally as possible, point out how the play doesn't work according to the way the rules work in this scenario.



This results in RJ tearing into me for about 15 minutes. Now, objectively, he points out some issues about me that I had been unaware were problems, as I tend to get inside my own head about things and not realize if they don't come across the way I intend. There was a previous event that I did poorly in the first round, and he says he should have banned me from the store for poor sportsmanship since I left abruptly and according to him people complained about that. I was simply too frustrated with myself to keep playing so I removed myself from the scenario so I didn't say or do anything offensive. 



Another issue he pointed out was that I complain when I don't get good pulls from packs or when others get good pulls. I am used to people joking around like this when it comes to such things, so thought that was how people acted about such occurrences. I will be more mindful of this in the future. 



Primarily he complains that I play too seriously and that it has driven others from playing the game or ruined it for them. I can't say if this is true or not as he is the only one that has told me about this, but I have not heard from said people that it isn't true. 



So I simply just take what was said and reflect on it and don't react so as not to cause further issues. I play my next round as non-verbally as possible. RJ played for first place that third round, but lost to his opponent, but he did not go on any tired at that point. After the event, at least one player told me that as far as he knew he didn't know what RJ was on about, but that was the only feedback I'd heard.

I’ve been dealing with a lot of academic stress due to the one course.  It was pretty bad to a point that it triggered my anxiety and by anxiety i mean panick attacks, stressing, crying, hating life, overall just a bad case of anxiety.

T’s family doesn’t have a lot of money and A’s family is pretty wealthy, as is mine, and my parents said probably not, because they think it’s unfair to not take T when T wouldn’t be able to go without us. If my parents would have asked me a year ago it wouldn’t have mattered to me and I would have taken T over A (even though I love them equally) because A would have been able to go anyways and T wouldn’t have.

Some context: Me (18F) and my best friend Jen (18F) have been friend for around 10 years now and we are essentially more like sisters. The issue started when she started dating Eli (18M) around 7 months ago.

I’ve noticed since Eli and Jen started dating she has become an awful friend. We used to see each other nearly everyday for hours and would tell each other everything about our lives. Now we hangout once a week and half the time we do, Eli is there. Normally I would not have a problem with this as I have many other friends who bring their bfs to our hangouts and we have a great time. The issue is he is an awful person. He treats Jen awfully and she doesn’t even realise it, he is extremely rude to me for no reason but then will also flirt with me when she is not in the room, he will tell both me and her not to do certain things but will then go and do the same with his friends, and is just not a pleasant person to be around. 

Recently I have noticed Jen has become distant and rude to me all the time. We would regularly go out drinking together almost every weekend but now she spends every day with Eli. She also has to make everything into a competition. Something is stressing me out? well she happens to be struggling with it more. We are also banned from talking about certain life events because it ‘stresses her out too much’ even though she literally has had almost everything handed to her in life. Whenever we hangout she doesn’t even pay attention to half the things i say or will interrupt me constantly to the point where i get so overwhelmed and go mute (i have autism).

20,1d6r674,AITA for applying for a long shot dream job without telling my wife?,"I (50M) married my wife (57F) and we raised 3 children to adulthood and have six grandchildren. We're happy and spend nearly all of our time together. It's a very pleasant life but an old flame that never quite went out intruded into it about a month ago. I read in an engineering trade rag that NASA was recruiting for a year long mission in a simulated Mars base. Mars might be simulated but the mission is real and it pays and includes room and board. So it would be fun for me and would pay the bills. When I checked it out online, I saw that NASA was recruiting real astronauts, too.

My wife knows that I had always wanted to be an astronaut and, as ridiculous as this sounds, I’m actually fairly qualified. I had tried to apply twenty-five years ago but my eyesight made it a non-starter. So I chose a different career path it's been fun and exciting and, despite having no formal training, my wife has been a big part of it while also running her own real estate investments which I help her on.

Now, NASA has relaxed the astronaut eyesight requirement and also changed the age range. And I was made more qualified by the skills that I picked up working on my wife's construction projects and fixing her heavy equipment. So I applied, putting those skills front and center. I never intended this to remain secret; I simply intended to ask her what she thought as soon as I heard anything from NASA which I expected to never happen.

But my wife saw me on my computer and asked me what I was doing so of course I told her. I thought that she'd find it amusing or at least benign but instead she hit the roof. Her objections were all reasonable. She wouldn’t relocate to Houston; being gone for a year wasn't the point of being married; we had children and grandchildren who needed me here; and it’s dangerous. Of course I stopped applying for the astronaut corps immediately and told her about the (actually more selective) simulated Mars mission that I had already applied for. I told her that I had never intended to continue without discussing it with her if I were miraculously contacted by NASA.

She was furious with me for having applied in the first place and wouldn't talk to me for two days! When NASA contacted me a few weeks later with some medical questions, I withdrew my application. But it remains a sore point with us and I really want to understand: should I have asked her opinion at such an early stage in such an improbable process? She thinks so and I am worried that I may be the asshole.

21,1d7jg19,AITA for not helping a hungry friend?,"Throwaway because my friends know my Reddit account.

I (13F) have a good friend I'll call June (13F). She has autism, which makes her picky about the foods she eats, and even when her parents pack her food, she never ends up eating it, only her snacks. This always results in her being hungry. She frequently ends up going out for lunch to buy food, as her parents are financially well-off. Normally, she either goes alone, or I come with her.

As I try to restrict the amount of time I go across the street, there's been two times this week (Monday and Tuesday) where I told her I didn't want to go. This is only because I've gotten in trouble with my parents for unrelated reasons, and they told me I wasn't allowed to go, which I've told her. However, I have broken the rules before, and I think she expected me to do it again, which I haven't been doing for quite a bit of time now. I also have very low self-restraint, as she knows, and I spend almost every time we go across the street, which is something I am trying to work on. One of the reasons I didn't go was because of that fact, and she knows this too.

As I said, I told her I didn't wanna go. She accepted this. On Monday she just laid on the couch we have in class and rested for a bit. On Tuesday, she went out on her own, but came back unhappy (she got catcalled, which happens frequently when she goes out on her own. This doesn't happen often, which is why I assumed she would just stay back again.) I often offer her my own snacks, or try to persuade my other friends to go with her, but they don't budge either.

On Wednesday, we were going on a field trip and she told me that she was mad at me these past two days. I was confused as she's never mentioned it beforehand. But she told me that I was ""Putting my own wants over a starving friend"".

We are a great little family, but mom and I keep on getting in tiffs for things like this.  Dad is not the most emotionally supportive so she makes every effort to dote on him.  I for the most part understand that.  Sometimes I come home from work and he is on my side of the bed chilling, snacking, dropping crumbs. It can irk me.  

Mom will not allow a tv in his room and I feel the same way.  She doesn't want him stuck up stairs watching tv all day.  I feel that applies for our bedroom as well.  He has a whole loft area up-stairs with a couch and a recently new to us giant tv.  In addition, next to our bedroom, downstairs, we have a family room with another large tv and couch.  I simply point out, hey we should not come home from school and plop down in our bed, on my side, watching tv, when we have areas set aside for that.  I have expressed this multiple times but get told I am too controlling and kill the vibe when I get home.  To clarify, mom was out in the garden while he was chilling on my side of the bed.   Again every now and then is ok, I have no problem with that, especially when it is kind of weekend thing.  I literally asked him when I got home, seeing him there, why he did not use the other areas provided for that?  Mom came in hot and escalated the situation and it was not a good look for either of us due to a previous tiff.  

I know some of our tiffs stem from other things and this is just a coal in the fire sometimes, but I don't think it is that big of an ask.  I do feel that children should not be in our bedroom and have made changes in my beliefs regarding that.  We have a giant house and we should be allowed to have an adults only area.  So him always in there is a hard swallow, but I do so for her.  Again I enjoy the kid very much and we have a great relationship.  I have been in his life for nearly six years now.

I simply point out, hey we should not come home from school and plop down in our bed, on my side, watching tv, when we have areas set aside for that.  I have expressed this multiple times but get told I am too controlling and kill the vibe when I get home.  To clarify, mom was out in the garden while he was chilling on my side of the bed.   Again every now and then is ok, I have no problem with that, especially when it is kind of weekend thing.  I literally asked him when I got home, seeing him there, why he did not use the other areas provided for that?  Mom came in hot and escalated the situation and it was not a good look for either of us due to a previous tiff.  

I know some of our tiffs stem from other things and this is just a coal in the fire sometimes, but I don't think it is that big of an ask.  I do feel that children should not be in our bedroom and have made changes in my beliefs regarding that.  We have a giant house and we should be allowed to have an adults only area.  So him always in there is a hard swallow, but I do so for her.  Again I enjoy the kid very much and we have a great relationship.  I have been in his life for nearly six years now.  I just feel I should not be challenged about when I bring it up on occasion that maybe we should use other areas set aside for things no matter how much the chill is better in our room.

24,1d7ioxk,AITA for only staying at my parents’ place while visiting my hometown?   ,"I (30F) have been married to my partner (33M) for over 4 years. Long story short, my family as well as I have been social people in general with social etiquettes like calling and checking up on people regularly, informing regarding change in plans to other people, thanking for gifts received, staying in touch with friends and family, etc. My partner’s family is the opposite. In these 4 years, his parents have never called me once, it is always me who calls them. I’m at a point where this relationship seems very one-sided to me. My parents are also the ones who call them to stay in touch. In-laws don’t ever call my parents either. 

Things were going as there were for 4 years but I recently got pregnant and delivered a healthy baby. My in-laws didn’t check up on me once during the entire pregnancy. Not even once. In my culture it is common for MILs to stay with us to care for the DIL postpartum along with the baby. MIL didn’t bother planning to come and when my mother was coordinating her own visit, MIL talked extremely rudely by not giving adequate answers. I stopped calling eventually as the relation felt one sided and I felt only I was maintaining it. To top it off, MIL complained about me not calling her enough (even though she NEVER calls me) to my mother and aunt when they had visited them to invite for a wedding in our family. It resulted in my mother crying and feeling extremely hurt. 

Now that I have delivered, she wants me to send pictures of the baby to her while she makes no effort to keep the relationship with me ongoing. My partner and I plan to visit our hometown soon and we were discussing the number of days we’ll need to stay at his place together since his parents haven’t spent time with the baby. He plans to stay there for a month and me for 5 months. I told him I’ll stay at in-laws’ place while he’s there but I don’t feel like staying there for the next 4 months as I am hurt they behaved badly with my mother and want nothing to do with me, making me feel like they don’t care for me at all.

My mom tried to talk to me after and apologized for getting frustrated and being aggressive with my daughter, but I wasn’t having it. I went back inside the venue and told my brother about what had happened and that we were leaving and that I was sorry for leaving early. He seemed understanding and upset with my mom and I gave him and his new bride hugs and we left! I talked to my brother and his new wife the next day about it all and apologized again for leaving early and they were fine with it and said they understood and we even made plans for the following Saturday to get together again. I haven’t spoken to my mother since the wedding. However today my brother calls me while I’m at work and now says he’s upset about us leaving. He feels unsupported because we missed the dances and send off. I told him that I was sorry again and that he’s valid to be upset. I also reached out and apologized to his wife again. I just want to know AITA for leaving? ",0.0,0.05865023657679558,0,1
32,1d7h20m,AITA for keeping the “group chat” private?,"I (26M) and my wife (27F) recently had an argument about me and friend’s mysterious “group chat” and how we interact, or rather why I keep that “secret”.

A few nights ago my wife and I were hanging out in bed and settling down for the night when she mentioned her family group text and sending memes among her siblings and how she wants to add me to it which I was honored by. I then jokingly mentioned that would be a funny transition going from my group chat “with the boys” from my time in the National Guard (the only mass text I really engage in) to her family over Facebook messenger, not really thinking anything of it. She pressed me a bit on it as to why it would be weird/funny to which I tried to move on from the point and just say it’s a very different social dynamic and that we’re all stupid and brainrotted. 

At this point it was pretty clear she was now very curious about what goes on in that dumpster fire and was weirdly taking it very seriously. She went as far as to say, “you can talk to me about anything” as if I was trying to hide some deep emotional thing. I just told her it “it’s not the kind of stuff you’d find funny or interesting” hoping the conversation would move on from there but she just kept pressing for more information. 

What follows isn’t verbatim but the general gist of the conversation:

W: “but I’m interested now, what kind of stuff?”

Op: “it’s all inside jokes and bits that are way too   hard to explain without all the foreknowledge”

W: “I’m not dumb, I could figure it out, let me see”

(At this point I knew I was done for)

Op: “I’m not saying you’re dumb, it’s just not the kind of stuff you talk about with your loved ones, it’s all dumb esoteric goboldigook. You had to be there sort of stuff”

And this went on and on for a little while until she started acting like I was cheating on her or something so I caved and showed her the most recent meme, a bad photoshop my buddy did of Adolf Hitler and Yakub kissing on a beach, to make a point. 

She seemed relieved I wasn’t keeping nasty secrets but was upset that she was excluded from a part of my life. I tried stressing that she wasn’t at all and that my discord group is not real life and that we had just went to my friend’s (the one who did the photoshop) wedding 6 months prior. That was the end of the argument and we went to bed but she still seemed sad in a way that she was excluded. In the end it really wasn’t a big deal but I feel her reaction was silly considering she had even sent me a meme about “the group chat” getting busted a few weeks prior. 

Am I the asshole for compartmentalizing my social life? 

Edit::: To make it more clear, the reason I had brought it up at all was because she had shown me a meme of “when they find the group chat” and it’s a video of bunch of people walking out in handcuffs and thought it was funny. So I just made a little quip about it. 

At the heart of it tho, some of that stuff is pretty racy and I’d rather not have my loved ones see it out of years of context and take it literally.

When she was 16, my friend started experiencing anxiety and depression that gradually got worse. It wasn’t until she was in our twenties that she confessed she had been abused as a child which was likely the cause of her mental health struggles. Throughout all this, I’ve been trying to be as a supportive as I can by talking through how her therapy sessions go every week, listening to talk about anything she needs, going to doctors appointments with her etc. 

I’ve not experienced mental health struggles nor any abuse (thankfully) so I know I can’t ever truly understand her pain but I’ve tried to be there for her as much as I possibly can. 

Recently, she has been dissociating from everyone and now only really talks to me and her therapist. Every time, I've talked to her in the past couple of months the conversation has remained on her due to her mental health taking a significant dip.

She’s been talking about dropping out of her studies and I been advising her not to. She's worked so hard and she's nearly done. Last time I talked to her about this, she snapped at me and shouted this is what she ‘hates about me’ and that ‘I can’t understand what it’s like for her’.

35,1d7gpl8,AITAH - Did I handle school run appropriately?? ,"Right so, I'm not one for a long post so ill summarise where I can! 

It was my 30(m) turn for school run this morning, due to logistics, we drove the 600m up the road to the school (We was very late.. shoes) 

Already stressed, I somehow find an empty carpark space out the front,  I get the kids out - in school, I come back to my car to find someone else has parked in front of my car directly blocking me in.. I literally had 25 minutes to get to an appointment I've been waiting months for.. 

Honestly, I know who's car it is, she had a newborn and seems to smash the school.run solo consistently, so props to her.. never ever spoke to her! Only time I've heard of her was starting a physical fight with another mum in the playground a year ago.. no other context. 

At first, I waited, but 2-5 minutes turned to 15. Everyone else had left the carpark. 
I got out looked around, nobody. 
Walked over to the car to see of I could push it but noticed everything unlocked and phone/cash/etc inside.. no baby. 

I thought, amusing to myself. Fuck it, jumped in, dropped the handbrake and rolled 25 metres back to a side space.. jumped back in my car and left. 

I laughed the entire time, thought I was a genius... 

When I got home though, the wife said that wasn't a normal reaction, that this bird is going to be pissed when she walks out and her cars not where she left it.. I thought, well minor. Its 25metres, not 25km. She inconsideratly blocked me, but apparently not.

36,1d7gn2k,AITA for requesting more work hours?,"For a little back round I (18F) have been working a retail job for about 7 months now. Out of all seven months I have never no called no show and come in when someone else calls out if they need me. I would consider myself a pretty good worker and even have a good relationship with my coworkers. All except for my boss. We recently went through a management change and our old boss moved back to his hometown to work in the chain over there. Which caused us to get a new boss, one of the lead managers, we will call her Annie. Everyone was excited that Annie got the position because we all hoped she would be a better boss than the last. But oh boy were we wrong. Annie messes up the schedule every week and never gives days off that we need, she takes off the days everyone requests just so they can not have it. Which is not at all why they pay her. The big boss that is over her has warned her multiple times that she can not take time off every week because they pay her 2x what we associates make. But she does not care and still takes time off because “If they wanted to fire her they already would have”. Now down to the problem at hand. As I mentioned, I’m 18 so I just graduated high school. But three weeks ago before graduation I scheduled 4 days off 2 days because I had graduation practice during my usual work hours, one day for graduation and another for my graduation party. She straight out, told me that I could only have one of the days and that would be the day of one of the graduation practices, but the other three days I would have to come in. I told her that I would not be missing my own graduation to come to work for 44 lousy dollars which is before they take half for taxes. She told me to come in or I would be fired, then she left 3 hours before she was supposed to. I was so upset so I told one of the other managers who is my friend, and she went and talked to the big boss friend who has worked in the store for over 20 years. We will call her Lisa. The next day apparently Lisa took Annie to the office and yelled at her about trying to take away my graduation because she is upset she never graduated and ended up being 37 working in retail while I am actually trying to make something of myself. Gold Bless Lisa wherever she is! The big boss then gave her a strike for trying to drive away the only people who could put up with the stores work life. But it’s been two weeks since I’ve graduated and I’ve worked a total of 8 hours and at first I thought everyone was working lower hours until I checked the community schedule and noticed I am the only one working less that 4 days a week. I asked her if I could get at least 3-4 days a week and she yelled at me for not putting in enough effort to want to come to work but I in fact not only come on all days scheduled that I didn’t request off but I come at least 10 mins early to let the other person go count their till.

38,1d7fq0e,AITA for discontinuing my financial support to my elderly mother?,"6 months ago I started contributing 150 C$ every month to my mom. She has a 2000 C$ pension and lives in a paid off condo, but has a hard time making ends meet. She is taking from her savings every month to cover deficits. She claims she lives frugally, but to me it seems she does not want to change her lifestyle. She needs more expensive skin care products, as she has had cancer treatment and now has sensitive skin. She also likes to shop at the health food store across the street, and the convenience store two streets down. Which I get, because it is convenient. My brother also contributes the same amount every month. We both are in our 40's, and have families. I am single, and am supporting two daughters, one in university. 

I borrowed my mom's car the last month, and scratched a hubcap. I ordered a new one the same day, but the next morning my mom sent me a text going on about it - she had first said it did not matter - and saying that it would cost at least 100 C$ to replace it, etc. She sent that same message to her ex-husband, my father, and to my brother, and probably to others as well. This really bothered me. My father had sent her money to treat me for my birthday, I found out from him later. But she happily accepted when I offered to pay for our meal together, because I wanted to treat her (I did not know about the gift from my dad). 

When my parents divorced, my mom got a condo. She had two relationships after, and inherited more than 200000 C$ from these men in total. There is not much left of it, maybe only 50000 C$. I am 15 years away from my own retirement, and have no retirement savings, apart from the house I own. My car needs a lot of work soon. 

My mother can be selfish and lash out when things don't go her way. She often calls me names when she gets upset, or makes me feel guilty about things, like moving away, not calling enough, etc. My daughters don't like their grandmother at all, which saddens me, because they both have seen her misbehave, towards me, or in the case of my oldest daughter, towards her own granddaughter. 

I stopped the 150 C$ payment this month, and told my mom today. She has been going on about it all day, sending me text after text. I started giving her the money to stop her complaining about money all the time. But I fear it will start again now. And now she has gotten used to the contribution, starting to expect it. 

AITA for first giving her money, and then after 6 months saying that I can't anymore? TBH, if I really wanted to, I could find the money and give it to her.

But she happily accepted when I offered to pay for our meal together, because I wanted to treat her (I did not know about the gift from my dad). 

When my parents divorced, my mom got a condo. She had two relationships after, and inherited more than 200000 C$ from these men in total. There is not much left of it, maybe only 50000 C$. I am 15 years away from my own retirement, and have no retirement savings, apart from the house I own. My car needs a lot of work soon. 

My mother can be selfish and lash out when things don't go her way. She often calls me names when she gets upset, or makes me feel guilty about things, like moving away, not calling enough, etc. My daughters don't like their grandmother at all, which saddens me, because they both have seen her misbehave, towards me, or in the case of my oldest daughter, towards her own granddaughter. 

I stopped the 150 C$ payment this month, and told my mom today. She has been going on about it all day, sending me text after text. I started giving her the money to stop her complaining about money all the time. But I fear it will start again now. And now she has gotten used to the contribution, starting to expect it. 

AITA for first giving her money, and then after 6 months saying that I can't anymore? TBH, if I really wanted to, I could find the money and give it to her. I just don't like it anymore, as I can not help feeling used. Help me see this clearly :)",0.0,0.006273807026445866,0,1

42,1d7el8w,AITA for trying to set a boundary with my parents and telling my 16yo sister she’s responsible for printing her own work?,"We have an old printer that‘s been printing weird. Changing the ink solves the issue sometimes, but not always. My dad changed the ink for it and left for work telling my sister (16) to try printing a couple of pages to see if it works well.

Before my sis came downstairs, my mom kept calling her to come down to try printing. I told my sis to go because mom’s calling her, but she didn’t budge even after hearing my mom call 3+ times until my little brother comes upstairs. He tells her “I told you mom said for you to come down”, for which she replies “I didn’t hear you”, her go-to excuse. She hears, and I even tell her too, but she doesn’t go until my mom gets angry. 

Anyway, she printed the papers to test the printer and it didn’t work well. When my dad came home from work, he asks me about the other printer we have (no one never used) and what its missing. I tell him I don’t know, he was the one who bought it. He tells me to see if it needs ink and if so, I need to add some.

I tell him I don’t know anything about that printer, and then he tells me “there isn’t such a thing as something you don’t know, use YouTube”, then he leaves. I start to get frustrated because it’s not my responsibility to print my sister’s papers. I’m trying to make things for my small business, so I just walk away from the stairs and tell him again — I don’t know. 

When I go downstairs to help prep for lunch, mom tells me that we need to try printing more with the old printer. I then respond and say “ok, tell her to try”. By “her” I’m referring to my 16yo sis. My mom tells me to not talk back to her and I tell her that my sis should just test at the library because they have a better printer and she’s actually in a testing environment. My mom then scolds me telling me I wouldn’t reply like that if it was my dad and then I told her I did reply like “that” to him earlier.

When we sit down to eat lunch, my two sis (16 and 14) both “team up” on me, something they do, and tell me I need to be less selfish and not talk back to mom. I then tell my 16yo sis, the one that needs her own papers printed, that she’s printed many for herself —way more than me — and it’s her responsibility to print her own stuff because I have my own responsibilities.

She then calls me selfish, so I tell her that she’s the one being selfish/lazy because she wants other people to do things for her. I then brought up an example for when she left her jacket on the ground for a while and didn’t hang her jacket on the hanger. And when I told her to hang it, she called me lazy for not hanging HER jacket. Again, I tell her it’s not my responsibility and she doesn’t seem to understand that. My other sis (14) keeps unnecessarily interrupting me while I’m trying to say this and keeps telling me to stop talking when I’m trying to communicate.

43,1d7eizy,AITA for blowing up at my bf for not meeting my family?  ,"i (18f) went over to my boyfriend (17m) house to meet his family. For context; Friday we graduated from high school and we both had graduation parties on the same day that ended up overlapping with each other. We both had family from out of town coming to support us. His was within driving distance while my relatives had to fly out to come and see me, so they were staying with us. 

  I asked if I could go over to my boyfriend's, let's call him Shawn, house for an hour so I could meet his family (whoever was still there.) I met his uncle, his two cousins and his older brother. I stayed for an hour and played games with them, and he drove me home.  

Here's where the problem lies. He didn't come into the house, not even to say a quick hello to my relatives. My dad even said ""oh come in!"" but Shawn said ""nah I'm just dropping her off"" and left. My aunts and cousins were in the dining room, it's not like it would've taken a long time for him to just say hi and introduce himself to them. Especially since they don't live as close as his family does, and my aunts are on the older side.  I should also mention that we are black, and my boyfriend is white. My aunt asked, half jokingly, if he didn't want to meet us. I laughed at it but I was really annoyed. He's the farthest thing from racist, but how does it look when the white boy doesn't even step foot into the house full of black people? 

 After my family went to bed I blew up at my boyfriend for not coming in for like 2 seconds to say hi to my family, especially after I spent time with his. He was anxious to get home because his brother was staying with them and he lives in Maine. Shawn is really close to his brother, something I don't quite relate to since I have no siblings. He said that it wasn't his fault, that his family had board games set up at home (they hadn't when I left) and that he had to get back. I pointed out that it wouldn't have been a huge deal if he just stopped and stepped in for less than a minute just to say freaking hi to my family, who wanted to met him. He said he had people waiting on him, that his brother doesn't come down that often, and that he wanted to meet them ""when he had time to say more than just hi."" I reminded him that my family lives in a different time zone, for gods sake, and that the next time he would be able to meet them would probably be my college graduation, to which he said ""oh I forgot about Wisconsin."" I basically told him that what he did was probably the worst thing he could've done in this situation and he sort of just brushed it off.

47,1d7e4cn,AITA - People not knowing the meaning of words!,"AITA - this is my first ever post by the way. 

So recently I was having a conversation with a friend, talking about drugs and how people have this cognitive dissonance thing where the word nicotine isn’t associated with the term ‘drug’, whereas things like cocaine immediately bring that word (drug) into our mind. They thought that it was obvious why the term nicotine wasn’t commonly thought of as a drug, whilst I argued that it’s important to remember what we are talking about, especially as this will help people better understand what they’re doing to their bodies.

After a while, and some disagreement, they called me a puritan, which I immediately said was ridiculous and nothing to do with our conversation.

I had taken the word puritan to mean someone who believes in self control and the minimisation of life’s pleasures (which, as it happens, is reasonably close to what the dictionary says).

Either way, they thought that it meant someone who takes things too literally, which is very far from the true definition, and proceeded to accuse me of deliberately ignoring context and suggested that I should have ‘known them better’ and that I should have figured out what they meant.

As it turns out, I consider myself relatively well read and I tried to explain that when a niche word like that is used, my brain immediately jumps to the definition that I know of, especially since people who use words like that tend to use them correctly (at least in my experience).

In the end, they said that the issue was my fault, that I was difficult to talk too, and that they now feel as though they can’t have a conversation with me. We left it there.

48,1d7e0jy,AITA for touching my sisters stuff after asking her to stop touching my stuff?,"So just to preface, I live with my mother still, and my older sister as well who is 20 years old. My sister has a habit of touching my stuff without asking, I.E. using my towel to clean stuff up, eating food I ask her not to eat, etc. She also has a habit of fussing at me if I so much as put laundry in her room when swapping the wash. 

She recently has gotten really into wanting a PC setup, and asked to use mine to play sims (she has a laptop that runs all her mods just fine already) and got very upset when I said no. For context, my storage is limited because it's a hand-me-down from my brother and he has a lot of old stuff taking up space on there already tjat he hasn't removed yet (he lives across the country). I told her to get a moniter, mouse, and keyboard if she wanted to do that, since she can hook it up to her laptop. She did that and currently has everything except for a chair. 

Yesterday she took my chair without asking and when I confronted her she said ""I didn't ask because I knew you would say no."" This irritated me because of the amount of times she has done things like this and occasionally even lost the things she takes from me (I know she can't lose the chair, but the principle of it is what matters, and its irritating that I've told her to stop so many times). So I went in her room to get my chair back, and once I did, I took the USB from her wireless mouse and hid it behind a small panda in a zen garden on her desk. I didn't damage it and I know where it is if she can't find it. I told my friends and they agreed that it was funny and harmless. However when I told my mother (whom also gets mad that my sister takes her things and doesn't give them back) and she told me that was wrong and unreasonable and that I'm being an asshole for no reason.

Now I'm genuinely confused if I actually am the asshole, because I think in retrospect it's a way smaller deal than all the other instances my sister has done. 

My sister isn't home from work yet and doesn't even know it happened, so am I the Asshole? Should I just put it back? I genuinely don't know.

We're a group of three friends from high school.

Anyways, all this to say that there have been instances where I felt wronged and bad feelings that I didn't discuss with him since I think it's a waste of time and that it'd bring down the mood. So here comes today, the other friend of the group called me and asked me how I felt about the other friend since he told me that he also doesn't like how sometimes said friend behaves and I agree with him and we start talking some shit, exaggerating what I feel but still saying what I tought. After rambling on for some good 40 minutes he decided to reveal that the other friend was there all along and of course he was pissed. On one hand, I was saying what I really tought but on the other, I was obviously exaggerating, as the other friend was kinda encouraging me to do that, saying things in a way that I never would face to face.

50,1d7dfi9,AITA for planning my wedding whilst my grandad is terminally ill?,"
Hi Reddit,
I'm in my early 20s and my fiancé and I are Christians who believe that it's our time to get married. We got engaged in April, and when we told my family, they seemed thrilled. My grandad, who has been like a father figure to me, was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 cancer earlier this year. His diagnosis has been devastating for our close-knit family.

About a month after our engagement, we found a venue and I lightly suggested in our family group chat that my parents and grandparents could help with the initial deposit, giving us £250 each, which we would pay back in a few months. My grandparents are well off and have supported my mum financially, e.g. giving her £80k recently to buy out her ex from a house and is currently buying the furniture and decor for her new one which she is moving into in the near future. 

To my surprise, my mum sent a message saying it's selfish to get married next summer while my grandad is dying, and that our focus should be on his survival.
She mentioned that when she told my grandad about the wedding, he cried (though he's been very emotional lately).
This message left me heartbroken because I adore my grandad and never intended to cause any pain.

Additionally, my mum has been gossiping about my fiancé and me, falsely suggesting that we're having sex (we're not, due to our faith) and spreading misinformation about the cost of our wedding. She claims it's going to be an extravagant £16,000 event with a fancy car, even though we told her the venue, food, and drinks total £5000 for 100 people and we're budgeting for everything else. We've since paid the deposit ourselves and are taking on extra jobs to finance the rest.

I'm devastated about my grandad's condition and cherish every moment with him. I don't want to put my life on hold, but I also don't want to cause him or my family any more pain. I deeply admire my grandparents' marriage, which has been a beautiful example of love and resilience.
I feel that my own marriage would uphold
this legacy and honor the values they have embodied throughout their lives. I'm going back to my hometown in a few days and plan to discuss this with my mum in person.

So, Reddit, AlTA for wanting to get married next summer while my grandad is terminally ill?

Edit: I did not ask my grandparents directly for money, it was only in a group chat with my mum and dad. I get now this was a silly thing to do, and I wish I never did it.

Edit: my fiancé wrote a letter to my grandpa before this whole drama started (because he is isolating due to chemo as he had caught an infection and it was awful.) And my grandpa wrote us both back saying we absolutely have his blessing and how honoured he feels about the letter and how we are such a special couple in his eyes. I gave him the letter when I told him we were engaged. He has since changed his mind since speaking to my mum. 

Edit: For those asking, I did message my grandparents (they don’t like speaking on the phone) to explain that my mum may have communicated things inaccurately, and how much I care about my grandpa and love him, and how I will be spending as much time as possible with him. They responded that their lives have been completely flipped upside down since his diagnosis and that they have to take things one day at a time and can't think about the future. This wasn’t their original response, but I totally understand. It’s a terrible time for them. I do think what my mum has said has had an influence on their perspective. I haven’t been able to come back due to work, but I will be in a few days.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-03,"AITA for planning my wedding whilst my grandad is terminally ill?

52,1d7cnxh,AITAH for wanting my father to respect me?,"(IKIK, classic ragebait title, I just couldn't think of a better way to phrase it)

So just a few hours ago, me (M17) and my dad (M44 I think, I'm unsure of his age) got into an argument, after he quite literally told me to shut up in a rude way when I attempted to speak over his very loud tiktok videos he keeps watching at full volume, this isn't the first time he did this, it's a common occurence, but today was the day I finally had enough.

I was just talking about something I found interesting, trying to start some chatter while sitting in the living room, but the moment I opened my mouth he told me to shut up multiple times, once every time I spoke, so I stormed off so I wouldn't yell and cause a scene, since I know I can quickly lose control of my temper.

Unfortunately, I could still hear him talking bad about me, calling me silly and stupid (not his exact words, but we're not English and I don't know the exact translation) for just storming off, and I lost my temper.

I proceeded to start shouting, basically telling him that just because he is my father, does not mean he has the right to disrespect me.

My father taught me all my life to not respect those who do not respect me, but now this same rule is being applied to my father.

He replied by telling me that he, as my father, has every right to treat me however he wishes, and that if he says I'm silly, then it means I'm silly.

This resulted in me shouting for the next two minutes, repeatedly telling him over and over that he has no right to disrespect me when I was taught to respect him all my life, and I have respected him all of my life.

I know I'm not a very good son, my grades are not good, I'm not exactly in a stable place mentally, and he himself is facing some difficulties rn, but I just want him to treat me with some modicum of respect, and not be treated as if I'm some sort of doll for him to berate and insult at every opportunity.

He's always calling me lazy, entitled, silly, it feels as if my whole existence is just for him to ridicule.

Ik this seems like I'm just ragebaiting, and I can't blame you for just thinking this is ragebait, but I just feel like I have nowhere to speak this, my friends have their own problems, my sister will immediately tell my dad, and my mom is almost always absent due to work, so I just wanted somewhere to post this shitty situation I'm in.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-03,"AITAH for wanting my father to respect me?

53,1d7cngv,AITA for calling out a friend who is mentally ill but has done many bad things?,"I'm trying to keep this as short and simple as possible. I'll have to refer to people by initals to keep everyone anonymous- S (the friend mentioned in the title), J, L, B and C. . For context, B and C are both exes of S.

This all has been in the span of the last month. S on social media had been called out for heavily venting, sending art with graphic topics, making sexual jokes when asked not to, and hating on other users (for almost no reason) in a discord server created by J and L, when it was against the rules to do any of those things. S apologized for doing those things, but near the end of their apology they said that behavior was because of their depression and social anxiety. I was messaging them as they made the apology and they were telling me the whole time how they truly didn't feel sorry. J and L and the writer of the callout did not accept the apology but made a deal with S to not bring up the callout/apology again if S did the same.

Only a few weeks later, S brings up the callout/apology in multiple discord servers that had J and L in them, and starts saying incredibly hateful and threatening things about J, L, B, C, and much more people. Again, the whole time they are telling me that its fine because they are mentally ill and that this is their way of releasing those emotions, and that those people were rude to them before so the hate was justified.

Because of this, another user on the social media makes one final callout about S. This post was a revelation to me. At the absolute least (because I just checked the responses to the new callout), 9 people responded the post with their own stories about how they were treated poorly by S. Including the previously mentioned J, L, B, and C, with the latter two bringing up how toxic the relationships were and how in C's case S triggered lots of harmful behavior, and in B's case felt that their sexuality was being invalidated by S (B was aro, but felt forced to stay)

After that, S started to heavily vent and make threats on multiple of their accounts and vague-posted about me and everyone they knew. 

This is where I think I made a mistake/ actually became the asshole.  I made my own callout against S with my own proof and points. and behind the scenes I reached out to S to tell them to apologize and better themselves. But, the past few days they've been ghosting me- and anytime I reach out to anyone (C luckily responded), none of them respond.

At this point, everyone who is involved or knows about the situation sticks on one side and pushes heavily for it. I want everyone affected by S to be apologized to but also want S to be okay, even though the stuff they've done gets worse and worse the more that comes out.

S on social media had been called out for heavily venting, sending art with graphic topics, making sexual jokes when asked not to, and hating on other users (for almost no reason) in a discord server created by J and L, when it was against the rules to do any of those things. S apologized for doing those things, but near the end of their apology they said that behavior was because of their depression and social anxiety. I was messaging them as they made the apology and they were telling me the whole time how they truly didn't feel sorry. J and L and the writer of the callout did not accept the apology but made a deal with S to not bring up the callout/apology again if S did the same.

Only a few weeks later, S brings up the callout/apology in multiple discord servers that had J and L in them, and starts saying incredibly hateful and threatening things about J, L, B, C, and much more people. Again, the whole time they are telling me that its fine because they are mentally ill and that this is their way of releasing those emotions, and that those people were rude to them before so the hate was justified.

Because of this, another user on the social media makes one final callout about S. This post was a revelation to me. At the absolute least (because I just checked the responses to the new callout), 9 people responded the post with their own stories about how they were treated poorly by S. Including the previously mentioned J, L, B, and C, with the latter two bringing up how toxic the relationships were and how in C's case S triggered lots of harmful behavior, and in B's case felt that their sexuality was being invalidated by S (B was aro, but felt forced to stay)

After that, S started to heavily vent and make threats on multiple of their accounts and vague-posted about me and everyone they knew. 

This is where I think I made a mistake/ actually became the asshole.  I made my own callout against S with my own proof and points. and behind the scenes I reached out to S to tell them to apologize and better themselves. But, the past few days they've been ghosting me- and anytime I reach out to anyone (C luckily responded), none of them respond.

At this point, everyone who is involved or knows about the situation sticks on one side and pushes heavily for it. I want everyone affected by S to be apologized to but also want S to be okay, even though the stuff they've done gets worse and worse the more that comes out.

I started in February 2024 after I got out of the Navy and no one would hire me because I don't have a bachelors degree. He works back of house, I'm a server. We've gone out to lunch a couple times, I realized he liked me as more than a friend and I told him I don't want anything more than that right now because I don't want to date where I work. But I'm planning on going to college full time soon and then I will quit my server job and we can see about a relationship. He agreed. 
     Last night we went out to dinner, I had 2 huge margaritas, he had 2 huge beers, and he orders 3 shots for us. I'm a tiny human, 5ft, he's 6ft. I got way more drunk than i should have and wind up throwing up in the parking lot right in front of him. Now, I got him an uber to get to the restaurant, my mom who doesn't work due to back pain lives with me, she dropped me off and picked me up. I tried to get Cody an uber home, but the driver cancelled because I was drunk. Well my mom picked me up and brought me home. Don't know how Cody got home. 
     This morning I wake up to a FB message he sent me last night about a ""door test"". It's a video from a movie saying that if you unlock a door for a lady and she gets in but doesn't let you in, she's a selfish broad and you should dump her. I explain to Cody I did try to get him an uber but I didn't want to be in the same car with him at that point because of how incredibly humiliated I felt, also offered to pay my half of the meal because we're just friends and both friends pay for a meal.He hasn't responded. So I don't know exactly how he feels or what's going through his mind. But I have a couple thoughts on that video. 
     1, everywhere you see girls doing dumb ""relationship tests"" on their guys. Personally, I don't participate in such nonsense because I think to really get to know someone, you need to put in the work. 2, those ""tests"" are usually done when both parties are in their right minds. 3, if you're upset I didn't let you get a ride home with me, tell me so. Use your words, not a video, you're a man, not a boy, right? 4, I think it's incredibly insulting to say I'm selfish based off that 1 incident when dude I got you and uber there, tried to get you one back, you even said you'd walk back earlier before the dinner, now you're upset that you're being held to your word? But I'm selfish? I take care of a mother that was abusive to me, the reason I left for the Navy in the first place, because she's still my mom and I love her, but I'm selfish? Maybe get to know a person first before deciding that based off of 1 dumb ""test"" when they're not even in their right mind. If you're gonna play games with me and not use your words to communicate, maybe it's for the best he wants nothing to do with me anymore, because now I'm not sure I want anything to do with him.

57,1d7cbq5,AITA for getting into an argument with my mother about her car insurance,"I (42M) got into a blowout argument with my mother (74F) over her car insurance company.

A couple of months ago, she was in a hurry and hit another car (her front bumper to their rear wheel well). Because it was a pretty mild accident, she gave the other driver her insurance info and sped away from the scene. Later, she found out that the other driver had filed a police report and a claim for damages. Repairs came out to \~$1400, which her insurance paid.

My mother does not speak English fluently, so she asked me to call her insurance company to clarify whether or not they had investigated the damage on the other car and to request a picture of the damage. Her insurance company (the Hartford) said that they’d received an invoice from a mechanic and would submit a request for a photograph. This was about a month ago.

Yesterday, she called to complain about her insurance company’s handling of the issue. She still hadn’t received this picture and she found it outrageous that the company paid out without sending anyone to inspect the damage. Her main argument is that she had called the police station and the police officer who took the original report said the damage “didn’t seem too bad.” Also, she’d glanced at the other car before driving away and it “seemed fine.”

I disagreed because neither she nor the police is qualified to make this evaluation and $1400 doesn’t seem unreasonable for axle and body repairs. I also refused to call the company again because I don’t think she has the right to demand pictures from the other party. I argued that she’s been in at-fault accidents where her insurance paid out without having sent an adjuster and she didn’t think that was poorly handled, so I didn’t see how this was different. Her response was that she had seen the damage in those accidents, whereas she did not see it here.

We got into a huge argument and she declared that I didn’t understand how car insurance works, asked why I always sided against her, and said that if I cared about our relationship, I’d handle this for her, which eventually became, “Don’t even bother. I know how you really feel about me now.” Rather than continuing to escalate the argument I cut the call short.

I’m second guessing myself, however, because she’s right in that I made some assumptions on how car insurance companies work. She also wasn’t actually asking anything from the company at this point - she was just ready to leave if she felt they hadn’t done their due diligence. In retrospect, I think I was trying to talk her out of switching insurance (again) for what I thought were bad reasons, and because I’d be the one trying to get quotes (again) from companies while she demanded to know why they were so expensive. Maybe I should’ve just made the calls.

59,1d7c128,AITA for not helping my brother out with talking to his kids?,"My brother is a pretty crappy parent and person generally. He was married and cheated on his first wife a lot. She didn't know until she was already sick and that made an already upsetting and traumatic experience for her kids worse. AT the time my niece was 10 and my nephew was 8. His first wife kicked him out and filed for divorce. They actually did get divorced before she died but it was very close. My brother didn't even try to be there for his kids. He only stepped in once their mom had died and even that felt very uninterested. 

After several months of living like that he decided he'd find a girlfriend and get someone to raise his kids for him. He went through three before finding his current wife. The three before her ran when they realized the kids were not going to play nice with them and did not want a new mom like my brother wanted this girlfriend to be. But his wife didn't care if the kids didn't like her. She's very harsh and roughly spoken and controlling and tries to dictate their every move. She declared herself the kids mom whether they liked it or not and said she would not tolerate anything less than full respect, including 'the correct title' which was mother or mom.

The kids hate her. They're now 14 and 16 and they hate her. I'm not entirely sure she doesn't hate them too. I don't think she expected them to refuse her for this long but that's what's been happening. My parents have stepped in and tried to help and get my brother to realize his kids need a different kind of help (therapy) but he wants his wife to take care of all kid related stuff. Even CPS calls did nothing. He's actually a better husband to this wife, though that took a few years, but he stopped sleeping around and he and his wife seem to get along fine.

Where all this is leading to is this; my brother's wife lost two children before she met my brother. She had a 2 year old who passed from an allergic reaction and a stillbirth some months after the loss of her first child. She was left sterile after this. My brother's wife is down around the anniversary of her children's deaths. She and my brother expect his kids to be kinder to her then but they do everything to upset her more and taunt her about it. They throw some of her words back when questioned on it (that they don't care what she has to say and they say what she does or doesn't deserve). My niece told her she wasn't good enough to be a mother and she felt bad that the kids had her (brother's wife) as a mom.

The kids were punished and my brother tried to intervene but of course it didn't help. So he asked me to step in and help him talking to the kids about cutting this out. He said they'll destroy his wife if they keep being so vicious about this. I refused to help him. I already know it won't do any good because the household is too toxic. My parents offered to take the kids off their hands but my brother said no and that I should help him and yelled when I said no.

The kids were punished and my brother tried to intervene but of course it didn't help. So he asked me to step in and help him talking to the kids about cutting this out. He said they'll destroy his wife if they keep being so vicious about this. I refused to help him. I already know it won't do any good because the household is too toxic. My parents offered to take the kids off their hands but my brother said no and that I should help him and yelled when I said no.

60,1d7bwkn,AITA for confronting my housemate about returning a discounted item and shortchanging me on a purchase?,"So I (33M) work for an electronics retailer where I get extremely generous staff discounts. Whilst technically against policy, a lot of employees purchase for friends. I myself am pretty liberal with this and will hook up a lot of friends and sometimes friends of friends with staff deals. I never ask for anything in return, a simple word of appreciation will always do just fine.

Recently, I offered to help my housemate's (30F) boyfriend find a Mother's Day gift from the retailer. They ended up purchasing a cheap neck massage pillow but as the pillow wasn't in stock at my store I arranged to send them a link so they could click and collect it form another store. At the same time my housemate requested a phone case which I got transferred into my store.

Later that week my housemate reimbursed me for the case, however she short changed me on it. It was the first time this has happened, it was only a small amount and in the past before she has often rounded up to the nearest dollar amount when reimbursing me for purchases. The principal of being short changed for helping someone out did kinda irk me, but overall not really a big deal and that alone was not enough for me to raise as an issue.

Then that weekend her and her bf returned the neck pillow without consulting me. This frustrated me so I raised it with my housemate and explained that when I send a link for a click and collect purchase this goes under my own sales stats and so it fucks up my stats. Whilst I'm generally pretty liberal with making purchases for others, there's not many people I'll send a link for as I don't want to constantly ruin stats but was happy to do for her/her bf as she's not just a housemate but a good friend.

I said I understood that she may not realise that back end side of it, but I'd have thought it was common courtesy that if someone hooks you up with something you'd hit them up to actually check if its all good to return rather than just telling them you're returning it as you're going out the door to do so. And since we were on the subject I also raised that I was frustrated about being short changed on the case.

Basically she got on the defensive and blamed me for being too liberal with my discount.

I walked away from the conversation feeling more frustrated than I had going into it and so after taking some time to reflect I raised it with her again the next week and the whole thing just blew up. She again got very defensive and made me feel as though I was the one who had done wrong.

I feel that all it would have taken was a ""sorry dude I didn't realise and I'll be more mindful in future"" and the whole conversation would have been over the first time I raised it.

I've spoken to a couple of friends who seem ambivalent on the issue. But the way she has responded has me questioning myself.

one thing i should mention is that i have a very severe problem with hair. like seeing people’s hair, being near it, stray hair—especially if it’s wet. OCD runs in my family and i highly suspect that’s where it stems from. it makes navigating my day to day life very hard. i have specific routines with my Own hair to make it as bearable as possible, but even then, it’s still difficult to live with. my mom and sister are fully aware of this problem.

so. i was worried when my mom mentioned inviting this friend because she has long hair and there is only one bathroom in the place we’re renting. but i didn’t want to ruin her fun so i didn’t intervene. i did ask if her friend would bring her daughters. she has two daughters around my sister and i’s age who also have long hair. my mom assured me they wouldn’t come. but then later took it back and said they were. we had to change the place we were renting to an even smaller one that had more beds, but less space. my sister and i would be sharing an extremely small room with two bunk beds and 1 closet with these girls. 

the day of the actual trip, she invited another friend last minute without informing us who would sleep on the couch. it was just the worst experience for me. i was so uncomfortable, i couldn’t even shower while i was there because their hair got EVERYWHERE in the bathroom. there was no sense of privacy at all. the room was so small barely three people could comfortable stand in there. 

i did vocalize my feelings to my mom on a few occasions and she brushed them off so i stayed quiet. it’s possible that i was grouchy, but it wasn’t purposeful. i wasn’t rude to the girls who were with us, i spent time with them a lot. on the third day there, i got my period. it came early, i had no pads. i bled all over my sheets in the room i was sharing with 3 other girls—2 of which were basically strangers to me. i was so embarrassed. i begged my mom through tears to please let us leave early, but she refused.

when we finally got home the first thing my mom did was ask me why i was so horrible to her this week. i was so confused. i asked her what she meant. she told me i was a constant downer and all i did was complain. the discussion ended in a huge fight and she said that i was mentally ill for the way i acted and needed to be hospitalized. my sister remained neutral.

To be able to book a tattoo or consultation with this man or his studio, you have to be able to pay a deposit fee of under a hundred dollars (I don’t want to be too specific with the price in case anyone knows the tattoo shop I am talking about).


I got to the tatto shop state, stayed with my aunts, and went for my appointment. I did my check-in, showed ID, then went to the tatto artist, and he looked at me and asked how old I was.

I am young, and this tattoo is going to limit my job prospects and how I am perceived (he even asks me what I want to do professionally).

63,1d7bs3q,AITA for considering not inviting my stepmom to my future wedding?,"A little back story, my dad and mom got a divorce when I was a junior in HS (so 12 years ago now) due to a lot of bad decisions on his end. Flash forward to my early college days he meets the love of his life (my now stepmom) and ever since she came around things have been so complicated for me. 

It’s like she finds enjoyment in making me suffer, but she does this in a subtle covert narc type of way where only I can see/ feel what’s happening. Everyone else around her (my dad’s side of the family and all their friends) think she is like this angel who is incapable of doing any wrong. 

I moved out of my dad’s house when I was 21 because he forced me to so he could be alone with his new wife. That was fine because tbh I didn’t want to be there either. 
I have always been very independent and don’t ask for help, I will always figure things out for myself. 

Anyway… I have been with my significant other for about 8 years now (almost the same amount of time my dad and his wife have been together). My SO and I are discussing wedding plans and my stepmom every single time I bring it up has the biggest hissy fit. 
She has told me that I am selfish for wanting a big wedding with all my family there because I’m not thinking about her and my dad’s feelings. (She is insecure about having to be around my mom and her family for a day…)  
She is very manipulative by saying “well just think about it, you’ll probably change your mind” she has also told me “well are you going to have two different aisles to walk down?” In a condescending tone. Or.. “you should have two separate weddings” as if I’m just made of money. But also that’s not what I want even if I could afford that. 

When my brother passed, her and my dad didn’t even go to his funeral (because everything is about the divorce and avoiding my mom at all costs) and blamed me for convincing my mom to have a funeral for him. It’s like they project their guilt of failure on me instead of taking accountability for their lack of empathy. 

So AITA for being fed up with the emotional abu*e and not wanting her at my wedding?

64,1d7bigc,AITA for using my dead father's money?,"My dad passed away about  years ago. He and I shared the family house and I took care of him as he aged. Last week, the bank called me and notified me that my dad’s bank account would be closed and sent to the state unless one of his next of kin could come and show his death certificate and then close the account and take the money. There is approximately $12K in there.

For some back ground. I am one of 4 siblings. One of my brothers also passed away so it’s it’s just me, my sister and brother. My brother (50) and sister (48) both live in their own places. My brother is married with 2 kids. His wife lives across the country and as a result of this 10 year arrangement, I have been instrumental in helping raise his kids. I take them to school every day, watch them after school. I have even changed my work schedule to accommodate their schedules and extracurricular activities. Mind you, their mom has had many opportunities to transfer back to our area, but insists that it’s more cost effective for her to keep her current position. (it’s a long touchy subject).

My sister, is single and an attorney. She lives alone in an apartment with her animals. My sister has a habit of leaving her adopted animals at my house since it is still considered ‘the family home’. That means some of her pets have now become my responsibility. She will buy the food, but otherwise, I take care of her animals, including taking them to the vet. She will sometimes chip in for the bill in these cases. She also uses my house as her storage since she has a small place. This includes her car that she doesn’t drive. Her company pays for a car so the one she bought sits in my driveway unused. I have asked her to get rid of it, but she insists that she will need it someday.

Since I still live in the family home, there have been several upkeep items over the years that I have paid for along with my dad. Since my dad passed away, there have been so many things needing repair. The pool pump broke, once it drained it was discovered it needs to be replastered. I was quoted $9K and I cannot afford that on my own. I asked my siblings for help since they use the house as well for storage, their kids, pets etc.  They both told me they couldn’t afford to help me. The garage door has also been leaking when it rains. It’s a wood door and after a heavy rain it became very damaged. There are also many other items that have been going into disrepair since my dad died. He used to take care of much of the house upkeep since he was retired.

65,1d7bh2m,WIBTA for bailing on a girls trip to the East Coast after Airbnb price doubled without being given a chance to accept/decline? ,"So 2 of my girlfriends planned a trip to the East Coast and invited me to join with a group of 8 girls total. I committed with the assumption that the Airbnb would cost around $300 pp for 3 nights. After I committed, I asked my 2 friends to confirm the price of the Airbnb, which went without a reply. I saw them the next night as we were out to dinner together with a group and one had mentioned that the host cancelled our Airbnb and they were scrambling to find another place to stay, but rest assured it will work out but everyone might need to pay a little more. I didn’t ask anything further and assumed it would be another $100 or so. Which would have been fine with me. The following day, the new Airbnb gets sent into the group chat that it’s been booked and it would now be $700 pp. I was not expecting to spend this much on a 3 night stay plus airfare being an additional $300 which totals $1k before even spending a dime there. I thought that would be close to my all in expenses of the trip. I’ve decided I don’t want to go anymore given the cost and lack of transparency before booking the new Airbnb without my agreement. Everyone else in the group seemed to be on board with the cost but maybe since they’ve already booked their flights, they don’t want that to be a sunk cost too. 

So, WIBTA for bailing on the trip? I feel bad realizing the rest of the group will have to pay closer to $800 per person for their stay, but that also could have been sorted out and disclosed before the place was booked.

Earlier this year (around March?) had bought tickets to a couple events and I had booked a hotel room (not paid yet though, pay at check in). Last month, I met someone and we hit it off instantly. We started dating and have since become and exclusive couple. My new boyfriend lives in downtown and has a guest bedroom.

68,1d7b4q0,AITA for choosing to travel alone to my fiance's army graduation after my FIL and MIL disrespected me?,"For context my fiance (19m) and I (19f) have been together for over a year but have known each other for 15 years. We grew up together due to MIL and my parents were good friends. The timeline goes: we got engaged in December 2023 he signed his army contract in March 2024 got shipped out in April 2024 is set to graduate from BMT in June 2024 then AIT in September 2024.

I've maintained a civil relationship with MIL and FIL and it’s gone well for the last year. I've known MIL for a long time but I hadn't met FIL until mid 2023. They've been divorced for a very long time.

The issues start last week when I got in contact with FIL about the graduation and he told me that he didn't want me or my parents to go (I needed to go with my mom/dad cause I can't rent a car/get a hotel under 21) because it's too personal to share the day with anyone else. He also said the day was too important to him and that since fiance and I are so young we have time together when he comes back from AIT.

Of course this upsets me but I didn't respond to him I didn't want to possibly say something disrespectful or cause more drama. It got resolved the next day when MIL and my mom discussed the issue and I was going to travel with MIL and MIL talked to FIL about being chill about me tagging along.

Now onto the current issue with MIL. She's a boy mom and used to being the most important woman to her husband and kids. Which fair. I'm not going to take away that she's their mom. However comma. I'm not going to take any disrespect. I had my weekly phone call with fiance where he tells me that MIL was complaining about the tap out and that she wanted to do it even though she knew that fiance wanted it to be me. In that moment MIL texts me informing me that she wanted to be the one to tap him out and that even if I wanted to it's what she wants. I responded hours later where I only said that fiance wanted me to do it so what were we going to do?

She quickly got on the offensive and says that she's his mom and because of that it's going to be her and that's it no more arguing. She also lied about fiance telling her to say that when it wasn’t true because he and I were on the phone when she initially texted me. Anyways since she said no more arguing I didn't text back. Until FIL sends me another message. He texts me telling me that he didn’t support certain things about my relationship with his son and that she's his mother who birthed him and it's her right to do the honors and that after this message there's no more contest.

Idk who’s  initiating any kind of competition or contest cause it certainly isn't me. I've remained respectful and polite. But after these conversations I decided to back out of traveling with MIL and make my own travel arrangements. Clearly I am disturbing the peace so I'll travel alone to stay out of the way. I know when she sees my text she'll have something (probably not so nice) to say.

69,1d7aqmf,AITA for not sharing food?,"| (27M) usually get anything my GF (31F) whatever she wants in terms of food (usually when we can) we always share and we invite each other out all the time.

Yesterday we had come from a party pretty hung over and slept/stayed in bed almost all day. For lunch I made us some quick hot dogs with fries and for dinner she said that we would get take-out because the kitchen was also a mess.

7PM came around and she had just woke up by around 8PM I told her I was starving. She said she didn't feel like waking up or going out but did offer to door dash something for me since she had offered which I then declined since those apps charge way too much for something I could do literally 5 minutes. I said it was fine and that I would make a little something. This is where things changed...

I then went to the kitchen and after some looking around I started to make made myself some nachos.

I then went to ask my GF in 5 separate times if she would want some so that I could make some for her.

She told me after the second time ""I'll just have a bite of yours"" which I replied to with ""No, l'll make you a separate plate and when you are hungry eat from there"" she said ""ok"" but I still asked three more times just to be sure to which she said ""Its ok. I'll just have the leftovers in the fridge"" to which I said ""ok""

Then as I'm getting ready to sit down to eat I remembered my phone in the kitchen and as I'm walking away she says ""Can I have a bite?""
Admittedly as I am walking away I did sigh because it annoyed me. But once I got back I said ""sure"" but at that point she was already upset because ""yr are supposed to share with the person you love Which vee its trile hut Tacked tive different times lol

70,1d7anr0,AITA For Making My Friend Mad After I Left Her Birthday Party Early?,"TW: nsfw act named, hospitals, medicine


Hey I’m not gonna disclose my name or my age on here but I will say I’m in my teens and that I am female. I also posted this in r/AITA but I figured I wanted to post it in a server that has more people.

So for context my friend, ima call her Leslie, has been through a lot, her mom is mentally ill (she’s on ketamine), CPS has been called on her mom multiple times, mental hospital multiple times etc, she’s been through a lot.

So I was with Leslie, her bf (I’ve only ever been texting and have been on calls with him) I will call Nathan and another girl who was supposed to come but couldn’t make it (this is important later) for her birthday party. Her dad drove us downtown, we got worn out and drove back up. 

We were at her house chilling and we put on a true crime podcast. Her couch is a one of those L shaped couches so imagine me sitting at the bottom part of the L and Nathan and Leslie cuddling at the left side of the L. So you know there kissing cuddling whatever. I’m playing Gartic Phone with them. I hear a creak on the couch. I didn’t look but I hear more creaking I didn’t wanna be a creep so I looked at the corner of my eye to see them let’s just say dry jumping eachother Leslie texted me earlier saying that I could say stop but I figured it was my time to leave anyway I made an excuse to Leslie that I needed to try on clothes. (Technically I did have to try on clothes but that wasn’t the reason why I left) I texted my mom to come pick me up.

While in the car I texted Hannah (the girl who couldn’t make it originally) saying that if Nathan was to be there, to reconsider it so that she didn’t have to get put in the position I’m in. She did end up going just without Nathan there. And I thought that was that.

Fast forward to a week later and Leslie and Nathan left a group chat me and my friends were in. I was curious so I asked her. Usually she messages right away so after not responding for a couple days I started asking my friends if she has texted them at all this week. All of them said yes. She blocked me and I had no clue why. 

I told one of my friends who I’ll name Sophia, about it and this point it’s 2 weeks later. And Sophia calls her asking why she blocked me. It was because of 2 things. 1) lying to her to try on clothes when I really just wanted to leave even though I could say to stop. And 2) telling Hannah some advice in case Nathan was going. She also accused me of doing some other things. 1) ghosting her and 2) having beef with her. Lemme remind you I never blocked her and instead of telling me in the first place she straight up blocked me. 

I feel like I’ve done nothing wrong but I would get mad if someone lied to me as well. She’s also unfriended me on multiple platforms (TikTok, Roblox (we troll on there lol)) the only platforms she hasn’t unfriended me on is Locket (if y’all know what that is)

71,1d7am4w,AITA for not allowing my dog in my bed?,"I (34f, single, live alone) adopted a six-year-old shih tzu mix from a shelter last year. He has adjusted to life with me, he's very well behaved, my widdle sweetie and lovebug and mama's baby, and we have a lot of fun together on my days off.
 
I've started a job with three 12hr shifts per week, so my parents watch him at their home when I'm working. They have always said it's no trouble and that he's a joy to have around. My dog is always happy to go over there and he's obsessed with my dad.

I had two rules for my dog and I made sure my family knew them: he sleeps in his own bed and he only eats dog food. My mom had a habit of feeding her dog table scraps, even though it would often be things with garlic and onion, which are not good for dogs. She also let her dog sleep in her bed. I have never wanted this because I like a clean bed free of hair and smells. My dog is allowed on any other furniture and in any part of the house. He tried to get in bed with me the first two days but since then has gone straight to his own bed, in my bedroom, and that's our routine. 

Recently went on a short vacation with my family, where I said my dog could sleep in my room in the Airbnb, as we had brought his bed with us. My mom overruled me for some reason, and I was too tired to fight, so I said whatever. The next day I learn she let my dog AND my brother's dog sleep in the bed with her. There was no room for my dad and he had to sleep on the couch. 

The next night I was trying to sleep at about 9:30 PM, as I was worn out dn't feel like going to a fireworks show with everyone else and thought my dog would be scared of them anyway. My mom flung open the door to my room (she doesn't know how to knock, I guess) and told my brother to put my dog on my bed. I argued back, no, let's get HIS bed and he can sleep on the floor next to me as that's what we do at home.

Since then my mom has been talking shit about me, telling the rest of the family that I shouldn't have a dog and accusing me of never paying attention to him. That's verifiably false. 

I'm getting a little paranoid and wondering if she's trying to slowly take him from me. (I had a 9-5 job when I adopted him, but had to quit to maintain my sanity. I wouldn't have gotten a dog with my current schedule and consider my parents' help a blessing. I talked about getting a walker or looking at daycares and they wouldn't hear of it.)

72,1d79zpf,WIBTA Roommate gave key to gf without asking,"Hello!

I(24M) have an ongoing issue with a roommate of mine (24M) who is a family friend. Roommate has a girlfriend(30F) of 6-7 months who within the last month has started to be at the house daily. Prior to that my roommate asked if I was okay with how she had been coming over recently (3-4 days a week). I said that is fine and I have no issues with how it’s been. Then it escalated very quickly. My opinion aside on that, he then gave her a key to the house without asking and his explanation was “I’m in my room so he figured I wouldn’t care”. I stay in my room while they are in common areas out of respect to their privacy which I told him. The situation in his eyes is she gets off and comes to the house 2 hours prior to him every day due to a 20 min drive where she lives and that it just “makes sense” for her to have the key so they can “hang out”. She will be at the house at times for 2-3 hours before he is here. She brings a bag, washes clothes, showers here, eats here, etc. In his words he wants to “hang out” with her and that’s why she has the key so she doesn’t have to drive home then here. I work from home and work in the garage or my office and have a dog as well which is more irrelevant but comes into play as at times she will sit outside until he comes home and I am uncomfortable with sitting out there with my dog while she sits on the deck and does not talk. She is very anti social(his words not mine) and never talks besides very basic greetings despite trying to get her to open up some. I wanted to address this in person but I have not had a time where he has been alone in a month and I did not want to embarrass her with the conversation. So I texted him, while apologizing for it being over text, that I am not okay with anyone who doesn’t live here having a key and that it makes me uncomfortable. I said it feels as if she lives here now and that it was never discussed. I told him I am open to the idea but we need to talk about it first. His reply was trying to rationalize not asking me before doing it and then that was it. Today we will be speaking in person about the situation. I feel I already know the answer but would like a general consensus on this subject especially considering it’s a family friend and an argument would cause issues. WIBTA to firmly say I am not okay with her having a key unless we agree she moves in and starts contributing to things like the rent and utilities?

I expect a reaction but we’ll see. Thanks for the support!***",Not the A-hole,2024-06-03,"WIBTA Roommate gave key to gf without asking Hello!

I(24M) have an ongoing issue with a roommate of mine (24M) who is a family friend. Roommate has a girlfriend(30F) of 6-7 months who within the last month has started to be at the house daily. Prior to that my roommate asked if I was okay with how she had been coming over recently (3-4 days a week). I said that is fine and I have no issues with how it’s been. Then it escalated very quickly. My opinion aside on that, he then gave her a key to the house without asking and his explanation was “I’m in my room so he figured I wouldn’t care”. I stay in my room while they are in common areas out of respect to their privacy which I told him. The situation in his eyes is she gets off and comes to the house 2 hours prior to him every day due to a 20 min drive where she lives and that it just “makes sense” for her to have the key so they can “hang out”. She will be at the house at times for 2-3 hours before he is here. She brings a bag, washes clothes, showers here, eats here, etc. In his words he wants to “hang out” with her and that’s why she has the key so she doesn’t have to drive home then here. I work from home and work in the garage or my office and have a dog as well which is more irrelevant but comes into play as at times she will sit outside until he comes home and I am uncomfortable with sitting out there with my dog while she sits on the deck and does not talk. She is very anti social(his words not mine) and never talks besides very basic greetings despite trying to get her to open up some. I wanted to address this in person but I have not had a time where he has been alone in a month and I did not want to embarrass her with the conversation. So I texted him, while apologizing for it being over text, that I am not okay with anyone who doesn’t live here having a key and that it makes me uncomfortable.

73,1d79w0f,AITA for getting a tattoo behind my mom’s back?,"I’m F, 16 and I got a tattoo on my 16th birthday in February which my dad took me to get. The deal was my mom absolutely was not allowed to know because she would unsurprisingly be pissed. I know this could be seen as a major form of disrespect towards her and y’all are also probably thinking that I come from a divorced home, but that isn’t the case. My parents are still together but there are a lot of issues not including the tattoo. At this point in my life, I’m fine with disrespecting my mother, she has lost all respect and love from me with her actions which I will explain.

From a young age my mom had to work a lot overseas and my dad was my primary caretaker. This of course made me have a stronger bond with my dad. By the time my mom stopped going overseas I was around 4-5 years old and from what I remember around that time my mother was very loving. As I got older though, I started realizing a lot of things. 

Things such as, my mother is a narcissist, she only cares about herself and things that will bring her a good image. When we go on trips “as a family” she always books herself on delta and my dad and I on frontier. She will never apologize because she believes she is never in the wrong. At her job (when she used to be a supervisor of a CSI unit) she expected everyone to do their job exactly as SHE wanted them to. Even if they completed tasks, if they weren’t up to her specific standards she would scold them, but also not show them what they did wrong. This behavior was brought into our home as well with her not being satisfied with most things me or my brother did as it was not the way she wanted.

All those may seem like she’s just very strict but the final thing that pushed me off the edge was I found out my mom cheats on my father. This wasn’t a “one night stand” or a “mistake” I mean she constantly cheats on him. When I found out, it shattered me. I love my dad so much and he is the sweetest person I know and to found out my mother blatantly disrespects him like this, I was heartbroken. My dad knows I know and I’m constantly trying to convince him to divorce her. My mom knows partially that I know as I snapped saying I did in an argument we had. She had been trying to guilt trip me saying, “I don’t know why you don’t love me,” and other similar lines just egging me on and on and finally I snapped asked, “How could you cheat on dad?” I then went to my room but about an hour later she comes in “crying” about how her childhood was so difficult and I could never understand. She just spewed information completely irrelevant to what I had called her out on just to play victim.

I’m a very loyal and respectful person and if my dad had told me I couldn’t get the tattoo then I would have respected his wishes. After everything my mom has done which there is a lot more I haven’t mentioned, I can’t look at her without seeing someone who betrayed my dad, who betrayed me, who betrayed our family. So, AITA?

74,1d79vi1,AITA for not telling my father that I don’t have the funds requested by him,"I 20 (M) am an international student who came to Canada to study. Growing up, I had a tough relationship with my father. It was a hard environment since he has always been an academic person and wants me to be the same. We are not wealthy people, we are just an average family back home. He has always been strict on me achieving something big in life. He has always compared me to my grandfather who was the King’s advisor back then and has always said that I have to achieve something bigger in life than my grandfather.

Since my father has experienced the culture and educational systems of the various countries he has travelled to, he has always regarded the American education to be at the top. The problem began when I was around 18. I started to get more and more frustrated because my dad was always on my back saying “oh you got to do this, you got to read this book in your free time and oh you got to go to America for your education”. I saw no hope in living.

To this day, the only person who knows about this is my girlfriend who I met a few months after that. I didn’t want to live in the same house as my parents who are constantly bickering about money. I was desperately trying to get away. I told my dad I would really love to go to Japan since I was studying Japanese on my own, and I really loved the country. He wouldn’t listen and told me I had to go to north America so that my English could be better. I was sad but any part of the world away from home would be good so I apply for the student visa but get rejected, and my dad starts lecturing me on how I had to get an A to go into a good university and it was all my fault.

She wanted me to apply too. Since my father is so hell bent on sending me to north America to study, he quickly agreed.

I got my visa and came to Canada. I was so happy that I could be independent and enjoy my life with my love, but turns out my dad had taken several loans for god knows what and I recently found out that it exceeds $2 million. 

I had to pay my fees to my college to get registered for the semester so I asked him to give me around $7k. The rest I had saved up from working. However, the problem was that he sent me only 4k.

I assumed he sent me the amount I asked for but a few weeks later he phoned me and said he needed the 3k back to pay my sister, oblivious to the fact that I had paid everything to my tuition and began to shout at me.

77,1d79rvt,AITA for asking my husband to have our friend tone down her behavior around him?,"I (female, 35) and my husband (male, 40) have been friends with another couple that we met through our kids at school. Recently, I've been feeling uncomfortable due to the behavior of my friend (female, 38). She has a personality that craves attention and has been making comments about her body that are obviously untrue (like, being fat and ‘having a huge ass’). Despite being very slender, she recently got breast implants and has been overly suggestive towards my husband.

During a recent get-together at their pool, while we were all a bit tipsy and playing beer pong, my friend made several inappropriate gestures towards my husband, including shaking her breasts and on several other occasions has smacked his butt and pinched his nipple. While she also does similar things to me (minus the pinching of my nipple part), it is starting to make me feel uncomfortable. I don’t see her exhibit these behaviors towards anyone else. Not sure if they are just incredibly comfortable with us or something? I am aware that both her husband and her have a raunchier than normal sense of humor, which to be fair, so does my husband but it seems like this is happening more often and she even jokingly called my husband ‘daddy’ when he purchased something for our group the other day.

I discussed my feelings with my husband, questioning his reaction to her behavior, which led to an argument between us. We haven't spoken for two days now and I'm unsure how to address the situation. I do value our friendship, especially since our kids are in the same small class, but I find myself wanting to distance myself from this couple due to the uncomfortable situation.

78,1d79hng,AITA for getting burnt out from my friend's excessive daily audio messages? ,"I have an internet best friend of almost 5 years. I love talking to him and he makes me laugh every day and he is my best friend. A few years ago he started sending audio messages while he was walking his dogs and I would respond via text. Sometimes I would get burnt out but just dealt with it because it wasn't worth the fight. I occasionally have brought it up that he's being excessive and ask if he can type more but he ignores it or gets mad at me and leaves me on open and acts like I'm a bad friend. The other day he sent me 35 minutes of audio in one session. Last night he sent 15 minutes of audio after midnight and all the notifications woke me up. I had to get up at 5 AM. Typically he sends chunks of audio in the morning/I wake up to some from after I fell asleep, at lunch, the early evening when I'm trying to eat dinner, when he walks the dogs in the evening, and usually before I fall asleep. 

He adds so many unnecessary details and tells me about things that I just don't care about. Telling me how his hair was that day doesn't need to be a lengthy 5+ minute audio conversation. I've asked him so many times not to send them while he drives but he still does and it makes me very uncomfortable which I have clearly stated many times. 

This morning I said he needed to relax with the audio and I acknowledged that I knew it would make him mad but that I was getting burnt out and it was so excessive.

79,1d79ftr,AITA for telling my family your daughter(16F) is spoil and rotten,"Iam 20F have a younger sister 16F. Let’s just say my parents have grown into this “gentle parenting” or just given up on my younger sister. Like for years she would use my expensive markers, wear my clothes (I have a job so I mostly buy my own stuff now and pay bills here and there ) then when she got caught she would start saying no no i didn’t do it I would never do it. And I would obviously be mad I work my butt off for my clothes just for her to be wearing them . We would start having arguments constantly. I my parents would NEVER give her the consequences for what she did. I think she was very much knowing what she did because she would try to hide it. Anyway lately she been acting like she all that but in reality she probably stupid academic wise because she forgot to log out of her canvas one day from my Ipad and I got to see her grades she failing most of her classes barely has any A’s as she talks about iam passing my classes yeah yeah she always demanding money and threatening me when I don’t give her 20 biweekly when I get paid and get paid to take the mail out of mailbox or small little things . What do my parents do besides telling her they disagree on her grades they don’t do anything else . But iam in currently in college and since high school I always been push around on my grades. I got a dam C in my art class and my dad started yelling at me but I got A’s on rest of my classes… ok I guess I work 30 some hours a week and go to college I clean and clean like the dam maid here but she gets to play on her phone and maybe boil the chicken? Ok nice today I got a massive argument with her because she was yelling at the kitten for destroying my mom plants and I was taking a nap which woke me up . I had work the day before and work been so bad and mentally draining. I told her she could just pick up the kitten and put it in a room so he would stop destroying the plants and making a mess but no she on her sofa watching TV playing games on her phone as well . I realize there was a lot of shit on the floor and table and all she did was boil chicken.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-03,"AITA for telling my family your daughter(16F) is spoil and rotten Iam 20F have a younger sister 16F. Let’s just say my parents have grown into this “gentle parenting” or just given up on my younger sister. Like for years she would use my expensive markers, wear my clothes (I have a job so I mostly buy my own stuff now and pay bills here and there ) then when she got caught she would start saying no no i didn’t do it I would never do it. And I would obviously be mad I work my butt off for my clothes just for her to be wearing them . We would start having arguments constantly. I my parents would NEVER give her the consequences for what she did. I think she was very much knowing what she did because she would try to hide it. Anyway lately she been acting like she all that but in reality she probably stupid academic wise because she forgot to log out of her canvas one day from my Ipad and I got to see her grades she failing most of her classes barely has any A’s as she talks about iam passing my classes yeah yeah she always demanding money and threatening me when I don’t give her 20 biweekly when I get paid and get paid to take the mail out of mailbox or small little things . What do my parents do besides telling her they disagree on her grades they don’t do anything else . But iam in currently in college and since high school I always been push around on my grades. I got a dam C in my art class and my dad started yelling at me but I got A’s on rest of my classes… ok I guess I work 30 some hours a week and go to college I clean and clean like the dam maid here but she gets to play on her phone and maybe boil the chicken? Ok nice today I got a massive argument with her because she was yelling at the kitten for destroying my mom plants and I was taking a nap which woke me up . I had work the day before and work been so bad and mentally draining. I told her she could just pick up the kitten and put it in a room so he would stop destroying the plants and making a mess but no she on her sofa watching TV playing games on her phone as well . I realize there was a lot of shit on the floor and table and all she did was boil chicken.

The other girl, who I've known since kindergarten and was in my class when I first had my big hearing issues, got offended at this, and told me, ""You're not deaf, I am.""

And I understand that I'm loud, and that not everyone appreciates that, but she just jumped on my case about not being deaf, KNOWING I had those issues in the past. And instead of talking about it to me, she started talking shit to my friends. 

Here's where I could be the asshole. The day after, we were in our hotel getting ready to leave. I made a comment to my friend how ""I could hear them, that my hearing loss was cured."" I made sure to say it right in front of her, too.

84,1d78sjf,AITA for... uhhh... eating the guacamole?,"This incident happened about 15 years ago. It has bugged me regularly every since because I have never been able to fathom out what I did wrong. Perhaps you folks can shed some light on this so I can finally put it to bed!

I'm currently 47NB. I'm also autistic. This happened a year or so before I got my diagnosis. At the time, I was working at a place, and I had a colleague. I can't remember her name... let's call her Tina. Right from when I first started there, it was painfully obvious to me that Tina didn't like me. She just gave off a vibe of sneering disdain that I was used to encountering throughout my life from a few people, mostly women, when my oddball quirky existence didn't fit with their very narrow definition of AFAB neurotypical femininity. But I didn't have to interact with her much, so eh, whatever. She was quite a bit older than me (late 50s at the time), in a senior position, and married to the head of department.

Every few months, there would be a Show & Tell event, where a couple of people would do presentations on cool aspects of their work, there would be a Q&A and then a small buffet. I didn't usually go to these - I can't remember why - maybe a clash with another commitment. But on this occasion, I was able to make it for the first time.

I remember the presentations and the followup Q&As being interesting, and then the buffet started. This was a typical British corporate lunch buffet - some small sandwiches, sausage rolls, scotch eggs... and also a big bowl of nachos with an equally big sealed pot of guacamole dip.

Now, I like guacamole. In fact I adore it - it's one of my absolute favourite things to eat in the world. Imagine me like a cat when there is tuna around, and you'll get the picture. So, when the buffet began, I cracked open that sucker, helped myself to a big handful of nachos, and tucked in.  So here's the mystery. 

* I didn't hoard it in any way. It was in the middle of the table, everyone else could get some too, and many did. 
* While I dipped my nachos straight into the pot, I wasn't double-dipping - I know as well as the next person that this is gross. Other people were doing the same as me. 
* While I did eat a bit more of it than anyone else, it wasn't hugely more, and there really was plenty for everyone. 
* I'm also not in any way a messy eater, a noisy chewer or anything like that. My table manners are up to British standards.
* Nobody seemed at all annoyed or upset with me other than Tina's permanent disdain aura.

After a while, I had eaten my fill and was feeling socialed out. So I made my thanks, cleaned up my things, and put away my plate and cutlery. Everyone else was still eating and chatting, and there was about half of the guacamole left. With that, I headed to my room and got back to work.

About thirty minutes later, Tina comes storming in and slams the pot down on my desk - it's now about a third full. I autisticallly didn't read the room, and was genuinely pleased. Yay, more guac!

""Oh, thank you!"" I said brightly.

""It wasn't a gift!"" she yells, and then she storms out in a fury.

Leaving me completely and utterly mystified, and as there was no way I was going to ask her, and none of the other people ever mentioned it either, I have remained mystified for the last 15 years.

85,1d78shy,AITA for telling my best friend i hope she breaks her arm?,"I’ve got to mention first that this situation occurred around New Years and that it’s been a while. My best friend and i already made up, but whenever she jokes about that situation I can’t help but feel iffy. 

So, I (17F) and my best friend (15F) at the time agreed to attend a new year’s eve party with some of our mutual friends. Basically the only people we would know at that party would be our friend group. We were all pretty excited to go because we didn’t have a lot of parties we could go to.

A week before that party me and another friend of mine had an accident while biking. She had to walk with crutches and I broke my wrist, so i had to wear a cast around my arm.
I told my best friend about my broken wrist, but she didn’t really say anything about it. She talked about coming over to my house, but didn’t do it. I guess that already kind of didn’t sit right with me.

A few days went by and I texted her about New Year’s Eve. My parents didn’t want me to attend the party anymore which I totally understood, but I was still very sad about it. I texted her something like this “ instead of going to the party, can we spend new year’s eve at your house? because i can’t go, my wrist is broken.” She told me she would rather go to the party. 

That stung. In my mind she basically said she would rather go to a party with a bunch of strangers than stay at home watching fireworks with her best friend who literally couldn’t go because her wrist is broken. 

Suddenly I got very mad at her, and i told her through text that “i hope you break your arm someday and then i wouldn’t give a shit about that too”. Then I blocked her for like a day.
I just felt like she didn’t care. I know the text was wrong to send but I felt so hurt.

A day later i hadn’t heard anything from her and I texted our mutual friend about the situation. He took her side, and told me I was being a bitch and an a-hole and was playing the victim. 

I cried my eyes out that day because I really wanted to make up with my best friend and didn’t want to fight. I just wanted to hurt her because she hurt me. That day I also came to her house to bring her chocolates. She told me in tears that I had to leave and then I went home crying. 

So, another day later they went to the party with a bunch of strangers and i stayed home with my parents and a broken wrist. They sent me videos of their night and how fun it was, I didn’t respond and just turned my phone off. 

I just still feel very hurt about that situation. I know I shouldn’t have said what I said to her. But I think I didn’t deserve that horrible New year’s eve either.

88,1d78979,AITA for getting frustrated with my friend on holiday (vacation)?,"This is a situation unfolding right now as I type this. I am currently on a week-long trip from the UK to Orlando, FL with one of my best mates (for the sake of anonymity let’s call him ‘Fred’, which is not his actual name). He normally books multiple holidays for himself throughout the year so when he asked if I wanted to come along on this one, I figured I’d oblige and use it as an excuse to take some much-needed time off from work.

In the months leading up to this trip, I happily left most of the decision-making to ‘Fred’ as he has already visited before and is more familiar with what there is to see and do around here (for example, the Disney parks and Universal Studios). That isn’t to say he hasn’t let me make any of my own decisions, he’s been more than fair in that regard.

But now that we are approaching the end of the week, there are still a number of things we haven’t had time to see or do (of course, a longer holiday would have been ideal but we each had limited availability so could only do 7 days) and this is where the conflict comes in.

I knew from the start that it would be hectic and full-on, that it would probably cost a lot of money and that it would involve a lot of walking every day. I’m not someone who likes to waste a day when the time we have available to do things is short enough as it is. Fred on the other hand is tired from all the non-stop walking from the past 5 days and is worrying about saving money toward the tail end of the trip and seems to just want to stay in his room.

I know that I *could* splash out $150 on a trip to Universal Studios on my own and leave him behind to sleep the day away, but it’s the fact the whole of this morning has already been wasted just trying to establish whether he wants to join me or not. It’s now too late to make a day of it and not really worth the entry fee for what would only amount to a couple of hours at a theme park, and I can’t help but feel irritated by my friend’s apathy. I’ve already expressed my frustration as peacefully as I could but I don’t want to escalate it further.

Equally, I know it’s his right to choose what he wants to do, even if I don’t understand why he wants to sit in his room watching TV or sleeping all day.

They were waiting at their home for us to let them know when to leave, so I called to let them know right as we woke up, and I apologized right away, and we rushed onto the road to get to them. At the time they seemed alright but we still felt bad.

At dinner it was brought up a last time, where he revealed he was furious with us for being late and said he only went because his girlfriend talked him into it, and that he would have cancelled the whole thing if it was his decision. It came across like we were being accused of being late just because we felt like it and that we actually completely selfishly. Considering the time and money we spent just to see them and that we made several apologies, this felt like a slap in the face and there was just an awkward silence from everybody since I couldn't even think of anything to say since I was so stunned.

91,1d77nlz,AITA for being snarky when my MIL walked through the house unannounced?,"My living situation needs explaining. My house is built on a hillside and street level is the top floor. Bedrooms are one floor down. Below that is a ""basement"" unit where my retired MIL lives. She has her own bathroom, kitchen, laundry, etc. To leave the house, she can use an outside staircase which goes all the way up to street level. Or she can come through our space where there's a door between her unit and the upper levels. We bought the house together for financial reasons. The agreement was that my MIL would use the outside stairs when the weather was nice, and use the inside stairs if it was raining or snowing. But she'd have to text us and give us reasonable warning to avoid awkward encounters (e.g. give me enough time to make sure I'm not going to the bathroom with the door open).

Fast forward... my wife and I now have 2 kids (ages 3 & 5). My MIL needed back surgery around 4 years ago. Since that surgery, she's exclusively used the inside stairs to leave and I've bit my tongue and not brought up our original agreement.

The main issue is that she's very inconsistent in texting us. When she does text, it's typically with 2-4 minutes of warning. I live in constant anxiety listening for that door to open. When I hear it, the first thing I do is check my phone. I'd say there's a text message around half the time.

Yesterday, we took our kids out on a day trip and noticed that my MIL parked her car in a way that took me a few attempts to get our van clear. It was also very close to the mailbox. My wife texts her mom and asks her to move her car (literally just 3-4 feet would avoid an angry note from our grouchy mail carrier). We get home 7 hours later and the car hasn't moved so my wife calls out my MIL for that. 2 more hours pass and I hear the door open. I check my phone and there's a ""coming up"" text from my MIL at 4:59PM. It's 5:01PM when I hear the door.

Afterward, my wife made it a point to remind me that her mom texted. Likely because I was visibly annoyed. I respond in an admittedly sarcastic tone ""yeah, 2 minutes ahead."" So my wife gets angry at me and lectures me about how her mom never does anything right, how it's uncomfortable for her to be in between us in an awkward situation, etc.

I asked my bridal party which dates worked for them. I chose a date that everyone agreed on. I paid for the Air BnB myself because weddings are obnoxiously expensive. I wanted to lessen the financial burden on my bridesmaids. The Air BnB is an hour from the city where we live. This isn't ideal, but it made the trip more affordable.

Yesterday, my best friend 35F said she wasn't sure if she could attend my bachelorette party. Her partner's best friends are renewing their vows in the church. They would like her and her partner to be their witnesses. They have already moved the date 2 other times. They told her yesterday that their new date is the same as my bachelorette party. The location of their vow renewal is 4 hours from my bachelorette party location. It's not realistic for her to join later. She said she doesn't feel she can ask them to reschedule and will most likely not be able to attend my bachelorette. 

I told her I thought that was unfair considering I chose a date and venue based on her joining. I feel like she is taking advantage of my patience and friendship. She keeps saying things like ""I'm really sorry, it's just really important to them!"". I should add that she is not particularly close to this couple, she just hopes to be. I had never even heard about this couple's vow renewal until yesterday. My friend and I talk on and off all day. Her boyfriend is also an asshole to her and her friends. He doesn't value us, so I find it hypocritical that she would choose his friends over her own.

97,1d76dgt,AITA for not adjusting to my bf’s schedule by going back to school in person?,"AITA for wanting to go back to campus even though my bf has adjusted his schedule to mine?

I (19F) started dating my boyfriend (25M) a month ago, and the thing is we live 45 mins away from each other so it is sort of a mission to see each other since we both work and we are doing online school right now. His work schedule is always 5 days out of the whole week, and he adjusted his work schedule to have more time to see me, while I work 3 days usually, and whenever we’re off, we see each other. Or he comes to see me before I start my shift.

Fall semester is coming up and the thing is, I have never really done spring or fall online. I’ve only done it during the summer because I don’t like just staying home the whole time, like I want the college experience (mind you I commute though). My best friend of 6 years and I always hung out at school, and we were planning to do that again this fall semester but I told my boyfriend I was going back in person this fall and he got sort of upset at me about it. He was saying how he feels as if I’m not prioritizing him by not taking online classes this upcoming fall so we can see each other more, as he has already adjusted his work schedule so he can come see more. Like I totally understand it, 100%, but it’s not even about my friend of course, I just can’t do a whole semester online because I don’t learn as well as I do in person. 

Now I feel like a prick for making HIM feel like that, and it’s a thing with my mother too. My mother will notice that I’m going to be taking online classes solely for the purpose of seeing him more since she knows I don’t like online classes, and she’ll be upset at me for it so. It’s just so much pressure tbh :( I don’t know what to do to satisfy (?) everyone, like what I want to do is go back in person but maybe only 2 days. Although he said “But what if those are my only 2 days off that week?”. Like agh :( Can someone please tell me if i’m an ahole for wanting to go back lol I’m so confused.

Tldr; Bf adjusted his work schedule to see me more often but I said I wanted to go back to classes in person for the fall semester, so he gets upset and says I dont prioritize him.

98,1d764m9,AITA for telling my SIL I won't change my 4 month old daughter's name for her?,"I gave birth to my daughter, Ember, 4 months ago. My husband and I both loved her name and that's how it was chosen. We announced the day she was born and nobody said anything negative or gave a reason for us not to use it then. I say this because three days ago my SIL, who is married to my brother, sat me down and asked me to change the name because it's the name of her stillborn daughter she had with her ex-husband 7 years ago. She told me she tried to keep it quiet but she couldn't let me keep calling my daughter Ember because it's such a painful reminder for her. She told me she really feels like we should change her name.

I gently told SIL that my daughter was 4 months old and her name is on the birth certificate and it would cost us to change it, so we will not. She told me she tried so hard not to say anything and the fact she did eventually break and bring this up should show how hard this is for her and make me more willing to change the name for her sake.

I told my husband about it afterward and he felt the same way I did. He told me it seemed like a weak excuse to wait four, almost five months, to tell us, when she had the chance long before this. My brother found out about the conversation with his wife and he reached out and told me she mentioned it to him two months ago and that she was battling with asking us to change the name since, but he understands why I said no and supports the decision.

Yesterday she reached out to me again and asked me if we had decided on a new name yet and I told her my answer is still no and she asked why and I told her she waited four months to tell us. She became very angry very quickly and told me if she had lost my niece my response would be different and I should see this as her losing my niece because she would have been if she were alive. She also told me my daughter is going to grow up always hearing about the cousin I gave her the same name as and that I should reconsider before burdening my daughter with that. She told me a good person with good morals would.

I should also mention; I knew she had suffered a pregnancy loss but it was implied she had a miscarriage far earlier and not a stillborn child. I never knew the name or sex. And I never ever heard her use a name for her daughter.

My dad has been great about caring for her the last year - bringing her to appts, checking in on her, doing her shopping, etc. I (33) don’t live in the US anymore, so the responsibility fell on him. 

When my dad told me grandma was going into hospice, I booked my flight to the US. I spent the night with her, and my dad arrived to the hospice the next morning. The doctor told us that morning that she had about a day left. My dad left shortly after and said he wouldn’t be back until tomorrow morning because he was going on a date.  

The next morning, my dad arrived at the hospice, and my gma soon took her last breath. I am so grateful I was able to be there for her. But it was also extremely difficult having been in a similar situation with my mom 3 years ago. 

We drove back to my dad’s house. And his date was at the house. I had to make small talk with her about my travels, what she does for work, etc etc, only an hour after my gma died. 

My dad and her decided to continue their date (2 hours after my grandma died). They went out for breakfast followed by a bike ride in the park while I stayed at home. I don’t have any family or friends that live in this state, so I was all alone. 

I had only been back in the US for less than 2 days, but only spent about 4 hours with my dad. I just couldn’t understand how he would rather spend the final hours of his mom’s life with this random woman rather than spend it with his mom and daughter (who he only sees once a year). 

After the woman left, we started making plans for the celebration of life. He wanted to invite 25+ people but 1) I knew my grandma was only close to a few of them 2) I said that I’m really going to struggle to make small talk with a bunch of people I don’t know and who be barely even knew grandma. 

I said that it was even a struggle to talk to his date this morning. He got super angry and said he had made plans with her weeks ago before we knew about grandma passing. I said that he knew a week ago that I was coming so he could have cancelled a week ago. (To me, that should’ve been a reason enough not to go on a date when your daughter is visiting from abroad). And I said that we also were told yesterday morning (well before their date), that grandma would die within the day, so that he should’ve cancelled then before the date even started. He got really mad and said I don’t care about all that he has done the past year. 

AITA for telling him that he should have cancelled his date? Maybe meeting this woman was something to look forward to and an escape? Or maybe he didn’t have the capacity and this was just a strange way to process his grief?

108,1d73kf9,AITA for telling my friend’s new girlfriend he was the reason she was ostracised and bullied at school?,"My (24F) friend, Adam (24M), has recently started dating Cynthia (23F). The three of us went to the same school but we weren’t friends with Cynthia back then. She was a bit of a weirdo at school but people mostly left her alone because of Adam. He only made sure she was left alone in the beginning because their parents were friends and his parents told him to look out for her.

In our final 2 years, their parents had a big falling out and Adam completely turned against her. I don’t know if he did it intentionally because it all started when someone made a comment about her to him in a group setting and Adam said something along the lines of “who gives a fuck about her?” which a lot of the year took to be a green light to finally be able to openly ostracise and bully her. Adam did encourage it at times I feel by the way he would ignore her in front of people when she tried speaking to him but he mostly just let people bully her without acknowledging it. He was the popular guy in school so one word from him and it would’ve all stopped so I do think he intentionally let her continue to be bullied even when things got really bad.

When he introduced her to us as his girlfriend I just felt so bad for her so when I got the chance to speak to her privately I told her everything I wrote above since I was sure he hadn’t told her. All she said to me was “oh” and then she continued to act like everything was fine but I know she’s since confronted him because he’s blown up at me over it. He said I shouldn’t have gotten involved and that he never bullied her or told anyone else to. He claims he wouldn’t have ever done that to her but I think he’s just rewriting history.

She tried to get me to call her mom in another language because she doesn't like me calling her by her first name (so I just say Ms Last Name) and wanted the respect of a parent name, they talk shit about my mom despite having the affair, they accuse my mom of turning me against them despite my dad taking me to his wife's house when they were having the affair and I saw them together and my dad and his wife tried to move out of state with me so ""we could be a family"".

CONTEXT: I used to go to private schools in my country. My uniform consist of a polo shirt and pants. I used the uniform since I was 4 until 9.

So that was another reason. But when I go outside I use pants. I move to the US when I was 9.

Story: I (16M) have a problem with my grandparents about pants and shorts. I want to clarify that I barely go outside so I mostly use shorts in my house but every time I go outside I use pants. I thought no one had a problem with that until 2 days ago.

My grandparents wanted to visit us from my country. They thought in buy me some clothes. I didn't care about the clothes so I didn't had any problems with that. Until my grandpa ask me about why I don't wear shorts outsides. I said that I just prefer pants.

He is the kind of person that doesn't think about his comments and thinks he is always right. He said that ""Men should wear shorts"" I said that, that was ridiculous, what's wrong with pants? But he made comments that said that ""You aren't a real man"" ""you are soft"" ""girls likes men legs"" ""are you insecure about your legs""

We were in a mall, you know just shopping until my grandpa called me. (I was using pants obviously)He bought a short yesterday. He asked me why I didn't wear the shorts, I was SOOOO tired of his comments. So I said ""OH MY GOD JUST STOP"".

Then he said ""if you don't want them I can just return them"" something I learned in all these years is that if you say ""yes"" to that is going to start drama. Then he said that when he leaves. He wants me to send him a pic of those pants in a store. (Not in my house because he knows I will take them off later)

I just left furiously. Like I know he doesn't know English I play the song ""Obsessed"" by Mariah. He didn't know what it meant but my relative (that does know English) understands the message. So she started laughing.

Since childhood, my sister (29f) and I (26f) have been in this hidden competition encouraged by our parents.

We both have master's degrees, and I just completed mine three days ago, graduating with honors.

When she arrived on the day she got the ring, and all the attention was on her, I left to go home. Later, they told me I didn't wish her happiness.

To give more context, we’ve known since January that my sister would get married because she and her fiancé agreed on it, but she didn’t have the ring until the day after my graduation, which made her engagement official. 

I am sad because graduating with honors took my free time, nerves, and determination, and it has been swept under the rug. I know no one can take my degree away from me, but it hurts a lot, and I feel like crying. I just needed to get it off my chest a little.

My friend usually stays for a month, so a few weeks of bad weather isn't a big deal for him.

So the last two years I left after 1 week, because the weather was clearly not improving, even worse.

My friend is a bit annoyed because he knows I might leave sooner if the weather is bad again this year. For me, a holiday should ideally have sunny weather for most of the trip.

My friend usually stays for a month, so a few weeks of bad weather isn't a big deal for him. However, I only stay for two weeks, and spending my entire holiday under such conditions is really frustrating. Camping and taking showers in 2°C weather is not my idea of a fun holiday. So the last two years I left after 1 week, because the weather was clearly not improving, even worse.

My friend is a bit annoyed because he knows I might leave sooner if the weather is bad again this year. For me, a holiday should ideally have sunny weather for most of the trip. A couple of days of rain is fine, but not the entire week. I can understand that it's not happy about it, but AITA for doing that ? Especially the trip is a bit expensive too.",0.0,0.019763657823204994,0,1
115,1d71tyf,AITA for asking gas money?,"Hi im M19 and i’m currently a student working 1 day a week, which earns me just the right amount of money for gas every week.

My friend has convinced me to start playing tennis and i’ve grown to like the sport alot. Since I’m the only one with a car and drivers license, im the ones picking him up and driving to the tenniscourt which is about 25km from my house. I really dont mind having to be driver and i dont mind him not paying me back, but what i hate is being taking advantage of. 

We’ve had this argument before but like a wise man once said :” its hard to win an argument with a smart person, but its damn near impossible to win against a dumb person.” 

What i ask of him is every 5 times we go to the tenniscourt i ask a miserable €10. 
Now he is angry with me for asking and calls me pathetic for even bringing it up since his house is on the way to the tenniscourt. (he lives 5km away from me)

I’ve tried to reason with him, but his logic says that even if we go to france by car together to for example go on vacation, im driving there anyways so he doesn’t have to pay me.

Is there anyone who has experienced this with there friend and has any tips on what to do going forward?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-03,"AITA for asking gas money? Hi im M19 and i’m currently a student working 1 day a week, which earns me just the right amount of money for gas every week.

116,1d7139r,AITA for putting my bike where nobody could get past it?,"So i 29f got a new bike from my dad some years ago, and i loved it! I used it for everything, and it was nice because i had about 6 Miles or more to the stable. (6 miles is only one way)  And even more to work! And i could go to the stable about 2-3 times pr day if i had to feed the horses or help in the stable. So in a good day it was over 12 miles pr day, and sometimes 24 miles.
So the thing was that my landlord had a shed in the back, and i was told that i could use it. 
But the door was hard to unlock, like i have been living here for over 6 years! And i still have a hard time opening that door… so i would not put my bike in the shed. Because some days i could not unlock it?
So i could put the bike next to the bunny hutch, because there is a lean-to over my apartment door. And a little path from the front of the house to the back of the house right infront of my door.
If you know don’t where im going with this, it was that people would move my bike away from under the lean-to so it would be out in the rain, or out in a snow storm. Once i walked out of my apartment… and someone had put my bike infront of my door, so i feel and almost hit my head into the bunny hutch. (It was morning, and still dark outside)
I have talked a lot with my landlord about it at the time, because my bike did not make it for long, not even a year tbh.
And he would always tell me that he did not know who moved my bike, but it was in the way! So he understood why people would move it? And i was like, im paying over 900 dollars for my apartment with my own garden, and my own entrance! The patch from the front of the house to the back is mine too? So if i want my bike to be under the lean-in i can do that, right? But thats not how it ended, because someone would move my bike almost daily, at the time. But this got me thinking, was i in the wrong for putting it there? I have asked my friends a lor about this and they are split. Because if this is my apartment, and my own entrance who would use that?
So Reddit im a wrong for putting my bike under tredje lean-in?

Side note, my apartment is a house splint in two. Both with own entrance and a garden in the back.

117,1d70vzr,AITA for changing my first name?,"I (20m) never really liked the first name my parents gave me which was William. I grew up around kids who had names I found way cooler, like Hendrix, Hunter, Orion, Forrest, River, Indigo, Ryder, etc. Not that I was the only kid with a ""normal"" or a classic name. But I would say those with ""weird"" or unusual names way outnumbered us in my school. I was always kinda jealous, I'll be honest. But I always knew my mom loved my name so much and I knew it would upset her if I tried changing my name. So I never used my nickname at home which was Jett.

A part of me always wished I could just go by Jett. But I decided not to rock the boat or upset my mom. But then a year ago my mom found out about the nickname and she berated me for using it and introducing myself to new people as Jett. She was such a dick about it and then she told me I should be grateful for her decision to give me a nice classic name because look at how ridiculous my two best friends sound with their first names and I told her I was jealous of them. She said they're really jealous of me and I was too young to see it. I told her she should try asking my best friends that because I know for a fact they love their names. Mom called me all kinds of names and told me she would never allow me to change my name anyway and she demanded I stop going by Jett.

It annoyed me so much and after a few weeks of thinking about the argument we had and looking at the reasons I kept William instead of changing it to Jett, I realized she really didn't deserve that consideration given her reaction to me having a nickname and her thinking she could make the decision for me. I was 19 at this point.

So I saved money and then I petitioned to change my legal first name to Jett. I kept my middle name the same but dropped William completely. It became official a few weeks ago and my mom was furious when all my new documents came in and she realized I hadn't lied and had officially gone through with the name change. She told me I had ruined my life and I had disrespected her by changing the name she gave me and she felt suited me best. I told her I never liked my name. She told me it should have grown on me because William is such a nice normal name.

She's still angry about it and I expected that but she really believes I'm in the wrong for going ahead with it.

118,1d70kle,WIBTA for calling my friend out for her bad life choice ,"I (28F) was in a predicament at my previous place of work. Almost a year ago, my friend, Jessie (28F), arranged a job for me in her city and place of work.

I wanted out and sounds like her work environment was better at the time.

I packed up and left my town to move to one of our country's capital cities.

Everything was fine and we got along well. We leased together and shared the rent.

But over time I realized that this working environment is even more toxic than my previous place. And I dislike the big city. I dislike the traffic and how crowded it is, I cannot stand the 30min commute to work if I live less than 10 km from work. It's ridiculous. 

Also, Jenny has a horrible track record with men. I saw her dating sporadically. In about 3 months she saw 3 different men. Not at the same time, it was just all over the place. She would go places with them, invite them over ect. She dumped all of them

But less than a month after the 3 month rampage, I heard she's suddenly in a committed long distance relationship with a man from another country. She said she found ""the one""...

Technically he's native to our country but he's working abroad and now she's moving there. She'll still be working for our company, but remotely. 

She decided to make the move after dating him for 5 months, which is waaay to early in my opinion. 

She let me know 3 months in advance that she'll be moving, so that I can find a new place or look for a roommate. But I'm still feeling extremely let down. I cannot stand this type of lifestyle.

I've also spoken to my family and some of our mutual friends and everyone thinks she's making a mistake uprooting her life for one person this early into a relationship. I don't understand how her family can allow her to do something like this.

This last month has been hell and I feel like it's just going to get worse. She's selling her furniture, strangers are coming into our home to pick it up, she constantly is out and almost never cleans the house. She keeps clean, yes. But she never cleans like she used to anymore (wiping off counter tops, mopping, sweeping ect)

When I ask her why she's out the whole time she'll say it's because she wants to make as many memories as possible. I think it's just an excuse to party and drink.

When I ask her about cleaning she tells  me that she keeps clean and will clean when things are dirty, but she won't spend an entire weekend spring cleaning anymore because ""she'd rather spend that time outside and with friends"".

Our lease ends in a month, and I don't think I can keep quiet much longer. I am 100 responsible for the house and chores and that's just not okay. On occasion she also forgot to lock the outside door and once she almost let my dog out.

I want to sit her down and just be honest with her, and tell her I think she's making a huge mistake. I also don't think this guy is worth it because I've heard their conversations and they tend to argue and bicker about the smallest things.

119,1d70jgh,WIBTA if I didn’t divide up the property with my half sisters? ,"I 24F grew up from a broken family. I lived with my mom and stepfather (they opt not to have any kids) and my dad lived with his new family and had 3 kids. I only met with my dad 1-2 times a year and the times I met my younger siblings can only be counted on one hand, so we never really had any relationship. Last year my dad suddenly passed away, the atmosphere was tense between family cause my dad’s side of the family hated my dad’s new “wife” and would argue on who should make the decisions. I had no choice but to be in the frontline as dad’s side would say i have the “legal right” to make the decisions since my mom and bio dad are still married. Regarding the properties, I decided not to fight for my share in the house, land and rentals that my dad owned majority due to the fact that my siblings are still small and I feel guilty having to take that away from them. Now, my life is not comfortable , I have my own debts and am living paycheck to paycheck but I am single and working so things are better. Fast forward to now, we found out that dad had a land on the province that he didn’t know, it was supposedly from my late grandma from dad’s side. It’s a 0.5 hectare of land , and my grandma’s sister is taking care of it for us. So here is where the i’m not sure on what to do, Grandma’s sister has been saying that it’s mine to take and whatnot and that I don’t have to divide it between my half siblings and me since I didn’t take my share from dad’s other properties in the city.

120,1d70i66,AITA for telling my aunt that finding my birth parents wouldn't make her bio son search for her?,"I'm (24f) an adoptee and I have never ever wanted to search for my birth parents or any birth family. I'm happy with the family I was raised in, I did some genetic testing to get a better idea of risk factors so I don't need my birth family for that kind of thing and generally I don't feel any curiosity about the people I'm genetically related to. I'm also really fucking happy with my life and I'm not feeling anything missing. Something could change in the future but I have never felt any other way about this.

My mom's oldest sister aka aunt from the title, placed her son for adoption 38 years ago. She was young and she felt like she had no choices at the time. But she has always wished she hadn't given him up, she tried to get him back a couple of months after he was adopted, and she tried searching for him a few times, but it seems like he never looked for her and so she hasn't found him. It's a grief she carries around almost 40 years later.

I think my aunt's experience has given her this warped idea that if I were to search for my birth family and show an interest in meeting and being part of my birth family, her son will do the same. She has encouraged me to be more curious about my birth family for years now. Since I was a teenager and I never cared. She told me, not asked or suggested, but told me I should look for my birth parents. I told her I didn't want to and she told me I didn't know what I was saying. She has used guilt trips about my birth parents missing me and about the family I could be missing out on. But I was clear I don't care. My mom spoke to her several times and told her to get help and stop dragging me into her grief. She refuses to leave it alone.

She has asked me why I have no interest and I have told her how I feel. She has really tried to make me say I'm somewhat curious but I'm just not. And then we had an incident the other week. She mentioned it for the millionth time and I tried to ignore her and carry on other conversations but she kept bringing it up, and bringing it up. She was asked to stop by my mom and other family members and finally I got so tired of her pressing the issue that I told her finding my birth parents won't make her son search for her and she needs to stop linking those things because she's setting herself up for more heartache.

121,1d6zron,AITA for what I (26F) said to my BF (28M) in front of his friends?,"A little background: We've been going out since high school, and have a very joke-y relationship, poking fun for the most part isn't out of the question, though if one of us says we aren't comfortable with one of the jokes the other makes an effort not to make it again- for the most part (more context coming).

I have been a bit of an obsessive fan of music artist since I was 14. I have more than one tattoo inspired by this artist and her aesthetic, I have seen her in concert multiple times, I own more merch than I can say, and have run several different fan accounts devoted to her during this time. I understand this is *weird*, I try not to bring it up in everyday conversation because I am aware- *it is weird.* Most people who know me in passing do not know this about me, and only my best friend and my boyfriend know about my fan accounts. I am not the person who talks about this artist constantly, I am not the person who is annoying in large groups about it, (*anymore*, there was a learning curve when I was in high school but losing friends is a great motivator to fix yourself).

My boyfriend has on and off made jokes about this since we got together. Admittedly, whenever I bring up that it makes me feel insecure and unsafe expressing myself around him, he stops for a while. But he always starts up again, and it just *bothers me.* I can't fully explain it, but it makes me feel like the things I like are somehow inherently bad, and that he wants me to stop having this interest because he doesn't see value in it. Now he's never said that, and I don't genuinely believe that, but that's how he makes me *feel.* An example: I had been cleaning dishes, and listening to her music when he came into the kitchen and started singing along in the most high-pitched, off-key falsetto voice I had ever heard, before busting up and turning it off and saying something like ""I don't see how you listen to this crap.""  This was one of the times I told him that he had hurt my feelings, he apologized, explained that he had only meant it as a lighthearted joke, and that he didn't care what kind of music I listened to. I don't really get mad over this, it more just hurts my feelings.

Context out of the way, we were out at dinner with his friends, and their girlfriends. and I had left to go to the bathroom, and came back to him showing them a video on his phone, and the audio was familiar right away. It was a performance from over a decade ago that was panned pretty universally. They were all laughing and he was making a lot of jokes, until he noticed I had gone quiet, and said to lighten up. I tried to smile, but he wouldn't drop it, and I said: ""I don't like your music either, but I would *never* make fun of you for it, you know that?"" 

It was a quiet meal, and ride home, and he is now barely talking to me. Two of the girlfriends there said I made everything awkward, and that I was being unfair because we always made jokes with each other.

A little background: We've been going out since high school, and have a very joke-y relationship, poking fun for the most part isn't out of the question, though if one of us says we aren't comfortable with one of the jokes the other makes an effort not to make it again- for the most part (more context coming).

I have been a bit of an obsessive fan of music artist since I was 14. I have more than one tattoo inspired by this artist and her aesthetic, I have seen her in concert multiple times, I own more merch than I can say, and have run several different fan accounts devoted to her during this time. I understand this is *weird*, I try not to bring it up in everyday conversation because I am aware- *it is weird.* Most people who know me in passing do not know this about me, and only my best friend and my boyfriend know about my fan accounts. I am not the person who talks about this artist constantly, I am not the person who is annoying in large groups about it, (*anymore*, there was a learning curve when I was in high school but losing friends is a great motivator to fix yourself).

My boyfriend has on and off made jokes about this since we got together. Admittedly, whenever I bring up that it makes me feel insecure and unsafe expressing myself around him, he stops for a while. But he always starts up again, and it just *bothers me.* I can't fully explain it, but it makes me feel like the things I like are somehow inherently bad, and that he wants me to stop having this interest because he doesn't see value in it. Now he's never said that, and I don't genuinely believe that, but that's how he makes me *feel.* An example: I had been cleaning dishes, and listening to her music when he came into the kitchen and started singing along in the most high-pitched, off-key falsetto voice I had ever heard, before busting up and turning it off and saying something like ""I don't see how you listen to this crap.""  This was one of the times I told him that he had hurt my feelings, he apologized, explained that he had only meant it as a lighthearted joke, and that he didn't care what kind of music I listened to. I don't really get mad over this, it more just hurts my feelings.

Context out of the way, we were out at dinner with his friends, and their girlfriends. and I had left to go to the bathroom, and came back to him showing them a video on his phone, and the audio was familiar right away. It was a performance from over a decade ago that was panned pretty universally. They were all laughing and he was making a lot of jokes, until he noticed I had gone quiet, and said to lighten up. I tried to smile, but he wouldn't drop it, and I said: ""I don't like your music either, but I would *never* make fun of you for it, you know that?"" 

It was a quiet meal, and ride home, and he is now barely talking to me. Two of the girlfriends there said I made everything awkward, and that I was being unfair because we always made jokes with each other. AITA?",0.0,0.060678236186504364,0,1

the first time i ever met him i was 14/15. that is when i met him and my stepmother, let's call her M. my father and i both are both bad at social interaction, so it was mostly my aunt and M getting us to talk to each other, which turned out great. M did not want to believe i was his child at first, and demanded a test, we did this test at the first meeting. when the results came back, M was practically inconsolable because she couldn't believe i could be his child. she thought my mom and i were only after child support, which is definitely hurtful.

she tried to be nice but ultimately failed, consistently making me uncomfortable by offering to take me away from my mother and force me into new territory which i didn’t like. she lied to me and my mother a lot. one thing that I heavily disliked was her recommending 13 reasons to me. i had gone through a similar experience, and it was highly inappropriate to mention to a minor.

she would make a lot more comments and push harder which eventually led me to stop contacting her all together. unfriending and blocking her from all my social media because i was a stressed child who didn't have time for her nonsense. i did not talk to her or my father for a long time.

fast forward to present year. in recent times as i have aged and matured, i have gotten more comfortable with being able to engage with my father. i have been able to meet with him and his side of the family, and they have accepted me like i was always there.

i have made plans for six of them including my dad to join me and my moms side of the family for my graduation, as it would mean a whole lot to me and them for them to be there for one of the biggest moments in my life. we have also planned on going out as a family the next day. M has caught wind of this and has since been texting me non stop asking my forgiveness and telling my father that she wants to be there as well. i have texted to both of them that i have no interest in having any kind of relationship with her or wanting her at any of my events.

123,1d6zc8r,AITA for telling my friends to give me gf a break?,"We're all 18. I want to be fair and say my friends aren't being judgmental out of nowhere.

My friends and I are really close, especially me and my best friend. My gf is part of our friend group and we all said we'd be friends forever. I really believe that will be the case, and I know it will be (at least for me and my best friend.)

They were thrilled when I started dating her, someone from our friend group. But right now, they're annoyed at her.

My gf is amazing and the nicest person at high school and in our friend group. But she has always been extremely rude to her parents.

She made a comment to her mom about how she was shocked anyone would date her (after the divorce and her mom dating someone else.) She also tells me how much she hates her mom, how she doesn't do enough for her, etc.

But I always figured there was more to the story. Maybe her mom was cruel to her growing up and that's why she acted like that. She's so nice to us, why would she turn around and be a dick to her mom?

My cousin has abusive parents and she told me that often when a kid hates a parent they assume it's because of a spoiled kid, but usually that behavior is caused by something. So I always believed that.

But it was my gf's birthday and her mom went to pick up her cousin for the plans we had. She called saying she fell and sprained her ankle and she was going to be late to pick us up. My gf lost her mind at this.

For the record, birthdays are huge for her and she planned the entire day out. She screamed at her mom, saying it was her birthday and calling her names. She called her a fatass that couldn't walk straight or do anything right.

I will say that if I talked to my mom like that... It's game over. But her mom just hung up on her. She was ranting and crying after that and I was trying to make her feel better.

But it turned into an argument because my bff told her that she shouldn't talk to her mom like that, that she was fucked up for doing that. It turned into a huge argument and now my bff thinks she's a shit person. I told him to give my gf a break, it's her birthday, and he doesn't know if her mom is normally shitty to her.

126,1d6ypun,AITA for breaking up with my abusive long distance girlfriend?,"I (20m) have been dating my long distance girlfriend (22f) for nine months now. We met on a dating app and hit it off very quickly. She is from another country and we decided that we would meet each other in real life near the summer time when college is slower for her and she will have more time.

I was excited to meet her, I was madly in love with her and when I saw her in real life for the first time in the airport I fell in love with her all over again. Everything was great for the first few days of being with her. But we had a disagreement about something i thought was small and she blew up on me. She screamed, nearly broke a wine bottle, and she even put a knife to her wrist. It scared the crap out of me.

She has attempted suicide before in the past and I helped her through it but seeing it in real life scared me. I started rethinking so many things about our relationship. I stayed up one night during my stay just contemplating everything and I was so shocked. It was like something in my head clicked off in that moment and every red flag that I ignored for nine months came rushing back to my memory.

I wrote down a very long list of things that she did regularly that I didn't agree with but somehow overlooked because I was worried for her safety. And I mean it was a long list of things. The reason I overlooked these things and did not communicate with her was because I was afraid she would hurt herself as she has done in the past. 

The rest of my visit I suffered in silence as I contemplated my future with this girl over and over again. While I was suffering in silence, she was having a blast. It was like we were together but I wasn't being seen. Maybe I was very good at hiding how I truly felt. I'm not sure.

Fast forward to my last day there on my visit, she found the list of my frustrations and she flipped out on me. She started screaming at me and crying for over half an hour. And what really shocked me was that she even physically assaulted me. She hit me, bit me, pulled my hair, shook me, and blocked my movements so I couldn't move to where I wanted to be. I never saw this side of her before. In that moment, I made my mind up, I needed to be done with her.

Then afterwards, she cried softly and we talked about things and she admitted her wrong doing. She said she wanted to change and be better. I still loved her... I still love her as I am writing this post. And she was able to convince me to stay with her. As I got on the plane and traveled back home, it was almost like she became a different person. She changed back into the woman I fell in love with. She became perfect again and she could do no wrong. But just a day ago she did those things...

I thought to myself, she wants to change... And I want her to change. But can she really change? She changed personalities like flipping a switch. What if she changes and I think she is better but she is just pretending? I lost trust in her and I told her over video call that we were over. It went as well as you can imagine. She cried so much and begged me to give her another chance and to stay. Her words made me feel so guilty for leaving her. I am literally heart broken right now.

I know I made the right choice for my future but I feel like a total asshole. I have had girls break things off with me... But this was the first time I ever broke things off with a girl.

She recently broke up with her long time boyfriend. 

I’ve been dating Leah (29F) for about 4 months, however we’ve known each other and been friends since high school. She ended a long abusive relationship last year and reached out to me, we’ve been inseparable ever since and started dating 5 months after her breakup. It’s been the best relationship I’ve ever been in. 

I introduced Helen and Leah before we started dating, they got along just fine, we went out together with other friends several times and they seemed to like each other, everything looked good until Leah and I started dating, ever since Helen has seemingly stopped liking her, she stopped going out with our group of friends and started acting increasingly weird with me, she started gossiping about my relationship with other people and ultimately stopped talking to me altogether with no further explanation. 

I managed to get Helen to talk to me after 3 months, she said that I had started dating Leah too quickly after her breakup and that she believes that Leah “doesn’t deserve me”, she also said that her own breakup had really affected her and that she was not comfortable hanging around other couples at the moment, we fixed some things and cleared up many misunderstandings and decided to try and fix the friendship, however she said that she wasn’t ready to see Leah again but would make sure to “work on this” and she was sure she’d come around since she actually liked Leah before we started dating, I accepted this. 

It’s been a month and Helen is celebrating her 30th birthday next week, she wants to have dinner and then go camping to a nearby lake for the weekend, she has invited other friends and couples, however Leah isn’t invited. 

Leah told me that she doesn’t want me to choose, however she does want to feel respected and prioritized and right now she feels as if I’m disrespecting our relationship, she is hurt by Helen not inviting her to a group plan and by me for not standing up to her and choosing to go even when she’s not at least considered.

I’m now considering telling Helen that I can’t go if Leah is not at least invited, however I’m afraid that I’m TA since it’s her birthday and she’s been having a really rough year.

128,1d6ybud,AITA girlfriend wants to know about dandruff while I am on the toilet,"This morning my girlfriend  began a socially stressful ""founders week"" at work. She doesn't fit in at work, they are finance and she's a designer so she doesn't dress or act ""right"" by their standards according to her.

Today was my day off, so I wake up and let her get ready and go before I to the toilet. She walks back into the apartment after leaving, Knocks on the bathroom door and asks if she can ask me something (has the eagle landed) I say yes, thinking it will be a quick thing.she comes in and asks how bad her dandruff is. I tell her it's noticeable, she asks how does she hide it, can she brush it? I say no she might make it worse, she then starts brushing her hair in front of the mirror while I'm sitting on the toilet desperate to drop.

She comes back and asks me to point out where the problem areas are. I get up pull up my pants in a huff, the urge has left, and stand up to help her. She storms out saying no it's fine you don't have to help me, and you don't have to be so mean.

I just want to take a shit.

Also, I would be paying for most of her half of the trip if she were to join. My sister was confused by my mom's suggestion as she hasn't expressed a desire to join as ive been telling her my plans.

130,1d6xygn,AITA for refusing to help my friends sick kid? ,"Posting this on a throwaway account because she follows my normal reddit account. I, F(20) and my friend F(24) are currently not on speaking terms. I will call her Emily for the sake of this post. 
Me and Emily became close friends in highschool 5-6 years ago, and at the age of 18, she had gotten pregnant. 

I want to make it clear, I absolutely do not judge her for this, and I supported her decision to keep the baby. She went through with it and she now has a young boy who is 6 years old. I have always been there to support her, helping her with money and emotional support, however I always distanced myself with the kid. 

Her husband, the father of the child, took responsibility and they are engaged. Which I think is great, so it's not like she is dealing with raising a kid alone. 

So back to around a week ago, she had been talking to me over the phone explaining that her kid had gotten sick with the flu. He was throwing up and having a rough time, but she had a meeting and her husband was working, so she asked me to stay home with him, as she didn't want to find a sitter and have to pay. 

I know that any normal person would absolutely take care of it for their friend, and take care of the kid, however, 3 main things caused me to refuse to help. 

1: have a strong dislike of kids, and kids don't like me. That's fine. Me and the little dude are on good terms. He's fine. But I sure don't know how to care for him properly. 
2: Am a germaphobe, and have been most of my life. I can't stand germs. My friend has known this about me and has always respected this. 
3: I have a weak immune system (which is what caused the germaphobia) and can get seriously knocked out when it comes to getting sick. To the point I almost never go out without gloves and a mask and hand sanitizer.

So I told her I couldn't help, and she immediately got very angry at me and it exploded into a large fight. Now she won't talk with me and I don't know what to do. I feel bad but I really really don't think I could have handled taking care of her kid.

We’ve been living together for about two years, and we generally get along really well. Recently, R’s boyfriend, M (26M), lost his job and was evicted from his apartment. R asked if he could move in with us temporarily until he got back on his feet.

I feel for M and understand that he’s going through a tough time, but I’m uncomfortable with the idea of him moving in. M and I don’t get along very well. He has always been short and cold with me for reasons I cannot fathom. Once, R and I were having lunch at a cafe and M joined us. He constantly made snide remarks regarding my meal like ""Surely, you don't need to eat THAT much"" or ""If you were my girl, I would never let you indulge in that many carbs."" It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable for me. But R said nothing and M laughed, trying to pass them off as jokes. I really don't know what his problem with me is. 

I told R that I wasn’t okay with M moving in, and she got really upset. She argued that as her boyfriend, he’s practically family and needs our help. She assured me it would only be for a couple of months, but I’m skeptical about the timeline. I suggested that M stay with his family or another friend, but R said he doesn’t have other options.

Now, R is giving me the cold shoulder, and some of our mutual friends are saying I’m being unreasonable and selfish. They think I should help out in a tough situation, especially since it’s temporary.

Every relationship has its up and downs, and so has ours. We have mostly been able to sail through them. But there's an issue of hers that bothers me way too much and I just don't know what to do about it.

She is incredibly forgetful and a little careless. She agrees that it's an issue and has made a lot of improvements over the years, but this has been going on for a decade now. I am trying my best to ignore these issues because they set me off, but I fail at times. It leads to some argument and with both of us regretting the fight. Mostly they are small issues with some mistakes having a massive impact later on, like when she lost my music player that was a gift from a close friend. I guess it sounds quite petty but I have been dealing with it for so long that it's tiring now.

Today's incident is what's making me write this post. She got some groceries last night and kept them in the fridge but forgot the ice cream in her bag. I noticed it today morning and told her, in the most polite way possible that she forgot. She accepted it and we moved past it.

136,1d6wzho,AITA for waiting until the end of the day?,"I live with roommates. They are a couple. In the past, one of them has claimed that the other two people in the house ( their partner and myself) do not help clean as much as they do. The general areas are kitchen, dining room, and living room.  To combat these arguments we have come up with a schedule of who
Cleans what on any given day. For example, kitchen duty is dishes/dishwasher, pick up and wipe down counters. However on Sundays, we deep clean the house. 

Recently one of my roommates had a work schedule change and their Friday is on Sunday meaning they’ve still worked while their partner and I had two days off. 

Usually on my kitchen days, I tend to wait until the end of the day when the everyone is done with the kitchen to clean up so the kitchen is completely clean overnight . However, we also meal prep all day so sometimes I do multiple rounds of dishes. 

Today, before I woke up my roommate who has the same days off as I do, had picked up and cleaned up while I was asleep . This gave me the chance to study for an exam tonight and focus on my areas that I have put off such as my room and bathroom. However As the day went by the dishes went from none to a good amount but nothing crazy. 

It is now 10pm and my roommate who always says we (but in this case I ) never help got mad at me for waiting this long to do the dishes and became even more upset when she pointed out that her partner was already doing them even though he worked today and I was home for most of the day. I immediately told their partner they don’t have to do them Because I was planning on cleaning up however they said it’s okay. I went back to my roommate who was upset explained that I was on the phone a little longer than I expected and I was sorry. I planned to do the dishes earlier but I got sidetracked and that historically I do them at this time anyways AND I will do their partners kitchen duty as well next time to make up for it. They then stated that “no one wants to be in a dirty kitchen all day”. 

I was thoroughly thrown off by this because the kitchen was cleaned up by them the night prior on their kitchen duty day and that morning. The only difference was the slow pile up of dishes throughout the day that I created by meal prepping food for us. Additionally, we barely used the kitchen this weekend and was severely y deep cleaned the weekend prior so it wasn’t THAT BAD (in my opinion and I made that very clear that it was in my opinion ). Once again I apologized, stated that I just figured IMO if the kitchen is clean at the end of the night then what does it matter however I will compromise and said I will do them earlier moving forward BUT they are still upset at me and are making me feel like a bad roommate. 

So AITA for waiting this late to do my kitchen duty?

Usually on my kitchen days, I tend to wait until the end of the day when the everyone is done with the kitchen to clean up so the kitchen is completely clean overnight . However, we also meal prep all day so sometimes I do multiple rounds of dishes. 

Today, before I woke up my roommate who has the same days off as I do, had picked up and cleaned up while I was asleep . This gave me the chance to study for an exam tonight and focus on my areas that I have put off such as my room and bathroom. However As the day went by the dishes went from none to a good amount but nothing crazy. 

It is now 10pm and my roommate who always says we (but in this case I ) never help got mad at me for waiting this long to do the dishes and became even more upset when she pointed out that her partner was already doing them even though he worked today and I was home for most of the day. I immediately told their partner they don’t have to do them Because I was planning on cleaning up however they said it’s okay. I went back to my roommate who was upset explained that I was on the phone a little longer than I expected and I was sorry. I planned to do the dishes earlier but I got sidetracked and that historically I do them at this time anyways AND I will do their partners kitchen duty as well next time to make up for it. They then stated that “no one wants to be in a dirty kitchen all day”. 

I was thoroughly thrown off by this because the kitchen was cleaned up by them the night prior on their kitchen duty day and that morning. The only difference was the slow pile up of dishes throughout the day that I created by meal prepping food for us. Additionally, we barely used the kitchen this weekend and was severely y deep cleaned the weekend prior so it wasn’t THAT BAD (in my opinion and I made that very clear that it was in my opinion ). Once again I apologized, stated that I just figured IMO if the kitchen is clean at the end of the night then what does it matter however I will compromise and said I will do them earlier moving forward BUT they are still upset at me and are making me feel like a bad roommate. 

So AITA for waiting this late to do my kitchen duty?

137,1d6wyf1,WIBTA if I return my heirloom engagement ring?,"Okay! Nervous to post but ready for some honest answers and advice.

My now-husband proposed to me with his grandmother’s engagement ring at the end of 2015. We were young and hadn’t really ever talked about engagement rings, but nevertheless I loved the ring and felt honoured by the sentiment that came along with it. At the time, I had a good relationship with my husband’s grandmother and that maternal side of the family, and everyone was happy.

Despite loving the ring and wearing it without question, I always had a strong underlying feeling that the ring never truly felt like it was “mine”. It was always referred to by everyone as “grandma’s engagement ring” even after it was given to me, and  so I felt a significant responsibility to do right by the ring and by the family - it never felt easy to wear, and it never felt like it belonged on my hand, but I continued to push on with wearing it, hoping that one day it would feel like I was truly the owner.

Flash forward to late 2019, and we got married and had a beautiful wedding. There were some dramas that caused tension about who we were/weren’t inviting to our wedding (aren’t there always?), and in particular my mother-in-law and her mother (original owner of the engagement ring) weren’t overly pleased with us, but were both in attendance.

Flash forward again to May 2023, and my husband had a big falling out with his mother over other long-term but unrelated family issues, her manipulative and emotionally abusive behaviour, and her poor treatment of my husband. They have not spoken since, nor has any of that side of the family made any contact with us whatsoever, including his grandmother.

I have now found myself in a difficult position, wearing an engagement ring inherited from a family member that no longer engages in a relationship with us. The entire maternal side of the family have essentially iced us out, and I have very strong feelings of unhappiness and anger at the way they’ve treated my husband, and us as a couple.

It reached boiling point at the beginning of this year, due to several nasty things said/done to my husband by family members, one of which being his grandmother. I decided that for my own mental health I needed a break from wearing the ring and looking at it every day. It is now kept in a safe location away from our house, and I feel such a weight off my shoulders not having it with me every day. I’m now at the point where I can’t see myself wearing it again - the feelings I get from that ring are anything but happy unfortunately, which is not what I had dreamed of for myself re: my engagement ring, and my husband feels the same. He is supportive of me not wearing it, and wants to prioritise my happiness over all else.

Since last year, we have had about 1200 euros of cash savings. My partner has been running short on money for a while now, and I have been transferring him extra money on top of rent money that he can spend. The cash savings means a lot to me and he knows this. It symbolizes a fun trip together eventually, and more. The cash savings come from a collection of coins that we saved up randomly, and went to a bank with. I have much more than this in my savings (which is about 45k€), and he has no savings.

Not sure if it's relevant, but I contributed more to the savings than he did. I would say that it's about 60-70% of my money.

As said earlier, he has been financially struggling for a few months now. I will occasionally check the cash savings, and recently noticed that some 50€ notes started disappearing. I then took the cash, and hid it. He later texted me, and brought it up this weekend. He was upset, called me an asshole, and said that it hurt him that I did not trust him with the money, and that he would pay it back, etc.

He compared to me having hidden the cash to my ex throwing away my revealing clothes and having abused me. I recognize that what I did was financially controlling, but this money meant a lot to me. It hurts me that now, there is about 500€ left.

As stated, he said he will pay back. But everytime that I have given him money, he has not. I feel like a jerk, as I know he needed the money, and I would have given it to him had he only asked, but he never did. I know I have a lot of money and should not be worried, but thinking about having to save up for a holiday again hurts, as I am quite sure he will not replace the money. I should probably also mention that he has a history of impulsive purchases and alcohol use.

I ultimately had to evict him and have a Deputy come physically remove him from the property. He had found a marginal living situation but did not pay the rent for several months and so was evicted from there also. Now he lives in his car, which he also uses to drive for rideshares, his only income.

We have maintained contact because I am one of the only people in his life who will help him (helping people who are in great need is ingrained in my psyche), and he has asked me if I will allow him to stay in my guest room during the day so he has a place to sleep that is air conditioned (we live where it is already in the 90s and very humid). He says he won't move any of his things in and that he will both pay me and help me fix some things in the house that are broken (all of which he broke when he lived there).  I could use both the money and the assistance, but he has proven unreliable multiple times in the past as far as paying and assisting.  Based on past experience, he will also eat all my food and keep the house at 65 degrees all day, which will drive my electricity bill sky high.

It's a tempting offer but I just don't want him back here again; he still thinks we can get back together so I suspect that is part of his motive also.

We have only been dating for like two months but I know him well because his oldest sister is my best friend since high school. He has a barely 2 year old daughter. I think it’s important to say that Hiro is not really the dating type, but after some pushing he agreed to go out with me and we’ve been seeing each other since. He’s very much addicted to his job and his daughter, so we really only text a little and see each other like maybe once a week, I’m sure things will pick up as we grow closer though.

Anyway, yesterday the whole family was at his sister’s house for food and swimming. He was swimming with the baby and it was really cute, his mom was taking pictures and I started to record a video. The video was super cute so I sent it to him, his parents, and his brother and sisters. I also posted it on my TikTok and Instagram just because it was truly adorable.

This morning when I woke up it had a couple hundred likes on TikTok. He’s hot, his baby is absolutely adorable, and it was a cute video so people liked it. I shared the link with him and he flew off the handle, making me delete the video. I told him I didn’t understand the big deal, and he told me that he just wasn’t comfortable with videos of his baby on the internet. We argued via text about this and now he’s just not responding.

Some of his family is defending him, my best friend is defending him but saying he’s being kind of whiny about it. Other friends have told me he overreacted and I feel that way too. I really just thought it was a cute video. It’s just privated right now but I will delete it if it’s really a problem.",Asshole,2024-06-03,"AITA for posting a video of my boyfriend’s daughter? Hi! I (32F) am dating Hiro (27M). We have only been dating for like two months but I know him well because his oldest sister is my best friend since high school. He has a barely 2 year old daughter. I think it’s important to say that Hiro is not really the dating type, but after some pushing he agreed to go out with me and we’ve been seeing each other since. He’s very much addicted to his job and his daughter, so we really only text a little and see each other like maybe once a week, I’m sure things will pick up as we grow closer though.

146,1d6vr6s,AITA for yelling at my sisters boyfriend and calling his a liar,"So I (25F) and my sister's boyfriend (30M) have a very strained relationship. Some background, he's a gambling addict, a gaslighter, never shows a sliver of love towards my sister or their child (that he wanted her to abort), steals money from family and friends to fund his gambling addiction and has never admitted he's a chronic gambler despite everyone knowing he is. Obviously, I know this sounds bad and I'm making him out to be the worst person in the world, well that's because he is.  

So some background to the events leading up to the AITA, they were staying at his mum's house until she decided to sell it and they had 2 months to find a new place to live. well, they didn't and decided to just live with the mum a few hours away. so they had to find new jobs in said place but in the weeks leading up to them moving out of the house, they still hadn't found jobs or left their previous jobs. Now a bit more backstory, they had lived at my parents rent-free for 2 years and didn't save a single dollar and treated my parents and the house like shit, hence why they moved into his mum's in the first place. So my parents didn't want them living back with them, so when they weren't finding new jobs we all knew that they would claim they needed more time to figure things out and needed to stay with my parents. Well, you guessed it they claimed that they needed 6 weeks in my parent's house because thats how long he needed to put in his notice to leave his job for. If you have ever left a job before you would know its usually 2 maybe 4 weeks to put in your notice. So they are already lying and trying to extend their stay. So throughout the weeks they were staying at my parent's house I kept asking if he had put in his 6 weeks notice yet, he kept saying no/avoiding the question, and saying shit like he was both leaving and not leaving the job in the same fucking sentence. 

Anyway, we get to the bit where I might be the asshole. 4 weeks after they have moved in and with only 2 weeks left before they have to leave I ask him again if he had put in his 6 weeks' notice and what the hell he was going to do, and this motherfucker says ""I never said 6 weeks it has always been 2, you must not have understood me, you are getting confused"" I was livid, ill be dammed if I let vermin try to gaslight me. So this is where AITA I raised my voice and just said so you're a fucking liar then, this is who you are and he tried to act all innocent and say that he's not a liar, so I walked out and yelled at my sister that I won't be talking to that liar anymore. I don't want my sister to think I won't be there for her when she finally realised what a sack of shit he is so I wonder if I could have gone about this a different way.

149,1d6v16r,AITA for yelling at my mom when she talked about my grades,"I have worked my ass off my entire schooling to keep my 4.0 GPA. This semester (junior year) was a bit more tough and I will admit I should have tried harder on the midterms, but essentially maintaining my GPA comes down to my final exam grades in 3 classes. My mom has always been ""hands off"" and never really asked me about my grades, it has been my own initiative. She always says she doesn't care where I go to college, do my own thing, etc. Now all of a sudden as the school year is almost ending and I still have ONE B... she is saying I will not get into ANY colleges, I will have to go to some podunk school and I squandered my whole life's work because I was lazy. This has been going on for about 3 weeks and every few days she asks me when my B is going back up to an A. I told her just wait for the report card. This keeps happening and my answer doesn't change, I just need to wait for my final exam grade. Finally today she said ""But it says here your GPA is still 4.0"" and I snapped, called her an idiot and said she doesn't understand anything about the system and should just shut up. I know it was rude and I shouldn't talk like that. It's just that your GPA only changes after the report card is out!!! It's like she can't comprehend that! Also I am pissed that she was always talking about how she's so hands off and lets me do my thing, now when my grades are less than perfect, the whole atmosphere at home has changed 180

EDIT: she is also mad at me because I refused to take $150 per hour tutoring cause I genuinely didn't think I needed it. My reasoning was most of the people with an A in the class don't take tutoring so why should I...

I don’t know much about this girl but I do know I don’t want anybody in the apartment right now as it’s a mess from baby stuff and I’m too pregnant to wanna worry about strangers being here.

153,1d6u8w4,AITA for asking to have a room at my family’s house (18m),"
I’m 18m and I’m from an Asian family that is high middle class. For context, I have twin siblings (20m brother, 20f sister), and the eldest sister (26f). I also have a narcissistic dad and an enabler mom so please keep that in mind when I’m growing up without a room. I am also aware people have it worse than me, but I’m focused on my situation.

When we moved into our current house 7-8 years ago, there are 5 rooms where my parents shared a room and there is enough rooms for every sibling and I. However, my mom wanted me and my brother to share a room while my two sisters have separate rooms. My mom is very religious and into Buddhism and had an altar for Buddha in a designated room. She wanted the same for the current house we lived at.

When I was still young and shared a room with my brother, naturally I wanted independence so I decided to sleep on the couch and have all of my stuff there, age 7 - age 18. Overtime having no room to escape in or having privacy really made me feel envious of others and I do feel like as the youngest and being sheltered with undiagnosed ADHD, growing up without a room fucked me up mentally and still continues to this day.

Recently I asked my mom I wanted a room and I asked her if she could happen to place the altar somewhere else because other people tend to do that in the same religion. My mom blew up at me and said that it’s disrespectful. I’m aware that placing an altar in a room is the highest form of respect for some people but to not think about me being in an environment where I’m most best to grow independently especially when we have a extra room, she would prioritize having a room for the altar rather than place it somewhere else. My eldest sister says I’m entitled and spoiled but I don’t think I’m not when having no privacy or a space to grow in fucked me a lot. She says she thinks having a room for the altar over me was a good choice.

AITA? I’m not sure if I’m she’s right or not.

TLDR: I have no room for my entire life, mom and eldest sister finds it disrespectful to place it somewhere else in the house and rather keep it in a room where it could be a space for me to live in and have privacy to grow and be independent especially being sheltered.

154,1d6u6l8,WIBTA if I told my ex my life isn’t all that bad since she left?,"So I(20m) and my ex fiancé (20f) broke up roughly a month ago it was fully her decision I was caught completely off guard with her telling me that she’s leaving. Since she left I was a mess for the first two weeks, I couldn’t imagine life without her (we were together for almost 4 years). The day she told me she packed up everything and moved out of my house and took one of our dogs with her. Since then I’ve found it a lot easier to do chores and take care of the house, whereas before she did a large portion of the household work since I work a lot. She’s been going out and partying and seems to be enjoying her newly found freedom, hanging out with the people she hated for our entire relationship. 
The point of this post is, I’ve since been trying to sell the house that I bought for us and decided to move closer to my family. I have gotten better job offers and have been a lot more comfortable at my house by myself, besides the occasional wave of missing her and feeling lonely. She only gets in contact when she needs something and I really want to tell her that I have been doing well without her. But every time we text I feel like my healing has to start all over again. I do still want her at times but I don’t think I’m wrong to not want to talk to her 
Also in the beginning i offered her help to make sure her and my dog were okay she still had one of my credit cards till recently. She was financially dependent on me in our relationship I wasn’t going to just drop her and let her struggle 

So WIBTA if next time she reach’s out for something I tell her no and tell her I’m doing good and I don’t want to keep getting my feelings dragged back into her?
