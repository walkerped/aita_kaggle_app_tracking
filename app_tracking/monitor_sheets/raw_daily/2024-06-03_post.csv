0,1d76hon,AITA For sticking up for my friend?,"I (16F) am in high school as a sophomore. My friend, let’s call him Alex, is 16M, and he is trans from girl to guy. Me and him have been best friends for a good 11-12 years, so i’ve supported him no matter what. I will be honest, he does get into a lot of drama and argues with some people but besides that he is a pretty chill guy. So on Friday i walked out of my fifth hour to go get a snack from the vending machines. I walk past these two girls who have a history of being AH’s. I walk past them and they are saying how he isn’t a real boy and how he is stupid and how he gets on their nerves. Which okay, he gets on your nerves, i get that but what’s the point in being a transphobic person because he is getting on your nerves?? Makes no sense. But i get my snack and im walking back to my class and i pass then again and they are still talking about it, so at this point, i just give them a dirty look and move on with my day, except for the fact, one of the girls decided to say “Wow did you see the dirty look that B**** gave us??” So thats when i turn around and start yelling at both of them, mainly this one girl, let’s call her Brooklyn, she is not the nicest girl so im just going off on her saying shut up and why does him being trans have anything to do with her and all of that. The problem is when i get angry i cry, so when i feel the tears coming i walk away and k see my teacher walking towards us. She stops near me and asks me what happened and i explain to her the whole thing. Me and her take a lap around the school (our school is kind of a square shape), and i calm down and go back to class. She talks to the girls and informs the assistant principal. My mom said im not in trouble but im scared im going to be just for sticking up for my friend, AITA??

1,1d70nee,UPDATE: AITA for rejecting the worst name ever for our offspring?,"First, the good news: We have a beautiful, healthy baby girl! She weighed in at 7 lbs 4 oz and already has the most incredible head of dark hair (seriously, where did that come from?). Labor was a marathon, not a sprint — 18 hours of “fun” — but the amazing nurses kept me fueled up on ice chips and cheesy encouragement.

Now, for the not-so-good news: The name situation. Buckle up, because this might take a minute.

Right before pushing started, things got a little heated between me and Stuart. Apparently, the stress of contractions made him even more attached to “Stuarta.” He was pacing the room, muttering about “family legacy” while I was doing some very impressive Lamaze breathing exercises.

Suddenly, my water broke with a rather impressive *pop*. Let’s just say it startled everyone in the room, including Stuart. The nurse, bless her heart, took advantage of the distraction and very calmly started prepping for delivery.

Everything after that was a blur of pushing, encouraging words, and the most amazing head of dark hair emerging into the world. The second our daughter was out, screaming her little lungs out, a wave of pure, primal love washed over me.

It was in that moment, staring at this tiny, perfect human being, that the name debate completely evaporated. There was no way I could call this beautiful little girl “Stuarta.”

So, what did we end up with?

In the haze of post-partum bliss, I blurted out the first name that popped into my head — the name of the incredible nurse who’d coached me through labor: Ella.

Yes, Ella. Not exactly the most adventurous choice, but in that moment, it felt perfect. Strong, steady, kind — just like the woman who’d helped bring our daughter into the world.

Stuart, bless his confused heart, just looked at me, then at our daughter, then back at me again. Finally, he let out a shaky laugh and said, “Ella it is.”

Thanks for all the support and hilarious “Stuarta” comparisons.

2,1d6xrc5,AITA for wanting input on my girlfriend's future wedding dress?,"My girlfriend, Cindy, (AFAB-NB23) and I (27M) are not yet engaged, getting married, etc. but somehow it seems as if the matter of wedding dresses has become a major issue between us. We have very different styles in general—I’m more minimalist, they’re more eclectic—and that difference goes into wedding dresses. They prefer dresses with lots of ruffles, a long train, just generally a more classic wedding style. I prefer more simplistic dresses, but I’m willing to compromise.

We’ve looked at dresses together in the past, and every time we’ve been able to agree on certain dresses that we both like. Even so, every time I’ve absolutely hated their favorite dresses, and they’ve absolutely hated my favorite dresses. At first, I didn’t think it would be an issue, because we had some middle ground, but when I made it clear that I wanted to have at least some amount of input, my partner was extremely upset, even angry. Since I know choosing the dress is typically something of an event for the bride and maids of honor, I told them I just wanted a picture of the dress itself, not to actually come along if that was the issue.

However, Cindy made it very clear that I don’t get an opinion on the dress. Since it’s a once in a lifetime event, according to them, they get full license to choose the dress, and I have no say in it. I clarified, I don’t want to choose the dress, just have some input. While I want Cindy to feel beautiful, I want both of us to like the way the other looks. Still, even with that in mind, they made it clear that the dress is non-negotiable.

At the time, I basically said we would discuss it either in couples counseling or when the time comes to choose the dress. They grumbled about it, but we decided to drop the matter.

Now, we’re getting ready to move in together and just had a conversation about the future of our relationship. While there are definitely some issues that are going to be more difficult to navigate, they mentioned that I have some particular preferences that could be an issue. When I asked what, Cindy brought up the wedding dress. I said, again, I’m willing to compromise and find something we both like, and Cindy said, again, that I don’t get to have an opinion. I just don’t.

Since there were bigger issues, I basically just dropped it and said we could discuss it once we sort the rest out. We’ve both agreed that we want to get couples therapy in the future, so I hope that will help.

Now, I recognize that there are other parts to this, like seeing the bride in the dress being bad luck and the general ritual of the bride and bridesmaids and all. But am I the asshole for wanting input on my girlfriend’s future wedding dress? Is there something I’m missing?



Update: Thank you to those of you who commented. I think I was in a mindset of being involved 50/50 without realizing how much of a controlling asshole that made me. I'll talk with Cindy later, apologize, and see how we can work on things moving forward. To those saying I should focus on my own clothes instead, any suggestions for how to match the general vibe? like cravat, tails, top hat? Go for a funky steampunk vibe? Genuinely, I'd love some suggestions.

Separately though since there was a bit of understandable confusion in the comments, while Cindy is NB, they currently prefer the term girlfriend, and while my other post might seem contradictory, I've since realized I'm queer as well. I specified they were AFAB because I didn't want people think I was trying to stop their gender expression, when it accidentally came off the exact opposite.

3,1d6vslo,UPDATE: AITA for not allowing my fiancés BF come to our wedding? ,"Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ph0ln6I44a

Original BLUF: I told my fiancé his best friend can’t come to our wedding. She pretends I don’t exist & he does nothing to address it. 

The comments on my original post opened my eyes and made me realize that despite this being the healthiest relationship I’ve been in, it doesn’t mean it’s actually healthy. We’ve had a couple conversations surrounding this issue, which mostly consisted of me saying it bothered me & him saying he I was the only one who cared. 

A couple things helped me realize my breaking point-

1. I asked him if he would be okay with our daughters future partner treating them like this, to which he got flustered, shut down, and said he didn’t want to talk about it. (I left it alone) 

2. He said he didn’t want to end his friendship or do anything to jeopardize it because “what if we break up.” This made me realize he would not protect me as his wife, since he didn’t as his girlfriend. 

The final straw was when I expressed how much it bothered me that he wanted me to blow this off since we, as in me & the best friend, only see each other 4-6 times a year & he said (directly quoted because this is burned into my brain) : “I know the way she treats you is garbage, but you’re allowing one person to dictate our relationship.” 

“It could be worse. She could be more active. There are worse ways to meddle, people text and lie, and all that to break relationships up.”

The first line broke my heart and told me all I needed to know. I have to truck through a couple more months of pre-planned & paid for  social engagements, but I closed the curtain on any chance of healing this relationship the moment those words left his mouth. 

Thank you everyone for the advice, common sense, knocking me upside my head, and similar related experiences & outcomes. 

I’m gonna go to therapy & redefine what a healthy, balanced, and communicative relationship. 

EDIT: the preplanned events aren’t the wedding/ engagement related. We share a home, need to divide assets, pets, a custody schedule. Additionally we have vacations, planned with a mutually shared friend group (bf not part of that group). I appreciate the concerns but I need to plan things out a little more. There will be no second chance. 

To those that keep saying they’re fucking- probably . When I first brought this up, he became stressed & kept emphasizing how I thought he was fuckin his best friend, and didn’t address the issue that was brought up. I don’t care to know or confirm. 

EDIT 2: We are NOT getting married, continuing our relationship. For those thinking I’m using the preplanned events to justify holding out good- absolutely f*ckin not. Our relationship was dead the moment he admitted she treated my like garbage, and basically shrugged it off. 

As a note- I NEVER asked him to cut anyone off, out of his life. I simply asked for basic greetings & acknowledgment during the rare encounters with his BFF.  This hasn’t happened, aside from a couple of begrudging times

4,1d6uovn,UPDATE: AITA For Telling My Sister That She Shouldn't Overvalue Herself And Prepare For The Worse?,"Hey!

It's been a couple of weeks and due to people still occasionally asking I thought I'd give a people some quick updates to the situation. Here are the basic bullet points:

* My sister has now been officially diagnosed with Postpartum Depression and that is the trump card/Hail Mary of the situation.
* My sister and her husband are living together again and in couple's therapy.
* My sister is in individual counseling.
* My niece has now been officially introduced to a few members of her paternal size and they all love her.
* Jack's family have ceased their negative comments about my sister but she says that they're still pretty formal and distant towards her. I honestly don't know if she'll ever be in their good graces again and will only put up with her for my BIL and niece's sake.
* My niece's name first and middle is going to be legally changed to whatever Jack wants.
* For the next five years BIL's side of the family is getting priority when it comes to any and all holidays.
* My mom will be on a strict info diet when it comes to the baby. No pictures unless Jack approves.

This is all I know for right now and my mom is NOT happy with any of this and is calling Jack a controlling AH but my sister is holding firm in an effort to save her marriage. She claims that BIL and her are making progress in counseling and I hope for her sake that it's true. It's gonna suck not being able to see my niece as much as I wanted for the next possible few years but compared to never being able to see her at all (like Jack's mom) it is what it is.

We told her that the payments and car insurance were her responsibility, but she was over the moon. We were leasing the car before she took it over, and she wanted to change it to where she owns the car when it pays off. We explained to her that she wasn’t allowed to change her mind later if she didn’t want it anymore, but she was adamant that she loved this car and wanted to keep it. So we went to the dealership and got all the paperwork in order, with both of our names on the car. 
 
Now that a few years have passed and she’s moved out, she’s been complaining that the car is too expensive and she’s struggling to afford to keep it. She suggested that she sell it, as the car is in good condition and she would probably get more than she owed, with some leftover to still get a cheaper car. 
 
We explained to her that this was not a possibility. My husband's business has been struggling lately, and talks of layoffs have been discussed.

We told her we could take it back and assume the rest of the payments, but that answer wasn’t good enough for her.

6,1d6tta1,AITA for backing out of my friend’s wedding?,"My friend (32m) had vented to me numerous times about his fiancé (32f) to the point where he admitted he wasn’t happy and was on the fence about calling off the wedding. I (30m) have only known my friend for two years and has done nothing but vent about work, wedding planning and his relationship. Frankly, I feel as if there’s no other connection past that and I am his only friend in the city. 

I was affected by my parents’ imperfect relationship, so now I have this thing where I stand on healthy relationships leading up to marriage. My friend would go on rants about trivial instances in the relationship, which all circles back to his fiancé’s lack of communication skills. 

Now, he’s begging his fiance to attend couple’s counseling before marriage only to be pushed back and told that they shouldn’t be married if there’s anything wrong with the relationship. It’s a tough position to be in.

As a result, he’s recently reached a tipping point crying for help telling me that he will cancel the wedding if his fiancé doesn’t succumb to his wishes——I suggested serving an ultimatum. I ultimately lost respect when he uttered “maybe she’ll die shortly after I put a ring on it so I can start all over” in a fit of rage. 

He is still going to follow through because the money has already been spent halfway through the budget and he doesn’t want to be judged for calling off the wedding.

I personally think that he will end up in an unhappy marriage and going through formalities won’t solve anything, so I decided against supporting their relationship knowing what I know. 

I know he needed a friend more than anything, but knowing too much just wouldn’t sit well with me on their day.

My (40F) husband (42M Jack) invited our niece (22F Holly), his sister’s daughter, to stay with us for a month. She was laid off and her mom was pressuring her to find work. He wanted to give her space to “decompress and think about next steps.” I love Holly, she’s wonderful. I’m happy to host her and am excited to see her. I took issue with Jack extending the invitation without looping me in first, he informed me after the fact. 

Some background. I’m the primary caregiver for my parents & grandma since 10/2021. They are disabled, don’t drive or cook. My mom has had a slew of medical issues with ~15 hospitalizations in the past 3 years plus ER visits I’ve lost count of. Two of her admissions she was in ICU on a vent and almost died - it’s been stressful. I’m at the hospital daily when she’s there and am her advocate. I’m her only child and all responsibility is on me; I’ve been severely burnt out for the past year juggling their needs and working a full time job. Jack is aware of my burnout. We started IVF in January, which adds another layer of stress. Jack works from home. He’s required in the office 3 weeks a year for scheduled events. 1 of those weeks was Holly’s 1st week here, which meant me stepping up to do the majority of work as hostess, cooking, etc. on top of caregiving tasks and IVF appts. Holly’s worth it. But given the stress in our life rn, I wanted to opt-in by my own choice versus being voluntold by Jack. 

When he told me she was coming I expressed only excitement. After her being here 2 weeks I spoke with him because he was checked-out about her visit and not communicating. For ex., her 1st week here he had to work late three nights due to events he knew in advance. I found out he wouldn’t be home until 10 pm when I text him at 4 asking what time I should have dinner ready. The 2nd week he was supposed to work from home. I found out at dinner Sun. night (because I asked a question about planning not because he told me) that his schedule changed and he was driving into the office the entire week. That night I expressed frustration at his lack of involvement in her stay. In the middle of the argument I said something like, “You invited her without giving me any say, the least you could do is communicate proactively, or book some tickets for the things she wants to do. I’ve made all the plans, purchased all the tickets, and made all her meals.” He said, “You want me to ask permission for someone to come to my house?” I said it wasn’t about asking permission, it was about communicating with his wife. He said, “We have a real problem if I have to ask you permission for someone to visit me in my house.” I repeated it wasn’t about permission, it was about treating his spouse as an equal and a partner. We’ve not yet resolved the conversation because we won’t argue in front of Holly (none of this is her fault and I don’t want her to think we are arguing because of her). 

ETA: Wow! I woke up to so many comments! Thank you all for taking time to read this and comment. I will read all of them but it may take me a bit. Some quick info based on the ones I’ve read so far:

- Holly is 22 but is young for her age. I don’t know if this matters or not but she isn’t from the U.S. and grew up in a country where it isn’t safe for her to go out and explore on her own (my in-laws’ words not mine). Because of that she isn’t very independent/confident, she just got her license and a car 1-2 years ago. I hadn’t considered letting her go explore on her own here but it doesn’t mean it isn’t feasible, that decision I’d probably leave in her and Jack’s hands. Also when I said to my husband, “I’ve cooked all her meals” what I meant (and he knew this) was dinner, I see how that’s not clear how I wrote it. She has been cooking for herself and cleaning after herself during the day (breakfast & lunch). My parents have specific dietary needs and I have to make them dinner anyway so I didn’t ask her to cook. She did offer to help with prep several nights and I took her up on that when she offered. She did make me lunch two days. 

- People were asking how much Jack normally helps around the house. We pay for cleaning service in our home twice a month and lawn service for our yard twice a month because we don’t have the time. Normally he and I split making dinner, 3 nights each and one night we get take out. He used to be fine with this but has gotten increasingly annoyed/grumpy about it over the past 1-2 years because my dad is a finicky eater, and I suspect he is also feeling burn out. I drive my family to 90% of their appointments but if I have a work conflict he will move things around to take them and does not complain about that. He handles all things grooming & vet for our dogs, we split pet feedings and potty breaks between us. He does his own laundry & ironing but defaults things like sheets and kitchen towels to me. He washes the dishes after dinner every night even if I tell him to let me do them sometimes. I make sure 90% of the bills get paid and handle the groceries. There has always been a selfish streak in him that flares over certain things but he can also be very thoughtful and considerate, especially with gift giving or planning dates/celebrations like birthdays. That has also taken a significant hit since my mom fell ill. He is not an incel tho he might sound like it in my post. 

- IVF, I will read all of these comments and consider them deeply. Will also share the sentiments with him and see how he feels & what he thinks. We don’t take the responsibility of becoming parents lightly. It is also something we’ve both always wanted, even with the added stress and chaos that littles bring. Perhaps because of my own upbringing it doesn’t feel insurmountable to caregive and be a mom. My mom and I moved in with my grandparents after she and my bio father divorced, he was abusive and totally absent from my upbringing. (The man I refer to as my dad is my stepdad). My grandfather was disabled on one side from a stroke and my grandmother caregave for him and also helped her mother-in-law, a great aunt, and an older 3rd cousin with no children with their groceries, errands, driving, etc. Difference being she was retired and all those women lived in different homes. I understand the unequal partners and disrespect red flags, which was why I posted here to see if my feelings were valid, and I will spend time reflecting on all of this before we start or postpone our next cycle.

8,1d6tp5s,WIBTA if I stop helping my ex coworker who is a single mother?,"My coworker was only at my work for less than two week. She was either terminated or quit, depending on who you ask. On her first day of work, she came to me begging for 20$. I don’t remember what she needed it for. She I gave her 40$ to help her out. After that point, she would come to me once and a while asking for more money. 
After work one day, I bought her over $150 of stuff including school supplies and a few dvds. When we were checking out, she asked for money on top of what I was getting her. She said it in a joking kind of way, but it still upset me. After she left out work place, she has reached out 3 times for help over the last month and a half. First she needed some money for her water bill, so I gave her 60$ to be nice. Then I was her light bill. And today she was asking for help with groceries for her and her kids. 
As much as want to keep helping her, it seems like she keeps guilting me into giving her more money. I am struggling to pay my mortgage and bills as well as the 25k I owe on my credit card. We are a single income family with my spouse who is unable to work because of disability issues. I feel guilty because she is a single mom but I feel like she is taking advantage of my kindness. So, would I be the asshole if I stopped helping her? 

Edit: the only reason I am conflicted is that it’s “they are about to turn my ___ off”  and “I can buy milk, do you have some a could have?” 
It’s like little stuff that I can easily help her with. But I am having trouble saying no when her two kids (middle school age) are being affected as well. 

UPDATE: Turns out you guys were right. I don’t know why I didn’t ask questions sooner. I decided to ask my coworkers if she asked them for money as well. Turns out she did ask everyone for money and I am the dumb one who said yes. She has a bf or husband to help her. She has been taking advantage of me after all. 
Unfortunately, I am a dumbass so I am meeting with her soon. I am going to give her the gallon of milk she asked for and ask her to not contact me again.

9,1d6t5ub,AITA for  trying to play my way through a local card game tournament?,"Today I entered a small local tournament for a card game, something like Magic or Yugioh. One of the participants is my roommate and the  judge (RJ for the sake of brevity). I know he doesn't like to play competitively and prefers causal play, so I tend to avoid playing with him since I usually play with a more competitive mindset, I try to make sure I am doing as well as I can in competitive scenarios. I feel people can play how they want as long as they don't intentionally hurt or disrespect others, and that that should apply to myself as well. However, RJ was in the tourny for today.



I couldn't avoid getting paired up against him in the second round. We went to our third game since he beat me in our second game and I even tried to compliment how he got me with an unexpected tactic. Then eventually he asks me a question about how a certain mechanic works. I misunderstood the question since it didn't fully make sense to me without context. I tried my best to answer, and then he made his play and I see what the context of his question was. I try to, as non-confrontationally as possible, point out how the play doesn't work according to the way the rules work in this scenario.



This results in RJ tearing into me for about 15 minutes. Now, objectively, he points out some issues about me that I had been unaware were problems, as I tend to get inside my own head about things and not realize if they don't come across the way I intend. There was a previous event that I did poorly in the first round, and he says he should have banned me from the store for poor sportsmanship since I left abruptly and according to him people complained about that. I was simply too frustrated with myself to keep playing so I removed myself from the scenario so I didn't say or do anything offensive. 



Another issue he pointed out was that I complain when I don't get good pulls from packs or when others get good pulls. I am used to people joking around like this when it comes to such things, so thought that was how people acted about such occurrences. I will be more mindful of this in the future. 



Primarily he complains that I play too seriously and that it has driven others from playing the game or ruined it for them. I can't say if this is true or not as he is the only one that has told me about this, but I have not heard from said people that it isn't true. 



So I simply just take what was said and reflect on it and don't react so as not to cause further issues. I play my next round as non-verbally as possible. RJ played for first place that third round, but lost to his opponent, but he did not go on any tired at that point. After the event, at least one player told me that as far as he knew he didn't know what RJ was on about, but that was the only feedback I'd heard.

I said yes because at the time I honestly didn’t have a problem and it was so far away I really didn’t think about it. Anyways since then I’ve been through alot.  
I, 21F, had to vacate my apartment temporarily due to renovations, which ended up extending to 2.5 months. Upon returning, I faced new problems such as noisy AC, screeching fire alarms, and unassembled furniture. Just a week ago, I finally settled back in after extensive spring cleaning and disposing of old items. Last week I refused to to pay one months rent. my landlord who hates me asked me for it in exchange for getting the dishwasher. I emailed her receipts of all my expenses due to the renovations and all the inconveniences (physical and emotional) I’ve had cause of all the problems in the apartment etc. she agreed to get it delivered but on one of the days my best friend is supposed stay with me.   
I’ve been dealing with a lot of academic stress due to the one course.  It was pretty bad to a point that it triggered my anxiety and by anxiety i mean panick attacks, stressing, crying, hating life, overall just a bad case of anxiety. Even my prof had a sit down meeting with me to ask me to get help from some mental help center. i ended up listening to her and getting help for it (the first time ever) and it helped a lottttttt and still is.   
I bought my best friend a ticket to an event as a birthday present, but she couldn't make it even though it was the day after her planned stay. She said she was going to be with her family, but I thought they had already left. Her stay would be from 1st-4th but the event was on the 5th. I spent a lot of my food/grocery budget on those tickets and was super sad.  
I also deal with a lot of trust, commitment, and social issues, which is why I barely have friends in the natural sense. I have friends I see every day, sort of like a ""let your daily life problems out committee,"" but that comes with no stress, commitments, or promises. I love those people and actually love hanging out with them more than seeing my own best friend or family. I’ve been raised in a religiously conservative community where having sleepovers and meeting friends' families isn't natural. I keep my family and friends' lives separate due to a toxic environment, but I still make an effort to connect with my bfs siblings' significant others and my sister's family.  
My best friend is coming to stay with me soon, and I'm feeling really anxious about it. I've been enjoying a much-needed break from stress, and I don't want to deal with hosting and cleaning.

16,1d6s5cf,AITA for choosing my rich friend over my poor friend?,"Edit: After some comments I’ve gotten I want to specify that I didn’t choose Rich Friend over Poor Friend because of how much money they have, the money is just an important part of the situation.
For the sake of this post I’ll call my friends A and T.
	I’m going on a family vacation soon and my parents asked if I wanted to take T with me to our vacation house. I asked if I could take A instead. T’s family doesn’t have a lot of money and A’s family is pretty wealthy, as is mine, and my parents said probably not, because they think it’s unfair to not take T when T wouldn’t be able to go without us. If my parents would have asked me a year ago it wouldn’t have mattered to me and I would have taken T over A (even though I love them equally) because A would have been able to go anyways and T wouldn’t have. 
	The thing is, T has made some pretty insensitive comments about a condition I got diagnosed with recently, and she has also started hanging out with people who openly talk bad about me. Also A moved away a few months ago and it’s been the longest we’ve been apart since we met in second grade. I see T everyday since we go to school together. I miss A a lot and I’ve been more uncomfortable around T. I still love them both but I want to take A because I haven’t seen her in a while and probably won’t for a long time.

17,1d6s15p,WIBTA for telling my best friend that she isn’t being a good friend recently?,"Sorry for any grammatical mistakes, writing this on my phone. 
Some context: Me (18F) and my best friend Jen (18F) have been friend for around 10 years now and we are essentially more like sisters. The issue started when she started dating Eli (18M) around 7 months ago.

I’ve noticed since Eli and Jen started dating she has become an awful friend. We used to see each other nearly everyday for hours and would tell each other everything about our lives. Now we hangout once a week and half the time we do, Eli is there. Normally I would not have a problem with this as I have many other friends who bring their bfs to our hangouts and we have a great time. The issue is he is an awful person. He treats Jen awfully and she doesn’t even realise it, he is extremely rude to me for no reason but then will also flirt with me when she is not in the room, he will tell both me and her not to do certain things but will then go and do the same with his friends, and is just not a pleasant person to be around. 

Recently I have noticed Jen has become distant and rude to me all the time. We would regularly go out drinking together almost every weekend but now she spends every day with Eli. She also has to make everything into a competition. Something is stressing me out? well she happens to be struggling with it more. We are also banned from talking about certain life events because it ‘stresses her out too much’ even though she literally has had almost everything handed to her in life. Whenever we hangout she doesn’t even pay attention to half the things i say or will interrupt me constantly to the point where i get so overwhelmed and go mute (i have autism). 

Edit: changed the names to fake names

20,1d6r674,AITA for applying for a long shot dream job without telling my wife?,"I (50M) married my wife (57F) and we raised 3 children to adulthood and have six grandchildren. We're happy and spend nearly all of our time together. It's a very pleasant life but an old flame that never quite went out intruded into it about a month ago. I read in an engineering trade rag that NASA was recruiting for a year long mission in a simulated Mars base. Mars might be simulated but the mission is real and it pays and includes room and board. So it would be fun for me and would pay the bills. When I checked it out online, I saw that NASA was recruiting real astronauts, too.

My wife knows that I had always wanted to be an astronaut and, as ridiculous as this sounds, I’m actually fairly qualified. I had tried to apply twenty-five years ago but my eyesight made it a non-starter. So I chose a different career path it's been fun and exciting and, despite having no formal training, my wife has been a big part of it while also running her own real estate investments which I help her on.

Now, NASA has relaxed the astronaut eyesight requirement and also changed the age range. And I was made more qualified by the skills that I picked up working on my wife's construction projects and fixing her heavy equipment. So I applied, putting those skills front and center. I never intended this to remain secret; I simply intended to ask her what she thought as soon as I heard anything from NASA which I expected to never happen.

But my wife saw me on my computer and asked me what I was doing so of course I told her. I thought that she'd find it amusing or at least benign but instead she hit the roof. Her objections were all reasonable. She wouldn’t relocate to Houston; being gone for a year wasn't the point of being married; we had children and grandchildren who needed me here; and it’s dangerous. Of course I stopped applying for the astronaut corps immediately and told her about the (actually more selective) simulated Mars mission that I had already applied for. I told her that I had never intended to continue without discussing it with her if I were miraculously contacted by NASA.

She was furious with me for having applied in the first place and wouldn't talk to me for two days! When NASA contacted me a few weeks later with some medical questions, I withdrew my application. But it remains a sore point with us and I really want to understand: should I have asked her opinion at such an early stage in such an improbable process? She thinks so and I am worried that I may be the asshole.

3 points of information: 1. It’s not that she simply thought acceptance was more likely than I did. 2.
