0,1d86ef0,AITA for potentially getting my 16 y/o co-worker fired?,"I (19 ftm) work at an outdoor summer camp and have worked there for going on 6 years. I‚Äôve been out as both queer and trans for the past 4 years and while have faced discrimination within schools or from strangers, co-workers at this camp have for the most part been kind to me. While attending staff training I started taking to a co-worker (I‚Äôll call Tanner) I met last year very briefly (17M) and we got pretty close and found out the other is queer. Because of how large staff is, our trainings are split into 2 groups and I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to have Tanner in my group each time so we talk and spend a lot of time together at the training. After one of the most recent trainings I got home a bit later and saw Tanner had texted me screenshots from a group chat he had been in for over a year where other counsellors had taken pictures of the both of us from behind and beside us throughout the trainings and captioned it with homophobic and transphobic slurs. Following that, multiple counsellors discussed how ‚Äòfagish‚Äô the two of us have become over the year. Tanner has dealt with harassment from these co-workers for a while but has been scared to do anything however I am not. I instructed him to take screenshots of every single thing he could while on the groupchat and send them to me as I drafted an email to supervisors and HR as well as highlighted sections of our camps code of conduct policy as well as anti bullying and harassment. I sent off multiple emails to all personnel‚Äôs above with videos and pictures but decided to reach out to the girl (16 F who I‚Äôll call Paige) who took the most pictures and videos to ask if she had called me the f and T slur upfront. When she texted back she responded saying ‚ÄòI did say that but I have the utmost respect for you and I‚Äôve been going through a really rough patch as of late and I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm doing this.

1,1d85n1o,AITA for cracking a joke about the displayed font in screenshots on a Facebook post?,"In a Facebook group, a member posted several screenshots of a conversation with a religious bigot about LGBT Pride but all the text was displayed in a hard-to-read font.

At any rate, I ""liked"" the post and then commented that I wish I could use both the ""Like"" and ""Angry"" reaction because I enjoyed her response in the conversation, but I strongly disliked the font, which made it very difficult to read. I even indicated in the response that my comment was intended as a bit of playful joking. 

She immediately responded that she hates that people focus on the font and not the message/purpose of her posts, but that she loves the font and she won't change it. I reiterate that it was intended as a joke and thank her for standing up for the LGBT community in her post, to which she responds ""to say that my font is making you more angry than the bigotry and homophobia displayed is indeed triggering.""

Since this is a private group and I'd rather not get suspended for a conflict, I just sucked it up and apologized while pointing out that my husband and I are LGBT (we're both trans, used to be in a lesbian relationship but he recently began his transition.)  Yes, what the bigoted person said in the screenshots was frustrating and the OP did a great job of standing up for LGBT people.

4,1d7mars,AITA for leaving my grandparents house early and causing family drama ?,"
I (22M) had an exhausting photo shoot job with my girlfriend (21F) this weekend. I hadn't slept well for 3-4 days, was dealing with my girlfriend's drama, pesky photographers, and a very rude, uncooperative driver. By the time our work ended, I was beyond tired.

My grandparents' house was nearby, and I hadn't visited in 3-4 years. I thought it would be a good time to see them and get some rest. When I arrived, I took all my cousins out for dinner. I was so tired that I passed out on the couch. The house lacks air conditioning, running water, and proper bathroom facilities, so I was literally sweating buckets while sleeping.

However, my cousins and aunts had other plans and didn't appreciate me getting some much-needed rest. They tried to wake me up by pulling, pushing, slapping, and screaming, which made me really mad and upset that they couldn't treat me like a human being.

I told them that I couldn't stay there any longer and would leave first thing in the morning. This created a huge issue, and they called my parents, who yelled at me for creating unnecessary problems.

It was such a bad experience that I don't want to visit there ever again.

Ten minutes later, Greg sent a selfie with Scoot outside Turbo‚Äôs house, asking to be let in, which made us uncomfortable since Scoot wasn‚Äôt invited.

For context, Scoot, Turbo, and Greg were in a love triangle. Greg had feelings for Scoot despite her two-timing him and Turbo. Knowing this, our group developed a distaste for Scoot. Greg and Turbo, though not close, had hung out with the group before without issues.

My oldest (8m) and third child (4f) are both signed up to go. My second child (7m) is in a grade level that is not going. I asked the school why he can't go because his older brother and younger sister are both allowed to go and have fun and I will be there with my youngest (1m) to chaperone. They told me that he cannot go and that this is a time for the kids that are going can spend with me and have fun. They said to make sure he goes to school that day and we're very firm about it. I asked how that is fair that his siblings get to have a fun field trip and he doesn't. Why is the 1st grade class not going when multiple grades above and below them are. They said that he will have a field trip to an educational place that the others don't get to go on. I said that makes no sense because his older and younger siblings already bragged about having gone to that place earlier in the year and it was boring.

After I hung up my family and I discussed pulling all of the kids that day and going to a different fun location instead. My younger two were excited about it but my oldest was upset. He understands that we are trying to be fair to all of them but he doesn't want to miss out on time with his friends. So we are back to considering just taking my middle child on the field trip anyway. I have always tried to ensure all my kids get to have fun and the school is trying to tell me it would be unfair of me to bring the one they don't want to go because somehow the kids that are going will have less fun with him there.

Update: Okay so we came up with a new plan. Kids are asleep so will talk to them tomorrow and see if they're all okay with it. We'll let the field trip go as the school plans and then take just my 1st grader on a different day this summer. Both siblings are old enough to be understanding about making sure everyone gets treated fairly. To help them all feel less left out I can find a different way to make his day at school fun without breaking school rules and then copy it for the other 2 when we take just him to the park this summer. The school has always allowed the kids to bring snacks for the whole class if they want to so I'll send him to class with cupcakes for him and his friends that day.

Update: Okay so we came up with a new plan. Kids are asleep so will talk to them tomorrow and see if they're all okay with it. We'll let the field trip go as the school plans and then take just my 1st grader on a different day this summer. Both siblings are old enough to be understanding about making sure everyone gets treated fairly. To help them all feel less left out I can find a different way to make his day at school fun without breaking school rules and then copy it for the other 2 when we take just him to the park this summer. The school has always allowed the kids to bring snacks for the whole class if they want to so I'll send him to class with cupcakes for him and his friends that day. Then give the sitter cupcakes to share with the other two while he's at the park with me later on.",1.0,0.11950526,0,0

11,1d7l2jj,AITA for going alone to a festival instead of with my friend?,"This post isnt as exciting or fierce as some stories in this reddit channel and some people probalby think I am whining or making a fuss about nothing but its been bugging me and I have been thinking about it alot:

First I wanted to give some context: My friends and I have been attending multiple raves/festivals over the past few years and we like it very much. Everytime someone suggested to go to a rave/festival, I went along with it. Its not like I went against my wishes or there were bad artists, but the specific lineup/artists were never really my choice. There was a time when I suggested some raves/festivals but these requests were rejected/played off by changing topic etc, have not suggested anything ever since.

So There is this big festival called defqon we went to last year thats organised anually and consists of multiple days. I have been passionate and excited about Defqon ever since I got into the harder styles. My friends and I had planned that we wanted to go to defqon this year and I bought saturday tickets for the group (the lineup was not yet released, but we had fun on the same day last year) So when the lineup was released, I discovered that almost none of the artists I listen to were performing on saturday, but on friday. I asked the gang if it was alright if we went friday instead of saturday (3/4 people didnt really care about the lineup, but one other person did) We had a discussion about this and it ended with the me promising to go to another festival with him which he told me about, that had the same music genre as Defqon saturday. Everything was settled and the plan was to go friday.

When the gang gathered at a birthday party, 2 friends told me they couldnt go on friday since they had to request leave from work. They asked me if it was alright if we went on saturday because of this reason. As much as it pained me to go saturday, I told them it was fine and we could go saturday if there was really no other way, so that we could go as a whole group. (It pained me to go saturday because this is the festival I have been waiting a whole year for since we went last year and the lineup of friday is a once in a lifetime experience. The artists I listen to are not to be found on other events or are really scarce.)

1 week later, we bought the partybus tickets for Saturday, but the same 2 friends told me that they maybe can not make it because of school exams in that semester and are doubting. We unfortunately already bought the party bus tickets and my reason to go saturday has vanished if they decide not to go. I kind of feel a bit betrayed and made it clear that I want to go friday, if they decide to skip this festival. The other person said that he will go alone if I wont join him on Saturday now.

12,1d7kny9,AITA for cancelling my family vacation due to conflict from over 10 years ago?,"My parents (60s) invited me (mid 20s) and a friend to join their international vacation this fall. They booked the resort in January/February after confirming in December that I might be interested, but they said I don‚Äôt have to say yes. They let me and my sibling bring one guest each. My parents are paying for the lodging, and I would get a private room with my friend. I confirmed me and my friend‚Äôs attendance in February because I didn‚Äôt know that I would end up going low contact with my parents. I cancelled our RSVP (with my friend‚Äôs consent) in May because I worried it would be bad for my health, especially after what would be an 8+ month period of barely tolerating talking to my mother on the phone for 5 minutes/month.  

My parents are very hurt and upset. When politely asked for an explanation, I told them that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in my best interests to see them for a while, including them coming to visit me. (My father used to be very abusive when me and my sibling were growing up, and I have been diagnosed with PTSD due to those experiences.) I didn‚Äôt elaborate, and they haven‚Äôt inquired any further. Our family history is the elephant in the room that we never talk about despite my clumsy attempts. There have been no efforts on their part to identify or resolve any issues, though that could be because they‚Äôre trying to give me space.

I‚Äôm not trying to punish my parents. I‚Äôm sure they thought of this as a fun experience that we never could have dreamt of affording when I was growing up. Part of me feels guilty because my dad has made some efforts over the years to be better, and I know my parents had only good intentions with this trip. I wonder if my cancellation is like demanding that they be better, only to then shred their gift/efforts while they watch. In theory, I could have endured the stress leading up to the trip and probably had some amount of fun at the resort while avoiding rocking the boat.

Valentine‚Äôs Day came up and I will admit, I was a little disappointed he didn‚Äôt get me a flower or a card but he said it wasn‚Äôt a special day and I felt a little silly for placing any importance on it. 

His birthday this year, I bought a bunch of balloons, the kind which spell out ‚Äúhappy # birthday‚Äù a dozen regular balloons and a little party hat. We got into an argument because he told me to get off my phone, and I told him I was in the middle of a sale (I have a small, maybe even tiny side hustle where I sell plants and art‚Äù.

He tells me that I didn‚Äôt spend time with him on his birthday and didn‚Äôt listen when he told me to get off my phone. I felt so guilty for doing something so stupid and what I thought to be insignificant. 

I was hurt because my effort to try and make the day special seemed looked over, even though I only bought him balloons. Beforehand I had asked him if there was anything he wanted as a gift and he maintained he didn‚Äôt want anything. I told him that I was trying to make the day special and that he didn‚Äôt even care for my effort. I stupidly brought up Valentine‚Äôs Day where we didn‚Äôt do anything special and he said that I didn‚Äôt get him anything either (except a card). 

This matters because I was out today and decided to buy him a comic and a cute bouquet of flowers, to show him appreciation. When I handed it to him he just looked at the comic and said the flowers looked dry. He didn‚Äôt even take it when I handed it to him, I had to tell him to hold it and he just started talking about where he parked the car. It really ruined my mood and he told me to stop acting like an A-hole and that I only get him presents I like. I wanted to cry when he said that. I don‚Äôt know why.

23,1d8ae6g,AITAH for yelling at my son and his girlfriend which may have caused her to block him?,"I (45F) and my husband (45m) have a 17-year old son. He met his girlfriend a couple years ago when they were both in the same class. They started going steady sophomore year. Half way through sophomore year, GF‚Äôs family moved halfway across country to be closer to family. My son was devastated but they decided they weren‚Äôt going to break up and just have a long distance relationship.

The first 6 months wasn‚Äôt bad and we did travel to visit her around that time. Upon coming home, I noticed they argued more, but I stayed out of it. My husband and I would offer counsel when he asked otherwise this was his relationship.

It‚Äôs been a year and a half since she moved and a year since they‚Äôve seen each other. Their fights have escalated with yelling, name calling, and swearing. We turned his phone off for a few days after one particularly nasty fight which, as always, ended with him in tears begging her to forgive him. 

The fights have always been about stupid things like, he went to the movies with some of his buddies (all guys) or the fact that he fell asleep on a phone call because we are two hours ahead of her and she forgets that while it‚Äôs 10pm at her house, it‚Äôs midnight here. Or because he was eating before going to work at a fast food place to help pay for the trip we were supposed to take in two weeks.

I work from home and this morning they were really on it. I had my headphones in and could still hear them yelling on the phone. Annoyed with this plus some other non-related issues, I initially texted him to knock it off. I was trying to work. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt have any phone meetings this morning. 

He answered saying ‚Äútell her that.‚Äù So I did. I made a group chat with the three of us and basically said, both of you knock it off as I am trying to work and I am tired of the weekly (sometimes multiple times a week) fight. I then said that if they kept fighting I may not be bringing him to visit in a couple weeks. There was more shouting followed by him crying hysterically. She answered that we didn‚Äôt need to make the trip. I let them both know I won‚Äôt make any changes yet and allow everyone to cool off, but she‚Äôs blocked him now.

While this is far from the first time she has blocked him, I feel that if I kept my ‚Äúmouth shut‚Äù (or at least not threatened to cancel our trip) maybe he wouldn‚Äôt be hurting right now and she wouldn‚Äôt have blocked him. AITAH?

Update:

Thanks for helping me reaffirm that I am not the AH in this case and also reaffirming his relationship sounds toxic. For those that thinks I need to warn my son about the red flags, I have tried. As the fights have increased he has talked to me about some of them. I have told him that I thought their relationship was not great. I‚Äôve explained what I thought was toxic about it only to be met with anger on his part. Any derogatory remark about her and he gets pissed! The two of them try to control each other when it comes to who they speak to, which was one thing I pointed out as toxic.

Unfortunately, for me, they started talking again late last night. I‚Äôm so tired it‚Äôs not even funny, but he‚Äôs 17 (will be 18 in Jan) so there is little I can do. I‚Äôve tried explaining that, as part of their fights have been about accusing each other of cheating, that if there is no trust there is no real relationship. He is starting to get tired of it so maybe he‚Äôll wise up soon.

I did find out that yesterday‚Äôs blow up was about something he liked on Twitter years before he even met her! He doesn‚Äôt even have Twitter (or X) anymore after a grown man propositioned him when he was 13. It was immediately reported and he never went on the app again. (He was on with my permission and he immediately told me when it happened).

As the fights have increased he has talked to me about some of them. I have told him that I thought their relationship was not great. I‚Äôve explained what I thought was toxic about it only to be met with anger on his part. Any derogatory remark about her and he gets pissed! The two of them try to control each other when it comes to who they speak to, which was one thing I pointed out as toxic.

Unfortunately, for me, they started talking again late last night. I‚Äôm so tired it‚Äôs not even funny, but he‚Äôs 17 (will be 18 in Jan) so there is little I can do. I‚Äôve tried explaining that, as part of their fights have been about accusing each other of cheating, that if there is no trust there is no real relationship. He is starting to get tired of it so maybe he‚Äôll wise up soon.

I did find out that yesterday‚Äôs blow up was about something he liked on Twitter years before he even met her! He doesn‚Äôt even have Twitter (or X) anymore after a grown man propositioned him when he was 13. It was immediately reported and he never went on the app again. (He was on with my permission and he immediately told me when it happened).

24,1d8acpx,AITA for reminding my friend that she married for intelligence and look where it got her?,"I (35F) met my husband Vince (36M) after he saved me from drowning at a pool party when I was 18. I took him out for lunch the following week to thank him for saving me, and we soon fell in love and began dating. 

At the time, Vince worked a blue collar job while I was studying in university. We ended up getting married and Vince supported me throughout my entire education up until I got my PhD. 

Vince always told me that he wanted to study in university but had learning disabilities that made it difficult for him to study in a classroom. At times he was embarrassed by the fact that he had to work twice as hard compared to people around him, but I always found that to be admirable about him. 

When I finished my studies and got a well paying job I convinced Vince to give his dream of studying another go. 

Last year he was finally accepted into a nursing program at our local university. He is working hard to achieve him dream and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of him.

Last week my friend Alba (36F) came to visit with her son so our children could play together. Alba was my roommate during my first year in university, she began dating her husband Leo around the same time I started dating Vince. 

Leo was an obnoxious law student who later on became an even more obnoxious attorney. He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. 

At the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo‚Äôs law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. 

Alba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. 

As we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).

I told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn‚Äôt smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. 

Alba was deeply hurt by what I‚Äôve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that
I was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize. 

___________

Small update: first of all I want to thank you all for your replies :) 

I wanted to address a couple of things, many of you asked why Alba and I remained friends despite her previous remarks. Alba and I grew apart during our third year in university, we only remained friends by association since we have a lot of shared mutual friends. 

We became close again after our sons started playing basketball together at the local community center and became friends. I figured that becoming a mother made her more mature and she didn‚Äôt give me any reason to suspect otherwise. 

I‚Äôve decided to send her a message saying that the way she spoke about my husband and son was unacceptable and therefore she is no longer welcomed in my home, however, I don‚Äôt want our sons to lose their friendship and therefore I‚Äôm willing to remain civil around the kids and still organize play dates. She didn‚Äôt reply to me just yet, but I truly hope she loves her son enough to put her ego aside and remain civil for the sake of our kids.

I‚Äôve yet to notify Vince about this entire situation since he is vigorously studying for an important quiz that‚Äôs coming up next week, and I know that if he heard what Alba said about him and our boy it would make him upset and he won‚Äôt be able to continue studying properly. Unless something crazy happens in the meantime I‚Äôll probably update him next week after he‚Äôs done with the quiz.

For most of my recalled childhood my mother has been verbally abusive, and overall unkind.
My mom needs therapy from past trauma but refuses. 

Recently my older sister (41) relapsed on drugs and keyed my car. Then went to jail, was let out then got arrested again. I called my mom to discuss her being put into a mental health facility. My mom then takes out everything on me. She‚Äôs been without plumbing for two days, she‚Äôs upset and I tried to talk to her. She started to blame my sister and I for her health issues. She called me ungrateful and unloving because I didn‚Äôt offer her to use my bathroom when my brothers did. (To be honest I did not think she‚Äôd even use my shower had I offered)
She acts like everything I do is stupid and I‚Äôm beneath her.

She was also upset my daughter (11) told me that she scolded her for texting her about a shopping trip then compared my daughter to my older sister (relapsed) I asked her about that and didn‚Äôt agree with it.

My mom has also always hated my husband, right now he‚Äôs in the process of getting help for very severe depression. She starts in on him for not being the same person. He has been struggling with mental health issues for 10+ years. 

My mother has always been an narcissistic person and never admits in any wrongdoing and blaming others. 
When I was 18 she took multiple credit cards out in my name paid them for a bit then maxed them out and stopped paying, used my ssn for a mortgage. She‚Äôs not once admitted to that. I have proof that she did though through one cc company that actually helped me with fraud.

Now she‚Äôs told the whole family I‚Äôm an asshole.

We all flew to Tara's home town for her wedding. It's a cross-cultural union, so they had two ceremonies to celebrate both the groom & bride's subcultures. We had helped Naomi with preparation & general know-how as it was her first time visiting or attending a wedding outside her culture.

At the first wedding ceremony, Naomi got irked at women wearing the similar colour & silhouettes as the bride. Literally no one gives a fudge about that here. I told her so, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. I pointed out to her how some women had even worn their own wedding attires, just dressed down. Tara's sister had too. Again, deaf ears & absolutely stupid arguments. She started showing me TikToks about how it's the bride's friends' duty to spill drinks on people trying to upstage the bride. It's a global world. Doesn't matter the culture, respecting the bride is important across them all. Absolutely asinine BS. When the party had reached high spirits, she actually started looking for a target. These women were sisters, aunts, in laws, mothers' friends! Naomi isn't a professional prankster. It would have looked intentional too. I told my other friends what she was upto & we managed to end the night without an issue. She wasn't even the only American first timer there. Other foreign guests were having a great time, idk what got into her.

At the afterparty, we jokingly told Tara about it. She laughed, called Naomi an ass, & told her not to create a scene.

She almost DID spill at the groom's aunt & filmed herself doing it. I was too hung over+drunk+tired+distracted+pissed to babysit her. I had to ask her to leave. She obviously didn't want to but missed out on the second wedding reception.

That night I texted Tara to tell her everything. She sent me a pat on the back GIF. But Naomi was real pissed. Still is. I did feel guilty, so I went above & beyond to make the rest of her trip nicer. Didn't let her pay for anything, including her stay & souvenirs. Took her to every place on her checklist. Got her a chauffeur driven car, etc. She still thinks I was the ass, not her, because she missed out on the reception.

The issue is that my cousin will be coming to visit for a few days and is not as open as I am to different lifestyle s.  So after clearing the visit with my roommate, and I mentioned the potential issue and requested that he refrain from his activities while in the common areas during the visit.

38,1d86z3f,AITA for telling my roommate to buy earplugs if she doesn't like my typing?,"1. Hey all,

I live in a shared apartment with four other people. The apartment has really thin walls and sound carries easily. My room is on the second floor, directly above one of my roommate's room. Let's call her Stella.

Ever since she moved in, Stella has complained about me making noise. She said that she could hear me move around late at night and that it was keeping her awake. That's probably true, because the floors are pretty creaky and I'm a night owl. I've since tried my hardest to move carefully around my room in the evenings. 

One of Stella's more difficult complaints is that she can hear me typing on my desktop computer. I've often received messages from her where she asks me to stop using my desktop after her bedtime (9-10 PM) or to do my work in the living room instead. The thing is, a lot of my work is done on the desktop. I do a lot of digital art on it. It feels a little unreasonable that I shouldn't be allowed to do my work and hobbies on my desktop after Stella's bedtime. I might understand it if I was up at 3 AM clacking away, but most of these complaints are from 10-12 PM. 

Stella's pretty polite and she doesn't get mad, but she doesn't seem to accept my explanations. Yesterday she sent me a message at 9:30 asking me to stop using the desktop, and I told her flatly that if she was struggling so badly with sleeping she should buy some earplugs. That response wasn't well received.

 This is the first time I'm living in a shared apartment, so I might be in the wrong here. I was under the impression that I should have the right to do normal activities in my room at any time of day, but have I crossed a line here?

We don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúwedding party‚Äù although my fiance asked his brother to be his unofficial best man, but it‚Äôs just a sentiment and doesn‚Äôt come with any real role. We decided early on we weren‚Äôt interested in having bachelor or bachelorette parties because we don‚Äôt really believe in the significance behind them of ‚Äúcelebrating your freedom.‚Äù We told the unofficial best man and maid of honor we weren‚Äôt interested in and not to worry about it. 

Last night my fianc√©s mom said something about one of my finance‚Äôs friends (let‚Äôs call him Tom) ‚Äúplanning‚Äù something for Thursday. We get married on Saturday and have a rehearsal dinner on Friday. Tom is not the best man and no conversation about him being a best man has ever occurred.

 My fiance texted Tom, saying he heard something about a plan for Thursday and wanted to know what was up. Immediately Tom FaceTimed us and he sheepishly admitted he was planning a bachelor party. He went into some details about the plan (mostly getting drunk) and said that my friends had planned something for me. The gist of it was basically that he planned a party and invited everyone but me and my closest female friends. 

I was so shocked at the lengths he had gone to coordinate this behind our backs (including picking people up from an airport that‚Äôs 2 hours away, contacting dozens of our friends he had either met briefly or didn‚Äôt know at all, and also finding my mom on Facebook to get someone to plan something for me) I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. 

My fiance didn‚Äôt know what to say either and looked at me like it was my decision to call this off or not. I said something along the lines of ‚Äúomg no, we don‚Äôt want bachelor parties I‚Äôm not interested in this.‚Äù I felt very put on the spot but also bad for clearly ruining weeks of planning.

On one hand it seems sweet that Tom went so out of his way to plan and coordinate this event, but on the other hand it seems like a huge overstep to do it without any input from us. I also think he knows us well enough to know that if we were asked we would say we aren‚Äôt interested, and that‚Äôs why it was planned in secret. 

If we hadn‚Äôt heard something beforehand it would have been a complete ambush right before our wedding. I can‚Äôt explain how much panic I would have felt if Tom showed up unannounced on Thursday to take my fiance away on a secret bachelor party night‚Ä¶. It would have ruined the entire night and probably the next day, even if my friends had planned something for me. (Again, I‚Äôm pregnant. Whatever they had planned for me wasn‚Äôt a wild night, whereas knowing Tom, his was).

Im a dumb teenager ok i can be reckless at times and have some mental stuff going on as of recently but pls note im a good kid..i follow the rules and rarely get in trouble. 

For my birthday recently i got a quad in march. I work on it daily wash it pay for the gas ECT. I rarely ask anyone for help minus my bike friends for air in my tires from time too time thats it. 

Now onto the events of yesterday. Yesterday i had a terrible day at work my morning started with me fighting with one of my friends and getting stressed with my mom before work. My dad dropped me off and picked me up. I got home overwhelmed and just not ok especially without medication. My mom is currently sick with a bad flu and told me too take my younger sister (age 7) out for a bike ride. I said fine after arguing for a bit and took my bike out but i was unaware my dad had tied my lock around my tire. So when i pushed my bike out, my back bar of my bike bent with my tire and my lock broke. So me and my sister went too the store and we bought a new lock and tried our best too fix my back bar which is very very heavy not even our friends could help. I was having bad anxiety so my friends said too go on a solo ride and let my sister play with their siblings. So i agreed. Worse. Mistake. Of. My. Life. I went over 100 mph maybe more due too how stressed i was‚Ä¶i let loose. I lost control after going over a speed bump at full speed and well, i landed terribly. I had so much adrenaline i didnt feel the pain till i got too my friends house. I got there took my sister home and got back home. My dad was outside when he saw me and gave me a dissatisfied look and slammed the door shut. My mom came out yelling at me asking why i did what i did and was just so disgusted and disappointed in me. I didnt know what to do as i was putting my bike away but soon the pain hit and i was trying too get my bike up but couldnt. I was in alot of pain. My dad put my bike away and bandaged me up as the wounds i had were bleeding so much even through my shirt. So my dad got me in the car as we got too the ER, i checked myself in and was taken back 10 minutes later. My dad was behind me and i turned around in tears and said ‚Äúdont bother coming, your mad and your just going too yell at me.‚Äù And i walked away..when i was discharged my doctor said too my dad i would be seeing a psychiatrist soon too reevaluate me and that my wounds were minor. I basically ripped my skin open on the sides of my legs arms and a part of my side so i had stitches done. My dad was on facetime with my mom and in the car she was yelling at me till we made it home. When i got home i cried too my friends on the phone unable too move and just sorta passed out. This morning my mom wont talk too me and keeps giving me a grossed out look. 


I feel like i may be the asshole for many reasons but at the same time. I feel like my parents need too understand im growing. I will make mistakes at times but i also know that arguing with my mother who‚Äôs sick was a bad side on my part. Im not sure if i really am the asshole for getting hurt and feeling like shit. Im unsure of what to do as of currently.

",Asshole,2024-06-04,"AITA for telling my dad i didnt want him in the hospital room with me? Ok, hi this is my first ever post on here. So some stuff about me,
Im a dumb teenager ok i can be reckless at times and have some mental stuff going on as of recently but pls note im a good kid..i follow the rules and rarely get in trouble. 

For my birthday recently i got a quad in march. I work on it daily wash it pay for the gas ECT. I rarely ask anyone for help minus my bike friends for air in my tires from time too time thats it. 

Now onto the events of yesterday. Yesterday i had a terrible day at work my morning started with me fighting with one of my friends and getting stressed with my mom before work. My dad dropped me off and picked me up. I got home overwhelmed and just not ok especially without medication. My mom is currently sick with a bad flu and told me too take my younger sister (age 7) out for a bike ride. I said fine after arguing for a bit and took my bike out but i was unaware my dad had tied my lock around my tire. So when i pushed my bike out, my back bar of my bike bent with my tire and my lock broke. So me and my sister went too the store and we bought a new lock and tried our best too fix my back bar which is very very heavy not even our friends could help. I was having bad anxiety so my friends said too go on a solo ride and let my sister play with their siblings. So i agreed. Worse. Mistake. Of. My. Life. I went over 100 mph maybe more due too how stressed i was‚Ä¶i let loose. I lost control after going over a speed bump at full speed and well, i landed terribly. I had so much adrenaline i didnt feel the pain till i got too my friends house. I got there took my sister home and got back home. My dad was outside when he saw me and gave me a dissatisfied look and slammed the door shut. My mom came out yelling at me asking why i did what i did and was just so disgusted and disappointed in me. I didnt know what to do as i was putting my bike away but soon the pain hit and i was trying too get my bike up but couldnt. I was in alot of pain. My dad put my bike away and bandaged me up as the wounds i had were bleeding so much even through my shirt. So my dad got me in the car as we got too the ER, i checked myself in and was taken back 10 minutes later. My dad was behind me and i turned around in tears and said ‚Äúdont bother coming, your mad and your just going too yell at me.‚Äù And i walked away..when i was discharged my doctor said too my dad i would be seeing a psychiatrist soon too reevaluate me and that my wounds were minor.

42,1d85uzs,AITA for calling my DIL a manipulator?,"My son20 has dated this girl20 for 4 yrs.1st problem was that it was a secret. I only found out because this girls parents did and demanded my son marry her. He had slept with her and their religion called for it. I was mad at my son, why would he get with a girl from a whole different lifestyle? Why hide it from his family since now he's gotten into this huge mess. I was mad at the girl. if she knew her parents are extremely religious and will react this way why not be with a man in her religion? In the end the girl moved to her home country. I did feel for her. She was right at the age that she needed to spread her wings and go to college or work, not sent to a third world country with no opportunities.

My son was upset. he became more closed off and I heard him crying at night in his room. He started work once he was 18 and I barely saw him since he would work late. Later the girl came back. And the two of them were always on call. I couldn't get a single conversation with my son without her on his phone waiting for him to finish up our conversation so he can go back to her. Son said she worked but I highly doubted it. They were talking 24/7. What job lets their workers text all the time? This girl also never sleeps because they would stay up late talking. It was my idea she move in and now I regret it.

My son was never affectionate but with her, he is. They're always on top of each other. The two are never apart, he always laughs and hugs her. Not once have I ever seen him like this even with me. She was making him go all out when they were just starting to be bf &gf. She always cooks the same thing. She won't make different meals, if she does it is from her culture. She never ate my cooking and then my son also stopped eating my cooking. When I tell him I cooked for him he tells me that his gf will cook for him instead.

I feel him getting distant. And I can't help but feel like she's the reason. He was never like this. I try to fix it, I have this friend who gives massages. My son works hard so I invite him to get a massage and he said no, his gf gives him great massages and would rather get one from her instead of paying for it.I can't do anything with him anymore. And the main thing is the two of them eloped. No regard to his family or mother. It all happened out of the blue. I feel like he got pressured into marrying. That she told him to do all of these things.

I told my son that she is a manipulator who controls him. everything has to be her way on her time. She is forcing him to treat her like a wife and marry her when they are too young and should be taking it slow. I feel like she is separating him from his family because she no longer has her family.

My son told me that He's putting her first in his life now and I need to respect and stop badmouthing her or keep the comments to myself. It's like another person was talking through my son.

43,1d85tpw,AITA Wife continues to pay mother‚Äôs mortgage,"My wife has been paying her mother‚Äôs mortgage now for a little over 4 years. This started back in 2020 unrelated to COVID but due to her uncle being hospitalized and her mother deciding to assist with household expenses on his behalf. 

We share expenses pretty much on an income/expense ratio where it is fair to how much each spouse brings into the home. 

I did not find out about my wife paying her mother‚Äôs mortgage until a little over a year later in 2021. She finally told me after we were discussing our own finances and how we would move forward in family planning. When she decided to tell me, it was framed as if she was helping her mother cover bills since she was assisting her brother (my wife‚Äôs uncle) coming out of the hospital. I was told it would not last forever but she would discuss with her mom how hey would handle it moving forward. 

I was surprised at her making this decision without telling me, but understanding due to the situation and COVID wreaking havoc at the same time all this was going on. 

The year goes on and mortgage payment continues, it occasionally comes up in discussions during budget meetings but I‚Äôm being led to believe that it is soon coming to an end. March 2022 we decide to purchase her a new to us vehicle for the coming baby. Meanwhile the mortgage payments are still ongoing and she is bringing concern about household expenses. 

We have the discussion again about when would her paying for her mom‚Äôs house would stop and she says soon because he is transitioning to be under care of a full time nurse. That sounds great to me!

Baby and mom are home safe May 2022. It‚Äôs time to clear hospital bills. I end up clearing a little over 11k of debt including the hospital stuff that has been slowly accumulating over the past years from what I believe is her inability to contribute to our home and cover the additional mortgage. 

Argument ensues and she informs me that while she is still paying her mother‚Äôs mortgage, she feels that our household expenses went up. Of course they did, we had a baby. Between groceries and hiring additional help to assist there was an adjustment period. She also feels that she should not have to stop paying her mom‚Äôs mortgage because she wants to help her by giving back. This is news to me because I was under the impression that the payments would end given that we are starting our own family and her uncle is under someone else‚Äôs care.

We have multiple arguments over 2022-2023 about this because I feel that her story changed on why the payments won‚Äôt end. Keep in mind they were going on for a year before I knew. Neither of us will budge on our POV on the situation because she says that she has the income to support it. I counter with the debt that has accumulated on her personal accounts that I‚Äôve had to payoff. 

We decide to move in 2023 to be closer to her family and my work since she is remote, both of my parents are deceased. We had discussions on how this would help us by occasionally having support around the house. During the moving process I am surprised again with another debt balance that shows up. I clear another 12k and my patience has worn thin. 

It is 2024, 4+ years into her deciding on her own with her mother to take on her house payment. She says that her mom does not need her to make the house payments but that she wants to give back to her since she was a single mom. Meanwhile her mom does not assist us with childcare and occasionally shows up once or twice a month to spend a few hours with her grandson.

Since then she has tried to hook me up with Lucy multiple times. I have always refused cause Lucy isn't really my type, but Sarah dismisses me every time and says I should at least give her one chance. Furthermore, I wouldn't consider Lucy my friend even though she hangs out with us almost every week. I don't dislike her and I'm always cordial, but to me she's just Sarah's friend and if she stopped going out with us I probably wouldn't keep contact with her.

Now, three months ago I met a girl, Maria, at my climbing gym. I saw her struggling with a boulder I had also had problems with in the past and gave her a couple of tips. The following week we met again, she told me the tips helped her a lot and she wanted to buy me a coffee to thank me. We had a great time and ended up meeting again that weekend.

Apart from my two best friends, the rest didn't know I was dating someone but since we were there I introduced Maria to the group and we all spent the evening together. Everyone had a great time but I could feel Sarah and Lucy were kinda cold to me.

48,1d854em,AITA for making my coworkers aware that the manager has been stealing from everyone?,"I have been working at a fast food place. Last month, I was able to pick up work at a sister store, after the GM scheduled me for 4 hours for the entire week. I'm supposed to be a FT employee.

When I was there, I saw that the manager wasn't tipping himself out. When I asked, he said it was against company policy. Meanwhile, the GM at my home store had been making everyone include her in the division of tips if she was in the store. I googled it, and not only was it against company policy, it was a violation of federal and state law. And it's considered wage theft. The sister store's GM suggested I report it to the DM. I did, and he said he would correct it immediately.

For me, this job was just to get some money coming in while I was job hunting. I recently started at a new position in an office, that has better pay and some of the nicest, most down to earth managers I have ever met. Which means, I could now afford to do and say something (I had asked the DM not to mention my name to my GM, but it would have been really obvious).

I had to reduce the hours I could work, due to the new job, so I obviously expected them to get cut down from FT, at *this* point. The GM texted me 2 days before my Saturday shift, asking if I would be in. At this point, it was a 4 hour shift. The day before, I get a text that the schedule has changed, and I'm now only scheduled 2 hours. I asked her why, mentioning her dishonesty regarding my hours previously. I then ask her if this is retaliation for reporting her for wage theft. I mention the laws and the company policies she'd broken.

(I should mention that before this, she worked in a restaurant for over a decade, same state. Very unlikely she didn't know the rules.)

When the upcoming schedule came out, I asked more questions, including ones that specifically mentioned that she stole from *everyone*. Turns out, I'd been messaging the work chat this entire time. Whoops.

What was weird though, was that my coworkers started attacking *me*. They said I was being toxic, and were acting like this was a problem specific to me. They acted like I was publicly taking ""my frustrations"" out on her. But *they* were the ones I was actually mad *on behalf of*- not that I ever said it. I had only been there a few months, but there were long term workers who had kids, who had to take up second jobs. This was their primary source of income. For the GM to steal from them, was just appallingly wrong. It might sound like I'm being ridiculous, but I viewed saying something about this, as a moral imperative.

I chose the song Padam Padam by Kylie Minogue. I saw the music video and was impressed by the music, so I thought it fit really well. It ended up losing out to a song called CVNT by Sophie Hunter. A few folks called my choice basic and one comment was particularly sharp saying that it sounded like I got it from a pride playlist.

I saw this as being a really easy and unoriginal choice- it‚Äôs literally just saying ‚Äúc*nt‚Äù over and over, so I thought this was a fair comparison. 

Somehow this sparkes a long thread. Everyone came out of the woodwork to call me basic. Apparently Padam Padam played a lot last year and was considered a ‚Äúgay anthem‚Äù.

The thing that really offended me was that no one stopped to warn me or take me aside and explain how I was going too far or what I was doing wrong.

51,1d84grt,AITA for asking my friend to cope with people drinking? ,"For context I'm in a friendship group and three people in the group have their birthday In the same month. So we decided to all meet up at one of our houses and just hang out to celebrate. 

There will be 6 of us, 3 of us want to drink and 2 others don't drink but are fine with others drinking. However we have 1 friend who had a bad up bringing with an alcoholic father. They are uncomfortable around people who are drunk and we have gone out of our way to not drink or drink very lightly around them to make them comfortable. However 3 of us want to get drunk to celebrate their birthday as its a special event and we want them all to be there.

We have said In advance that we want to drink at this party and that she doesn't have to go if she doesn't want to. I understand that she will feel left out if she doesn't go so we putting the decision on her. And we won't force her to drink either (because that's a terrible thing to do. We wouldn't do that to anyone) however she has been getting quite angry of late. She has been making comments about how we don't have to drink but we want to. We don't get together often as we're all busy with work so we can't just ""make another date"" because that will be months away. And she wants to come to this one. 

After all the comments I admit I got a bit annoyed and eventually replied with this (fake names) 

""But it's like this. 
It's a, b and c birthday. 2/3 want to drink and the other one doesn't care. You were invited because we all want you there. I hate to sound harsh or anything and I understand that you're uncomfortable but unfortunately this really is a situation of just having to deal with it. Or ""cope"" as what a says""

Ever since she's refused to talk to me and I don't know if she is even coming or wants to stay friends or what. 

I understand she is uncomfortable but we haven't drank with each other over a year now and I feel like it's unfair for the rest of us to not drink when we want to but we also don't want to leave her out as we might not see each other for a couple of months so AITA? 

Edit: a couple of people have brought up the fact that she can leave when people start drinking and we all do something in the day. Unfortunately this isn't available. We staying the night at this person house who lives around 2 and a half hours away on train and she doesn't feel comfortable talking a train on her own. I don't either tbf so we were supposed to meet up at a station and take the same train together. And do the same on the way back too. So just leaving when people start drinking means she'll have to take a two and a half hour long journey with multiple changes alone and she's afraid she will mess up. 

Update: it's been a while since all this happened around 3 pm yesterday and she's refusing to talk to me. But only me.

52,1d849xf,AITA for missing my friends Sweet 16?,"I've recently been debating posting here, but after having this issue stuck in my head, I couldn't help myself. For context, I (16F), have a best friend (15F), who we will call K. K and I have been friends for the last 10 years, give or take, and recently, I've noticed a lot of changes in her personality and actions. Especially when it comes to birthday parties in general, whether it's my own or others, think attention seeker.

We're actually going to dive back a little for some of these memories, because I'm appalled at how blind I was to even allow it to happen. (For reference, most will be centered around birthday parties and such)
At K‚Äôs 14th birthday, during presents, I had given K a self-drawn picture of herself, and a small necklace I thought was cute. Another one of my friends had gifted her similar artwork, which she praised. However, when she got to mine, and proceeded to belittle it and call it ""trashy"" even though most of my friends thought it was good (this was my first attempt, I was but sensitive). K has always had the habit of brushing off non-expensive gifts, and rarely puts any thought into the gifts she gives others.

Eventually, Halloween happened. My family was hosting a party that was kid-friendly. K showed up with possibly the most inappropriate costume for said party (it was around 40 degrees F). She dressed as sexy Pennywise, and waltzed around my house when there were children around the ages of 3-10 in the room. While I'm fine with her dressing up, I just wish she kept it more appropriate since the invitation stated ‚Äúkid friendly.‚Äù

Now we get to my Sweet 16/Quincea√±era, K had the #1 spot at my birthday table, and she showed up one hour late, missed my grand entrance + happy birthday, and then quickly left not even twenty minutes later. I will confirm that I still hold a grudge over this, as well as most of my family, and as you can probably assume, I was incredibly upset and it ruined my night just a bit. Especially since it was supposed to be a special celebration. 
Now, before I say anything else, I will admit I have missed K‚Äôs 15th, and will be missing her 16th. But at least I have justifiable reasons. For her 15th, I had a very bad case of strep throat, and had recently been treated for my 2nd case of COVID. K is still very upset I didn't attend and will often bring it up whenever she can.

A similar issue is with her Sweet 16 that I won‚Äôt be attending due to a pre-planned school trip from last year. I absolutely cannot cancel this trip due to my family already putting money into it and having all the deposits finalized recently.

K was pissed when I told her, and proceeded to ignore most of my messages when I tried to talk with her about it. She eventually called me a bunch of colorful phrases, and even called me an asshole for even trying to attend the trip instead of her Sweet 16, while also stating she‚Äôs been a good friend to me.

We also have two other littles ones in the house (2F & 1M). My husband's dad decided that he wanted to stay with us for the party. He brought his wife, my BIL, and my SIL. 

We were hosting almost 100 people in our house. I ordered most of the items we needed for hosting/serving purposes and had the food catered. All we needed to do on the day-of was move around our home to accommodate the tables/chairs/hosting equipment and set everything out. 

My FIL decided to spend most of the day in his room and away from the set up. His wife was constantly walking around and complaining about being asked to stay quiet since the baby was napping. As I was running around carrying large tables, moving furniture, decorating, watching children, etc. my husband's family was calling me mean names behind my back while also being no help at all- not even hanging out with the kids that they were supposedly there to see!

After the party, my family stuck around to help clean up. My husband's family also stuck around, apparently just to judge. My FIL, his wife, SIL, and BIL all stayed out of the way and napped while we cleaned up. My MIL and her husband sat around and watched my family clean up. After my MIL and her husband left (3 hours after the party ended) they were apparently talking about how weird it was that my family was helping and how gross it was that everything needed to be cleaned right away. They said that my kids are probably going to have problems as they grow up since I keep them in such a 'sterile' environment. My house is in NO WAY perfect, but after hosting that many people there is definitely some cleaning to do before letting 3 under 3 run around the house again!

I told my husband that his family is no longer allowed to stay with us when they're in town for events and they need to leave when the event is done. I'm tired of feeling judged in my own space. He says I'm being too harsh and that they're just not as 'clean' as we are. He thinks since they didn't actively hinder us and didn't make these comments directly to me, I should just brush it off. AITA?

Update #1 to answer some questions:

1) Yes, my husband did help with some set up. He also helped with taking down all of the rental items and getting them situated for pick up. He didn't get as much done as he could have as he would stop and talk with his family and have to be directed back to party setup/take down, but he wasn't just sitting with them.

2) A neighbor saw me struggling with setup. They came over to help. They overheard my FIL/BIL/SIL/FIL's wife talking about me which is how I found out. Afterwards when my family was cleaning up, they overheard the comments as they were going around the house. 

3) Yes, 100 people is a lot lol. Between both sides of immediate families, that was about 30 (both sides divorced with new partners and some additional children with their own children). Then with extended family (we get together for almost all the holidays and regularly for visits) it was another almost 40. There were only about 25 people not related to us, 7 kids from daycare and their families. It seemed easier to do it all at once rather than have a family birthday with ~70 and a friend birthday with ~30/having to be responsible for eight 2-3 year olds at a separate friend party. 

4) Yes, both sets of in laws are like this all the time. They both live in different parts of the country, so when we go to visit we stay at hotels. They've offered to let us stay with them, and before we had kids we would, but their homes would be so dirty that it was hard to enjoy ourselves. Think unwashed sheets on the guest bed, plates/cups that are rinsed but not washed after use, expired food being served, etc. It's not a suitable environment for children to stay in. Still, when we visit for events I am always the one helping with cleaning/cooking/etc. for the 'parties' they're hosting in their own homes. Part of this is to make sure I have clean things to eat off of and safe food to eat, but partially because I have been raised to be helpful! I wasn't necessarily surprised by their lack of help, but the rude comments caught me off guard!

My husband and I have a date night coming up this weekend and I plan to address this more then. I might not necessarily tell him that I brought it to the internet for debate, but there have been many helpful suggestions that I will use!",Not the A-hole,2024-06-04,"AITA for refusing to let my in laws stay with us again?

55,1d83am4,AITA for being stubborn ,"Ok guys lemme tell you what happened so I'm from india where respecting your parents is a very big thing. I'm a very stubborn child from the start and so is my dad (48 M). We love each other but often argue due to various reasons. So today what happened is that he teased me to the point that i got angry. He was teased me for not coming in his room today ( there is only 1 A.C room in our house and its hot in here). In the fits of anger i said that i wont be sleeping there today . He starts laughing and kept teasing me. Ok so after a while when he saw that i was not actually coming and my mum also told him to go and get me. He came to my room and told me to come and sleep in the A.C. room. I refused again and again. We starts to argue he told me if u dont come today you cant come ever. I said sure . I will never sleep in that room again no matter the temperature. So here im sleeping in my room is 50¬∞C. 

Ok, so i know that its not that serious and my dad  is very caring guy and loves me. And i know i took the matter a little too far and he was just teasing me. But i just want to know that am i too selfish to want my dad to understand that these things trigger my stubborness ( this has happened a lot where he tease me about something and then we argue and i refuse to do that particular thing) and stop doing that. And what hurts me the most that he laughs whenever im feeling frustrated or crying about anything.

56,1d838v7,AITA for getting my disappointed son a slurpee?,"My 8 year old son had a class trip yesterday. He was very excited in the days leading up to the trip mainly because of a specific attraction he was hoping to see. Unfortunately, the attraction is closed for renovations for the next couple of months, so he didn't get to see it. Though there were other things he liked and enjoyed, he was still super disappointed. When he got home, I asked him how the trip was, and he told me how disappointed he was that the thing he was most looking forward to wasn't available. I felt sorry for him- that sucks! And it was a nice day and we live 3 blocks away from a 7-11, so I offered to take him for a slurpee and he agreed. While it didn't make up for everything, it made his day a little bit better, and I was happy I could do that with such a simple little gesture.

Well, my husband thinks I was wrong because kids need to learn how to manage disappointment and I didn't give him that chance. I would agree if, say, I had taken him to Target and bought $100 worth of toys. Or, say, called the place and reamed them out for being disappointing. But it's just a slurpee, it costs a little over $1 and is close to home, so not some big production. It is in no way proportional to the disappointment, it was just a small thing to uplift his day a little. My husband argues that in ""the real world"" you just have to suck it up when disappointed, but I said that's not entirely true, adults in ""the real world"" absolutely treat themselves to minor things when they have a rough day. It wouldn't be an excuse to run up the credit card, but it is not crazy or unusual to get oneself a slurpee or a chocolate bar on a tough day. Anyway, just wondering who's right here?

57,1d836ey,AITA for expecting my flatmate friend to have my back when asked on a date by my crush?,"I (F25) have been living with Gia (F27) and Tony (M26) for three years. Over time, we've become close friends, sharing everything from dating stories to family issues and health scares. We‚Äôve supported each other through both good and bad times.

About a year ago, I met a new group of friends, including Dustin (M25), whom I quickly fancied. We share a similar background and have a great time together. Three months ago, I had a medical emergency, and Gia, my emergency contact, stayed with me at the hospital. Following this, Dustin began helping me out frequently, coming over almost every day to cheer me up during my recovery.

My flatmates noticed the growing closeness between Dustin and me and often discussed whether he might be romantically interested in me. Gia is always supportive, sometimes to the point where I wonder if she's just telling me what I want to hear, while Tony is more straightforward. Both convinced me that Dustin was into me, as he spent so much time with me and seemed to genuinely care about my well-being and theirs.

A month later, Dustin gave a weird excuse why he was not coming over to my place and another friend revealed that he was going on a date with a friend of Gia, who he met at a party I hosted. I felt quite stupid that I got so hyped up when I got home and found out that Gia knew about it since at least a week. Having this information was crucial to me so to come back from delulu land and manage my expectations of my relationship with Dustin! She said she thought it was not important since he was spending his time with me and promised to tell me everything from now on. I talked with Dustin, telling him that I was open to explore our connection also romantically and that my flatmates were shipping us together. He said that was aware he was getting my hopes up, that he loved spending time with me but that he was just being friendly, that is he a person that says yes to everything and quite insecure. This lowered a lot my opinion of him since he practically said that he just liked the attention and created some more for nothing. At least I finally knew. 

We agreed to keep being friends and got back to seeing each other less often, mostly with the group and came over just a couple times. When we met one-on-one, I treated him like a normal friend and told him about my new dates. These new boundaries worked for me and I was getting over the crush.¬†

Fast forward to this week. Dustin sees my profile on a dating app (I told him I liked his profile when I actually just exited the app when I saw it). The day after he bumps into Gia and point blank asks her out! She said she blanked and said yes, got his number and later asked me what what my feelings are about it before answering him. She says ""I don't want drama, I am telling you about it"" but is basically asking for permission to go out with him, when it's clear that I am not okay with it since just a month ago she was convincing me that he liked me. Also she put me in a super shitty position to ""forbid"" this date and makes me come off as controlling or jealous, when I am just hurt that she prefers having a date over our 3 years old friendship. If I were her I would have laughed it off and showed him that me and Gia are united friends and that is inappropriate to ask the best friend of the person it seemed he was pursuing out of all people. 

As long as she does questionable choices in her private life, I can only advice her for her sake, but now her lack of judgement is affecting my life and that is not tolerable. When we talked, she did not deny being interested in the date and said "" you know I hate confrontation so I said yes, I am like this and it's very difficult for me to say no"". Later she said she is not going out with him, but that came after I showed how upset I was about it. I believe her first reaction was actually telling what she really wants.

I don't know what to think as I did not get any indication that they were interested in each other until now. Assuming that they did not interact behind my back, I do not see what provoked this. 

AITA for expecting her to have our friendship as a higher priority over this problematic dude and decline the date invite right away? She asked me for permission instead of telling me about it to warm me about him not respecting me at all. She felt she was being a friend just because she told me about it. 

AITA for letting her see the consequences of her actions by being from now on just a polite flatmate to Gia, no longer confide or do any activity one on one with her? Is there any scenario where I should forgive her?

Why I'm Upset: 

- Gia already was shady to me when she kept silent about Dustin's date with her another friend, while she was hyping me up that he was into me. 

-Now the whole living situation feels awkward and uncomfortable. We have to live at least other 5 months together and later we were planning to move to another place together. I can't imagine doing it anymore. 

- I don't trust Gia anymore. She is not genuine about her feelings/thoughts. Maybe she liked him all along and maybe she recently gave him any indication of that. 

- This situation feels like a repeat of past experiences where close female friends ""stole"" guys I was interested in, which I had already confided in Gia about. 

- Also I already saw her being way too friendly to my ex boyfriend when we were together.

58,1d82y35,AITA for relying on an older sibling while babysitting?,"I'm 18f who just graduated high school a few weeks ago. I've never had a job before, and now that I‚Äôve graduated, I wanted to earn some money for experiences at community college. I asked my mom if she could help me find a job, and she suggested babysitting. I thought it would be easy.

My mom's supervisor needed a babysitter for the summer because their daycare shut down. They have two sons: Len, who's 10, and Bo, who's 5 and autistic. They reassured me that Len is very independent and prefers to be alone, so I would mostly need to focus on Bo. I‚Äôve never dealt with autistic kids, but I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard since he‚Äôs so young.

On my first day, I got to know the boys, and things started off pretty simple. Bo played with his toy cars for a few hours while Len stayed in his room. Around noon, I called them for lunch. I'm not great at cooking, so I just heated up some canned mac and cheese. Len was fine with it, but Bo burst into tears, saying he hated mac and cheese. I tried to get him to eat, but he kept crying.

Since I didn‚Äôt know much about autism, I asked Len for help. He was a bit rude but took Bo bowl, got him some fig bars, and that seemed to calm him down. When I asked Bo what he would like to eat in the future, he just made angry noises and ignored me.

Later, Bo started crying again because he couldn‚Äôt assemble his fire truck. He asked for help, and since I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I called Len again. Len complained and didn‚Äôt want to help, so I snapped and told him to help his brother or he wouldn‚Äôt get a snack later. He did it grudgingly, and things were fine for a while.

Some time passes, and I find Bo crying in the laundry room again. He told me his cat scratched him and made him bleed. I called Len again to put a band-aid on him because I wasn‚Äôt sure how Bo would react if I did it. Len looked really upset while doing it, but nothing else happened that day.

When their mom came home, I left. Later, I got a long, angry message saying I ""parentified"" Len and that it should‚Äôve been my responsibility to take care of Bo. She said she didn‚Äôt want me to babysit anymore. I was livid because I feel like Len is very spoiled and can‚Äôt even handle helping out around the house.

My mom is mad at me, but my dad is on my side and is really angry with their mom.

59,1d82v1v,AITA for not allowing my ex‚Äôs father to see her in hospital?,"Not in the US

I (28M) have a 5 year old with my ex girlfriend Emma (24F). We split after two years together and regrettably weren‚Äôt on speaking terms until recently. 

Emma was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago and we started speaking again for the sake of our son. We also got closer and I would consider us to be friends now. 

I take her for her chemo appointments and she‚Äôs given me some very strict instructions on what i‚Äôm supposed to do for her in case she‚Äôs unable to make decisions for herself. One of these decisions is to not let her father into her hospital room unless she explicitly states I can or it‚Äôs an emergency. They have a very strained relationship due to him ignoring her for years after her parents split. He also refused to meet our son for 2 years because he was a ‚Äòbastard‚Äô (emma and I weren‚Äôt married). 

Unfortunately, she was admitted into hospital two days ago after an episode with her heart. I informed her family of it (she asked me to in advance). I told her mother and somehow the news got back to her father. 

A few relatives came to visit and when they left, a nurse informed us that her father was here. At that point, Emma was sleeping and I told the nurse the situation and she told emma‚Äôs father that visiting hours were over. Unfortunately, he found the real visiting hours online and demanded to be let in. I went out to try and mediate but the situation ended with him being removed by security.

Emma has been very weak since then so I haven‚Äôt worried her by telling her about what‚Äôs happening since she needs all her energy to feel better. 

However, a lot of her paternal family are berating me and Emma‚Äôs brother said I was the AH since Emma wouldn‚Äôt have even known their father was there since she was asleep. He said that since Emma and her father‚Äôs relationship is bad, he‚Äôs afraid of her passing away (thankfully she is nowhere near that sick) without them making amends and I should have let him at least see his daughter since they haven‚Äôt seen eachother in years.

I‚Äôm starting to feel bad about this situation but I know that Emma explicitly told me not to let him since. Since the incident, he has been barred from the hospital. My friends are saying that letting him come and see her for a few minutes while she was asleep would have done no harm.

60,1d82ll7,AITA for telling my brother he's wrong to blame his ex wife without any evidence simply because he doesn't want to consider other possibilities?,"My brother has a 7 year old son with his ex . They divorced 2 years ago and my brother is now remarried. My brother and his ex share custody of their son. SIL has been in their lives for 18 months and living with them for 10 months. In March my nephew had to draw his family for school. He drew his mom, his maternal grandparents, my brother and me, my husband and our daughter. He did not draw SIL. My brother and SIL quizzed him on this and he said SIL isn't his family so he didn't draw her. They told him that was wrong and SIL is his family, she's his bonus mommy and he has two moms now and not just one. My nephew told them no and he ran to his room crying. He didn't change the drawing or add SIL to it.

My brother immediately blamed his ex for this. He decided there was no way my nephew could just not like SIL or not be close enough to her yet to count her, it had to be his ex. This led to him starting a fight with her and filing for full custody but they never made it to court because his reasoning was weak. My brother and SIL decided my nephew needed counseling and got him in after a month and after one or two sessions Mother's Day came and went and there was another ""incident"" because my nephew didn't call SIL on Mother's Day or make her anything. This was also nephew's mom's fault according to my brother.

Then last week my brother spoke to the counselor my nephew sees and she told him she didn't believe his ex was involved in this. He dismissed her opinion and came to vent to me. He basically shut out what the counselor said because he wants to believe his ex is to blame. I told him he's wrong to blame his ex without any proof and he should be open to other possibilities for why my nephew feels the way he does. He told me I'm stupid and naive if I think it's not his ex and he explained how amazing SIL is and how it can't be her fault (I never claimed it was). He asked what kind of sister I am when I side with his ex over him.

61,1d82kad,WIBTA if I tell my gf(21f) of 3 years to not take a big chance from me(20m) to herself. How Can i fix this?,"Hey everyone, I (20M) need some advice on a tough situation with my girlfriend (21F) of almost 3 years now.

About 4 months ago, my girlfriend's behavior was really hurtful. She did a lot of stuff i can't get over mentally. She yelled and swore at me in front of friends, colleagues and in public, calling me names and putting me down. On top of that, there was a fully funded travel opportunity related to some event I'd been looking forward to for a long time (I've been preparing for this for exactly a year every single day I'd work to apply for it). Unfortunately, things didn't work out due to her actions at said event related to the trip. It got so bad, I just couldn't handle it and left. Now, she's done applying to go in my place.

Honestly, I don't mind that she gets to go instead of me (in the sense that I don't care if I went or not. I'm just upset in the sense that she's going (if it was anyone else who went instead of her id be fine with it) but the fact she acted like this and then gets the chance to travel). It's more the feeling of unfairness. She acted terribly and now gets this kind of like reward? She's apologized, but blames me for missing the trip. While she's this morning offered to cancel if it makes me feel better, that feels like punishing both of us.

Here's the thing: I'm really struggling with this. It's affecting my mental and physical health. I get headaches, and my blood pressure is up as I've been planning this for the both of us for a year, a year of a lot of effort, a huge amount of studying and working on myself every single day. I don't know what to do. Should I:

1. Tell her not to go and try to work things out (therapy, communication, or even break up with her)?
2. Encourage her to go and not be ""selfish"" (even though it hurts)?

We're both from low-income families and this was a scholarship, so I wouldn't want to deprive her of this chance. But the idea of her going and me seeing the pictures...it makes me feel really angry, sad, and kind of pathetic.

Before I do anything rash, I'd really appreciate some advice. Thanks in advance.",TL;DR,2024-06-04,"WIBTA if I tell my gf(21f) of 3 years to not take a big chance from me(20m) to herself.

He says that we need to move on and accept it because we're all old enough. We feel like he's choosing her over us. Are we unreasonable for this?

Edit for more info: I recently had a baby on their daughter's (my half sister's) birthday, and she (dad's girlfriend) bought me diapers, wipes, several lotions and outfits for him. My younger sisters have gone to her (their) house several times and lunch with my dad and her, and her other son from another marriage. My older sister has even gone with them to dinner. She's never done anything malicious to any of us, we just feel uncomfortable around her. We dont want to see our dad with someone other than our mother. I'm sure she feels uncomfortable to a certain extent, but doesn't show it. 
There were problems between my mom and dad for many years before they finally separated. My dad left several times before and my mom even moved in with her parents for months at one point. My father wanted to reconcile with my mom but she did not want to get back together and likes it just being us girls in the house. My older sister lives with her boyfriend so it's just me, my baby, my mom, and younger sisters in the house. It's peaceful now and no more tension and we still want to see our dad, just not with her.

67,1d81ndu,AITA for how I reacted to my spouse leaving a mess after using my new espresso machine and banning him from using it? ,"My SO (30) got me (30) an espresso machine for my birthday, which I have been wanting for many years. On my birthday, he was so excited he started opening the (unwrapped, not that this matters but just clarifying that he didn't unwrap anything) espresso machine before I even had a chance too and I had to gently joke/remind him that I would like to unbox them myself. 

Yesterday was the first day that we used the machine. I was excited to use it, and made a few drinks for us, and he made one too. He kept offering to make me a latte and I had to remind him that I would like to try it out since I just got it.

Today, I woke up and went to use it finding a mess of coffee grinds and water all over the counter and accessories. I know he had an appointment to get to and he took the dogs out so I could sleep in. I cleaned up the mess and made my coffee, as I'm steaming the milk, he asks me if I filled the milk to the line and reminds me there is a max and minimum line on the cup and that it looks overfilled. NGL I got annoyed at this as I used it multiple times yesterday and he saw me reading the directions. I feel like he talks to me like I'm dumb or a child, like bc he used it once he is the expert even though I made him a latte yesterday and we have had the machine the same amount of time. I have also used my mom's espresso machine and steamed milk on it, whereas he has never done that before. Also, I don't go up to him when he's cooking and ask if I knows how to turn on the oven and if he knows there are different temperatures. Just feels condescending.

When he came home, he made himself another coffee. I go to make my second drink and again there is a mess of grinds and water everywhere. I became frustrated because it's my second day with this new gift and I want to be able to use it without having to clean up after him. 

He was in the restroom when I found the mess so I texted him: ""I would really appreciate it you cleaned up after yourself. I already cleaned up the ground coffee and water after you left this morning. If this is going to be another area that I have to clean up after you use it, then you're not allowed to use it.""

 I feel like I have to come behind him a lot to keep stuff tidy as he has ADHD.

We got into a heated argument bc he started getting defensive saying I didn't give him a chance to clean it and I should be nicer with my approach as I cause him to be defensive. I feel like my stuff is always our stuff and his stuff is his, and I'm tired of not having my stuff respected. Whenever this gets brought up he basically says that I just have a bad case of only child syndrome. So AITA for banning him from using it if he can't clean up after himself?

Keep in mind that she allowed me to eat whatever I wanted there. One of the few things in her fridge was this chocolate egg. Here where I live, easter chocolate eggs are a bit fancier, with fillings and stuff, so it‚Äôs kind of expensive. But anyway, I was hungry and I ate it. That was probably a week ago. Fast forward to yesterday, my friend returned from her trip and everything was fine. She didn‚Äôt mention the egg at all. However, a few hours later, this friend of hers sends me a DM on Instagram. Basically the chocolate egg was hers and she was pissed that I ate it without asking. She was also pissed because, apparently, a couple of months ago she also left a chocolate box at this friend‚Äôs house and I ate it all, which wasn‚Äôt the case, we were all eating together and I had no idea it was hers.

She apologized and agreed next time it‚Äôs her turn. Next time came and at the end of the meal she started texting frantically and told me there was an emergency at home with her dog and she needed to leave right at that moment.

Later I texted her to ask how her dog is (not well unfortunately) and sent a digital request for the price of half the meal (not in the same message but around the same time.) 

This upset her and she let me know it‚Äôs insensitive of me to ask her for money while she is caring for her sick dog. I apologized and left it alone but it‚Äôs been two weeks and she has not sent her half. 

Today she texted asking if I want to go out to lunch and I responded I could if she sent the previous payment request. She ignored it and avoided me at lunch time

77,1d80cf3,AITA for keeping the bathroom door locked?,"(Throwaway because on the off chance my flatmate sees this I really don‚Äôt want him connecting it to my main account)

I (M22) live with a good friend of mine (M21) who I met in university, who we‚Äôll call Aaron. Aaron and I get along exceptionally well and have been sharing an apartment since October 2023. This is my first time sharing an apartment with someone (I was in university boarding until now) and it‚Äôs going super great overall‚Äî I was worried we‚Äôd end up having some major differences but everything has been going smoothly and I really enjoy living with him. 

There‚Äôs just one issue and I feel like maybe I‚Äôm making a big deal but it‚Äôs just kind of weird to me. We have one bathroom, which is one of those combo bathrooms that includes the toilet as well as shower, sink etc. When the door locks, it clicks very loudly and can be heard outside the room. I always lock the door when I‚Äôm using the bathroom because that‚Äôs just what feels comfortable to me, but apparently Aaron disagrees. A couple of months after moving in he made an offhand comment about how I didn‚Äôt need to lock the door each time, since he obviously won‚Äôt open it when I‚Äôm in there. At the time I thought he was joking so I sort of laughed it off.

Since then, though, he‚Äôs brought it up multiple times. Once I realised he wasn‚Äôt joking I told him I just preferred to have it locked just in case, and that otherwise I think I would feel too vulnerable while ‚Äúdoing my business‚Äù. He said it shouldn‚Äôt matter either way, since he would never open the door anyway. I told him I know that but I just like having it locked. I think he interpreted that as me not trusting him or something, because he looked kind of hurt and offended.

To be clear he hasn‚Äôt tried to pressure me into keeping the door unlocked and I think it‚Äôd be weird if he did. But every so often when I‚Äôm done using the bathroom he‚Äôll joke about it but with this expression that looks like he‚Äôs actually still a bit hurt. It feels like he thinks me locking the bathroom door is a sign I don‚Äôt trust him to keep his word.

I have to stress that Aaron is a great guy and other than this we have no issues.

79,1d7zz2d,AITA for keeping my best friend,"Back story: I, 25f, have a best friend, 24m. We've known each other for 5 years. We dated for a brief period over a year ago and decided we needed different things from a relationship and we were better as friends. He has gotten me through some of my worst times. He is a key component in my support system which is very small. (I only have 2 true friends including him)

Fast forward to my recent relationship with, we'll call him Jake. We met about 6 months ago. It was a whirlwind romance. Fell in love immediately. He knew about my best friend AND our history and was fine with it. Over the course of a few months, Jake completely changed. He went from sweet and loving to vindictive and cruel. He suddenly decided he was no longer ok with my friend being in the picture. To appease him, I willingly blocked my friend knowing it was my last attempt to make the relationship work. Not long after, he was abusing one of his medications and got me kicked out of my house. He had gone into psychosis due to the med and I had to lock him out for a brief period to protect myself and my daughter. He was screaming through the door. Neighbors called management and we were asked to vacate. I had to move back in with my mom. He came with me but he only got meaner and meaner so a couple weeks after getting to my mom's we broke up and I sent him home to his mom's to work on his issues and get the help he needs. I unblocked my best friend at this point because the relationship was over. 
Last week Jake's mom got arrested for dv against him and she evicted him when she got out. He had nowhere to go and, in trying to be kind, I allowed him to come back to my mom's with very clear boundaries including the fact that we are not together and I would continue to have my friends and go to work and take care of my child in the way I had been for the last month and a half since we had broken up. He agreed to all of my boundaries. 
Last night he brought up my friend and said I was disrespectful for continuing to be friends with someone I had a past with. I don't agree with him but I have to ask...AITA?


Edit to add:

Jake is only a danger when he is on his meds and one of the boundaries I set with him returning was that he would speak to his doctor about the fact that he cannot control himself on the med and get switched to something less addictive. He cannot get those meds anywhere near my house so I would have to drive him an hour away for him to have access to them and he knows I will not do that because it puts us in danger. Another boundary is that he will start therapy and if he's not willing to help himself then he will not be welcome at my home. It sounds horrible to say I allowed him back but my boundaries did include his behavior and addiction issues. My parents are both social workers.

now i am just avoiding coming over to see them because im worried there might be awkwardness.  i wouldn‚Äôt exactly say that his parents are upset at me but they definitely thought that i crossed a line or was rude. 

thank you if you read this till the end. üòÉüôèüèº",0.0,1.0177853107452393,1,0
82,1d7zh5u,AITA for expecting more of my depressed/anxious sister? ,"Im the younger sister (26) to my older sister (28) are we close and love each other, but come from a family where we hardly learned to communicate calmly or take care of ourselves. 

My sister has depression and anxiety and it got really bad 5 years ago, but she never wanted to get therapy. Ive gotten therapy to deal with her and her depression over the years. Im her closest friend, and Ive realised that Im exhausted of empathy from her confiding in me. She says she doesnt want to pay to talk to someone and that its depressing that she has no one to talk to. And she says, if youre not feeling good imagine how Im feeling?

In general I repeatedly and clearly place boundaries with her which she completely ignores, even when I explain that Im drained and resentful and devoid of empathy. 

Lately weve been in a better place,  she comes over to my apartment and she stays for a while  (4-6 days) because she hates being at our parents home, and prefers being in the city. 

The latest event yesterday that triggered us:

We were sitting down and she was getting hungry at lunch time. There wasnt ready groceries in the fridge so she started complaining angrily and accusing me of never ‚Äúthinking ahead and planning for food‚Äù. 

I got triggered because, its not true, and is it only my responsibility to feed us? I cooked fish and salad the previous night with no help from her, the usual.

She rarely cooks and cleans at our parents where she lives, and didnt maintain healthy habits when she used to live alone. 

She usually orders in fastfood to feed herself. She wanted to order pokebowls, but it was 25$ each and she wouldnt pay for my part. It was too expensive.. Although, When I go grocery shopping and I pay for both of our meals for the week, she is very comfortable eating ‚Äúfree‚Äù food that appears in the fridge.

I know she was relying on me to cook as usual. So I said, are you relying on me?  What would you do if I wasnt here? She said no shes not relying on me. But what are we gonna eat. She was looking at recipes and asked me what Id want to eat. I said chicken, veggies. She wanted pasta, burger. We disagreed and she got even more mad because I always ‚Äòjust want chicken‚Äô. .. We had fish and lentils before that... 

I was frustrated with her attitude and was giving her short replies. So it escalated into a screaming match because apparently I was rude to her by not helping figure out lunch.

Im tired of doing all the work. I ended up doing the groceries by myself, and she did do the dishes which took 10mins, and I happily thanked her for it. But when I later asked for help with cooking she called me ungrateful.

She struggles with basic things and I know its hard with anxiety/depression. Am I the asshole here for resisting to give my all, and expecting more of her?

83,1d7zci7,AITA for blowing up at my fianc√© for not turning the gas stove off,"My fianc√© (27M) and I (27F) work from home.
Both of us have 9 to 5 jobs and work from home on all days. 
We have equally busy schedules but I would cook on most days and we would take turns in cleaning/maintaining the house. He does the dishes. 
He takes scares of things like being the bills on time, maintaining the car. 

Around three months ago, he had a very busy schedule at work, and I offered to help by cooking on all days and taking charge of cleaning the apartment and maintaining the apartment. However, his work routine is back to normal, but he hasn‚Äôt taken a responsibility of his usual chores yet. I‚Äôm still doing all of the cooking, cleaning, vacuuming.

He usually falls the laundry, but it‚Äôs been weeks and the laundry still hasn‚Äôt been folded.

Today morning I had put some food on the stove and had to go for a work meeting. I gave him specific instructions on when to turn the gas off. But when I got done with my call, I opened my office door and I got a strong burning smell. When I went to the kitchen, I saw that the gas wasn‚Äôt turned off and everything had burnt.

I was furious. I lashed out on him and told him that I‚Äôm sick and tired of him not doing anything at home. I yelled and shouted and told him that his contribution is zero and I just can‚Äôt take this anymore.

I banged my door and went back to my home office.

We haven‚Äôt since and I‚Äôve got some time to calm down. I feel like I might‚Äôve been too harsh on him, but at the same time, I need him to realize that he needs to pick up his slack of things and starts needing to get back to contributing at home.

When I now went out of my room to get some water, I saw that he had got me coffee and had left it on my seat in the dining table. I felt a jab of guilt, but don‚Äôt want to soften up.


So Reddit, AITA for lashing out on him just because he forgot to turn the gas off? Should I apologize to him?

1. I blew up because making lunch and dinner in the morning isn‚Äôt ideal, give the crazy work schedule. He had ONE JOB - to turn off the gas, which he said he will. The fact that he couldn‚Äôt do that and I wasted my last hour for nothing was insane.

2. Honestly I wasn‚Äôt so angry about him forgetting to turn off the stove, but the fact that I‚Äôve been doing EVERYTHING (laundry, meals, cleaning, etc) since the last few months just got to me.

3. My love language is act of service, so I‚Äôve let this slide for too long. But what gets to me is that if I ask for a small thing when he‚Äôs sitting ideally and chilling- his response is that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt let me sit for a minute‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre always giving me things to do‚Äù which is insane.

85,1d7z6gi,WIBTA if I progress further in a hobby I share with my wife than she can right now?,"My wife and I got into a watersport-based hobby during Covid. The hobby is broken into different levels with different certifications, kind of like belts in martial arts. At pretty much every level, you must pass a progressively harder swim test.

I have a LONG history of swimming. I was on swim teams during High School and my parents would take me to the beach or pool almost every weekend during the summers. My wife had basically 0 swimming experience. She was unable to tread water, submerge herself, or swim laps.

I passed the very first class very easily while my wife struggled with the swim test. We worked together for a few weekends and eventually she was able to pass it (the swim test was to simply tread water in the ocean for 10 minutes).

As we progress through the ""levels"" of our hobby, the swim tests become more and more difficult. We are now approaching the ""professional"" levels of this activity, where we will become instructors/coaches. My wife is absolutely struggling with the swim tests at this level. We have basically hit a standstill in our combined progression because it is clear she is nowhere near ready to pass the next test (the professional levels have MUCH stricter/harder swim tests).

Up to this point, we have completed all classes for promotion together. We have been training in the gym pool together around 15 times a month. Yesterday she mentioned to me yesterday that it is CLEAR that I could easily progress to the professional level (the test gives me absolutely no problems), but she just cannot even get half-way to passing right now.

I suggested maybe achieving my professional certification on my own so we can get our foot in the door in the industry and she instantly got upset and said she wanted us to do it together. The class is 7 days long and would requires travel to another location. She really hated that idea and believed I was abandoning her by suggesting to do it by myself.

Becoming a professional in this hobby would open doors for BOTH of us, supplement our income, and get us one step closer towards our ultimate goal of doing this for a living. My wife will continue to be my partner in this hobby, obviously. I would absolutely support my wife to go as far in any hobby as she can, but I feel as though my wife resents that I have been progressing with very little challenge until this point while she struggles.

I love training with my wife, and I'm so proud of the hard work she has put in to get this far. I honestly think she has been working WAY harder than I have given her circumstances.

GF ( 29F) and I (31M) have been together for a little less than 9 years. About 3 months ago we had a conversation about how much we‚Äôve grown apart over our relationship and how we don‚Äôt really share any common interests anymore. Having had this conversation we decided that the best thing for us to do was to live together until our lease is up and then part ways as a couple, ending the relationship. Things are extremely civil between us and we‚Äôre both on the same page. 

Our landlord requires us to notify her of any changes in the lease in June (our lease is up the end of September). This is context for later. 

For the last few months I have been talking to GF about who is going to live in the apartment once the other leaves. I was under the impression it would always be me since I make more money than she does and can afford it more easily. I would drop comments in conversation about making a decision and always got ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it right now‚Äù in response. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. GF says she wants to keep the apartment instead of me. She states that it‚Äôs close to her storage unit and she can swing it if she gets a roommate. Okay. No problem. I start looking for comparable apartments in the area. I‚Äôm not sweating it though because there‚Äôs plenty of time before our lease is up. And, worst comes to worst, I can move in with my parents for a few months as a cushion. 

In the middle of looking one day GF comes to me and says she changed her mind. I can have the apartment. I am happy of course and stop looking. 

Then, after being away for a weekend with some friends GF and I are laying in bed. It is 12:15am the night before we were planning on texting the landlord to let her know what is going on. At the end of a sentence GF asks ‚Äúcan I stay in the apartment?‚Äù I tell her of course, she‚Äôs welcome to stay as long as she needs to find a new place. She says, ‚Äúno like can you move out and I stay?‚Äù I immediately look at her and shut this down immediately. She tells me that she ‚Äúwon‚Äôt change her mind again‚Äù and I tell her that‚Äôs not the issue here. The issue is that she has had months to figure this out and has flip flopped back and forth multiple times within the last few weeks. 

I continued to hold the boundary of no, I am staying. I texted the landlord the next day telling her as much and agreed to help GF find a new place. AITA here or just feeling guilty?

91,1d7yceb,AITA for causing my sister to quit her job?,"This has been bothering me for years. My (50F) sis (36F) needed a job. I was a manager at a small company and we were hiring. I knew she had a history of quitting without notice and suing at least one employer. I talked to her about it then helped her get a job at my company. She was hired by another manager, then promoted to work for me a year later. She was amazing at her job, everyone loved her, and she and I grew really close. The difference in our ages and living far apart as stopped us from being close before.

She worked for the company for 3 years. Her child was about to start kindergarten and my sis told me she needed a week off. No prob. Then she called me and said she needed a family leave of absence. I asked her what was going on and I wanted to help. She said she would request it in writing. The next day she sent me a resignation email that was effective immediately. I tried to call her many times but she never answered. This is the last time she ever spoke to me - the resignation email. 

I asked our mom what was going on, but she didn‚Äôt know. Weeks went by and I called my sister a few times, but she never answered then changed her number. 

A year later, my sis applied for a job at a new company with her first manager, my friend. My friend told me she would interview her but wanted an explanation for why she quit without notice. I called my mom to warn my sis. My mom started crying and told me she was sworn to secrecy, but when my sis took that first week off to get her kid in school, others at work asked me why she was taking a week.  I do not remember it but do not doubt it is true. Apparently, I explained to others how my sis is overprotective.  No one, not even my parents, had ever been alone with the kids. She used leashes in public. That the transition to school was going to be hard on her. This embarrassed my sis so much, she told my mom that she just couldn‚Äôt face our coworkers again. 

My friend did not rehire her - quitting without notice was too risky.  My sis never told my friend the reason.  Since then, I received a request for an recomendation for my sis for a new job. I was angry that she hadn‚Äôt asked me but gave her a glowing rec anyway. I want her to be employed (mostly so she stops taking money from my parents). 

I was wrong to say anything personal at work. It has been 4 years.

93,1d7y1qd,AITA for refusing to help rekindle my girlfriend‚Äôs friendship with our neighbour after she refused to help her in an emergency?,"My (25f)‚Äôs girlfriend (26f-Lotta) has always been on the more quiet and reserved side but also incredibly kind and conscientious of other people. She also doesn‚Äôt let others walk over her and knows how to set (and stick to) boundaries which is one of the reasons I was attracted to her. But a few weeks ago, I think she was too ruthless.

A few weeks ago, our upstairs neighbour (who Lotta and I are close with) showed up at our door sobbing and begging Lotta to babysit her 5 year old for an hour because her one month old was having trouble breathing and has stopped breathing at one point and needed to go to the hospital ASAP. The neighbour explained her mother was on the way as they speak but she has no one else to take care of her other son. She also offered to pay Lotta. I was at work at the time.

Lotta said no. She said she was busy and couldn‚Äôt do it. The neighbour ended up taking both kids to the hospital. I found out about this incident when I got home from work and Lotta told me. I was genuinely surprised to hear she said no which seemed to annoy Lotta.

Its been 3 weeks since that event and our neighbour has been quite cold to Lotta and this really bothers her. She says she was just setting boundaries and that our neighbour was entitled and snobby for being upset that Lotta said no. I explained I felt differently and am more on our neighbour's side as 1) she has never asked us for any favours in the 3 years we've known her and 2) this was a medical emergency- not her wanting to go clubbing with her friends. I told Lotta that she didn't teach our neighbour a lesson,, she only added stress she didn't need.

This really upset Lotta because she thought I would be on her side. She then asked me to talk to our neighbour to try and rekindle their friendship. I said I can't do that for her, she needs to apologise herself and put in the work.

Lotta stormed off and now keeps saying I'm being a huge asshole for not siding with her and helping her with our neighbour who is 'her friend'.

It's a fairly small apartment, thankfully me and my brother both have our own room. However my mom doesn't, she sleeps and lives in the living room/kitchen. To get from mine and my brother's rooms to the bathroom, toilet and front door you have to cross the living room/kitchen, which means that my mom has basically zero privacy at home. She has complained about this (lockdown was very rough), but right now we don't really have the means to move.

2.5 years ago she switched jobs and met her current partner(36M), who I'll call Claude. Claude is probably one of the most patient people I've ever met and as far as I can tell really loves my mom. Which kind of became a problem: he basically lives with us now. He is unwilling to separate from my mom, unless he \*really\* has to. He started frequenting our apartment 3 months into the relationship and even then I didn't take it very well. I have audhd and this period was super rough for me, my brother was also less than impressed but he fared way better. My mom and I had a long conversation and she ""promised"" that once they patched up Claude's 2br apartment, they'd stay over there more. 

It's been almost 2 years since they ""patched up"" Claude's apartment and this has not happened. He sleeps over 6 nights a week, the remaining 1 night they both sleep over at his place. My mom dislikes his place and does not feel at home there, which is understandable. She is very introverted, misses her ""alone time"" a lot and is very clearly getting more and more fed up with Claude sticking to her like an Octopus. Most of the time he's over they don't even really talk, she's trying to do her own things and he's on their sofa/bed on the tablet or phone.

She has talked to Claude about this and the guy just doesn't get it. In the end mom always drops the conversation because it's exhausting and feels bad for Claude. The 2 times she stood her ground were the 2 weeks where Claude didn't sleep over 6 nights a week in the past 1.5 years. The last time happened over 2 months ago, and for those 2 days she was \*so happy\*. After that she said she talked with Claude, and said that he'll come over less frequently.

Last sunday my mom asked him to sleep at his place alone, and it turned into an argument (Claude, flabbergasted ""You're telling me to let you be alone and lonely?"") and in the end mom gave in and Claude stayed. But mom is not taking it well, she's been very moody and snappy and clearly needs a day alone.

My mom doesn't like conflicts at all and at the rate things are going I don't think our sanity or their relationship for that matter will survive. And this is where I might be the asshole: I want to try to talk to Claude regarding the situation and explain to him that 

1) the apartment is too small for 3 grown people, let alone 4

2) \*I\* feel uncomfortable that he's over so much (genuinely nothing personal, I'd feel that way with my own partner and like. basically anyone)

3) introverted people exist, and being alone doesn't mean being lonely

4) even if he doesn't understand that, at the very least he should respect my mom's wishes

I (21F) live with my flatmate (22F) in an all-girls dorm where we have separate rooms but share a living room. I'm a med student, so I study all the time. My flatmate is graduating soon and spends most of her day watching Netflix. She's a heavy sleeper, and her alarm goes off for hours every morning.

We usually get along fine because I'm always studying in my room. She knows it's finals season and that I'll be moving back with my parents for summer soon. Recently, she was watching Netflix at 3 AM in the living room, which is right outside my door. It was so loud that I couldn't concentrate, so I texted her to lower the volume, but she ignored me. I then asked her in person, and she lashed out, saying things like, ""Can I fucking live in this house that I pay for too?"" and she claimed I‚Äôm ‚Äúextra sensitive to voices‚Äù and that I always ask her to do that.

I told her I always ask because she‚Äôs always disturbing me and that I have exams. I suggested she watch in her room if she wants it loud.

From Oct2022 to all of 2023, intermittently their dog goes out at random times of the day, sometimes 5-6am, barks very loudly near the stairs (thus very close to my door just outside my room). It would wake me up, fuck my sleep and mood up. I complained a lot to the landlord, and thus it has been reduced significantly but not completely.

There was one time where the dog came into my room while my door was open bec I was cooking. The dog jumped to my bed and peed. I got very furious, my neighbors washed my bedding (but the pee on the matress unfortunately was still there). Just the other day it came into my room again as I opened my door. Yesterday I posted a paper note in front of their door to call them out, and apparently they got offended and felt disrespected that I did that instead of confronting them; I am very introverted and I don't like confronting people.

Just tonight, they let the dog out for a good few minutes as if intentionally just to taunt my paper posting. I went out my room, called the the fck out and raised my voice. It was a heated, emotional, half-sensical discussion where I say my complaint and the neighbor would just say back why it's still justified and that I also have some fault and that I have to understand that they can't control their dog.

I eventually realized that I had to talk kindly for them to be able to accept my appeal and it worked, but I'm not sure how much of it was actually true rather than just them trying to appear decent. It ended up more calmly than it started, but now I can't settle my mind as I've done something horrible by creating that commotion.

My brain is not working right now and I need some clarity on whether I was at fault or my getting mad and loud was justified.

Imagine having to get your sleep randomly fucked up and be surprised early in the morning for over a year.

100,1d7wyp8,AITA for not letting my step-nephew spend time at my house anymore?,"My brother Nick (35m) is married to Rachel (34f) and is stepdad to her son Colton (9m). Rachel and her ex split custody of Colton so he's at their house 50% of the time and the other 50% he's with his dad's family. Something that is kinda relevant is Nick does not play an active parenting role in Colton's life. He's basically the backup, the fun uncle figure, but parenting is only between Rachel and her ex and Nick is not allowed to discipline Colton or handle parenting matters. So I have been dealing with Rachel alone on this issue.

I have two boys. My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 4. Because my oldest and Colton are so close in age Rachel wanted them to spend as much time together as possible and she asked if we could take Colton after school in an informal agreement. We had agreed he could come to my house until 5pm but when it came into practice, he would be here until 7pm or later and Rachel never picked Colton up before then even if I called.

Colton was taught that if you're in a family members home you can take what you like and don't have to ask. So while he was in my house he eat and drink so much of our stuff. In one day before he drank an entire 6 pack of Sprite that he went outside to get, a big share bag of Doritos, three chocolate bars, a bag of gummy candies and cookies I had left out of the way for later. I spoke to him and said he should ask before taking in the future and he told me he didn't need to ask and his mom said he should eat when he wants to. I talked to Rachel about this and she scolded me for bringing this to Colton at all. She said if it's in my house he should be able to eat or drink as much of it as he likes.

There was also the added fact that he was here for dinnertime and I couldn't just let him sit there day after day and watch us eat so I started making enough for him too but then he'd take the things he liked off my sons plates and he'd leave what he didn't like (veggies and meats usually unless nuggets). Again this was a conflict with Rachel because I told Colton not to do it and tried to make him apologize. Colton told Rachel about it and she was pissed off at me for trying to discipline her son.

I tried for a few weeks but it wasn't working and so I pulled the plug on him being here. And now I say no and I have told her he can't spend time at my house anymore. Rachel told me if he was my real nephew I wouldn't dismiss Colton so quickly. She also told me I'm taking my issues with her out on him and he's sad he can't spend time with his bestie cousin anymore.

103,1d7wsph,AITA for wearing the same shirt from the first week of my internship again?,"Some context:

So recently I (19N) started a really good summer internship via my mom's connections. The pay is nothing too crazy but I get an hour lunch and have to do very little physical labour (which is good since I'm in the process of trying to get my knee checked out at the doctor). And the benefits I'd have if i landed a permanent job here would be amazing.

Though to be honest I'm just glad to have a job at this point as I was unemployed for two months and felt it severely because I'm in college and paying for most of my own bills.  

My only means of getting to this job is either at least an hour and a half of catching the bus or getting a 20 minute ride from my mother. So the choice for how i want to get to work is obvious, especially since I have to be to work for 8:30 a. m. 

The problem is that my mother is very judgemental about how i look and how i present myself to the world. I'm in her words ""a young woman and should look and act as such"". She used to accept that i looked and dressed was on the more masculine side of things when i was younger but has seemingly reverted to being more conservative about those things as time went on. Now she body and fat shamed me saying to both me and her friend continuously that she wasn't this fat when she was my age and that i needed to drop a few pounds (I'm 5'7 and weigh 185 lbs) before dropping me to work on my first day.

She continuously tries to stress me out before dropping me to work and  everyday no matter what I do she has to find fault with something about my appearance. One morning it was her saying that I should never go to work without wearing perfume and then a few mornings later she's saying that you shouldn't always go to work smelling the same (which is wrong??? it's called a signature smell iirc) and threatened to make me walk to work if I didn't use her perfume instead (it smelt horrible to me and wouldnt fade the entire day. it made me feel a bit gross ngl).

So back to the question at hand. My mother believes that nothing that I wore the first week of my internship, except maybe the work pants, should be worn again until next week at minimum. She says that I should just borrow some of her clothes and stop making myself (and her by association) look broke. The thing is though that we kinda are! We're middle class trying to make more of ourselves both with small businesses (hers established and my own is just getting started). 

Does wearing a shirt once a week really speak of brokeness? And if so then so what?

105,1d7we29,AITA for not helping out my half brother financially,"Not in the US

When I (23f) was 15, my dad cheated on my mom. It was a messy divorce and hurted me deeply as they always had a loving marriage. My mom sank into depression and was emotionally unavailable for me. My paternal grandfather stepped in and forced my dad to transfer most of his valuables/properties and money under my name, with grandfather acting as my guardian (grandmother passed when I was 11). 

My dad had a well paying job so he was able to more or less maintain the same lifestyle. He married his affair partner Kim a year after the divorce. My custody was 50/50 between dad and mom. I mostly kept to myself when I had to stay with dad. Kim did not try to build a relationship with me in any way.

When I was 18, grandfather got into a car accident that left him helpless. He needed a full time nurse to look after his daily needs and was unable to communicate with any of us. During that time Kim became pregnant. A few months before my half brother was born my grandfather passed away.

My grandparents were not wealthy but they did have some properties and valuables and a decent amount of money. In his will, he split all he had 3 ways: my uncle, my aunt, and me. My dad got an equivalent of $300. Kim tried to protest, that my half brother should get something, too, but the will was clear. My dad told me and her that all he had in the future would go to my half brother since I already got his share of inheritance from grandfather. I told him he could do whatever as I wanted very little to do with him and wold have as little to do with him from then on.

I go to a good college and am on track for a very well-paying job. I have very little contact with my dad's immediate family. A few months ago, however, my dad passed from a heart attack. He left behind a house and 2 cars that are still not fully paid for. He had some money but not enough to pay off everything.

Kim did not have a well paying job before my dad and she quitted her job after she was pregnant. She contacted me through my uncle and aunt that she is struggling and would like me to help pay for the house and cover some living costs. She had already sold 1 car and did her best to cut out a lot of expenses.

I told her she's on her own.

My paternal family now calls me selfish for not looking out for my half brother. They said grandfather would have wanted me to take care of him as he is innocent in all of this. I just think this is not at all my problem. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-04,"AITA for not helping out my half brother financially Not in the US

106,1d7w4hu,AITA for expecting my bf to come on a trip to my hometown with me and cancel his own plans with friends? ,"My bf and I (30M and 30F) have been dating for almost 2 years and I‚Äôve been planning a trip back to my hometown to visit extended family. It‚Äôs been years since I last visited (due to COVID and then work commitments) and the place holds alot of significance for me as 1. I was born and grew up there 2. My extended family live there 3. I have alot of happy childhood memories there. My bf knows those 3 facts about me. 

However, when I raised the idea to my bf, he was extremely unsupportive imo. He said I could go ofc but he really has no interest. I tried to tell him some fun facts about my hometown and he said he just really doesnt have any interest and he would rather use his leave to go snowboarding with his friends.

Last year, I went on a snowboarding trip with his friends. I want him to cancel his plans and go on this trip with me as 1. He should be able to tell its important to me 2. I‚Äôve been supportive of his travel ideas 3. His response was really quite self centred 4. Not only is it important to me, but its actually quite an honor for me to be inviting him. I didnt invite my ex to meet my extended family and I knew he would have wanted to. 

UPDATE

1. Yes he has limited leave so he can only do 1 trip

2. I raised this idea since the beginning of the year, the same time he has been messaging his friends groupchat asking for another snowtrip. The consensus at the beginning was nobody wanted one this year but just last week someone agreed and now everyone is planning (nothing booked yet). So - he only has plans to cancel, not a trip to cancel. 

3. The honor isnt being shown my hometown, its me feeling like I can share that part of my life with him. I felt honored aswell when he invited me to his parents house. 

4. Yes nobody lists ‚Äúvisiting the elderly‚Äù as a an attraction equal to snowboarding. But thats not what this is. This is about a bf showing he cares about his gf.

Also my son gets very attached, he LOVES people, when somebody comes over, he will not stop asking when they will come over again until they do. He hasnt been asking for them to come see him anymore because it has been so long that he has seen any of them. Im afraid he is just going to be let down after seeing his cousin once and not being able to again. Right now, my son is not affected by not seeing any of them,  but is having his cousin, who lives with both my siblings and talks about them nonstop, going to make him feel like he isnt enough for them?

However, last month we got into a disagreement over something I had borrowed from her but unfortunately couldn‚Äôt return the day after due to me being in another town for the night.

 I haven‚Äôt cut her out of my life because she‚Äôs family, but until I receive an apology I don‚Äôt want to speak to her and have been actively avoiding her whenever she comes over which has lead to some of my family members calling me an AH.

I have Dissociative Identity Disorder (D.I.D.), which means that I have multiple different identities, or alters, that reside in our body and I am the ‚Äúhost‚Äù alter. 

Of the altars one named Danny who is what as known as a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù alter meaning  that mentally he is 6 years old. Every time my mom comes over, Danny likes to sleep with her in the guest bedroom. This initially wasn‚Äôt not a problem but it became one when after my mom‚Äôs last visit, Danny would take over the body every night around 11pm and sleep in the guest room thinking our mom was still there. Keep in mind that I am up until later than 11 pm on a lot of nights, so it is very annoying to be doing something and then suddenly wake up the next morning or in the middle of the night. I also want to instill the fact that our mother is not here to Danny (we never lock our rooms in our family). After a few days, I locked the guest bedroom door and installed a camera inside the bedroom to see if he still tried to open the door. Sure enough, since then every day at 11 pm, Danny would attempt to open the door, and then immediately surrender control of the body. I told GF this, and she seemed ok with this solution.

There was an incident involving GF‚Äôs drunk friends that I wont get into cuz of the 3000 character limit, but the main problem occurred when GF‚Äôs mom stayed over. Now her mom tends to sleep at 9pm sharp and is easily scared, so we informed her abt the issue and told her to lock the door at all times and to not be freaked out by any knocking. She understood then, but that night Danny freaked her out and the next morning her mom confronted me and GF saying that I need to do something abt him. She got a bit aggressive, triggering an alter, Jake, to come out and snap at her. What Jake said apparently got her upset enough to leave immediately afterward. After she left, I told GF that I am not letting anyone sleep in that room until after 11 pm when Danny attempts to open the bed room, since this avoids freaking out people. GF told me that instead of making that ultimatum for other people, I should try to figure out a way to make Danny stop. I told her that I was trying my hardest to do that and that locking the door was the best solution after much deliberation. She then brought up Jake and his anger, and it turned into an argument abt how GF doesn‚Äôt like how my D.I.D. affects some of  her family and friends. I told her that she shouldn‚Äôt prioritize her family‚Äôs opinion abt this issue over GF‚Äôs and mine, which upset her and she, ironically, slept in the guest bedroom that night (after 11pm ofc). This happened yesterday and she still hasnt talked to me.

My family and I wanted to go to Sicily, our homeland, this year. However, it wasn't clearly communicated that it was assumed I would cover almost all the costs. Now, two months before the vacation, we've realized that I don't have enough money for it. My mom works part-time and can't contribute much since she has to pay rent. My dad could go to work but doesn't (and he also doesn't do anything around the house btw.)

When I told my sister that we probably wouldn't be able to go on vacation, she asked me about my expenses and if I could just save more money. This conversation made me realize that they might not fully understand my financial situation and the pressure it puts on me. It really felt like she was disappointed in me, as if it was my fault for us not being able to go. 

Now she is married and has a kid, they would‚Äôve covered their own expenses. I should‚Äôve covered for my parents and my younger brother.

I've only recently started working, since December, and I have a lot of expenses. I pay for my car, gas, insurance, and contribute a portion of my income to the household, among other things. I've even canceled my therapy appointments to avoid further bills. I also started looking for Minijobs to get more money. 

Then I felt like a dumbass, because why would I be looking for a second job, if my father doesn‚Äôt even have one in the first place?

Now I'm considering using the money I have to go on vacation with a friend. I wonder if that's unfair of me, considering my mom and siblings would also love to go on vacation. I understand they've been looking forward to it, but I feel overwhelmed and unfairly burdened with the financial responsibility.

113,1d7uxqh,AITA for telling  MY PARENTS not to control me ,"Hello everyone.
I don't really use Reddit all that much so I am not what to really do here ... 
I am 29 almost 30 years old woman ! It's kinda weird I use the word woman for myself when I feel just like a little girl being controlled.
 The last 3 and half years of my life I received a very generous scholarship abroad to get a masters degree.
Being from a very religious tight knit family I begged them to let me go and said it's only three years and I will visit in the middle of them which was a promise I kept.
I argued that such a degree will make my cv so much more attractive and will make my salary higher later; to which My dad agreed but ofc my mum didn't.

They call me selfish for wanting to leave. They said I am abandoning them! I even took a job that I hate to prove that its not that I want to leave but that my live can be better. I get 1/4 of what I can get if I am working abroad, even with less hours.
I am also exhausted physically and mentally.
I can't live like this! 
Tbh I also understand that they gave me their all while raising me and I understand that they want me next to them ... but what about what I want ? What about my future ? They think I am an asshole for leaving them, am I ?!
I have a younger sister as well but their relationship is not so good at the moment either because of a big family issue between them. This makes them even harder on me, as they are relying more on me to take of them and to keep the peace in the family...is that my role ?!
 I understand they love me and I love them but I am not getting any younger ... am I really selfish? Am I an asshole ?! Please help because I feel like there is a huge weight on my shoulders and I feel like my heart is so heavy that sometimes I can't even breathe !

I don't really use Reddit all that much so I am not what to really do here ... 
I am 29 almost 30 years old woman ! It's kinda weird I use the word woman for myself when I feel just like a little girl being controlled.
 The last 3 and half years of my life I received a very generous scholarship abroad to get a masters degree.
Being from a very religious tight knit family I begged them to let me go and said it's only three years and I will visit in the middle of them which was a promise I kept.
I argued that such a degree will make my cv so much more attractive and will make my salary higher later; to which My dad agreed but ofc my mum didn't.

I need opinions because I want to show my girlfriend that I am not the asshole in this situation.

I (48/M) divorced my ex-wife (45/F) 3 years ago because I fell for a younger woman (21/F) who is now my girlfiend. Me and my ex have 2 daughters together, and in the last 3 years I tried to stay in their life as much as I could but my ex always tried to keep them from me and I feel like my kids completely took my ex's side and they hold some kind of grudge against me.

 My oldest daughter (18/F) just graduated from Highschool and my ex wife called me asking if I could help her buy a car for my daughter. I obviously said yes because I felt like this could be the perfect opportunity to rebuild a relationship with my oldest daughter, but when I brought the idea up for my girlfriend she totally flipped out and reminded me of the time when she asked me to buy her a car a year ago (I told her no and we had a really big argument which almost caused us to separate). I told her why I wanted to help my ex buy a car for my daughter and my girlfriend said that if I go through with helping she will leave me unless I buy a car for her aswell. I told her no and I ended up sleeping on the couch that night.

A couple of days later I went to meet with my ex and we brought a used car for my oldest. My girlfriend was furious and ignored me for a few days, and after she was done ignoring me she started to pack her things while telling me that ""I am an asshole"" and ""I never loved her"".

115,1d7uj7h,AITA for wishing Happy Birthday on afternoon?,"My BF (M31) had his birthday on Saturday, and he went to visit his parents (F74, M79). I (M30) wasn't with him - I had hell week at work and needed relax. BF understood and told me that he'll go alone. We have agreed to celebrate his birthday together next week and I have told him about my plan for celebration, which he liked.

On Saturday, around 14:00, I got a call from his mother, who asked me, in passive aggressive tone, if I know what day today is. I told her it's my BF's birthday. Then she scolded me that I haven't called to wish him yet, and asked if I forgot. I told I haven't, and that I‚Äôll call after lunch - which was true, I planned to. She told me that I disappointed her, and as a BF, I should call as the first person in the morning. I said I don't see any difference between morning and afternoon, the whole day is his birthday. She told me it matters, that it's how you show love and if I was her partner, she would be very upset with me. I said that I know my BF isn't so petty. She was talking to me in a condescending, judgmental tone, like a strict teacher scolding a child who did something wrong. I called BF and wished him hour later, he was in good mood.

Despite BF seeming OK, the conversation with mother dampened my mood. I was thinking if I did anything wrong, I was angry that she got involved into which I think is none of her business, I hated the way she talked to me. When BF arrived Sunday evening, he saw that I'm in bad mood and asked what happened. I refused to, but he pressed and I told him everything. He became annoyed at his mother; told me I did nothing wrong. I asked him not to talk to her, but he called her, and gently (!) asked her to not involve in matters that are just between us next time.

She became extremely angry and cut off the call. She then called me and started a rant on how disappointed she is, that she thought I am a decent person. She said if I really loved her son, wishing him would be the first thing on my mind in the morning. I responded by saying that my love is not measured by the time I choose to make birthday call, and that is the pettiest thing to focus on, and that I love my BF from all my heart. She refused to hear it, implied I don't love him, and mocked me for feeling bad about the previous convo. Then she told me to reflect on my actions and that I shall never speak to her like that again. (I remained civil during the call (although I was shaking), it was her who was harsh and cruel towards me.)

Today her husband (M79) called me and told me that BF's mother meant well, that she just ""gently"" reminded me, she was acting out of care for her son, and she used normal tone and I am the one making it into something bad, and that I fuc\*ed up everything, his wife had a meltdown and is crying constantly.

It turned out great, we had a lot of fun, laughing and I vastly enjoyed myself. A little backstory, my ex and I broke up on good terms even with her dumping me over email, however, I just needed a little time and space away from her. This caused her to still proceed to hug me, kiss me on the cheek and it made me wildly uncomfortable so I sat with a different group. Then she joined the group. It angered me profusely because I believed she was following me around and it still invalidated my boundaries of not wanting anything to do with her. Then I sat with my old group, but everytime I would choose to sit with my old group she would be there, then with the new one she was there too. With my new friend group a lot of the girls were talking bad behind her back, and I admittley was apart of that. They claimed that they did not want there and it was only because they felt bad for her and because of ""rowing"". I told them, that I could easily talk to her about it and ask if she could leave the group, they claimed it was mean, yet I believed talking behind her back then acting fake to her face was a lot more meaner. Yet I stayed out of it, I didn't want to lose my new friends because I genuinely had no where else to go and I was trying to not cause drama because I was having a good run without making chaos. 

We also had a group chat and my ex asked to be apart of it, my friends told me that they didn't want her there, so I said I would remove her if they added her so that I could be the mean one, they said that yes to do that. Then came the day when she was added, I removed her straight away. And people were like, ok? They didn't care. She got added twice so I removed her again and then she removed me. I was pissed now, then everyone else got mad at us even though they knew I was going to do it and they told me to do it. Then one of my friends created a group chat called ""let's work it out"" which I left because those are stupid and I'm more a face-to-face kind of person.

119,1d7txb4,AITA for saying no to my ex‚Äôs 6night break?,"My ex wife (33f) and I (34m) separated 6 months ago, we have two children together (5 & 3). After my ex and I separated, she moved in with her new partner (34m) and his child (5).

We have been co parenting and managing the time we have with the children by jointly producing a schedule that sets out the month ahead, we aim for a 50/50 split a week taking into account various social or work commitments.

My ex sent me a schedule that covers the 6 week summer school break.

My ex said, she has blocked out two consecutive weeks 31st July - 14th August (7 nights each) for each of us to have the children. Her reasoning was she wanted to give the children a ‚Äúgood‚Äù holiday 31st-7th as a new family (ex, new partner, 5, 5, 3). Then I can have our children to give them a holiday. 7th - 14th.

My initial reaction was, are those dates flexible? Would she consider 5 nights? As I struggled not seeing the children for a long block, but also as a single parent, 7 nights is a lot for me on my own.

Her response was I should be able to look after the children for 7 nights and that I‚Äôm getting 7 nights free to do what I want, and the block can‚Äôt move because they struggled to get time where all the children are together (which to me is fair). But she would do 6 nights with the children instead and have some time off between 7-14th.

I redrafted the schedule taking in both points, and send it back. I reduced the block to 6 nights, then moved the chunk of time I was having our children away from the 7th-14th to a time that suited me for 6 nights. My reasoning was I should be able to choose when my 6 nights are to a time that suits me, so I move it to the 25th July - 31st, and also worked in 4nights 5 days (9th - 12th August) for me to have our children to give her a period of time between the 7th-14th.

She didn‚Äôt agree, kept the regular cadence we have the children on a normal week and kept in the two 6night breaks as per original version.

I pushed back and said, if you get to choose when to have our children for a break, the compromise is I should at least be able to choose when I get to have our children for a break. She said no, the compromise is 6nights, not 7 as you want 5.

It transpires that the reason she wants the 6 nights between 7-14th is that neither her nor her new partner have any children that period and it will give her time to (her words) decompress.

She wants 6nights as her and her new partner only have one child free evening a week, and would like 6nights of the whole year where she doesn‚Äôt have the children.

We‚Äôve not come to a compromise yet. I did mention if she opened with that, and said if we can we work in time so we can each have a break, I would have been more receptive.

I was being drip fed reasons as to why that block was so important and feel like I‚Äôm being dictated too. She‚Äôs now threatening mediation and more formal routes of child custody. And feel that just added unnecessary pressure.

120,1d7tvuq,AITA for not giving my brother access to an apartment that our grandmother promised him?,"20 years ago, my grandmother promised my brother an apartment before she passed away. She registered him there without my grandfather's knowledge (in our country, this is often considered equivalent to ownership rights, though it's not entirely so). My grandfather was living in the United States at the time and rarely visited. My father and brother started renovating the apartment together.

However, when my grandfather returned to Poland and discovered that my brother was registered there, he decided to have him legally deregistered without his knowledge. For several years, my grandfather only visited my father‚Äôs sister‚Äôs family and had a strained relationship with our side of the family. My brother got offended and stopped talking to him altogether.

Eventually, my father and grandfather reconnected, and my grandfather decided to write a will leaving the apartment to my father upon his death. Sadly, my father passed away, and my grandfather made a new will, bequeathing the apartment to my brother. Unfortunately, my brother is an alcoholic, and my grandfather started worrying that after his death, my brother might squander the apartment. My grandfather gave my brother an ultimatum that he had to be sober during his next visit, or he would leave the apartment to someone else. Of course, my brother started drinking again before my grandfather‚Äôs visit. My grandfather gave him a second chance, but my brother drank again before his arrival.

My grandfather then decided to leave the apartment to me because, apart from my mother, only my wife and I kept in regular contact with him. After my grandfather‚Äôs death, I took care of bringing his ashes back, arranging the funeral, and handling the inheritance matters. The apartment is about to be officially transferred to me, but my brother claims he deserves half because that was our grandmother‚Äôs wish and because he invested in renovating the apartment.

We have now agreed that I will transfer the apartment to my daughter when she comes of age, and he has agreed to this, but he wants access to the apartment in the meantime. I fear that he might move in, start drinking there, and I will end up having to pay the bills.

122,1d7tua7,AITA for not letting my buddy sleep on the couch?,"Allright the background here - I bought a house about a year and a half ago, and I had 4 of my very good friends move in with me (everybody rents their own room, everywhere else is common space.) All 4 of us have known each other since high school, and everybody in general gets along pretty well, all of us are guys in our early 30s or late 20s, everybody has their rent set up as cheap as I could possibly afford to let it be

The issue: My buddy (who we will call Ralph for the sake of privacy) is not doing well.

Lately Ralph has been taking to sleeping on the couch and not in his room - which would not be a problem if it was once in a while but its becoming like 3 days a week, and would be more if I hadn't called him out on it. He is also CONSTANTLY WATCHING TV, if he isn't at work, hes on the couch, and he only works about 25-30 hours a week. Ralph claims he sleeps better on the couch as it lets his back be propped up. Problem is the couch is in the living room upstairs that is open to the kitchen, and this means not just me but ANYBODY who wants to use the kitchen late at night or early morning has to sneak past a sleeping half naked dude on the couch.

For additional elaboration, Ralph also did this at his old apartment to the point where he literally never went into his room and basically forced his roommates (who currently live with me) to have to navigate around him anytime they wanted to use the kitchen, dryer or god forbid use the living room, because he was either sleeping on the couch or hogging the t.v. that his computer is hooked up to.

I am not okay with the above situation being repeated in my house - I don't want to have to feel like I have to sneak around anybody to use the kitchen, I could give a care less about the TV, but I do like to occasionally read a book on the couch, or just sit and chill, and feel like the other guys in the house should be able to feel free to do the same.

My plan is basically to have him help me pick out a way to kit out his room to allow him to sleep more comfortably, whether it be adding bolster pillows on his wall, a cradle, sling, whatever - I don't really care what it takes, I will pay for it if it gets him off the couch!

All joking aside, if it doesn't work out getting his room setup to allow him to sleep more comfortably, I will be asking him to leave/evicting him. Ralph has rented a room from me, the living room is defined in the lease as communal space that neither he nor anyone else has the option of renting, and if he chooses not to sleep in his room then I do not feel like he should have the living room or any room in the house as an option for a full time sleeping quarters. Kicking him out is an absolute last resort due to him not having the funds to go anywhere else than back with his parents, which would be probably worse for his mental health than being homeless.

* I would love to travel with her, but don't really see how it is possible - it would mean rushing from place to place, and then her flying back home alone, which I think is kind of sad - overall it doesn't sound like a fun/relaxed/romantic trip together, but rather something that would be a little bit forced.

I hear days later from my other MIL that I am ""rude"" and ""unpleasant"" towards her wife because I wanted privacy.

All 4 of us have known each other since high school, and everybody in general gets along pretty well, all of us are guys in our early 30s or late 20s, everybody has their rent set up as cheap as I could possibly afford to let it be (between 5-670 a month depending on room size)

The issue: My buddy (who we will call Ralph for the sake of privacy) is not doing well. 

Before I start ripping, I want to make it extremely clear that I am on Team Ralph - the guy is family and when he is in a good state of mind he is a delight to be around. We have supported each other through the good times and bad times, I GENUINELY want the man to succeed, live a good life and show the world what he is capable of: This guy has so much charisma he could sell a telescope to a blind person.

Lately Ralph has been taking to sleeping on the couch and not in his room - which would not be a problem if it was once in a while but its becoming like 3 days a week, and would be more if I hadn't called him out on it. He is also CONSTANTLY WATCHING TV, if he isn't at work, hes on the couch, and he only works about 25-30 hours a week. Ralph claims he sleeps better on the couch as it lets his back be propped up. Problem is the couch is in the living room upstairs that is open to the kitchen, and this means not just me but ANYBODY who wants to use the kitchen late at night or early morning has to sneak past a sleeping half naked dude on the couch.

For additional elaboration, Ralph also did this at his old apartment to the point where he literally never went into his room and basically forced his roommates (who currently live with me) to have to navigate around him anytime they wanted to use the kitchen, dryer or god forbid use the living room, because he was either sleeping on the couch or hogging the t.v. that his computer is hooked up to.

I am not okay with the above situation being repeated in my house - I don't want to have to feel like I have to sneak around anybody to use the kitchen, I could give a care less about the TV, but I do like to occasionally read a book on the couch, or just sit and chill, and feel like the other guys in the house should be able to feel free to do the same.

My plan is basically to have him help me pick out a way to kit out his room to allow him to sleep more comfortably, whether it be adding bolster pillows on his wall, a cradle, sling, whatever - I don't really care what it takes, I will pay for it if it gets him off the couch!

All joking aside, if it doesn't work out getting his room setup to allow him to sleep more comfortably, I will be asking him to leave/evicting him. Ralph has rented a room from me, the living room is defined in the lease as communal space that neither he nor anyone else has the option of renting, and if he chooses not to sleep in his room then I do not feel like he should have the living room or any room in the house as an option for a full time sleeping quarters. Kicking him out is an absolute last resort due to him not having the funds to go anywhere else than back with his parents, which would be probably worse for his mental health than being homeless.

128,1d7svwa,AITA for telling my SIL her 'job' doesn't mean she stops caring about her kid?,"Ok, so I (20M) have an older brother Oliver, (24M). Oliver had a kid pretty early (accident) and due to our culture got married to Sasha, (27F) and has a 4 year old, Lily. They both had to pretty much put their life on hold for Lily, Sasha having nothing to do with her BA in English Lit and Oliver working like 3 jobs. 

Now that Lily is soon to start school so Sasha can finally do something with her degree, she wants to be a teacher so that means training and tests and programs, which means she can't really do anything with Lily in the meantime. Oliver took a few days off to try and give Sasha a grace period but eventually called me and begged me to help him. I'm on summer break so why not. Currently I'm staying at their house to help out with Lily. Problem is, I'm not just helping, I'm doing everything.

Sasha says finding a job is basically a full time job itself but even people with fulltime jobs can say 'hello' to their kid once in a while. She's not speaking to Lily pretty much at all, ignores her when she tries. I'm also doing most of her work around the house now. 

I don't mind doing this for a bit but this is mildly concerning (at least to me) I mean if Sasha can't look at her kid while preparing for a job whats gonna happen when she actually gets one. 

This came to a head yesterday when sasha made her daughter cry and then snapped her fingers at me to take care of it. I did it, because I was worried about Lily. But after I'd settled Lily I went back to Sasha and told her that her 'job' doesn't mean she stops caring about her kid. She called me an ass, said I had no idea about adult problems, I'm just a kid who can't even drink yet. 

Idk, I'm not sure. She thinks I'm an ass but I don't think this is normal behaviour. I mean I don't have my own kid so Idk. AITA?

I'm the oldest out of four kids. My younger brother ""Ben"" (m20) was in a relationship with this girl ""Emma"" (f22) on and off since he was 18. They ended up breaking up at the beginning of this year because Emma had a drinking problem and was refusing to get help.

In April, Emma convinced our parents to let her stay with them because she said she had nowhere to go as her parents kicked her out.

Ben refused to stay in the house with Emma and had a huge argument with our parents over this. He has been staying at me and my wife's place on an air mattress. My parents were really upset about this as in their culture, kids do not move out until they are married, and even when they are, sometimes they will stay with their parents.

My parents, mainly my mom, is urging me to ask Ben to leave and go back to their home. She said Ben is overreacting and that they can't just throw Emma out. She is also particularly upset because Ben is in a college course (which my parents pay for), and has not been going to class because my home is a 3 hour drive from the campus.

132,1d7s44y,AITA for not respecting my dad‚Äôs curfew?,"I [21F] live with my dad [58M] and older brother. I know I‚Äôm a bit old to, but it‚Äôs rough in this economy.

The topic of a curfew has been a contentious one between my dad and I over the past few years. When I was 18, my dad told me that now that I‚Äôm an adult, I no longer had a curfew, as long as I communicated where I was. But not long after that, if I was out late with friends, he would text me and tell me to be home by midnight/eleven/etc. (really whatever he felt in the moment). I‚Äôd remind him that he said I didn‚Äôt have a curfew. He‚Äôd always respond that he waits up for me to get home, so by being out late, I‚Äôm keeping him up and disrespecting his authority. I‚Äôve told him multiple times that even though he rescinded my curfew when I was 18, I understood if he wanted me to have one. I understand that:
- a parent worries about their kid & he wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep if I‚Äôm not home
- it‚Äôs his house and his rules
- he bought me my car and makes the insurance payments on it, I just pay gas
- I don‚Äôt pay rent, either‚Äî  we‚Äôve agreed that my full time job is being a college student right now (though I do work multiple jobs on top of that, just not enough to afford rent with 8+ classes every semester, that‚Äôs why I still live with him)

So I told him to give me a curfew if he wanted me to have one, I just needed a rule to follow so I knew if I was breaking it! But every time we had that conversation, he never told me definitively that I had a curfew‚Äî then continued to get mad/text if I was out late, wanting me home around midnight usually.

Maybe a year ago now, he finally established my curfew to be midnight on weekdays and 2 AM on weekends, though he‚Äôs still inconsistent about weekends. Now that I‚Äôm almost 21, though, I feel like it‚Äôs not fair to still have a curfew. I‚Äôm out late with friends because none of them have curfews, cause I‚Äôm on campus working on projects, or for my jobs. I‚Äôm an adult at this point and I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs feasible anymore, he has to let me go at some point. So I have not been respecting his curfew for the past few months, which has obviously caused tension in our relationship.

Tonight, he texted me at 12:11 AM (on a Monday night, so I was breaking curfew) asking if I was going to be home soon. I told him if he was waiting up for me, I‚Äôd just spend the night there at my [male] friend‚Äôs house. He responded ‚ÄúAt a guy‚Äôs house? No.‚Äù I told him there were multiple friends there, guys and girls (not a lie) and he just stopped responding, which he also does a lot. I ended up coming home a little before 2 AM.

I know I‚Äôve been inconsistent in this situation, but I believe it‚Äôs warranted considering I‚Äôve gotten older. I‚Äôm extremely lucky to be financially supported by him and I don‚Äôt want to push it, but I also think there‚Äôs just no winning with him.

134,1d7rwgx,AITA- for calling my mom selfish ,"
I apologize for the long post and  any bad grammar

I 17f had a fight with my mom 32f over moving to Vegas (we live in Ohio). Our relationship is already strained and has been for a while

we were arguing about it because I don't wanna move despite her trying to persuade me with things like ""you'll be able to start fresh and you'll have a pool in the back yard"" I can't even swim so I don't get her point with that one,  I mostly don't want to because I'm about to graduate high school next school year and I have the chance to graduate early with an honors diploma.  I also want to graduate with all of my friends.

But when I explained all of this too her she just told me that I'd make more friends and that she hates her life here and she wants a fresh start in her life and her being here is taking a massive toll on her mental health.

She keeps promising that it will be better this time and every time she bring it up I shut it down and I get called a Debbie downer and today when she said this I said well your selfish and delusional.

I apologize for the long post and  any bad grammar

I 17f had a fight with my mom 32f over moving to Vegas (we live in Ohio). Our relationship is already strained and has been for a while

we were arguing about it because I don't wanna move despite her trying to persuade me with things like ""you'll be able to start fresh and you'll have a pool in the back yard"" I can't even swim so I don't get her point with that one,  I mostly don't want to because I'm about to graduate high school next school year and I have the chance to graduate early with an honors diploma.  I also want to graduate with all of my friends.

But when I explained all of this too her she just told me that I'd make more friends and that she hates her life here and she wants a fresh start in her life and her being here is taking a massive toll on her mental health.  And I understand that so that's why I suggested that she can move and I'll stay with my grandparents or another relative till I turn 18 in November.

he once told me that our coworker, a mutual friend, talks about me a lot (i know he likes me but hasn't made a move because he knows we're somewhat a couple) and if i ever wanted to be with this other guy or someone else, i just have to tell him and we'd be good. 2 days after we had this conversation, i kissed a girl who‚Äôs been into me for a while. i only thought about kissing her because he was my first kiss, and i always said if i were to kiss anyone i wouldn't mind their gender

also, i asked her for a kiss. apparently, this was the last straw for him since i went for it, if it were the other way around, he'd feel hatred towards her only

after the kiss, i hesitated to tell him literally right away for two reasons:

1. we work separated from each other as if it were in different departments and almost every day i leave before him
2. it's her, he said he feels more jealous bc she's already too flirty with me. i know i'm very direct and made people feel bad due to that, so i tried to pick the right moment to talk

after telling him he got upset, turns out i misunderstood his earlier statement. he now clarified that it's only okay if i tell him before it happens so he can step away first. i get it now and feel kinda stupid about it. he understands my side after talking and even had my mum send him a voice message that i have trouble understanding when it's not 100% clear 

i feel terrible for hurting him. never made anyone heartbroken before and can't imagine myself cheating. i did it to experiment with girls and thought he was okay with it since he knows i'm aro and am experimenting with him as well. i still want to be with him, we have a connection that i don't have with her

never intended to cause him pain so i keep blaming myself because i hurt him, and basically i hurt him in the same way his ex did and it's making me super anxious since i feel like i'm just another person who played with his feelings

136,1d7rbgn,AITA for refusing to do a family photo in a Christmas card?,"39/f here. I‚Äôll sum this up the best I can.

My dad‚Äôs wife insists on sending Christmas cards this year with the entire family printed on it. To say I‚Äôve been estranged from my father and his wife on and off for years would be an understatement. They are, what some may consider, the 1%. Extremely wealthy, elitists. I chose to live a more modest lifestyle decades ago. I don‚Äôt access the respect to give someone based on their occupation which according to them, is a taboo way to live. Wtf? His wife, in particular, routinely gossips about me, my husband, my children, and her own children as well. She‚Äôs done so for years. Children, stepchildren, grandchildren, family members, friends, etc. are always on the table to garner vulnerable narcissistic attention from their wealthy, simp audience. Anyway, over Easter they had a professional photo shoot that included her three adult children, my brother, his wife, and their kids. My kids and I were across the country and not in attendance. She now wants me to send her a picture of my family to photoshop into the forced Christmas card charade. 

A few things to mention: I find this kind of thing very egotistic and insincere. Christmas cards are great! But mass printing photos of your adult children on a card solely for your country club friends‚Äô amusement isn‚Äôt it. My teenage boys don‚Äôt want to do it because they don‚Äôt want their faces put out there (they‚Äôve even barred me from posting their pictures on social media, and I fully respect that). Needless to say, I don‚Äôt want to either.  Mainly because we‚Äôve never had much of a relationship with them in the first place. The whole idea of ‚Äúlook at how happy our fake family is‚Äù is rather misleading for a slew of reasons that extend well beyond my personal grievances.

This is the third time I‚Äôve declined to participate using various excuses before, but I intend on being honest this time‚Ä¶and I know a shit storm of shame and ostracizing will be on the horizon. 

Am I the asshole?

I prefer to stay more quiet about myself to not draw attention, but they do as they please and that is okay. Now, I‚Äôve noticed that when I am not around them or don‚Äôt hangout with them for a day, other people who are usually mean to me, are very kind and neutral. I‚Äôve come to enjoy feeling human gain. Now, this is not the only reason I am leaving. There is one person is particular, I‚Äôll call them L, that is a very, particular soul‚Ä¶. To say the least.

We have corrected L on this behaviour many times. L, is also very condescending and rude. Ls friend, I‚Äôll call G, also has autism and uses it to defend any bad behaviour they have, like calling people mean names, slamming lockers at me, and overall being aggressive.

Recently, they discussed a bachelor party and a wedding from last year, which I didn't attend. I felt I no longer needed to engage, so I played on my phone since it was almost midnight and my social battery was exhausted. My boyfriend noticed and texted me to ask if I was having a good time. Although it wasn't ideal, I was enjoying the bonfire, the dogs, and the background conversations, so I replied that I was.

The next day, we went to Pride, which was overwhelming for me as it was my first time attending. I met many people and tried my best to be polite. While I don‚Äôt remember if I checked my phone, my boyfriend didn't say anything if he noticed.

On Sunday, while driving to his parents' house, he mentioned I spent too much time on my phone with his friends, which might come off as rude. This was the third time we'd had this conversation. For the first two times, I explained that small talk feels insincere to me, but I would try my best.

I only used my phone at the end of the night when his friends were talking among themselves, so I don't feel I was being rude.

I told him his comments made me sad and disappointed because it felt like he was putting his friends over me. What made me furious was when he said he wanted me to show interest in his friends because he has an idealized image of a boyfriend. It felt like he was trying to change me based on his ideals, not out of concern for my well-being.

I didn't understand why he wanted his friends to feel comfortable when they hadn't complained and I wasn't complaining either. He said he values his partner showing interest in his friends.

Their requested price was much cheaper than what I'd have to pay for a hotel. It's been almost two months since then and I have yet to pay them back. I've kept them informed that money is tight and that apologized that it was taking so long. I recently received a message asking about 1.5x what we agreed on.

Edit: Thanks for responses. I agree that I was at fault for keeping them waiting for so long. I don't know if I can get the new amount now but I'll do my best to get them at least the original amount as soon as I can.
",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-04,"WIBTA if I don't pay the new amount?  When I was traveling, an aquaintance who lives in the area offered to let me stay with them. Their requested price was much cheaper than what I'd have to pay for a hotel. It's been almost two months since then and I have yet to pay them back. I've kept them informed that money is tight and that apologized that it was taking so long. I recently received a message asking about 1.5x what we agreed on. I don't really have that and I'm wondering would I be an asshole if I refused to pay that amount? Chances are I will have to interact with this person later.

143,1d7pv8z,AITA for saying out loud that I'm still in love with my cousin during a family reunion?,"Hi, I know the Title is pretty disturbing, it does sound creepy for me once I re-read it but there's no better way to say it. Before you start judging I want you all to know that the context will be very important, you can form your own ideas but please wait until you read everything to say something.

Me (29M) and my fiance Who I'll name Allie (28F) met when we were 20 and 21 at Uni. We got along immediately since we shared a liking for movies and TV shows, We introduced each other to our families, we had movie nights and a pretty loving and healthy relationship, so after years later I Finally ask her to marry me and she said Yes.

We started planning the wedding and I took her to my house for a little vacay with my family. She had a pretty good relationship with them and that was awesome since my Family is a pretty important aspect of my life. For context, I was given in adoption when I was almost a year old and I got adopted by my Parents a year later. As far as I knew I was removed from my Bio-family because of a drug issue concerning my bio-mum. Ever since My family has been a blessing, Even more After They took Allie As part of the family.

During the preparation of our wedding I started spending more time with her family and I also had a great relationship with them. Anyway, For my birthday, Her mother Gave us one of these DNA tests that are supposed to tell you about your heritage. There were two tests so I insisted Allie to take the other one. She did so and we waited almost a month for the results. 

We were on a dinner, with my family and hers, And the result arrived just in that moment, I thought it would be fun to show the result to our families and we could get some laughs and Stories for the rest of the Dinner. We prepared everything and I called for everyone attention. Everything was laughs until we got to the part of the DNA compatibility and It shows that we shared a big percentage of our DNA, total silence, we thought it was wrong so we took an official DNA test that shows that me and Allie are actually cousins. This of course was very shocking and led to a lot of discussion between our families, during the tests we decided to run I happened to be son of an aunt if hers from her Father's side.

Of course after the revelation we cancel the wedding, And we had to made up for a lot of stuff on our romantic life such as the fact we already had intimate moments and some pregnancy Scares. Almost a year later we start seeing each other but we address each other as cousins, which was pretty much heartbreaking for me because she was and she still is the love of my life, and I don't think I'll be able to move her from such an intimate place of my heart to just a cousin.

This year, Around Easter, she started dating this guy, he is actually pretty nice and I don't resent him for being with her but it still hurts me because I feel that she moved on from me way faster than me, I understand we are cousins but still hurts. Yesterday during a family dinner on her house, I was there since I start Spending some more time with my bio mum, so I was really a cousin now. Allie and this guy, We'll name Harry, were very close to each other and I just wanted to throw up. At a moment in the party Allie and I get to Have some time alone while setting up the Children table and I asked her How was thing going in with Harry, She said it was good and that she was actually hoping for things to get more serious. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that she can find a good man but deep inside it pains me that it's not me, I tried to play my part as her ""cousin"" because I am, so I gave her a hug and Told her that I was happy for her. Then harry Got in and said ""WOW! that hand is a little low, bud. I might think you know her too well"" I tried to play cool and just laughed but I notice that that comment made her feel awkward. So I tried to brush it off by saying That ""I do know her way too well we Shared a bed once"" Now thinking back at That I could have choosed my word better, I wasn't referring to THAT but more of all the movie nights we had.

Allie Looked at me Stunned but Harry had a terrified looked on his face. I tried to explain because I assumed that Allie told him about How I was just getting into the family but apparently I was wrong. The discovery led to an argument where he started yelling at Allie for not telling him that she was and quote ""F*cking with her cousin"" That makes me angry and I couldn't believe he was just ignoring the fact that we didn't know before. I start yelling at him that he was a jerk for judge her and ignore the Context behind but that only directed his anger at me. I don't remember the specific words he used, cuz I was truly mad. But he yelled that I was a freak for show up when he was there and that I was disrespectful and Disgusting for trying to get her attention back after knowing we are Related. I was furious. And so I told him that if I was him she wouldn't have to go through this embarrassment because I actually do love her enough to not humiliate Her like that. The argument escalated to the point that he left and now was Allie yelling at me saying that I was a jerk for saying what happened between us and that we were just cousins, I tried to apologise but I end up saying that I couldn't take it, that I missed her and that I'm still in love with her, she looked at me, I don't know how to describe her face cuz it was pretty confusing, but she left and I was kicked out. Later on I start receiving a lot of calls and Messages saying that I was a sick for ruining her relationship like that and that I was Disgusting and selfish for doing that to her and make her think that she was still in love with me even when now we know we are family.

She was completely enraged and now refuses to talk about my wedding. She‚Äôs also a bridesmaid, which she was mad about too because she wanted the MOH role. 

I just need to know am I rude? Or do others agree?

One was a sister charm and the reason for me buying the bracelet. I'm not mad that she didn't return the $300 in the present but that I didn't get one at all. Every year before my birthday she starts an argument with me and then proceeds to ignore my birthday. For her birthday this year she wants to go to a concert. Which I bought the tickets to.

A little more context for everyone. My older sister got a sibling tattoo and paid for hers and my older brothers. She had PROMISED me that she would pay for my sibling tattoo for my 18th birthday. The fight we had gotten in had ended up being about me asking her if she knew a spot to get the tattoo and I'd make the appointment. She got mad and called me selfish for even asking and ended up not doing it or getting me a present with the excuse that i was being selfish for asking and ""rushing her"" again i was planning on buying the tickets later and told her i could not afford it i work retail at $12.50 and hour and have to pay rent. And she had told me to open the credit card for the tickets and buy them then. Also This year she told me if I bought the concert tickets she's buy me whatever outfit I want for the concert. We have gone shopping and I've shown her those options to my knowledge she hasn't bought anything yet. 

Another little update last night my sister invited my bestfriend over to her place (didn't invite me) and proceeded to tell my bestfriend that I was acting like a bitch and being selfish for not coming over and hanging out with her (the thing that started this whole fight) when I had expressed that I was too tired to hangout that night.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-04,"WIBTA if I gave my sister's concert ticket to someone else?

148,1d7pako,AITA for blowing my top at an ex friend for getting their brother to tell me to shut up?,"I would first like to state before anything that I am no longer in contact with this person (thankfully) but this situation had always made me sick to my stomach in thinking I was the A-hole.  
I'm not sure if this is where this belongs but I just need an outside perspective from random people I guess.  
All you need to know about me is that I'm a minor and my old friend, who we'll call Meg, is only a few months younger. Meg was my first real best friend in school, we bonded over video games and they got me into a fandom that I'm still a part of to this day... however, they're not.   
I never had a problem with them leaving the fandom, I respect their opinion even to this day, even though Meg doesn't share the same sentiment.

They were very open about this fact and would try to guilt me into leaving it, completely ignoring the fact that being a part of this made me happy, so I just stopped talking about it entirely.  
To me, it seemed to be too harsh to just break off a friendship/make an argument because I felt as though I couldn't be myself around Meg.

One night something happened to do with the fandom and I was a little emotional as was another friend of mine and we were confiding in each other, but as this was happening Meg decided to send a meme trashing the thing I love, which I am certain I made clear I didn't like it when they did that. I told them I wasn't in the mood and we started to have a nice conversation!  
Until their brother messages me to say ""Meg wants me to tell you to stop talking about -fandom-""  
Here's the part where I could be the a-hole, I just blew up at them. I thought I was having a good conversation with them, we were both sharing our interests and finding common ground in some tragedy that happened.  
  
For some reason, it took a while after this altercation for us to cut ties but I can't help but think I wasn't being the best friend in this scenario... Again there won't be any updates about how 'Ohh we talked and expressed our feelings and we're good now' because that's not the reality, the reality is I haven't been in communication with Meg since I was petty- which I do regret a little but Meg didn't care at all, seemed to be over it real quick.

150,1d7ouxj,AITA for not telling my FWB she looks like my ex?,"I 27M met my FWB 27F on Tinder about 2 months ago. We had major chemistry from the get go and level set this would be casual. We‚Äôve been seeing one another 1-2 times a week. Sometimes it‚Äôs just sex, other times it‚Äôs making dinner together, doing day trips, normal friend stuff. 

The thing is she is a short redhead. I have a bit of a thing for redheads. My ex of 4 years is also a short redhead. They also both happen to be named Emily‚Ä¶

At this point, things have progressed and while we aren‚Äôt dating we certainly act like we are. Kisses before leaving, cuddling, heart emojis, shopping together. Despite this, we‚Äôve both reiterated clearly we‚Äôre not looking for commitment (as recent as last night). She is seeing someone else currently and so am I. With that being said, I think we both may be catching some feelings just having spent so much time together. 

While I like red hair, it‚Äôs just a plus. I‚Äôve dated people of all types. Her name being the same is just a coincidence. At the end of the day I can recognize when someone‚Äôs attractive but only ‚Äòlike‚Äô them enough to sleep with them if I have an emotional connection with them. 

However, my friend group of girls is shitting on me for not telling her and even seeing her in the first place. I genuinely feel her name could be Voldemort and she could be bald and I‚Äôd still like her. She‚Äôs not naturally red so eventually she‚Äôll be blonde and I‚Äôd like that equally. 

She is 10x the person my ex was. Professionally and personally. My ex was a narcissist and abusive, which I have found a supporting community to work through so it isn‚Äôt a matter of being ‚Äòover‚Äô my ex in my mind.

152,1d7onxd,WIBTA if I decide to stop seeing my dad unless he apologizes for shunning me?,"I (30F) have recently got back into contact with my parents after giving birth to my son. I have had no contact with them for almost 8 years prior to this. 
My family are very religious. I left the religion and they stopped talking to me.
I did not reach out and tell my parents when I was pregnant. Instead, I told them they had a grandson when he was 2 weeks old. I then didn't hear from them until over a month later. My dad sent me a sanctimonious text about how they wouldn't be talking to me or in my life unless I return to the flock. I replied saying that I would not be returning under any circumstances. About half an hour later my mum, who has terminal cancer, rang me to tell me she didn't know dad would be sending this text and she does not feel the same way - she wants to be in my life. She then proceeded to apologize for not being there and expressing how she really wanted to be there for me and my son now. She came round that day. 
Now my son is 4 months old and my dad has now met him and seen me. This has only happened because my mum has been too ill to travel alone and my dad doesn't want to have to drive back and forth. I have had no apology from him.
I'm keeping it civil for my mums sake but I have found that since seeing him all I think about is telling him how intolerable he is. I feel like he doesn't deserve to be in my life or my son's life especially as he hasn't even apologized - he doesn't even think he is in the wrong. He has never apologized to me for anything ever and actually I don't think I have ever heard him admit wrongdoing for anything my whole life. Everything is always everyone else's fault or problem or people are too sensitive. There is so much I could say, so many examples. I want to know if I should address this with him or my mum? Should I just tolerate him for mums sake? Would I be wrong to ask to only see mum - I could visit her while dad is at work maybe. It's stressing me out and I want to protect my son in the future as I doubt dad would respect my wishes regarding not trying to recruit my son into his faith. If he apologized I think I'd be able to move past a lot of this. But acting like nothing has happened is weird. It's too much to just let go of without something being acknowledged imo.  AITA?

154,1d7ode2,WIBTA if i(19) told my mother to not to pay back my friend‚Äôs (18) parents for groceries?,"
I‚Äôm on vacation‚Ä¶ ‚Äúvacation‚Äù in Mexico rn with my friend‚Äôs family + the 30 YO sisters friend.  I was invited bc the brother didn‚Äôt want to go and there was extra space in the airbnb.  It‚Äôs been so bad that this is my second post on my profile about it since yesterday. 

Context: Before we went on the trip, the plan for groceries  was that I would go to the grocery store with the parents once we arrived in Mexico. This would mean i/my mom would have to have some extra money outside of my spending money for my own food.  There was supposed to be a chef to come cook whatever we wanted that we bought with the ingredients ( however that never happened idky) THAT was the plan that was talked about initially and agreed upon. 

The 2nd day of vacation the parents just went grocery shopping early in the morning that day. They did not tell me about this at all and i did not pick out my own food. The parents bought whatever they wanted (they bought bullshit) which is fine but i assumed i just didn‚Äôt have to pay anymore because no one said anything to me about still paying or about a change of plans until TODAY which is the LAST day we will be here. Today, my friend  told me that her parents just  said i still didn‚Äôt pay for my half of the groceries? I spent a lot of my spending money already. Had i known about this i would have used my money more efficiently or i would have gave them the grocery money at the very start. I would have also just bought food from restaurants since i didn‚Äôt really like what the dad cooked. not that it was the worst but not really want i wanted rn in mexico. grateful for him cooking for all of us though. 

They have been completely inconsiderate towards me and tbh to my friend (their daughter) as well on this trip. I also feel like this is completely disrespectful and inconsiderate to my mother bc she helped me a lot on this trip and was nice enough to give me spending money too. While my mother is a POS, this is completely rude towards her bc she was the one paying for the groceries for me and they didn‚Äôt even tell her that as well?  In fact I was the one who had to tell my mom and they didn‚Äôt say anything to her. The trip was a waste of a good amount of money and I didn‚Äôt even have any fun besides two times. We‚Äôve been here for a week and i leave tmr morning

Recently I was going through his ig following just out of curiosity and came across a whole bunch of people he was talking to or wanted to have some kind of relationship with beyond friends, which I won't lie upset me so I brought it to his attention, he unfollowed them, but there is still one problem he thinks it's okay to like females half naked pictures and claims that he hasn't done anything wrong because it's from the past. 

Alot of Hz female followers have private accounts but if his liking half naked pictures out in the open then there is obviously a chance that his doing the same with the people who have private accounts, I brought it to his attention that I wasn't happy with him liking half naked pictures and he blew up at me saying he already unfollowed all the people I had a problem with and since it's in the past his not wrong, however if I had to do the same thing he has done I would never hear the end of it, so AITA for getting upset that his liking half naked pictures, or am I being controlling?

156,1d7o6d6,AITA for not paying for a car that was gifted to me?,"When I graduated university, my dad bought me a slightly used 2021 Toyota Camry. It was almost a brand new car. I was eternally grateful that he did that but I also felt really guilty that they spent that kind of money on me. I knew that my dad was going to get me a car so I really encouraged him to not get something expensive. But behold, a really nice Camry. I wasn't there when he got the car. I love my dad. He always wants to support me financially. However he has never supported me emotionally due to his temper.  

I told him that I want to move out of the house. I'm moving out with friends because I live in a city where there aren't that many work opportunities and things to do. He got really angry. Told me life is extremely hard out there and everything's expensive and I should just stay at home and work. Told me he won't financially support me or give me a single dollar if I move out because I'm an adult. I am not entitled to his money. I am fine with not financially being supported by him. But it just hurts that he says that out of his anger. He's told me so many times that he would support me till the day that he dies. That it's his purpose in life. And I'm so grateful for that. And again, I am not entitled to his support or money. But it's the fact that he just switches up when I tell him that I want to move out. Tells me that I haven't thought about it enough. I told him I've moved out in the past when I was in university. I paid the rent every month without his help. He said, ""Wasn't it hard for you? Difficult for you?"" Told him it wasn't difficult being independent. He doesn't think I'm ready to move out. I'm 22, I graduated from university, and I'm ready to get out of this boring, lifeless city. He's also paying for my sister's brand new 2024 Toyota Corolla. She didn't ask for it but she's also super grateful. 

Apparently, he told my mom that he would only pay for both of our cars a year after we graduated university. My mom never remembers him saying that. I don't remember saying that. And if he did say that, why wasn't I there when they got the car? I would've wanted a cheaper car if I knew I had to pay for it later. Started yelling at my mom about how I want to move out and that I'm entitled and careless. He made it seem like it was a gift. Now it's on me to pay 500+ dollars a month for the car AND insurance. I don't want to do that. And I don't think my sister does either. I think we'd both rather have cheaper cars that we can pay for ourselves, rather than being bombarded with all this debt just because we move out. 

AITA for wanting my dad to pay for the car because it was a gift? I'm still working on my career. I don't have the financial means to pay for that kind of car plus the insurance.

157,1d7nvsh,AITA for telling my boyfriend‚Äôs mom her drinking makes me uncomfortable? ,"Background: My (F22) boyfriend‚Äôs (M21) mom (F49) has a history of binge drinking and yelling cruel things at her husband and her son. I have been with them on multiple occasions when her drinking has led to her threatening divorce, yelling about her husband‚Äôs inadequacy in bed or banging on her son‚Äôs door telling him he needs to move out. 
A month ago she got drunk on a trip to New Orleans and began yelling on the streets. There were little kids that had to listen to her yell inappropriate and sexual comments about her husband and people laughing at her. My parents do not drink and while I drink on occasion I have not seen parental figures other than her drunk. This experience was overwhelming and humiliating for me. I tried to tell her to calm down and she called me a bitch. I broke down crying and went back to our hotel room while her husband helped her. The police called an ambulance on her that her husband had to convince them to cancel. She came home via Uber hours later and slept for a while then woke up at 1am and began yelling at him again. I had a flight at 9am and was frustrated. She apologized the day after and vowed to get help by attending AA meetings and never did. 5 weeks later she was drinking at a pool party again and got into an argument with my boyfriend. 
This weekend we all took a trip to universal. This was the first time I had seen her since New Orleans and she apologized for what happened again. During  the trip she had a glass of wine and seeing her with a drink reminded me of the humiliation and panic I felt when I last saw her drinking. When she got a second glass of wine I said to her ‚ÄúCan I be honest, I do not appreciate you drinking right now‚Äù She responded that she didn‚Äôt appreciate some things I say and do, and accused me of ruining the trip by bringing up her drinking. This ended in me crying and her walking away. 
The next day my boyfriend shared that she felt disrespected in how I commented on her drinking. He shared that she feels she apologized for New Orleans on multiple occasions and has been working to moderate her drinking in ways I can‚Äôt see. I felt bad that she felt disrespected so I texted her an apology (I can post it in the comments if needed) and she texted me thank you. 
My boyfriend shared that he doesn‚Äôt think that she‚Äôs done anything wrong and does not owe me an apology simpy because my feelings are hurt. He believes because she only had two drinks that I am being hard on her. From my perspective, it was the first time I saw her after our trip where she got wasted and put me in an uncomfortable situation and it made me panic seeing her drinking again, even though it was a small amount. I understand I am not owed an apology but I believe that she should acknowledge how her actions affect other people and why seeing her drinking was upsetting to me.

158,1d7nc08,AITAH for telling someone to hurry up with deciding/purchasing a ps5 controller while waiting in line to purchase some beyblades with only 5 minutes before my bus leaves to the movies?,"I really feel bad for doing what I did earlier today when I was going to the movies with my partner. We bought some tickets to see a rerun of Spider-Man NWH and unfortunately the movie theater we went to to see the movie was quite the distance away and we were in a hurry to get there as we only had an hour left before the movie starts.

So long story short, recently the new generation of Beyblades has recently launched in Canada (Beyblade X) and I have been trying my best to hunt these things down. Tried Walmart and Toys R Us and didn't have any luck in the mall. Unfortunately, the last stop I tried which was Gamestop had them but we were running out of time to catch our bus. 

I wasted no time on picking the ones I needed to get to start my collection with this current generation but as I was about to purchase them I get told my the guy at the counter that he is currently attending to another customer who was having a hard time deciding which PS5 controller to get. I politely step aside and wait my turn but as I wait a few minutes my partner tells me that we needed to go now and considering that the guy in front of me was taking his sweet time on deciding which controller to get I decided to tap on his shoulder and say ""Hey, could you hurry up? I've got a bus to catch and it's about to leave and I'd like to get these things before I go. It wouldn't take that long for me to buy them."" To which he turns around and gives me a nasty look and says to me ""Could you have some decency and be patient?"" And knowing that this is going to take a long time I ultimately decided to not go through with the purchase as I had zero time left before the bus leaves

As I leave I tell my partner that I really didn't want to rush him but considering we were pressed for time I didn't really have a choice and felt bad for it at the same time. She understood and didn't make a big deal about it but I feel a bit guilty for telling someone to hurry up. I usually don't do this but considering that I was in a race against time there's nothing much I could do.

So now, this is what lead me here. AITAH for doing what I did? I personally think I am as I felt like I made a dick move as it came off as me having no patience. If the guy who I told to hurry up is out there just know I meant no harm and I'm sorry if I came across as a dick. Thanks for taking the time to answer my predicament. Really appreciate it

159,1d7me91,AITA for not driving my grandma to my aunts house?,"So my maternal grandma has been staying with us since the beginning of February this year. My grandma fell ill while living in Mexico and flew into the border line close to San Diego and needed someone to pick her up. My sister and I (I drove my sister doesn‚Äôt have a car) busted a mission out there and picked her and her partner up and took him to his daughters place and my grandma to ours (mine and my sisters). Since then she has been staying with us as my aunt (her daughter) & aunt‚Äôs husband could only tolerate having her there for about a week (she used to live with them) and she doesn‚Äôt like staying at my moms or my uncles etc. 

It is time to go back home to Mexico & she is flying out tomorrow. She just goes with the flow so doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on/what time they‚Äôre leaving etc. as her partner doesn‚Äôt tell her & she doesn‚Äôt ask. As far as I knew she would be picked up at my place and go straight to the airport close to San Diego. My aunt was here to take her somewhere (I think the bank) earlier while I was napping at around 4pm & then came straight to drop her off. Again my grandma doesn‚Äôt know any of the deets of what‚Äôs going down. They return from the bank or wherever and my aunt goes home. Fast forward 6:30 and my grandma is on the phone with her partner talking about what‚Äôs going to happen and he‚Äôs telling her to spend the night at my aunts because it‚Äôs closer to him & his daughter (or someone) will be picking her up (my aunt is about 20 minutes from me). 

They don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre going to be driven/drive out there or if they are going to take the bus (again shit that you think would be planned out in advance). My aunt was literally here not that long ago and if they had planned accordingly she could‚Äôve just took off then with my aunt. She let her partner know that my aunt had left already so he said to have me take her. We all, including my aunt stated that he should just pick her up from here but because the station they might go to is closer to my aunt than me he wants her there instead. Regardless he should pick her up, but now he doesn‚Äôt have a car, that‚Äôs why the daughter is doing it. 

It‚Äôs kinda annoying because this should‚Äôve been done planned in advance & she just allows it to happen but then gets upset when others can‚Äôt be flexible. I honestly feel like they can do the extra 20 minutes but it seems like they just want what‚Äôs convenient for them. When I had to drop him off at his daughters house in the beginning, I never stated that I could drop him off closer somewhere else because it was inconvenient for me to drop him off at his daughters house, I just did it. They should‚Äôve had this all planned out from the get go especially if he knew he wouldn‚Äôt have his own car or just make it work w his daughter.
