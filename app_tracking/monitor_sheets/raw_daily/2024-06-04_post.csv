0,1d86ef0,AITA for potentially getting my 16 y/o co-worker fired?,"I (19 ftm) work at an outdoor summer camp and have worked there for going on 6 years. I‚Äôve been out as both queer and trans for the past 4 years and while have faced discrimination within schools or from strangers, co-workers at this camp have for the most part been kind to me. While attending staff training I started taking to a co-worker (I‚Äôll call Tanner) I met last year very briefly (17M) and we got pretty close and found out the other is queer. Because of how large staff is, our trainings are split into 2 groups and I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to have Tanner in my group each time so we talk and spend a lot of time together at the training. After one of the most recent trainings I got home a bit later and saw Tanner had texted me screenshots from a group chat he had been in for over a year where other counsellors had taken pictures of the both of us from behind and beside us throughout the trainings and captioned it with homophobic and transphobic slurs. Following that, multiple counsellors discussed how ‚Äòfagish‚Äô the two of us have become over the year. Tanner has dealt with harassment from these co-workers for a while but has been scared to do anything however I am not. I instructed him to take screenshots of every single thing he could while on the groupchat and send them to me as I drafted an email to supervisors and HR as well as highlighted sections of our camps code of conduct policy as well as anti bullying and harassment. I sent off multiple emails to all personnel‚Äôs above with videos and pictures but decided to reach out to the girl (16 F who I‚Äôll call Paige) who took the most pictures and videos to ask if she had called me the f and T slur upfront. When she texted back she responded saying ‚ÄòI did say that but I have the utmost respect for you and I‚Äôve been going through a really rough patch as of late and I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm doing this.

1,1d85n1o,AITA for cracking a joke about the displayed font in screenshots on a Facebook post?,"In a Facebook group, a member posted several screenshots of a conversation with a religious bigot about LGBT Pride but all the text was displayed in a hard-to-read font.

At any rate, I ""liked"" the post and then commented that I wish I could use both the ""Like"" and ""Angry"" reaction because I enjoyed her response in the conversation, but I strongly disliked the font, which made it very difficult to read. I even indicated in the response that my comment was intended as a bit of playful joking. 

She immediately responded that she hates that people focus on the font and not the message/purpose of her posts, but that she loves the font and she won't change it. I reiterate that it was intended as a joke and thank her for standing up for the LGBT community in her post, to which she responds ""to say that my font is making you more angry than the bigotry and homophobia displayed is indeed triggering.""

Since this is a private group and I'd rather not get suspended for a conflict, I just sucked it up and apologized while pointing out that my husband and I are LGBT (we're both trans, used to be in a lesbian relationship but he recently began his transition.)  Yes, what the bigoted person said in the screenshots was frustrating and the OP did a great job of standing up for LGBT people.

4,1d7mars,AITA for leaving my grandparents house early and causing family drama ?,"
I (22M) had an exhausting photo shoot job with my girlfriend (21F) this weekend. I hadn't slept well for 3-4 days, was dealing with my girlfriend's drama, pesky photographers, and a very rude, uncooperative driver. By the time our work ended, I was beyond tired.

My grandparents' house was nearby, and I hadn't visited in 3-4 years. I thought it would be a good time to see them and get some rest. When I arrived, I took all my cousins out for dinner. I was so tired that I passed out on the couch. The house lacks air conditioning, running water, and proper bathroom facilities, so I was literally sweating buckets while sleeping.

However, my cousins and aunts had other plans and didn't appreciate me getting some much-needed rest. They tried to wake me up by pulling, pushing, slapping, and screaming, which made me really mad and upset that they couldn't treat me like a human being.

I told them that I couldn't stay there any longer and would leave first thing in the morning. This created a huge issue, and they called my parents, who yelled at me for creating unnecessary problems.

It was such a bad experience that I don't want to visit there ever again.

Ten minutes later, Greg sent a selfie with Scoot outside Turbo‚Äôs house, asking to be let in, which made us uncomfortable since Scoot wasn‚Äôt invited.

For context, Scoot, Turbo, and Greg were in a love triangle. Greg had feelings for Scoot despite her two-timing him and Turbo. Knowing this, our group developed a distaste for Scoot. Greg and Turbo, though not close, had hung out with the group before without issues.

My oldest (8m) and third child (4f) are both signed up to go. My second child (7m) is in a grade level that is not going. I asked the school why he can't go because his older brother and younger sister are both allowed to go and have fun and I will be there with my youngest (1m) to chaperone. They told me that he cannot go and that this is a time for the kids that are going can spend with me and have fun. They said to make sure he goes to school that day and we're very firm about it. I asked how that is fair that his siblings get to have a fun field trip and he doesn't. Why is the 1st grade class not going when multiple grades above and below them are. They said that he will have a field trip to an educational place that the others don't get to go on. I said that makes no sense because his older and younger siblings already bragged about having gone to that place earlier in the year and it was boring.

After I hung up my family and I discussed pulling all of the kids that day and going to a different fun location instead. My younger two were excited about it but my oldest was upset. He understands that we are trying to be fair to all of them but he doesn't want to miss out on time with his friends. So we are back to considering just taking my middle child on the field trip anyway. I have always tried to ensure all my kids get to have fun and the school is trying to tell me it would be unfair of me to bring the one they don't want to go because somehow the kids that are going will have less fun with him there.

Update: Okay so we came up with a new plan. Kids are asleep so will talk to them tomorrow and see if they're all okay with it. We'll let the field trip go as the school plans and then take just my 1st grader on a different day this summer. Both siblings are old enough to be understanding about making sure everyone gets treated fairly. To help them all feel less left out I can find a different way to make his day at school fun without breaking school rules and then copy it for the other 2 when we take just him to the park this summer. The school has always allowed the kids to bring snacks for the whole class if they want to so I'll send him to class with cupcakes for him and his friends that day.

Update: Okay so we came up with a new plan. Kids are asleep so will talk to them tomorrow and see if they're all okay with it. We'll let the field trip go as the school plans and then take just my 1st grader on a different day this summer. Both siblings are old enough to be understanding about making sure everyone gets treated fairly. To help them all feel less left out I can find a different way to make his day at school fun without breaking school rules and then copy it for the other 2 when we take just him to the park this summer. The school has always allowed the kids to bring snacks for the whole class if they want to so I'll send him to class with cupcakes for him and his friends that day. Then give the sitter cupcakes to share with the other two while he's at the park with me later on.",1.0,0.11950526,0,0

11,1d7l2jj,AITA for going alone to a festival instead of with my friend?,"This post isnt as exciting or fierce as some stories in this reddit channel and some people probalby think I am whining or making a fuss about nothing but its been bugging me and I have been thinking about it alot:

First I wanted to give some context: My friends and I have been attending multiple raves/festivals over the past few years and we like it very much. Everytime someone suggested to go to a rave/festival, I went along with it. Its not like I went against my wishes or there were bad artists, but the specific lineup/artists were never really my choice. There was a time when I suggested some raves/festivals but these requests were rejected/played off by changing topic etc, have not suggested anything ever since.

So There is this big festival called defqon we went to last year thats organised anually and consists of multiple days. I have been passionate and excited about Defqon ever since I got into the harder styles. My friends and I had planned that we wanted to go to defqon this year and I bought saturday tickets for the group (the lineup was not yet released, but we had fun on the same day last year) So when the lineup was released, I discovered that almost none of the artists I listen to were performing on saturday, but on friday. I asked the gang if it was alright if we went friday instead of saturday (3/4 people didnt really care about the lineup, but one other person did) We had a discussion about this and it ended with the me promising to go to another festival with him which he told me about, that had the same music genre as Defqon saturday. Everything was settled and the plan was to go friday.

When the gang gathered at a birthday party, 2 friends told me they couldnt go on friday since they had to request leave from work. They asked me if it was alright if we went on saturday because of this reason. As much as it pained me to go saturday, I told them it was fine and we could go saturday if there was really no other way, so that we could go as a whole group. (It pained me to go saturday because this is the festival I have been waiting a whole year for since we went last year and the lineup of friday is a once in a lifetime experience. The artists I listen to are not to be found on other events or are really scarce.)

1 week later, we bought the partybus tickets for Saturday, but the same 2 friends told me that they maybe can not make it because of school exams in that semester and are doubting. We unfortunately already bought the party bus tickets and my reason to go saturday has vanished if they decide not to go. I kind of feel a bit betrayed and made it clear that I want to go friday, if they decide to skip this festival. The other person said that he will go alone if I wont join him on Saturday now.

12,1d7kny9,AITA for cancelling my family vacation due to conflict from over 10 years ago?,"My parents (60s) invited me (mid 20s) and a friend to join their international vacation this fall. They booked the resort in January/February after confirming in December that I might be interested, but they said I don‚Äôt have to say yes. They let me and my sibling bring one guest each. My parents are paying for the lodging, and I would get a private room with my friend. I confirmed me and my friend‚Äôs attendance in February because I didn‚Äôt know that I would end up going low contact with my parents. I cancelled our RSVP (with my friend‚Äôs consent) in May because I worried it would be bad for my health, especially after what would be an 8+ month period of barely tolerating talking to my mother on the phone for 5 minutes/month.  

My parents are very hurt and upset. When politely asked for an explanation, I told them that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in my best interests to see them for a while, including them coming to visit me. (My father used to be very abusive when me and my sibling were growing up, and I have been diagnosed with PTSD due to those experiences.) I didn‚Äôt elaborate, and they haven‚Äôt inquired any further. Our family history is the elephant in the room that we never talk about despite my clumsy attempts. There have been no efforts on their part to identify or resolve any issues, though that could be because they‚Äôre trying to give me space.

I‚Äôm not trying to punish my parents. I‚Äôm sure they thought of this as a fun experience that we never could have dreamt of affording when I was growing up. Part of me feels guilty because my dad has made some efforts over the years to be better, and I know my parents had only good intentions with this trip. I wonder if my cancellation is like demanding that they be better, only to then shred their gift/efforts while they watch. In theory, I could have endured the stress leading up to the trip and probably had some amount of fun at the resort while avoiding rocking the boat.

Valentine‚Äôs Day came up and I will admit, I was a little disappointed he didn‚Äôt get me a flower or a card but he said it wasn‚Äôt a special day and I felt a little silly for placing any importance on it. 

His birthday this year, I bought a bunch of balloons, the kind which spell out ‚Äúhappy # birthday‚Äù a dozen regular balloons and a little party hat. We got into an argument because he told me to get off my phone, and I told him I was in the middle of a sale (I have a small, maybe even tiny side hustle where I sell plants and art‚Äù. I was on the phone for maybe 5 minutes closing the sale via text message and he got pissed and said he was going to leave. I told him I was barely on the phone, what I was doing and asked why he was going. He tells me that I didn‚Äôt spend time with him on his birthday and didn‚Äôt listen when he told me to get off my phone. I felt so guilty for doing something so stupid and what I thought to be insignificant. 

I was hurt because my effort to try and make the day special seemed looked over, even though I only bought him balloons. Beforehand I had asked him if there was anything he wanted as a gift and he maintained he didn‚Äôt want anything. I told him that I was trying to make the day special and that he didn‚Äôt even care for my effort. I stupidly brought up Valentine‚Äôs Day where we didn‚Äôt do anything special and he said that I didn‚Äôt get him anything either (except a card). 

This matters because I was out today and decided to buy him a comic and a cute bouquet of flowers, to show him appreciation. When I handed it to him he just looked at the comic and said the flowers looked dry. He didn‚Äôt even take it when I handed it to him, I had to tell him to hold it and he just started talking about where he parked the car. It really ruined my mood and he told me to stop acting like an A-hole and that I only get him presents I like. I wanted to cry when he said that. I don‚Äôt know why. 

Am I really an asshole? He gives no clues to what he wants but complained I didn‚Äôt get him anything and when I do it‚Äôs what I like. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-04,"AITA for gifting my non-materialistic partner gifts ‚ÄúI like‚Äù? I (31F) am dating my boyfriend (47m), let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù. He is ‚Äúnon-materialistic‚Äù according to him, he hardly buys anything other than clothes. We‚Äôve been together for a little over 2 years and the first year for Christmas I didn‚Äôt buy him anything that I can think of although we did spend time together and I cooked dinner for us. I think I made him a card for Valentine‚Äôs Day and I made one for his birthday and Father‚Äôs Day. I design the cards in photoshop and I print it on card stock , it‚Äôs nothing special I guess but I really do put a lot of effort to make it presentable. 

Our second Christmas together we bought each other small gifts, nothing expensive or crazy.
