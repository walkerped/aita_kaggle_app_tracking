0,1d8rfzr,AITA for not declining or signing over my portion of my ex bfs life insurance payout too his mom? ,"I recently learnt that my ex bf passed away of cancer in March, his mom called me last week to inform me of his passing and to inform me that myself and her are listed as beneficiaries on his life insurance from his employer. She instantly tells me that she doesn't know why he never changed it but I can decline or sign the cheque over to her once I receive it.. 
Instantly I am in shock, he's gone? And he left me on there? Why? 
I went back and forth wondering if this was on purpose or accidental.. it had been years, approximately 6 since we mutually civily split up. 
I was informed he had a new gf that lived with him and she has 2 kids from a previous relationship that threw a wrench into things more.. is there a reason she never got put on it? Was this all just a big mistake?

Today it has been 1 week and this has been very hard especially since his mom has been terrorizing me all week trying to get me to agree to give her this money. She has said the most hurtful things, and has sent me the most disrespectful photos and video of her son in his last moments..
As of right now I haven't even gotten in touch with the insurance company, I have no idea how much this is or if I need a lawyers help at this point. 

Well today is the day I woke up knowing 100% I am keeping this money and I am not going to feel bad at all for helping my family with a gift my ex left for me. Unfortunately part of me still wonders if it's the right thing to do by my ex.. and if these were his wishes in the end.

A little info too add, my home burnt too the ground 3 years ago July 20th and October 1st 2 years ago my mom passed from cancer as well... it has been a long hard few years and this money would literally buy myself a new bra for the first time in 3 years.. my little clan could really use this money and I think my ex knew that..

1,1d8jyv2,AITA in trying to set this boundary with my coworker?,"I (MtF 24) work at a supermarket. There's one guy in particular who is a bit of a jokester, seems to like messing with people. He's probably about 60 or so.

Last shift I felt him pull on my hair. He's done this before, while comparing me to Samson from the Bible. I didn't say anything at the time, just let it go because he's old and a bit weird. I have kind of a thing about people touching my hair though, and especially someone I barely know, it's just weird and uncomfortable to me, not to mention he pulled hard enough for it to hurt.

So I asked him politely not to do it anymore. I don't mind him messing with me in other ways, I explained, just not touching my hair. He instantly started mocking me, saying things to the effect of ""ooooohh I'm a woman, don't touch my hair"". Again, I decided it wasn't worth it and let it go.

Then about 30 minutes later he comes up to me and starts arguing with me that he didn't pull my hair. I tell him he did, because I felt it, but he explains no, he actually flicked my head with his finger. Now I can see this, I think what happened is he flicked my head and his finger caught in my hair, it's quite thick and I wear my hair in a pretty tight ponytail. 

So I tell him I believe him, and to let me explain. He interrupts me multiple times, telling me emphatically that he didn't pull on my hair. I put my earbuds back in and bring it to my manager when I get a chance. She then talked to his manager.

2,1d8js8v,AITA for refusing to show up to a family pride event after my identity was belittled?,"I (17 y/o masc presenting) came out to my parents last year on June 1st during a family pride event. My brother (22 y/o trans male) had come out to my parents as trans and received overwhelming support from my parents and family as whole.

For reference I identify as Panromantic, Asexaul, and Agender. My brother got top surgery and it had healed about a month before Pride Month of last year and so my parents decided to hold what they called a 'Pride Picnic' for the family to celebrate him. I talked to him about how I was scared to come out and he suggested doing it during the picnic so I did. I was met with massive backlash, my parents that I ""hadn't met the right person"" and ""was just a confused Pansexual"" and it really hurt me. What hurt more was that a lot of family including my parents ganged up on me, claiming that I was ruining my brothers big day.

Because my high school is not close to my house I've been living with my friend with almost no contact with my parents. Out of the blue I got a text from them three days ago as of writing this post saying that, and I quote, I was ""welcome to join the family for this years 'Pride Picinc' if I admitted my parents were right about my identity"". I refused and said I would not be doing anything with them if they're support was subjective.

Now I'm getting messages from a lot of family claiming that it was cruel of me to accuse my parents of being homophobic and unsupportive after everything they did for my brother. Claiming my parents want the best for me and it was wrong of me to suggest otherwise.

I didn't think I was in the wrong but after all the messages I'm not sure. So Reddit, AITA?

4,1d8f3l5,AITA for calling out my husband for texting with my sister?,"For context: I 30F and my husband 32M have been together 10 years. I have a big family, 6 sisters we are all extremely close. We all have children and my nieces and nephews come over a lot.

My sisters are all single mothers, every once and a while we babysit for them. Or I may ask my husband to babysit for us to go eat or something.

I’ve always been okay with this but there is some situations I don’t like. One of my sisters would just text me husband and side step me, ask for his help moving, ask if he had extra phone. I told him I don’t find that appropriate and if she needs help she should contact me. 

So the new situation is, she texted my husband saying that she lost her babysitter and could he behind watching her kid while she worked 9-5 until she could find a babysitter or daycare.

Reasons I find this strange, although my husband works from home still works. She didn’t ask me, I also work from home but go in office for a few days. Now he did tell me, and I told him reply sorry, I work so I wouldn’t be able to. And I’d later talk to her.

Instead he replied, I work and travel so I may not be reliable but I can Friday. And it just would depend on the day. 

I told him that was extremely disrespectful and inappropriate. One because he made that decision without me, knowing I’d be here if he babysit. He went against what I said. And it opens the door for him to continue contact of her asking if he can babysit. He claims he was trying to be nice and I should be mad at my sister. And I’m an AH for being upset he was being nice. 

I think it was highly inappropriate so AITA?

5,1d8f0sj,AITA for Dancing with another woman while on a date with my girlfriend ,"My girlfriend 25 year old woman asked me 24 year old man to post on here for anonymous opinions.

Something to know about me is I am an extrovert. I love going out and making friends. My favorite place to go is a cool bar in my town that has live music and swing dancing on the weekends. Before I started dating my girlfriend I would go there every week. My girlfriend is not an extrovert and that doesn't bother me. I enjoy her company and I don't mind staying at home if I'm with her. This last weekend I was feeling a little antsy so I asked my girlfriend if she wouldn't mind going out because I wanted to share my favorite place with her. When we got there I tried leading her to the dance floor but she did not want to go because she said she was embarrassed to dance in front of people. I tried to reassure her no one would be watching and if she was embarrassed because she did not know how to dance I would teach her. She still did not want to so we found a table and ordered some food and drinks.

We were having a good time having dinner together when a song I really liked to dance to started playing. I told my girlfriend ""This song is super fun to dance to. Do you want to dance with me?"" she said no. So I asked ""Do you mind if I go dance then?"". She said sure. I walked out to the dance floor and saw a woman standing on the side watching her friends dance. I walked over to her reached out my hand and asked if she wanted to dance. She accepted by taking my hand and I lead her out to the dance floor. She was a good dancer so we had a fun time. We were both laughing and smiling. After the song was over I thanked her for the dance and lead her back to her friends (a guy and a girl). I had a little small talk with them for about a minute before I thanked the woman again for the dance and returned to my girlfriend.

After a little bit of time passed and we had finished our meals the woman I had danced with came up to our table. She handed me a slip of paper. I was confused why she handed me something so on instinct I said ""Thank you"". The woman then returned to her friends who were standing a few feet back looking like they where about to leave. I said to all three of them. ""Nice to meet you guys"" and waved goodbye. The girl who was the friend of the girl I danced with said ""you to, maybe we will see you here again"" and they left. I turned back to my girlfriend who was scowling at me. She got up and left the bar. I went to the bar and paid the bill and followed after her. Because I stayed and paid the bill my girlfriend was already in the car.

When I got in the car we started arguing. She said I should not have danced with the girl because she was clearly flirting with me and she did not like how she took my hand. I told her grabbing hands is the way people do it because it would be weird to ask someone to dance and then walk away expecting them to follow. She then said ""I did not know you were going to ask another girl to dance or I would not have let you"". I told her I asked her to dance first and she would not. I wanted to dance thats why we came to this place in the first place. She then accused me of flirting back to her because we were laughing and keeping eye contact and if I really was not flirting I would not have accepted her phone number. I told her I did not know it was her phone number because she caught me off guard and I was not going to rip it up in front of her. She then said ""If you cared about my feelings you would have ripped it up"". I told her I don't think talking to women is something I should not be allowed to do and It is not my fault she gave me her phone number.

We never had issues before or judged neighbor. Extremely friendly with her and cordial almost close with her. Neighbor has always asked for a million favors since we moved in and became friendly with her, since I am a sahm I never minded, walking her dog, helping her through two surgeries, barrowing groceries, etc. She's crossed boundaries even asking to barrow a bottle of wine because she's been so desperate for a drink, etc. 

Neighbor parent support her financially and she has been through her second creepy unemployed boyfriend, and now recently started dating a new man who she moved in after 2 months of knowing, the guy drives her car around, doesn't go to work, stands outside her house sometimes, just acts and gives myself and the other neighbors the creeps. 

I have a large dog, our complex rules are to always have the dogs on leash, my neighbor has always opened her front door let her small dog out to pee off leash in front lawn and then calls her back inside, unfortunately said little shit dog will not listen and charge at anything she sees, lazy drunk neighbor will not chase after her but will just call her. This happened about 10 times while I am walking my dog now heavily pregnant daily at night since my husbands work hours, my dog would not do anything but I am afraid of her dog scaring mine and me getting hurt between the two because it's happened before and I pull my dog back and run away. 

After the 10th time I said to her ""put your dog on a leash, everyone else does it, I'm 8 months pregnant and don't want to get hurt"" I assume neighbor had been drinking like she does every night, she called me and cursed me out, told me to keep my toddler away from her front lawn which was irrelevant and that I am a rude, nasty person, bitch, etc out of nowhere.

7,1d8e6n2,AITA for not accepting my parents' pool?,"Last summer my parents put in a pool in our backyard, but the thing is its an above ground pool. Ive never really thought fondly of those.

I joined my school a few years ago and wasn't popular, however over this past year ive been talking to a lot of people and hanging out with them. Just a few weeks ago I had an awesome birthday party and people loved it and had a great time. I always promise these people for the best experience possible when they hang out with me, so when my parents told me that they were putting in a pool I was super exited, however It is an above ground one witch kind of caught me off guard.

I'm not trying to sound spoiled im just trying to give my new friends the best possible time and make them want to come over again and I think building a deck around the pool would really help me in achieving that.

Just recently a girl in my class came up to me and asked whether it was above ground or inground, I doged the question immedetly. Over this passed week ive tried to convince my parents to put in a deck witch they said yes but its not a deck its more of a patio. Im honestly just considering inviting everybody to my grandmother's beach house instead. But the thing is I dont want to upset my parents, I just feel like if I go through with it and Invite people over they will not think its that good. I know that I sound extreamly entiteld but please look at it from my perspective. I live in a nice area, Ive never reallly been popular over the past few years and im finally sucseeding in school with other people/classmates only for this to happen, I dont know what to think, its alot of pressure when people ask about it.

8,1d8dyl5,AITA for being angry with my parents for letting my brother skip my graduation?,"I (17F) am graduating in 2 days. Yesterday my mom told me, very casually, that my brother (10) wont be at graduation. I was shocked and upset and I asked her why. She told me he has a baseball game and immediately I was hurt, not only because my brother is willing to skip an important day in my life for one baseball game, but because my parents were so quick to allow him to do that. I understand that a graduation wouldn’t be exciting for him, he’s 10 and I don’t expect him to enjoy sitting around for a few hours, but there’s a part of me that thought he would still want to come because we are close. I’m mostly upset with my parents allowing it, like I said, because that just feels ridiculous to me. If I were to miss my brothers graduation by choosing some other event to go to, everyone would be so angry with me. Not that I feel like they’re playing favorites, but I just don’t understand why they would let it slide like that. This is is the little league, it would be different if college scouts were going to be there. 

Anyways, my mom told me that she didn’t understand why I was so upset and I can just talk to my brother about it, so I asked him at dinner why he didn’t want to come. He just said sorry, so then I turned to my parents and told them I was mad they were letting him skip my graduation. They were surprised and told me it’s not fair for me to be upset with anyone after I made it seem like it wasn’t important for family to be there (because I told them I didn’t want my estranged father to come, my “parents” is referring to my mom and stepdad, as well as me not inviting my two great grandmothers, even though it wouldnt be a good environment for them because it’s extremely hot outside and the bleachers are extremely crowded and not convienient for elderly) and I never had an interest in sports or extracurriculars so I couldn’t understand why this was important enough for him to miss my graduation. They also said that it wasn’t like he was going to be gone all night and I could see him after

My brother started crying while I was fighting with my parents and I felt bad. I started to feel like the AH because this game is important to my brother and maybe I shouldn’t be so aggressive about him coming. I went upstairs after and my parents had sent my brother up to my room to apologize for him not coming.

I want to know if Im in the wrong because I can’t help but feel so sad that my only sibling isn’t going to be there for the only graduation Im going to have, and In eight years I’ll be going to his, and while I’ll be happy to celebrate him, I’ll remember he wasn’t there for mine.

10,1d8djk7,AITA for separating my chores from the rest of the family?,"I, 22M, live with my mother, her significant other, and my younger siblings. I have been trying to get my feet underneath me for a while now since I have finished college and moved back home last year (a full year home as of last month). My weekends and Wednesdays are the days I work. Unfortunately for me, I haven't been able to find a full time job since moving back.

Through the week, I typically spend that time playing games, and taking care of my siblings when they need something. However, I refuse to pick up after them.

Now, where does that all fall into the issue at hand you may ask? Let me tell you. I have taken a parent/guardian role for my younger siblings. This is not a new thing for me as I have changed their diapers and cooked for them all the time. For a little context, they are now 15 and 12. I was hoping that two years away from home would have matured them a bit to pick up after themselves, but it has gone way down hill.

My mother and her boyfriend have a bit of a hoarding issue. Doesn't help that the boyfriend has no job, not even part time, yet can't pick up after his own five year old. This all leads to basic chores not getting done around the house. That leads to me getting yelled at for not carrying my weight around the house.

I should clarify, I pay for my own bills. I even got a food stamp card and tossed it to my mother since she was having hard a hard time with how expensive food has been getting.

All of this led to me taking care of only my dirty laundry, my dirty dishes, mowing the lawn, and staying in my room to avoid seeing the other people in the house.

The dishes and messes around the house were only getting worse.

I had just finished mowing the lawn where I ran over a total of 6 pairs of socks that had been left outside and I went inside and got a little heated with my siblings about how I tell them to pick up their stuff outside. I tell them time and time again. So, like I said, I just ran them over. At least this time they didn't leave random gardening tools around. 

My mother decided to step in and yell at me about how I never do anything around the house. About how mowing the lawn includes picking up all the toys, socks, and other random things left outside.

I replied to all of her rant with, ""My dad would do the exact same thing I did. Yes, it sucked to not find the toy I loved. However, I knew it was my fault that they were gone in the first place. Why do you thing I pick up my shit now?""

This didn't help anything. It only fanned the flames. It was not the reaction I had anticipated.

It led to an even bigger rant about my dad not being that great of a dad.

Either way, I decided to bite my tongue and just went back to my room where I am typing this now.

So, am I the asshole? I know I am not innocent. I shouldn't have let my anger get to me. I think we are all assholes.

My husband’s sister said the date would not work for her so we cancelled. Unfortunately the venue is fully booked for September. So we talked about October.

November weather in my area is unpredictable and I would really like some nice photos in good weather. I already canceled an ideal date in September. Also my sister will have a lot of trouble making it for November because she is still a fellow in training so she lacks the flexibility that all other siblings have.

Am I being unreasonable for insisting on October? Should I be planning around her schedule?

I live across the country  from her so I can't just up and travel. I noticed over that time Ashley would ask for things or complain about feeling that her friends and her child's father are not doing enough for her or being around enough for her. I would do what I can with the monetary requests she has made and reach out to check in when I could. I told her that I am very annoyed by her complaining and she needs to accept that my life does not stop just because she had a baby. She responds by saying ""I almost died giving birth"". I responded that she has said this every time I have spoken to her when she complains about something. I also said that she cannot make monetary requests, complain afterwards, throw almost dying in my face, then make more requests like I'm an unlimited ATM. She said that until I experience what she has then I won't understand where she is coming from and being there for her in these ways shows how important she and the baby are in my life. I responded that in the time since she gave birth I have injured my foot and can barely walk which led to unexpected financial problems and have other challenges in my life that she does not even ask about. I said I was not in the bedroom when she got pregnant so she needs to take this up with the man who knocked her up. We haven't spoken since then and I refuse to help her anymore as long as she acts this entitled.  AITA? 

EDIT: Ashley's child's father is in the picture.  He has been getting complaints from her about not being at the hospital enough.

21,1d93k2x,AITA for not taking communion at my grandfather's funeral?,"My (33F) grandfather's funeral was last week. It was obviously a pretty somber event but the family all knew it was coming, he was very old and his health had been declining for years. I was actually able to be the last grandchild who saw him at the hospital the day before he passed away.

My grandfather was a lifelong Catholic like most of my family and so had a Catholic funeral. I was raised Catholic but I no longer am, I actually converted to a non-denominational church and was even rebaptized in my mid-20s although I'm not actively in any church now, but even if I ever did return to any it wouldn't be Catholic which I strongly disagree with on obvious matters of sexuality and status of women. This was the first Catholic mass I had attended in almost a decade.

During the funeral the priest announced communion and because many non-Catholics were present also stated that only Catholics were allowed to take it, but non-Catholics could come up with their arms crossed over their chest for a blessing. That is what I did. I was probably the only direct family member who did so (one of my uncles but he was just my grandfather's son-in-law by marriage and was never Catholic.)

24,1d9367a,WIBTA For Missing My Cousin's Wedding because She Didn't Send Me My Own Invitation,"This is petty, to be honest, but I'll give some backstory, so maybe it will make a little more sense. 
So I (26F) have a large extended family, like 10 cousins, most of whom have multiple kids now large. Despite being one of the oldest (3rd), I'm still kind of treated like a child. I believe this is because my family has a habit of having kids pretty young (e.i., Lots of teen moms and even those who plan for children have had them in their early twenties) and I'm child-free. It irks me since I've always been pretty independent, and now that I'm approaching my late 20s and have been living on my own for nearly 6 years, you'd think I'd get a little respect as an adult. But apparently not.
So I live about 3 hours away from where the rest of my family does, and I have been planning for months to visit for the Pride Parade held there. I live in a big city and the one they do here is just too hectic, so I prefer to go to that one. 
Well, I messaged my mom today asking when she's free so I can figure out a good time to visit with her and my siblings. She tells me not to worry about seeing just them, that we'll be able to spend plenty of time together at Cousin's(F22) wedding on Saturday. Cue confusion. I didn't know Cousin was getting married this weekend, but I didn't get any kind of invitation. I tell her that, and she's also confused because there's no reason Cousin wouldn't have invited me. I tell her it's no big deal anyways because I already have plans for that day. 
Well, I guess she mentioned something to Aunt (Cousin's mom) because she messaged me a few hours ago to tell me that I WAS invited, that I was on my mom's invitation as ""and Kids"". I tell her that that's too bad, because I already have plans for that night and that if they had really wanted me to go, they should have sent me my own invitation. I am an adult and live 3 hours away, so, of course, my mom isn't going to think I'm included in her ""and Kids"" invitation.

25,1d933o7,AITA For Talking About This Private Matter In Front of My Dad and Brother?,"I (17F) am in high school and am living with my parents and my brother (15M). For some context, my brother has been refusing to go to school because of ""bad parenting issues"" (he says) for the past month, and it has started to raise tensions in the house. Before this issue started becoming a problem, he has been a real a\*\*hole towards me and my parents for the past couple years.

Recently, I had a heated argument with my dad about said issue and I stormed off to my room. When I went into my room, which shares a wall with my brother's room, my brother proceeds to start making noises to mock me and yap about the whole situation knowing I could hear him. I went back to my mom to tell him to stop, but after she did, he just did it again. At this point I was just so mad that I couldn't just get some space and silence after getting so upset, so I went to my dad to tell him to stop my brother.

While we were talking about it my brother decides to come into the room and say stuff like ""well she butted in first"" and ""it's not a big deal"". This caused me to raise my voice and get super agitated, and my mom and dad just kept on saying ""calm down, don't be so angry"". At this point I just felt like they were just annoyed that I brought this to their attention. The icing on the cake was that while my parents were trying to tell me to stop being so agitated, my brother was smirking like he had won the argument. At that point I totally lost it. This is a roughly what was said after that:

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-05,"AITA For Talking About This Private Matter In Front of My Dad and Brother? I (17F) am in high school and am living with my parents and my brother (15M). For some context, my brother has been refusing to go to school because of ""bad parenting issues"" (he says) for the past month, and it has started to raise tensions in the house. Before this issue started becoming a problem, he has been a real a\*\*hole towards me and my parents for the past couple years.

Recently, I had a heated argument with my dad about said issue and I stormed off to my room. When I went into my room, which shares a wall with my brother's room, my brother proceeds to start making noises to mock me and yap about the whole situation knowing I could hear him. I went back to my mom to tell him to stop, but after she did, he just did it again. At this point I was just so mad that I couldn't just get some space and silence after getting so upset, so I went to my dad to tell him to stop my brother.

While we were talking about it my brother decides to come into the room and say stuff like ""well she butted in first"" and ""it's not a big deal"". This caused me to raise my voice and get super agitated, and my mom and dad just kept on saying ""calm down, don't be so angry"". At this point I just felt like they were just annoyed that I brought this to their attention. The icing on the cake was that while my parents were trying to tell me to stop being so agitated, my brother was smirking like he had won the argument. At that point I totally lost it. This is a roughly what was said after that:

26,1d92oxg,AITA for yelling at my stepdad?,"I (16f) live with my mom, stepdad, and my 3 year old brother. My dad died when I was 14. 



My dad was the best dad in the world, and I miss him every day. He was kind, patient, gentle, and loving, and just like me, he loved sports. Whenever he could, he would take me to basketball, baseball, and hockey games. We would then spend hours analyzing the game afterwards, and these discussions with him helped me realize that when I grow up, I want to be a sportscaster. I remember that when I first told him this, the first thing he said was “which network do you want to work on and which sport do you want to cover?” He always supported me in whatever I wanted to do, and told me anything was possible as long as I worked hard.



My stepdad is a great guy. He’s kind, respectful, and a good person. However, yesterday he offered to adopt me and my brother, saying that he’s basically our dad now. I politely declined, telling him that while I love him, I also loved my dad, and I’m not ready for such a big step. He then tried to argue that my brother thinks of him as “dad” and it’s unfair to deny the opportunity to my brother. I told him that we should let my brother decide when he’s older, seeing as I show him pictures of our dad often and tell my brother stories about him. To further prove my point, I took my stepdad to where my brother was. I showed my brother two pictures, one of our dad and one of our stepdad, and asked him to point to our dad. He chose the correct picture and said “that’s daddy”. That made my stepdad mad, and he insisted that my brother had no idea what he was talking about. This pushed me over the edge, and I yelled at him, “You’re NOT my dad, and you never will be! My dad is dead, and he’s never coming back!” 



Am I the asshole for yelling at my stepfather? He’s usually kind and understanding about my whole situation.

27,1d92ifp,AITA for not putting enough effort into the relationship with my in-laws?,"My wife and I have been together since high school... we are now 30.

My in-laws are some of the most controlling, judgmental, and manipulative two people I have ever met, so needless to say I don't have a great relationship with them.  I am always very cordial and go to every family vacation and event (for my wife), but I honestly dread being around them. 

For example, my wife and I live in Illinois, but my immediate family and my in laws both live in the same area (where we are originally from).  Whenever we go home, my in-laws will literally comment about how I'm spending way more time with my family than I do seeing them.  For example, I'll go over for dinner and then they'll make comments to my wife about me ""running out the door"" to see my family, rather than staying over.  Most in-laws would seemingly understand that I don't get to see my family often, so when I'm home they are the priority.  Not my in-laws. They have even commented that next time I come home they are going to track how much time I split between my family and seeing them. 

  
Fast forward... My father in-laws 60th bday party is coming up, so my wife and I decided that we are going to fly her in for the party.  Rather than my in-laws being excited that she is flying in for the party, they are PISSED that I am not also flying in. 

My rationale for not going is that between the extra plane ticket and finding someone to watch out dog, that would be an extra $600 at a minimum (and we are expecting our first child in September, thus are in money saving mode). 

My mother in law recently texted my wife a long message about how hurt she is that I couldn't find it in my heart to attend my FIL's bday party and that she has noticed for a long time that I do not give any effort to their family.

My husband and I both make well over six figures.  But we work long hours and as a result when we are not working or at the gym working out, we just want to veg out.

So, we (when not working) will generally make breakfast but order out lunch and dinner or go out to eat.  If we are working, we eat out all three meals.   Our loans are paid off, we own our condo, and we have no children. So, eating/ordering out makes us happy.  We also have a cleaning lady come twice a week to clean out home and do our laundry.

Our parents came to visit and were upset that we didn't cook for them the whole week except for breakfast (we took the week off because we both knew both sets of parents were coming).  We told them we don't cook except for breakfast but our condo is right next store to a plaza that has a grocery, and they are welcome to cook if they like.  But there were quite a few restaurants that we have yet to take them to so why not try one of them? They got on us on how much money we were spending, and my MIL got on me when the cleaning lady came and said I should be doing the cleaning b/c she worked and cleaned and took care of kids so she doesn't get why I can't. Which pissed me off so I went off and told her ""Because I'm not super woman, have no desire to be and refuse to try and if she wants a participation trophy for being over worked and under paid, she can head to the bar and have a shot of Jameson."" I then told her and my parents that I did not spend 4 years in college and two in graduate school to play Florence from The Jeffersons (it’s an 80s show that my parents love to watch).  So, they went on to complain about how much money we were ""wasting"". My husband told them that it is not their money its ours and we don't consider it a waste. We told them the last thing we want to do when we get off from work is cook and clean.  My husband told his mom that he never understood why she would work herself to the bone like that even when he and his sisters tried to pitch in and help, she insisted on doing everything herself. I told her I will not be doing that.

So, they went on about an emergency fund. We told them before we started living the way we do we made sure our student loans were paid off and we each have a year's salary saved up plus investments, so we are good thank you. My dad tried to be intrusive and ask how much money we both made, and we said, ""None of your business!!!"" at the same time, which made us both laugh but they were not laughing. They didn't like our reaction and felt we were wasting money.  We told them if they have a problem with our lifestyle, they could all leave. So, they ubered to a hotel. We really didn't want them to leave just to drop the subject.

So, are we idiots for telling them they could leave?

  
UPDATE: I've texted both sets of parents and told them I'm sorry for what I said and want them to come back as I never wanted them to leave. That I know what I said about them leaving was out of line, I just wanted to drop the subject but my way about it was wrong.  I told them whether they decide to come back I would like to reimburse them for the hotel rooms.

We told them that our finances are our business and though we told them that if they didn't like it, they could leave we were not literal when we said it. We just wanted to drop the subject.

Problem is, is that we don't get a long and we don't see eye to eye on how things should be in the house. We are all on the lease together and all pull our own weight with rent, but my mom treats brother and I like we are still children living in her house and tries to ""rule the roost"". She has always been manipulative and cold and mean. She had made plans to move out with a friend of hers, so my brother and I made our own plans to find a place together when the lease is up, which would have been 12 months time by then. We told her that we would be doing this and she didn't have much to say about it. Now, her plans didn't work out with her friend and I've reiterated to her that my brother and I plan on still moving out. Now she is accusing me of screwing her over and leaving her homeless.

Our lease is up at the beginning of next year, leaving 7 months from now for her to figure out what she is going to do. Staying here is not at option, I honestly don't want to live with my brother either because he's a bit of an asshole in his own right. The thing is we all don't get along living together and honestly only are because of the split cost, but my mom is making me feel like im the jerk for telling her that I'm sticking with my plans to move out, and is lashing out at me because she doesn't like it.

I'm 36F and live with my 59 Mom and 37M Brother, we share a flat together. Problem is, is that we don't get a long and we don't see eye to eye on how things should be in the house. We are all on the lease together and all pull our own weight with rent, but my mom treats brother and I like we are still children living in her house and tries to ""rule the roost"". She has always been manipulative and cold and mean. She had made plans to move out with a friend of hers, so my brother and I made our own plans to find a place together when the lease is up, which would have been 12 months time by then. We told her that we would be doing this and she didn't have much to say about it. Now, her plans didn't work out with her friend and I've reiterated to her that my brother and I plan on still moving out. Now she is accusing me of screwing her over and leaving her homeless.

Our lease is up at the beginning of next year, leaving 7 months from now for her to figure out what she is going to do. Staying here is not at option, I honestly don't want to live with my brother either because he's a bit of an asshole in his own right. The thing is we all don't get along living together and honestly only are because of the split cost, but my mom is making me feel like im the jerk for telling her that I'm sticking with my plans to move out, and is lashing out at me because she doesn't like it.

I guess you could say I have oldest daughter syndrome. But overall, I love my siblings, and for the older ones, they can take care of themselves for the most part

My parents don't normally leave the country but lately a relative of my dad's died and they have to go back to Austria soon to attend the funeral and other things like that. Neither me nor my siblings knew them well so we are not attending, plus travel costs.

Things came to conflict when my parents told me that my closest brother (16) and I would be taking care of my siblings alone. All of them. We suggested anything. Hiring someone, bringing in a friend of my parents', anything really. But they turned it down. They are solitary and don't like the idea. 

I told my parents that I was in university and my brother was in highschool and we have a large amount of responsibilities we need to meet right now, especially with the end of the school year.

35,1d910a3,WIBTA for confronting my friend for having a crush on someone who made their life hell?,"Everyone has nicknames. No one is related just a large friend group. 
Context: after reconnecting with my friend kit and being welcomed into the friend group meeting our cast kit/kitty, Malice (problem 1), Soren (Problem 2), cheese, Space, Emmy, Skip, Edd and B-soda. In the start Malice and Kit just got into a poly with emmy, cheese was already in a poly with them.
The story: It mostly started with whenever I wanted to hangout in a group with Malice, Soren, Kit, and I (I don't mind others) but whenever kit would have to go (or anyone eles) and it was just me Malice and Soren they would ask if I could leave so they could stay by themselves. They would do this to everyone but Kit (odly begging kit to stay) and had told Skip they were annoying for absolutely no reason.

A little later on Soren started ignoring me (Not saying Hi to me, pretending I don't exist, talking to kit and not me right infront of me not even looking at me ect.) And started pulling away Malice from everyone even if the whole group is there. After a week of this Malice lashed out at Soren and told them to KYS for being a dick to everyone (that much I do not agree with. Don't tell people to KYS kids.) And ran off. Soren proceeded to tell everyone except me (I had Kit tell me) what happened in a very ""I'm the victim"" heavy way.

The friend group split. Me, Cheese, Skip, eventually B-soda were team Malice. Kit, Space, Edd were team Soren. Emmy stays nutral mostly but switches to team Kit.
At this time Kit and Malice broke up. 

Space started spreading misinformation about Malice's sexuality and preferences that I debunked with exact word of mouth from them, and about them faking being a therian (B-soda is a theiran). (Malice is panpoly not aroace). I didn't say anything but warned Malice of Kit planning to confess to Edd (that malice did not like who had a history of hurting and bullying people for rage bait and pity) as a way to get back at them. Soren was going to be in no way present. Kit backed out and I talked to them getting them on team Malice along with everyone except cheese (we haven't talked in months just like Soren) after a while Kit and their brother started a roleplay thing called ""group"" that had daily meetings. Malice and Space were apart of it but Malice was kicked out fir not attending three times (They have an abusive mother and can't use electronics that much nowadays) and Kit and Malice broke up again.

This is in the past week. Cheese switched sides to Soren and have been talking to them with Kit this whole time without telling anyone but space. Space told me and had put me in a pickle. I want to confront kit because I told them everything soren did to everyone and them. I have everyone's story at this moment except Soren and Cheese's. Kit has a crush on Soren as Space has told me.

41,1d902sp,AITA for not mourning my father’s death?,"My (M42) father (82) passed earlier this year.  He had been suffering from dementia for several years prior and by the time he was near his end, he was a mere shadow of his former self.  What was left was a very nasty man who refused outside nursing assistance and required that my mother take care of him full time.  She couldn’t leave the house for more than a few minutes at a time and, as a result, missed several milestone events of my life. 

My relationship with my father throughout my lifetime has been…distant.  He wasn’t abusive nor was he physically absent.  He took me fishing and to sporting events.  He financially provided for me and paid for my college education.  Of those things, I am very appreciative.  What he lacked is effort to connect with me emotionally.  I always felt dismissed and an annoyance in his presence.  The youngest of three children, I felt like he favored my older siblings over me.  As a child, I tried to change my own personality to be more like my older brother (who is very different from me) in an effort to gain more of my father’s favor, which just ended up turning me into a confused mess.  As I grew older, I was often criticized for my interests and viewpoints.  Unless I did exactly what he thought I should do, it was never good enough.

My (M42) father (82) passed earlier this year.  He had been suffering from dementia for several years prior and by the time he was near his end, he was a mere shadow of his former self.  What was left was a very nasty man who refused outside nursing assistance and required that my mother take care of him full time.  She couldn’t leave the house for more than a few minutes at a time and, as a result, missed several milestone events of my life. 

My relationship with my father throughout my lifetime has been…distant.  He wasn’t abusive nor was he physically absent.  He took me fishing and to sporting events.  He financially provided for me and paid for my college education.  Of those things, I am very appreciative.  What he lacked is effort to connect with me emotionally.  I always felt dismissed and an annoyance in his presence.  The youngest of three children, I felt like he favored my older siblings over me.  As a child, I tried to change my own personality to be more like my older brother (who is very different from me) in an effort to gain more of my father’s favor, which just ended up turning me into a confused mess.  As I grew older, I was often criticized for my interests and viewpoints.  Unless I did exactly what he thought I should do, it was never good enough.

She hadn't really spoke much about the wedding and when all the bridesmaids met up, it seemed like one of them was already planning everything so I just assumed I was another bridesmaid which is fine. Then I got a text basically saying ""oh you're maid of honour by the way"" on a random day, I was a bit disappointed she didn't ask and just assumed and didn't really make it seem special, but it's her wedding and not mine. 

Now what's really pissed me off is the hen do, she wanted to spend 2 nights in central London with all her bridesmaids in a nice air bnb and everyone's budget was £100 each for two nights... impossible right? Anyway I spent hours, days and months looking for something suitable, I even tried to convince them you won't find somewhere suitable for that price but maybe more around the £150 mark... they still didn't want to budge, so she called me up the other day and told me that's still what she wanted to do but maybe we'll try another city, so I was like okay I'll try and find somewhere else that's not a problem.

well I was still struggling as it's late in the year and her hen do date was very specific so it's difficult, I posted a place in the group chat and said look I know it's more expensive but it's literally impossible to find something, what do you girls think?

45,1d8z22f,AITA (28f) for Refusing to Fund My Entitled Sister's (14f) Summer of Complaints and Drama?,"I helped raise my sister and our brother (18m). They acted like normal kids, and I often got chewed out by our mom (55f) for complaining about it. I had no one to care for me, and our parents were more lenient with them than with me. I was parentified at 10 when my brother was born. Earlier this year, I encouraged my sister to stay with us due to some things that happened to her. I wanted to protect her and keep her mind off things, but apparently, that’s not good enough since I don’t have the money to be a cash cow for her.

We have only been home for THREE days; she’s been hiding in her room most of the time, but when she comes out, she complains about things, like how we don’t have soda, ice cream, and chips. She can’t handle that the kids (7m, 5f, 2m) are loud and occasionally talk back. I’ve explained that’s how kids are, especially kids who are ND and on medications for a neurological condition that causes behavioral problems. She’s been complaining since the day we got home that she’s bored and wants to go home. I told her she hasn’t given me a chance to figure out plans for us. The other day, she told me, “I wish you guys had money so you could take me shopping and buy whatever I want.” I told her, “Just going on this California trip and two summer birthdays within 3.5 weeks of each other is using up any extra money I’d have.”

She asked yesterday if I could meet our parents halfway after we get back from California, which would be July 4th. I told her no, I can’t do that because I won’t have the money to drive 7 hours one way to drop her off with our parents. She also wants to do stuff without my kids because they’re too much for her. Before she came to stay with us, I explained that the kids are with me 24/7 because my husband (28m) works two jobs, so time away from my kids is extremely rare.

I have our mom telling me how to parent/discipline my kids, all while enabling my sister to leave July 4th. I already have plans for July 4th with my three kids. My parents will cancel their trip to visit us in August if they come and get my sister in July, which I think is unfair to my kids, as they only get to see their grandparents once a year (we live in separate states). My mom is enabling my sister and told me it’s my fault for pushing her to stay the whole summer. I get that she’s bored, wants space, is homesick, anxious, and having weed withdrawals.

I’ve told her and our mom that if she decides to go home right after we return from California (end of June to beginning of July), then she’s not going with us. I’ll be spending over $1k for her plane ticket (we willingly paid for this), a ticket to Universal, food, and souvenirs just for her to go home as soon as we get back. That makes me feel extremely used, and I’m not okay with that.

She doesn't always share these things with her dad, and sometimes outright asks me not to do that. They have a sometimes tense relationship at times.

Tonight she was extra sensitive, because of some ongoing friendship issues at school. I hinted at this to her dad to explain her behaviour to try to provoke some sympathy and extra patience because he has gotten angry with her crying twice in the span of a few hours. Instead I got pressed to go into details of these issues, which I wasn't comfortable to do since she shared them to me in confidence. 

He tells me I'm trying to cut him out. I responded that no, she is  the one doing that if she refuses to share with him. Honestly he could just sit down and ask her in a calm moment and she'd probably tell him anyways.

Jane moved in three months ago and we had a lot of unexpected trouble with the building's management office because our building is on a rent strike - for brevity's sake, I won't get into why but basically management wouldn't put Jane on the lease or let her pay rent unless Mary and I also paid rent, which we weren't going to do on principal.  Long story short, Jane moved in without being put on the lease and ended up joining the rent strike since she didn't have much of a choice.

Jane is a refugee and sends money back to her family, but at the same time she isn't exactly frugal. She spends without a second thought and is going on a trip to Europe. Mary and I aren't exactly well off, either.

My husband is also very helpful. I know he's tired after work so I don't ask him to do much on weekdays. Most of the time he'll play with the kids and I'll clean up after we eat. Weekends we do everything together; laundry, cooking, cleaning etc. 

I'm very lucky to have a hardworking husband who makes enough so I don't have to work. My sister, on the other hand, is single. That's fine, our parents never pressured us to marry. We were lucky in that sense as culturally it's quite common for families to pressure young girls to marry. 

She seemed happy and independent. But she has been looking for a husband and since then, she has been criticising my relationship with my husband. She calls him lazy and unhelpful. This afternoon she came to our house and started talking about how he is controlling. She said he must not let me work because he's scared that I'll become smart and independent. She told me I worked so hard to get a law degree and because of him I didn't put it to good use. She said what we have isn't love and I'm just naive.

I've told her time and again that I do not appreciate how she speaks about him and that he is not unhelpful because he provides for his family. That he is not controlling, I knew before I even married him that I would stay home if I ever had children. And we have 4 children. Not to give TMI but we love each other regularly. I understand how someone from the outside might be concerned, but she knows our relationship. I've never once expressed any interest in going back to work. Nor have I ever complained about how our home is run. I just find her to be disrespectful and rude, to my husband and me. 

I told her if she continued to talk about my husband like that, she would no longer be welcome in our home. She called me an ungrateful bitch and said she's just looking out for me. Now my husband is back from work and he has some clue as to what's been happening but I didn't tell him what she said today. I don't want him to have to hear those things when he's an amazing father and an even better husband. 

So, AITA for kicking my sister out after she called my husband controlling? My husband is normally my moral compass but since he doesn't know what happened, I thought I'd type it out here. I don't think I'm in the wrong but maybe I was being too harsh? She does seem stressed trying to find a husband so maybe this was just her way of letting that stress out.

I may have gone to far.

My now wife divorced her ex when her three kids were young. He was an addict. She met me a few years later and we dated for two years beofre she introduced me to her kids. Two kids really hit it off and Kelly did not like me. Just passive aggressive stuff but it became much worse when her dad passed away.

She did not take it well and resulted in a lot of outbursts, I wasn't living there at this time. She went into therapy but overall didn't seem like it helped. She threatens to run away if I married their mom. So I stayed away but continue to date their mom. Overtime the two other kids started to stay at my place in order to get away from the drama. It was a rough time for them and we bonded even more.

When Kelly was 18 the two of use decided to stop putting our life on hold and get married. Kelly hated this. The other kids were a happy though. Every interaction I have had with her as been unpleasant and I don't not see her are one of my kids 

I eventually adopted her siblings when they were 16 and 17. They asked me. During that time she destroy a lot of her siblings stuff for betraying there dad.

Now I rarely see her and I prefer it that way. The two kids have a one and off relationship. I payed for my two kids wedding.

I got a call from her asking me to pay for her wedding since I paid for the other two. I told her no. This started an argument about how it's unfair. I had enough and told her to have her dad pay for the wedding. She hung up after some lovely names

53,1d8yduv,AITA for starting a fight over dinner plans?,"So long story short, I think I’ve reached a point where I’m mentally checking out of my marriage.
It’s been a year in the works (we’ve been together for 15 including being married for 6)

We just had a baby last year and things have been rocky ever since. The issues are mainly his parents.  We had two fights this week and I need to know if I’m overreacting.

1- I had a pretty eventful Friday and Saturday and wanted to take it easy on Sunday and get some things done for a party we’re planning for our son this coming Sunday. His parents wanted to go for dinner and I told him I don’t want to today and let’s do it tomorrow. He initially agreed. A few minutes later he said he would rather do sports tomorrow after work and that it would be better for him to keep the plan on Sunday. I told him let’s see how it goes after we’re done errands and see if we have time. Fast forward we’re running errands and his parents are on the phone convincing him that we will have time for dinner today and planning on where they should go. He tells them to coordinate the plans with my parents and we’ll join if we have time. I didn’t end up going as I wanted to take it easy per my original plan and everyone else went. 
We ended up having an argument cause I felt unheard and I ended up rushing errands because he told me “we should keep errands for the weekdays so we can enjoy the weekends”. FYI: he’s done work at around baby’s bedtime so there’s barely enough time for errands during the week. 

2- his mom wanted to have us (including my parents) over for dinner. He asked me what day works this week and I told him I’d rather do it next week after the event on Sunday and he said well they want to invite them over twice during their stay implying that we should do it this week to have enough time for another one before my parents travel. I stuck to the fact that we won’t have time before the baptism. Fast forward, he tells his parents that and they say oh but we won’t have time for another dinner and lo and behold we have dinner plans today so another fight ensued…

54,1d8ycbd,AITA for asking my partner to come with me to the hospital?,"
I 28 F have been with my partner 27 M almost 2 years now. Today I received a letter informing me that a surgical appointment for injections into both of my hips in July. 
I have been waiting for this appointment for a year and a half because all other treatments have failed and this is a specialist treatment on the NHS with a really long waitlist. As soon as I saw it I went to my partner to let him know that I finally had a date set and that he should book it off to come with me.
He flatly refused telling me that he has no holiday days left and he can't ask for compassionate leave as he had already used his single day allowance after being with me in A&E. I questioned how it is that he has no holiday to book off and he told me he used it all when he first started by telling them he had pre-booked holiday so he could stay at home and play games. He also said that they only gave him that time off because they had to legally due to him ""booking it in"" before he started working there and that otherwise he wouldn't have any holiday at all.

I asked him why he couldn't just ask or take holiday on lieu but he became angry at me because I crossed my arms and told me that I was judging him and that he can't even drive anyway (I won't be able to drive myself as it states in the letter) and that I need to ask a friend because he won't be taking the day off. 

I got frustrated and tried to re-enter our house but he blocked my way with his body and told me that I had no right to be upset and that he had been having a bad time recently too. I told him I wanted to go in the house but he said no because 'I was running away instead of listening to him'.
In the end I went through the door in the open garage but he is still angry at me. I know he can't drive me or anything but I just don't want to be on my own as I go through it all.

Am I the asshole for pushing him to try and get a day off to come to the hospital with me?

55,1d8yb7h,AITA for inviting a girl I just to the team of my (28M) girlfriend (36F) and her husband (41M)?,"So my (28M) girlfriend (36F) and me both climb together and there's this local climbing competition where you have to sign up as a team of four and compete as a team of four. I told my girlfriend about this, that we should participate and she was up for it!

So my girlfriend and me are forming a team, the husband (41M) of my girlfriend is also joining and now we have to find a 4th person.  

Last Saturday I met a girl (let's call her ""C"") at another climbing gym, with whom I climbed with for the first time. I have asked C if she would be up for joining our team. I told my girlfriend about this and she asked why I did that and whether it would be like a date with C. (my side of the relationship with my girlfriend is open, though I don't necessarily seek out a new relationship but I am also not opposed to it)(my girlfriend also has a husband already so that way it's more about keeping some parity) 

I said no it wouldn't be a date, I said I just thought she would fit into the dynamic of our team, personality-wise. Then my girlfriend asked whether I am attracted. I said it's neutral but she is cool to me and I might be open to dating ""C"" at some point. My girlfriend feels hurt, angry and says I'm sleazy because she'd feel insecure to meet someone who might be a potential dating partner for me at some point. She questions my intention. I have to confess that I like the idea of being in a team where my girlfriend and another woman are both into me, but of course I wouldn't invite C or anyone my girlfriend would be uncomfortable with. Considering my girlfriend has a husband and I, her boyfriend, would be there as well, I thought she'd be ok with it. She argues that her husband has always been in the picture since the start of our relationship and that I have always been accepting and supportive of that (which is true).

I have to think a bit for myself as to why I did this, I definitely didn't want to deliberately hurt my girlfriend as I would never do that. But I have been self-reflecting a bit, and I guess I did maybe want to make my girlfriend just a little bit insecure as to keep her on her toes and as to not let her have too much power over me, considering the nature of our relationship. 

Also, my girlfriend was also wanted to invite her male friend to our tea. This male friend has already tried to make a move on her, which my gf has rejected. But my gf still hangs out with this friend and this friend still tries to flirt with her. This is ok in my book as long as my gf doesn't flirt back, which I trust her to not do.

56,1d8y9z7,AITA for forcing my flatmate to move out?,"Two friends lived in my sister's flat. She suggested if it became free my gf and I could move in with a great deal on rent.

1 friend decided to move. I asked the other what his plans were. He said he would relocate or move in with a friend but either way would be moving out.

As time drew closer, there was no sign of him flat hunting. I asked him his plans. He told me he had spoken to my sister and was staying in the flat until at least January. - He couldn't afford to move yet, since the housing market was rough.

I was hurt by his lack of transparency but understood his position. He said he would move in January when he would gets a big pay raise. We moved in in October 

January passed. We put no pressure on him because things were good. He did get the big pay rise.

Then it went downhill. He started spending a lot more time in his room and generally being avoidant. We got frustrated about his lack of chores, being dirty etc. We'd bring things up and he would be dismissive.

Then he told us he was planning to move before the end of summer.

Time passed and we didn't hear about flat hunting. We had a climax with the chords after he said ""it's you're turn to do chores this month or am I wrong?"". I was impressed by the audacity, and was VERY happy to hear that we get months off doing chores. We had a sit down conversation to discuss issues and asked what his living plans were. He said worst case he would stay until December.

A few weeks ago he mentioned going to flat viewings with a friend. One flat they found through this friend, and this friend went to another flat viewing for them. It gave the impression this friend was driving the flat hunt.

We tell him there is a small chance we will be relocating. We hear through the not soundproof doors that he's telling this friend about us potentially moving away, that he can move into our flat. Then their flat hunt runs dry and he continues to be antisocial with us.

My sister lets me know that when my gf and I move out, she wants to sell the flat. For private reasons, it's good for her.

With all the above in mind, we had a sit down conversation with my flatmate. We explain that we want our own space and that we won't live with him until December. We let him know that we know about his plan to move his friend in and that we didn't take his promises of moving out seriously. It seems like he was willing to stay in the flat until we leave and was never serious about moving out.

We tell him there are 2 scenarios for us: relocate, or move into a different flat with our own space. Either way he needs to start looking for a flat since my sister will sell.

He puts on a spectacle, doesn't respond to any points we make and plays the victim. Then he left, saying he was calling his dad for money so he could find a new flat and later sent us a text saying he had given my sister his notice.

A few weeks ago he mentioned going to flat viewings with a friend. One flat they found through this friend, and this friend went to another flat viewing for them. It gave the impression this friend was driving the flat hunt.

We tell him there is a small chance we will be relocating. We hear through the not soundproof doors that he's telling this friend about us potentially moving away, that he can move into our flat. Then their flat hunt runs dry and he continues to be antisocial with us.

My sister lets me know that when my gf and I move out, she wants to sell the flat. For private reasons, it's good for her.

With all the above in mind, we had a sit down conversation with my flatmate. We explain that we want our own space and that we won't live with him until December. We let him know that we know about his plan to move his friend in and that we didn't take his promises of moving out seriously. It seems like he was willing to stay in the flat until we leave and was never serious about moving out.

We tell him there are 2 scenarios for us: relocate, or move into a different flat with our own space. Either way he needs to start looking for a flat since my sister will sell.

He puts on a spectacle, doesn't respond to any points we make and plays the victim. Then he left, saying he was calling his dad for money so he could find a new flat and later sent us a text saying he had given my sister his notice.

So kind people of Reddit, what do you think of all this?",,0.025316806510090828,0,0
57,1d8y0kw,AITA for teasing my friend? I do it often but now she's insanely angry,"*I am not native english speaker, thus i immedietly regret for writting something wrong or bad grammar.*

But now I guess another case, for context, let me tell ye some mandatory information. I could be very obnoxious, by saying last one, I mean I can **cut** many a rude words if someone is pissing me off by being blunt to me. I can say some passive-aggressively rough saying.

So let's get back to the theme, am I the asshole?

61,1d8xvsx,AITA For getting into an argument with my sister over her parenting?,"So, I’m 24M and my sister, 27F who I’ll call April. We live with our parents still and she has 2 children 2F and 5M.

     Our parents have been out of town for two weeks and I understand that without their extra hands taking care of the kids is harder, I am not good with kids, I never have been and I keep to myself most of the time, April never asks me for help with the kids because she knows I would be bad at helping anyway.
     The issue is that they have been screaming and crying daily on and off every single day from ~8 am to when they go to sleep ~9 pm. I work very early mornings and I already have trouble going to sleep most days (I have insomnia I take medication for) and with the kids screaming and noise it’s been making me go to sleep almost a full 2 hours after I should be. This has been making me wake up late so I can’t eat breakfast and I’ve been getting to work late and ending up exhausted my entire shift. 
     We also have a puppy my parents decided it would be cool to leave with us that’s been wrecking the house, I’ve been feeding him and walking him when I can but I frequently can’t because I’ve been so tired and the noise has been causing me migraines (I’m very sensitive to noise, and I can hear them through the noise cancelling headphones I use). So yesterday, they were being particularly bad and she was even yelling back and the dog was barking so I have took him outside on a walk for about an hour but when I got back it was still just screaming and crying and April was sitting on the couch just seemingly over it.
     I put the dog in my parents room and went back downstairs which is when I saw that the backdoor was open, now, I have a cat, he’s an indoor cat but he loves to bolt for the door whenever it’s open, so I admit I panicked and I asked April how long the door had been open and she said she didn’t know. I closed the door and looked around the house for my cat and VERY luckily he was asleep in my room but I was admittedly very very mad. (We live in an area with a BUNCH of predators that could snatch him up in a second)
     I waited until the kids were asleep (had a day off today) and I went downstairs and told her she needs to get the noise under control that it’s ridiculous to have them screaming at all hours and how I’ve been exhausted and I’ve been keeping my mouth shut because I know it’s hard but I do not want to get written up for being late (again) and I especially don’t want my cat to get out and get hurt. She told me I don’t understand being a parent and that she’s doing her best. This is where I might be the asshole because I went off that she chose to have two kids that she is not the only person in this house, her choice is gonna cost me my job possibly and that all I could possibly ask for is for her to just do her job (She is in online school but not working) and give me peace and quiet when I need to go to sleep.
     She responded by calling me a dick and going up to her room to cry. I woke up today with missed calls from my parents and texts essentially saying how dare you and what an awful thing to say and I’m wondering if I should have just kept my mouth shut, she won’t talk to me and the kids have been just as loud today. I do feel a little guilty but also I feel like I have points?

However, after a few gift giving occasions - I can’t help but feel a bit disappointed. 

1. At Christmas (this was really the start/situationship period so I guess I can’t really criticize). I got him some very thought out gifts around his favourite hobby - a board game, socks and a card all following this theme. He bought me a book on sex positions. 

2. For Valentine’s Day, I got him an engraved Swiss Army knife and he got me a board game which I talked about before (this was cute). 

3. For birthdays, I planned with his friends to buy a puzzle together and also got everyone to write in a card. And I handmade his birthday cake which was his favourite type of cake. 
Whilst, he got me a digital picture frame, which is nice but I found out that he got the same one at the same time for his grandma. Killing 2 birds with 1 stone? 

I also want to point out I put a lot of effort into selecting greeting cards, whereas it seems like his are fished out from a drawer of generic cards he has. None are specific to the occasion. 

We generally go 50/50 and he earns a little more than me. We’re both corporate professionals. Though I am aware that because of his upbringing and past, he tends to be very frugal (going for the cheapest items at the grocery store and using shein/aliexpress). For me, it’s not really the price of the items but more of the thought/effort that appears to be involved. Although, it is also clear that I’ve been spending more on gifts for him than vice versa. It’s weird because gifts aren’t even really my main love language, it’s quality time and acts of service. 

All these things have led me to start feeling some resentment which I’m wondering if is valid. So WIBTA if I point out the discrepancy I’m feeling?

64,1d8xr69,AITA for promising my daughter a parakeet in 6 years,"Am I the asshole for promising my daughter a parakeet in 6 years?

My daughter is 9 and a huge animal lover. We have 3 cats but she would love to have more pets. We regularly get requests for a dog, rabbit, guinea pig, etc.

Today, she was playing with a friend and they saw some ducklings swimming. She wanted to know how much it would cost to buy a duck. But I said, we are not getting a duck in the house. Then a piglet was requested, to which I also said no. And I added that when she is older and living on her own, she can decide for herself what animals she wants.

They went back to playing outside and came back an hour later asking if she could have a parakeet in 6 years, when she is 15. I said yes, if you still want a parakeet in 6 years, you can have one.

When my wife came home from work, she was angry about my promise. Firstly, although she is also a big animal lover, she hates birds in the house. I genuinely did not know this.

Secondly, she said I should have discussed it with her before saying yes. That is certainly true and I acknowledged that.

But the worst thing, she thinks, is that you can't promise something like that to a nine-year-old because she doesn't have enough sense of time to realize how long 6 years is. And that she feels very bad for our daughter who will be disappointed when she realizes that 6 years is a very long wait.

Our daughter was already picking out a cage for the parakeet.

So AITA for making this promise?


Update: we spoke to our daughter and explained that I should have talked to my wife first before approving her request. For which I apologized to her. I also explained that we can't promise anything over a span of 6 years.

Today, she was playing with a friend and they saw some ducklings swimming. She wanted to know how much it would cost to buy a duck. But I said, we are not getting a duck in the house. Then a piglet was requested, to which I also said no. And I added that when she is older and living on her own, she can decide for herself what animals she wants.

They went back to playing outside and came back an hour later asking if she could have a parakeet in 6 years, when she is 15. I said yes, if you still want a parakeet in 6 years, you can have one.

When my wife came home from work, she was angry about my promise. Firstly, although she is also a big animal lover, she hates birds in the house. I genuinely did not know this.

Secondly, she said I should have discussed it with her before saying yes. That is certainly true and I acknowledged that.

But the worst thing, she thinks, is that you can't promise something like that to a nine-year-old because she doesn't have enough sense of time to realize how long 6 years is. And that she feels very bad for our daughter who will be disappointed when she realizes that 6 years is a very long wait.

Our daughter was already picking out a cage for the parakeet.

So AITA for making this promise?


Update: we spoke to our daughter and explained that I should have talked to my wife first before approving her request. For which I apologized to her. I also explained that we can't promise anything over a span of 6 years. That for now we don't want anymore pets then we already have, but that this doesn't mean we will never have another pet in the future.",0.0,1.0670123100280762,1,0
65,1d8xogd,AITA for not being able to care for my sisters cat?,"My 2 sisters, late 20s, have basically dumped me (early 30s) with their cat. I’m supposed to kee him for the next year, they say. I know it’ll be longer.

Youngest sister decided to move in with her BF and his mom, cat couldn’t go with, house rules. 

Other sister couldn’t afford their old place so she moved in with a roommate for cheap. Dog was allowed, not the cat.

I live with my dad rent free. Yes, I’m a loser, go for it. I also have 2 cats. 

I knew this wouldn’t work out. I told them in the beginning no, it’s a terrible idea (he met one of my cats previously and tried to kill her, and he’s a massive cat) but they went behind my back regardless and we’re going to drop him off anyways, so to avoid drama I said I’ll try. Not like I had a choice.

It’s been awful. This cat is aggressive, corners my cats and attacks, so they always have to stay separated. All the cats are miserable and my smallest cat is becoming traumatized by the interactions they do have. 

This cat shits almost exclusively on beds. It’s becoming way too much for me, I have my own mental health struggles and I cannot do this anymore. 

I texted them to find alternate arrangements this morning and they called me every name in the book, said some really hurtful things. Said they’ll never speak to me again. Etc. Straight up bullying me and threatening me to keep this cat for the next year. 

I can’t do it. I didn’t want this, I don’t want this. I’m tired and we’re all miserable. But I feel like I have to put my foot down for mine and my cats sake.

I (17 M) have a dilema over a comment made by a classmate, lets call her Lucy (17 F). Lucy and I have always butted heads a bit, but I try my best to not let my emotions get in the way of living life and being kind to people. She's done and said really rude things to my friends and I. I'm not perfect though, so I'm wondering if this skewed my judgement. 

Recently, my family has gone through a bit of a rough time. I have a brother, who I'll call Chris, who's in the same grade as me. Recently, Chris got into a really bad car accident and is still in the hospital. It's been about a month now, and they're suspecting that there may have been other underlying issues that caused the crash. My world has been flipped upside down and I don't know what to think anymore.

The incident takes place about a week or two after the crash. At school, everyone knows that Chris got into an accident and is at the hospital. Lucy, Chris, and I were in one class together and today there happened to be a sub. When she asked who was missing, someone mentioned Chris. Lucy turns to her friend and asks what happened to Chris. I speak up to tell her that he's still in the hospital after his accident. Lucy then says ""oh, he's dead. He crashed his car, he's dead."" 

I was absolutely livid, and so I stood up and just walked out of the classroom. I talked to one of my teachers, who said I should report her, so I did. Later, I found out that another teacher ended up talking with Lucy. She said that she never said such things and was crying, saying she would apologize. He asked if I was sure that I heard what I did because emotions can mess with your head. At the time I told him that even though I was emotional, I knew what I heard. 

Starting to think on it, I don't know if reporting her was the best option. Some of my friends think I'm an asshole and overreacted. I can't think straight and I don't know what to believe anymore.

Initially, I shadowed this postdoc to learn experimental techniques. The project's idea was established by them, involving using a drug on a cell line. The initial experiments failed because we were preparing the drug incorrectly, which killed our cells. Now, I have about 1.5 months to generate reliable data to complete the project.

I feel the supervision I've received has been lacking. When I ask the postdoc about optimizing drug concentrations, they're often unsure. I end up researching the literature and sending it to them, but they don't read it. They only check on my work while I'm conducting experiments and ask about my decisions. Frustrated, I stopped seeking guidance from the postdoc and began planning my own experiments. Suddenly, they started checking on me more frequently.

Today, I confronted the postdoc about the lack of guidance. I expressed my confusion and tight timeline, hoping for extra support due to their experience. They responded that they're also new to the lab and can't be expected to know everything, accusing me of being too pushy. I argued that we need to determine what works and what doesn't, but they insisted that I shouldn't rush and overthink the situation, despite the looming deadline. They claimed I could ask them anything, but their answers are often ""I don't know.""

Additionally, we were supposed to transition our cells from media A to media B, which takes 2-3 weeks. The postdoc promised to handle this transition two weeks ago so I could focus on my project, but they didn't follow through. The lab has now stopped purchasing media A due to cost cuts, forcing us to use cells from other members who had already transitioned to media B. When I asked why they didn't do the transition, they said it didn't matter since other members were doing it anyway.

This is the first time either of us have lived with a significant other and we're both pretty excited about it.  We have different hobbies and I'll admit that he's better about showing interest in my things than I am with his.  

My biggest hobby is dragonflies.  I'm part of a non-profit in our state that works on studying, identifying, education, community outreach, conservation, etc.  Yes, huge nerd stuff I know.  My BF isn't nearly as interested in dragonflies as I am, but he's great about listening about and embracing my enthusiasm for them.  I finally convinced him to come with to one of our community outreach/education events this past weekend.  

These events are mostly geared towards kids and getting them outside and interested in nature.  We give them nets and turn them loose to try and catch dragonflies then help identify them.  This helps us collect data for what kind of species are in different areas.  

I was working the identification booth at this event and told my BF he should grab a net and see if he can catch anything.  He's seen me chasing dragonflies with nets before and always makes jokes about how funny I look trying to catch something that is flying erratically so I kind of wanted to see him try. 

He went out into a prairie with a group and came back maybe 15-minutes later with a dragonfly in his net.  He had the biggest smile on his face and was so proud when he brought it to me to identify it.  Seeing him embrace my hobby like that and enjoy it made my heart so happy.  

But when I looked at the dragonfly to identify it, I was shocked.  It was a very rare species.  So rare in fact that it had never been recorded in our state before.  Ever.  This is a huge deal in the dragonfly community.  It's called getting a state record and it's something that people who study dragonflies their entire lives never achieve.  Getting a state record is one of my biggest goals in dragonfly study and he accomplished it in 15-minutes.  

Obviously, this became the talk of the event and my BF was getting a lot of attention from my colleagues in the non-profit.  Some of them made jokes to me that I should have been bringing my BF to these events a long time ago.  Not going to lie, it made me feel like crap.

On our way home, he was still excited about it and telling me how cool it was.  I tried to be excited for him too and hide how I was really feeling, but he must have picked up on it.  He asked me what was wrong and I kind of snapped at him that he just accomplished something in 15-minutes that is one of my biggest goals and something I will probably never do.  

He got defensive and told me that I'm the one who begged him to come to this event and that I'm being a jerk for making him into a bad guy simply for doing exactly what I asked him to do.

71,1d8wmyq,AITA for announcing my pregnancy?,"Hi all, so a little bit of background my husband and I have been married for a year, and are 14 weeks pregnant. We have been together for 5 years total (currently 28 & 30). 

I have a pretty complex family dynamic, in that I have two older sisters from my dads side, then me - then my parents seperated when I was 9, got back together when I was 21 (an entire drama), in that time my Mom had my little sister, and my Dad a little sister both with previous partners. I in total have 4 sisters ages 36-15. My parents are very happy together, and all my sibilings seem to get on with my parents / there step parents. 

The issues comes, that there is a view from my older sisters that I am my dads favorite (due to being his only child with my mom). My oldest sister has been struggling with infertility for over 5 years, my next oldest sister has never been in a relationship and has previously called both my husband and I 'perverts' as she believes we both 'love sex' while this isn't untrue - I just think she has an odd relationship with it. 

My Dad takes all his children, his partner and his daughters partners on a family weekend every year (he pays). 

I found out I was 13 weeks pregnant (missed the early signs), a week before the trip. My husband and I decided to wait until the trip (a week later) to tell my family, as ALL my immediate family would be there. I was especially excited to tell my Mom. 

In the first night while we sat down for dinner, i basically said 'how would you all feel if there was baby-surname here next year'. My mom got it, and cried, my dad even cried, everyone seemed happy. 

Today on a group text with my two older sisters, they have said it was inconsiderate to my oldest sister, and my other older sister - as it was 'rubbing it in'. In addition, they said it was proving that our Dad cared for me and my Mom more than them. 

Obviously I cannot comment on there relationship with my dad and my Mom, however the actual pregnancy announcement I feel so sad about. I obviously am excited, and hoped they would be to. 

So AITA for announcing my pregnancy to my family at the same time, on a family weekend? 

Edit: Thank you all for comments, for reference my older sisters and I love one another but are not close. My oldest sister is 8 years older than me, the other 6.5 years. My oldest sister specifically was gone by the time I was 10 she was out of state and I saw her 3 times a year. In the past couple I have seen her slightly more, but we don’t have a ‘friend’ relationship. 

I am closer to my other older sister (love her dearly), however as implied by the post above I think she could have her own things happening.

We all get on SO well when we see each other, and I would love to see all of my sisters more - however the family dynamics, combined with distances and my two older sisters loyalties to each other could make that challenging.

If I was to of text my oldest sister before, I would not of trusted people I didn’t know / want to know would know before my own Mom. 

In addition, while I personally suspected infertility when I asked my other older sister, she denied this, and this was not confirmed until after I announced this by my brother in law who told my husband this with upset / irritation.

My oldest sister specifically was gone by the time I was 10 she was out of state and I saw her 3 times a year. In the past couple I have seen her slightly more, but we don’t have a ‘friend’ relationship. 

I am closer to my other older sister (love her dearly), however as implied by the post above I think she could have her own things happening.

We all get on SO well when we see each other, and I would love to see all of my sisters more - however the family dynamics, combined with distances and my two older sisters loyalties to each other could make that challenging.

If I was to of text my oldest sister before, I would not of trusted people I didn’t know / want to know would know before my own Mom. 

In addition, while I personally suspected infertility when I asked my other older sister, she denied this, and this was not confirmed until after I announced this by my brother in law who told my husband this with upset / irritation. ",0.0,0.0061655836179852486,0,1

I feel it’s going to take a toll on me financially to have to pay for her, I will get less work done, and it would be harder to manoeuvre around a new country with them, then I would if I have to on my own. There’s a lot more to worry about, and I’m strictly only going to work on my side hustle.

75,1d8w7i4,AITA for yelling at my mom for cleaning my room?,"I came home today to find my room completely different from when I left. My mom cleaned it while I was working and it was much more organized than when I left. I know any normal person would be glad if their room was cleaned for them, but I have some special circumstances.

She used to verbally and emotionally abuse us as kids. Once a year she would go into our rooms and throw out at least a few trash bags of our belongings. I remember being forced to throw out beloved teddy bears, pokemon cards, and artwork because it was “too much clutter.”

Yes, she was one of the early pioneers of the minimalistic homeschool mothers trend.

Much of these memories are blocked out but sometimes the cleaning would take days as we scrubbed floors and rearranged furniture. And since we were homeschooled, we had nowhere to get away, and often this work would make us skip days of school. I would cry for days on end as she would be screaming at us about how filthy kids we were and this verbal abuse wouldn’t cease until she was satisfied.

I used to get very sick if I was cleaning/dusting without wearing a mask and doing heavy labor due to asthma so I’d be completely emotionally and physically wiped by the end of it. But I’d still have to always thank my mother for helping us clean our rooms and be forced by my father to apologize and tell her how great it looks.

All of this to say I’m traumatized by these experiences. I’m almost 21 now and will be moving out soon. She’s upset and confused that I’d want to leave her, but I can’t stand it anymore.

For the last year or so I’ve told my mom REPEATEDLY that I feel uncomfortable with her in my room and to tell me if she wants it clean to give me a chance to do it first. She’s never listened and says that I should be grateful for all she does.

I feel violated by this. I have autism, ADHD, and according to my psych, potential OCD. My mother knows this. So when she goes into my room and cleans it before I’m mentally prepared for her to do so, I can’t help but breakdown.

I get severe RSD for being judged on my cleanliness and for having my boundaries not respected. And I panic due to not being able to find things, it’s never that messy in my room, and her rearranging my bookshelf and closet and clothes makes me panic due to the lack of consistency that I require. 

If I’m able to clean my room then I can do it in a way that’s friendly to me and my routine… vs being shocked and not knowing where stuff is or if it was thrown out. The flashbacks and autistic meltdowns I get when she does it are intense and hard to deal with.

She likely did it today to be nice but I’ve told her to stop and to ask me to clean it first, and if I don’t then she can do whatever she likes. I’ve been visibly distraught each time she’s done it. Today I yelled at her, called her a b*tch, and forced her out of my room as she was spilling water on my photos. I feel this is a violating me, my privacy, and my boundaries.

76,1d8vxpa,AITA for having my boyfriend sign a written document that he owes me after not paying me back for a year?,"A year ago now, I (22f) paid for a few things for my boyfriend (35m) that he was supposed to pay me back for but couldn’t afford to at the time. He figured he would win a settlement later in the year and that he would have the funds to pay me back so didn’t look into finding a job (I know). We didn’t initially get this in writing like I should have, but with how whenever I would bring it up he wouldn’t address it, or most recently how he said “but we’re in a relationship”, as well as the amount of time that has passed, I felt it was necessary to finally get it on paper. He also already has large legal debts (at least $10,000) and while in active addiction had wasted $300,000 he had won (he is now in recovery), so I know he isn’t very financially responsible so it had been a growing concern as time passed that I wouldn’t be paid back, especially with how many close calls to breaking up we have had.

This is only for an amount of $350, but I was raised to be responsible with money. The only caveat is that my codependency gets in the way and I give and trust too much, so initially I assumed this wouldn’t be an issue. Both of my parents have passed away, and my dad was successful, so I have money coming my way when I’m older and am not in a hunch for money currently. But - I don’t think that is an excuse to not be paid back. No matter the amount of assets either person has it doesn’t excuse the need to pay someone back. And being in a relationship doesn’t excuse this either. 

When I told him I’d like for him to sign this, he immediately got angry and said that I have all of the money in the world and that I’m bringing in a legal matter that puts pressure on the relationship, stating that this is like “what the rich does to the poor”. I understand how doing this is perceived as an insult to him, and potentially questions the integrity of the relationship yet I’ve tried to explain that it’s been a year with no serious discussion, that I’m doing this to relieve my own anxiety, that he already has other debts to pay, that how often we almost break up adds to the worry, and that doing this will help relieve any building resentment. I don’t hold the value of money over relationships, but I want him to be accountable and I don’t need to worry about it for over a year, questioning if he will follow through.

He did immediately sign it but we are yet again on the verge of seriously breaking up. So am I the asshole for asking him to sign a document a year after owing me? I feel like this is the smart and financially responsible thing to do at this point, although not ideal overall, while I can see where he’s coming from about this damaging the integrity of our relationship as it shows I lack the trust in him for him to pay me back.

81,1d8vewp,AITA for telling a secret to a friend but not saying it to my best friend?,"Hi, just need to get my mind clear on this. Basically, we're all in high school and I have a crush on a guy who's like a grade below me. And I've only told 1 person, a girl who's in the year ABOVE me, let's call her Maja. 

For some context, I have this other friend (Michelle, f) and she's kind of my best friend. She says that I'm her best friend and if she's got big news she normally shares it to me first. She's had some issues with friendships in the past so I mean quite a lot to her. I'd consider her a good friend too but she's done several things in the past before to me so I don't think of her as highly as she thinks of me. She is in my grade.

Now to the main problem. I've asked a bunch of people in the friend group what they think about a year age gap (with no context on any crushes or whatever) and they've responded quite negatively to it. Even Michelle herself has kinda joked that it would a bit strange to date someone younger or older.

So, I've only told Maja about my crush because she's a year above me, so she can't tell anyone about my crush even if she wanted to because she doesn't know anyone from my grade to tell. She also has had a crush on a guy a with a 1-year age gap so she supports me. Mainly, I told her my secret because she was pretty much gonna find out anyways (we go to the same club where my crush is) and she wasn't gonna have much of an impact in my social life, because she knows no one in my grade.

So recently some people in the group have gotten really interested in my crush and they've started to ask who it is, especially Michelle. During one of these conversations, I accidentally dropped the fact that only 1 person knows and I told her that I really couldn't tell anyone because you might spill the secret, even by accident.

So she got quite upset and she just left and she hasn't spoken to me in a few hours and now I kinda feel like the AH because I told 1 person but not Michelle, who trusts me the most. But on the other hand I feel like I was kind of justified to not tell her something because of her links to the social circle.

I had dragged out breaking up with her for like a week because we’re part of the same friend group and I didn’t want to split the group up. Essentially I broke up with her bc of a lack of common interests + she refused to tell her parents abt us (her sister is gay and her parents accept her, every time I brought up her coming out she would just shake her head and not provide a reason which was another thing that bothered me). Before breaking up with her, which i did over text which i now realize wasn’t the best idea, i spoke with her best friend (18m) who told me she was planning on breaking up with me the following morning anyway. 

When i told her I wanted to break up with her, she told me she was okay with it and had been thinking the same things, even telling some other mutual friends she was planning on breaking up. This leads into the actual issue. The next week, a mutual friend texted me and told me it “wasn’t a great idea” for me to continue to sit at our shared lab table in AP chem, which i share with my now ex girlfriend and a few other friends.

For example- when they became serious- she told us that she was moving in within a weeks time. A day after the news, we asked what would happen with her 16 year old daughter who still resided in her home and in a a different school district. She said- I just renewed the lease on our apartment so she can finish out her senior year. After that- she never moved in. These are the types of white lies that have been frequent in nature over the course of 2 years. In Feb of this year, my BIL split (one of many breakup instances) with this woman and it was a very nasty breakup. The week after they ended their relationship, she reached out to a family member and told them ""my father lost his battle with cancer"". We assumed that meant he had passed away and some family sent direct condolences- which were met with hostile responses. Due to her response, I decided not to reach out to her to express condolences, but rather find the obituary and send condolences / donations if included in the obit info. I couldn't find anything.

My sister lives in another city about a day's drive away. Close enough to come back for holidays but far enough a car with an iffy engine could leave her stranded in the middle of nowhere, potentially without cell signal or help. 

Her car broke down last year around Thanksgiving or Christmas and she got it repaired but was warned it was old enough to limit it to city driving. Meaning no coming home. 

So the whole family banded together for a down payment. Mom, Dad, Nana, Grandma all gave her what they could afford but used cars have gotten *expensive* she was short a few thousand. 

I had been saving up for something specific. The money was available but it was *earmarked* and not for a fun thing like a vacation (not that I need to defend how I use my own money).

She needed 3k. Promised to pay back the first 1.5k by mid Feb at the latest and ""make payments"" on the rest. 

She did pay back the 1.5k by mid Feb. 

But there seems to be a miscommunication about what payments meant. I assumed it meant monthly payments and worked that into the budget that the 3k was supposed to cover. She assumed it meant... I didn't know.

So I asked. 

And she got very angry. Told me assumptions don't make a contract, which is *fair*. That's why I was trying to see what she thought it meant so I would know if it was reasonable and if it was we could go with that! I just wanted to know what to *actually* expect. 

After trying to convince me she had two years to pay it back (we had talked about that at one point but when she actually asked to borrow the money she asked for one year). She blamed me for taking half her school money (the 1.5k was school money... but she got a car?!). She eventually told me she planned to give me chunks out of her next two semesters of school money. 

Good. Done. All I needed. 

And I would have left it at that but she's refused to talk to me text me, even going so far as to make my mom miserable when she came to to town. 

So am I the asshole for 1) interpreting ""payments"" as monthly payments. And 2) when I was insisting on knowing what it meant instead.

My (25F) sister (35F) just had her second baby a few weeks ago. So she has a 22 month old and a 2 week old. 

Her husband is in the navy, and in July, he will be away for a whole month. Obviously this is less than ideal since at that point the baby will only be about 1.5 months old. 

Now my sister is looking to have people come stay with her just to help out while her husband is away so she’s not left alone with 2 kids under 2.

So really she’s just looking for someone to wake up and get the 22 month old ready for daycare, drive her to daycare, and pick her up at the end of the day. While my sister takes care of the baby. 

My mom is planning to go for 2 weeks to help my sister, and then my sisters mother in law will also do 1 week. 

My mom has asked / assumed that I would be willing to go stay with my sister for the remaining week and help out. When I expressed some hesitation my mom seemed pretty put out and like I was sort of leaving my sister hanging.

 
I have a few reasons why I don’t really want to help:
- my sister lives 3 hours away (which includes a ferry ride) 
- me and my partner share a car so I will have to transit and walk on the ferry, or leave my partner without a vehicle
- I work full time from home, so it is easy for me to work from anywhere, but I think it will be hard to focus if the newborn is crying all the time 
- knowing my sister, it will end up being more than just taking my niece to and from daycare, she would probably ask me to help with stuff during the day or make dinner etc
- I like spending time with kids in small doses, but I find being around them a lot really anxiety inducing, especially my 22 month old niece because she is very reckless and on the go non stop so you constantly have to watch her

This last bit makes me feel a bit like an AH but my sister and her husband have said they want to have lots of kids, like 5, and given that my sister is already 35 they will all be close in age. I sort of have the mindset of if my sister can’t even take care of 2 kids by herself, how is she going to deal with 5? I know having a newborn is an insane amount of work (my other sister also has 2 kids so I’ve seen them both being raised), but I feel like it’s your choice to have lots of kids so you should be able to take care of them? I’m not even sure I want kids myself. 

TLDR: WIBTA for not helping my sister out with her kids for a week because I don’t want to / it’s inconvenient for me

Edit to add some context:

- my sister is not a full time SAHM, but she is on maternity leave and will be for 1 year. She was on maternity leave until July 2023 with her first, returned to work for about 7 months, and then went off again when she had her second
- her and her husband did not know he would be going away in July before she got pregnant
- keeping 22 month old home from daycare would likely be more work because she is just so high energy
- I wouldn't be commuting back and forth, I would go and stay with her for an entire week
- my mom and sisters MIL are both retired so they aren't having to take time off work to help
- I see some people saying that 'wouldn't you expect your sister to do the same for you' and I don't think I would, because by the time I have kids (if at all), she will have 2 or more of her own and I wouldn't expect her to travel 3 hours with all of them to come and stay with me. Not that I expect something in return for helping out family, I'm just saying since I'm the youngest sibling I won't have a younger child free sibling to help me out if/when I have kids
- my mom is more the problem here, when my sister and her husband mentioned it to me they were more like 'if you want, no pressure' etc. but my mom is the one making me feel guilty for not wanting to
- I would obviously never say to my sisters face that she should be able to handle her own kids
- me and my other sister are already planning to go over sometime this month while husband is still home just for a visit over a weekend to meet the baby since we haven't yet, so this trip in July would be an additional one",Not the A-hole,2024-06-05,"WIBTA for refusing to help babysit for my sister? 
My (25F) sister (35F) just had her second baby a few weeks ago. So she has a 22 month old and a 2 week old. 

Her husband is in the navy, and in July, he will be away for a whole month. Obviously this is less than ideal since at that point the baby will only be about 1.5 months old. 

Now my sister is looking to have people come stay with her just to help out while her husband is away so she’s not left alone with 2 kids under 2.

For context: her grandma passed two months ago, her she just got dumped by her abus1ve bf of a year right before Christmas, and we’ve planned this for 6 months. 
We brought me and my bf (19m) who she has also been friends with and who SHE insisted on bringing for “our safety”. 
The whole trip (this is day 6/8) has been pretty swimmingly as long as she’s getting 1000% what she wants. 
We went to a mall and walked around a store for me and it made my shoes hurt my feet, so at the next store I looked for sandals in hopes to quickly fix my issue. She got upset she got left alone. We walked to the next place we all were supposed to go and she told me and my boyfriend she feels alone and like a loser seeing everyone around us have a friend/partner to cuddle or hug.

I have been doing all/if not most of the clean up packing and unpacking. We went to the beach for a whole day and I was so nauseous the whole day. 
I held my pee a two hour drive (not her fault I held it.) and then we got ready for dinner. We get to the dinner and she couldn’t go in because we were under 21. That made her cry.

It’s the minute something goes not according to plan.
 She has known us for years and we are naturally very low energy people. We do our very best to get hype and excited but low energy people can’t do it 8 days straight morning to night. I’m exhausted and she feels shotty that everyone is “too tired”z

recently, we’ve been hanging out a lot with two women who went to high school with him, who have now become my friends, sort of. 
me and these girls have a lot in common, but we only went out once without K. it was nice but i would say they’re my close friends. 
i notice that K tries to make jokes to them all the time that we’re together and doesn’t include me in them. i also see that they will laugh quite loudly at them, even when i don’t find what he said funny. 
what bothers me the most is that when K makes the jokes, he turns his body to them and will keep looking them as they laugh just to see their reaction i suppose? without ever looking at me. 
a few weeks ago i made a joke to K about how he has to stop making so many jokes around them and he gave off this “fake defensive” vibe and said he was never making jokes again. 
i haven’t talked about it since but i also now feel a bit uncomfy hanging out all four of us, especially because when i said something funny or make a comment about anything, the two women treat me so “distantly,” they laugh at i said just to make me feel good, idk… it feels weird.
now every time we plan on doing something with them i have this feeling that it’s going to be a chore. that i’m going to have to power through it because i find myself not knowing what to do or to say when i’m there. it’s ridiculous honestly, but i want to hear some unbiased opinions.

I created a FB messenger group last year for my parents and I to share holiday photos as my father doesn’t have a smart phone/WhatsApp and I really wanted him to see all the beautiful, natural wonders we have come across on our travels. 

I named the group (translated from my mother tongue) “Little Family Chat” - and may have shared 20 holiday photos in total. 

My mum, sister and I also have a WhatsApp group going between us and I shared those pictures there as well so sis can see them too. 


Yesterday my sister was at my parents’ house, to help dad with his FB messenger issues on his laptop and seen the group. Asked who’s in it, my dad said something like “we’ll all of us I think”.
It’s important to note that this group was not in use for well over a year and literally only used it to share those photos. 

My sister is now not talking to any of us, guessing as she felt excluded, despite the same photos being sent to the WhatsApp group. She didn’t look in the contents of the chat.

This sounds so childish, esp as she’s 36 and I’m 41 but honestly, am I the asshole in this scenario?

There’s a long history of her creating drama over small things but she really managed to push my buttons with this one and today I told her straightup that I’ve had it with her frolics and I’m no longer interested in speaking with her, which I now regret…but I wish she wouldn’t be so quick to play the victim and be more open to hear us out before giving us all the soap opera treatment 😞

I have never liked my husband's family (most of them anyways) because they have a lot of old fashioned opinions and don't really approve of me. We don't have a lot of contact so it's okay though. 

  
My husband's cousin's wedding is this week and they are getting married in our city, so he offered for his parents and aunt and uncle to stay with us. (bride and groom are renting a place.) It is a bit of squeeze but it is working.

While they were in the living room and I was in the kitchen and they knew I could hear. 

  
I was stewing but I don't really like confrontation so I didn't say anything. Later I asked my husband if he could please tell them to shut up with the snide comments about me. He said that's just their opinion and it's not really hurting me, if I'm bothered I should learn to stick up for myself - and that he can't always do it for me. This sort of struck a nerve because it's true that I usually ask him to do small things like telling the drive-thru person if our order is wrong, because it just makes me feel weird and guilty. But somehow it feels like more his responsibility because it's his family involved here? 

  
Anyways so today my FIL made one more pointed comment during dinner and I said your son makes xxx. We live in a big city and rent is xxx.

He said that's just their opinion and it's not really hurting me, if I'm bothered I should learn to stick up for myself - and that he can't always do it for me. This sort of struck a nerve because it's true that I usually ask him to do small things like telling the drive-thru person if our order is wrong, because it just makes me feel weird and guilty. But somehow it feels like more his responsibility because it's his family involved here? 

  
Anyways so today my FIL made one more pointed comment during dinner and I said your son makes xxx. We live in a big city and rent is xxx. We literally cannot live on his salary so I don't know why you think I should be home all day. They were pretty quiet after that. Now my husband is really angry with me because I put him down in front of his family who are all richer than us and will look down on him. AITA? ",0.0,1.043865442276001,1,0
96,1d8s063,AITA for being a sponger with my grandmother?,"To begin with, my sister (F12) and I (F19) have lived with my grandmother (F65) since I was born. I didn't have a father present and my mother left home when I was around 11 years old. Because we don't have a good financial situation and we live in a Latin country, it's difficult to leave home so soon.

My grandmother had to leave the countryside early and started working from a very early age, around 12 years old with a family that forbade her to continue her studies and forced her to stay locked in their house to work as a full-time maid and nanny. Her life has basically stopped since then, and she has been focused on prioritizing the well-being of other people.

And that's where the problem starts.

My grandmother was always very worried, to the point of fighting me for trying to leave the house to go to therapy alone (I was already 18 at the time) or locking me in the house and leaving with all the keys so I couldn't leave. . Her overprotection was something that delayed and continues to significantly delay my life. I want to go to university and we've already fought about this subject because she thinks it's too dangerous, I want to go out and get a job but I can't because she thinks the world is too dangerous and is afraid that I won't come home again, but lately something has bothered me in private and she always finds some kind of excuse for it.

Here at home I've never had to wash dishes if I didn't want to, my grandmother never taught me anything and if I try to do it, she makes a fuss and takes the cleaning materials out of my hand because I'm not doing it the ""right way"", but So I ask her to explain to me what way she wants and she says she has no obligation to explain it to me because she never needed anyone to teach her anything.

But then she needs to tidy up everything in the house alone and says that my sister and I are lazy and we take advantage of her, I retort saying that she should demand that we have our activities in the house to help in a way that she doesn't feel uncomfortable and she tells me go to hell, stating that she would never ask anyone for anything because it was humiliating. She treats my sister and me like two complete idiots, in addition to often acting like a child who has been challenged when we try to talk.

AITA for not imposing more on me or am I lacking some effort? Because let's face it, it's ridiculous to see that I'm an adult woman and I'm completely incompetent, I don't even consider myself a functional human being because I'm passive in everything, because I don't need to have responsibilities or care that someone my age already has.

97,1d8rgwl,AITA for refusing to allow one of my wife's best friends on her surprise 30th birthday weekend away?,"Hi everyone!

My wife is 30 years old in October this year and I set up a WhatsApp group and invited 7 of our friends in to arrange a couple of nights away as a surprise.

As many in the group are struggling for money, I've tried to keep it as cheap as possible. Most places I found online were too expensive, however I found a suitable place in both facilities and price and booked it. The only negative I suppose is that it isn't far away at all - but we just intend to stay at the accomodation and use the hot tub they have and the decent sized table to play games. 

Everyone, bar one, is happy to pay. Even though it is close by, it is still a weekend free of kids and has a hot tub - something none of us have. This one friend though, wants to get a taxi to and from on the first night then drive the second.

Now, AITA for saying no? The rest of us have paid x amount for the use of the facilities and use of the house, but she wants to get it for free basically, and justify it by not stay over. I said in the group that I can't have that, it's not fair on the rest of us. She asked if I was being serious and I said I was. She flipped, said it's not fair and that she would do something separate and quit the group.

She's then messaged me reiterating how unfair I've been and that I've singled her out infront of everyone. She says she can't afford it and that my wife will want her to be there. Now I've got it on good advice that she has thousands in savings and far more disposable income than anyone else in the group, so her saying she can't afford it is utter garbage to me. She says I've made her upset, feel like crap and she's been crying about it.

Now AITA for firstly telling her she can't come based on the above, then also sticking to my guns about it?

What's more, I play fortnite with her and my wife on a team, and this is going to mess things about. I think it's going to make it very hard to keep it a surprise to my wife going forward.

99,1d8q3ik,AITA for not letting my husband sleep more?,"For context, I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my husband, his 11 yr old daughter, and our 2 yr old son. My stepdaughter has her own room, and my husband, son, and myself share the primary bedroom. My son sleeps in his own bed. 

For the care of our son, my husband and I alternate time-of-day care. For instance, I always do bath and bedtime, while my husband does wake ups 90% of the time. Also, I am the breadwinner, and my husband is a stay-at-home-dad.

Now, to the issue. Last night, I did bedtime as normal. My husband was playing video games with a friend. That's normal. He deserves a break after caring for our son all day. I took a shower and ended up in bed around midnight. 

Well, my husband decided to stay up later than me. I'm not sure why. Usually, when he stays up later, it's because he's playing a game. He will pass out in his chair and wake up sometime in the middle of the night. When this happens, he typically chooses to sleep on the couch instead of risking waking us up. 

Last night, I woke in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep. At about 4am, I could hear my husband snoring away from the couch. I tried, in vain, to get back to sleep. 

At 6:30am, my son started to stir, and by 7, he was ready to get out of his crib. My husband is usually awake by then, and usually comes in to get him up. He didn't. So I got our son up and cuddled him and sent him to find his father while I laid back down. 

Here's where I may be the asshole: my husband then comes in the bedroom and asks for another hour of sleep. I did not react well as I, myself, did not sleep well, and I have a full day of work ahead of me. I told him that I'd gotten less than 4 hours of sleep myself, and that I needed rest for work. My tone was definitely whiny bordering on accusatory. Every other time he's asked for extra sleep, I have obliged. I just didn't have it in me this morning to listen to him snore from the bedroom while I struggle to care for a toddler, attend work meetings, and get work done on less than 4 hours of sleep. 

He said ""Nevermind"" in a derisive tone and stomped off. I couldn't get back to sleep, so I just got up and started working (It's one of my remote work days.) 

Now, he's sulking and doing tasks around the apartment in a rough manner, complaining under his breath, and generally avoiding talking to me.

102,1d8p65u,AITA for canceling plans with my boyfriend after he didn't confirm for 4 hours.,"Me(30m) and my boyfriend(30m) have been in a real strained place for the last few months. Alot of petty arguments and just insensitive behavior. We've spoken almost every day but we haven't actually seen each other in probably over a month.

I complained to him about always making plans and that I wanted him to make more of an effort to initiate plans. Unfortunately the day he spontaneously decided to make a plan, I took an extra shift at work and he got mad that I wasn't readily available. He said he would never do it again. This felt unreasonable to me, but a friend said that he was valid in his anger since I was the one that was complaining initially and didn't follow through. I didn't agree as the plans were out of the blue and I accepted the shift before I even knew about them but I digress..

I decided to make plans to meet up. I was shot down as he said he was working/busy but he never offered an alternate. So I said I was try to plan something for a different day. I told him to be free for Wednesday to hang out. He said it would depend on what we were doing. This pissed me off a bit because to me it shouldn't really matter. Were you going to not see me because I didn't plan something to your liking? Anyway I messaged him that it would be lunch and movie (even threw in a surprise spa session) he said ""okay, that's fine""..

So the day before I called to confirm we were still good to go. I called him multiple times and when he answered you could hear that he was drinking. It was like 5:30 on Tuesday! He rushed me off the phone as he was with his friends.

I message him ""if we were still good for tomorrow? Should we reschedule?"" I don't want to go with him anywhere if he has a hang over and he has a habit of drinking to excess. I never got answer. I messaged him every hour if he was okay. I called him 3 hours later, 3 times, and on the third time he finally answers sounding annoyed. I asked him what his problem was? He said he never had his phone with him. 

I asked again if we were good for tomorrow and his response was ""what's happening tomorrow?"" I was mad and said forget the whole thing and that if hanging out wasn't important to him that I wasn't going to press the subject.

However, he continued following me around and when my dog raised his legs to pee on a tree, the old uncle came over and tried to chase us away. I got angry and confronted him. He then said ""no peeing"".

104,1d8ojre,AITA for rejecting my friend’s invite to lunch even though she offered to pay?,"I (F30) am currently studying a PhD. This means that even though I get paid through a scholarship and through several small projects that I am working on, I am under a student budget.
I have a colleague (F35ish) that is always asking everyone in our program to go out. So far, during May and June she has invited us to 3 lunches, the theatre and a museum expo. These outings are usually on weekdays and at quite expensive places. She makes the invite weeks in advance and reaches out via WhatsApp, mail and asks in person.

I have rejected all invites except for one lunch. I try to be very mindful with my budget and I try to be very strict with my schedule during weekdays because given that no one is supervising how much I advance with my research, it’s easy to postpone it and not move on with my stuff.  Also, during the weekends I try to spend time with my husband, and given that I see my colleagues all day during the week, I don’t want to spend a lot of extra time with them during the weekend. So the reason why I reject my colleague’s invite is due to (1) money (2) time (3) other priorities.
This colleague recently invited me and a group of friends to another lunch a very fancy restaurant. I told her that in can’t attend because I’m minding my budget and thanked her for the invite. She then told me not to worry, that she can pay for my bill so I can go.

This is where I might be TA. I told her that I don’t feel comfortable having a friend pay for my lunch at such a fancy and costly place. I thanked her again but said I can’t make it to the lunch. She told me that she feels rejected  because every time she makes plans with the group I say no. I pointed out that I am already going to one lunch this month, and said that I’m happy to chat over lunch at the kitchen in our workplace any day (I meal prep so I bring my food), but that going out that often is not an option for me. She pointed out at how I sometimes buy coffee instead of using the coffee maker in the centre, so I’m not really saving money and therefore it must be that I don’t want to spend time with her. I said that I sometimes get tired of having the same coffee and I get specialty coffees, and that I don’t need to give any explanations about why I decide to spend money on coffee and not lunch.

She didn’t say anything else but I could tell that she was very angry. My husband said that I should just go since she would be paying, so now I’m doubting if I’m exaggerating. AITA?

Now she goes ballistic at this, constantly messaging me and calling. Shouting at me to get off, to a point that I make the excuse my WiFi had failed, and I went off, which means I lost all the progress on the mission.

Ever since we have been arguing, she is saying she doesn't want me to come to a festival we had planned this weekend, and is also I don't care about her and her feelings. I got called selfish, an asshole and alot more in this too.

My husband who is Muslim, is not used to the heavy pork diet for postpartum recovery and breastfeeding. He made several comments and sometimes pretend to throw up when he smells my mother cooking it.

Yesterday evening while I was feeding our child, he kept saying there was a weird smell. He sniff both me and our son, then made a scoffing sound when he smelled me. He said I had a slight BO, which he quickly concluded was because I eat a heavy pork diet nowadays. I know he didn’t like it when I eat pork and had always made comments, but this was beyond hurtful to assume my BO was from my diet. I had the same diet before we married, but it never bothered him. 

Today, he told me again in confession that he has been smelling BO on me and that my mother carried the same smell. He again concludes that it is because we eat too much pork. At this point, I am very hurt. I already struggled with my postpartum body, being 30lb over my pre-pregnancy weight and now my beloved husband is constantly telling me I smell terrible. Sensing how upset I was, he did some googling on his own and found out that my BO was most likely due to my postpartum. Apparently postpartum BO and sweat is super common, especially for breastfeeding mother like myself. He then proceeded to tell me I can continue my pork diet since it’s probably not the cause of my BO.

I confronted him about how I felt hurt by his comments. I told him that being postpartum and breastfeeding hasn’t been easy for me. I told him about my struggle with my bodily image and the sacrifices I have to make to breastfeed our child (diet restriction and being tied to a pump).

He said this problem is only temporarily while I am breastfeeding and that it can be resolved so long I keep up with my hygiene, use antiperspirants, or perfume.

This is where I might be the bad guy. She asked me when I had become someone she can’t recognize and I asked her “when you became a bitch and didn’t realize how you treat me.” She became quiet, said “really?” And when I said yes she left the room. 

Ever since then, she only speaks to me to let me know something important and never says I love you anymore. This may not seem like much but my family always says “I love you sweet dreams” before bed it’s just habit. I’ve felt so bad with her for so long, I just let it out that night and now I feel guilty and I don’t know why. Is it because I wanted her to apologize? To ask me to elaborate so we could talk it out? I don’t know.

Or is it more simple, AITA? ",0.0,0.01088172197341919,0,1
111,1d8ne95,AITA for not attending my coworkers remarry event after she flirted with me?,"im a 27 year old black male that works security night shifts at a hotel. I had been working at this company for about 2 years  but we recently had a employee transfer to the sales department. Let's call this person Jenny. Jenny is Hispanic and in her early 30s with 4 kids and a husband. 

Me and Jenny got close and often talked about our experiences with the job and life in general.  In fact we got TOO close. Jenny was nice at first but became very flirty with me quickly. She made it very obvious that she wanted to sleep with me and even went as far as showing me her breasts from her phone and telling me stories about her having group sessions. she said she never had a black guy before. I had second thoughts about sleeping with my coworker, especially a married one with kids. In fact I hadn't slept with anyone in a while. Something seemed off about the situation but Jenny was persistent. 

One day Jenny had a fight with her husband and told me he left to stay with a cousin. I felt bad and decided to hang out with Jenny outside of work. I told her we could hang out on Tuesday since I knew we were both off that day. When it came Tuesday, Jenny did not respond to me. 
 
Jenny and her husband made up and were even getting remarried. I didn't even know that was a thing. Suprisingly Jenny asked me and other coworkers to attend the remarrying event. I've never been to a wedding but I know people put a lot of effort into them so I told Jenny I'd think about it. I put some thought into it and felt it would be very awkward if I went to the event. Jenny texted me and was saying she was excited about me meeting her family at the event. I texted back "" i never said I was going'. 

From that day on, Jenny was distant from me and often made excuses to not talk to me . AITA for refusing to go to Jenny's remarry event or was i right to follow my gut feeling?

112,1d8n99h,AITA Erasing my Macbook after someone else used it for 4 years ,"Hello Reddit,

This is my first post,

Back in 2020, I was 17 and had just moved by myself from the UK to Australia. I bought a new MacBook Air for school, but then COVID hit. Everything changed, and suddenly I had a plane ticket to New Zealand and two days to sell everything and leave. I listed my laptop at a good price, and someone came to buy it that evening. The buyer was in his mid-20s and seemed nice. He showed me a bank transfer, and I saw the money in my account. We said our goodbyes, and I thought that was it.

A few hours later, a mark appeared next to the transfer, and within a few days, the money and the transaction disappeared. I still don’t fully understand what happened, but I was told it was an uncleared funds issue, and the bank couldn’t do anything. I was devastated as it was a significant amount of money for me, and I didn’t make it to New Zealand.

A few months later, I needed a new phone and got a great deal on a second-hand iPhone X. To my surprise, there were messages from someone in Singapore. The guy said he bought my laptop from an online store and wanted the password to my Apple account to use the device properly. I explained the situation and asked him to return the stolen laptop, which he refused. He claimed the MacBook model was rare in Singapore and insisted I give him the password. Frustrated, I told him if someone steals your car and asks for the keys, you don’t just hand them over. I ended up selling the iPhone X for a profit and went back to Android.

About a year later, I got another MacBook and started exploring its settings. When I opened the Find My iPhone app, I was shocked to see my stolen laptop listed with the guy’s name and location. I felt anxious about my data and messaged him again. His response was the same – he wouldn’t return it. After two years, I couldn’t really blame him. I removed the device from my list, thinking that was the end of it.

Fast forward to today (four years later) , and I checked Find My again. The laptop was back! I had enough and researched how to permanently remove it. I learned that if you remove a device while it’s offline, it comes back when it’s online. To permanently remove it, you need to erase the device and then remove it. Erasing an Apple device deletes all data, settings, and information. Essentially remotely bombing the laptop and factory reseting it . <-- Edit: I went ahead with this

On one hand, my laptop was stolen, and the guy refused to return it even though he could’ve gotten a refund and he still has a fully function laptop, that he can now use without any of the restrictions he had . On the other hand, nothing bad happened over the last four years, and he probably had a lot of personal and work stuff on it. I feel bad for him, but I was also stressed about my data being exposed to a stranger. As you can tell im not a big apple person and i made mistakes along the way.

What do you think? Did I act like an asshole in this situation?

Extra Clarification : I erased the laptop before posting this.  Also I have removed it from my Apple ID so that I can no longer track it. The laptop now should be the same as if it had never had an account it. 

From some of the comments that have suggested I brick the device, I did decided not to. The loss of the laptop was along time ago. I’ve moved on and honestly it’s not worth the headache to try and get it returned at this point, especially considering that it’s a minor crime that is probably to late for the police to care, also it’s not worth that much now days, maybe a 300-400$. In my mind, making sure that all my data was safe and that there is no account linked was enough. It does not bother me that the guy still gets to use the laptop. I’m mostly just happy I don’t need to worry anymore.
Also thank you for all the comments ! ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-05,"AITA Erasing my Macbook after someone else used it for 4 years  Hello Reddit,

114,1d8mrqj,AITA - Dads Birthday Dilemma,"My dad is turning 60 this year. Initially he told me to save the date for 2 night getaway with other family members in December which I agreed to and that has been booked.

Earlier this year he claims that he
 told me to save the date for a combined SECOND celebration (with his partner) in mid January which also happens to be my birthday weekend. I don’t remember this conversation. When he reminded me of the date and we had a disagreement where he kinda manipulated me into feeling bad by saying they only booked it because I agreed to the date (even though it’s my own birthday weekend). My partner who was also apparently there when they told us also doesn’t remember. 

Now my partner and I would like to go overseas for two weeks in January and due to prices / her leave schedule it will clash with the birthday. 

I know my dad will be upset if I don’t go. Not sure what to do because I would personally prefer to go overseas considering we are already attending a birthday getaway for him in December which is when his actual bday is. AITA IF I DONT GO?

115,1d8mngm,AITA for not going to my boyfriends sisters celebration week? ,"So my birthday is today and it’s the middle of the night right now I’ve been trying to pack and get everything together and get my dogs stuff all packed for this 8 hour road trip to my boyfriends hometown but I just broke down and gave up and I lost all interest in going. It’s my birthday today and the thought of having to do this drive on my birthday sucks just to get there and have to go straight to bed because there is no plans for my birthday. I wanted to go on a trip with my boyfriend for my birthday and I thought that’s what we where going to do but he stop discussing it with me and he decided he wanted to visit his sister and mom for his sister birthday. His sisters birthday is the day before mine. We both had work yesterday so the soonest we can leave is on my actual birthday.we are supposed to be there for 4 days and she wanted to go wine tasting. He also said on the phone that he was going to take her to whatever restaurant she wanted for her birthday. Mind you we are supposed to arrive on my birthday I asked if we had any plans that night and my boyfriend said we didn’t have any. So basically his sister is going to have 4 days of us being there celebrating her birthday. The wine tasting thing I guess what supposed to be part of the combined celebration but to me it’s just for her I’m just there to support my boyfriend and to bond with his family. I don’t know I’m thinking of just pretending to be sick and let my boyfriend go to his hometown to celebrate his sister while I make a plan to grab dinner with one of my girlfriends. I’m just kind of sad that his sister didn’t plan this the weekend before my birthday but instead the weekend that’s closer to my birthday and calling my boyfriend expecting him to show up. Last time I was there she made a rude remark about me not being the prize I ended up crying to my boyfriend this was the first time I meet his whole family and she ended up apologizing. She can be rude and super straightforward but I do like her as a person. I just think I’m going to be sad seeing how much attention and celebration her birthday will have and I’ll just be feeling like a guest when it’s in fact closer to my birthday at this point. 


Edit: after talking to him this morning, he is saying the entire thing is supposed to be a jointed birthday, but he already told me that he’s planning on having a dinner with his sister just the two of them because they haven’t seen each other in a while and I told him that I felt like the tasting and the dinner is just for her, but he’s trying to say that the wine tasting is for both of us and he’s gonna take me to dinner with her as a joined birthday dinner while we are there. Or that we will do 2 different one on ones with him. It was all her idea to go wine tasting I not really a big drinker. Even though he’s trying to say this is for both of us I still feel like the trip is mainly for his sister I told him I was upset that when I asked when we get there after driving eight hours if he has any plans for us and he says he didn’t  but he says we can go out and do whatever we wanna do,but that’s not any plans set makes me feel like he didn’t think about me ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-05,"AITA for not going to my boyfriends sisters celebration week?

117,1d8m5vq,AITA for telling my dad's wife she's not included in any pre-wedding activities because her one sided contest with my mom is pathetic? ,"My parents got divorced when my siblings and I were in middle school/high school. We're now in our 20s. Dad got married 2 years after the divorce. He met his wife and married her in 6 months because she was planning to move back to her home state and he didn't want to do the long distance thing. So we didn't really know her when he told us they had eloped in Vegas. She, however, thought we were all super close and was really disappointed when our reactions were pretty muted to their news.

This started her off being jealous of my mom. She was jealous of the closeness we had with mom. Then she was jealous of the fact we got along so well with our mom's partner (and we're still close) even though mom and him never got married.

Dad's wife started showing up all glam to school functions and football games that we were involved in. She looked like she was attending a wedding or a red carpet. And she'd make snarky comments about dressing up to support ""her kids"" while looking right at my mom. She would throw us these lavish birthday parties and invite both sides of our family and then attempt to dress us in matching outfits (the birthday kid and her). It always made her twitchy when we didn't want to dress like her. When my twin siblings turned 16 and my sister and mom had matching necklaces my dad's wife actually went home to change and wore the same color dress as my sister.

She talks like mom is somehow less than her because she's not remarried. She gloats that she has a ring on her finger. That she shares the same last name as us (the kids). Just all kinds of petty things. She's someone we tolerate but we don't like her and if we could exclude her from our lives without losing our dad we would.

I'm getting married and so is one of my brothers (the twin). My dad's wife has not been invited to any fittings, tastings, viewing, etc by either my fiancé and I or my brother and his fiancée. But mom has been invited to stuff on both sides and my dad's wife was so upset by it. She asked my brother about being invited to something first and he said no, just no, nothing else and she pestered him for a while before moving onto me and she broke down over it and said she can't understand not being included in pre-wedding activities. I told her she's not included because her one sided contest with my mom is pathetic and none of us want to deal with that.

She said it was such a mean thing to say and all she's ever tried to do is earn that spot as our mom but we treat our mom's partner who isn't even our stepdad like he's more important than her. She was crying harder while saying all this.

118,1d8m466,WIBTA if I don’t come stay with my Dad to care for him like I said I would 16 years ago?,"16 years ago my father, then in his early 70’s, was diagnosed stage 4 cancer. I flew out of state to be with him and my stepmother to help. 

Initially the oncologist felt he had 1-2 years to live. In a sad talk, SM shared how overwhelmed she was and asked if I would come be there when it was time. I said of course I would be. 

Later, they amended his diagnosis to 3B, which is a big change. He had chemo, which he responded so well to, he then had surgery and then radiation, and has been cancer free for many years. 

Since then he’s had many health scares. I’ve made many, many trips back both for visits and to help get him through surgeries, more cancer, other things. Some for extended periods of time. SM has gradually been putting stronger and stronger guilt trips on me to move in permanently to help. She feels I am not keeping my word I gave back when I thought he was going to die of cancer all those years ago. She’s also gotten her family in on it and some of the neighbors. 

But there are some things to consider:

1) My health is not that good. I love my dad, and I want to spend time with him. But I need to be in my own home near my own doctors and take care of my own health. 

2) They have the resources to hire help. As a matter of fact, they get an amount from their long term care insurance per day to hire help to care for Dad. I found out when I was there last that SM was having a friend help her defraud the insurance by signing the papers saying the friend was being hired to do the job. If I were there, SM could just pocket the money instead of hiring help. 

3) As it is, SM has set it up so only her son will ever inherit anything of Dad’s and hers, my siblings and I from his first marriage are shut out. I’ve made my peace with this years ago, and I love this brother very much, but now she’s getting all weird and trying to dangle their wealth in front of me like a carrot to get her way. Suggesting she’ll change her will in favor of those who help her.  ( I don’t believe this for a minute. Nothing will induce her to leave anything to Dad’s other kids.) Especially considering item #2 and the way she stands to pocket a couple thousand dollars a month if I come to stay, I am not comfortable with any of this. 

I’m trying not to be overly concerned with what people like the neighbors and SM’s relatives think. I have a history of turning my life upside down to caregive for people, which is why everyone thinks I’m the logical choice here, nobody is suggesting any of my other siblings. But I truly need to take care of myself, my condition gets worse with stress. The last time I came home from an extended period of helping it took months to recoup.

120,1d8lj1f,AITA for telling my former social worker I don't credit her for my good outcome?,"I'm a former foster kid who ended up with an incredible foster family who eventually adopted me when I turned 18 because I wanted to create those legal ties with them. I credit them with giving me a good life after 7 years of a shit one. But I don't credit my former social worker for that success at all.

So background: My mom lost custody of me when I was 5 and her older kids when they were 11 and 12. They had a different dad to me. I'm not sure what happened there but when we were first taken from our mom we were placed with a family member who eventually decided she didn't want us and we were then placed in the same foster home. But my half siblings hated me. They were always telling me I shouldn't have been born, trying to make me cry, they said my dad was dead and they were glad because he was shitty and that I was shitty too and I should be dead like him. I never knew who my father was and I don't know his name (no name on my original birth certificate). This started before we were taken into care but continued until I was finally separated from them after an incident when I was 6. 

I was placed in 7 different foster homes before finding my family. My former social worker fought against me and my half siblings being separated and even when she lost the ability to keep us together, she insisted on visits between the three of us. I told her how they treated me, I recorded it once with my family's camcorder and she didn't care. The visits stopped once my half siblings aged out of the system. It was such a relief to no longer have them in my life. I knew they hated me, I was terrified of seeing them, I used to not eat and sleep before those visits and my parents tried to protect me but they were ordered to maintain the visits. Even after they ended my former social worker would tell me I should keep in touch with my half siblings and she'd tell me I'd thank her one day.

I ran into my former social worker recently and she approached me and said I was one of her best success cases. I didn't want to hear it and I told her I don't credit her for that good outcome. That she forced me to endure years of bullying and verbal abuse at the hands of bio siblings who she knew hated me and insisted it was in my best interest when it was the worst thing she could have done. I told her that I hope she learned from it and does better but I'll never give her the credit for how great my life has become. I walked away from her and then last week I ran into her again and she told me I had no reason to be so bitter and hateful toward her and that I will one day see why she did what she did and understand she acted in my best interest. She told me to grow up and learn how to see nuance in these situations. I told her I wouldn't see shit any differently and she responded that I can't keep her a villain in my story forever.

We have a little friend group in our school and a few other people have joined, one of these people is Girl AM. Now AM is closer to R, A and T. I only met her this year and she’s in our friend group. We get along but I wouldn’t really say we’re close.

So Me, R, A and T are all having a sleep over that goes from Friday until Sunday. And I invited them since they’re my best friends and also because my mums celebrating her 43rd birthday and she wants me to have company. And well, I invited people I felt comfortable with. Which is understandable as I don’t really feel comfortable at my school.

So today I got to school and me, R, A, and T were discussing the sleepover and..someone must’ve told AM because she started planning with us, and I didn’t know how to tell her she wasn’t coming. I would’ve felt rude, so I just told R that I didn’t know what to do and I thought that was the end of it, but at first lunch. we’re sitting at our normal spot and I was discussing sleeping arrangements for me, R, and A since T is gonna be in a different room since he’s a boy.

And well AM said “I can sleep on the floor!”, and I got nervous since I’d have to tell her she wasn’t coming, so I pulled A away so we could try and figure out how to say it in a way that doesn’t sound rude. We decided just to say I didn’t have enough beds. But when we came back, she just said “I’m not coming aren’t I?” And I decided to just tell her the truth, I apologised and said that I didn’t really think about inviting her since I’m not really close with her.

She just looked sad but didn’t say anything, and left for a bit but I didn’t notice until someone said something. I didn’t hear much after but apparently she’s pissed at me and at A since she’s going to my sleepover.

Personally I feel really bad, but I don’t want to invite her since I don’t really know her and + I don’t wanna make it awkward.

I also have a very large group of friends full of people that Molly knows, but I don't have the impression that they got along incredibly well or were very close. I invited Molly and I's other friend, Ari (also a fake name, she's one of the people Molly and I are in a trio with and we hang out a lot where it's just the 3 of us, Ari is 15FM), to a group chat I had with the bigger friend group.

My stepdaughter (""K"") has been in my life since she was 8. I met my late husband when I was 34 and he was 37, K is his daughter from his previous marriage. We got married when K was 11. She was close to her mother so she never considered me a mother, but we had a good relationship. Unfortunately my husband and I weren't able to have children. Just after K finished high school she got pregnant, she'd only been dating her boyfriend for a few weeks and he didn't want to stay with her. K really wanted to keep the baby though, but she was planning to go out of state for college, so we had a long talk about it. Her mother didn't want to be involved as she was very disapproving of the whole thing. She was (justifiably I suppose) angry at K for making stupid choices that could alter her future and K sort of pulled away from her after that. So I quit my job to raise her baby (""H""). K decided to switch to a college closer to home so she could visit H every weekend. She called almost everyday to see her. She was trying very hard to balance staying connected to her child and also setting up a decent future, but obviously H was much closer to me. I was with her every day until she was four and she only saw her mom once a week and on video call. I tried telling her that K was her mom and I was grandma, and she didn't call me mom, but she was closer to me. 

  
After college K did a postgrad degree for 3 more years. Then she moved back to our city. She tried really hard to build a close relationship with H but by that time she was 7 and even though they did become close, she would always sort of come to me first for things. K was sad about this but we didn't really talk about it. Eventually K got married and H lives with them, but she visits me multiple times a week and we text every day. K's dad also passed which was really hard for both of us. So H just graduated from high school and she was selected to give a speech because she was a standout student. :) She called me and asked if it was okay if she mentions me. I said that's really sweet of her and of course. K and her husband and I went to it together.

127,1d8kgzq,AITA for not writing a letter of recommendation to help someone get their citizenship ,"
So this is what's going on. My mom works in childcare and has worked with many different kinds of families, both American citizens and not. She's always happy to help a family if they ask her for help with anything, filling out paperwork, writing letters, calling jobs, talking to teachers, helping with childrens homework, etc. And because she doesn't speak fluent English, a lot of times I am also helping those families, which I don't mind and are used to doing. The problem now is that a mother to a child we used to take care of, has asked my mother if she can help her get her citizenship by writing a letter for her describing how she's an outstanding citizen. My mom at first said yes but that she'd had to ask me for help and that she'd get back to her. When my mom said yes I can tell she felt reluctant and I asked her what was wrong, then she proceeded to tell me that this person specifically ignores her on purpose when they cross paths. (Just to add, we've driven this person and their family to the LA airport before just to turn in legal documents and we went with them to help them feel safe in case immigration took them, their daughter would stay with us because she's a US citizen). My mother said whenever she passed her on the street, this person would just look the other way and pretend to not know my mom. And this has happened and continues to happen every time they see each other. I got annoyed and said if she acts like that in public, where does she get off asking you for something so important in private? Why is she only acknowledging you when she needs to? It doesn't take much to just say hello or even just smile to someone who's helped you in the past and taken care of your child. My mom agreed with me at first but now she feels bad and says she wants to write the letter for her because she feels guilty knowing she can help but she can't write the letter without me. She thinks I'm being petty and egotistical but my sister and I don't think so. For me it isn't about ego but about self respect. If someone clearly only cares to show me decency when they need something then I don't feel the need to give more than that same energy. Should I just write it even though I know this person won't be grateful or even acknowledge my mothers existence after they get what they want? I know what I think but please tell me what you guys think.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-05,"AITA for not writing a letter of recommendation to help someone get their citizenship

I go in thursday and there's a part where I have to put in my ssn in the system. When I enter it I got an error saying that my ssn was already in use with another profile. That was obviously strange since i had never worked at a restaurant from this company, or even at all. I text my dad to let him know what's going on. He says he's on his way to my job. 

When he gets there I come out and he says. ""I think I know what's happening. Ugh it's cuz they screwed me over."" Let's call them S and C. Btw C is an immigrant. (My father's cousin and her wife) He then continues and says ""S and C asked me for your ssn and they promised they would only use it to actually get C the job and nothing else. C happens to be working at the same company, in a different part of town. It took everything in me not to get angry. We went to C’s workplace, my father told her them that she was working with my ssn. I think my father was trying to fix my situation now, but he was acting as if they had gone and stolen my ssn without him knowing. When he's the one who literally gave it to them. C has been working for several months. 

My father dropped me off at my mom's house. She then noticed I was a little off. I told her, i can't start working yet. She asked why. I told her everything. I could notice she was angry. “This is the ONE thing i asked of him when we were married. TO NEVER USE you or your brother's ssn for anything no matter what.” she said. We go to my fathers house. He and my brother were outside unloading groceries, and she gets out of the car and yells at him. She told me, “even a few years ago when I had just come back into the country and was struggling to even find a job as an illegal, I didn't even think about ever using your ssn.”

The next day my mom and i went to the police station and a made a filed a report about all 3 of them. The deputy who assisted us help us write the report and told us to go to the ssa. Although why didn’t they use my aunt’s son’s ssn? Still would’ve been wrong but they could’ve. Why use mine?
I do feel kind of bad for reporting them. I did/do care about my fathers’s cousin. I call her aunt. Now my aunt’s wife might get deported and even if she doesn’t she’ll never be able to get her citizenship now. Also there was barely anything done to my credit score. So maybe it was an overreaction bc there wasn't much damage. If she had done more under my ssn. I would've had to get a new ssn, the lady who assisted us said it would've been a more lengthy and complicated process. She told me, it actually wouldn’t hurt keeping that on there. Tho she said she could wipe it. I said i prefer that. Tbh i’m not completely how this all works i’m only 16. Haven’t been out in the world much.

131,1d8jht8,AITA for crying because my dad made me vacuum even though I told him I have sensory issues and hate the vacuum.,"I (17f) have adhd and autism. Unfortunately I went undiagnosed until this year and so I grew up without any accommodations for things like sensory issues. One of my biggest sensory issues is sounds, I am very sensitive to loud sounds. One of those sounds is the vacuum. That compiled with the fact that when I was 8 my dad knowing I hated the vacuum decided to tell me a “joke” about the vacuum which was if you run over the chord, the vacuum will explode and kill you. 

I now know obviously that what he said wasn’t true but as a little kid I believed him. This only made me dislike them more.

Growing up my mom compromised by allowing me to clean dishes or the bathroom while my brother or her would vacuum. I always carried my weight it’s just that they knew I hated the sound of them and so being nice took on that chore so I wouldn’t have too. I still always vacuumed my room but my mom being the saint that she is bought me headphones so I wouldn’t have to hear it. 

My dad however loves to play “jokes” which to be honest aren’t really jokes. He told us my grandma was coming over and we had to clean the house. I offered to do any and every chore that wasn’t vacuuming. I said I would literally do every other chore by myself just to not vacuum. My dad promised I wouldn’t have to and went to make a list evenly distributing the chores amongst all of us.

When he came back the only chore on my side of the list was vacuuming. We live in a 3 story condo and he wanted me to vacuum the whole thing. I didn’t have my headphones there and would have to hear it the whole time. I begged him to let me do my brother’s side of the chores or even his or even both just not the vacuum and he said no.

I did it but I cried the whole time because of sensory overload. I really tried my best to get it done and quickly so he wouldn’t be mad at me but he called me a cry baby and told me to grow up. Now, I haven’t told him that I have autism but he does know I have adhd and he even has adhd himself. I told him sensory issues are a part of adhd and explained it to him as an adhd thing because I didn’t want to tell him that I’m autistic. He used to make fun of me when I was younger and called me autistic as a way to say that I’m dumb. So, I don’t know if this was just a lack of knowledge/understanding that caused this and if maybe I should have told him I’m autistic and if that would have helped.

I also wonder if I’m in the wrong and should have just vacuumed without complaint or tears. Any advice?

Edit: I have headphones that I use to cope with loud sounds that I bring with me everywhere. However, at the time this specific thing occurred I was 11, not yet diagnosed, and suspecting that I was autistic. Being 11 I forgot the headphones from time to time. Specifically when I went to my dad’s because at my dad’s it was always quiet and so bringing the headphones didn’t always cross my mind.

132,1d8jfty,AITA for Telling My Stepmom She Can’t Blame Me for My Dad Cheating,"My (20F) dad (45M) married my stepmom (42F), about three years ago.

A few months ago, my dad started acting weird. He was on his phone a lot, sneaking out late at night, and lying about where he was. One night, about three months ago, I overheard him on the phone saying some pretty explicit things to someone who was definitely not my stepmom. After a few days of agonizing over it, I decided to confront him. He admitted he was cheating on my stepmom and begged me not to tell her. He said he’d end the affair and work on his marriage. I believed him and kept quiet, hoping he’d actually follow through.

Well, fast forward a month, and my stepmom finds out anyway. She is staying with my dad, so things are good on that end, but somehow she is absolutely livid with me, saying I betrayed her trust by not telling her. She keeps telling me I’m just as guilty as he is for not coming to her right away. Since then my step mom has been giving me the cold shoulder, and when she does talk to me, it's just to yell or blame me for everything. It’s gotten to the point where I dread being at home. My dad’s trying to smooth things over, but he’s not doing a great job. He keeps telling me to just stay out of it and give my stepmom time to cool off and try to avoid her as much as possible.

A few months ago, my dad started acting weird. He was on his phone a lot, sneaking out late at night, and lying about where he was. One night, about three months ago, I overheard him on the phone saying some pretty explicit things to someone who was definitely not my stepmom. After a few days of agonizing over it, I decided to confront him. He admitted he was cheating on my stepmom and begged me not to tell her. He said he’d end the affair and work on his marriage. I believed him and kept quiet, hoping he’d actually follow through.

Well, fast forward a month, and my stepmom finds out anyway. She is staying with my dad, so things are good on that end, but somehow she is absolutely livid with me, saying I betrayed her trust by not telling her. She keeps telling me I’m just as guilty as he is for not coming to her right away. Since then my step mom has been giving me the cold shoulder, and when she does talk to me, it's just to yell or blame me for everything. It’s gotten to the point where I dread being at home.

As a gift my parents got me a cruise. It was also for my 18th birthday. It was also a family vacation. We usually stay at all inclusive resorts but I have always wanted to go on a cruise. 

I told my parents it was different and that if we went on excursions we had to follow the schedule no matter what. 

Well it was a week-long cruise and they would not head back to the ship when I said it was time to go. They were busy shopping and bargaining with the locals. I finally said that I was heading back to the ship. My mom waved me off. 

The missed the departure. By a lot. Like 45 minutes. They got ahold of me through WhatsApp. They wanted to know why I didn't get the boat to wait for them.  

I wanted to scream that they were not going to inconvenience 3,998 people because two could not understand what a schedule was. 

They ended up having to fly to the next port from there and it was expensive. They are pissed at me for leaving them behind.

134,1d8j7pq,AITA for telling my roommate I don’t want her dad’s dog to stay with us permanently? ,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible but there’s so many details in this. 

I (f25) hve two roommates who I’ll call Doreen (f23) and Matt (m25) who are dating. We moved out together after Doreen and her father had a validly dramatic fallout last year in December. We agreed on a set of rules where nothing would be decided unless we all talked and agreed about the subject.

Lately, Doreen has been making decisions on her own without discussing anything with anyone in the house but because her and Matt are dating he automatically agrees to make her happy and none of them were my hill to die on. 

The most recent decision was to take her father’s dog under her wing since her dad has confessed that he no longer wants to take care of her. For some background, the dog hasn’t been taken care of properly for years and hasn’t been bathed in almost a year. Her dad works night shift and sleeps during the day so he doesn’t pay attention to the dog and claims that she gets into too much trouble which is virtually impossible.

Facts about the dog: she is 9-10 years old, morbidly obese, has trouble breathing, smells absolutely rancid even afterDoreen gave her a bath, bites anyone that tries to give her love and is in the way 90% of the time(she will lay in random places that make you unable to open certain drawers such as the garbage) and can barely walk. 

I’ve told Doreen in the past that I don’t mind the dog staying with us for a week at a time but do NOT want the dog here permanently mostly because I physically cannot be around the dog without being repulsed and annoyed when she’s in the way. Doreen agreed that we’d have to have an extensive conversation about the dog staying permanently before anything else so I had nothing to worry about. A few days ago her dad was supposed to come back for the dog so I went out to give them space only to come back to the dog still being here. I asked her why and she simply said “you’re almost never here anyways what’s the big deal?” (I work long hours at a restaurant whereas she wfh) I was speechless and simply left the room pissed. 

I havent talked to Matt or Doreen since and am seething every second because the house smells like ass 24/7 and she clearly sees nothing wrong with making such a huge decision without talking about it first. We now have two dogs and a cat in the house which I did not agree to so please tell me if Im TA on this one.

Idk if I’m TA because I get that the dog is dying but her father needs to take responsibility for once in his life instead of throwing an extra pet on us.

We had been planning this move for months, touring apartments, budgeting and looking at furniture stores. Because we were all freshman in college, we were planning on using our summer jobs after school ends to save up to move in at the middle / end of July. We planned to all have jobs by the beginning of May, after the semester was over, in order to have the paystubs and money to get the apartment. We even made a decision to kind of sacrifice our ideal jobs for the sake of time, and if we needed to, such as getting fast food or retail jobs.

However, it’s now June and neither of them have gotten anything, and barely have been applying. I ended up getting a retail job at the beginning of may like we planned and have been saving my portion of the rent.

 Besides that, they have been very rude to me for no apparent reason :( they messaged me asking how much I make at my job so they can “make sure they make more than me”. I asked them to hang out on the only day I was off and they said no, they’re busy. Then I see them hanging out together 😭 they made me pick them up during the school year and never give me gas money (which I didn’t necessarily mind) but now that they have their own cars for the summer they won’t give me rides. They make fun of me constantly for things I can’t control appearance-wise and socially. They make fun of my interests and hobbies and then copy them

I (33F) was on my way home from work tonight and as I was pulling in Hell's Bells by AC/DC came on the radio, this was my dad's favorite song (he passed away about 4 years ago from lung cancer) so I admit I was already in my feelings on top of also being about 8 months pregnant.. Anyways, I walked in and my sister had one of my Dad's old sculptures that he had made while attending the Art Institute of Pittsburgh on the kitchen table, it was a sculpture of a human head, half of it was a skull and the other half was made to appear as muscle. He made this over 20 years ago and it was on display in our home all throughout our childhood, although apparently unfinished and some describing it as creepy, it was still something my dad had made by hand and holds a lot of sentimental value, especially now that he has passed. She had painted over it.. and glued aquarium gravel around the base. I took one look at it and couldn't stop myself from saying ""why would you do that??"" She came over and started explaining that it was 'sticky' and she just wanted to finish an unfinished project and kept asking what I meant, I asked her why she would do anything to it at all, it had been like that for over 20 years. She got very defensive and I didn't want her to feel like I was criticizing her but I immediately started crying and went outside. When I came back in she had gone to bed..

141,1d8hwx4,AITA for going off on my friend for always choosing his gf over me,"My (m21) friend (m20) has a gf that he has had since he was in like 5th grade. We have been friends since like sophomore year, group of 4 guys. We used to hang out a bit more back in school but really this has always been a problem. No matter what if his gf is free, he will be with her. If we have plans and she becomes free, he will cancel and be with her basically. If we are in the middle of hanging out and she goes on break at work, he literally ends the meet and goes to be with her on her break or leaves for an hour and comes back (this bugs me the most). We are so low on his important list that we meet like once a month. Back then when we were like 18 I would ask the group like every day to hang out but now I wait for them to initiate it usually. 

The main problem where I went off came when I would try to plan something and I'll say for even years that I wanna go on like a trip to some place, he would like kinda on board then at the end be like oh actually my gf wants to do that and she actually said that she wanted to first so I'm gonna do it with her instead.This happened so many times. A good example being I wanted to go to this springs like a couple hours away so I been like guys we gotta go to this springs, sporadically for over 2 years. He was even like lol imagine I went to the springs with my gf instead, and I was like lol I'd be so pissed. 6 months go by and guess what, his gf actually mentioned she wanted to go to the springs long before I did so now she's top priority.

They like Disney but this same thing happened kinda for a movie that wasn't Disney. My other friends back him up saying ""I'm saying ---- got a lot on his plate, if he starts hanging with us more Jenny gonna feel neglected and express that to cleb which will make cleb sad and make tension in the relationship"" and ""When you get a gf and really want the girl you gonna have to choose between boys and her sometimes"" WE MEET ONCE A MONTH.

We were talking to my older brother about a t.v show we watch when my mother calls me up the stairs to get her something to drink.

She hands me her cup and asks me if I knew if there was any tea left. I hadn't opened the fridge so I didn't know so I said,I don't know. She then asks me why I am laughing when I am honestly just smiling and nervous and for once I was having a good time. I try to tell her that I am not laughing but she cuts me off and calls me stupid saying that if I hadn't drunk any then it should still be there.

I grab her cup and proceed to fill it up with the tea. I have to flip the burgers so I take a little longer than usual when she yells at me again. I give her her cup and I ask her if she wanted ice. She then looks at me, takes a sip and then yells at me to of course out some ice in it because she makes drinks really sweet and it was ice tea. She then calls me stupid again. As I fill up her cup.

I make it all the way up to her room and decide to tell her how I feel when she yells at me and calls me stupid so I say in the steadiest voice I could muster ""No offense, but could you please not take your bad mood out on me."" For the record there have been far more incidents similar and worse than this one that has prompted me to say this.

Not even two minutes later she goes downstairs to yell at me and my twin sister and says: ""this is the way I am and have always been and I won't change that for anyone."" She then says I ruined her good mood and that she had been laughing about what she said to me. My sister and I both try to explain to her that what she's saying is almost exactly what I was saying because she felt that I hurt her feelings but she then did what she does best and cut me off and just repeated what she said.

(I do feel like I could've apologized right there for making her feel bad that's where I think I was a bit of an asshole.)

My twin sister still tries to reason with her and pushes me out of the room when she says. ""That she hates talking to us, and that we aren't here enough to make an impact."" She then proceeds to talk down on us with a whole bunch of hurtful words that made my sister cry.

I don't think I'm the asshole and I certainly didn't show any disrespect to that hypocrite when she yelled at me, but in that moment I had really hoped that she had died in the hospital two moths ago.

They didn't have a credit score (even though they're over 30) so nobody wanted to rent to them. I wanted to help and they hadn't yet given me a reason not to trust them, so I co-signed their lease.

They just wanted to relax after ""working hard to get where they are"" which was working part time at a dead end job with their girlfriend and family supporting them. Unsurprisingly, we broke up.

After that, I called the property manager, and she told me the only way for me to be taken off the lease was if my ex found someone to take over as co-signer.

144,1d8hnof,AITA for giving my mum tickets to my daughter's school play,"I (45f) had a row with my husband (48m) who thinks I'm being TA.

My parents in law live 2 hours away in the same town as my SIL.  She doesn't work and is very organised, her husband was made redundant a year ago so is also at home but money isn't an issue.  My husband and I work full time (he stays away three nights a week) and I struggle to plan more than a few weeks ahead (honestly just always chasing my tail). My mother lives near us and our kids are the only grandchildren in the same country.

My mum helps us a lot so probably does something once or twice a week e.g. will look after one child so I can take the other to the doctor.  My parents in law offer to help but have never been able to because my sister in law has booked them up beforehand.  This has happened even when I try to ask well in advance (e.g I asked 4 months in advance if they could help as my kids weren't invited to a wedding and 6 months in advance as I'm trying to take my mum to visit my brother overseas for her 70th) both times they have said no because they are taking my SILs kids to sports competitions (apparently they've agreed to do every Saturday).  I am sad because I feel like my kids are missing out but it's their choice and they are wonderful grandparents who my kids love.

Anyway, my daughter is in a school play - she's not a very big part but it's a fairly big deal for her and she has been working really hard.  Due to space each family is limited to 4 tickets.  My husband, son and I are going and I offered the 4th ticket to my mum.  My husband thinks I should have given his mother first dibs because 'she gets to see our kids less'.  I think my mum helps so much it would be a bit of a kick in the teeth not to involve her in this.  Also since my dad died I am conscious she's a bit lonely so things like this are a bit of a treat.

145,1d8hmj9,WIBTA for ruining a Girl's Trip and ended the friendship after their Intervention for me?,"EDIT: Names are fake...

In July 2022. a friend 'Nancy' wanted to take her mom 'Ruby' to SLC, Utah for a Girl’s Weekend to celebrate her birthday. We all made agreements to split the cost 5 ways for the hotel stay, gas, and food. Not our spending money we wanted buy or eat there.

Now, I do want to point out I was 280 lbs, I have struggled walking and standing on my feet for a long time. I am a pre-diabetic, and wore compression socks. I knew there were plenty of seats wherever we went, and I made sure that I had fun.

Nancy, Ruby, Barb, Kathy, and I (OP) left on a Friday, got to SLC, went to Top Golf, ate, and went to bed. Saturday we went to IKEA shopping, In N’ Out Burger at noon, then the mall. Afterward, we go back to the hotel to take a dip in the pool, and get ready to go to Cheesecake Factory, but we didn’t eat until 9:30-10pm.

When it got to dinnertime, I was hangry. (again Pre-D, 8 hours of no food). After eating, I went straight to bed, and heard Nancy, Barb, and Kathy talking about me, which I didn't care about.

Sunday comes, they want to go shopping again before going home. I was tired and ready to go home, but I kept my mouth shut and stayed with Ruby. After a few more hours, we were finally heading back home.

A MONTH LATER!

The Barb asks me to meet them at a restaurant. I got there, got us a table, and waited for them. Nancy, Barb, and Kathy all came in together, and started eating and chatting… soon Barb sitting beside me, said that they loved me, but we needed to talk about what happened on the trip. This was an INTERVENTION ON ME!

They brought up everything I did ‘wrong’ on the trip:

I AM a BTS ARMY. They told me that I needed to stop talking about BTS. (Okay, so I’m not allowed to talk about my favorite group, but YOU can talk about YOUR favorites?)

I whined and complained about my feet hurting. (duh, overweight)

I never told them I was going ahead of them or where I was going (I went around the corner to sit down, so I really wasn’t far ahead of the group or checking stuff out, but always went back to them).

I was to leave my phone in the hotel room while Nancy, Ruby, Barb, Kathy, and I went to the pool. (it’s my phone).

I didn’t tell Nancy, Barb, or Kathy that I went to sit in the waiting area for dinner. (I did tell Nancy).

And on our way home, it was a childless vacation, I shouldn’t have messaged or talked to my son while I was away and on the way back. (Seriously? He was staying with his dad and we were picking him up on the way home.)

During this, I COULDN’T LEAVE! I was in the corner and I WASN’T ALLOWED to SPEAK! (I tried!) No ‘thank you for coming'. No ‘thank you for staying with mom’. Not even ‘GOOD JOB on walking over 5 miles’.

After it was done, I bit my tongue, went home, and blew up with my true BFFs at everything, and they couldn’t believe what Nancy, Barb, and Kathy did.

I knew what I had to do. I paid Nancy back for the golf, gas, hotel, and food with a receipt, and I started avoiding them. and I ended the friendship.

146,1d8hjd2,AITA for kicking my friend out of my wedding for accusing me of stealing?,"AITA for kicking my friend out of my wedding for accusing my of stealing? 

Throw away, so no one recognizes  me. I 21 female kicked my friend (&roomie)24 female out of my bridal party after she accused me of stealing. Things were great, until one day when I got a text from her, asking about her bridesmaid dress. I chose bridesmaid dresses that I found affordable, considering all my bridesmaids are young and either just finished or were in college. I also told all of them, that if there was any cost were too much for them, to preach out. I didn’t want any one of them to not be able to be in my bridal party due to cost. I sent them a group text, telling them to each reach out separately when they were ready to buy the dress, and I’d send the link, since everyone had different styles. 
A few months later, this friend reached out about the dress & I got a quick text back asking for me to pay the express shipping, since it wouldn’t be there in time to have alterations if anything didn’t fit correctly. I was surprised, since I told them all the date to order it by. I didn’t think that this was on me & my fiance suggested I tell her that. I kindly sent a text back, saying that since I gave everyone a date explaining why I didn’t think I should. I will add that shipping was not very expensive, and she was open about having a lot of money to just spend. She shopped a lot & always bragged how her parents paid for almost everything. I was hurt that she wouldn’t just pay for the shipping as if it wasn’t important to her.
After this, she sent me a text asking if I took her shoes that she couldn’t find. I was surprised by the text and told her no. She spent a lot of nights at her boyfriend’s house, and came home looking for things she eventually found at his house later. Once I came back from class early and found her digging through my dresser. I asked her what she was doing she left my room w/out saying anything & sent me a text saying she knew I was taking her stuff & was calling authorities. I had kind of hoped she would because then she would realize I hadn’t taken anything. The next day I got another text asking for a specific shirt, telling me she looked through my closet and laundry but didn’t find it but knew I was hiding it. I told her I didn’t take it. Later she told our other roommate she found the shirt at her boyfriends, but I never got an apology. 
I sent her a message, because she wouldn’t agree to a phone call, telling her I had thought about it and decided it was best she wasn’t in my wedding but I hoped we could remain friends. She told me she was so relieved I told her before she dress arrived and she’d cancel the order. 
I thought I made the right call and after her response, she confirmed for me she wasn’t acting like someone who I’d want in such a special role. 
However one of our mutual friends said he thought I was being a bit rude and shouldn’t have kicked her out.

I sent them a group text, telling them to each reach out separately when they were ready to buy the dress, and I’d send the link, since everyone had different styles. 
A few months later, this friend reached out about the dress & I got a quick text back asking for me to pay the express shipping, since it wouldn’t be there in time to have alterations if anything didn’t fit correctly. I was surprised, since I told them all the date to order it by. I didn’t think that this was on me & my fiance suggested I tell her that. I kindly sent a text back, saying that since I gave everyone a date explaining why I didn’t think I should. I will add that shipping was not very expensive, and she was open about having a lot of money to just spend. She shopped a lot & always bragged how her parents paid for almost everything. I was hurt that she wouldn’t just pay for the shipping as if it wasn’t important to her.
After this, she sent me a text asking if I took her shoes that she couldn’t find. I was surprised by the text and told her no. She spent a lot of nights at her boyfriend’s house, and came home looking for things she eventually found at his house later. Once I came back from class early and found her digging through my dresser. I asked her what she was doing she left my room w/out saying anything & sent me a text saying she knew I was taking her stuff & was calling authorities. I had kind of hoped she would because then she would realize I hadn’t taken anything. The next day I got another text asking for a specific shirt, telling me she looked through my closet and laundry but didn’t find it but knew I was hiding it. I told her I didn’t take it. Later she told our other roommate she found the shirt at her boyfriends, but I never got an apology. 
I sent her a message, because she wouldn’t agree to a phone call, telling her I had thought about it and decided it was best she wasn’t in my wedding but I hoped we could remain friends. She told me she was so relieved I told her before she dress arrived and she’d cancel the order. 
I thought I made the right call and after her response, she confirmed for me she wasn’t acting like someone who I’d want in such a special role. 
However one of our mutual friends said he thought I was being a bit rude and shouldn’t have kicked her out.

147,1d8hj9g,AITA for telling my sister I want to move out? ,"I (34M) moved into my sister's (39F with 3 kids) house three and a half years ago, after she went through a nasty divorce. I moved in because she was struggling financially and emotionally, I pay the entire rent ($2.3k) plus internet and some food about $3k after everything. Moving in also increased my commute to 2 hours each way, so I don't even count the $800 | spend on gas and toll fees.

Two out of the three kids (13,10,4) have Autism, with one being none verbal. My sister works a night time job (40k per year) so I know she won't be able to afford living in current home we are renting. Keep in mind she rented this home with her ex husband, so they could afford it at one point. She won't go after her ex for child support and refuses to look into assistance from the government. She doesn't do any upkeep on the house and it is quite frankly a mess, I pick up after myself but feel that she should clean up after her children.

My sister is extremely smart but horrible with money, l've probably given her close to 100k since I became an adult, not counting the over 90k l've paid in rent living with her. She refuses to face her problems and just buries her head until my dad or I rescue her. I reminded her of my plan to move out in March of 2025, she didn’t like it and stated that she doesn’t want to talk about it. 

I have a great career ($185k/per year) and really want to start looking at settling down and getting married, I also plan on moving out of state or going fully remote. I chose to not have children and feel like she needs to figure out her life. Coddling her and just rescuing her clearly isn't helping her.

149,1d8hhct,AITA for not allowing my mother to invite her friends to my wedding,"So my fiancée (F, 27) and I (M, 26) are getting married in November. We have been planning our wedding for nearly a year now. Throughout the planning process, my mother has been absent at best when it came to helping, always claiming to want but would book events for her business on the dates we would agree to meet to work on planning or trying on suits for me. We got her to meet for dress shopping for the mothers, but that became a disaster since when we got there, my mom refused to try on any dresses, which was very difficult throughout the day. My mom has been firmly saying that her responsibility is the rehearsal dinner. She states that putting this event on is the groom's family's job. Meanwhile, my future MIL has been very involved in the wedding planning. She has supported me throughout the last couple of months, helping us understand and make important decisions, and assisting with suit shopping (which she cried at LOL).

Anyway, about two weeks ago my mother started talking to us about our rehearsal dinner, and how its the grooms families job to pay for it. We were unbelievably appreciative of this, and had suggested some cheaper options, but she decided to do it at a very upscale local restaurant. While going over the guest list with my fiancée, we became aware that one of my brothers is bringing a date. My fiancée informed my mother that we aren't doing plus ones for people, so we needed to know who this person is. That is when things took a turn for the worst. My mother then said that “etiquette states” that everyone gets a plus one. Well we aren't doing that, we’re paying for our own wedding with some financial help from my fiancée’s parents, but not a lot, and so we want to keep the cost down. My mother then asked which of her friends were invited, and my fiancée asked which ones she gave us contact information for when we needed that earlier this year to send save the dates. She responded with none, she only gave addresses for family.  Keep in mind, my own mother was excluding me from this conversation, so my fiancée finally says that mother needs to speak with me about this as she is at work and busy. My mother gets very very upset. 
Fast forward to this week. My mother is now refusing to tell us who she's inviting, and is now disregarding our wishes on how the rehearsal dinner will be planned, demanding to see our guest list and all their contact information. We are refusing to give it to her. Tonight she blew up on us in a group chat that also included my future MIL and father, and now refuses to help with the wedding at all, and personally attacked my future MIL.

150,1d8hf4j,AITA for accidentally telling someone his Fiance was throwing his stuff out from their apartment?,"So, I (18f) was supposed to hang out with my boyfriend (19m) one on one for the first time in ages, but he ended up telling me he was helping his friend (21f) throw her fiances (24m) stuff out if the apartment.

As far as I know, both the friend and her fiance have been having a hard time lately and haven't been on the best of terms. I knew that she would be okay, since her and my boyfriend are good friends and he would support her, so I checked on her fiance since I also consider him a friend.

I thought he knew about this, and I wanted to see if he was dealing with it okay.

Turns out he didn't, and a few minutes later, I got some very angry texts from my boyfriend about it. I felt horrible, and my boyfriend told me I was a ""f*cking degenerate"", that I need to shut my mouth, and that this situation was why he doesn't like telling me things.

I was hurt, and decided to pick up my bag of clothes I keep ay my boyfriend house on Friday. I aplohized and said that I know that won't fix it, and he told me I shouldn't break things in the first place.

I feel like an asshole now, especially considering that I work with my boyfriend and our friend (she's a manager) and will have to face the backlash for accidentlly revealing to the fiance that she was getting rid of his stuff. They live with four other people also, so he would have either been told by someone else or found out when he got back from work. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend thinks I'm the asshole for telling our friends fiance that his stuff was getting thrown out by her, and for ruining their plans.

151,1d8hdoh,AITA for not sharing my inheritance with my step sister?,"I 28f have just received a fairly large inheritance. It includes a farm with 80 acres of land with 2 seperate houses on it and just over over $750,000 in cash among other things from my grandparents.

My step sister 32f and I have never been close. When my mum and step dad got together she made it quite clear that we aren't family and she doesn't like me or my mum. She's a single mum with 4 kids and is really struggling. Our country is in the middle of a housing crisis and a cost of living crisis and they have just been evicted from their rental property for non payment of rent. They are currently living in one room at a pretty crappy motel paid for by the government. 

My husband and I already own a nice 3 bedroom unit and are fairly financially comfortable even without my inheritance due to alot of hard work on our part. 

When my inheritance came through I gifted my mum and step dad the money to clear their mortgage so they now own their own home along with enough to go on their dream holiday. As soon as my step sister found out about the inheritance she called me being all sweet and nice for about 5 minutes asking about my husband and 2 kids etc then asked when she would be getting her share of the money and when they could move into the largest house on the farm. It took me about 5 seconds to start laughing before telling her that I'll only be helping family. I hung up and blocking her. 

I'm now being called a selfish, spoilt brat by quite a few people. I feel as she has never treated us as anything but scum she doesn't deserve anything. I do feel bad for the kids and want to set up a small trust fund for each of them that they can only access when they turn 18.

Edit: for anyone wondering the inheritance came from my deceased dad's parents who I've had little contact with and came as a huge suprise. I honestly know what it's like to grow up with not alot

So I went to my sister house. My boys are 3&4. Hers is 2. They were playing in the living room. We were in the dining room. When we got done eating my sister went to the restroom and I picked up our plates.

I then went to the living room and the boys were playing and Eating. I watched the show they were watching and then sat on the couch and got out my tablet. My sister comes in and picks up the kids plates and goes nd sits on the couch. She then looks up at the tv and screams ""what happened to my fn tv?"" I look up and it's cracked at the bottom and there is a line through the tv. Mind you it was not there 3ish mins before.

She gets up and starts screaming bloody mutter and my kids! Blaming them. She was screaming so bad she turned red almost blue. She calls her husband and so forth. She then sits on the couch bf doesn't talk to me the rest of the night. She told me later she stopped talking to me because if she had she would of kicked us out. Mind you we were in a state we are not from.

Now back story.. I had just told her I won at the casino and still had 2,000 on me.

So next morning I left. She called out dad to have him make me pay for the tv. Of course he said he wasn't going to be involved.

So the time she was yelling she kept saying it was a $2000 tv... so she texted telling me I needed to pay her the money and I told her to send the tv. She sent me the picture. The tv was actually only $1000... she goes it's on sale... it wasn't. It would have said that the tv was originally $2,000 but on sale for $1000. And it didn't say that. It said its original price was $1000.

We argued because no one knows what happened I was sitting there nothing ever hit the tv! I would of heard it. The boys were playing really well no one was throwing at that time.

She told me to pay half and was done with the conversation. I thought about it. I decided that I wasn't going to pay. First you don't scream at my kids like she did. It's a tv. Tv is a material thing! Family is suppose to be number 1. Second she lied to me about the price. She knew I had 2,000 from winning and she wanted the money. 3rd she never blamed her child only mine.

I told her I wouldn't pay anything because when you bring people to your house sometimes things break. And if my kids had broke. The tv I would have paid. But nothing hit that tv.

She decided that a tv was more important than our relationship. And she to have. Good life.

I confronted her about it but she dismissed the topic. Now 2 days ago she blasted on me asking why adam is texting me and starts telling me that I'm a sl*t and i stole her crush. I mean im kinda shocked. 

I told her again and again that if u want i can introduce her to adam but she said he is too young for her. Now i dont know what to do? . Adam is my good friend now and i also told that to sandra that we are strictly platonic but she is now telling my other friends that i am a sl*t. 

P.S. i have learned my lesson and wont interfere in anyones business.",0.0,0.06947854161262512,0,1
154,1d8h91e,AITA for wanting insurance money from a car I bought my mom and then she totaled a year later,"In The height of the pandemic I was fired from my job and filed for an unemployment It took over 7 months to get approved and I used some of that money to replace my mom's vehicle because my parents are in older age and financially unable to just Go buy a vehicle.

When I got back to work I proceeded to start getting my finances back in order and one of those things was getting car insurance again. My parents and I had been driving for most of the pandemic without insurance so we decided to throw them on my policy under the understanding that they could pay half because they have two vehicles and I am a single person with one car which we agreed was more than fair. 

 The car I bought her went to crap after about a year and a half and so when my new employer was downsizing I came to an agreement with my work that I would buy one of the Vans for $3,000 total coming out of each of my paychecks and Mom agreed to pay me back for it which she successfully did. 

She has owned the van for a little over 6 months and 2 weeks ago she was in an accident that the insurance has deemed The van totaled for a large amount over the amount we paid. Between the insurance and the car I bought her in the pandemic, it equals out to right around the amount that she would get back if she were to reimburse herself for money that she'd paid for the van. 

Over the last 8 months my parents have completely stopped paying their portion and I trying to be the good son continue to pay the bill. 

My parents are both in their upper 60s and they're both talking about retiring. I deal with all maintenance around the house and vehicles, oil changes, tire rotation, things of that nature are all done by me because they cannot afford to pay and have it done.

My mother has said that she does not owe me any of the money because she pays my phone bill and brings home groceries that I never eat. I work 60 to 70 hours a week.

155,1d8h2al,AITA for lying and going into the office?,"Growing up my grandmother raised me until I was 12. My whole life my grandma took me to work with her during summers when I was in school. She got me ready for school everyday and cooked all of my meals. She was the disciplinarian and to this day I view her as my mother.

My mom worked a lot. But when she wasn’t working she wasnt with me. She traveled to Barbados, Aruba, Jamaica, and many other trips for a week at a time with her friends. Even when she took me to Mexica a few times as a child she sat by the pool and drank and had her friends take me snorkeling and had me do kid stuff at the resort. 

She is 48yrs old I am 28 and she acts retired. She’s on disability for “social anxiety” but volunteers at every veteran and polish club you can think of. She goes out with friends and her bf who is as old as my grandpa. 

I have a 7yr and a newborn and I work from home except on Wednesdays. She watches the baby on that day. Now that summer is here and school is out I asked her if she could please come over more during the week to help me a little Because even tho I work from home I still have to work. I have deadlines I have to meet which she is aware of. 

She said she could help one extra day a week which I said I would make work. She volunteers all the other days and in the evenings. So I schedule all of my meetings on the 2 days she is helping. Since summer has started she has not came over to help one full day. She has come over for a few hours (minus Wednesdays when I go in to the office) and typically still has me feed the baby or talks to me while I am working. I feel behind at work and I have told her this. She has 2 vacations set for the summer each a week long so I had to take my vacation during those same days since I will have no support on Wednesdays.

So I lied. I told her before her vacation my boss was making me go into the office since I was going on vacation. She changed all of her plans and adjusted her bfs dr appointments to watch the kids. I am going to be at the office one extra day during the weeks before her vacation so I can feel like my projects are in a good space. AITA for lying about having to go into work?

So, I'm currently traveling with a friend I met through a hostel about a week ago. The other night, we were sitting at a bar with a girl we met, and everything was chill until my friend got into an argument with one of the bartenders. There was some tension between them, but we tried to move past it.

As we were getting ready to pay the bill, my friend became aggressive toward the same bartender. They started arguing over the bill being in a foreign language instead of English—a pretty dumb argument, in my opinion. The girl and I decided to just pay our share and told my friend what he owed. As we were leaving, I apologized to another bartender for my friend's behavior.

My friend noticed me apologizing and immediately started yelling at me, saying I wasn't his parent and had no right to apologize for him. He got really offended. He also mentioned that the bartender he argued with wasn't behaving right either, which I did notice.

The next day, my friend told me he felt like I stabbed him in the back with a knife by apologizing for him. He was really upset and felt betrayed.

I was taken back because I don’t feel any difference in our relationship but I apologized to her that I made her feel this way and promised to do better. 

Today, she expresses that she and her S.O. Are going through a rough patch and she was having a horrible day. Here I do my best to basically say what she is going though is tough but  I’m here for her if she needs me. After our brief conversation, she didn’t bring it up again. 

Before the work day ended, she asked me if I wanted to get food with her if I didn’t end up going on a date today (I mentioned it to her a few days ago). I told
Her yes if the date ends up being cancelled but I didn’t know if the date was still Happening or not at that point, but she agrees to wait for me to find out.  

She then gets home, doesn’t say hi and goes straight to her room. I soon after get confirmation that the date is still happening so I let her know and how I’m

The people in the row behind us decided to sit the entire show. They continued to make comments to my friends, and amongst themselves about how selfish we were for standing and dancing during the concert.

I have zero regrets and don’t feel bad whatsoever. We all have free will. I chose to stand and dance, they chose to sit and be lame. Am I the asshole? 


Edit: Just to clarify some things.

The band is a psychedelic jam band, so I would say a decent portion of the people at this show are on their substance of choice. 

The venue was on the smaller side, holds about 5,000 people. The GA tickets were significantly more expensive than the seated tickets (maybe mezzanine wasn’t the correct word). I’d say about 75-80% of the crowd was standing, not including GA. And in our section, the few rows in front of us, there were maybe 20? people standing. I didn’t turn around much, if at all, so I can’t speak on what the back of the section was doing.

Its been leas than a month but her bf lives w her and its become apparent that he isnt happy Im there. He doesn’t like sharing any sort of attention of my moms and gets very competitive with anyone who gets in the way of that including my nieces.

Lately if im in the same space as them he becomes controlling, interrupts out conversations and tries to start arguments about trivial things. 
Last night he started arguing with me about what vegetables were in the garden. It began with a simple conversation of me telling my mom that the plant that she thought was watermelon was actually zucchini as you could see the squash blossoms and the vegetable actually growing out of it. He ran over to the plants and got out his plant app and started mansplanning which each plant was. When I attempted to correct him about the zucchini which he insisted was pumpkin he then aggressively turned on me and started yelling “Of course YOU would know. I KNEW that YOU would KNOW!” This went on for a few minutes as his yelling this same thing over again incessantly got louder. I excused myself and went to my room to not escalate the situation any further. 

Tonight about 10 minutes before he came home he left me a text message and a voicemail, apologizing and saying that he has a character defect of sarcasm and that he was trying to be funny. I didn’t respond to the message right away and before I knew it, he was walking in the front door. The moment he walked in and he started bombarding me with the same excuses of being sarcastic and him having a “character defect.” I responded to him that that’s fine, but I don’t really think that he was trying to be funny and I have a different idea of sarcasm. Before I knew it he was in my face blocking my entrance to the house and started screaming with his finger pointed at me about 5 inches away from my face and started screaming that he was apologizing. 

I managed to get around him through the entry way. He then said I love your mom. After an awkward pause he then said I love your sister and you. I replied I don’t think you do but you don’t have to and that’s OK. He then snorted back “I hope you find happiness someday.” Insinuating this has something to do with whats going on in my life or my personality. 
I said “wow ok im done” and walked away. He then began to scream again that he apologized and that I just refuse to accept his apology. 

The rest of the evening I stayed in my room and he stayed away. My mom got home and ignored me and my attempts to speak with her. She called me at 9 PM and asked what I wanted and a very rude voice and then basically hung up on me when i said I wanted to talk to her so i can only imagine the story he told her.

162,1d8gaqo,AITA for charging more than 1/3 of the rent to both of my roommates? ,"I (18F) will leave my hometown this summer to go to university in another city.

When we were apartment hunting, my mother (48F) advised me to sign the lease and take 100% of the responsibility. That way, I could easily choose and switch roommates if ever had problems with them. I thought it was a good idea so that is what I did. I ended up renting a three-bedroom apartment for a ridiculously low price compared to the market.

My mother recently moved in with my stepfather so all of her old furniture will furnish the new place.

My mom recommended that I price the bedrooms higher than 33% of the rent as the apartment will be furnished by me. She was saying that I should list each at 45% of the rent so I could only pay 10% myself. I found it quite excessive so I ended up putting the rooms at 38% each, which means I am going to pay 22%.

I do not know anyone who is also going to my uni from my hometown, so I made a post on a fb group to find roommates. I was flooded with messages because even with the 38% everyone was shocked at how low the price was. The two roommates I found are thrilled to only pay such a small price for their apartment. They are also aware that I have full responsibility of the lease and they are subleasing from me.

I think I may be the asshole because I have not told the two roommates that they are not paying 5% more than the third of the rent each. 

TDLR; I may be the asshole after having listened to my mom’s advice by upping the prices of my apartment’s bedrooms and justifying it with all the furniture and the responsibility of the lease being mine.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-05,"AITA for charging more than 1/3 of the rent to both of my roommates?

163,1d8g9zy,AITA for being not wanting my boyfriends little brother around all the time.,"For context: My boyfriend and I have been dating a little over a year. He did tell me he was extremely close with his family but I did not assume this much so.

He has a 15 year old brother, so I know has learning disabilities and autism but not severe. But learning wise maybe 6th grade level. You can’t really tell anything is off until your around him a bit.

The problem is he is over our house every weekend, this wouldn’t be a problem but he is incredibly clingy to the point it gives me anxiety. Everywhere I go he is right there, if I just want to run a quick errand he begs to come. I’m making a cake he’s watching me. I literally went to check mail and when I turned around he was behind me.

If I don’t respond right away to text he will non stop text me. 

I feel bad because he’s an extremely nice and thoughtful. Example I casually mentioned I wish I had regular water instead of sparkling and when he and bf came from store he gave me regular water, remembering all the way from the morning.

I have mentioned gently about needing space and him following me and he seemed hurt and stopped for a while but I don’t think he can help it. I also feel bad because his mom said he was talking about how much he likes me and how much fun we have. 

Summer is coming up and I’m getting so anxious because he is pretty much planning to spend the whole summer with us. I told my boyfriend I don’t think I could do it and he got upset. Saying that his brother doesn’t do anything but sit with us, and I wasn’t being sympathetic to his autism. That he doesn’t understand social cues. He said I’m an AH for not understanding.

164,1d8g9kr,WIBTA for unsubscribing my partner from a marketing email,"My partner of 23 years struggled with substance abuse for most of our relationship. At the heyday it was hard drugs, and eventually was ""only"" alcohol. They had tried to go sober many times and fell down again just as many. We struggled, they spent so much of our money, the vast majority I would say -- We did manage to pay the bills though, usually.

In 2021 we were both involved in a really major car accident that left them unable to work for 6 months, and I am left permanently unable to work. While we were both collecting unemployment benefits following the accident, they were still drinking. But after the benefits stopped and they had to return to work we really couldn't afford it anymore. They quit drinking! They've been sober for more than 2 years at this point! This is the longest they have ever been sober. It is entirely because we don't have any money, not because they necessarily wanted to, but they are happier and healthier even if they don't recognize it. I will accept any reason for their sobriety at all.

The lawyers were saying that we should have the settlement here in the next couple of months, I'm not sure what that would amount to though.  However I am concerned that the influx of cash will be too tempting and even so, we still really couldn't afford them drinking again.

They mentioned off hand that the local brewpub had released their summer beers and was having the local favourite chip wagon around outside on the weekends or whatever. Turns out they still receive promotional emails from the brewpub. Honestly the temptation is already great enough without them getting ads about it and I would really like to just go into their email to unsubscribe. They likely wouldn't notice, not for a long while anyway.

I know this would be an invasion of privacy and probably also crossing other lines as well, I don't even know if it would make a difference but WIBTA to just unsubscribe them from the local brewpubs?

165,1d8g943,AITA for setting boundaries with my MIL?,"I 19F have a 2yo (3 in July) daughter (Katie) with my boyfriend Brayden 19M. We live with his mom Catherine. She is like a mother to me too. When my own parents kicked me out she took me in. I am sooooo grateful for everything she's done for me, but lately she's been crossing boundaries. I understand I live in her house but I don't think that gives her the right to dictate how I parent my own kid. This hasn't been a problem until recently

I finished my first year of college about a month ago and am taking the summer off for some much needed bonding time. Cat works from home so she was watching Katie for me during the day. But now that I'm home for the summer and taking a more active role, she's unwilling to back off and let me be a parent. 

Katie doesn't listen to me very well because well toddlers don't listen great. Sometimes I have to raise my voice a bit to get her to listen. Whenever I do this, she IMMEDIATELY takes over. 

Two mornings ago Katie threw her juice cup on the floor and got juice all over everything, including me. I raised my voice a tiny bit and Granny immediately scoops her out of the chair while I'm still talking and suggests I go shower while they clean up. Yesterday the three of us were on an errand day and Katie was starting to get overwhelmed near the end of grocery shopping and started screaming in the aisle. Again, I started raising my voice and Granny scoops her up while she's still screaming to try and calm her down, which made me look like the bad guy. Then she wanted to get McDonald's for dinner. I said Katie shouldn't get a reward for throwing a tantrum, and she agreed to not get McDonald's but only if I cook dinner. I didn't have anything planned so of course we ended up doing it her way. Again, I look like the bad guy. 

I tried to talk to her last night. Said she's undermining me when she does this and to please stop. She said it's hard to take the backseat and I should try to be more understanding for her. She also said she's done a good job backing off and will keep giving me “as much space as possible” and insists she's not doing anything wrong and will keep interfering only when I'm “clearly getting overwhelmed”, which stung.

She tried to backtrack - said I was doing a very good job, and I'll “get there”. Said she's proud of me and all that but it's clear she thinks she's better than me. Later when I asked Brayden to talk to her about it he took her side. Said I should be happy we have her and to just let her help. This started a fight with me and him because he should be taking my side. He doesn't know what it's like for me because he's gone all day. I said to stop being a momma's boy and stand up for me. He told me I was being childish and ungrateful. 

I was fully planning on continuing to stick up for myself. I'm not being abusive or anything so I don't understand her need to interfere but now I don't have any backup and I'm not so sure anymore.

There’s little to no contact with his ex wife so he’s been doing it completely in his own since she was like 3. He’s done an amazing job and Daisy is an absolutely fantastic person.

Without knowing many details, Joel has some crazy project going on at work until July where he’s there for like 12 hours a day 5 or 6 days a week. He’s expressed that days are running together and he doesn’t even realize when weeks have passed.

Almost two weeks ago was Daisy’s birthday. Joel forgot. He had reminders and post it’s about everything he wanted to do and needed to remember but everything got buried under everything else and the day just approached faster than he anticipated. My understanding is that he remembered on the way home and just ended up getting a store bought cake and giving her cash. He told her he’d take her to the mall that Saturday so they can spend the day together and he’d spoil her, but he got called into work so he canceled that too. That Sunday we were supposed to have a little family party for her birthday. Joel had already started making arrangements to make up for it. When the day came she refused to come so it got canceled.

The next weekend (this last weekend) we were all getting together again, just because we like to get together as a family a lot. Joel showed up late and without Daisy.

They said ok.

The details are the character’s expression, hair length, and I adjusted the shoulder

In hindsight, I should have out right ask them if I can draw on top of the sketch…..

So I sent them the version that I drew on top. And now I’m feeling wrong. They haven’t reply to me. I’m worried that I may have offended them.

171,1d8forv,AITA for telling friends and family that my daughter failed college classes this year.,"I have a daughter (20F) who is in college. We are very proud of her and she got admitted to one of the best schools and is doing a joint computer science and mathematics major. Our extended family on both my and my wife's side is very career driven and the family is full of doctors, engineers, lawyers and professors. We are Korean American and do value things like a good education and career.

My daughter had a 3.9 GPA before this year but then the past 2 semesters this year she failed a bunch of courses and her GPA dropped. She will have to retake a lot of classes and will need a year extra to graduate now. Until now she refuses to take full responsibility for slacking and blames the fact that she had just moved in with her boyfriend (now ex) and says he was a slob and made her clean after him and that he kept disturbing her all the time (yet she went along with it and did not refuse). We have all been feeling bad about this as she was hoping to get into research and pursue a phd which might be hard now. She likes research and even has published work and work pending publication from working with some of her professors.

She never told me I was supposed to lie and hide her failures and I have been mentioning that she failed to friends and family sometimes. Not in a bad way or to make fun of her. I don't see what is there to hide as they will figure it out when she takes longer to graduate anyway.

Recently we had a large family diner and I was talking about it and my brother in law who is a researcher at a large tech company commented further just saying that realistically it would be almost impossible for her to get into top graduate programs now and that she should think of alternatives as she might not even get a job in the current market. My daughter ran to her room and cried and then came back later. 

After they left she did not tell me anything. However now apparently she heard from a cousin who she is close with that some family members feel bad for her while others are gloating and making fun of her because their kids / themselves will be more successful than her.

She then only now told me that I should not have told anyone despite her never telling me I should have hidden it. AITA here? I did not know I was not supposed to. Honestly I don't see why she should really care what others think and even if she does it would just help her not make the same mistake again.",Asshole,2024-06-05,"AITA for telling friends and family that my daughter failed college classes this year.

172,1d8fj1v,AITA for suggesting my bf should go back to his old workplace?,"My boyfriend (27M) has been fired from three corporate jobs and had his contract not extended at another job, all within a span of two years, never lasting more than six months at each. The longest he worked anywhere was about two years at his first corporate job.

He has been struggling to find and keep a job, so I (23F) suggested he reach out to his uncle, who still works at the company where he had his first corporate role, to see if he could get rehired. I thought staying there for at least a year would help him show on his resume that he can hold down a job for longer than six months. However, this conversation did not go well; he became defensive and aggressive, claiming that I was trying to do him unnecessary favors and that going back to his first job would ruin his career as it would undo all the progress his made. This led to an argument, and he told me to leave the house. When I disagreed and suggested we take some time to cool down and revisit the discussion later, he stormed out of the house.

While I understand he would be taking a considerable pay cut and the role is less prestigious than his previous ones, I am worried that potential employers see his job history unfavorably, despite him being charismatic and well-spoken in interviews. This concern was confirmed when a recent job offer was rescinded due to his job history.

Okay so my sister lately has been saying thst her list of responsibilities is unfair to her and that no one but her cleans which is untrue, I will sometimes step in and clean the kitchen now and then and usually I am the one making them both dinner.
My mom is tired, she is a single parent who works a full time job, and we're still barely getting by. 
I have a full time job and I'm in school so I am literally only here to sleep basically and sometimes I'm around in the morning times. 
My sister does not have a job, and it is summer so she is not in school, she has quite literally all day at home as she is in no extracurriculars or summer sports or anything like that. She has quite literally nothing on her plate but this.
So the way this started was, 1 year ago my sister wanted a really expensive phone, so she begged my mom for it, saying she would take on all the household chores until it was Paid off as her allowance. Mom reluctantly agreed.

My sister's responsibilities are as follows:

Keep her room tidy
Keep the kitchen clean
Keep the refrigerator clean
Do the dishes.
Keep the living room clean
Do her own laundry. 

Some pretty basic stuff in my eyes as I had to do the same at that age. Anyway now that it's summer she I'd saying it's unfair she has so much to do. I told her Mom is old and too tired to do most of this stuff, and I am literally never home to make the mess. Plus it's a responsibility she agreed to. I wouldn't mind taking on some of it if She did literally any of it. But she never does. She literally just does nothing all day. Atia?

174,1d8f848,AITA to ask my parents to cancel their party?,"
Hello, feeling crappy about this and need some advice.
I live overseas from my family and currently visiting for the first time in 10 years. 
We're spending two weeks with my husbands family and two with mine.

Due to my siblings work I will only see them on  two weekends. On one of the two Saturdays my mum has planned a party. I asked who was coming and she named her and my dads friends and an aunty. Approx 16 people. 
 haven't spoken to any of them in at least 10 years and had minimal interaction with them when I lived in the country. 

AITA to ask my parents to cancel the party so we can do something as an immediate family instead? 

 I have four days in 10 years to spend with my siblings/parents/husband together, I very much don't want to spend that time with essentially strangers. When testing the water about cancelling my Dad said ""it's people who care about you"".
