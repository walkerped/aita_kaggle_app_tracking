0,1d8rfzr,AITA for not declining or signing over my portion of my ex bfs life insurance payout too his mom? ,"I recently learnt that my ex bf passed away of cancer in March, his mom called me last week to inform me of his passing and to inform me that myself and her are listed as beneficiaries on his life insurance from his employer. She instantly tells me that she doesn't know why he never changed it but I can decline or sign the cheque over to her once I receive it.. 
Instantly I am in shock, he's gone? And he left me on there? Why? 
I went back and forth wondering if this was on purpose or accidental.. it had been years, approximately 6 since we mutually civily split up. 
I was informed he had a new gf that lived with him and she has 2 kids from a previous relationship that threw a wrench into things more.. is there a reason she never got put on it? Was this all just a big mistake?

Today it has been 1 week and this has been very hard especially since his mom has been terrorizing me all week trying to get me to agree to give her this money. She has said the most hurtful things, and has sent me the most disrespectful photos and video of her son in his last moments..
As of right now I haven't even gotten in touch with the insurance company, I have no idea how much this is or if I need a lawyers help at this point. 

Well today is the day I woke up knowing 100% I am keeping this money and I am not going to feel bad at all for helping my family with a gift my ex left for me. Unfortunately part of me still wonders if it's the right thing to do by my ex.. and if these were his wishes in the end.

A little info too add, my home burnt too the ground 3 years ago July 20th and October 1st 2 years ago my mom passed from cancer as well... it has been a long hard few years and this money would literally buy myself a new bra for the first time in 3 years.. my little clan could really use this money and I think my ex knew that..

1,1d8jyv2,AITA in trying to set this boundary with my coworker?,"I (MtF 24) work at a supermarket. There's one guy in particular who is a bit of a jokester, seems to like messing with people. He's probably about 60 or so.

Last shift I felt him pull on my hair. He's done this before, while comparing me to Samson from the Bible. I didn't say anything at the time, just let it go because he's old and a bit weird. I have kind of a thing about people touching my hair though, and especially someone I barely know, it's just weird and uncomfortable to me, not to mention he pulled hard enough for it to hurt.

So I asked him politely not to do it anymore. I don't mind him messing with me in other ways, I explained, just not touching my hair. He instantly started mocking me, saying things to the effect of ""ooooohh I'm a woman, don't touch my hair"". Again, I decided it wasn't worth it and let it go.

Then about 30 minutes later he comes up to me and starts arguing with me that he didn't pull my hair. I tell him he did, because I felt it, but he explains no, he actually flicked my head with his finger. Now I can see this, I think what happened is he flicked my head and his finger caught in my hair, it's quite thick and I wear my hair in a pretty tight ponytail. 

So I tell him I believe him, and to let me explain. He interrupts me multiple times, telling me emphatically that he didn't pull on my hair. I put my earbuds back in and bring it to my manager when I get a chance. She then talked to his manager.

2,1d8js8v,AITA for refusing to show up to a family pride event after my identity was belittled?,"I (17 y/o masc presenting) came out to my parents last year on June 1st during a family pride event. My brother (22 y/o trans male) had come out to my parents as trans and received overwhelming support from my parents and family as whole.

For reference I identify as Panromantic, Asexaul, and Agender. My brother got top surgery and it had healed about a month before Pride Month of last year and so my parents decided to hold what they called a 'Pride Picnic' for the family to celebrate him. I talked to him about how I was scared to come out and he suggested doing it during the picnic so I did. I was met with massive backlash, my parents that I ""hadn't met the right person"" and ""was just a confused Pansexual"" and it really hurt me. What hurt more was that a lot of family including my parents ganged up on me, claiming that I was ruining my brothers big day.

Because my high school is not close to my house I've been living with my friend with almost no contact with my parents. Out of the blue I got a text from them three days ago as of writing this post saying that, and I quote, I was ""welcome to join the family for this years 'Pride Picinc' if I admitted my parents were right about my identity"". I refused and said I would not be doing anything with them if they're support was subjective.

Now I'm getting messages from a lot of family claiming that it was cruel of me to accuse my parents of being homophobic and unsupportive after everything they did for my brother. Claiming my parents want the best for me and it was wrong of me to suggest otherwise.

I didn't think I was in the wrong but after all the messages I'm not sure. So Reddit, AITA?

4,1d8f3l5,AITA for calling out my husband for texting with my sister?,"For context: I 30F and my husband 32M have been together 10 years. I have a big family, 6 sisters we are all extremely close. We all have children and my nieces and nephews come over a lot.

My sisters are all single mothers, every once and a while we babysit for them. Or I may ask my husband to babysit for us to go eat or something.

I’ve always been okay with this but there is some situations I don’t like. One of my sisters would just text me husband and side step me, ask for his help moving, ask if he had extra phone. I told him I don’t find that appropriate and if she needs help she should contact me. 

So the new situation is, she texted my husband saying that she lost her babysitter and could he behind watching her kid while she worked 9-5 until she could find a babysitter or daycare.

Reasons I find this strange, although my husband works from home still works. She didn’t ask me, I also work from home but go in office for a few days. Now he did tell me, and I told him reply sorry, I work so I wouldn’t be able to. And I’d later talk to her.

Instead he replied, I work and travel so I may not be reliable but I can Friday. And it just would depend on the day. 

I told him that was extremely disrespectful and inappropriate. One because he made that decision without me, knowing I’d be here if he babysit. He went against what I said. And it opens the door for him to continue contact of her asking if he can babysit. He claims he was trying to be nice and I should be mad at my sister. And I’m an AH for being upset he was being nice. 

I think it was highly inappropriate so AITA?

5,1d8f0sj,AITA for Dancing with another woman while on a date with my girlfriend ,"My girlfriend 25 year old woman asked me 24 year old man to post on here for anonymous opinions.

Something to know about me is I am an extrovert. I love going out and making friends. My favorite place to go is a cool bar in my town that has live music and swing dancing on the weekends. Before I started dating my girlfriend I would go there every week. My girlfriend is not an extrovert and that doesn't bother me. I enjoy her company and I don't mind staying at home if I'm with her. This last weekend I was feeling a little antsy so I asked my girlfriend if she wouldn't mind going out because I wanted to share my favorite place with her. When we got there I tried leading her to the dance floor but she did not want to go because she said she was embarrassed to dance in front of people. I tried to reassure her no one would be watching and if she was embarrassed because she did not know how to dance I would teach her. She still did not want to so we found a table and ordered some food and drinks.

We were having a good time having dinner together when a song I really liked to dance to started playing. I told my girlfriend ""This song is super fun to dance to. Do you want to dance with me?"" she said no. So I asked ""Do you mind if I go dance then?"". She said sure. I walked out to the dance floor and saw a woman standing on the side watching her friends dance. I walked over to her reached out my hand and asked if she wanted to dance. She accepted by taking my hand and I lead her out to the dance floor. She was a good dancer so we had a fun time. We were both laughing and smiling. After the song was over I thanked her for the dance and lead her back to her friends (a guy and a girl). I had a little small talk with them for about a minute before I thanked the woman again for the dance and returned to my girlfriend.

After a little bit of time passed and we had finished our meals the woman I had danced with came up to our table. She handed me a slip of paper. I was confused why she handed me something so on instinct I said ""Thank you"". The woman then returned to her friends who were standing a few feet back looking like they where about to leave. I said to all three of them. ""Nice to meet you guys"" and waved goodbye. The girl who was the friend of the girl I danced with said ""you to, maybe we will see you here again"" and they left. I turned back to my girlfriend who was scowling at me. She got up and left the bar. I went to the bar and paid the bill and followed after her. Because I stayed and paid the bill my girlfriend was already in the car.

When I got in the car we started arguing. She said I should not have danced with the girl because she was clearly flirting with me and she did not like how she took my hand. I told her grabbing hands is the way people do it because it would be weird to ask someone to dance and then walk away expecting them to follow. She then said ""I did not know you were going to ask another girl to dance or I would not have let you"". I told her I asked her to dance first and she would not. I wanted to dance thats why we came to this place in the first place. She then accused me of flirting back to her because we were laughing and keeping eye contact and if I really was not flirting I would not have accepted her phone number. I told her I did not know it was her phone number because she caught me off guard and I was not going to rip it up in front of her. She then said ""If you cared about my feelings you would have ripped it up"". I told her I don't think talking to women is something I should not be allowed to do and It is not my fault she gave me her phone number.

We never had issues before or judged neighbor. Extremely friendly with her and cordial almost close with her. Neighbor has always asked for a million favors since we moved in and became friendly with her, since I am a sahm I never minded, walking her dog, helping her through two surgeries, barrowing groceries, etc. She's crossed boundaries even asking to barrow a bottle of wine because she's been so desperate for a drink, etc. 

Neighbor parent support her financially and she has been through her second creepy unemployed boyfriend, and now recently started dating a new man who she moved in after 2 months of knowing, the guy drives her car around, doesn't go to work, stands outside her house sometimes, just acts and gives myself and the other neighbors the creeps. 

I have a large dog, our complex rules are to always have the dogs on leash, my neighbor has always opened her front door let her small dog out to pee off leash in front lawn and then calls her back inside, unfortunately said little shit dog will not listen and charge at anything she sees, lazy drunk neighbor will not chase after her but will just call her. This happened about 10 times while I am walking my dog now heavily pregnant daily at night since my husbands work hours, my dog would not do anything but I am afraid of her dog scaring mine and me getting hurt between the two because it's happened before and I pull my dog back and run away. 

After the 10th time I said to her ""put your dog on a leash, everyone else does it, I'm 8 months pregnant and don't want to get hurt"" I assume neighbor had been drinking like she does every night, she called me and cursed me out, told me to keep my toddler away from her front lawn which was irrelevant and that I am a rude, nasty person, bitch, etc out of nowhere.

7,1d8e6n2,AITA for not accepting my parents' pool?,"Last summer my parents put in a pool in our backyard, but the thing is its an above ground pool. Ive never really thought fondly of those.

I joined my school a few years ago and wasn't popular, however over this past year ive been talking to a lot of people and hanging out with them. Just a few weeks ago I had an awesome birthday party and people loved it and had a great time. I always promise these people for the best experience possible when they hang out with me, so when my parents told me that they were putting in a pool I was super exited, however It is an above ground one witch kind of caught me off guard.

I'm not trying to sound spoiled im just trying to give my new friends the best possible time and make them want to come over again and I think building a deck around the pool would really help me in achieving that.

Just recently a girl in my class came up to me and asked whether it was above ground or inground, I doged the question immedetly. Over this passed week ive tried to convince my parents to put in a deck witch they said yes but its not a deck its more of a patio. Im honestly just considering inviting everybody to my grandmother's beach house instead. But the thing is I dont want to upset my parents, I just feel like if I go through with it and Invite people over they will not think its that good. I know that I sound extreamly entiteld but please look at it from my perspective. I live in a nice area, Ive never reallly been popular over the past few years and im finally sucseeding in school with other people/classmates only for this to happen, I dont know what to think, its alot of pressure when people ask about it.

8,1d8dyl5,AITA for being angry with my parents for letting my brother skip my graduation?,"I (17F) am graduating in 2 days. Yesterday my mom told me, very casually, that my brother (10) wont be at graduation. I was shocked and upset and I asked her why. She told me he has a baseball game and immediately I was hurt, not only because my brother is willing to skip an important day in my life for one baseball game, but because my parents were so quick to allow him to do that. I understand that a graduation wouldn’t be exciting for him, he’s 10 and I don’t expect him to enjoy sitting around for a few hours, but there’s a part of me that thought he would still want to come because we are close. I’m mostly upset with my parents allowing it, like I said, because that just feels ridiculous to me. If I were to miss my brothers graduation by choosing some other event to go to, everyone would be so angry with me. Not that I feel like they’re playing favorites, but I just don’t understand why they would let it slide like that. This is is the little league, it would be different if college scouts were going to be there. 

Anyways, my mom told me that she didn’t understand why I was so upset and I can just talk to my brother about it, so I asked him at dinner why he didn’t want to come. He just said sorry, so then I turned to my parents and told them I was mad they were letting him skip my graduation. They were surprised and told me it’s not fair for me to be upset with anyone after I made it seem like it wasn’t important for family to be there (because I told them I didn’t want my estranged father to come, my “parents” is referring to my mom and stepdad, as well as me not inviting my two great grandmothers, even though it wouldnt be a good environment for them because it’s extremely hot outside and the bleachers are extremely crowded and not convienient for elderly) and I never had an interest in sports or extracurriculars so I couldn’t understand why this was important enough for him to miss my graduation. They also said that it wasn’t like he was going to be gone all night and I could see him after

My brother started crying while I was fighting with my parents and I felt bad. I started to feel like the AH because this game is important to my brother and maybe I shouldn’t be so aggressive about him coming. I went upstairs after and my parents had sent my brother up to my room to apologize for him not coming.

I want to know if Im in the wrong because I can’t help but feel so sad that my only sibling isn’t going to be there for the only graduation Im going to have, and In eight years I’ll be going to his, and while I’ll be happy to celebrate him, I’ll remember he wasn’t there for mine.

10,1d8djk7,AITA for separating my chores from the rest of the family?,"I, 22M, live with my mother, her significant other, and my younger siblings. I have been trying to get my feet underneath me for a while now since I have finished college and moved back home last year (a full year home as of last month). My weekends and Wednesdays are the days I work. Unfortunately for me, I haven't been able to find a full time job since moving back.

Through the week, I typically spend that time playing games, and taking care of my siblings when they need something. However, I refuse to pick up after them.

Now, where does that all fall into the issue at hand you may ask? Let me tell you. I have taken a parent/guardian role for my younger siblings. This is not a new thing for me as I have changed their diapers and cooked for them all the time. For a little context, they are now 15 and 12. I was hoping that two years away from home would have matured them a bit to pick up after themselves, but it has gone way down hill.

My mother and her boyfriend have a bit of a hoarding issue. Doesn't help that the boyfriend has no job, not even part time, yet can't pick up after his own five year old. This all leads to basic chores not getting done around the house. That leads to me getting yelled at for not carrying my weight around the house.

I should clarify, I pay for my own bills. I even got a food stamp card and tossed it to my mother since she was having hard a hard time with how expensive food has been getting.

All of this led to me taking care of only my dirty laundry, my dirty dishes, mowing the lawn, and staying in my room to avoid seeing the other people in the house.

The dishes and messes around the house were only getting worse.

I had just finished mowing the lawn where I ran over a total of 6 pairs of socks that had been left outside and I went inside and got a little heated with my siblings about how I tell them to pick up their stuff outside. I tell them time and time again. So, like I said, I just ran them over. At least this time they didn't leave random gardening tools around. 

My mother decided to step in and yell at me about how I never do anything around the house. About how mowing the lawn includes picking up all the toys, socks, and other random things left outside.

I replied to all of her rant with, ""My dad would do the exact same thing I did. Yes, it sucked to not find the toy I loved. However, I knew it was my fault that they were gone in the first place. Why do you thing I pick up my shit now?""

This didn't help anything. It only fanned the flames. It was not the reaction I had anticipated.

It led to an even bigger rant about my dad not being that great of a dad.

Either way, I decided to bite my tongue and just went back to my room where I am typing this now.

So, am I the asshole? I know I am not innocent. I shouldn't have let my anger get to me. I think we are all assholes.

I am planning a wedding and it’s been last minute because of complications outside of our control that made planning impossible.

My husband’s sister said the date would not work for her so we cancelled. Unfortunately the venue is fully booked for September. So we talked about October.

November weather in my area is unpredictable and I would really like some nice photos in good weather. I already canceled an ideal date in September. Also my sister will have a lot of trouble making it for November because she is still a fellow in training so she lacks the flexibility that all other siblings have.

Am I being unreasonable for insisting on October? Should I be planning around her schedule?
