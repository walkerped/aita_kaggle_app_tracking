0,1d9j5i1,AITA for losing every ounce of respect for my mom - whom I still live with?,"Just to start it off - my Mom used to be very sweet, I mean it was me and her 24/7, we'd play dolls together when I was younger, we'd  always hang out just us two when my other siblings were at school, she'd always take me everywhere with her - we were inseparable. 

Until about 2021 when I came out as transgender, ftm, at that moment it felt like she lost every single interest in me. she didn't let me join in with things, she wouldn't add me in on photos, she'd never talk about me - I've had 2 birthdays where she's just done fuck all for it but for her daughters she does everything she possibly can for them.


She did this until up to 2024 this year when I began just not caring what she thought, I cut my hair frequently I bind my chest and I really do pass as a boy. But it's like she chooses to ignore it no matter what, she keeps blabbing on about how me being a 'girl' is the best thing ever, she talks about me as if I'm the girliest thing on earth - I literally wear suits frequently. That is not girly actives. 
This year I've grown just a little more alone and to myself rather than keep trying to go back to her in hopes she'll accept me, I did that for the last time last year - and I will never do it again. she just doesn't get it, I don't know why, I could spill my heart and entire thoughts out to that woman and she'd just pick the bits she wants to actually listen too. Thing is I'm also confused because at the same time she keeps trying to talk to me and hug me and it's as if she thinks doing that now is gonna change anything, but it won't. For the past few years I didnt think much of her behaviour - but this year its really come to me that she's am awful person, I keep thinking to myself why should I be nice to a woman who won't let me be myself? Who won't even let me talk or think? she doesnt even believe that my mental health issues are a problem (They are.) I stopped telling her things - one time she sat me down for 30 minutes asking me to open up and I just stared at her, because I know she wasn't gonna accept shit I say. I don't hug her i barely talk to her, I don't like her. I've lost genuinely every ounce of respect or love for her this year and I find it unbelievable and unfair that she'd just now trying to get me to open up - yet at the same time denying any of my feelings.
It just feels like she's trying to act like she hasn't done anything.



idk, am I the asshole? should I be talking about my own mother like this? she did raise me, no doubt she raised me good - like atleast up to age twelve, some people tell me that I'm right for thinking like this but others say it seems disrespectful and i just don't know how to respect someone's feelings when they won't respect my own.

1,1d97l03,AITA for using the couch my roommate sleeps on?,"My ex and I (both mid-20's) broke up about a month ago. It wasn't a big fight or anything, but they admitted that they haven't loved me for quite a while and we broke it off. Of course, I still loved them and wanted to be together... and given that it was my first break up, it was incredibly hard on me. It still kind of is, but things are getting easier by the day. 

Throught it all, I've been told by quite a few people that I'm doing better than they would have expected. I had my tough times, sure, but I never lashed out or anything similar. My goal has been to still be their friend.

Anyways, I got home from work last night pretty late. While my job isn't super hard, I do take quite a beating throughout the day. Got home, took a shower, and went downstairs to make nuggets. I didn't want to go back upstairs while they were cooking because I usually can't hear the beep from upstairs, so I sat on the couch. 

For context, the two of us still live together. Our lease renewed in May and it's for a year. Yes, they signed the renewal knowing they didnt love me, but thats not the point. 

We split everything evenly for the most part, though I bought the vast majority of the furniture. The only exception is the mattress, which we went half in on. When we split, we were both sleeping in the bed for a while before they decided to start sleeping on the couch. I bought the couch so I offered to switch off every couple of nights or every week so they could sleep on an actual mattress, to which they said no. I keep offering though.

Anyways, I bought the couch, but they're sleeping on it. I figured it would be fine for me to lay down on the couch while I was waiting on my nuggs to cook. I moved their pillow and used my own, pushed their blanket back, and layed down on the couch. My feet were partway underneath their blanket, but it was my own pillow.

At this point, my ex got home. I greeted them normally only to be met with a sigh and them asking what I was doing. I responded that I was waiting for my food to cook, they asked why I was on their bed, and I kind of stammered out an apology before getting up. 

Without warning, they went around the house collecting all of their things and moving them down to the basement. I'm skipping over some things, but they basically said I crossed a line. They were incredibly angry and I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that what I had done was invading personal space or crossing a boundary. The couch is in the living room after all.

They said I can have my couch back and that's all they said. I just feel like a complete asshole due to them feeling like they need to sleep in the basement, but I also don't feel like I did anything wrong in this situation. Sure, they're sleeping there, but I was just laying down for a few minutes. 

I've already apologized so many times for encroaching on their space and I've promised it wouldn't happen again but it seems fruitless.

2,1d97gak,AITA for telling my 17 year old daughter not to throw tantrums while I'm working.,"My 17 year old had final exams today. She didnt get as high of a grade as she wanted. It was a C. She came home  literally crying and screaming about it while I (43f) was working up in my home office. My job requires a lot of video calls with other leaders in my organization, which is exactly what was happening when she came in the door. I had to mute myself so the background noise didn't carry  and couldn't participate in my meeting. I didn't react angrily toward her, but later I made a semi passive aggressive remark about it... something to the effect of, ""yeah I love it when you come home screaming when I'm on a work call."" She launched a verbal attack about how she cant help it that she is depressed and how could I possibly be angry and  said that I am horrible to her and don't care about her. I replied that she is allowed to be sad about a bad grade, but it doesnt warrant screaming and crying when she knows I am working. It's ok to be sad, but there is a time, place and way of expressing it that won't cause me problems at work, which is important because that is what keeps a roof over our head and food on the table. So, Reddit, should I be more sensitive to her emotional state or was I perfectly justified in my reaction? I really want to know so I can either work on myself as a parent or show her the opposite viewpoints posted here.  She is now demanding that I apologize to her, but I think I was being reasonable because at 17 she needs to grow up a bit to prepare to function in the real world, where that behavior won't be tolerated. I think she owes me an apology.

Update: I appreciate all your comments about how she may be experiencing an issue with her mental health. You're exactly right!! I should have mentioned a few things. 

1. We've had this conversation before about the importance of quiet, so yes I have spoken to her about this maturally as a good parent. I also didn't make this remark in the moment, but later when she was calm. And that was after I had given her a hug and talked about it. The remark I made was probably not kind, but was intended as a roundabout sort of reminder that her tantrums have consequences. 

2. Yes she does struggle with anxiety and depression and has been since she was little, but she has been in therapy that whole time and sees a psychiatrist. I have actively tried to help her for the last 14 years or so, and have been empathetic and patient. Also, this is not something she waits for home to let out. This is a deeper emotional regulation problem I think. I actually am super empathetic to ND and MH, but I cant help but wonder if she sometimes uses this as a crutch. Before you berate me for that statement, there has been a very fine line we have been dancing around between things that are out of her control and things that she just won't work on because she won't take responsibility and just blames Mental Health. So for example , refusing to work on things and therapy and instead just saying that she can't help it. Because I don't always know where that line is, I usually err on the side of it not being in her control. However, I do worry that in doing so I am not helping her emotionally regulate. It's just me and my daughter with no one to help guide me as a parent, so I definitely don't pretend to get it right all the time. That is why I appreciate your perspectives so much.

3. I've always tried to correct this behavior. One problem is the coparent I had working against me for so long, who did allow this behavior at his house and undermined me and put me down to my daughter. My daughter is now actually very aware that his behavior was unacceptable and acknowledges how hard I have tried to be a good parent all these years. Coparent passed away like 6 years ago and still trying to undo the damage, but again.... she is in therapy and sees a psychiatrist.

4. It's not just muting a meeting. I was expected to be speaking. 

5. This kid is smart and this was one grade, and overall her GPA is over 3.8 and she is going to a local state school, so this one grade is not going to ruin anything for her. Additionally, I later found out this was a weighted grade that equated to a B.

6. She is always loud. She sings, she talks to herself, she sometimes sort of screams for the smallest reasons. (I found something I was looking for! I just remembered my friend is coming over! I like chocolate!) This part is not a disorder, it's her personality. I've asked her nicely to keep it down many times before! Not all the time, just for a short while between getting home from school and when I am done working. I don't mind all weekend ir in the evening. I apologize that I referred to this as MCS. Poor choice of words. Was just trying to describe the way she feels like she is starring in a show and doesn't necessarily realize how loud she is being or how other people are reacting to the behavior. She would agree with this, as we've talked about it before. She is just very theatrical. 

7. Yes, I could go into the office. It's a 40 minute commute each way, so with gas, mileage and wear and tear, I just try to avoid it. I guess I feel like she isnt a little kid anyone and should be able to emotionally regulate more than she does. 

8. Despite all this info, yes a passive aggressive remark isn't the way to go. I hear you on that one! And I truly do appreciate all your opposing perspectives. They do help me take a step back and reassess the situation. Many people mentioned autism. I thought this might be the case when she was as young as 3 but was assured her symptoms didn't look like autism. Sounds like maybe I need to revisit that with her doctor. Current diagnosis is depression, anxiety, ADHD and borderline personality disorder.  She isnt taking ADHD meds at the moment. Stimulants were not good for her, so we're trying Prozac and a mood stabilizer and something for anxiety she can take as needed. I am very involved in her mental health challenges. We've been trying to figure this out for years. She is doing DBT and has done CBT.

4,1d95t1m,AITA for not going to my little cousin's birthday party? ,"I have a cluster of family members (aunts/uncles/cousins/grandmother) who live in Georgia (state). I haven't seen most of them in years, the last time being back when I drove through the area during a move to Florida for my then-spouse's job in 2015. None of them came to visit us despite an open invitation in all of time since then, which I get... my cousins have kids, jobs, there was a pandemic, and I honestly do not hold it against them but it absolutely takes center stage in my thoughts with what follows. 

My then-spouse and I have since concluded an extremely contentious divorce, and I am remarried with a 5-month-old in addition to my two children from the previous relationship. Since my eldest two hadn't seen their relatives since they were very young and my extended family hasn't yet met my spouse or our baby, I began talking in April to my mom (who lives in Texas but has visited GA almost annually) along with one of my cousins (Thea) in GA about planning a trip during the summer and settle on mid-July after getting no specific feedbac,since that is when a major home improvement project will be paid off and allow us to be more comfortable traveling financially. We provided dates, spouse put vacation days in, and we booked accommodations. 

Then Thea tells me in May that it would actually be better if we came in June because my other cousin, Isla (Thea's sister) throws a birthday party for her son that tends to double as a family reunion. Isla sends me an evite, which I text her about letting her know we unfortunately can't make it due to financial constraints and previous reservations, but I hope to see her when we are there. She responded friendly and with happy emojis, so it seemed fine. 

Thea has also indicated she understands we can only go on the dates provided, but then days ago her mother had her ask me if ""we are sure we don't want to go to the birthday party."" My own mother told me yesterday to ""just think about"" making a separate trip up at the end of June by myself, since my spouse has the vacation days set already. Dearest redditors, it is an 8-hour drive not including any stops... with a 12-year-old, 10-year-old, and a 5-month-old.

I don't THINK IATA for refusing to do this, but given that it keeps. Coming. Up. I would like outside perspective.

6,1d94wam,WIBTA for not joining my (F23) girlfriend (F26) in her family dinners?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. My girlfriend's mom has been hosting family dinners for about a year now and typically consists of her mom, her brother and his girlfriend, my girlfriend, and me. 

Her family likes me, but holds views that I ultimately feel go against me and my girlfriend. Talking points for dinner are generally homophobic, misogynistic, racist, classist, full of conspiracy theories, and so on. It's uncomfortable for me almost every time I go, and it's very rare we have dinners where these ideas don't come up. My girlfriend will speak up most times, but then it just becomes her family throwing insults and being degrading. I don't feel it's my place to voice my opinions in these dinners since I am just the girlfriend, but I have done so at times in the past. However, last time I did, her mother insulted me and and my family, and specifically my mother, and I walked out because of her rudeness. 

The dinners are frustrating and it's exhausting to hear opinions that devalue my own and other people's worth and not being able to say anything. Her mother has also made false accusations about me behind my back to my girlfriend, which then makes it hard to face her at dinner with a smile on my face.  

I've expressed to my girlfriend that these dinners make me uncomfortable and I am not sure if I want to go anymore. She said it makes her sad that I won't go and she wishes I could go. I said maybe I could just make my attendance less frequent, but that also seems to have made her sad. She says that they don't do it as much when I'm there, which is true, but when I'm not there they all just dogpile on my girlfriend x 100. She'll tell me about them the next day and I feel guilty for not being there. I feel like not going is not being supportive of my girlfriend, while going feels like I'm not supporting myself, and I don't know what to do. I feel like an asshole for not standing up for myself and my girlfriend while I'm there, but also an asshole for not going at all.

Me (M37) and one of my closest friends since kids (M37) got into an argument over something by so silly. Be prepared cause this is a silly argument that led into personal things being said. 

I was telling him about this girl I met last year who gave me her social media when we met but happened to be a sex worker. She never told me that but it was all over her page. We never actually hung out but talked from time to time. She hit me up a few weeks ago asking how I been and stuff. I told my friend about her hitting me up. I also told him I went on her social media and see she no longer a sex worker and totally against it. 

He starts saying you desperate man why you going on her page. I told him that me and her are already friends on social media. He says again so what you desperate and that’s when I lost it telling him I had better women then him in our lifetime. We argued about women which lead to a money argument with him saying he got more money than me and I got nothing he want

It then lead to him insulting my girlfriend mental health condition. She is bipolar. He insulted another condition of hers as well. I then said instead of you gambling so much and taking trips to Las Vegas you need to spend that money on your kids and all your baby mamas. I also said different men are with your baby mamas raising  your kids.

I hung up after that. A few days later he sent a long text basically saying he not getting over this argument because I brought his kids into it and that he’s not going to fight me only cause he knows my family. We argued back and forth but haven’t spoke since. 

Trying to figure out how to go about this and who was wrong here. Apart of me feels bad what I said about the kids stuff. Apart of me is also upset what he said about my girlfriend

This man and I have been no contact because he was absolutely destroying my mental health, and I’ve been thriving without him so much more. He would barely even let me leave the house when we were together even though he lives 6 hours away. He still makes frequent attempts to contact me, and for a while I stupidly would answer for conversation.

Yesterday while I was at work I received a call from him, but I was working and it was busy so I just let it go to voicemail. I then get a bunch of texts begging me to call him because it’s an emergency, and I tell him to text me what’s wrong as I’m not going to answer my phone unless it’s a dire situation. He refuses, but texts me asking if I can leave work early, and becomes furious when I say no.

He proceeds to ask for money, and once again got mad when I said I was not helping him with money until I saw at least some of that money he owed me. For context I had agreed to let him only pay me back $400 as it basically covered my college deposit and he refused after promising me he would all because I had referred to the man my best friend has been talking to as her boyfriend when they hadn’t made it official and that made me a liar. I wish I was joking about that whole thing.

He ends up calling me after I get off work, and at this point I’m with my best friend. He proceeds to start insulting me and calling me names all because I’m hanging out with her, and he thinks that all her and I do is sleep around with guys. I block him and turn off no caller id calls because I wanted to have a nice day.

I check my voicemail when I return home and learn the emergency was that his dad died. I was a bit of a dick and left him a voicemail back letting him know I did not want to talk, I would not be helping him financially, that he should consider free counseling instead of blowing up his ex he supposedly hates, and that frankly the events were karma because last time he tried making me feel this small and worthless he had to give up his cat. I know I’m probably in the wrong for saying that.

He left a voicemail today cussing me out and saying he needed 50 dollars to help his younger sister (F17) that lived with their dad. At the end of the voice mail he revealed that pretty much that 50 wasn’t for her but for him to buy smokes and have “just in case money”

12,1d9v5av,AITA for looking up my martial arts instructor's public information,"I  joined a martial arts class a few months ago. In a moment of poor judgment, I looked up my instructor's public real estate and court records( it was all public like via google search, I didn't pay any site to do a background check or anything like that just googling) to learn more about him, then casually mentioned it to him after class in the presence of a few other students. He participated in the conversation and never said, ""Hey, let's not talk about this."" After the talk, he reacted strongly, expressing severe discomfort and concern about my actions.

Later that night, I apologized profusely via text, expressing remorse and a willingness to do whatever it takes to rebuild trust. I went to class on Tuesday, where he approached me to say he didn't think he could instruct me anymore(i.e Ban me so I couldn't take any class there). We had a good conversation, discussing my intentions and his past experiences with stalking, which triggered his reaction. I apologized again, explained my admiration for him, and asked for a second chance, emphasizing my good standing as a student until this incident.

He agreed to reconsider and said he'd call me in a couple of days after discussing it with his team. I sent a brief message on Wednesday thanking him for the conversation. He replied with thanks for the conversation as well, but I still haven't received a call. It's now Thursday.

Additional details:

* My instructor has a history of being stalked.(I didn't know this beforehand)
* During our initial conversation, he voluntarily shared information about a past charge.
* I expressed my admiration for him and my desire to learn from him as a mentor.
* I've always been a respectful and well-liked student up until this incident.

Please note: I acknowledge my actions were inappropriate and am genuinely remorseful.

In a moment of poor judgment, I looked up my instructor's public real estate and court records( it was all public like via google search, I didn't pay any site to do a background check or anything like that just googling) to learn more about him, then casually mentioned it to him after class in the presence of a few other students. He participated in the conversation and never said, ""Hey, let's not talk about this."" After the talk, he reacted strongly, expressing severe discomfort and concern about my actions.

Later that night, I apologized profusely via text, expressing remorse and a willingness to do whatever it takes to rebuild trust. I went to class on Tuesday, where he approached me to say he didn't think he could instruct me anymore(i.e Ban me so I couldn't take any class there). We had a good conversation, discussing my intentions and his past experiences with stalking, which triggered his reaction. I apologized again, explained my admiration for him, and asked for a second chance, emphasizing my good standing as a student until this incident.

He agreed to reconsider and said he'd call me in a couple of days after discussing it with his team. I sent a brief message on Wednesday thanking him for the conversation. He replied with thanks for the conversation as well, but I still haven't received a call. It's now Thursday.

Additional details:

* My instructor has a history of being stalked.(I didn't know this beforehand)
* During our initial conversation, he voluntarily shared information about a past charge.
* I expressed my admiration for him and my desire to learn from him as a mentor.
* I've always been a respectful and well-liked student up until this incident.

Please note: I acknowledge my actions were inappropriate and am genuinely remorseful.

13,1d9v52x,WIBTA if I skip Eid the 3nd most and last festival of the year at my parent's ,"I M34  with possibly misdiagnosed Bipolar but definitely OCPD and anxiety am being divorced. I have had a very bad relationship with my brother 32M since childhood. Since I was diagnosed with anxiety, he has created or been reason for 4 of my anxiety triggers. His trophy wife created issues between my wife and my family before they even got married. My sis had gone to visit him (they live in different country) and his fights with his wife made her cut short her Vacation and come back sooner. Now she might have PTSD with that country and my brother. She has gone to my uncle's place in different country. She was to be back for Eid (2nd most important Muslim festival and last of the year) but convinced my parents to extend her stay so she can celebrate one with them (and avoid my bro and his wife).
I want to do that too, for 4 reasons, I resent and possibly hate my bro and his wife is a female dog and has stirred a lot of trouble for everyone.

They take up the entire 2nd bedroom and we (my aunt, my sis, my then wife) sleep in our dad's bedroom or in the living room. They don't even let the cat in, they don't even ask or adjust like a 3rd world family would do in small 2bedroom appartement. His triggering my anxiety at my worst stage resulted in my wrong diagnosis of Bipolar disorder and my wife leaving me. Him triggering me multiple times at my worse stages of life, increased my anxieties,  sort of created a butterfly effect resulting in my wife divorcing me. Religiously we are divorced,  just that we need an official court order too. Also he is my dad's favorite.

Lastly I want to secure my mental health and move on from divorce. I have been staying with my parents because of the divorce, this is my ex and my main home town, but I stay in a city 4 hours away. I m going back this Saturday (IA) but I ll have to be back by 15th fo Eid. My parents also resent me a little because I don't ""try"" enough to change myself. The issue is like I said it is 2nd most important festival, the last of the year, it needs a lot of hardwork and prep work which I can't leave it to my dad (my bro loves eating meat but wouldn't touch raw meat). I know he wouldn't be of much help. I skipping this would hurt my parents a lot and increase rift between us siblings.

16,1d9ufao,WIBTA if I say anything to my possible future university classmate?,"I (22F) attend a Canadian uni. One of my requirements is an undergraduate research project course. The course had 80-100 ppl. I found it challenging as the research associate in my lab, Ralph, seemed to despise me for no reason. I will graduate next year due to me not taking a full course load this year for mental health reasons. 

In semester 2, there were these other courses (1. Enviro and \[area of study\] and 2. Special Topics in \[blank\]). I dropped the former but remained in the latter due to mental health. This girl, Gigi, was in both. Gigi was also in the research  project course, but working in a different lab for it.

I introduced myself to her in the former. Then, I decided to share why I was happy that day. Looking back, this was stupid of me because I barely knew her at the time but I was so excited that I just couldn't contain myself. I shared that I had been doing better than I expected in the research project course, as I had been getting 80% at the time (A- where I am from). She then went ""OOOH YOU HAVE THE WRONG SUPERVISOR! EVERYONE IN THAT CLASS IS GETTING 90'S!"" She had a huge smirk on her face and her tone of voice was like she had just discovered a juicy piece of hot celebrity gossip. I was caught off guard by this. I said nothing but gave her a look and turned away, ending the convo.

I have social anxiety. I've been suspected to also be autistic but was never diagnosed with it. This makes me wonder if I am being too sensitive.

 Despite us sharing the Special Topics course together, we barely interacted. The class was in groups, and we were in different groups. She did, however, repeat the thing about everyone having 90's to her friend in her group and seemed to look at me as she was saying it. She did also giggle as she was overhearing me discuss how excited I was for Easter break that year as my birthday would also be during break, so I would have my birthday off from school. 

The research project course ended in April and my mark was 83% or A-. The course average was A-. Only the letter grade is shown for the course average. I have no idea if Gigi is also planning on doing more courses next year. 

If I see her in my classes next year, I feel like saying ""IN UR FACE! U WERE WRONG! THE CLASS AVERAGE WAS A-, SO NO NOT EVERYONE WAS GETTING 90'S OR ELSE THE CLASS AVERAGE WOULD'VE BEEN HIGHER! IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WHY WERE THERE RUBRICS IN THE FIRST PLACE. KARMA'S A BITCH! MAYBE U WERE THE ONE WITH THE WRONG SUPERVISOR ALL ALONG! U WEREN'T THE TEACHER HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW EVERYONE'S GRADES!"" (something along the lines of that) if she says hi to me.

I'm 13 F. I am the only girl in my family (except my mum) and am the middle child with a younger brother 11 M and the oldest brother 25 M. I have started to realise that my younger brother is getting off with a lot more than I did when I was his age. Mum 44 F does most things for him like making breakfast, butter toast and much more. I have no idea why because my parents don't have favourites but I do not do so much anymore.

Anyway, I am sick of picking up after him when he is an 11-year-old boy who can pick up after himself but I still ***have*** to do it. I find that no one agrees with me. I fought with my Grandma yesterday about it and I get along with my grandparents really well but this time she said I didn't have to pick up after him but I apparently thought I ***Had*** to even though that has nothing to do with it. She also said that I was too controlling but I don't think I am. I needed someone to talk to about this and Reddit was my best option but I don't know what to do anymore!!! I have also told my brother this multiple times same with my parents but no one agrees with me. Pls if you have any Ideas. I will give you an update soon. Thanks!

I have no idea why because my parents don't have favourites but I do not do so much anymore.

Anyway, I am sick of picking up after him when he is an 11-year-old boy who can pick up after himself but I still ***have*** to do it. I find that no one agrees with me. I fought with my Grandma yesterday about it and I get along with my grandparents really well but this time she said I didn't have to pick up after him but I apparently thought I ***Had*** to even though that has nothing to do with it. She also said that I was too controlling but I don't think I am. I needed someone to talk to about this and Reddit was my best option but I don't know what to do anymore!!! I have also told my brother this multiple times same with my parents but no one agrees with me. Pls if you have any Ideas. I will give you an update soon. Thanks!

When I got home, I asked my girlfriend if she was ok and she said “yes, but my mum is really pissed me off” to which I replied “didn’t need to shout at her tho”  and asked her not to shout at her parents for very small things when I’m there as I feel uncomfortable in that situation now she saying I’m crazy for saying that because it’s not my place to say anything

So I just got back from vacation. I went with my friend and my significant other. The whole trip was great until we went to pay for the room and my friend expected my significant other to pay. I told her I would be paying his portion and that we would split it. She started saying it wasn’t fair since there were two of us and one of her. Originally we were supposed to go with her little brother and they would share a room in our 2 bed suite and I have my own. We had an even split originally. But the brother ended up not coming since he sold his tickets to my partner as compensation for getting me robbed last week. I did not want my boyfriend paying for the room as he did me a favor by helping reimburse me so much money. So now it was me sleeping with someone and her having her own room instead of sharing and paying for her brother. I feel like this is a no brainer and I stood my ground and made her pay. She was upset and now isn’t speaking to me despite living downstairs. AITAH? 

Edit: I was 100% fine with a 50-50 split even though it was her and her brother vs me. I find it weird that she’s not okay with a 50-50 split when it now doesn’t benefit her.

I was upset because we were so close growing up and now we had no way to see each other. And in our family, if you're more than like 15 minutes away, it's so hard to keep in touch. She moved back to our state a few months ago, but she's an hour away, so I haven't been able to go and see her. She's able to take a bus here, but she only did it once. She wanted me to go shopping with her at the mall, and I didn't want to because it's 30 minutes away and in a really bad area. So she suggested a park, but I said no because it was chilly out and it was just a field of grass with a playground. So we just got Taco Bell and watched TV at my house. She ended up leaving after like 3 hours, and told me that we could've done all this over a video chat. I felt bad but I can't do anything if there's nothing for her to do here. We could've gone to a bar or something but she doesn't drink.

A couple days ago she let me know about a concert coming up in September with somebody we're both fans of. I told her that sounded great, and that she'd have a great time there. She said don't you want to come with, and I said it's just too far of a drive, plus there's no parking lots there and I've never parallel parked before let alone in a big truck. She said she only moved back because she missed me, and that it felt like a waste of time and money because I don't visit. I told her she's just too far of a drive, and that she should've just found a town around here and gotten her license because it's hard for anybody to maintain a relationship with people who live at least 15 minutes away. I suggested she just keep visiting me, and she said she wouldn't be visiting because I ""never want to do anything"" (we go out to eat and watch our shows at my place, what more could she want). She said she was considering moving to another city 3 hours away and that I'm the only person she knows who thinks an hour is too far to see somebody.

So AITA for not going to this concert? I really like my sister a lot, it's just that I live in a town where I work from home and only go out to get groceries a 10 minute drive away.

A couple of years ago my father passed away. He had life insurance money left in my name. My aunt was paying for his life insurance. It was a good amount - not life changing for me but substantial. 

My step mom knew there was life insurance money and wanted me to give her half. My aunt was very adamant that she can’t have it. She knows a family secret involving my stepmom and really hates her for it (has to do with infidelity). I had already given my step mom money before and right after my dads passing (around 9k total and I paid for the funeral, which was 12k). There was also a big deal of cash in the apartment that she apparently took with her. In total she probably has been given the equivalent to 1/3 of the insurance money.

My stepmom claims she has been supporting my dad all these years. She also paid for my wedding 13 years ago and demanded the money back and then some. What threw me off was that she took me out to lunch and gave me an ultimatum - pay her what she asks and she will be out of my life forever or don’t pay her have her in my life as family and we will support eachother. I told her I’d rather have her as family. We cried and hugged. She later messaged me upset that I let her pay for the lunch and that she still wants the money. She threatened to come to my house. 

I probably would pay her back if I was comfortable with my finances but we just had another kid and we became a single income household. I know how hard she worked and she rarely took a day off so it gnaws at my conscience. I want to support her one day but the way she went about it was very off putting. She is now in china where she claimed as soon as my dad died that she plans on going and  has money there.

Should I pay her back for the wedding at least?

I found another student in my program to rent a bedroom in my house. We spoke on the phone and seem to hit it off well. I told her that I was an introvert and a homebody. And that rarely go out unless I'm hanging out with friends. I told her I like peace, quiet and tranquility. I view my home as my safe space away from the hustle and bustle of outside. She's an extrovert and said she totally understands. I told her rent is $1000 and she would pay $200  of the HOA fee and electricity would be split equally. I wrote up a lease with the terms and she signed. I don't think this living agreement is working. Our personalities seem vastly different. She's loud. Always coming and going. She lied about having a boyfriend. I said she could have overnight guests. Each guest can stay for 5 days within month without asking for my permission. I told her beyond that the guest must get my permission and pay a fee. When her and boyfriend are there they shower multiple times within a day as well as wash clothes several times a week. I'm worried this could increase my HOA fee. She started redecorating the living room without asking my permission. The lease states any redecorating, painting, hanging, or alteration must be run by me. I only have one mailbox key which I previously kept on my keyring until she asked for it to be kept in a shared space. Which I obliged but when I went looking for it, it wasnt there. I asked her to put it back which she didn't. I asked a second time which she said I will. She had to go find it which was why I kept it because I know she would misplace it. She never turns off the lights when leaving a room. I keep the thermostat at 78 to lower cost. She always turns it to 75. The electricity bill has tripled since she's moved in. I was sleeping one morning and found my front door left unlock. The neighborhood has a creep who likes to look in through the windows. I felt unsafe. She leaves the door unlocked so her boyfriend can come and go as he pleases when using the clubhouse gym and amenities which are in my name. Her and her boyfriend will spend hours in the living room so i can't use it. I thinking our personalities are just too different. I want her gone.

31,1d9r4dj,AITA for joking about my brother losing his job?,"TL:DR: A few days ago, my brother found out that he's getting laid off and made redundant. I laughed at him because he was telling me AI art makes artists redundant, and now he's calling me an asshole.

Basically, I do art commissions on the side. My brother jokes that I need a new side hustle now that AI art tools are around and no one really needs artists anymore. I'm not a full time artist, but those jokes annoyed me, so I tell him to knock it off. He doesn't and says that I should get used to it.

On Monday, he got called into a meeting where he was told he's getting laid off as the company he's working for has finished automating a lot of processes and because of that they don't have enough work for all the technicians. Since he's the newest tech, he got cut. 

He told the family in a group chat and after we did the ""So sorry to hear that"" and ""do you need any help?"" cycle for half an hour where I promised to help him tidy up his resume, I texted ""Guess AI was coming for your job too lol."" He stopped responding, and his girlfriend texted me saying that I shouldn't have kicked him while he was down.

I have been teaching him to walk on a leash and to sit and heel. Basic things for his furever home. 

He is a beautiful husky cross and everyone wants to pet him. He isn't ready for that much attention yet. He is skittish and shy. When I'm walking him I Cross the street if there are other pups. When people ask to pet him I politely explain he isn't ready. It doesn't always work. Some people won't take no for an answer. 

The last thing I want is for him to snap at someone. So I bought him a muzzle that looks likeva mean dog snarling and showing teeth. 

It works great. People stay away. He is getting more confident and enjoying our walks.

My partner thinks I am giving people a bad idea about him and that I am making him look like a bad dog.

34,1d9qvxx,AITA for exposing my friend for underage drinking,"Me and my friend just finished first year of college in Canada. I've known him for a year now, we hung out a fair amount. I always thought he was an...interesting person. He has the don't-care-won't-care attitude and I don't think I've ever seen him talk for 5 minutes without dropping an f-bomb.

I treated him as a good friend though, I know not many people around here do.

The legal drinking age in Ontario is 19. I'm 19 and he's staying 18 until almost the end of the year. I'm not worried about his tolerance levels. What I am worried about though, is the fact that he doesn't seem to care about the potential mess he could run into if he does get caught. Also, he told me that drinking is one of the only things he finds joy in now, since he got kicked from school for bad grades. I felt bad for the guy.

Recently we've been going to this one Boston Pizza. Usually only one of 2 things happen: either the waitress/waiter doesn't ask for ID so he orders alcohol, or they do and he says he forgot and gets turned down. He'll often get pissed if it's the latter. And while I kept my mouth shut, I've always felt like it's a matter of time before someone finds out. I never supported his behavior, though he might've thought I did.

Last night, we went to the same pub again. As he was ordering, I just sighed and shook my head a little. I never thought anyone would notice. The waitress asked for his ID and he said he left it at home. She then asked if he's 19 and he hesitated for a second. I sensed the waitress's suspicions so I signaled him not to try it.

She asked if he is underage. ""Are you underage? You're underage?"" This waitress recognized us from the last time we came here. When she realized she didn't check our age last time, she looked mortified. She denied him alcohol.

""Thanks man"" he said sourly. I still don't know if the waitress was alerted because of my reaction, or because she remembered to check IDs this time. Either way, he became bitter really quick. As you can imagine, that made the rest of our meal quite tense.

Later, he asked the same waitress if he could perhaps order just one shot, although she already turned him down earlier.

After we checked out, I told him that I only did this out of concern, but he wasn't buying it. He said that I betrayed him, and I'm a traitor. That I should just mind my own business and not interfere with others. That I ruined his night because of what I did. That I'm selfish. That if he got caught himself, he'll take the flak, but since I outed him first, I will instead.

Now, I know I might be the asshole here. Maybe I shouldn't care this much, I'm not his parents after all, nor was I trying to be. He does have a fair point in doing whatever he wants.

35,1d9qtcf,AITA For not agreeing to my husband's new chore list after I switched my work hours without his approval,"My husband (38M) and I (37F) have been married for 9 years and have 2 kids (8 & 6). He works a hybrid schedule so he's home 2-3 days a week. I'm a nurse at an understaffed hospital. Due to that staffing shortage, I was offered to temporarily switch my work hours to the overnight shift. It came with a nice bump in pay which could really help us out financially. My husband was very much against it because of the changes it would make to our day-to-day lives. I initially declined the offer but they countered with an even higher pay bump, so I took it.

It's been 5 months since I changed hours and my husband hates it. My hours are now 10pm-8am M-Thu and midnight-9am Sunday morning. I usually make it home just in time to see the kids off to school, run some errands or get things done at home in the morning, then sleep until the kids' bedtime and head to work. I like to think I've gotten pretty efficient at it since the change, but my husband disagrees.

I won't lie, he has had to pick up a lot of kid-related things that we used to share. Pretty much any rides they need are done by him. Any weekday activities he takes care of. Now that the kids are done with school we have them in a summer daycare program and he does all the drop-offs and pick-ups.

He's been complaining to me ever since the kids' school year ended that this isn't working for him anymore. He keeps asking when I can switch my hours back. I told him that the original plan was 6-8 months so it could be soon, but it's only been 5 months.

If I'm being honest, I don't know if I want to switch back. I'm making and saving a lot more money. Once I adjusted to the sleep schedule, I feel like I actually have more energy and can get more stuff done when I get home from work.

This past weekend, my husband practically begged me to ask my supervisor when I can switch my hours back. I finally told him that I'm not sure if I want to do that. He flipped out on me. He told me this isn't what he signed up for when we got married. He told me he feels lied to because not only did I accept the offer without his ""final approval"" but now I'm going back on my word that it would be temporary.

He said that if I'm going to keep my current night shift, then I need to do more things at home since I have the whole place to myself during the day. I asked him what more he thinks I should do and he actually made a list. He put pretty much all the yard work on there, which is usually stuff he takes care of and that I don't know how to do. I told him I don't know how to do all of that stuff and he told me ""If I can learn how to fold a fitted sheet, you can learn how to mow the lawn.""

I told him that doesn't seem like a fair division of labor and he told me that he's taken on all the kid stuff so I need to do more of everything else.

She left because she was unhappy there and constantly feeling overwhelmed and stressed, a decision which I wholeheartedly supported. 

Since she left, I've been helping her find work. She hasn't worked at any other workplace in over 20 years, so it was a bit difficult to find something. She had worked at that place since 2002. 

She got 3 job offers, one which pays the same as her old job, one that pays slightly less, and one that pays SIGNIFICANTLY less. She got paid $25 an hour at her last job. She accepted a job that pays $16 an hour. 

I tried telling her that she should reconsider this decision.

38,1d9qd9a,AITA for refusing to clean up my roommates cat's shit streak on the floor?,"Ok for context I've been living in this apartment with the same 2 roommates for 2 years now and they have an ancient cat with IBS. I'm not a cat person, I expressed this when I moved in, the fact that they had a can was a concession I made when moving in and I was told I would not be responsible for cleaning up after him. I have cat sat a few times for friends but I always drew the line at scooping the litter. I have never wanted that responsibility which is why I don't have a cat (I also have allergies to most) but I've had to clean up a few of his messes just to be able to exist in the space (ie. He peed on the floor and it's going to run under the fridge so I put paper towels over it cuz I don't want to touch that) 

I have ADHD and Anxiety that makes executive functioning really hard for me especially with cleaning tasks. My roommates rather recently made complaints that I'm not doing enough promptly enough to meet their expectations with the household chores.

Ok for context I've been living in this apartment with the same 2 roommates for 2 years now and they have an ancient cat with IBS. I'm not a cat person, I expressed this when I moved in, the fact that they had a can was a concession I made when moving in and I was told I would not be responsible for cleaning up after him. I have cat sat a few times for friends but I always drew the line at scooping the litter. I have never wanted that responsibility which is why I don't have a cat (I also have allergies to most) but I've had to clean up a few of his messes just to be able to exist in the space (ie. He peed on the floor and it's going to run under the fridge so I put paper towels over it cuz I don't want to touch that)

I have recently gotten married to his stepfather (38) and he has even moved in with us. My child’s biological father left when he was younger so I would expect him to have a hard time adjusting. 

My husband has told me countless times that my son has been being incredibly disrespectful towards him and I told him that’s unlikely because if my son had a problem with someone he would had already told me because me and my son have a close bond as far as I know.

Last night my son was playing on his Xbox which his uncle (who had unfortunately passed last year) had bought for him, he adored it and since he’s now out of school I allow him to play on it for a while as long he doesn’t get too loud.

While I am in my room reading, I heard my son yelling and he sounds angry so I left my room to see what was going on.

My husband had broke my son’s Xbox with a baseball bat and left him in tears.  

I was extremely disappointed and upset that my husband would do such a thing and I had a talk with him.

Now I ask for no special treatment because the way I see it when I walk into that factory I am not my father’s son I am an employee.

43,1d9p9h0,AITA for not staying nights while cat sitting?,"TLDR: My mom’s friend Amy asked me to cat sit, and expected me to stay there 24/7 despite knowing I have a job and inconsistent rides to her house. I still took care of them, gave them meds and stayed some nights, but she says I ‘didn’t do what I was paid to do’ even after offering her money back. 

This past January, my mom’s friends (We’ll call her Amy) texted me and asked if I 18F would be willing to watch her 2 cats for 2 weeks for $200 while they were on vacation. At the time I didn’t have a job and had online school, so it would’ve worked out great and I need the money. She said I could stay nights there so the cats don’t get lonely and so I don’t have to deal with rides. (I don’t have a car or the money for gas even if I did)  

About a month later she confirmed dates with me and I had let her know that I was job hunting. I told her that if I got a job nearby where I live, that
A) I wouldn’t be able to stay nights
B) I wouldn’t be able to stay days
C) I would be able to go and stay some days, but I wouldn’t be able to stay for long periods of time.

And she was well aware of this and I even asked if she wanted to find someone that would be able to stay 24/7. She said that it was fine if I couldn’t stay and still wanted me to do it.

The day before she left, I had finally gotten an offer for a job. It’s part time. On the days I opened and did day shifts, I wouldn’t be able to stay nights, just go either before or after my shift started. There were 2 days I wasn’t able to make it over because I had longer hours and couldn’t get a ride to her house (It’s about 30 minutes away from where I live) Since my mom works near Amy’s house, she stopped by during her lunch our those days to make sure they had food/water etc. I split the money with my mom for helping me with the cats and some rides. 

This last week has been very hectic as I have had a lot of work hours this week and we’re going on vacation ourselves tomorrow. I’ve only been able to stay the night twice this week and half of last week, but I’ve still made sure that the cats are taken care of and have their medicine.  

Amy has seemed like she’s disappointed I haven’t stayed every night. Today, my mom texted and offered we give some of the money back since we weren’t able to spend as much time there. My mom also pointed out that cats don’t need care 24/7. Amy snapped and said “That’s not the point. The point is that she was paid to do a job and didn’t do it” my mom started fuming, but didn’t want to respond while she was angry so just left the convo at that. 

I would like to argue that I very much did do the job I was paid to do, and let her know multiple times in advance that might not be able to be there every night.

46,1d9ozof,WIBTA for making my friend lose money over concert tickets?,"TL;DR: We currently hold 4 Taylor tickets and only need 2, as my friend cancelled on us. We now have to sell them and could make cash. 

This summer (2024), Taylor's Eras Tour is happening in Europe, where I live. Ticket sales started somewhen last summer (2023), and a person could only buy up to 4 tickets if (and only if) they got a resale code. My friend E (also from Europe) got one of those codes and she and I were planning to attend 1-2 concerts. Prices were unknown at that time.

A few days before presale started, my American friend (U) reached out to me, saying she and her friend (S) wanted to visit Europe next summer for a vacation. They're both huge swifties and have traveled to some concerts together. We agreed to buy 4 tickets (instead of 2), so they could join us.

Long story short, we got tickets after some rounds of sweating. Normal tickets (80-180€) were only available for 1-2 people - as we were 4 people, we could only buy VIP tickets (400-600€, including a tote bag!). Three of us (me, E & U, we couldn't reach S) decided it was worth it for our situation and bought tickets for 400€ each.

U & S transferred the money to E. They had to pay roughly $40 for international + conversion fees (international currencies).

Now, they messaged us to say they have to cancel. I've been trying to get ahold of them for exact instructions (do they want the fees back?) but no answers yet (I've sent a lot of messages over the span of a month to receive the answer they're definitely cancelling). 

As transferring the money back to U & S would cost us $40 of fees as well, we'd have to sell the tickets 80€ more expensive than they were when we bought them. Additionally, the official ticket-reselling site takes selling fees of 10% which would be +80€. 

With all the fees considered: For both U&S and us to not lose *any* money, we'd have to sell the two tickets for 960€ rather than 800€. It feels pretty unfair to us as some random people would pay for them not to be able to plan. Therefore we're thinking of *either* selling the tickets for the original price (800€) and transfer U & S the amount of money left after subtracting fees or selling the tickets for even higher than 960€ so U&S get all their money back and we get some sort of expense allowance. 

It is in no way an option for us to carry any of the conversion fees ourselves as we're busy enough with the reselling procedure and also had to buy the expensive tickets in order to go with U & S.

TL;DR: We currently hold 4 Taylor tickets and only need 2, as my friend cancelled on us. We now have to sell them and could make cash. 

This summer (2024), Taylor's Eras Tour is happening in Europe, where I live. Ticket sales started somewhen last summer (2023), and a person could only buy up to 4 tickets if (and only if) they got a resale code. My friend E (also from Europe) got one of those codes and she and I were planning to attend 1-2 concerts. Prices were unknown at that time.

A few days before presale started, my American friend (U) reached out to me, saying she and her friend (S) wanted to visit Europe next summer for a vacation. They're both huge swifties and have traveled to some concerts together. We agreed to buy 4 tickets (instead of 2), so they could join us.

Long story short, we got tickets after some rounds of sweating. Normal tickets (80-180€) were only available for 1-2 people - as we were 4 people, we could only buy VIP tickets (400-600€, including a tote bag!). Three of us (me, E & U, we couldn't reach S) decided it was worth it for our situation and bought tickets for 400€ each.

47,1d9on2y,AITA for siding with my brother over my very pregnant sister? ,"AITA? My brother, Spencer (38) bought an expensive Father’s Day gift, gave it to him, and told my Dad it was from all of his kids. The problem is, he didn’t ask any of us before giving it to my dad. If split evenly between the four of us, this gift  is still 3-4x what I would normally spend on a Father’s Day gift. He said he wanted to say it was from all of us because he didn’t think our Dad would accept such an expensive gift from only him. 

So I’m a little annoyed, but Spencer never asked any of us to actually chip in. I know that he has been having a rough time with my Dad, and I figure he’s trying to improve that with a big (thoughtful but way too expensive) gift. I talked about it with my husband and we agreed to kind of ignore it. It’s fine if Spencer wants to say it’s from the group or not, but since we didn’t have any forewarning, we don’t feel obligated to go in on this gift.

My sister, Ann, (34) had a different reaction. She feels that he made her complicit in a lie, and that she doesn’t feel safe being around him while he’s acting impulsive and possibly manic. Ann told Spencer he needs to talk to his therapist and psychiatrist, tell our Dad he lied, and told him that he was not welcome to be around her family or to meet her baby (who is due to be born soon) until he can manage his impulsiveness and outbursts. 

Spencer apologized to Ann, and said that he would do what she asked, but that he didn’t feel safe communicating with her anymore and that she can see his kids through his ex wife if Ann would like. Then he left our sibling group chat and also separately apologized to my other sibling and I for being impulsive and inconsiderate. 

I’m so frustrated and sad. I loved that my siblings and I were all talking again. It was a nice couple years. 

Ann said she is disappointed in Spencer’s response and said she didn’t intend for him to go no contact, but she was fine if he did. I told her that I loved her,  but I interpreted the same “you’re cut off. Stay away from me” message that Spencer did. I basically told her that she’s in the wrong and the ball is in her court. I might be a little biased towards Spencer because he is was much nicer to me than Ann was growing up. AITA?

Edits: 

the actual numbers- I’m a cheapskate and aim to spend for $25-$35 for a family gift like that. Spencer spent $400 for a second-hand grill that retails new for $1000.

48,1d9ocon,"AITA for ""not compromising"" with my boyfriends best friend?","Throwaway account. I 20f, bf 24m, his best friend 26m. We've been together for 6mo

We 3 currently live in a 2b 2b apartment. My bf (Jake) and his best friend (Caleb) used to live together but both of our leases were up and we all decided that it would be a good idea if I moved in too. 

Caleb has a gf currently and they decided at the end to our lease if they were still together they would move in together. Our lease is up in march 2025. Then there was an idea that the 4 of us could all rent a house and live together. So, just out of curiosity, we looked on Zillow

His gf (billie) recently got a newer car and her insurance went up so she wasn't sure how much she could pay. I suggested that if they were okay with it me and Jake would pay more for the primary. Caleb said no that's not happening and I said that's fine, I just want my space. he said okay spoiled. and I said we don't HAVE to live together.

If they can afford to put x amount of money for an house then they can afford their own place together. The next day me and Caleb talked and he asked what was up with what I said the night before. I told him that while I don't need a certain bedroom I do want a good amount of space for two people. He calls that spoiled. I don't think that me and Jake should pay x amount of dollars for a space that we feel cramped in or are not happy with when we can take that money and get a whole place to ourselves. I can afford what I want. why would I pay for something that I'm unhappy with. I only said that this was contingent on if him and Billie were still together. Obviously, if they aren't together then we'll keep doing what we're doing now. (he can't afford to live on his own)

He says that's not compromise. I am willing to give up the primary bedroom. He is insistent on having it. I don't need a certain bedroom. I just need a good amount of space for two people. I just want to be happy with what I'm paying for.

I thought we had resolved it but then two days Caleb texts Jake. (I can attach screenshots below). I would like to say again, that not living with Caleb next year was ONLY IF him and billie were gonna move in together. No one is leaving him out on the streets. I don't think it's spoiled because I want to be happy with a space that I'm paying for. Caleb took this and made it into a whole thing. Saying to my bf ""you need to get her right"" ""It's childish and selfish"" act. saying things like ""you can do better""

I texted Caleb last night and asked if we could talk after he got off and he just kept saying no and not until Jake was present. If you can talk about me you should be able to talk to me, right?? Caleb calls Jake and is like ""you're gonna ignore me for three days but then go tell her what I said so she can be on my ass"" Jake said ""I didn't go out and tell her we have an open phone policy"" Jake didn't tell me.

49,1d9o4i4,AITA for giving up on my depressed friend?,"
I (23F) live with a friend (23F). She’s been depressed for as long as I’ve known her. It’s never caused issues between us before, but lately it’s become her excuse for being a shoddy friend. I’ve tried to be forgiving, since she’s going through a lot, but now I’m reconsidering our friendship.

It started small. She slowly lost interest in hearing about my life. She’d snap at me over insignificant things and, when I called her out, got defensive and argued back until I apologized. She’s always been flaky with social plans, but she stopped telling anyone when she’d pull out – just wouldn’t show up, then didn’t acknowledge or apologize afterward. Weirdly, she’d always have energy to go for drinks with her colleagues after work, only to come home and give me attitude.

Then it escalated. If we ended up in the same room, she wouldn’t look at me or take her AirPods out, mumbled one-word responses when I tried to talk to her and rushed to leave as soon as she could. She didn’t read or reply to any texts I’d send her, but still posted on social media to joke about her depression. This went on for three months. I know she was struggling, but treating me like an inconvenience in my own home was hurtful, so I stopped reaching out and avoided her.

One day, she was suddenly back to normal. I started to get cheerful texts from her, apologizing for “being MIA”, saying “we should go out for coffee sometime”. I was unimpressed by her apology, but never ignored her completely, just sent back an emoji and kept my distance. She never followed up on the coffee. A few days later she sent a meme, immediately followed by a request for money I owed her. It felt like she was only being nice to save face and avoid the elephant in the room. 

Soon our mutual friends were checking up on me. My flatmate had asked them if I was “OK”, saying I “seemed distant”. Not once did she ask *me* this. I’d purposely kept our friends out of it until then, not wanting to kick her while she was down, but now she’d roped them in to avoid confronting me. I was angry, but waited to see if she’d bring it up next. She didn’t, so I did. 

Now she says I’m the AH because she *did* say sorry. I didn’t give “enough of a response” and she “didn’t know what to do” after that. Apparently she didn’t bring it up first because she’s “bad at confrontation” and treated me the way she did because she’s “a horrible person, I guess”. I think she’s the AH because it’s hypocritical to ignore me for months, then get upset when I stop trying with her. She’s the one who put distance between us first. I don’t think she tried hard enough to fix the problem. Why should it be my job when I get guilt-tripped anytime I call her out for anything? I think she’s more interested in looking like the victim than apologizing. But maybe I’m taking all this personally and making her depression about me.

50,1d9o2ie,AITA for telling my friend we ARE tourists and we shouldn’t act like we’re not? ,"Throwaway for privacy. I’m 21F. 

As a post-graduation trip, me and my friends are going on a trip to France next summer. This is my first time going to Europe so I’m really excited, and we’re currently in the planning stage. This issue concerns one of my friends, Katie (also 21F). 

Katie has never been out of the country, and somehow she’s gotten it in her head that the worst thing someone can be in another country is a tourist. I think she’s read too many articles and watched too many tiktoks about how Europeans hate American tourists. Anyways, she’s now trying to change our trip to be as un-touristy as possible. For example, she’s sent the rest of the group pictures of French street fashion and is insisting that we can only pack outfits that look like it. When one person said she didn’t have clothes that looked like that, Katie just said “guess you’ll need to go shopping.” She also says that Europeans do not wear sneakers and will immediately label us as tourists if we’re seen wearing them, so we can’t bring them (even though we’ll be walking a lot). 

Additionally, when I tried to suggest places for us to visit (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Versailles, etc), Katie immediately shot them down and said that those are too “touristy” and we should try and find other places to go. When I asked her what kinds of places, she pulled up some French residential neighborhoods and local shops and said we would be better off spending our time there since it’s more “authentic.” To be clear, she’s not concerned about avoiding pickpockets since we’ve already purchased pickpocket-proof pouches. It’s JUST about “looking like tourists.” 

In my view, there’s nothing wrong with being a tourist and doing touristy things as long as we’re respectful of the locals and French culture. Besides, if I’m only getting a limited time in France, I don’t want to be spending it all just walking around random people’s houses and looking at them like they’re zoo animals. I told this to Katie and she got upset and said I was the reason why Europeans hate tourists so much. I told her we ARE tourists, why try to hide it? I’m pretty sure French people would be MORE annoyed if we tried to act like locals instead of just being respectful visitors. 

Katie got even more upset and said that if I want to be disrespectful of French culture so bad, I can go to France on my own time. She then left our planning session. 

The rest of our group is kind of split on this issue. Most of them agree with me and think it’s a waste of time to walk around residential neighborhoods instead of seeing the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, but they also are very afraid of being perceived as annoying Americans.

My Dad and Mom had me when they were really young and spilt up shortly after. I was with my mum most of the time. When my dad was more in the picture again they had my twin brothers. When my brothers were three, mum found out my dad was cheating on her for months. They broke up (never married) and shortly after my mum found out she was pregnant again. At the beginning my dad and mum had 50/50 custody (I was already 18 by that time) but my dad neglected his custody time, so my brothers stayed with us and saw our dad every other weekend. When my mom gave birth I was with her, there were some complications and my mum didn’t make it. In her will she declared that she wanted her part of the custody to go to me. My mom left us enough money to live and I raised my siblings while working. My dad wasn’t at the funeral, never texted and saw his youngest son after his first birthday. He wanted to be more involved and got them two weekends a month. Over a year ago my dad didn’t pick up the kids from school and kindergarten when he was supposed to and the police found him drunk at a bar. Since that day I have full custody of all my siblings and my dad can only see them again when he proved to be sober more than three months. At the beginning of the year I got a good job offer, I talked with the boys and they were excited for the move, especially the older ons because their favourite soccer team plays here. I didn’t inform my dad of the move, because I wasn’t legally required to and he hasn’t seen us since over a year but I told my grandma (my dads mom) shortly after the move. Now my dad wants to take legal actions because I took his kids away and family members are calling me an asshole, because I am taking him the opportunity away to be a dad.
But he isn’t a dad, he never was. And I may be biological their sister but I am their mum, I raised them, I changed their diapers, I cared for them when mum died and he was drunk somewhere and I am their legal guardian.

Since that day I have full custody of all my siblings and my dad can only see them again when he proved to be sober more than three months. At the beginning of the year I got a good job offer, I talked with the boys and they were excited for the move, especially the older ons because their favourite soccer team plays here. I didn’t inform my dad of the move, because I wasn’t legally required to and he hasn’t seen us since over a year but I told my grandma (my dads mom) shortly after the move. Now my dad wants to take legal actions because I took his kids away and family members are calling me an asshole, because I am taking him the opportunity away to be a dad.
But he isn’t a dad, he never was. And I may be biological their sister but I am their mum, I raised them, I changed their diapers, I cared for them when mum died and he was drunk somewhere and I am their legal guardian. So am I really the asshole here? I don’t think so but the rest if my family thinks I am and even a few of my friends say that I should have told him. ",0.0,-0.012507668696343899,0,1
52,1d9nsr0,AITA for my BFs parents thinking I don’t like them?,"AITA for my hate of being touched apparently leading to people thinking I don’t like them?
 
So me (F27) and my BF (M45) have been together for two and a half years. We’ve lived together for over a year now, and I changed careers to help him run his cocktail bar. 
I met his parents probably a year into the relationship, and I’ve always been nothing but friendly and polite with them. 
But recently my BF has made comments that his dad in particular thinks I cringe when he hugs me, and thinks that I don’t like them. 

I’m on the spectrum which BF is aware of, and physical contact is very difficult for me. My mum and BF being the only people I really hug out of choice and everyone else I avoid touch or eye contact with if I can. 

My view is that it’s his fault that they think I don’t like them, for not explaining and I’ve not done anything to warrant them to think I don’t like them. It’s not like I deliberately cringe, and I try to be polite and force myself to hug them back when they go for one.

So AITA for his parents saying I don’t like them even though I’m trying my best to be polite and friendly?

53,1d9nq9z,AITA for asking my gf to confront her ex over unfair split of money for their children?,"I have been seeing my gf now for coming up to 2 years and found out that her ex-husband makes her put all her benefits into the joint account they have to pay for their kids outgoings before he and her top it up. I don't know the amounts but as an example it is topped up by 500 per month. She puts 160 in that are her benefits, which she receives as she isn't a high earner. They then spit the remaining 340 between them so he pays in just 170 pm. She has had to cancel a holiday we had planned as she couldn't afford it and won't let me pay for it as she doesn't feel comfortable me doing so.

I raised the fact, in a calm way, that if she were to stop the unfair situation with her ex then she would be able to afford it, as well as many other things for her and her kids. I also said I am not comfortable with him taking advantage of her and that he and his new partner earn well over 6k per month (they also each have rental properties from which they take an income on top of this) and I am struggling with our plans being cancelled. She apologised but has said she won't do anything about it as she doesn't like confrontation and he would make life difficult for her if she did.

Around the same time she started to have problems with her youngest child and calls her ex every day to discuss. Even saying to me that he is her support. 

Am I wrong to be offended by this, feel ignored and taken for granted? 

At another point I saw that he had put an x at the end of a text message to her (she was showing a house to me on her phone when it pinged through). At first I ignored it, but after a few glasses.of wine I said I wasn't comfortable said I find it hard that they have such a friendly relationship when he clearly takes advantage. Again she apologised, but it now seems that he is constantly 'there' and she doesn't seem to appreciate how that might make me feel.or that I have started to question what my position is in her life. She tries to reassure me that I am her happy space and her future. However, that doesn't seem like partners in life to me. Because of that discussion she has stopped inviting me to her children's football matches as he is there and she doesn't want an uncomfortable feeling because I have said I don't like her ex.

Am I just being insecure and needy or are these red flags?

My 16 year old daughter was going to go stay the night at my 18 year old nieces house. A couple days before we left my niece was over and I asked her and my daughter can you guys hang out here for awhile so the dog isn't alone for so long? They both said yes no problem. 

The night comes and we leave and I saw on life360 my daughter left the house a half hour after we left. I texted her and said WTF? You were supposed to stay awhile with the dog? She said my niece got there and wanted to go. We saw my niece a week later and brought up the fact that they didn't stay. She said in a smart ass tone ""well I guess you should have gotten a dog sitter"". Then she went on to say she didn't really want to do it so that's why she didn't.

I don’t want to complain about being small, but there are a lot of people out there (esp. other women) who will not take us seriously, are judgmental, make snide comments, assume attraction to us is nefarious, etc. A lot of comments that imply we’re not real women etc.

I’m used to it and usually let it roll off my back. But there’s a new one that’s picked up momentum that I guess stems from a TV show where a girl is putting on a childish act and she says “I’m a very sexy baby” in a cutesy voice and there’s a LOT more to it that you can just Google.

My SIL Cassie has picked this up and has been using this “against me.” I can’t wear a cute outfit without her coming down on me and chiding me for “buying into the whole sexy baby thing” when I am JUST WEARING AN OUTFIT. I’m just trying to be ME. God forbid I wear a shorter skirt or bows or anything I think is cute.

It’s like I’m not allowed to wear cute or sexy things because I’m petite so I’m automatically seen as trying to be a “sexy baby” when I’m not. I’ve asked Cassie to stop or drop it and she maintains that I’m the one opening myself up to judgment and I should dress my age.

This came to a head last weekend when we were in my auntie’s backyard at the pool. I took off my wrap so I could hang with my feet in the pool with my cousins and Cassie immediately said “You’re a very sexy baby” at me and twirled imaginary pigtails.

I raised my voice and said “That’s a really weird thing to keep saying. What is your problem with me? Why do you keep bringing up that I’m small?”

She started to turn red and she yelled back again that I’m the one that’s choosing to walk around looking like the “sexy baby.”

I said that I’m literally just wearing a bathing suit (a one piece halter) and asked her what I should be wearing instead if that’s such a problem.

She yelled back that I should “dress like a grown adult” and to stop trying to cause a scene in front of everyone. I said whatever and just tried to ignore her.

Later on we ended up inside at the same time and she came down on me for calling her out in front of everyone. I told her to stop trying to make me feel bad for being small, that I didn’t choose this body. She rolled her eyes and told me to grow the fuck up, and that “trying to start shit” with her is even more proof.

I am at a loss here and I’m starting to just not want to be around my family because of her. It’s not enough that I get this shit from women at work, at the gym, basically anywhere, now it’s in my family. AITA for calling her out? Or even for just… idk, existing in my own body?

**Edit** Hey I'm adding this in bc I can't respond to every comment, but it's my brother's wife, he doesn't care. Weve never been close/gotten along. He'll always take her side. Other people in my family are very hands off/handle your business yourself. Just the way they are.

This was finally my last draw and when I left him I took the Xbox , the beats speaker , AirPods I had gifted him for his birthday to try to even make up the money he borrowed but he stated that he will not pay me because his mom is my family too.

I told my fiancé about this and he thinks it's not fair for the middle to be with me all day while the oldest and youngest are at camp. I told him it's an easy, affordable option that benefits both us and, while I can bring the oldest, she'd be the oldest kid there and the activities wouldn't be developmentally appropriate for her so she'd be bored the whole time.

My fiancé grew up with his mom and grandparents. His mom struggled financially and lived with them while he was growing up. Once they passed away she couldn’t afford to live there anymore and moved into an apartment where he was living on a couch paying rent because they couldn’t afford to have more rooms and he has a twin sister. I moved out with him when I turned 18 and lived on our college campus. We moved to a 2 bedroom apartment in 2021 where we turned the second room into a gaming room since that’s something we both enjoy. We got engaged in July of 2022 and has since been planning for the October 2024 wedding. His mother decided due to her health issues, finances, and his twin moving out she would go into government assisted living, she had applied to a place and had been on the waitlist for 6m and was suppose to move in august but was not off. She panicked about being homeless and we decided that she could stay with us but we only had a couch which she has been sleeping on. We were told it would be 2-3 months. Around Christmas time she told me it would be another 6-8 months. We currently are 10 months in of her living with us and she still is on this wait list. She does not give us any updates and makes us feel guilty when asking for them. We love her but want to spend this time alone, we never agreed for it to be this long. We feel bad asking her to leave but then again her sister gets paid by the government to be her care taker. She picks her up for some appointments and showers 1-2x a week. If she cannot my fiancé takes her to appointments. She has a lot of health issues and cannot drive and has trouble walking distances. She needs assistance for a lot of things. Since living here we are helping her do a lot like getting her food and cleaning up after her. My fiancé does not want her here anymore but feels like asshole asking her to move out. I’m trying my best to tolerate it but with wedding planning and watching my niece 3d a week it’s a lot and I never get alone time either. Are we assholes for asking her to move in with her sister who has a spare bedroom and gets paid by the government to take care of her? We want to experience this new chapter in our house alone, especially bc we want kids shortly after getting married. Should we ask her to just move out for the month of October? Or in general?.

I’m getting married to my fiancé in October and we’ve been together since we were 17 and 20. I’m now 24 and so excited for this new chapter. This will be a long post so please be kind. 

My fiancé grew up with his mom and grandparents. His mom struggled financially and lived with them while he was growing up. Once they passed away she couldn’t afford to live there anymore and moved into an apartment where he was living on a couch paying rent because they couldn’t afford to have more rooms and he has a twin sister. I moved out with him when I turned 18 and lived on our college campus. We moved to a 2 bedroom apartment in 2021 where we turned the second room into a gaming room since that’s something we both enjoy. We got engaged in July of 2022 and has since been planning for the October 2024 wedding. His mother decided due to her health issues, finances, and his twin moving out she would go into government assisted living, she had applied to a place and had been on the waitlist for 6m and was suppose to move in august but was not off. She panicked about being homeless and we decided that she could stay with us but we only had a couch which she has been sleeping on. We were told it would be 2-3 months. Around Christmas time she told me it would be another 6-8 months. We currently are 10 months in of her living with us and she still is on this wait list. She does not give us any updates and makes us feel guilty when asking for them. We love her but want to spend this time alone, we never agreed for it to be this long. We feel bad asking her to leave but then again her sister gets paid by the government to be her care taker. She picks her up for some appointments and showers 1-2x a week. If she cannot my fiancé takes her to appointments. She has a lot of health issues and cannot drive and has trouble walking distances. She needs assistance for a lot of things. Since living here we are helping her do a lot like getting her food and cleaning up after her. My fiancé does not want her here anymore but feels like asshole asking her to move out. I’m trying my best to tolerate it but with wedding planning and watching my niece 3d a week it’s a lot and I never get alone time either. Are we assholes for asking her to move in with her sister who has a spare bedroom and gets paid by the government to take care of her? We want to experience this new chapter in our house alone, especially bc we want kids shortly after getting married. Should we ask her to just move out for the month of October? Or in general?.

60,1d9m0cq,AITA for Telling My Sister She Can't Bring Her Dog to My Wedding?,"My (30F) wedding is coming up in three months. I've been planning it for over a year, and everything is almost set. My fiancé (32M) and I are both really excited. We're having a fairly traditional wedding at a nice venue with about 150 guests.

My sister, ""Emma"" (28F), has a 3-year-old Golden Retriever named ""Buddy"" whom she absolutely adores. Emma has always been very close to Buddy, and he goes almost everywhere with her. I love Buddy, too, but I'm not as obsessed with him as Emma is. 

A few weeks ago, Emma asked me if she could bring Buddy to the wedding. She said he would be well-behaved and that it would make her feel more comfortable since she has some social anxiety. She even offered to keep him outside or in a designated area if that would help.

I thought about it, but ultimately, I decided it wouldn't be a good idea. Our venue isn't pet-friendly, and I don't want to deal with the logistics of having a dog at the wedding. There are also a few guests with dog allergies, and I don't want them to feel uncomfortable or excluded.

When I told Emma this, she got really upset. She said I was being unreasonable and that it wouldn't be a big deal to have Buddy there. She even accused me of not caring about her feelings or her anxiety. I tried to explain my reasons, but she was too angry to listen and said she wouldn't come to the wedding if Buddy wasn't allowed.

Now my parents are involved. They think I should make an exception for Emma because she's family and weddings are about bringing people together. They said I'm being too rigid and should reconsider, especially since Emma is threatening not to come. 

I'm really torn. On one hand, I want my sister at my wedding, and I don't want to cause a family rift. On the other hand, I don't think I'm asking for anything unreasonable by saying no to bringing a dog to a wedding venue.

63,1d9lo1p,AITAH for trying to warn my boyfriend’s brother that someone is going to end up calling the police on him?,"Hi! So this weekend we were all at the mall for a few hours. It was me, my boyfriend, both of his parents, his younger brother, and his baby niece. This is actually his foster/adopted brother, he is his parent’s blood son but his brother is not. My boyfriend and his parents are average looking white people, and his brother is a huge intimidating Japanese guy with resting bitch face (but he is a super cool guy!). His baby’s mother is a light skinned Hispanic woman, and the baby came out looking white, but I admit she is the spitting image of her father. He is also only 17 with a 2 year old daughter.

So the mall trip is fine, we’re all looking for a gift but we all of course get side tracked. Understandably the baby gets fussy after like two or three hours there, so her dad starts taking care of it. He doesn’t care much about shopping so he’s usually following us or finding a bench and playing with her, but he plays really rough with her. I noticed some people staring when he was grabbing her face and shaking it, but I brushed it off. Then he started carrying her around by her leg, which he does around the house because it makes her laugh, but we were in public and again people were staring. His mom told him to knock it off because the baby’s gonna get hurt and he brushed it off but he did stop. He kept being playful but rough with her, and a lot of people were staring. One lady gave him a really nasty look because the baby shoved some crackers into his mouth and he told her she was gross, which made her laugh but the bystander wasn’t so happy.

Finally, at some point my boyfriend was holding the baby, and his brother tried to take her back. They began playfully fighting over her because it was making the baby laugh, and eventually his brother snatched her and “ran” away. His parents and brother laughed but I noticed the people watching the scene and I was really uncomfortable. I finally told his brother that someone was going to end up calling the cops on him and he needed to be careful. Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, but I explained that I know he’s being playful but someone could see that and think he was abusive, plus he just pretended to take a baby that looks white from his white brother when he does not look white, which someone could mistake for some real kidnapping. 

Honestly things got kind of awkward and he just ended up putting the baby in her stroller with her iPad for the rest of the day. It’s been a few days since then and his brother nor his parents have been all that friendly with me. My boyfriend also expressed that he didn’t appreciate the comment, but I really feel like I was just looking out for him.

66,1d9l02b,AITA for wearing headphones during a dinner?,"I (18f) am actually autistic (diagnosed). I have a little brother that is 9 years old. I live in a very full house that consists of Mom, Dad, 3 brothers, 1 sister and her two kids (2ys and 8mon). 

I have very sensitive ears and I’m easy to overstimulate with noise. My little brother is the biggest culprit. He plays on the Xbox in our living room for multiple hours a day, talks to himself very loudly out loud, screams, screeches, throws fits if he loses a game and plays the game at a high volume. This happens for most of the day since it is summer. Being around him for longer than five minutes is enough to make me actually want to rip my hair out or need to take a nap.

So my solutions are 1.) don’t leave my room when he’s downstairs because even if he isn’t playing on the xbox, he’s still being incredibly loud and I’m not allowed to ask him to be quieter or 2.) noise canceling headphones. I chose the latter to avoid getting chewed out by my parents for being “moody”. I saved up $60 for a pair of Wyze headphones and now I rarely take them off. Currently I’m saving up for Loops for when I’m out and about, but money is tight.

But the reason why i might be the AH is because I live in these headphones. No matter what, when I’m home I’m living in these headphones. My family is loud and I can’t handle it. I feel like I’m always in an episode of The Loud House.

It was recently my graduation, so my family had a big dinner, which I wore my headphones to because I’m not about to sit in between a whiney 9 year old who got told to put his phone away and a 2 year old that doesn’t want to sit down. There’s just so much going on from the talking to the smacking of the food and the scratching of the silverware on the plates. So I wore my headphones to keep me sane.

My mom confiscated them because I was being rude that I was wearing them. Which this resulted in a little bit of a meltdown on my end because these kids beside me don’t know how to chew with their mouths shut and my little brother doesn’t understand the concept of an inside voice.

After dinner, again my mom chewed me out and told me that I was being incredibly disrespectful to my family for not engaging with them at dinner and wearing those headphones (that had no music playing other than white noise to drown out small sounds). I don’t like arguing or getting in trouble, so I just got my headphones back and went upstairs and locked myself in my room and had a good cry from how overwhelmed I was already.

I don’t think I was inherently wrong, my family knows I hate so much noise and that events like this make me physically shut down or temporarily go non-verbal. All of my friends are also autistic, none of us ever had an issue with each other wearing headphones during lunch period, or in general. And I could still hear the conversations of my family members (which alone with itself if overwhelming), so it’s not like I just ignored people. I just don’t like talking during dinner.

68,1d9kqy2,"WIBTA, if i stopped accepting gifts from my in-laws? ","So my daughter is 7months old and every time she outgrows a size my MIL comments and asks “what am I planning on doing with the clothes she’s grown out of?” I always answer the same, “ we sell the things she never really used or we didn’t like or that were already used when we accepted them and are worn out. Then we vacuum seal the rest of her clothes and items she has outgrown in case we decide to have another baby.”

 MIL always wants to hold on to her things especially things she bought my daughter in case her other son decides to have a baby. I’ve told her that they are more than welcome to the things we still have when we are done having children. Her son has expressed how the thought of a child freaks him out. He lives a lifestyle not suited for a child and his wife very much wants one but i figured they were both planning on sowing more wild oats first. I don’t have issues with anything they choose to do. I would LOVE another baby in the family but it’s absolutely none of my business. 

I also don’t want to hang on to certain things MIL bought my daughter as a “gift” and then decided she wanted them back. Where i come from a gift is a gift. We can do whatever we please with them. If she’s outgrown something or no longer plays with a toy i feel like we have the right to sell it and buy something she can enjoy with the money. If MIL’S “gifts” have an expiration date WIBTA if i told her we no longer want them?

So my daughter is 7months old and every time she outgrows a size my MIL comments and asks “what am I planning on doing with the clothes she’s grown out of?” I always answer the same, “ we sell the things she never really used or we didn’t like or that were already used when we accepted them and are worn out. Then we vacuum seal the rest of her clothes and items she has outgrown in case we decide to have another baby.”

 MIL always wants to hold on to her things especially things she bought my daughter in case her other son decides to have a baby. I’ve told her that they are more than welcome to the things we still have when we are done having children. Her son has expressed how the thought of a child freaks him out. He lives a lifestyle not suited for a child and his wife very much wants one but i figured they were both planning on sowing more wild oats first. I don’t have issues with anything they choose to do. I would LOVE another baby in the family but it’s absolutely none of my business. 

I also don’t want to hang on to certain things MIL bought my daughter as a “gift” and then decided she wanted them back. Where i come from a gift is a gift. We can do whatever we please with them. If she’s outgrown something or no longer plays with a toy i feel like we have the right to sell it and buy something she can enjoy with the money. If MIL’S “gifts” have an expiration date WIBTA if i told her we no longer want them? I I understand it sounds like drama but at the same time EVERYTHING with her is drama and I feel like if SIL does get pregnant MIL will be knocking at my door expecting things i don’t wish to part with because they have become sentimental or I’m saving them for our next child or Ive sold them because i have no use for them.

I asked why Danielle never had to babysit us? And how the littles are going to earn their keep since I know they won't be having more kids. I actually know why Danielle didn't have to babysit. They tried and she called her mom to come get her. It was a huge fight.

71,1d9k2fz,AITA for paying to build my child a home?,"I 35 female have been dating my boyfriend 37 for 5 years. We have a 4 year old daughter (Hailey) together and he has 2 children from previous relationships (Sarah 16 and Joe 17). 

I bought a property with about 6 acres of land when I met my boyfriend. And I always thought I’d build a house for my child on it when the time came. So when Hailey was born I immediately started a college fund for her and a separate account to eventually build her a house when she turned 18 on the property. 

She could live there while in college and still have privacy and space and could decide if she wanted to stay or buy a different house. If she stayed that plot of the land would be hers. (And when I say she’ll have privacy that plot is on the opposite side of the property as our current house on the 6 acres. I’m well aware she wouldn’t want to be directly next to me but would be close enough to drive an ATV to the house if she wanted to.)

My boyfriend is well aware of my plans and thinks it’ll be wonderful for Hailey to stay close
to us. My step children were older when I met them so we never truly bonded. I tried but they wanted to do their own thing and I always respected that. 

Joe came to the house this past weekend and asked when we’d be starting to build his home on the property. I asked him what he meant and he said since we were doing it for Hailey he expected the same since theyre both their father’s children. 

I was extremely surprised and looked at my boyfriend who told his son he didn’t own this property and that’s a big request. 

We talked about it that night in private and my boyfriend asked if we should use the money set aside for Hailey and build his son a house first. I said no. I love his children but they have a mother and a father. Hailey only has me and her father. 

My boyfriend thinks I’m being the ass hole because this will create a wedge between him and his children. He said his ex won’t be able to afford to pay for his son to build a home or buy one. And he can’t afford it between bills, child
support, and everything he has to pay for his older children. 

AITA? 

Edit: 

Ive seen comments asking about financials. We split the household bills 50/50. I make a higher earning and my extra money goes to my savings and Hailey’s. 

My boyfriend does send me money (not directly into her account but just sends it to me) because he wanted it to be a fair playing field that she got what she would have received for child support. I do take that money and deposit it into her account and I pay for all of Hailey’s needs.

He also pays for his older children’s additional activities since that was part of his original child support agreement. 

Just to be clear even if he stopped sending me the money for Hailey (which is fine) it wouldn’t be enough for his son to build a home. 

Update: 

We decided to have a family meeting. 

I dropped off Hailey with my parents just in case discussions got tense and she’s too young to understand. 

Joe and Sarah came to the house and we all talked. Joe and Sarah assumed their father’s name was also on the deed/mortgage because I bought it right around the time we had started dating and got pregnant with Hailey not long after that. 

Joe said the reason he thought he’d eventually also live on the property was because he thought his dad was also an owner and that my boyfriend always said he’d treat them all equally. Joe said he just felt like Hailey got an unfair advantage and he didn’t just because my boyfriend and his had him young and I had Hailey when I was older. He said he thought his father was doing it for all 3 of them. 

We did explain I bought the property on my own and that their father is technically a tenant. My boyfriend did explain the situation as Hailey having a different mother so difference financial situation the same way their friends parents may have different financial situations than we do. Joe said that’s different because it’s not his sister. 

I asked them how they knew about any of these plans. They both said they over heard different pieces of conversations and when they talked to each other they put everything together and figured it out. Sarah then explained she needed something from my office one day that we keep in the safe and when I opened the safe to get it she saw there was a file labeled Haileys Trust which confirmed their thoughts. 

Joe said he’s considering no contact with his dad if he doesn’t figure out a fair solution. Joe said when Sarah told him about the file that was why he confronted us the way he did. And Sarah said she just feels hurt that they’re at a disadvantage. Emotions did run high as to be expected. 

I just left to go pick up Hailey to bring her home but my boyfriend does look hurt he might have less contact with his older children from this situation.

72,1d9jz32,AITA for asking my spouse's friend to hold off from asking to visit our new house?,"A month ago, I (m59) sent this WhatsApp to Claudine (f57): ""Hi Claudine, just wanted to let you know that it's causing a bit of stress to me and Ella \[f58, my wife\] that you're repeatedly asking about coming to visit the house. We're having a very busy time, and we'd really appreciate it if you could give us a bit of space before inviting you over.""

Yesterday, we met Claudine. ""I just need to tell you,"" she said, ""that was the rudest message I've ever received"". She said that as a ""husband"" I shouldn't have got involved in arrangements between ""girls"", and demanded an apology. I pulled out my original message and read it out. I said I was sorry it had upset her, but didn't feel it was rude. After some back-and-forth, she then told us that her father had died two weeks ago, and abruptly went away.

The backstory: our friendship with Claudine and her husband Mike (m60+) has cooled in recent years. After we moved into a new house in November, Ella twice invited Claudine to come over, and once to dinner in Jan with Mike. None of those worked out, but they invited us to dinner in Feb (first time since 2019). We went, and it was fine. In late Feb, Claudine started proposing specific times to come to the new house, often at short notice.

On 1 May, while dealing with post-completion builder nightmares, Ella told me she felt under huge pressure from Claudine, who had sent a string of WhatsApps trying to set a time to come. I was irritated: Ella is tremendously kind and giving, and finds it hard to say no. That's when I wrote the WhatsApp message.

Checking this AITA in draft, Ella confirmed that I've never interfered with her social life except in giving her private advice two or three times in 30 years when people were taking advantage of her. And I've never stepped into her conversations with friends.

I felt the underlying issue here was that for whatever reason, Claudine had chosen to let our friendship lapse (she hadn't arranged to meet E in person at all in the past year), but then wanted to revive it because she was curious to see the new house, and was too persistent in pressing for a date.

I showed the offending WhatsApp message to another friend yesterday, who saw nothing wrong with it.

After yesterday's conversation, I sent Claudine a message saying how sorry I was to hear about her father. ""We'd have had a very different conversation if only we'd known."" I also proposed a date for them to come over for a meal ""if you feel up to it"".

Unfortunately, this made her angrier still. She replied: ""I chose to have the conversation...My father's death is irrelevant to this issue and I shouldn't have mentioned it. Still puzzled that you couldn't appreciate how your txt might have landed and offended. Thank you for invite...but unfortunately we have other plans.""

J is a wonderful kid, but not at all street savvy, and with mild anxiety - I was worried that they wouldn't have a safety net if something did go wrong, and with it being their very first time, I was apprehensive.

Knowing what time their appointment ended, I asked to have the afternoon off work, and got the bus into town. I waited to watch for J, and make sure everything went OK. It did - they got to the stop safely through a huge crowd, had their bus pass with them, stopped the correct bus, and as they were about to board, they noticed me in line behind them.

Jack has a speech impediment that causes him to stutter, it's not too bad at home but he really struggles to speak in front of other people due to some past bullying. He's ok when it's just his friends, but if he has to speak in front of the whole class, he can take several minutes to finish a sentence, which he finds very upsetting.

Me and my husband have spoken to the school and have arranged accommodations for Jack, all of his teachers know not to call on his for reading or to answer questions, and he is allowed to raise his hand or have a friend respond for him when the teachers is taking the register. He has a note from school with he can show his teachers if they question why he is not able to speak aloud.

Recently, my son has moved up to a higher level English class where he has a new teacher who I will call Mrs A.  Last week, she tried to get my son to read aloud, he showed her the note and she didn't make him, however she emailed me saying that she didn't think my son needed the note. I explained he did, and told her the school had evidence from his speech therapist, thinking that was it.

Basically, Mrs. A had asked him to read, he then showed her the note again, but she said that she had seen him talking to his friends and knew he could ""speak fine when he wanted to"" and telling him not to be so shy. When my son refused, she promised to let the whole class out early if he read, again he shook his head. Some of his classmates were understanding, but as it's a new class some of them don't know him as well and were upset at him for the fact they didn't get an early break, causing them to be rude to him.

Me and my husband were obviously very upset and sent an email to the school to report her, but I also made a post on the school's parent WhatsApp group calling her a ""cruel, power-tripping bully"" and explaining what happened. From what I can gather, a screenshot of my message got shared around with many other parents siding with me. However I received a message today from the school warning me not to use ""abusive language"" to describe teachers, and telling me to please speak to the school directly instead of complaining online, as it could ""compromise teacher safety""

Part of me feels justified in sharing, but I don't know if I went to far in calling her that and then sharing it to a groupchat with basically all the years parents, especially if it could really put her in danger. AITA?

  
***EDIT:*** *My son does have speech therapy and has improved over time, the accommodation aren't designed to be there his whole life and we are working on speaking in front of a group.

I \[41F\] have a son who I will call Jack \[12M\] with my husband \[42M\]. Jack has a speech impediment that causes him to stutter, it's not too bad at home but he really struggles to speak in front of other people due to some past bullying. He's ok when it's just his friends, but if he has to speak in front of the whole class, he can take several minutes to finish a sentence, which he finds very upsetting.

Me and my husband have spoken to the school and have arranged accommodations for Jack, all of his teachers know not to call on his for reading or to answer questions, and he is allowed to raise his hand or have a friend respond for him when the teachers is taking the register. He has a note from school with he can show his teachers if they question why he is not able to speak aloud.

Recently, my son has moved up to a higher level English class where he has a new teacher who I will call Mrs A.  Last week, she tried to get my son to read aloud, he showed her the note and she didn't make him, however she emailed me saying that she didn't think my son needed the note.

77,1d9jfej,AITA for not communicating well enough with girlfriend during mental health episode? ,"Lately, I've been emotionally overwhelmed and burned out. My girlfriend has been very sick for the last few months. I've done my best to support her and help her through this period - calling, scheduling doctors appointments, going with her, making sure she feels cared for, picking up prescriptions, etc. We rarely get actual time together; she sleeps most of the time. She works third shift and will sleep during the day when I'm at work. 

I'll get home, her kids will get picked up, and she'll go back to sleep until she gets up and ready for work - and I go to bed alone. It's been a very overwhelming, lonely couple of months. Also, a month ago I found she had been texting with her ex.. I was completely devastated. I actually left her over it, she begged me to come back and promised she would change, and I came back. We've worked through most of it, but it's something I don't think I'll ever get over and have what I would consider PTSD because of it. 

All of this came to a head for me a couple of days ago. I had an anxiety episode so severe that I could barely function; I was so exhausted I could barely speak, I had heart palpations that lasted well into the next day. When I came home, she immediately knew something was wrong. I told her it wasn't her fault and I was having anxiety. The next morning, we had an argument over me not communicating to her that I wasn't upset with her, me giving short answers. She said I was acting like a different person, and I can't do that if I have to look after her kids. 

I feel like she made my episode about her and how it made her feel, and basically called me selfish for having a poor mental health day. She told me she's honest and always tells me how she feels, which is obviously false, and I have to communicate. Cut to today - she tells me she's more depressed than she's ever been and having serious intrusive thoughts. I get scolded for not communicating my feelings, and the very next day, I get this in my lap. I'm absolutely not angry at her being depressed, I'm extremely concerned and will help her in any way I can, but I don't know if I can do much more of this..

I (23 f) had a best friend for many years. We were friends from fourth grade up until our first semester in college. We both got accepted into the same college and picked the same dorm rooms so that we could be roommates.

Everything was fine and dandy, she met a boy, I met a boy as well. Everything was great. Well I broke up with my boyfriend yadda yadda.

After our first semester of college was over we had to pack up our stuff and go home for break. She left a lot of big stuff like mirror carpet just stuff she bought. I tried texting her and go no response so I took the stuff home for safe keeping figuring she'd message and come and get the stuff.

Well a month goes by we don't go back to college. I've tried messaging her but I get nothing back. And I have anxiety so I don't like to pester people if they don't want to talk so I let it be.

Later on I come to find out that college boyfriend got me pregnant. I didn't know until I was 6 months along. So life got crazy I was doing my own thing. Covid hit I had my son.

I try messaging her later on but I'm blocked so I Instagram message her we talk for a bit, and She basically said that having friends is too much work for her and she just can't handle being friends with me anymore but that she'd try. And for a long time I felt like this was all my fault, that if I had tried harder then I wouldn't have lost my best friend.

And she isn't the only friend I've lost, I had another friend I've tried for a few years to get him from his house to go out and do stuff but he blocked my number as well and it just breaks my heart because I loved them both so much they were like my siblings and for two friends in the last few years just practically ghost me.

 my sister for 4k & a couple years ago we sold one to my mom for 2k. My sister and mom help us whenever we need anything and we see them very often. His parents don't call on his bday!

80,1d9j1hb,AITA for refusing to visit my boyfriend's family?,"Backstory: My boyfriend and I are currently in a long-distance relationship; he lives in the US, and I live in the UK. We have been together for over a year now. Despite this, we've encountered numerous issues with his family. They tend to be overly involved in our relationship and have shown a lack of respect towards me. Although I haven't met his family in person yet, we've interacted over FaceTime and through a few conversations. Despite these limited interactions, I somehow seem to be a source of tension within their family. I am scheduled to fly over there on June 18th.

There have been a number of instances of disrespect: 

His brother (20M) randomly brought me up during an argument and called me a ""b\*\*\*\*,"" along with a few other disrespectful remarks.

His sister (17F) randomly accused me of cheating.

Another recent incident involved his sister making a snarky comment about me. She said, ""Your girlfriend does not dictate your life,"" after my boyfriend asked me if we had any plans when she requested that he take her driving. I hadn't told him he couldn't go, but we had plans that I hoped he would honour, as one of our recurring issues is his tendency to cancel our plans in favour of his family's demands. During this incident, he didn't defend me, so I messaged her directly, asking her to keep my name out of the conversation and clarifying that his decision had nothing to do with me.

In response, she accused me of being controlling and trying to pull him away from his family, insisting that it's her family and therefore her business. In frustration, I impulsively called her a ""toxic b\*\*\*\*,"" which led to her insulting both my family and me further. She expected my boyfriend to defend her, but he did not, leading her to disrespect him as well. Although she eventually apologised to him, she refuses to apologise to me or even attempt to be civil.

For a couple of weeks, my boyfriend refused to do anything his sister asked, which made his mum question why he was acting that way. This led to an argument in which he defended me over the recent drama with his sister. His mom, of course, took his sister's side and ignored the bigger issue. She was stuck on the fact that I called her daughter a ""b\*\*\*\*"" and didn't care about the context or that I had politely asked not to be dragged into their arguments. This isn’t the first time she’s brushed off how I feel about things either.

Their behaviour has really made me uncomfortable about being around them in general, not just during specific encounters. Feeling unwelcome and disrespected has soured my opinion of them, and now I'd rather keep my distance from my partner's toxic family… AITA or the problem in this?

Now, sometimes I hang out with Mina just her, and sometimes I hang out with Alec just him, always at their apartment.  FWIW, I am a lesbian, and am attracted to neither of them.

Alec suggested we visit a city nature park together, because we both love being outside.  I suggested we go to a State Park instead, because I am collecting State Park stamps.   We agreed, and we set it for a few weeks from now.  He told Mina today, who texted me like, ""Uh, what are you doing?"" and I explained, ""Oh, we're going hiking!  Just for the day, I'm bringing my dog!  You're welcome to come!""  and Mina said she was worried she had invited herself, because when Alec had told her, her response was, ""Oh, awesome!  If I'm invited!"" and Alec had replied with, ""Sure, if you want to go.""

Now Mina is pretty upset that Alec and I made plans to go hiking without inviting her, and I'm wondering if I did something wrong?

The answer is I am not dead. I can't sell our home and give them that money since I need to live in it. I can't drain my retirement fund since I need it to retire. 


I have three kids, they all decided to go to expensive colleges. I paid for their books, and gave them money for food plan but tuition was on them. They knew from the beginning that college would be on them.

My youngest took some community college classes that to save money. The rest of the kids didn't do much to lower their expensives. They are all out of college and a whole bunch of debt. 

My mother passed away and she gave me the house. I am selling it for around 500k. I plan use some of it for a big vacation and then the rest to go into my retirement fund.

The answer is I am not dead. I can't sell our home and give them that money since I need to live in it. I can't drain my retirement fund since I need it to retire. 


I have three kids, they all decided to go to expensive colleges. I paid for their books, and gave them money for food plan but tuition was on them. They knew from the beginning that college would be on them.

My youngest took some community college classes that to save money. The rest of the kids didn't do much to lower their expensives. They are all out of college and a whole bunch of debt.

83,1d9ielc,AITANot wanting to possibly live with moms new bf (f18)," If I’m in the wrong and being a brat pls let me know. I (f18) have lived with just my mom and little sister since I was about 10 when my parents split up. When I was abt 14-16 my moms bf moved in and caused a lot of stress on me since they were really toxic and he was an alcoholic. She was constantly in a cycle of telling me they were gonna get married, to kicking him out of the house, to being soulmates, to being back out of the house. My dad was also very toxic towards us and would say really inappropriate and hurtful things about my mom. 

My mom now has a new bf but i genuinely don’t believe she even romantically likes him. She says she will learn to love him bc everyone her age has baggage so she needs to chooses her battles, considering he’s an absolute simp towards her. They’ve known eachother since they were 12 and my mom also doesn’t want to have to get to know another person from scratch.
But lately I’m noticing the same behavior, her saying they want to move in, to wanting to never see him again, to wanting to get married. She vents to be about EVERYTHING so ik the ins and outs of her relationships and don’t think they will last. 

They got back together again and now are talking about buying a house together. I told her that I feel uncomfortable living with another random grown man and don’t want to go through the same thing again. I didn’t want to make it seem like I was giving her an ultimatum bc I know she deserves to be happy in a relationship, so I told her I might want to move out, and all she said is that she’ll help me look.

It kinda hurt bc I wanted her to at least express at least a little of wanting me to stay.

Given this I am choosing not to talk to the guy besides hi to not be rude, and I will not be meeting his kids or go on trips with them bc I don’t want to put myself in another awkward situation and build futures in my head with these people as my “family” if they’re just gonna break up again in a couple months.

I also just don’t feel safe in a house with a random man, I fear one day something could happen and he could hurt us, considering we’re all girls. Which also makes me feel guilty bc what if I do move out and he hurts my mom and little sister and I wasn’t there to help. 

Should I give up my boundaries to possibly be able to protect my mom and sister?

I've been adding coconut oil and coconut chunks as per recommended by the DNR as an antifungal nutrional supplement to aid in them regrowing their hair.

My neighbor (The apartment is 5 studio apartments) has brought it to my attention that she has issues with my bird feeders and squirrel feeders and that according to her I'm trying to give her scabies from the squirrels mange. While I attempted to explain to her that it wasn't mange and that I called the DNR she quickly became defensive and didn't want to hear what I said.

87,1d9hcex,WIBTAH if I uninvite someone from my wedding for unfollowing me on instagram?,"~~I personally have never cared who follows me or not on social media. I think it’s a personal choice and I don’t need strangers to do it. But, I’d like a gut check on this.~~

My fiance (25M) and I (25F) are having our wedding in November. 

New Years Eve, one of my fiancés friends (Rob), walked up with his girlfriend and was like “this is Sarah (22F) and she is my plus one to your wedding!” 

Rob (M25) was barely on my invite list. Let alone some girl he just met. I said I was excited to meet her and was nice to her and I talked to her all new years since she was new to the group. But I was super annoyed and the whole situation was super awkward because our wedding is smaller. Everyone is invited by name. And no one received a plus one. But I caved and let Rob know I was going to invite her. 

Fast forward to today (6 months later). I went to her profile to get her full name for the invitation and she had unfollowed me and removed me as a follower. I checked his social media and they are still together. 

I am baffled as to why you would want to go to someone’s wedding and celebrate their love if you don’t want to see their stuff on social media (which is a million times less intimate)? 

To eat and drink and party for free? It costs me $291 to have her there. Someone who does not care to maintain a relationship with me or my fiancé. 

So WIBTAH if I just uninvited her? I wouldn’t have to let her know. She just wouldn’t receive an invitation and wouldn’t be able to RSVP on the website. She never got a save the date because I sent those prior to knowing of her. And our invites haven’t gone out yet either. 

My fiancé thinks I’m overreacting but my girl friends agree with me. WIBTAH?

Edit: Rob was barely on OUR invite list. We ended up inviting him because he was roommates with 4 guys who are groomsmen. This is a small wedding.

The appointment was initially on Friday but due to moms busy work schedule I had to postpone the appointment until the next day. My mom said that my dad had to go too and I said that he couldn’t because I’m only allowed one parent to go with me (not my rules). She said she was terrified of driving there alone because it’s too far (half an hour) and she might scratch the car that my dad paid for. I told her that I had the postcode so she won’t get lost, but she still refused to go without my dad. I told her again that only one was supposed to go and dad would be waiting in the car for a very long time. I’m also kinda nervous about telling dad about me going to the skin clinic (he doesn’t know yet) because I don’t feel comfortable with telling him about my insecurities because I know he’s very well capable of taking the P out of me.

She kept yelling at me and calling me selfish etc. I don’t understand why she got like this because she knows that I have an appointment and I almost missed out altogether when I was rescheduling for her sake.

89,1d9haai,AITA for speaking my native language in my workplace?,"I (23F) am a nurse in a specialty unit. I am fairly new and have only been there for six months. I’m not very good at navigating office politics but mind my own business and try not to talk to anyone. I speak a language that is not English as my second language, and get very excited when I find that other people also speak it. As such, I tend to speak it whenever I get the chance so I can improve on it. 

Recently I had a new coworker join the unit that also speaks my native language. It is his first language and I tend to speak it to him at work because we’re more comfortable with it. One day we were at the nurses station because it was nearing the end of the shift and we were just waiting to go home. It was double staff time, so all the nurses were gathered there, some having small talk, and some were doing/talking about work.

So I started talking to my new coworker in our native language about small talk, (in particular, that day i asked if he was gonna drive home) and another white coworker turned around and stated loudly at us (so much so that the whole room could hear) that we shouldn’t speak our native language around others and it was rude to do so because it excludes everyone. I was very shocked and angry and whilst I conceded because I dislike confrontation, my bad mood for the (very limited) rest of the shift was instantly noticeable. And none of my other coworkers said anything and I believe even avoided talking to me and the other native speaking coworker but continued to talk to the white coworker.

I’ll add a bit more context in terms of office politics here:

My other native language speaking coworker is very new, and has an eccentric personality, and I am vaguely aware that he is perceived as such by my colleagues in a divisive way. But I am very bad at navigating office politics so who knows. He is also slow to the uptake, but very bright and kind, and therefore I am aware that my colleagues talk about him, however I am unsure of what the general opinion of him is. But I know that the white coworker has a low tolerance for questions and may dislike him due to him being the type to ask a lot, and I mean a LOT, of questions. I am also aware that the white coworker dislikes me, however I am unsure why, as I had never been mean to her, and the only other reason I can think of is because, like the native speaking coworker, I am prone to being slow. I am also aware she may talk behind my back about me, however I always give the benefit of the doubt and am unsure of this as I have no concrete proof.

The place also has a lot of general gossip like talking crap behind backs and other stuff going on, but I like to not involve myself and I mind my business. Also, it is an Australian workplace, in a sort of small country town, so I’m not sure if it’s different to other places like America and maybe it’s just an Australian thing.

Anyways, sorry for the long post, I just really want to know if it was really rude or if it was valid.

I (19M) was in college for the 22-23 academic school year and got my ass obliterated. I had poor mental health and no motivation to work and ended up failing a class. I told my mom that I wanted to take a gap year to focus on myself, but it quickly turned into me not wanting to go back at all. 

One night, she asked when I'd go back and I explained that if I was to go back at all, it would be for writing and it would be part time. I could take things at my own pace then. Thats where the conversation ended until the next night when I came home from work.

My dad started off saying it was a bad idea and that I didn't want to do that. My mom even said that I had given her anxiety over that. I ended up explaining how I failed a class and the thought of going back was too much and made me upset. I ended up crying because of how much pressure had been let off by confessing to them. However, my mom was pissed.

She ended up taking over the conversation and talking about how I'd be in school for like 8 years and that dad and her were going to move down to Florida (we live in Missouri) pretty soon and that *not everything was about me.* It stung pretty bad. I don't remember saying anything to her, but I do remember coming to the conclusion that I wasn't going back to college. 

I feel absolutely terrible for lying to my mom, but I was so scared that she'd be angry with me. But, I think that way she talked to me confirmed those anxieties.

91,1d9h496,AITA for showing more enthusiasm towards one friend’s engagement over another’s?,"I (25f) have a friend, Amy (25f), that has been pressured by her parents to get married for a few years now. Amy’s parents introduced her to Bruce (25m) around 2 years ago and has been dating him ever since. Since before having met Bruce, she was getting pressured by her parents and every time I met with her, I was playing the therapist friend, but I wanted to be a good friend and be supportive regardless. She would only reach out if she’d had an argument with her parents but she wasn’t willing to do anything to change her situation. When she met Bruce, she wanted to work towards an engagement despite having confided in me about several serious issues. This relationship caused a strain on all of Amy’s friendships as since she started to date him, she has dropped out of plans with no announcement and she has isolated from friends. On the other hand, one of my other friends, Jamie (25f), also started dating someone (29m) around 2 years ago. Their relationship is  healthy and I can really see that her partner makes her happy and brings out the best in her. 

A few months ago, Amy and I fell out because she cancelled plans on us last minute whilst I was getting ready to leave. This was not the first time we had conflict over her doing something like this and I asked for space as we had been having discussions about our friendship for around a year and a half now. When Amy and I finally met up again to patch things up, she told me that Bruce had proposed to her. I couldn’t pretend to be happy for her. I did initially congratulate her but ultimately expressed my concerns to her that I thought she was jumping into an engagement because of pressure from her parents, rather than because Bruce was the one for her.

92,1d9h3oc,WIBTA if I said I’m not going on my in laws vacation?,"Me and my wife are both 25

My wife’s dad is from El Salvador and they were planning a trip there this august and assume that my wife and I are going. Her parents are well off and super generous. They’d probably pay for plane tickets, they would definitely pay for wherever we stay (and as I understand it, they sometimes stay at 3-4 places in total over the vacation because they like to change it up), and overall it wouldn’t be NEARLY as expensive as it would need to be for us. 

However, there’s a few reasons I don’t want to go

* I don’t have a passport and I’ve procrastinated getting it for long enough that I would need to pay extra in order to get it in time (something like $230) 

* We have a dog and would have to pay to have him boarded somewhere. This would easily be $200, probably more

* we just bought a car and combined finances (so we’re still getting into the flow of what that looks like for our budget) and in a month we have to register it and pay for sales tax. On top of that, we have 3 birthdays, Father’s Day, and a wedding this month, and weekends where we need to board our dog. All of this means we’re really not keen to spend a bunch more money because we already have a lot of extra expenses as is. 

* by the time the trip comes around, I *might* have just enough PTO; her mom was hoping we’d come for around a week. Even if I have enough, I don’t want to burn through the bulk of/all my PTO for the trip, and my partner might have enough for a single day, so we’d be forgoing about a weeks worth of her income. 

* quite frankly, and this may make me sound selfish, I just don’t want to go on the trip. I’m a very simple person and I love more than anything to just have time at home. I’ve never been on a week long vacation (my family would do a weekend, maybe 3 days, and that was always more than enough. At a certain point on those even I’d prefer to be home rather than stay longer). I also am a big fan of fair weather and I know El Salvador is very very humid and hot, and it’s been made clear that we’d be sweating 95% of the time we’re there. That’s miserable to me, even if it’s called a “vacation”. On top of that, we would be socializing with extended family a vast majority of the trip. I’m extremely introverted and almost certainly autistic, so that sounds exhausting to me. I need reprieve from my own close family after a few hours. It sounds mentally taxing to do full blown socializing for a week straight in the heat. My wife also said that Hispanic culture likes to socialize very late into the night, so we wouldn’t be able to retreat until wayyyyy late. I can’t imagine doing this for a week and then being expected to continue my normal daily routine after getting back. I would need a vacation from the vacation, which I couldn’t have because I’d be out of PTO. 

Clearly it’s mainly that I just don’t want to go. It’s great that some people can enjoy that kind of trip but it’s not the type of thing I would plan or do on my own. And the fact that there’s logistical stuff that plays into it gives me a reason to avoid it. In the future when logistical stuff aligns better I would force myself to go with because this is my wife’s extended family so it’s something I should do. But I’m not sure about this year.

97,1d9g1l9,AITA for kicking out my flatmate?,"My sister owns a flat. I lived in it with her & stayed for a year after she moved out to her partner’s place. I then moved out with my partner to a rental closer to uni & 2 of my friends moved into my sister’s flat (under an informal agreement as a student flat, not an official lease). 

Fast forward a year (2023), we’ve all graduated & have jobs - finances are hard for me & my partner, so my sister offers us cheap rent in her flat to help out as the two friends are set to move out. 

One friend buys a flat & moves out at the agreed time. The other (A) assures us he has plans to move into another flatshare shortly. We hear from my sister that A contacted her to say he’s not moving out anymore & has tried to arrange to move another friend into the flat instead without telling us. Obviously we confront him, but get times are hard, so he agrees to move out after Christmas when he gets a significant raise at work. We’ll still move in and make do with less space in the meantime. 

Christmas passes, A gets the raise and is on the highest salary (by several thousand) in the flat. He’s a terrible flatmate - shouting all night at video games, doesn’t do chores, blasts music & TV and raps regardless of all of us being shattered & needing peace after work, brings his long distance gf over for weeks at a time without warning us - of course we have talked about all of this with him (we get ‘oh sorry bro’ and then reverts back to doing whatever tf he wants). 

So now it’s summer - we talked to him about flat plans & that we need our space back as per agreement. In return we get ‘I’ll move out late summer into a flat with X, or by Christmas when I get another raise’. Heard that before! We then hear through mutual friends he’s told X they can move in here into our room this summer (there was a TINY chance me & my partner were moving out this summer, he knows it’s likely we’re staying & what we said re space still stands). 

We talk to my sister, who says if we move out she’ll sell the flat (so if we tell him that, he’s more likely to leave & we won’t have to move). We confront him & he BLOWS up, yelling about how we’re kicking him out, that X is a liar (X is not lying, confirmed by friends & by me having overheard a phone call between A & X). I tell him we’re not kicking him out, we’re asking him to honour his word, that he can’t force us to stay and live with him until he sees fit & that he’s in a much better spot than me & my gf & is seriously affecting us - we don’t get a second alone, no peace & it’s been so hard. This was not meant to be permanent. 

When shouting doesn’t work, he starts acting like he’s tearing his hair out and says he can’t afford local rent (he can, he out-earns us & spent £800 on dinners and fun with his gf in a single week) and that he’ll now have to ask his dad for money since we’re kicking him out.

We hear from my sister that A contacted her to say he’s not moving out anymore & has tried to arrange to move another friend into the flat instead without telling us. Obviously we confront him, but get times are hard, so he agrees to move out after Christmas when he gets a significant raise at work. We’ll still move in and make do with less space in the meantime. 

Christmas passes, A gets the raise and is on the highest salary (by several thousand) in the flat. He’s a terrible flatmate - shouting all night at video games, doesn’t do chores, blasts music & TV and raps regardless of all of us being shattered & needing peace after work, brings his long distance gf over for weeks at a time without warning us - of course we have talked about all of this with him (we get ‘oh sorry bro’ and then reverts back to doing whatever tf he wants). 

So now it’s summer - we talked to him about flat plans & that we need our space back as per agreement. In return we get ‘I’ll move out late summer into a flat with X, or by Christmas when I get another raise’. Heard that before! We then hear through mutual friends he’s told X they can move in here into our room this summer (there was a TINY chance me & my partner were moving out this summer, he knows it’s likely we’re staying & what we said re space still stands). 

We talk to my sister, who says if we move out she’ll sell the flat (so if we tell him that, he’s more likely to leave & we won’t have to move). We confront him & he BLOWS up, yelling about how we’re kicking him out, that X is a liar (X is not lying, confirmed by friends & by me having overheard a phone call between A & X). I tell him we’re not kicking him out, we’re asking him to honour his word, that he can’t force us to stay and live with him until he sees fit & that he’s in a much better spot than me & my gf & is seriously affecting us - we don’t get a second alone, no peace & it’s been so hard. This was not meant to be permanent. 

When shouting doesn’t work, he starts acting like he’s tearing his hair out and says he can’t afford local rent (he can, he out-earns us & spent £800 on dinners and fun with his gf in a single week) and that he’ll now have to ask his dad for money since we’re kicking him out. He’s been sullen & silent since. 

AITA, should I let him stay indefinitely?",0.0,0.031760480254888535,0,1
98,1d9fo4u,AITA for not inviting my birth family to my wedding even when my sister offered to pay for them?,"I was placed for adoption at birth. My older (bio) sister was placed when she was 5 months old. We're three years apart in age and we were adopted by the same parents and raised in the same family. I also have other siblings I grew up with who have no bio connection to me. My sister tried to rope me into a birth family search but I told her I didn't want to find them and offered her my support from the outside but that was as much as I was willing to give.

She found them 5 years ago and has been in regular contact with them since. Our family supported this and my parents have met my birth parents in an effort to support my sister but I still choose not to meet them or have them in my life.

My sister has passed letters to me from them and has been trying for years to get me to agree to meet with them and build a relationship. They keep saying how much it hurts them that I want nothing to do with them. She passes this onto me and tells me how much it hurts her that I won't be a part of this with her because our connection as blood related siblings is huge and now we have more blood related family (her way of putting it). I told her there is no part of me that wants to meet them and nothing I want from them. She told me she knows I have to want answers and I said no, I already know the answers, they were young when they had us and didn't want to be parents at that time. She asked how I knew that and I told her I did listen to her after she met them for the first time.

It's been so messy. I get letters from them about once a month and I try giving them back to no avail so I dispose of them and have never read them. I'm not interested. I can't be more clear than that.

Now I'm getting married and my sister fought for them to be invited. She offered to pay for them to come and told me she would cover all the costs associated with their place on the guest list and I still said no. She called me crying after she had been at their house because they were so upset to be missing it. She said ""our bio dad wants to walk you down the aisle"" and I told her that's not going to happening and that them being upset wasn't a strong motivator for me. I also warned her that the place we're getting married at has security and we already added them to our package (my fiancé has a couple of family members we need to have monitored in case they get too drunk) and I can easily pass on info about our birth family to keep them out if she tries sneaking them in.

My sister said I'm being unreasonable. My parents assured me they support me either way but want me to know I don't need to take my stance for their sakes (we had this discussion before too) and they'd be fine with them coming. My sister said if mom and dad don't care I should want my whole family at my wedding and I told her they will be. I don't consider our birth family my family for real. Her reaction was even stronger when the invites were sent out and our birth family didn't get any.

I can’t handle 10 kids so. I told my family I not going due to the fact my brother makes me look after his kids. cheese screamed at me for not caring about my nieces and nephews. Then his wife had a temper tantrum about divorce( I have now idea why, but every time cheese gets mad she cry’s about divorce). I ended up going to my room but I can’t stop thinking about it. Should I go?

ok  update: for you guys wondering how he has ten kids, his wife has 4 kids from her ex, he has 2 from his ex(twins) and have 4. almost  kids are over the age of 6 expect for the newest one. When I entered my room i overheard my mum talking to them, she said that they could just get a babysitter and make it an adult only vacation. Then my sister in law yelled At her about how she wants a trusted person. around a couple minutes later, cheese and wife left. Then hell broke loose, my sister( ill name her bean 23) went upstairs and yelled at me for not caring for my sil .

for you guys wondering why my sister(23) is not looking after them/helping is because she has a full time job and I work at the local cafe on the weekends, this is what Sli told me

100,1d9fazw,AITA for telling my mom it’s time to move out?,"I (26M) and my wife (26F) are newly weds. And got our place in October of last year. In November last year, we decided to help my mom out through a tough personal situation. We both agreed that before my mom moved in, rent free, there would be a clear understanding of how much time she needed and that, if in the time she moved in we felt ditterently, we would tell her we need our space back. We brought this up to my mom and she agreed; that at any point we want our personal space we can just say so and she'll move out. At first she would help out, clean, buy groceries, and cook(she insisted). Then all these things started slowly stopping until nothing was done. When these things were done it was met with an attitude towards us. She began to be cold and distant to my wife and I, and unfortunately it feels like we are walking on eggshells in our own home. Recently, after talking in therapy, we came up with a game plan as to how to talk to her. I approached the conversation in a de-escalation position but it didn't go the way we had planned (or any of the plans that we thought would happen). I had the conversation with her and while I did stand firm that she needed to move out, the guilt tripping hit a little hard.
Unfortunately, my point was not getting across and it was spinned as me going back on my word to help. My mom doesn't think it's fair as she has no money to move and her family is saying that I went back on my word of helping. So Reddit, aita?

Edit 1 for some more clarification:
The reason she moved into my home was because she was separating from my dad. She was supposed to do divorce papers and get that sorted, but she has yet to because she expects him to do it. She’s also on social security so she does have income coming in every month, while not a lot, still 6 months could’ve been spent saving, but it didn’t sound like any savings was done. We did clarify to her that there would be a check in 6 months in as to how we felt about her still living with us, so it was not new or randomly sprung up. She was 100% okay with this and said she had somewhere else to go (the family member who’s telling us we should give her time). So now we’re stuck because she alluded to the fact that that person can’t have her forever. I also don’t have any other siblings, I was an only child basically raising my parents growing up. Someone asked if she did this to me and the answer is yes. When I moved in every week we paid as much as we could and was constantly asked when we were moving out because we weren’t doing enough.

He also emptied out all the money he and my mom had before he left us, so he left us with literally nothing.

When grandpa drew up his will he looked into how he could leave my father with nothing but that wasn't an option. However, he didn't need to leave him with more than a single dollar and so that's what he did and the portion that would have been my father's was divided between my sister and me. He also left the house to my sister and me.

My estranged father attempted to fight the will and get the share my sister and I own but he was denied because my grandfather did everything above board. My father's siblings ended up back in contact with him after grandpa died and while they're not close like before, they have a relationship that my sister and I have no interest in being a part of.

So where the moral question comes in is this. My father has a child who has a life limiting medical condition. He and his wife are struggling to keep their heads above water with four young kids and not a lot of money. He feels I should give him my share of the inheritance for the sake of the kids, believing grandpa was wrong not to think of them at all in his will (he left nothing to my deadbeat's other children). I told him he wasn't getting anything from me and then my father's siblings got involved and they feel I should give him my share and that having the house and my sister having the money should be good enough but I could do it as an act of kindness for other siblings I refuse to meet or get to know. I have been under some intense pressure over this. And it's all driven by the illness/condition that one of his children has. I know that's the only reason my aunts and uncles are so bothered by it.

My best friend and I moved to this state together 6 months ago so I don’t have any family here or really know anyone here minus the friend I moved here with. 

My best friend had one rule she didn’t want weed being smoked in the apartment because with her job it could result her in getting drug tested if anyone found out. I was okay with that, I never really been much of a smoker anyways as it gets me pretty anxious. 

Well I didn’t realize that my friend had a bowl on her, we never smoked it and I didn’t even see it. But the next day her boyfriend saw it sitting on the balcony while I was at work. When I came home he flipped out on me and told me I had to pack my bags and get the fuck out now. I asked if I could at least stay the week as me getting kicked out like that meant I would have to drive a thousand miles to where my family was and I wanted to finish my work week so I could have some extra money to move. Neither of them believed me that I didn’t know the bowl was out there and said even if I was telling the truth the issue was I should have vetted my friends better. I had apologized for the situation I felt bad it happened, never would have left it out there if I knew it was there but it didn’t matter. I still had to get out now.

107,1d9dct7,AITA because we don’t want my fiancé’s ex at our house?,"Throwaway

My fiancé(26m) and I(25f) helped move some friends (a couple the same ages) up from another state to come live with us a little less than two years ago. They basically destroyed our apartment with dog urine and poop and after dealing with it for 8 months and being sick daily from all the ammonia, we had to get out of there. We wanted to buy a house anyway and we found one, but we still had to deal with living with our roommates because they were too poor to get an apartment.

The girl came with us to see the house and said it would be perfect for us and encouraged us to buy it. She assured us they would just live with us for a couple months in this very tiny house and then they would get their own apartment when they had the money. This house only has one bathroom which they both take so long in that my fiancé and I have both almost peed ourselves multiple times. They will literally be in there for over an hour.

Flash forward 9 months and they didn’t seem to have any plans of leaving whatsoever and they stopped working. So we had a talk with them about their plans and said we’d like to give them another 3 months to figure it out or they’d have to pay a lot more money to be here as, since we thought they’d only be here a couple months, they were paying hardly anything while taking up half the space. Well that talk didn’t go well but things weren’t said about it for a while.

1 month later they told us they’re moving back to the old state by the end of the month.

2 days after that the guy roommate mentioned their old roommates coming up to visit and help them move their stuff. He said their old roommates were “probably gonna stay in a hotel.” Well one of their old roommates is my fiancé’s ex and neither of us want her here. This is our house that we bought to start a family in and we don’t want his ex here at all no matter how short of a time it is. We don’t want to have to see her, deal with her, her using our stuff, her seeing where we live, etc. 

Well after we heard that, my fiancé talked to the guy roommate asking to make sure the ex wasn’t going to be here at our house at all. The roommate absolutely flipped out on my fiancé and called him crazy. He yelled and blamed us for screwing them over as they were just getting ready to settle down here (as in our house) and they planned to be here in our house well over a year and we were gaslighting them by saying they said only a couple months of living here. At no point did we discuss them being here for over a year and have no idea why they thought it would be okay to be here that long.

He yelled a lot more but I don’t have enough room to write it all. We have a possible solution for now if they agree, but he still continued to threaten to bring her over anyway because “they pay rent and have the right to.” Even though it is our house that we own and really don’t want exes at.

I said I was just doing what I thought would make her happy because I love her. I explained I was worried about her because she was so stressed out and she's so young, too, to be dealing with all of this.

But she ended up just getting angry. She said that I know she loves her bf more than anything, that I know he has helped her through horrible depression before and basically saved her life, even bringing that she could just leave was messed up on my part.

112,1d9cu1s,AITA for getting my niece to sing an offensive song?,"So I (32M) occasionally pick up my niece Sophie (10F) from school when my sister (38F) has to work late. This happens probably once a week and sometimes twice a week when my sister has a busy period in her work. I'm absolutely fine with pick up my niece as I love her very much.

Since Sophie was little, me and her would try and annoy my sister (her mum) by singing popular songs in silly ways, it was just a fun little thing me and Sophie would do. We'd basically change all the words in a song to something like ""Meow"". So say the song ""Hey now, you're an all star"" came on, we'd just say ""Meow meow, Meow meow meow meow"" in the same rhythm as the song. Sophie would find this HILARIOUS and we had a great laugh doing so. Even my sister would find it funny since Sophie has such an infectious happy laugh.

We've done this for years to the point that when I pick her up from school, we call it ""Karaoke time!"" and I have a playlist of Sophies' favourite songs. So to spice things up about a month or two ago, I changed from the meow's and went ""Hey Sophie, I'm a robot now"" and she was confused and I just changed it to ""Beep-Boop"" so the same song would be ""Beep-Boop, Beep beep beep-boop"" and she laughed SO hard and we sang songs saying Beep-Boop the whole way home.

Well last week when I picked Sophie up, I decided to change things again and I went ""Hey Sophie, I'm a door bell now"" and she again looked at me confused and I started singing ""Ding-Dong!"" and I never heard her laugh so much in my life. She could barely keep the song going because she just kept laughing. It's always so lovely to hear her laugh so hard.

I dropped her off at home with my sister and she was singing the songs constantly going ""Ding dong, Ding ding ding dong!"" and my laughed and said ""Thank you for that, shes gonna be doing this all night now"", I typically say Sorry not sorry and head off.

Well.... Yesterday my sister phoned me up angrily saying she got a call from school telling her to pick Sophie up from school as she has been suspended for the rest of the week. This is a shock to as Sophie is such a lovely innocent sweet natured girl who would never say or do anything bad. But basically Sophie has decided to do this fun little thing we did into school, but she changed ""*ding-dong*"" to ""**ching-chong**"".

Sophie is completely oblivious to the offensive nature of ""ching-chong"" and to make things worse, her teacher is half chinese and has taken great offense to Sophie's song. Sophie is very upset as she doesn't understand why she was told off. My sister is furious with me because she thinks I taught her that and I just feel awful about the whole thing in general.

EDIT: People keep calling me Sophie's aunt. I'm a guy just FYI lol. I put 32M.

Just to update you all. My sister has explained to her about the issues. Sophie feels very bad about it. The suspension isn't going on Sophie's files as my sister had a chat with the principal and they all agree that it was just a very unfortunately accident, the suspension has been revoked. My sister has apologised to me for being angry and I apologised to her too.

The teacher was very cold towards my sister when she went into the principals office and my sister apologised profusely about it and explained the whole car karaoke thing with me etc...

Interestingly.... The teacher tried to tell my sister that ""time with her uncle may not be good"" and my sister disclosed that i'm a loving gay uncle that had no intention of this happening to which apparently the teacher said ""ahh hes gay, no wonder there's an issue"".

This happens probably once a week and sometimes twice a week when my sister has a busy period in her work. I'm absolutely fine with pick up my niece as I love her very much.

Since Sophie was little, me and her would try and annoy my sister (her mum) by singing popular songs in silly ways, it was just a fun little thing me and Sophie would do. We'd basically change all the words in a song to something like ""Meow"". So say the song ""Hey now, you're an all star"" came on, we'd just say ""Meow meow, Meow meow meow meow"" in the same rhythm as the song. Sophie would find this HILARIOUS and we had a great laugh doing so. Even my sister would find it funny since Sophie has such an infectious happy laugh.

We've done this for years to the point that when I pick her up from school, we call it ""Karaoke time!"" and I have a playlist of Sophies' favourite songs. So to spice things up about a month or two ago, I changed from the meow's and went ""Hey Sophie, I'm a robot now"" and she was confused and I just changed it to ""Beep-Boop"" so the same song would be ""Beep-Boop, Beep beep beep-boop"" and she laughed SO hard and we sang songs saying Beep-Boop the whole way home.

Well last week when I picked Sophie up, I decided to change things again and I went ""Hey Sophie, I'm a door bell now"" and she again looked at me confused and I started singing ""Ding-Dong!"" and I never heard her laugh so much in my life. She could barely keep the song going because she just kept laughing. It's always so lovely to hear her laugh so hard.

I dropped her off at home with my sister and she was singing the songs constantly going ""Ding dong, Ding ding ding dong!"" and my laughed and said ""Thank you for that, shes gonna be doing this all night now"", I typically say Sorry not sorry and head off.

Well.... Yesterday my sister phoned me up angrily saying she got a call from school telling her to pick Sophie up from school as she has been suspended for the rest of the week. This is a shock to as Sophie is such a lovely innocent sweet natured girl who would never say or do anything bad. But basically Sophie has decided to do this fun little thing we did into school, but she changed ""*ding-dong*"" to ""**ching-chong**"".

Sophie is completely oblivious to the offensive nature of ""ching-chong"" and to make things worse, her teacher is half chinese and has taken great offense to Sophie's song. Sophie is very upset as she doesn't understand why she was told off. My sister is furious with me because she thinks I taught her that and I just feel awful about the whole thing in general.

EDIT: People keep calling me Sophie's aunt. I'm a guy just FYI lol. I put 32M.

Just to update you all. My sister has explained to her about the issues. Sophie feels very bad about it. The suspension isn't going on Sophie's files as my sister had a chat with the principal and they all agree that it was just a very unfortunately accident, the suspension has been revoked. My sister has apologised to me for being angry and I apologised to her too.

The teacher was very cold towards my sister when she went into the principals office and my sister apologised profusely about it and explained the whole car karaoke thing with me etc...

Interestingly.... The teacher tried to tell my sister that ""time with her uncle may not be good"" and my sister disclosed that i'm a loving gay uncle that had no intention of this happening to which apparently the teacher said ""ahh hes gay, no wonder there's an issue"".

114,1d9ct2w,AITA for getting my gf's mom dropped as a client from my work?,"Throwaway just in case.

For context: I (M20) work at an aquarium shop and my job is to do service calls to clean home and office aquariums. One of my clients (F) had a daughter close to my age (F18) that liked me so the client (I'll call her MIL) worked to get us together. Since then I have had a relatively close relationship with their family, but they are still a client of my work (until recently).

When I do a tank service call, it consists of cleaning the glass, cleaning the filter, testing the water, and changing some of the water in the tank with clean water. Occasionally I do a couple extra things, but that describes most of what I do. The problem is, MIL has OCD and is very particular about how clean she wants her fish tank. I have to also clean the back wall, which takes a bunch of extra time because I have to scrub it by hand, and I have to take a toothbrush to all the rocks to get (barely visible) algae off. Also, her tank is small and does not have a lot of room to maneuver, so I often accidentally knock over corals that I then have to reglue.

All that wouldn't be so bad if I had time to do it, but since her tank is small she does not pay a lot for it to get cleaned so the company gives me less time to clean it than most other services. This results in her tank cutting into the time I have to do the rest of the day. A couple weeks ago, my coworker covered for me because I was sick and she held him up long enough that the next service after him had to be canceled. When my boss asked me why her tank takes so long I explained the reasons above.

My coworker, who is the only other person that does service (everyone else is retail), just quit so my manager has to pick up a day of service and move the schedule around, and her service was immediately dropped. She is now pissed at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" (GF's words) and being the reason her service was dropped.

My GF is acting as a proxy for me to hear her complaints about me, but from what I understand she quite upset because I put all the blame on her and have not taken any responsibility for things such as knocking over corals every time as well as one time I accidentally spilled a large amount of water on their floor that I had to clean.

Since my parents don’t have much experience with weddings in America, they were fine with whatever we decided to do. Or so they said... 

The venues we are looking at have a max of 200 guests and my fiancé has a really big family (~80 and that’s after trying to reduce the number) and my family is small (~20). We’ve both invited around 20 of our closest friends and their plus ones so (~80 friends total) Now, my fiancé’s parents have also invited some of their friends but only the ones that know him (~15). My parents on the other hand made a list of 80 of their friends. I probably only know like 4 of them. My parents think it’s unreasonable for me to only let them invite their friends that I know since I don’t want a bunch of strangers at my wedding. My parents say that I can get to know them at the wedding so no longer be strangers and that they only mean well. I told them the venue has a limit of 200 and that they are going to have to greatly cut down the number of their friends. They found it unfair because my fiancé is inviting so much more family and not being accommodating for his friends. And that because my parents are also paying for the wedding it should be fair that they also get a say in who to invite. It’s not his fault his family is so much bigger than mine. But BRUH it’s our freaking wedding, not theirs. Especially because I know their friends are all really loud and obnoxious (if you’ve seen fob Chinese people, you’ll know what I mean). I told them to cut the number down which they agreed to do so but it’s still literally more than how many of my friends I invited. I was expecting around 15 which would be over the 200 limit but at least it is something we can work with. At this point I’d rather just invite acquaintances that I don’t even know that well just to fill up space so my parents will stop inviting strangers. 

In terms of who’s paying, it hasn’t been established yet but my fiance is willing to pay for everything if this gets out of hand.

120,1d9b0oz,AITA for not letting my husbands friend continue to live with us after he caused a break in?,"Sorry In advance for formatting, mobile user.

So a little backstory, my husbands friend moved in with us somewhat temporarily because he got kicked out of his family home. He’s been a great guest honestly, pays his rent, takes us out to dinner and cooks for us, everything has been very nice. He works a graveyard shift, so we only see him a few hours a day, usually in evenings.

Anyways, a few weeks ago, someone broke into our house at around 2-2:30. Luckily our bedroom has a deadbolt, so I locked myself in and told him I was calling the police. He grabbed a few things and booked it. Luckily, we have security cameras, so the cops were able to find him quite easily. That’s being taken care of right now. The things that made me extremely confused at the time was that our security system didn’t go off. We set it every night, and if a door is opened and the system isn’t disarmed after a certain amount of time, the police are contacted. The night of the incident the system was disarmed, and I felt like an idiot. I felt like I put myself in danger. That was until my husbands friend (I’ll just call him Dan from now on) told my husband and I the truth. Dan had been disarming the security system and leaving the front door unlocked every. Single. Night. He told us it was easier to just come home after a long shift and not have to deal with unlocking the door every day and turning off the system.

My husband and I were gobsmacked. I flat out told Dan he couldn’t live here anymore. He was surprised for some reason, but luckily my husband backed me up. He told Dan he wasn’t going to risk me to keep a roof over his idiot head. He’d rather have me and lose him. Dan was doubled surprised, apparently he thought my husband would bend for him, but he reluctantly agreed.

Sorry In advance for formatting, mobile user.

So a little backstory, my husbands friend moved in with us somewhat temporarily because he got kicked out of his family home. He’s been a great guest honestly, pays his rent, takes us out to dinner and cooks for us, everything has been very nice. He works a graveyard shift, so we only see him a few hours a day, usually in evenings.

Anyways, a few weeks ago, someone broke into our house at around 2-2:30. Luckily our bedroom has a deadbolt, so I locked myself in and told him I was calling the police. He grabbed a few things and booked it. Luckily, we have security cameras, so the cops were able to find him quite easily. That’s being taken care of right now. The things that made me extremely confused at the time was that our security system didn’t go off. We set it every night, and if a door is opened and the system isn’t disarmed after a certain amount of time, the police are contacted. The night of the incident the system was disarmed, and I felt like an idiot. I felt like I put myself in danger. That was until my husbands friend (I’ll just call him Dan from now on) told my husband and I the truth. Dan had been disarming the security system and leaving the front door unlocked every. Single. Night. He told us it was easier to just come home after a long shift and not have to deal with unlocking the door every day and turning off the system.

My husband and I were gobsmacked. I flat out told Dan he couldn’t live here anymore. He was surprised for some reason, but luckily my husband backed me up. He told Dan he wasn’t going to risk me to keep a roof over his idiot head. He’d rather have me and lose him. Dan was doubled surprised, apparently he thought my husband would bend for him, but he reluctantly agreed. He’s now completely moved out, all he brought was a computer and his clothes so it didn’t take long.

We had a lot in common so we got along so well, I was so fond of her and always wanted to protect her because she looked so innocent and vulnerable, she was like a little sister to me so I was really hurt when I found out about it.

I was in the bathroom that time and overheard her and her friends talking about her crush and how they look so good together, I wanted to join their conversation but then I heard one of them saying the name of her crush. Her crush was the same guy I've been having a crush on for 3 years (they did not have the same name it really was the same guy) I know that it's the same guy because her friends said that she's really lucky since she's in the same class as his. No one else is named like him in our class, so I know.

To add more pain to it... She knows that I like him. I can't accept the fact that during those times she was teasing me whenever my crush and I had an interaction, she started liking him too.

After I found out about her liking my crush, I started to avoid both of them. When her friends knew why I'm ignoring her, they told me that I was so sensitive and should've just understood her. They said that it was wrong of me and that I hurt her feelings. They told me I was envious of her since she's more pretty than me and that I was scared that he would like her back. I tried to tell them that I'm not, but they didn't believe me and told me that I should just support her instead of being so sensitive just because we like the same guy.

I recently signed up for a martial arts class, and my wife encouraged me to attend tonight.

She had thawed out chicken but didn’t really want to cook and wanted me to pick up food instead. As I left, I told her to let me know what she wanted, and I would pick it up on my way home.

After class, I called her to ask what she wanted. She had a place in mind but hadn't picked anything specific. When I suggested I could just get a sandwich, she said we didn’t need to waste money and that she’d cook the chicken instead. Fine by me. 

When I got home, I helped put the kids to bed. By 8:15 pm, she still hadn’t started grilling. Annoyed, I asked if she planned to cook it or if I should just go out. She started cooking while I watched a show with our oldest. By 9:00 pm, she still wasn’t done, and I expressed my frustration that I should have just picked something up. She responded, “You’re an adult and could have done what you wanted. I shouldn’t have to hold your hand through the adult decision-making process.” 

This sent me over the edge, so I left to get what I wanted as she was dishing up the chicken. When I came back, she said IATAH and that she did nothing wrong. I feel gaslit. Words were exchanged.

I'm 16F and very sensitive, and my mom is in her 40s. As background info, my parents and I share the same Messenger account to communicate with my overseas grandma. I realize this account sharing was a big no-no since a few weeks ago, I sent some pictures of me and my friends to my grandma through the Messenger account. Then a few days later, those same pictures were posted on my parents' Facebook account, allowing everyone who follows them to see the photos. I noticed it when I saw my mom scrolling through Facebook on her iPad, and when I called her out, she tried changing the subject and ignoring it. I felt upset by this invasion of privacy, but I didn't want to cause any arguments, so I said nothing more. But this changed today.

I recently returned from a trip and my mom asked me to send the pictures I took to my grandma through our Messenger account, and while I did so, I asked my mom ""Are you sure you won't post the pictures on your Facebook?"" My mom seemed defensive and raised her voice and said ""No, of course not, I wouldn't do that!""

She said how I was being selfish for not thinking about her or my dad and how much they love me, which hurt my feelings.

I started apologizing to her saying ""I'm sorry for making you feel that way. I know you and dad love and respect me, and I'm still so grateful to have you as my parents.""

For some reason or the other, it never happens. One year, the reason it didn’t happen was because 1) I couldn’t find any good ones 2) when I did find a good one it was sold out for everything except VIP. I looked into this about 2 months in advance for her birthday date and since then she has always made little comments to me about it. 

Fast forward to today, when I get a call from a friend who’s visiting me soon to celebrate my birthday a little early wanting to discuss our plans. Originally, we had already discussed tentative plans of her time with me including a brunch but after talking about it a little further, she wanted us to maybe look into doing something else. So while on the phone we both look up things happening on that Sunday where we then see a drag brunch. Not only was this one so much cheaper but you didn’t need a reservation. We get excited because we haven’t been to one before and I mention that I want to invite my friend because she’s always wanted to go to one.

 So I hang up and immediately jump up and tell my friend/roommate about this brunch. She’s into the idea until I tell her the date of June 16th. She then gets annoyed at me because she says I should know that she’s busy and “it’s funny” how I know she’s always wanted to go and it was supposed to be for her birthday and I couldn’t figure that out but now I’ve made plans to go without her. I felt so dumb because I did remember her mentioning that but I forgot that Father’s Day is coming up on June 16th (since I don’t celebrate that). I told her I’m sorry I forgot it’s Father’s Day and she said “of course you forgot. You forget everything”. Here, I said that my friend and I don’t have to go and we can find something else and I’m sorry for forgetting she had plans already and getting her hopes up. She said “no just go it’s fine” and then got up and left the room. 

I honestly felt bad for inviting her knowing that she has plans with her father and she’s always wanted to go but I was also annoyed that her immediate reaction was to throw that in my face even though it was a few years ago.

Originally, we had already discussed tentative plans of her time with me including a brunch but after talking about it a little further, she wanted us to maybe look into doing something else. So while on the phone we both look up things happening on that Sunday where we then see a drag brunch. Not only was this one so much cheaper but you didn’t need a reservation. We get excited because we haven’t been to one before and I mention that I want to invite my friend because she’s always wanted to go to one.

 So I hang up and immediately jump up and tell my friend/roommate about this brunch. She’s into the idea until I tell her the date of June 16th. She then gets annoyed at me because she says I should know that she’s busy and “it’s funny” how I know she’s always wanted to go and it was supposed to be for her birthday and I couldn’t figure that out but now I’ve made plans to go without her. I felt so dumb because I did remember her mentioning that but I forgot that Father’s Day is coming up on June 16th (since I don’t celebrate that). I told her I’m sorry I forgot it’s Father’s Day and she said “of course you forgot. You forget everything”. Here, I said that my friend and I don’t have to go and we can find something else and I’m sorry for forgetting she had plans already and getting her hopes up. She said “no just go it’s fine” and then got up and left the room. 

I honestly felt bad for inviting her knowing that she has plans with her father and she’s always wanted to go but I was also annoyed that her immediate reaction was to throw that in my face even though it was a few years ago.

So WIBTA if I still went to drag brunch without her? ",0.0,0.03279173746705055,0,1
129,1d99vcg,AITA for not going to my mom’s wedding?,"My mom (39 F) and I (19 F) have always had issues with each other. However, I’ve been away at college for the past year and completely independent. I have paid for my own dorm housing, car payments, and any other living expenses. There have been no points where I reached out to ask for anything. But in between moving from my dorm to my apartment, there was a 3 month gap where I didn’t have a place to stay so my mom let me go back home for the summer.

I was eager to find a job or internship to stay busy and contribute to household expenses. Yet, my mom insisted I take a month off to relax, only to hit me with a list of chores and expectations out of nowhere. Walking the dogs at 7am 12pm and 7pm, doing all the laundry for everyone living in the house (2M 2F), deep cleaning all of the bathrooms in the house, sweeping all floors, vacuuming all floors, mopping all floors, and what she referred to as the “daily tasks” of errands she would need me to run and extra chores she would want me to do. She expected me to complete the list in its entire every day of the week too. And when I tried to negotiate a compromise, she shut me down and said that I would either cooperate with the list or move out immediately.

So I got all of my stuff packed and left the next morning. I’m now living with my dad and staying no-contact with my mom despite her attempts to reach out and meet up with me.

The issue is that she has her wedding with my stepdad planned a week from now. I don’t plan on going. This is their 3rd time getting remarried and I don’t really think it’s something special i’m missing. I’ve gotten numerous messages from both her, her best friend, and my stepdad. My mom, asking me to meet for dinner and talk. My stepdad, telling me they miss me and ‘families fight sometimes but we have to stick together’ and my mom ‘will be broken’ without me there. My mom’s best friend asking if i will be there since she’s arranging the event.

I’ve only responded to the best friend one time, stating that I wouldn’t be attending the wedding. She responded with a story guilt-tripping me about how she lost her mom when she was 24 and never forgave herself for the memories she missed out on.

I haven’t responded to any of them now. I still do not plan on going to the wedding and I do not plan on staying in contact. There’s a lot more history with my mom, and i’ve been considering going no-contact for a while but there’s not enough pages in the world to write that story. I’ve felt pretty confident in my actions but I also have anxiety so of course now i’m overthinking everything i’ve done and wondering if i’ve made the right decisions. So a couple of questions here…

130,1d99uew,AITA for not telling my dad sooner about my relationship?,"
Yesterday I told my dad, when I told him he responded with “I already know”. I asked him what he meant and he said “I know my kids”. Nobody knew the exact time we started dating, to be, honest not even us. And the fact he just knew this freaked me out. He just said “it’s been two months right?” He asked me a few questions like his age and where he was from. While I was answering he said something like “as if I already didn’t know all this” and started laughing. I asked him “what?” Because I didn’t understand exactly what he said and he answered “oh no, no, nothing, continue” in the most sarcastic way possible. I’ve never posted him anywhere, we’ve never interacted in social media, we’ve never even commented on each others posts until a few days ago, we’ve never interacted in Facebook because I deleted the app months ago and just installed it like two weeks ago. His mom wouldn’t have told him, she was the one who told me not to tell him yet and even if she did she didn’t knew all the details that he supposedly knew already. My brother wouldn’t have told him and when I told him he didn’t understand how my dad knew. My mom or her side of the family wouldn’t have told him, why would they? They don’t even talk to him. And the things is nobody knew the details until literally yesterday I told my mom, my brother and my stepbrother. He also said” and I found out without following you”(this is the most accurate traduction since we speak Spanish and he said “ vigilarte”, which basically means stalking in this context. How would he know all this if he wasn’t? 

He changed his voice, like he was mad and asked me “Why did you wait so long to tell me?” I don’t think he even has a right to know if I don’t want to tell him yet. He doesn’t live in the same country as me and I told him I was going to when he came visit but he kept pushing his trip. I feel like he’s going to hold not telling him sooner over my head. He said “I would do anything if someone hurt my kids and I wouldn’t care what happened to me, you should relay that message”. And then said it wasn’t a threat. I’m genuinely so scared. Everything has been alright for a long time but I’m genuinely scared for my privacy and for my partners safety and privacy at this point, because a few weeks ago he told me my dad appeared on his Facebook recommendations, and I am the only friend in common, it was so weird. Everything he said felt like he was asserting dominance and trying to patronize me.

131,1d99oz0,AITA for no longer driving parents to airport?,"I have been the primary driver of my parents (75 and 81) to the airport for over a decade. This has meant things like rearranging my sleep schedule (I work 12 hour overnights) to make sure I am available to pick them up or drop them off. When I've said that won't work for me, or that I can't, I get guilted into it. About every other trip, my brother will do either pick up or drop off, but the rest of the time it's on me. For reference, my older brother lives just slightly further from our parents than I do. My younger siblings don't live in town. 

  
My mom has a bad leg and back, and uses a cane (and a wheelchair in the airports). She is disabled but able to drive and will walk, though she walks slowly. Her major problem is standing and uneven surfaces. My stepdad is in great health and regularly drives and hikes for miles. 

  
At the end of April, I dropped my parents off despite just getting off of shift, and only managing about three hours of sleep prior. Likewise, when they returned last month, I woke up early (though I got more sleep) to go pick them up in the middle of rush hour where it took me twice as long to get to the airport as normal. On top of that, there was some issue with checked luggage. It took nearly 2 hours after they landed to exit. Then I went and got the car so my mom didn't have to walk where they were doing construction. 

  
About two weeks later, I had a trip out of town. I asked my parents to drop me off. My mom said no, though sent me money for a cab. I was annoyed (I dislike taking cabs and ubers, I have a lot of social anxiety and am not good at just random chatting) but asked her if she'd be willing to pick me up. She said they'd see. I don't even remember why she couldn't take me. 

  
Well, needless to say, when I was heading back, my parents said they couldn't get me. The timing was wrong and they were tired. I said ok that I was done taking them to the airport. My mom tried to blow it off and said I didn't do it that much. I told her how many times I have done it and how much I've moved things around to make sure I could. 

She blew up at me, reminded me of all the other things she has done (which she has) and that she is elderly. Not only did she call me an asshole right before hanging up on me, but when I got home that night (I don't live with them but my kid was over there) she told me that her best friend also thought I was a giant Asshole for the way I spoke to her. I have little doubt my Mom blew the whole thing up to the point that she told her friend that I was screaming and yelling. That's a whole other situation. 

  
Anyway, am I the Asshole for refusing to drive my parents to and from the airport after they refused to come and pick me up? I've never really asked for them to get me from the airport before this.

133,1d99mg4,AITA For Eloping With My Best Friend,"I (F19) and my bestie (F20) have been best friends for the good part of 10 years since she came to the U.S from Sri Lanka. Now, I don't understand much about her culture or how her family dynamic works as I was born and raised in America. Now here's some context about her family and what happened that led to this.

Ever since I could remember, my bestie was always shit on by her family- ESPECIALLY her aunts back in Sri Lanka. Her parents hold her up to very high standards and are known to...not be very happy if she failed. Everything in her life has been decided for her- including her career. Currently, she is in school to be a nurse and she absolutely hates it. Not only that, but they planned to marry her off to some man in his mid-thirties. The plan was to marry her off this August.

Ever since freshmen year of high school I kept telling her to just book it the moment she graduated high school because here in America you can say no. This is where the culture and religious differences really differed from each other. I tried my best to be understanding and have an open mind since I had no right to judge another culture and cultures should be respected. Arranged marriages were the one thing I couldn't truly understand as she always said she could NOT go against her parents. And we always joked around that maybe we should just marry each other before she gets married off.

Fast forward to about three months ago, I get a call from my bestie and she is BAWLING. She said she didn't want to be married off to soon and now she might have to go back to Sri Lanka for the wedding. Me being me, I asked her what SHE wanted and if she'd elope with me so she didn't have to marry some older man.

She said she didn't know as she didn't want to disappoint her parents and they had already paid the dowry. I said I didn't give a crap about her parents and wanted to know what she and ONLY she wanted. She said she'd rather be able to pursue a career as a teacher and stay in the U.S. So, I bought a 200 dollar ring (listen, I'm a poor daycare worker ok?) and drove out of town to her place. Now, our love for each other is PURELY platonic and we're both aware of this. Long story short, I presented the ring to her and said something along the lines of, ""I am here for you no matter what you decide. I just want you to have a happy life.""

In the end, she decided to come with me and packed her things and left. Lately, I noticed she has been experiencing a lot of guilt over leaving her family. She does seem happier in some aspects, but I hate seeing her so sad- especially when I can't personally understand why she feels the ways she does and I feel powerless in helping her. I don't regret what I did, but I do regret seeing her turmoil that I may have been the cause of.

Considering this is a gift from Selena and I to our teacher, I don't want Jamie taking part. Is this fine; or am I being an asshole? I was thinking about how to just be direct, or maybe even just getting it custom made from a nearby bakery, even if it's more money. It's not the same, but I'd rather Selena and I chip into that together than have Jamie help. Writing this out makes me feel like the asshole, but I'd like some non-biased opinions.",1.0,1.0574493408203125,1,1
135,1d99hse,AITA for trying to save my bsf marriage?,"
I 27f and my bsf also 27f have been bsf since we were freshman in hs. Our 2nd yr & she met her bf & have been together ever since. When we were in college, they broke up & my guy bsf took interest in her so I played match maker because they had a lot in common. They didn’t really talk that much but def had feelings for each other. She decided to back to her bf & the communication died a bit but they were still friends on social media. They didn’t really speak much until 2022 when she was engaged to her bf. They developed deeper feelings telling other they loved one another & they eventually did have sex. At one point she was going to call off the wedding if my ex bsf was ready but he ghosted her. She confided in me that she didn’t want to get marriage but felt pressured by her family. The following year she gets a job offer in the same city the ex bsf lives & I said it was a bad move but she didn’t listen. She even left her husband & child here until the current lease was over. I felt like it was so she had alone time with ex bsf but she assured me that nothing happened. I should mention that on her bday, her husband confronted her about cheating but immediately forgave her & took her back & asked her to cut ties with ex bsf. Now it’s 2024 and she now talked to ex bsf everyday and possible lives together. She didn’t take him serious but no man would go to the lengths to say the things he said & not meant it. I told her that she need ed to end things because now that she’s married, she needed to focus on her marriage & not on what could have been. She said she would end it on her own terms but it was to the point where her husband knew and he been knew before the marriage. One night while talking to her, I told her that I can’t take her cheating anymore & would threat to confront ex bsf to be clear about his intentions with her or leave her alone. I should also note that I work night shift at a hospital and it was about 1am. She panicked told me not to interfere. Around 3am I made up my mind &sent the message via instagram because I had him blocked on everything & I knew he would reply the fastest on there. When I got off work, my phone was blown up by her calling, texting, you name it. She even used her husbands phone to call me but I didn’t answer because I was giving report. In my car, I finally answered to her screaming at me & telling me that I single handedly ruined both of her relationships and am the reason for her divorce. Her husband didn’t know what was going on and even called me when he was alone to figure out what the problem was. He said he knew it had something to do with ex bsf since I wasn’t talking to her. I still didn’t tell him and simply told him to talk to his wife. Things died down after that, but she said I broke her trust & she went back to her antidepressants. Our friendship isn’t the same & I’m only her friend cus her husband begged saying I was her only true friend. AITA?",Not enough info,2024-06-06,"AITA for trying to save my bsf marriage?

140,1d992k9,AITA for enrolling my son in a boys only school,"I have a son (12M) and a daughter (17F). Both kids were born in India which is where we are from however we moved to Dubai when the kids were young and then later to Canada. Son did all his schooling in Dubai and Canada and daughter all three countries.

We just obtained permanent residency in Canada but after that I decided it would be best for the family to go back to India as India has progressed quite a lot now. I was concerned about our daughter going the wrong way here as well, we even found out through looking in her phone she had tried alcohol and marijuana without us knowing.

We just got back to India despite the kids not being happy about it and daughter seems to be adjusting ok and will take university entrance exams here. However my son is not happy about the school we picked for him because it is a boys only school.

It is true that he has always been in co-ed schools before and most of his friends and best friends were mostly girls in Dubai and Canada. I think this was because he was teased by some boys when he was younger and one girl took pity and befriended him.

In India however most schools are not coed in my state and while there is one coed private school I could have sent him to, the school he got admitted to is a very good one and has an excellent track record, many current and former politicians went to this school and I had to pull a lot of strings for him to get in. I also think this will be good for him as it will be unhealthy for him to not know how to be friends with other boys especially as he gets older, what will his wife think and most of his female friends too will not want to still be friends once they marry.

So anyways we are going to leave tomorrow, something which has been planned for months when I get a call from my dad saying that he wants me to go to Texas this weekend (the funeral already happened and I missed it so he just wants me to see everyone there). 

I told him that I can’t and I’m extremely sorry that he passed but I’ve had this planned and he knows that I have, so I can’t change plans that fast, especially as I already have invested so much time and money into this. I do feel bad for missing his funeral but I couldn’t go with COVID and I did tell my dad that I would go to Texas after my trip, but he wants me to go while everyone is there so that’s not acceptable.

She told me no and when I asked her why, she said she didn’t want to travel with a fat daughter and be seen with her in front of relatives (I’m overweight but not obese, but I still know I should lose weight). 
   Fast forward to now. There’s a wedding in August on my mom’s side that my family (excluding my dad, he doesn’t know about it or the trip before) wants to go to. I am definitely still feel resentment towards my mom because of her comment and so I told her that I wasn’t going to go. She sarcastically said that she was sorry for her offhanded comment and that it was a long time ago. She is not happy with me and is insisting that I go, and my sister is saying the same. I know she wants me to go because it would look bad if I didn’t but I really don’t want to travel anywhere with my mom. My sister tells me I am not doing to the right thing, what should I do?
