0,1d9j5i1,AITA for losing every ounce of respect for my mom - whom I still live with?,"Just to start it off - my Mom used to be very sweet, I mean it was me and her 24/7, we'd play dolls together when I was younger, we'd  always hang out just us two when my other siblings were at school, she'd always take me everywhere with her - we were inseparable. 

Until about 2021 when I came out as transgender, ftm, at that moment it felt like she lost every single interest in me. she didn't let me join in with things, she wouldn't add me in on photos, she'd never talk about me - I've had 2 birthdays where she's just done fuck all for it but for her daughters she does everything she possibly can for them.


She did this until up to 2024 this year when I began just not caring what she thought, I cut my hair frequently I bind my chest and I really do pass as a boy. But it's like she chooses to ignore it no matter what, she keeps blabbing on about how me being a 'girl' is the best thing ever, she talks about me as if I'm the girliest thing on earth - I literally wear suits frequently. That is not girly actives. 
This year I've grown just a little more alone and to myself rather than keep trying to go back to her in hopes she'll accept me, I did that for the last time last year - and I will never do it again. she just doesn't get it, I don't know why, I could spill my heart and entire thoughts out to that woman and she'd just pick the bits she wants to actually listen too. Thing is I'm also confused because at the same time she keeps trying to talk to me and hug me and it's as if she thinks doing that now is gonna change anything, but it won't. For the past few years I didnt think much of her behaviour - but this year its really come to me that she's am awful person, I keep thinking to myself why should I be nice to a woman who won't let me be myself? Who won't even let me talk or think? she doesnt even believe that my mental health issues are a problem (They are.) I stopped telling her things - one time she sat me down for 30 minutes asking me to open up and I just stared at her, because I know she wasn't gonna accept shit I say. I don't hug her i barely talk to her, I don't like her. I've lost genuinely every ounce of respect or love for her this year and I find it unbelievable and unfair that she'd just now trying to get me to open up - yet at the same time denying any of my feelings.
It just feels like she's trying to act like she hasn't done anything.



idk, am I the asshole? should I be talking about my own mother like this? she did raise me, no doubt she raised me good - like atleast up to age twelve, some people tell me that I'm right for thinking like this but others say it seems disrespectful and i just don't know how to respect someone's feelings when they won't respect my own.

1,1d97l03,AITA for using the couch my roommate sleeps on?,"My ex and I (both mid-20's) broke up about a month ago. It wasn't a big fight or anything, but they admitted that they haven't loved me for quite a while and we broke it off. Of course, I still loved them and wanted to be together... and given that it was my first break up, it was incredibly hard on me. It still kind of is, but things are getting easier by the day. 

Throught it all, I've been told by quite a few people that I'm doing better than they would have expected. I had my tough times, sure, but I never lashed out or anything similar. My goal has been to still be their friend.

Anyways, I got home from work last night pretty late. While my job isn't super hard, I do take quite a beating throughout the day. Got home, took a shower, and went downstairs to make nuggets. I didn't want to go back upstairs while they were cooking because I usually can't hear the beep from upstairs, so I sat on the couch. 

For context, the two of us still live together. Our lease renewed in May and it's for a year. Yes, they signed the renewal knowing they didnt love me, but thats not the point. 

We split everything evenly for the most part, though I bought the vast majority of the furniture. The only exception is the mattress, which we went half in on. When we split, we were both sleeping in the bed for a while before they decided to start sleeping on the couch. I bought the couch so I offered to switch off every couple of nights or every week so they could sleep on an actual mattress, to which they said no. I keep offering though.

Anyways, I bought the couch, but they're sleeping on it. I figured it would be fine for me to lay down on the couch while I was waiting on my nuggs to cook. I moved their pillow and used my own, pushed their blanket back, and layed down on the couch. My feet were partway underneath their blanket, but it was my own pillow.

At this point, my ex got home. I greeted them normally only to be met with a sigh and them asking what I was doing. I responded that I was waiting for my food to cook, they asked why I was on their bed, and I kind of stammered out an apology before getting up. 

Without warning, they went around the house collecting all of their things and moving them down to the basement. I'm skipping over some things, but they basically said I crossed a line. They were incredibly angry and I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that what I had done was invading personal space or crossing a boundary. The couch is in the living room after all.

They said I can have my couch back and that's all they said. I just feel like a complete asshole due to them feeling like they need to sleep in the basement, but I also don't feel like I did anything wrong in this situation. Sure, they're sleeping there, but I was just laying down for a few minutes. 

I've already apologized so many times for encroaching on their space and I've promised it wouldn't happen again but it seems fruitless.

2,1d97gak,AITA for telling my 17 year old daughter not to throw tantrums while I'm working.,"My 17 year old had final exams today. She didnt get as high of a grade as she wanted. It was a C. She came home  literally crying and screaming about it while I (43f) was working up in my home office. My job requires a lot of video calls with other leaders in my organization, which is exactly what was happening when she came in the door. I had to mute myself so the background noise didn't carry  and couldn't participate in my meeting. I didn't react angrily toward her, but later I made a semi passive aggressive remark about it... something to the effect of, ""yeah I love it when you come home screaming when I'm on a work call."" She launched a verbal attack about how she cant help it that she is depressed and how could I possibly be angry and  said that I am horrible to her and don't care about her. I replied that she is allowed to be sad about a bad grade, but it doesnt warrant screaming and crying when she knows I am working. It's ok to be sad, but there is a time, place and way of expressing it that won't cause me problems at work, which is important because that is what keeps a roof over our head and food on the table. So, Reddit, should I be more sensitive to her emotional state or was I perfectly justified in my reaction? I really want to know so I can either work on myself as a parent or show her the opposite viewpoints posted here.  She is now demanding that I apologize to her, but I think I was being reasonable because at 17 she needs to grow up a bit to prepare to function in the real world, where that behavior won't be tolerated. I think she owes me an apology.

Update: I appreciate all your comments about how she may be experiencing an issue with her mental health. You're exactly right!! I should have mentioned a few things. 

1. We've had this conversation before about the importance of quiet, so yes I have spoken to her about this maturally as a good parent. I also didn't make this remark in the moment, but later when she was calm. And that was after I had given her a hug and talked about it. The remark I made was probably not kind, but was intended as a roundabout sort of reminder that her tantrums have consequences. 

2. Yes she does struggle with anxiety and depression and has been since she was little, but she has been in therapy that whole time and sees a psychiatrist. I have actively tried to help her for the last 14 years or so, and have been empathetic and patient. Also, this is not something she waits for home to let out. This is a deeper emotional regulation problem I think. I actually am super empathetic to ND and MH, but I cant help but wonder if she sometimes uses this as a crutch. Before you berate me for that statement, there has been a very fine line we have been dancing around between things that are out of her control and things that she just won't work on because she won't take responsibility and just blames Mental Health. So for example , refusing to work on things and therapy and instead just saying that she can't help it. Because I don't always know where that line is, I usually err on the side of it not being in her control. However, I do worry that in doing so I am not helping her emotionally regulate. It's just me and my daughter with no one to help guide me as a parent, so I definitely don't pretend to get it right all the time. That is why I appreciate your perspectives so much.

3. I've always tried to correct this behavior. One problem is the coparent I had working against me for so long, who did allow this behavior at his house and undermined me and put me down to my daughter. My daughter is now actually very aware that his behavior was unacceptable and acknowledges how hard I have tried to be a good parent all these years. Coparent passed away like 6 years ago and still trying to undo the damage, but again.... she is in therapy and sees a psychiatrist.

4. It's not just muting a meeting. I was expected to be speaking. 

5. This kid is smart and this was one grade, and overall her GPA is over 3.8 and she is going to a local state school, so this one grade is not going to ruin anything for her. Additionally, I later found out this was a weighted grade that equated to a B.

6. She is always loud. She sings, she talks to herself, she sometimes sort of screams for the smallest reasons. (I found something I was looking for! I just remembered my friend is coming over! I like chocolate!) This part is not a disorder, it's her personality. I've asked her nicely to keep it down many times before! Not all the time, just for a short while between getting home from school and when I am done working. I don't mind all weekend ir in the evening. I apologize that I referred to this as MCS. Poor choice of words. Was just trying to describe the way she feels like she is starring in a show and doesn't necessarily realize how loud she is being or how other people are reacting to the behavior. She would agree with this, as we've talked about it before. She is just very theatrical. 

7. Yes, I could go into the office. It's a 40 minute commute each way, so with gas, mileage and wear and tear, I just try to avoid it. I guess I feel like she isnt a little kid anyone and should be able to emotionally regulate more than she does. 

8. Despite all this info, yes a passive aggressive remark isn't the way to go. I hear you on that one! And I truly do appreciate all your opposing perspectives. They do help me take a step back and reassess the situation. Many people mentioned autism. I thought this might be the case when she was as young as 3 but was assured her symptoms didn't look like autism. Sounds like maybe I need to revisit that with her doctor. Current diagnosis is depression, anxiety, ADHD and borderline personality disorder.  She isnt taking ADHD meds at the moment. Stimulants were not good for her, so we're trying Prozac and a mood stabilizer and something for anxiety she can take as needed. I am very involved in her mental health challenges. We've been trying to figure this out for years. She is doing DBT and has done CBT.

4,1d95t1m,AITA for not going to my little cousin's birthday party? ,"I have a cluster of family members (aunts/uncles/cousins/grandmother) who live in Georgia (state). I haven't seen most of them in years, the last time being back when I drove through the area during a move to Florida for my then-spouse's job in 2015. None of them came to visit us despite an open invitation in all of time since then, which I get... my cousins have kids, jobs, there was a pandemic, and I honestly do not hold it against them but it absolutely takes center stage in my thoughts with what follows. 

My then-spouse and I have since concluded an extremely contentious divorce, and I am remarried with a 5-month-old in addition to my two children from the previous relationship. Since my eldest two hadn't seen their relatives since they were very young and my extended family hasn't yet met my spouse or our baby, I began talking in April to my mom (who lives in Texas but has visited GA almost annually) along with one of my cousins (Thea) in GA about planning a trip during the summer and settle on mid-July after getting no specific feedbac,since that is when a major home improvement project will be paid off and allow us to be more comfortable traveling financially. We provided dates, spouse put vacation days in, and we booked accommodations. 

Then Thea tells me in May that it would actually be better if we came in June because my other cousin, Isla (Thea's sister) throws a birthday party for her son that tends to double as a family reunion. Isla sends me an evite, which I text her about letting her know we unfortunately can't make it due to financial constraints and previous reservations, but I hope to see her when we are there. She responded friendly and with happy emojis, so it seemed fine. 

Thea has also indicated she understands we can only go on the dates provided, but then days ago her mother had her ask me if ""we are sure we don't want to go to the birthday party."" My own mother told me yesterday to ""just think about"" making a separate trip up at the end of June by myself, since my spouse has the vacation days set already. Dearest redditors, it is an 8-hour drive not including any stops... with a 12-year-old, 10-year-old, and a 5-month-old.

I don't THINK IATA for refusing to do this, but given that it keeps. Coming. Up. I would like outside perspective.

But over the past couple of weeks she has been saying things and starting rumors that I sleep with everyone I see and she has treated me like garbage. At first it was okay because I get some girls don't like boys with girls friends so I tried to back off. But after I hadnâ€™t talked to him in about three days, he showed up to my house  at like 10 PM and when we got inside he started crying because she told him that if we didn't stop being friends that they would break up and I know how much he loves her so I tried to stay calm but after him just crying for like 20 minutes straight. I had to do something. So the next day I went up to her and blew up at her for making him cry and she doesn't get a say because she doesn't know what we went through she was screaming to but in the end I walked out with my friend. It's been about a week since this happened and Iâ€™ve been getting a lot of texts and people coming up and saying that I was in the wrong and that I should stop being friends with him.  So I just need another opinion. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-06,"AITA For blowing up in my friend gfs face I (18f) have a guy best friend (18m) we have been best friends since we were 12 and around three months ago he got a girlfriend. Me and him have gone through a lot of trauma together and he saved my life when we got into a very traumatic bus accident at 15. After the incident we both needed someone and we helped each other.

6,1d94wam,WIBTA for not joining my (F23) girlfriend (F26) in her family dinners?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years. My girlfriend's mom has been hosting family dinners for about a year now and typically consists of her mom, her brother and his girlfriend, my girlfriend, and me. 

Her family likes me, but holds views that I ultimately feel go against me and my girlfriend. Talking points for dinner are generally homophobic, misogynistic, racist, classist, full of conspiracy theories, and so on. It's uncomfortable for me almost every time I go, and it's very rare we have dinners where these ideas don't come up. My girlfriend will speak up most times, but then it just becomes her family throwing insults and being degrading. I don't feel it's my place to voice my opinions in these dinners since I am just the girlfriend, but I have done so at times in the past. However, last time I did, her mother insulted me and and my family, and specifically my mother, and I walked out because of her rudeness. 

The dinners are frustrating and it's exhausting to hear opinions that devalue my own and other people's worth and not being able to say anything. Her mother has also made false accusations about me behind my back to my girlfriend, which then makes it hard to face her at dinner with a smile on my face.Â  

I've expressed to my girlfriend that these dinners make me uncomfortable and I am not sure if I want to go anymore. She said it makes her sad that I won't go and she wishes I could go. I said maybe I could just make my attendance less frequent, but that also seems to have made her sad. She says that they don't do it as much when I'm there, which is true, but when I'm not there they all just dogpile on my girlfriend x 100. She'll tell me about them the next day and I feel guilty for not being there. I feel like not going is not being supportive of my girlfriend, while going feels like I'm not supporting myself, and I don't know what to do. I feel like an asshole for not standing up for myself and my girlfriend while I'm there, but also an asshole for not going at all. My girlfriend wants me to have a good relationship with her family and I feel like not going won't help.

7,1d94tzg,AITA for bringing up my friend parenting after he said personal things to me first over silly argument? ,"


Me (M37) and one of my closest friends since kids (M37) got into an argument over something by so silly. Be prepared cause this is a silly argument that led into personal things being said. 

I was telling him about this girl I met last year who gave me her social media when we met but happened to be a sex worker. She never told me that but it was all over her page. We never actually hung out but talked from time to time. She hit me up a few weeks ago asking how I been and stuff. I told my friend about her hitting me up. I also told him I went on her social media and see she no longer a sex worker and totally against it. 

He starts saying you desperate man why you going on her page. I told him that me and her are already friends on social media. He says again so what you desperate and thatâ€™s when I lost it telling him I had better women then him in our lifetime. We argued about women which lead to a money argument with him saying he got more money than me and I got nothing he want

It then lead to him insulting my girlfriend mental health condition. She is bipolar. He insulted another condition of hers as well. I then said instead of you gambling so much and taking trips to Las Vegas you need to spend that money on your kids and all your baby mamas. I also said different men are with your baby mamas raising  your kids.

I hung up after that. A few days later he sent a long text basically saying he not getting over this argument because I brought his kids into it and that heâ€™s not going to fight me only cause he knows my family. We argued back and forth but havenâ€™t spoke since. 

Trying to figure out how to go about this and who was wrong here. Apart of me feels bad what I said about the kids stuff. Apart of me is also upset what he said about my girlfriend
