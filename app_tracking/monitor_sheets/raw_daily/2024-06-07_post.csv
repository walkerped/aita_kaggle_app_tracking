0,1d9znmz,AITA for asking my mom to reimburse me for groceries? ,"
I [F22] am watching my brother [M16] for five weeks while my mother goes abroad on vacation with her bf. Initially she was going to have him stay by himself the whole time, but I told her she couldn't do that because 1) he's still a kid and b) he has autism. Granted he has low support needs but you still need to remind him to clean up after himself and make sure he eats stuff other than top ramen. 

She countered having someone come for two weeks, but I told her that was still too long. I’ve always been guiding her on how to be a parent and taking over for her, even so far as going to a parent teacher conference for my brother when I was fourteen. I offered to have him come stay with me but she declined since he had summer school and work. 

She asked me if I could come and I told her I couldn’t just leave my job for an entire month as I’m a nanny and don’t have PTO. I compromised and told her if she paid my half of rent ($1000) I would ask to take an unpaid leave which I was lucky to my boss saying yes.

Fast forward and right before she leaves we were supposed to get groceries but we didn’t have time, so she told me she would pay me back. I said okay and things were fine. Today, I went grocery shopping and spent $145. I tried to be frugal and get stuff on clearance/sale to make it a little easier for her. 

I called her and asked her to reimburse me but she got annoyed and changed the subject. She asked how much was my brother working, which I didn’t see the point as he’s the child; he’s entitled to free food. She ended the call saying she would pay 
 me, but an hour went by so I sent her a request for money to which she’s still ignoring. Im debating if it’s worth the effort bc she’s usually really hard to get to pay back money, she’ll even get upset and start whining which makes me feel guilty but still. 

A part of me does wonder tho if I’m being an AH bc I am an adult and would have to pay for groceries anyways so I should just take the responsibility, but on the flip side I’m moving when I go back home and wasn’t trying to deplete my savings especially since I gave up a month of income ($2000).

3,1d9yyu0,AITA for telling my cousin's fiance she shouldn't get married?,"I (24f) have a very big family. I've been living in the .U.S for about a year now to be closer to my mum's side of the family. Most of my mum's side are all very religious. A week ago I was at my cousin Mike's (18m) birthday party. It was going good until the end when Mike was unwrapping gifts. At the end he pulled out a ring and proposed to his gf Jane (18f) of one year. Everyone was over the moon but the whole time I was just thinking about how Mike and Jane just graduated from high school. I told Mike's brother John (28m) about my concerns and he said it's always better to get married young. I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode because everyone is saying how excited they are and not one person in my family of 70+ people has expressed the same concerns as me.

In the country that I'm from (Ireland) I knew a lot of couples who got married young and they all ended up divorcing. Jane also has some undiagnosed mental condition. I'm not sure what but she definitely has something up with her. For example, at a birthday party a couple weeks ago Jane grabbed a stump and then started running around yelling ""I STOLE A STUMP I STOLE A STUMP"". She is very clingy somedays and the next is completely normal. I feel bad saying that because she is a very sweet girl but I'm worried for her because I know my family will probably have high expectations for her that I know she won't live up to. I came up to her at a party yesterday and had a heart to heart.

I told her that my family is probably going to expect her to have kids and if that's something she wants while she's so young. I explained to her about how this decision will affect her and she thanked me. She said she's going to rethink wether or not she wants to get married. I was honestly really proud of her for actually telling me how she felt. I got a call this morning from my aunt Clara (50f) who is Jake's mom, about how I need to stop sticking my nose in places it doesn't belong and how I just destroyed a relationship. i was confused because Jane and Mike didn't break up? She and my other relatives have been messaging me telling me that I'm irresponsible for planting ideas into Jane's head and how I need to mind my own business. I'm wondering if I crossed the line by talking with Jane so AITA?

UPDATE : Thanks for the response everyone I appreciate the insight. My Aunt Clara called me again an hour ago to talk to me. She was just yelling at me the whole time so I told her to leave me alone. She then said I was probably tearing down a happy relationship because my ex fiancee left me for another girl so I was jealous of Jane getting what I couldn't. That was the point where I went off on her and told her that Jane is not an incubator for future grandchildren, she's a real person that doesn't want to get married right now. She ended the call and said that she and a couple other family members will not speak to me until I apologise. Which will never happen. Mike texted me and said that his mom was the one who encouraged him to get engaged and like I suspected bought the ring. He then said that he didn't really want to get married either and thanked me.

I was hoping to get some advice/perspective on this. I am 29 years old and recently graduated professional school. I am working and making about 140k a year (pre-tax). I thankfully have no student debt but my husband has about 100k in student loan debt. My parents are divorced and my mother immigrated to the US when she married my dad 30+ years ago. The highest level of education she has is a high school degree, and she has never had an official job in the US after marrying my dad. Growing up she was a stay at home mom and after my parents divorced, she was receiving alimony for about 10 years before it stopped. She was running her own catering business for a while but that has stopped and she is currently unemployed and is struggling to pay her bills. She has not applied for any jobs and she frequently travels out of the country to visit family. My younger sibling was living with her and financially supporting her, but recently lost her job. My youngest sibling just graduated from college and received money from my grandparents, all of which she gave to my mother. I feel like my mother expects all of her kids, especially me, to help pay her bills as I have what she sees as a high income and zero debt. I recently got married and my husband makes about 60k (pre-tax) a year. We would like to buy a house and have a baby within the next few years so we are trying to save a much as we can. My mother has not explicitly asked me for money but she has made comments to my siblings, such as that I have not offered to help her out and she is unable to get a job without a college degree.

5,1d9yf6o,AITA For making my brother drink from a dirty cup,"I (17f) and my brother (14m) recently got into an altercation. Me and my brother split the chores of the house. I clean the kitchen while my brother does the dishes. Recently he has been getting lazy with the dishes and just throwing them into the dishwasher. This has resulted in cups and a lot of other dishes still being covered in food after being put away. I have brought this up to him and my parents after trying to eat cereal and realizing there’s food on the spoon. Or just seeing stuff in a dirty cup. 

My breaking point was when I grabbed a fork for one of my friends and seeing salmon from the night before stuck on it. The next morning I told my parents and brother how embarrassing it was. They told my brother, and he just replied with a nod. 

2 days ago, I went to pour some orange juice in one of our cups. I realized there was some stuff on the bottom. Tbh idk what it was. But honestly it looked like someone tried to make a protien shake but the powder got stuck on the bottom. I was so disgusted by it, I just skipped breakfast and just put the cup away.

Later my brother drank from that same cup. He screamed in horror. Luckily for me I was in the living room when it happened. I laughed at him,  and told him karma is a mf. He looked at me and asked if I knew. I smiled and said maybe. I tried to explain to him that it wasn’t intentional. But he ran upstairs before I could explain. 

During dinner (my brother didn’t eat with us) my mother instantly told me what I did was immature and mean. I explained that it might have been, but it was definitely effective. My father agreed with my mother, but also agreed my brother needs to clean the dishes better. My brother came to my room that night and told me that he was furious and extremely disgusted. That has really thrown me off. He has never been that like that, that confrontational which is making me feel very bad. He hasn’t talked to me since and I really don’t know if I was the AH. The thing is, this was all avoidable, but it will be effective. AITA?

I started attending AA and through that group I made some of my closest friends. It also helps that we are all sober and plan on staying that way so we can do fun activities without worrying about alcohol being around.

Whenever I’m with family or friends who do consume alcohol I don’t make them stop drinking as they can do what they want. My only rule is no alcohol in my place.

I’m throwing a birthday barbecue and invited my friends and family. As a good chunk of my friends are all recovering alcoholics and I don’t like alcohol around my place I have said it’s an alcohol free barbecue and I’ll be providing alcohol free drinks, I’ve even brought an alcohol free cocktail book to attempt some extra cute drinks for people.

My family have all said it will be boring without alcohol and that I’m fine when we go out and they drink. I tried to explain that a glass of wine with a steak is different to multiple beers at a barbecue, but they ignored that.

I ended up sending them a message that basically said “if you bring alcohol you won’t be allowed to attend my birthday” 

They haven’t taken it well and think I’m being an asshole.

8,1d9y6rm,AITAH for requiring my friend to make plans for a trip a certain amount ahead of time?,"I’ve had to move a lot for work, so many of my friends are scattered across the country. This requires either me to visit them, then to visit me, or for us both to travel somewhere and meet up. Based on my friends I’ve acquired this means the third case is the most frequent. Due to many of my friends being in a similar situation, we are pretty proactive in planning these trips, having flights booked at least 6 weeks in advance, and hotels and such booked shortly after.

I have one friend however who hasn’t moved much since college. And they have a more carefree attitude in general. This has caused them to be unsure if they will meet me in a third place most times we’ve tried to arrange visits until the last possible minute. I’m usually the one who tries to plan but because of their nature they end up putting off making any concrete plans. The last time I went somewhere with the understanding I’d meet them there I landed with no hotel booked and they never arrived for some non-important reason that could have been foreseen.

Part of my plan to mitigate this and make sure this wouldn’t happen again was to book refundable tickets and ensure things were booked and split cost wise at least a week or two before departure. I didn’t directly communicate this rule to them, but instead pushed hard on getting things booked over the weekends. 

When they asked me how far in advance I could refund my airfare I mentioned that I would refund if we didn’t have at least hotels booked 2 weeks before departure. This occurred a little more than 3 weeks before departure. Their response was “cancel it then, I don’t like ultimatums.” They haven’t texted spoken to me since.

I understand that their life is very busy right now (they just started a new job), but my life is busy too, and I’m putting in the work to try and make this work. I only feel like I’m setting up boundaries for my own sake, and they are being selfish in wanting to keep me in the air until the lasts second. I guess I just want to see if what I said was truly an ultimatum, and if it was, was it even fair?

I understand that their life is very busy right now (they just started a new job), but my life is busy too, and I’m putting in the work to try and make this work. I only feel like I’m setting up boundaries for my own sake, and they are being selfish in wanting to keep me in the air until the lasts second. I guess I just want to see if what I said was truly an ultimatum, and if it was, was it even fair?

10,1d9xohn,AITA for yelling at my sister for sitting on my chair,"I (19X) and my sister (16F) live in a 2 story house with my mom and dad. I have been dealing with extreme pain in my feet for a while and my parents finally agreed to get me a wheelchair (manual, Amazon and not custom). 

On the first night of getting the wheelchair I stored it so it would be easy for me to access at the bottom of the stairs, near my bedroom, for in the morning. When I woke up the wheelchair had moved to the original spot it sat in where I had put it after assembling it.

I thought nothing of it since I have in the past seen dreams so vivid I thought they were reality and just thought I’d put it in the incorrect spot. So, I got in the wheelchair and moved to the kitchen where I was greeted by my sister. 

My sister, after seeing me in the wheelchair, chuckled a bit and said, “I played in your wheelchair last night, it’s not made for plus-sized people” 

Though she meant it lightly, and I understand her curiosity if the standard wheelchair size would fit her, I was outraged she has ‘played’ with medical equipment that was meant for me. I know I am not one who is known for my tone and voice level, but I meant to tell her in a calm voice to not ‘play’ with my medical equipment and I believe it came off more as me yelling at her. 

She responded to me saying, “it wasn’t a big deal” and I responded asking if she’d do it to someone else’s medical equipment, she replied, “but you’re my sister”

Sister may be a gendered term I’m usually okay with, but it bothered me in this instance and I may have uttered names and vulgar words under my breath (but not so quietly) and the confrontation ended there, but now I’m left wondering if I went too far and AITA?

I haven’t had any problems at all, except that I sometimes have come a bit late due to the huge amount of projects. 

And, unlike the rest of my classmates, this semester I don’t have classes in friday, but I do have a bunch of group projects as we’re ending the year. So my groupmates (does that word exist?) and I agreed that I came to class in Friday so we could work on those, and I told my grandparents and my father (as they live together since the divorce) why I needed to leave, who I was going with, where, what we were going to do and an aproximation about the time I would return. Thing is, when I was asked when I was leaving I said “after lunch”, instead of an specific hour like 1 PM (when we finish eating), and later in Friday my classmates asked if I could go before the agreed hour since they finished earlier, and because it was 12:30 PM, only thirthy minutes earlier than expected, I agreed and left. My grandmother called me while on the train to ask me where I was, if I had gone outside already, and I told her that I was on my way to class. I heard an “okay” before she hung up. 

Fast forward to the afternoon, I’ve been at home for like two hours and my grandmother arrives after being out the whole day. Greets her husband and her son, but when she sees me, she gets considerably angrier and says she’s going to scold me and that I need to tell her whenever I leave, and what I will be doing, because “if anything were to happen, it would be my fault”. I said I already told her everything the day before, that I only left thirty minutes earlier, and she replied that I was going to leave *after lunch*. I didn’t want to keep the conversation and focused in my computer as she left. 
At dinner time, I entered the kitchen and my grandmother didn’t doubt to bring the topic again, to which my father and gandfather sided with her. She said they couldn’t make the planned meal because I had already left before they started cooking it, and I defended myself repliying that I had seen my grandfather right at the door of the appartment block and that they already knew what I was going to do, to the point of knowing what project we would be working on and the specifics of it.

17,1damv7p,AITA for not telling my mom my brother bought a motorcycle? ,"I (27F) went with my brother (24M) on a trip a few weeks ago to pick up a used motorcycle. He told me he wanted to fix it up and sell it, but also maybe ride it a little. He did this while my mom was out of the country, so we didn’t have to say anything to her. Neither one of us live at home. He’s married with a newborn and I live 2 hours away… I was there watching her house while she was gone. 

Fast forward to today. I’m at work (now back at my home), and she texts me asking if I knew about his motorcycle. I thought “oh he finally told her”. My mom has been weird about motorcycles for YEARS. She doesn’t like them and we knew she was going to be weird about this one. I said “yeah, I went with him to get it”. She then proceeded to ask me how much he paid for it. I decided to ask him if he wanted me to tell her that, since I wasn’t sure how she would respond to his finances. He in fact said he didn’t want her to know. 

I responded and said “I don’t know, I was in the truck”. She responded “whatever, (my name), I’ll just stop asking questions altogether. I just thought it was weird for him. I’m not being judgy. You can stop lying to me”. 

I was stunned and ended up getting into this fight with her via text and am now refusing to talk to her on the phone because she’s pissed at me for something that I somehow ended up in the middle of. 

So am I an asshole? To either my mom for not telling her or my brother for maybe telling her I knew he got it? 

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"AITA for not telling my mom my brother bought a motorcycle?  I (27F) went with my brother (24M) on a trip a few weeks ago to pick up a used motorcycle. He told me he wanted to fix it up and sell it, but also maybe ride it a little. He did this while my mom was out of the country, so we didn’t have to say anything to her. Neither one of us live at home. He’s married with a newborn and I live 2 hours away… I was there watching her house while she was gone. 

Fast forward to today. I’m at work (now back at my home), and she texts me asking if I knew about his motorcycle. I thought “oh he finally told her”. My mom has been weird about motorcycles for YEARS. She doesn’t like them and we knew she was going to be weird about this one. I said “yeah, I went with him to get it”. She then proceeded to ask me how much he paid for it. I decided to ask him if he wanted me to tell her that, since I wasn’t sure how she would respond to his finances. He in fact said he didn’t want her to know.

18,1damv3t,AITA for putting makeup on my sisters kid though she forbid it?,"So my sister growing up was always obsessed with appearances. Not in an unhealthy way, like a lot of women are.

She wore makeup daily, full face. Shaves basically every day of her life. She usually puts a lot of effort into her hair, outfit, etc. This was in direct contrast to me. I wore makeup sparingly, no botox for me, and like to rock out in sweats a lot of the time when she's decked from head to foot. I obviously put in effort sometimes, but if I did as often as her I would... not be able to handle it.

She made fun of me for it a lot growing up, and would tell me how embarassing it was I didn't put in more effort, wear more makeup, try harder, etc.

This was when she was a teen/young adult but I always thought her opinion on that hadn't changed, that she thought it was embarassing I didn't give a shit.

But she has a kid, who I adore and love. She is 7 and loves me more than anyone and anything. She was spending a few days at my house while my sister and her husband went traveling.

A while ago I was putting a little makeup on my sister's kid because it was fun and she asked. My sister got upset with me. It wasn't bad, but she told me not to do it again.

She got teary eyed and said she wants her daughter to experience her childhood without having to stress about how she looks all the time. She said that day would come, but now she wants her to be happy. She doesn't want her to be more grownup by wearing more grownup clothes/putting on makeup, etc. She basically said she doesn't want her daughter to end up like her. 

Which is shocking. I never knew she felt negatively about the whole thing but I was also put off because she was one of those people that for years would shame women's appearance (mostly me but others too) for not being perfect. I'm glad she turned around but still. 

I also thought this was so silly, if I'm honest. My sister and I wore makeup as young kids and it was fun, just dress up. It has nothing to do with her aging too fast, she is 7.

While my neice was staying with me she was begging me to let her dress up/try on makeup. She begged so much I gave in. I didn't really think my sister would make that big of a deal about it if she found out, but I was wrong.

One of our cousins took a picture of her and showed it to my sister, thinking it was a cute photo. Well, she blew up at me, saying that I did something she said not to do. I told her it wasn't a big deal, she was being controlling, she's a child, let her dress up? I told my sister she is projecting her issues onto her kid. I really think that's true.

19,1dams16,AITA for hiding my uncles belongings.,"AITA for hiding my uncle's belongings?

So this situation is being brought up again because my cousin was wishing my dad a happy birthday, and she is still mad about what I did.
Let me preface this by saying, I love my uncle (62M). He's always had the same interests as me (F18). 


When I was a sophomore in high school, he was visiting for a couple days because he was a truck driver getting a new load ready for his next job. When he came in, we were laughing and joking, but he looked off, I didn't notice anything severe, but he did ask if he looked weird because something on his face wasn't adding up. I say no, but he leaves with my dad, and my dad points out, one of his eyes were drooping. He had a stroke in his sleep, and went to the hospital, and had a stroke again. I don't know what kind of indestructible alien he is that he survived, but he did, and he was talking. He just wasn't himself as much, anymore. His motor functions were stalled, and his memory was delayed. He had all his things at the house, and his daughter came up north from Georgia to New Jersey, to fly home. I hate his daughter. She's on older than me by about 20 years, and she and her mother are massive gold diggers who treat my uncle like poop.


Ever since she was young and her mom divorced my uncle. So when she came, my uncle begged to stay with us, but he left reluctantly because her mother offered to take care of him. On the night before his discharge, she asked if I seen his wallet, and not the millions of other important things he brought with him, like his rig keys that his company was asking for. I took his bag and gave it to her but kept his wallet because I knew the taking care of him was not true. In reality,hey would call and check in on him in his apartment , but never was actually there. I sent his wallet to  Georgia,and he called me and thanked me for sending his wallet.


When she found out I had his wallet, she called my dad upset because I lied to user about the wallet, so I told her the truth that I know h how her and her mom got down as people, and I wasn't going to give my uncles wallet to people who I had no doubt in my mind would steal from him. He has her and me in his will, and it's a hefty inheritance that I don't want to collect yet, but her and her mom have done dangerous things like let him operate vehicles on his own, and he's crashed multiple times.
She tried to argue again. Today. 2 years later.

20,1damn1k,AITA for nor offering a coworker a plate of food for one of our other coworkers,"This is probably a pretty light AITA compared to others, but I'm feeling guilty about it all the same. 

The company I work for does biweekly barbecues in the summer months, this will be my 4th summer doing them and I made some changes from the lady I took over for. One of them being setting aside food for our weekend security guy. He comes in a couple hours after the barbecue ends, so I'll make him a plate of food, cover it and put it in the fridge. 

We have a couple people in our office that are field workers, but come to the office almost daily to check in and talk with their department. And then we have a couple people who work majority in the office, that sometimes go out into the field

 After their manager noticed I was setting aside food for our security guy, they asked me to start setting aside food for the two field workers. Now, alot of the time I'd do this and they'd show up on time for the bbq and I'd have this food wrapped up with no one to give it to (I'm not standing out there with them so I only hear after the fact they've been there so I can't run them out their plate of food) so this summer I'm only making plates of food for our field workers if I'm asked by their manager to do so. 

I wasn't asked today, infact, I was told he thought they'd all be back on time, Including one of the office staff that happened to be in the field today. So I just made the one plate up for our security guy, and went back to my daily duties. The other office ladies take over the outside portion so that i can get my work done, and one of them came in to make a plate for the normal field worker. I had no idea that one of our office staff was in the field today, and that she wasn't going to be back on time. I was not asked to make a plate for her, and neither was my coworker. 

So she comes back about an hour and a half after the bbq is over, and asked if a plate was set aside for her. I said no. She asked if her manager had set one aside, I said no. She was kind of looking at our security guys plate, and making comments about it and how she was ""shit out of luck"" I assume she was wanting me to offer her the plate. 

Anyway, about 5 minutes before our security guy comes in, her manager comes over and I can hear him picking the plate up and I'm assuming he thought that plate was for her, which was why he didn't ask for one to be made. I'm also assuming he came up to the kitchen because she was back there complaining about it. 

I totally understand the shitty feeling of being left out, but I'm not going to give away another employees food because of poor planning on another person's fault. 

It honestly makes me not want to set aside food for ANYONE. And if this is escalated in anyway to our boss/owner, I'm going to say just that. It sucks that my act of kindness to our security guy would end, but like... where does it stop then?

26,1dam324,AITA for refusing to attend my daughter’s wedding?,"My daughter is planning a wedding with a man she’s been seeing for 5 years. She met him at 20, and he’s 8 years older. We were apprehensive at first because of the age difference, but he was respectful, attractive, smart, solidly employed, and treated our daughter well - so we got over our apprehension. Over the years, this man, (let’s call him John), was a bit of a big spender - we are not. We’re solidly middle class couple, and are financially conservative. Over the years, John has consistently assured us that he’s financially OK - even savvy. He told us he is an avid FIRE movement enthusiast. He let us know about a big 150,000 win on GameStop. He let us know about a 500,000 inheritance - and then another 500,000 windfall from a business sale. He shared his crypto knowledge and wins. He told us about the sale of a property he bought at the bottom of the market that he was selling at a handsome profit because he didn’t like being a landlord. Meanwhile, he slowly became part of the family. Coming to holidays and eventually vacations. My daughter mentioned some red flags, (heavy pot smoker/ time consuming online gamer/ obsessive day trading), but after a few break-ups - he’d always course correct. We’re a few months away from the wedding, when he told my daughter that they’d have to wait 5 years to buy a house. This made no sense. My daughter has saved enough for a down on her own! He wants children within 2 years - so why wouldn’t he want to find a home before then? I pressed her to see the finances before they marry - and sure enough, he was lying. Yes, his retirement is fully funded- but his savings is no where near where it should be based on all his stories and his age/income. He broke down crying, with story after story of where it all went wrong. He rode GameStop back down to nothing - he broke even on the house- he lost the inheritance to bills of a relative- the business sale only netted 1/3 of what he expected - he’s been living above his means (but it’s partially my daughters fault because she enjoyed those dates - right?). Ugh. As conservative spenders, we were perplexed by the Mercedes, the Peloton, and the latest gadgets (gaming systems/$1500 scooter, etc.), and the spacious 2 bedroom apartment (without a roommate to offset costs).  But our daughter would assure us that his plan was to retire at 40, and all his windfalls and smart investing allowed for all the extras. Now that we know the truth, we’re sickened. He blatantly lied - for years - to my husband and I. We wouldn’t have cared if he was a regular guy financially, but feel that he created this facade so we wouldn’t be concerned about his aggressive spending. We feel betrayed, and we feel he’s a horrible con that  can’t be trusted, and that he most likely has a gambling problem. My daughter wants to move forward with the wedding, and we feel it will be the biggest mistake of her life. She feels we’re overreacting. AITA?

Update: it’s postponed! It sunk in last night - and the gravity of 5 years of deception had her reassess. A rough road ahead - but the plan for all of us to reacquaint with this person - and take this slowly. He was part of our family - and I believe we can all benefit from some family counseling to understand what exactly happened here. Thanks Reddit!

27,1dam1fa,AITA for having high standards from my boyfriend (M28) on my (F25) birthday?,"
Last year for my birthday it really felt like my boyfriend didn’t pay attention to anything I asked for. He has always been a lot more laid back with gift giving and doesn’t view it as important, as opposed to me, someone who loves gift giving. I associate it with the special opportunity to show how much you care on an important day. 

Now, last year my boyfriend let me down a bit. Though I’m not sure he sees it that way. For my birthday we went to the city and said I could buy and pick something out I wanted, but for weeks prior I had clarified to him that I much prefer to shop online as 95% of shops I like are on there and don’t have physical stores e.g. Etsy. So as you can imagine I was pretty frustrated by this, even more so when it clicked to me halfway through the day that the plan to go the city was my idea and only made a week prior to my birthday if that. Therefore he hadn’t even considered by birthday before then it seems. Granted he did take me out for a meal while in the city and I did enjoy it. 

This year, I feel like I’ve been very naggy. I keep reminding him of my expectations, and at times when he’s mentioned about getting me gifts from town I’ve been a bit harsh in the sense I’ve reminded him that the stores I like are typically online. He has booked a meal for us for the day and I’m sure I’ll enjoy that but at the moment he thinks I’m being quite unfair with how I’m treating him. I suppose he feels I’m not giving him a chance and I’m being negative. To me, he’s never really wowed me on my birthday apart from our first year together when he got a meaningful gift, and I’m tired of not feeling listened to more than anything. Or even feeling like he doesn’t care enough to pay attention. 

So, AITA or is he? Or are we both? ",Asshole,2024-06-07,"AITA for having high standards from my boyfriend (M28) on my (F25) birthday?

29,1daliqm,AITA for not including my gf in my issues all the time?,"
In my current relationship, I do tend to help my partner out with anything she needs or wants to be done and also shower her with love whenever she succeeds. 

It’s such that I do solve all of her problems and make sure she’s doing great. But for my side I always solve my own problems and make sure I do it by myself or get assistance and expertise all the time. I buy her gifts and whatever she demands. I support her entirely.

I mean she actually doesn’t know regarding my situations most of the time as she gets to know about it whenever I’ve already solved my own problems. So it’s been 2.5 years since I’ve started dating her. I do buy her gifts on occasions or maybe at times when she succeeds in her endeavours. 

Although she has tried to buy me something but as I can easily read her expressions I make it clear to her that if I want something I’ll ask. My feeling is that I don’t really actually want anything from her tbh. And yes she has constantly told me if I need help with my issue she’s ready to help but yeah honestly I tend to solve my own problems by myself. 

And yes there was once an incident where I had mentioned, I was planning to buy a Christiano Ronaldo jersey for the new Portugal kit. She insisted she wanted to buy that for me but I turned her down saying I’ve already pre-ordered it. And also regarding a perfume which I fancied, I mean we were just have a normal convo about things that I like. So I said these are items that had already been ordered. And yeah well she didn’t take it well and got really upset and pissed about it.

32,1dal40c,AITA for hiding money from my parents?,"I (17F) have 3 younger siblings (10F, 10M, and 6F), with another on the way. All of us are from different fathers, minus my youngest sister and the unborn baby, who are from my stepdad, who's been with my mum for about 7 years give or take a few months. I'm essentially raising my siblings by myself, and I know for a fact that when my newest sibling is born, it will be no different. My mum isn't exactly the most hands-on parent, my birth dad unfortunately passed away quite a few years ago and wasn't granted custody before then, I don't even know who the twins' dad is, and my stepdad is an absolute POS. When I say my mum isn't hands-on, I mean she doesn't do anything. And this includes making us food, helping with homework, paying for anything school-related, taking any of us anywhere, quite literally everything. She doesn't even let us stay in the house during the day, she quite literally only lets us in when it gets dark and wants us out as soon as possible in the morning. When I first started looking after my siblings more full-time, it wasn't too hard for me to manage,, but over time it became impossible to get by without paying for things. It's not like we don't have money - neither of my parents work, but get benefits, and I know for a fact they get money from certain other means.

Long story short, this all ended up with me getting a job when I turned 14. When I was about 12 or 13, I made friends with a girl who had recently moved to the area, and over time became really close with her and her family. I used to make pocket money by 'working' on her family's farm, which then turned into a proper job when I was 14. It's a great job not only because of the money, but also because during my work hours where my siblings aren't in school, they can run around with my friend's siblings in a very safe area and I don't have to worry about where they are. My hours have increased ever since I started college, I work 3 full days a week now and part time the other 4 days.

I didn't want my parents knowing because that money is what I need to buy things for myself and my siblings, and they wouldn't let me keep it otherwise. I don't know how they found out, but last night I came home from work with my siblings and my mum immediately confronted me and started telling me I was hiding money from her and my family that could be used to pay for baby things or could be spent on doing the house up. Usually when she gets angry, I just let her yell and it blows over, but then my stepdad got involved and I'd just had enough. I started yelling back, telling them that they're both useless excuses for parents, and it rapidly just got worse from there, and didn't exactly end well.

Mind you I had to drive an hour to put gas in his truck to get him here cause he ran out of gas coming from 2.5 hours away, three days in had to spend another $330 to get his truck out of impound and a new alternator, And gas on multiple occasions with no hesitation to help him get to job interviews and to the soup kitchen to get food(which I told him he didn’t have todo that and he insisted on doing it) for him to just take my change. 

I confronted him this afternoon about it and he admitted to it right away but on the principle that he stole from me(especially while I’m going out of my way to help him) I want him gone which my wife agrees. The sad thing is, I would have told him to have the whole thing if had just asked for it.

35,1dakf7z,AITA? (22F) Getting married without my dysfunctional/unsupportive family around?,"Hey, how's it going, like the title says, I'll be getting married at the end of this month to my lovely partner and its causing some issues. Ever since we got together my family has made no effort to get to know him(excluding my eldest sibling), my mom and brother take jabs at him whenever they can for no reason. My close friends and eldest sibling who have met him have said similar things ex: he seems very sweet and he has my best interest at heart, ect, ect.  My fiance has always been very kind towards my family and in exchange they have just been cold. 

For the record, I have an odd relationship with my family. I'm the only girl, out of 3 boys, my grandparents have always made it very clear they favour my brothers over me. My mom and I were close until she started dating her boyfriend 4 years ago. I've always been the blacksheep, and I'm okay with that.
When my family gathers, its for lunch on Sunday afternoon when my mom and younger brother are in the city. Its always uncomfortable, someone always starts an arguement or my little brother starts insulting me for no reason, my family will get fired up and my moms dogs add an unnecsessary level of chaos to it. Its just an unpleasant experience. 

When I got engaged, I only told my mom and older brother. Right off the hop, they've been unsupportive.. they make comments left and right and have for several months now. I havent even told my grandparents because I have a good feeling I know how theyre going to react.

My fiance and I have come to the desicion to have a small wedding (our 2 best friends, the marriage commissioner, the photographer and us.) and we'll have a dinner with his family at a later date. (His family has been super supportive of us getting married) Now, my mom and older brother INSIST that they be there and are angry with me for not inviting them.

36,1dakdcx,AITA for not hiring an ex-friend?,"UPDATE: looks like I have to share more since folks are curious why we grew apart. Whenever I run an event in town, and she attends, she shows up inebriated and makes a scene, whether it’s yelling or being very touchy with patrons. The last event of this kind I ran 2 years ago, I hired her to talk. She came drunk and ended up sexually harassing 1 of the attendees. I didn’t want to share the is because it seemed unnecessary and I didn’t want to put any incriminating information online. 

I’m a producer in my small town and I’m running an event at the end of the month. 

The end of the event includes a talkback session where a facilitator who will answer questions from the audience. Let’s call the facilitator, Andy. Andy is experienced and trusted in the community. I left it up to them to find a co-facilitator since the person I initially wanted wasn’t available. 

Fast forward to today, Andy reached out and revealed that the co-facilitator she found to accompany them as an ex-friend of mine. Let’s call this ex friend Randy. I asked Andy if Randy knew I was producing the event and they said YES. Randy and I have known each other for 3 years and within the last 2 years have grown apart due to many differences, including her drinking. (For time context, our friendship lasted 1 year before I realized we were in very different places in our lives). Randy has tried to come back into my life and I have continued to keep my distance. 

I called Andy, the original facilitator, and told them that I would need Randy to at least call me and connect since we haven’t spoken since October of last year. 

Randy has not made any attempt to reach out to me or to ask me if it would be OK to be part of my event until today, after Andy told her to give me a call. Randy left me a voice note saying that “she was hoping to be part of the event in a professional context and wants to support me because she loves what I do for the community.” 

With that being said - I do not feel comfortable having Randy at an event that I am producing and paying for her services.  If we were attending the same event or she came as an attendee, I wouldn’t have an issue with it, but I do not want her to be part of my staff.

38,1dajs8b,AITA for moving my tea kettle?,"I (M) live with 4 others in a split-level home. My bedroom is upstairs, the kitchen and living room are upstairs, while the downstairs has my makeshift office for work. One of my roommates (NB) and their partner (F) (who’s unexpectedly living with us but that’s a different story) essentially have chronic pain, so going up and down the stairs is painful for them. The roommates only ever go up and down the full set of stairs to do laundry once a week or so. I'm a big tea lover. I own a temperature-controlled kettle for all my different kinds of teas that can't be brewed with boiling water. I brew multiple cups a day as part of my routine. I let everyone use the kettle, which has been sitting in the kitchen for years.

I recently sustained a knee injury that makes it painful to go up and down the stairs frequently. I currently can't walk without wearing a knee sleeve to keep it stable, so I try to make as few trips as possible during my work day, roughly starting between 8 and 8:30. I've been drinking 2-4 cups of tea a day, so I brought my kettle downstairs to avoid the up and down. I did give everyone a warning about this plan ahead of time, with details. I have managed to conveniently bring everything with me all in one trip: kettle, pot, cup, breakfast, and laptop. This has not sat well with my roommate, who also uses the kettle to brew several times a day. At the end of my workday, I bring it all back upstairs, and everyone else to use the kettle if they'd like. It should be noted that I’m not stopping people from using the kettle when it’s downstairs with me.

My roommate has asked to keep the kettle upstairs until 9 or 10, when I can go grab it, until we can find another kettle to keep upstairs. I really don't want to do that, as going up the stairs is what makes it painful for me. I have not suggested they bring it to me for obvious reasons.

I should also state that they said they use the kettle to boil water, so I suggested using the pot & stove method to boil water, but they said it takes too long, specially on our crappy stove. Today I learned that boiling to them means heating up, not necessarily boiling the water every time.   
  
They also said that I'm not being considerate of their pain, and I admit that even though I'm in pain, it is on just one body part. This situation only comes up because until recently, the kettle has been upstairs the whole time, and we actually have a kettle. But what if we didn’t?

39,1dajqcg,AITA for accusing my roommate of stealing my AC unit?,"I (24F) sublet a room in a 5 bedroom home with 4 other roommates. One of the other roommates, Kate (26F), is the daughter of the property owner. Kate also acts as the property manager. Both of us are in university so our schedules are quite busy and we don't interact often but when we do it's always been friendly. Kate has a strong personality but we've gotten along fine.

Kate is currently in the process of moving into a new place down the street. I will be moving into her room when she leaves, as the person who normally rents my room is returning at the end of the month. 

Kate's room is on the second floor of the house and can get quite warm in the summer so she has a window air conditioning unit. A few days ago, Kate asked if I'd like to buy the AC unit from her, as it won't fit into the window of her new house. It's a nice AC unit and I was happy to not have to find my own so I agreed and paid her for the AC unit later that day. 

A few days later, as I'm driving home, I get a text from Kate. She tells me that she mis-measured the window in her new place and that the AC unit actually will fit so she came back to get it. I get home and go upstairs to the room I'm about to move into and see that the AC unit is already gone.

I am not impressed. In my mind, I paid for this AC unit, ownership of it has transferred to me, and she can no longer just walk in and take it back. Like, if you sold it on facebook marketplace or something you wouldn't just go and take it back because you measured wrong! That would be theft! At the end of the day it's not that big of a deal, I can find another AC unit, but I feel like she overstepped by just taking the AC unit back without at least asking me if that was ok. If she had explained the situation to me, I probably would have let her have it back.

I text her all of this in response and her reply was basically ""sorry, I thought you'd understand because we're friends"". I reply that that typically people treat each other with more consideration when they're friends. She continues to dig in, claims she's too stressed out to be on top of everything right now, basically berates me for not being more understanding, and clearly doesn't think she's in the wrong or understand why I'm upset. She hasn't paid me back yet but states that she'll just take the cost of the AC unit off of next month's rent, as she collects rent on behalf of the property owner.

I know she's under a lot of stress (she's in med school) with the move and everything but I don't think that excuses her actions. I'm under a lot of stress too with school, moving spaces, etc! I'm not going to have to see her around much anymore but I feel like I've torpedoed the friendship by suggestion that she stole the AC unit from me. I've been seething about this all day and am wondering if I'm overreacting.

40,1dajpw1,AITA for learning new skill as a friend?,"Me and a very close friend of mine talk daily about jobs, life, the usual. I was out of work for over 6 months last year with my career I'd been doing for over 10 years coming to and end and eventually finding a job working for not much above minimum wage but for a government position. My friend is in a fairly well paid position but wasnt enjoying it and looking for a career change or move different position within her company. We sat down together a lot scrolling job sites for her, working out what direction she wanted to go in and what skills or qualifications she needed for them. 

Another friend of hers told her they changed careers into coding and was completely self taught through a website called ODIN, in which they spent a few years learning before getting a position and going from there. This really appealed to her since was something she could do in her own time whilst keeping her well paying job she had now. She got into it, had friends helping her, I thought it was fantastic for her and although she struggled in places she was doing great.

In my own life I realised this just above minimum wage job wasnt the new career I wanted and needed to be a bit more ambitious with my life. My younger brother being a coder and my previous career being a graphic designer who had dabbled in web design, I thought this could be something great for me aswell.

I made an account and got to doing some everday. I tried talking to her about it thinking it would be really nice to have some to bounce off and help each other if we were stuck. After a few conversations I realised she really didnt have any interest in talking to me about it, I put it down to her not being as into it as I thought and some department moves on the horizon for her at work causing her to lose interest and didnt talk to about it more.

Been about 3 months later still talking everday about her career and she's on the brink of having a big promotion and department change she's dreamed of. I hadnt mentioned and she doesnt ask about this ODIN or how its going for me. Bought this up to her and caused an argument. 

She states it was her thing and that she wanted 1 thing to be hers and hers only. Said why couldnt I come up with this idea before and me suddenly doing it at the same time and the exact same course as her was the reason she stopped doing it.

I'll be honest... I didnt even consider this when I started, it was something I thought we'd do quietly in the background of our lives but having someone there doing it alongside me so we could support each would be nice for us both.

She got into it, had friends helping her, I thought it was fantastic for her and although she struggled in places she was doing great.

In my own life I realised this just above minimum wage job wasnt the new career I wanted and needed to be a bit more ambitious with my life. My younger brother being a coder and my previous career being a graphic designer who had dabbled in web design, I thought this could be something great for me aswell.

I made an account and got to doing some everday. I tried talking to her about it thinking it would be really nice to have some to bounce off and help each other if we were stuck. After a few conversations I realised she really didnt have any interest in talking to me about it, I put it down to her not being as into it as I thought and some department moves on the horizon for her at work causing her to lose interest and didnt talk to about it more.

Been about 3 months later still talking everday about her career and she's on the brink of having a big promotion and department change she's dreamed of. I hadnt mentioned and she doesnt ask about this ODIN or how its going for me. Bought this up to her and caused an argument. 

She states it was her thing and that she wanted 1 thing to be hers and hers only. Said why couldnt I come up with this idea before and me suddenly doing it at the same time and the exact same course as her was the reason she stopped doing it.

I'll be honest... I didnt even consider this when I started, it was something I thought we'd do quietly in the background of our lives but having someone there doing it alongside me so we could support each would be nice for us both. 

So reddit, AITA for learning a new skill as a friend and not considering how it would make her feel?

45,1daiwf9,AITA: Caught a Spider in a glass that was her favorite,"Today my gf asked me to come take care of a spider for her. She has a huge fear of them and I don't really mind them. So of course I usually take care of these things. 

This on was a ""bigger"" one like maybe the size of a quarter, including legs. So not huge. But big enough to freak her out. She points it out, and I see a cup on my night stand. An old wine glass that I believe was gifted to her by her mother. I get it, that was probably not the best cup to grab. But I mean it was right there its made out of glass and I just didn't think about it. So I capture the guy and flush him away. Even though I tried to just take him outside, but she is not ok with that. They must die. Apparently. 

Anyways she finds out which cup I'm using and throws a fit. Starts saying she will have to throw aware her favorite cup because of this and how could I. Stating that I know how much she hates spiders. (which I do) But! I also know my gf has legit worked in a science lab for many years so ALSO understands that glass.. can be cleaned. Very well, and that glass is essentially completely resistant to all things. So a few spider feetsies touching the glass, albeit again I should have used a different glass, it wont cause any harm. We can put the dish in the wash and there will be zero trace of any spice lingering. 

She looks like she is on the verge of tears. Before explaining this to her I confess to her I am sorry for grabbing that cup. I should  have grabbed something different. She claims I am not sorry, and I just don't understand. I told her I do understand her fears. I AM sorry for the mistake but I also tell her I think she is taking this a little far and being unreasonable. There is now tension between us. I've apologized multiple times.

I understand phobias. I get that people can has fears. Even irrational fears. But the spider is gone. I'm legit trying to put myself in her shoes. I'm trying to think of a situation where I could understand her position, but all I can think of is... If I had a ""favorite cup"" idc if its used to scoop, you know what, out of a toilet.

46,1dai39l,WIBTA for telling my (28F) roommate (29F) her boyfriend can't stay over? ,"My (28F) roommate (29F) started dating this guy (23M) 3 months ago. We immediately set some ground rules as neither of us have been in a relationship since we started living together 6 months ago. Obviously the main rule was no ""adult activity"" in any shared spaces, but I also told her that I was not comfortable with him staying the night until I got to know him better. 

  
At the time of this discussion, she seemed very understanding and was in agreement that he would not be staying over until we were more familiar with each other. I expressed that I did not want a man who is a stranger to me to be staying the night and sharing spaces until I was comfortable around him. Since they started dating and we had that discussion I have met him one time. He seemed nice and fine, but two hours spent with him is not enough. She has not invited me to hang out with them since and I don't feel it is my responsibility to arrange time with her boyfriend.

  
Since then she has been mostly staying at his place. He also has a roommate but she is pretty good friends with him, too, and she has never told me she has a problem staying at his place. Also, he *has* stayed the night at our place on nights that I was not at home. I am in no way trying to keep her from spending time with him, just asking her to respect my boundaries. 

  
So last night, she told me that she wants him to start staying the night during the week. She said she does not like staying at his place because ""he works too early and so \[she\] has to get up too early"", but that if they don't spend nights together she hardly gets to see him. She told me his work schedule and if he stayed the night we would both be getting ready for work at the same time in the morning, in our one bathroom apartment. When she asked me, she implied that her boyfriend thinks I am being ""unfair"" because he ""hardly gets to stay at \[our\] place"". 

I don't think it's unreasonable for me to not want to share my space with a stranger (to me), especially in the morning when I have a pre-work routine and will have to worry about being decent for someone else in my own home. I was in a situation when I was in undergrad where my roommate at the time had her boyfriend stay every single night to the point that he was basically another roommate and I hated it. 

I told her that I needed time to think about it but I know that I am going to tell her no because I still hardly know her boyfriend. I am not trying to be unfair, I am just setting boundaries that I think are perfectly reasonable. The only reason I am even posting this is because I vented to my sister and she said I was ""being kind of crazy"". I am not trying to be an asshole, but would I be if I told her her boyfriend can't stay the night  yet?

My two daughters are 19 and 14. Shortly after getting divorced, I lost my job due to Covid layoffs. I went from a good salary (but not rich good), to being self-employed at age 50 after 17 years as an employee, starting again from scratch after using my savings to buy out the family home from my ex-wife. My new wife is also self-employed and we both work long hours to make it work, especially with two households to run. We travel back and forth between homes and try to parent together when we can.
My daughters and I live the marital home, their mother lives close-by, the daughters go back and forth on an equal time basis. We share all expenses. The elder daughter is just graduating private fee-paying high school.
Things have been difficult, starting again, but I'm just about managing it after a difficult first year.
My daughters don't want for anything: they have a nice detached house with garden, the fridge is always full, we have fast internet, a big tv, Netflix and Disney, they both have their own phones. They have clothes, albeit not luxury brands. Recently I started giving them a 30 euro per month allowance for miscellaneous expenses, to teach them about saving up for things they want.
Recently the younger daughter asked the elder daughter if she wanted to halves to replace a controller of the Nintendo Switch. The elder daughter refused and said as it was a gift from me, I should pay to replace it. it's 80 euros for an original, but I found a compatible one on Amazon. The younger daughter said that those probably wouldn't work as well and might break.
At this point, both of them started to say that money worries were giving them anxiety, that I always say no to them and they don't have things other kids have. The elder one complains that I make her feel guilty about not having a job, and that it's my responsibility to provide for things. The younger one agreed and said she was too afraid to ask for anything. The elder one said that I should not talk about money with them as it makes them feel bad and gives them anxiety, that I should just say yes or no.
I am trying to make them understand that I have to work really hard, often 12+ hours a day, just to pay the mortgage, pay school fees, clothe them and drive them around. After this argument I said they were ungrateful, needed to be less entitled and said I wouldn't pay extra to replace the console after all, they have to either save up their allowance or get a job (the older one, the younger one can't in the country we are in until she is 16).

I'm a divorced man (51), newly married again, but don't live full time with my new wife as we both have 50% custody of our teenage children whose other parents live 200 miles apart.
My two daughters are 19 and 14. Shortly after getting divorced, I lost my job due to Covid layoffs. I went from a good salary (but not rich good), to being self-employed at age 50 after 17 years as an employee, starting again from scratch after using my savings to buy out the family home from my ex-wife. My new wife is also self-employed and we both work long hours to make it work, especially with two households to run. We travel back and forth between homes and try to parent together when we can.
My daughters and I live the marital home, their mother lives close-by, the daughters go back and forth on an equal time basis. We share all expenses. The elder daughter is just graduating private fee-paying high school.
Things have been difficult, starting again, but I'm just about managing it after a difficult first year.
My daughters don't want for anything: they have a nice detached house with garden, the fridge is always full, we have fast internet, a big tv, Netflix and Disney, they both have their own phones. They have clothes, albeit not luxury brands. Recently I started giving them a 30 euro per month allowance for miscellaneous expenses, to teach them about saving up for things they want.

49,1dah0mp,AITA for canceling plans after my friend rescheduled 2-3 times?,"
A work friend and I made plans to meet June 5th. About two weeks ago she texted me and said something came up and asked if we could meet June 4th instead, I said sure no problem.
She texted me last Friday and asked if we could meet June 7th instead after work. She got off at 11 and I would get off at 13 and would meet her when she was got off. 

Last night she texted and asked if we could meet on our lunch break. I got confused and thought I had gotten it wrong so I asked to be sure whether we were gonna meet during lunch break or after work. 

She said because she has so much to do after work it would be better to meet during lunch. That she could meet after work but would rather want to go straight home. She could make an exception but again would rather go straight home after work or meet for little while when she got off. 

That rant about how she has so much to do made me feel like a burden, and honestly annoyed she rescheduled once again. 
I told her that we didn’t need to and for her to just go home, in which she responded “something you want to tell me”. 
We got into a little argument and just ended up not meeting up. 

That “something you want to tell me” felt so disrespectful and annoyed me even more. 
I’m always the one that has to follow her schedule when we are making plans and the one time I don’t it turns into an argument. 

I understand she’s packed and has a lot on her plate, but saying she prefers to just go home hurt. 

Edit: I definitely should’ve added this, she’s traveling in a week and getting married in about two weeks. 
Understandably she has a lot going on, but I would much rather she just tell me she can’t at all instead if going back and forth like this.
It feels like she expects me to just stay available when she needs me

50,1dagv9v,AITA for calling out my housemate and withholding money,"TL;DR: My housemate uses our shared goods without replacing them, controls the heating, makes us pay for it, shouts at people, and plays the victim. When confronted, they accuse us of attacking their character. I'm questioning if I did the right thing by standing up to them.

---

I've lived with this housemate for a couple of years, though they were traveling for six months. Before they left, they constantly used shared items like spices, toilet paper, and sauces without replacing them. They broke an item and refused to replace it, saying, “I’m going away, so why would I replace it?” They saved up £12k for traveling while being stingy with household items.

Since returning, they've continued using shared items without replacing them, like our £7 olive oil, which they replaced with a £2 bottle of vegetable oil. They had friends over who used tons of toilet paper, but they hadn't bought any in four months. When confronted, they get defensive and hostile, even screaming at my girlfriend and making her cry.

My girlfriend has been the one keeping the house clean, but he leaves filth everywhere. When she confronted him, he said, ""I appreciate you cleaning, it benefits me, but I’m not going to do it.""

He constantly turns on the heating, costing us a fortune, and even hid the thermostat in his room. When my girlfriend refused to pay the full WiFi amount due to this, he said, “You can’t just not pay for something you use.”

We went four days without toilet paper because we insisted he buy some. Eventually, he bought four rolls and then left for work for 3 days saying, “Why would I buy more when I’m not going to be here to use them?”

Recently, I calmly told him I’d deduct money from the WiFi payment due to his use of our items. He got defensive, denying his usage and accusing me of being hostile. He insists he has no money but spends on climbing, golfing, and other activities.

In a text, I reiterated my discomfort with sending money while he uses our stuff without replacing it. I also called out his behavior towards my girlfriend. He accused me of escalating things and attacking his character.

He often complains about the house dynamic and avoids resolving issues, turning discussions into arguments. He also makes inappropriate advances towards women and has been called out by others for his behavior.

Despite multiple attempts to address these issues, he remains defensive and accuses me of being unreasonable. I've tried to be lenient, but his behavior has pushed me to stand up for myself.

I need to keep this post short, but there is so much more. He’s repeatedly tried to make me feel guilty for finally calling out his bullying, narcissistic behaviour, which many people have also pointed out.

Am I the asshole for confronting him about these ongoing behaviours, saying he’s taken advantage of us, and having to go after the way he interacts with people and that he is known to be difficult and selfish?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"AITA for calling out my housemate and withholding money TL;DR: My housemate uses our shared goods without replacing them, controls the heating, makes us pay for it, shouts at people, and plays the victim.

51,1daghrj,AITA for refusing to share my birthday with my stepmother?,"My stepmother's birthday is the day after mine. Since my father started dating her (about 10 years ago), I've been expected to share almost every celebration we make for my birthday with her. I was fine with it because I was in my early 20s and had other people to celebrate with (namely, my mom and my friends), but it still bothered me that my dad and I couldn't have our own thing.

I'm married with two kids (8M and 3F), and we have a little tradition. Because I was born in the second half of June, there is usually a Pixar movie playing in theaters. Every year on my birthday, we go to the movies to watch it and then have dinner together. 

We've been doing this since my son was three (though we watched the movies at home in 2020 and 2021). This year, we're watching ""Inside Out 2"". It will be my daughter's first time joining us (she just started sitting through movies), so we're all very excited.

I'd never told my father or stepmother about this tradition. Last week, while we were visiting them, my kids told them we'd be going to the movies for my birthday, and I ended up explaining everything.

The next day, my father and stepmother called me to tell me they were paying for the whole family (me, kids, husband and both of them) to go to the movies and have dinner, just like I'd planned.

It was obvious they intended to celebrate my stepmother's birthday at the same time. They referred to it as ""our birthdays"" and suggested her favorite place for dinner.

I told them that while I understood it was close to her birthday as well, this is a tradition intended to only celebrate mine, and I prefer to enjoy it with my children and husband. As such, I prefer to pay for myself and would appreciate it if they didn't join us.

They're both very upset. My father called me entitled for refusing to celebrate my stepmother's birthday as well as mine, and said I'm sending a terrible message to my kids by refusing to share.

I feel like I'm too old to be acting like this over my birthday, but I don't want to share this tradition with her.

53,1dagc7i,AITA for letting my daughter quit her team.,"My (16f) daughter Zoe loves BB. She plays on her HS team and does AAU on the off season. Most of her HS teammmates are on her AAU team.

Zoe came to me yesterday stating that she wanted to quit AAU. I knew she was having issues with some of the girls but she said last weekend’s game made her realize that she just doesn’t want to play with the AAU team anymore. It’s to much drama and it’s making her not wanting to play anymore.

I called her father ( who was at work) she spoke to him and then afterwards she told me that she definitely wants to quit. I contacted the coach thanked her for the opportunity of letting Zoe play on the team but at this time Zoe would be taking a break from AAU.

Later on when I spoke with her dad  he said  I should have made her “tough it out” and she should “push through any issues “ . He wasn’t happy that I let her quit. I told him I’m not going to have her miserable.

The issue with last weekend game:
3 of the girls snuck out of the hotel room to  meet up with #3 gf and to party. The came back to the hotel room late at night drunk/high banging on Zoe’s door. She got up looked out the peephole and didn’t see anyone & went back to bed. They begin banging on the door again.

Zoe’s roommate got up and let them in.Zoe’s roommate aggravated from being woke up began to have words with girl #2 that almost turned physical. The next morning all 3 girls plus GF turned on Zoe and said all this could been avoided if you would have just let us in the room the first time. The coach had to get in between them & then scolded Zoe for not letting them in last night when they first knocked. ( The coach is #1 mom & #3 Aunt, girl #2 is the gf of #1)

My husband and I have had words over this. He thinks it’s an AH move to just let her quit. I should have let her push through the season. 

Edit: Because some people have asked what BB and AAU are.
BB is basketball, AAU is the Amateur Athletic Union (travel ball). I pay a fee for her to play on a team. They travel around different cities and states playing against other teams in tournaments.

I got pregnant (birth control failure) young. I kept the baby, but me and my then-boyfriend “Leo” broke up over it.

He has only recently met Maya. 

Leo and I are throwing Maya a birthday party, and Matt will not be attending. Apart from the fact that Leo’s family will be there, I don’t think it’s appropriate as Matt doesn’t have a place in Maya’s life at this stage, not to mention this party is to celebrate her, not to try and introduce Matt to various family members and mutual friends on mine and Leo’s. The whole thing would be unnecessarily tense on top of trying to manage small children running around. Matt said he was hurt initially but accepted my decision. 

But apparent he talked to his sister “Whitney” about it, and she has opinions. We were at a dinner party at her house a couple of days ago and she mentioned how she thought it was weird that I was hosting Maya’s party with Leo, especially since I didn’t want Matt there. She went on about how we clearly didn’t have “boundaries” and that her boyfriend wouldn’t be cool with her and her ex acting like a unit in front of family, friends, and their kids. This got on my last nerve because seriously, I don’t really know this woman and here she is with opinions that no one asked for.

Your situation is not similar or preferable to mine, and I’m not likely to want your advice”. Things were pretty awkward after that. 

Matt is pissed off I insulted his sister because she is extremely touchy about the incident with her ex. He said she was just trying to help and offer a different perspective.

56,1dag8ij,AITA for not giving my brother money from an emergency fund set up for him?,"I(36f) set up 3 savings accounts in my name that I put money into for my 3 brothers. I started doing this shortly after finding out at  18 my parents set-up similar emergency accounts for only my sister and me in case of divorce or needing to make a hasty exit from a  relationship and had been putting money into them our entire lives.

They did not have accounts set up for my brothers and when asked, they said they wouldn't need the help if they got divorced or didn't need to worry about abusive spouses. I thought that pretty unfair, especially considering my dad's own brother had to sleep in his car and couch surf for months after his divorce and other male family members that had it just as rough as some of my aunts.

They did not have accounts set up for my brothers and when asked, they said they wouldn't need the help if they got divorced or didn't need to worry about abusive spouses. I thought that pretty unfair, especially considering my dad's own brother had to sleep in his car and couch surf for months after his divorce and other male family members that had it just as rough as some of my aunts.

57,1dag23p,AITA for how I proposed to my fiancé,"I (20 m) proposed to my partner (20) a week ago. A little bit of backstory. My partner and I have known each other for about 10 years, and we have always been very good friends. A couple years ago we decided to start dating. It was on and off for a bit but I finally pulled my shit together, hopped on the high horse and worked on myself to better our relationship. We’ve been going steady for 2 years and I decided to pop the question. Now I’m making around $52k a year so I was able to save some cash for a good vacation to a place we have always wanted to visit. I put a lot of thought into how I would propose to my partner; The Ring wasn’t a diamond but it was made out of an Amethyst they gave me when I was younger, and an obsidian ore cut into a ring. Both the minerals were put into a ring form (the amethyst being ground into tiny crystals and embedded in the obsidian ring).

After I proposed to them, they told me with her own words: “Thank you for proposing to me in private, I think I would’ve had a breakdown if there were people around. I love you and can’t wait to get married to you.”

Now how I proposed to them wasn’t the flashiest or most profound thing ever. I proposed to my now fiancé in our hotel room. I spiced it up by putting roses on the ground, and proposing to her when she got back from a tour of the resort we were at. She has always told me that she’s wanted a private proposal and that’s what I took into account when planning this proposal. They cried when they saw the ring because they thought it “Was the most beautiful thing they have ever seen in their life (quoting from their own words).”

After revealing the way I proposed to my parents, they have said that how I proposed was “tacky” and “cheap”. Yes I have explained to them that my fiancé was very happy with how I proposed, but they just won’t let up that I need to redo the proposal and have it be a public, and grand occasion. They started bringing into the fact that I’m going to get married. Now I see marriage as the beginning of the journey, while my parents see it as the ending of the journey together. We clearly have different views, but I can’t help shake that they may be right about my proposal.

I’ve told my partner about what my family has said, and they are already up in arms in defending me and how I proposed. This has caused a schism in the family, where multiple members of the family are saying that I proposed correctly, while others are arguing I was being cheap. I plan to sit down the family and talk to them, but I honestly don’t know who to side with.

3 years ago I was briefly engaged, we ultimately called it off before making it down the aisle. I had gotten far enough in the planning process to where I did purchase a dress. It was an expensive purchase and I am still obsessed with it, so I ended up keeping the dress in the hopes that I would get married one day.

Well fast forward to now, I am with a new guy and we just got engaged. When discussing budget, I told him we had a bit of leeway because I didn't have to buy a dress. He was pretty upset when I explained, saying he didn't want me to get married to him in a dress that I had bought while envisioning wearing it to marry my ex. It really wasn't like that at all, I bought the dress because I liked how it looked on me, not really picturing my fiance at all. He refuses to believe this and is insisting I buy a new dress. I think this is silly and a waste of money, especially since any new dress I bought would look very similar. He hasn't seen the dress I currently have, and I'm seriously considering lying and saying I bought a new one while wearing the old one, but don't want to start our marriage off on a lie.

So AITA for wanting to wear the dress I already have to my wedding against my fiancé's wishes?

The older dog, Ky, was a little mean in his childhood, but he was trained out of aggression and he was always genuinely a pretty chill dog. However, the second dog, Mi, is awful. We got her two years ago from an outdoor breeder, and ever since she was spayed she's been the most aggressive, spiteful little creature ever. I love her, I think she's very cute and sweet when she is being nice, but 70 percent of her time is taken up purely by screaming at Ky and fighting him. She's incredibly territorial, and every time Ky is so much as in her vicinity she runs over just to snarl and yell at him for laying down in his crate in the living room. Every time my parents come home from work, she ends up fighting him.

This morning, I woke up and Mi and Ky were once again fighting. According to my mother, she had been trying to hand feed Mi some kibble when she suddenly whirled around to scream at Ky, who was sitting in his crate. The two started fighting again. Now, for some reason, when Mi is angry, she won't just try to snap at Ky, she'll bite literally anything in the vicinity.

Countless times in the past I have never been able to wake up in the morning and I always feel very guilty about it.

It always makes our day start shitty and I try to apologize and say my intent but they never want to hear it

I went to therapy and brought it up which was always choked up to my ADHD or that I'm not going to bed earlier or that I'm drinking too much caffeine. I started going to bed at 11, which gives me an 8 hour sleep, and I totally cut out caffeine. I still never remember turning off my alarms, even when I hide them in my room.

This all escalated this morning when my girlfriend tried waking me up for 30 minutes until she gave up and went to school without me. When I woke up it was already way past the time I was supposed to be there. My girlfriend says I'm breaking promises that I'll be up early with her, which I guess I am, but I feel like it's always out of my control. I make promises because I always am naive and believe that I'll just be able to wake up.

Countless times in the past I have never been able to wake up in the morning and I always feel very guilty about it. During high school my mom would always have to come into my room every 5 minutes to get me up, she'd also rip my blankets off of me and spray water on my face which would always do the trick. The thing is, I don't remember turning off my alarms in the morning or being woken up. I always just remember my mom or gf waking me up sounding pissed because we're gonna be late. It always makes our day start shitty and I try to apologize and say my intent but they never want to hear it

I went to therapy and brought it up which was always choked up to my ADHD or that I'm not going to bed earlier or that I'm drinking too much caffeine. I started going to bed at 11, which gives me an 8 hour sleep, and I totally cut out caffeine. I still never remember turning off my alarms, even when I hide them in my room.

This all escalated this morning when my girlfriend tried waking me up for 30 minutes until she gave up and went to school without me. When I woke up it was already way past the time I was supposed to be there. My girlfriend says I'm breaking promises that I'll be up early with her, which I guess I am, but I feel like it's always out of my control. I make promises because I always am naive and believe that I'll just be able to wake up. I've been told by my mom to reframe my thoughts when I wake up, but the problem is that I don't remember even being conscious, I don't know how I'd be able to reframe my thoughts if I'm not aware that I'm awake. I both feel unfairly criticized but also I understand how frustrated they are. To them, waking up in the morning is easy. My girlfriend is still upset at me and it's 2 hours after this happened.

65,1dadh7e,AITA for refusing to fold towels when I do the laundry? ,"When my husband and I got married in 2013, we were both working full-time jobs plus significant overtime. We split household chores 50/50. The two most relentless chores (dishes and laundry) were easy to split because he hates doing dishes, and I hate doing laundry. 

When he first did the laundry, he would put everything away as I was used to (hangers for clothes, folded sheets, etc) but all towels were simply thrown into the appropriate cabinet un-folded. When I asked him about this, he said that he doesn't fold towels because nobody sees them for very long anyway. I thought about this and decided I agreed. I asked him to fold the few that guests might access like the two hand towels in the bathroom, but otherwise, I don't mind grabbing an un-folded towel before a shower. I moved on, and that was our acceptable standard of care for about a decade.

About two years ago, my husband replaced his full-time job with a small business in the same industry. He does most of the work, with only one part-time employee to help. He schedules his jobs as needed and, as such, can moderate his own workload to his degree of comfort. He likes this freedom and has expressed that he is not interested in growing the business past this point. This business quickly began to bring in over 400% as much as we earned as a couple, and my husband asked if I would be interested in returning to the home so that we could reduce our overall workload, as I was bringing in a pretty small portion of our income at that point. 

Although I was uncomfortable with giving up my career entirely, I did agree that it was silly for us to be under time constraints. I spoke to my employer, who agreed to allow me to work half-time from home if I would be willing to train a replacement for my full-time position, which would take about 6 months. I would then take over the majority of the housework to level out the labor in our relationship. We were all happy with this change. 

Almost immediately after my replacement was hired and I started to train them for this change, my husband suddenly began to fold all the towels. I questioned it casually, and he said he just liked how they fit in the cabinet when they're folded. I brushed it off, not wanting to be paranoid or make any accusations. But now that I'm home, he gets irritated that I do not fold the towels. 

So far, I have refused to do this. It's not a horrible chore to take over, but I feel like the timing is suspicious, and I feel manipulated. Why does the aesthetic value of the 2 seconds the cabinet is open not matter when it's his labor, but suddenly it's my labor, and it's worth the work? 

I can't tell of I'm being petty by not doing this, or if he's being manipulative. To be clear, this is not a pattern, and I do love my husband, but I think he may be subconsciously discounting the value of my labor. AITA?

if I made a condition that my 15M son get and keep a job before I pay for the braces the is asking for? 

My older son had two rounds of orthodontic treatments totaling $13K between 8 and 14 and he did not al ways follow instructions to help headgear on, wear rubber bands, so at 14 I told the doctor to take everything off, I stopped paying and told my son he can continue treatment as an adult on his dime. 
His teeth look good, better than mine, just not orthodontically perfect. 

My younger son feels entitled and doesn’t think he should work, etc. 
Stays in room on phone unless forced to go outside. 
Never wore brand new shoes I bought because it was not Air Jordan brand. 

I want to use the thing he wants to force him to go get a job and keep it. 

The braces are $3550 and the payments will be $110 per month. 

I plan to ask him work and to pay $20 per month towards the braces and if he can’t keep a job I’ll take the braces off and he can do it later on his dime. 
(I’ll likely put the $20 into his minor account to give back to him at 18) 

Would I Be an Asshole for doing this ?

EDIT: I love both my kids the same, just want to show them some accountability. 

Would not jeopardize their health in any way. 

The braces for younger are not medically necessary. 
He has a great smile perfect top row, you can’t tell unless he opens wide. The lower teeth are slightly crowded and not in perfect alignment. 
Of course they the orthodontist will make you feel like shit unless they are absolutely perfect 😄

Does closing a gap in his teeth fall under child abuse if I don’t get braces for that ?

My parents are cool and super supportive, but I’ve only been living with them full time since I turned 18 and got the hell out of my mom’s place.

71,1daaw9h,AITA for yelling at my friends in public ,"AITA for screaming at my friends in public

Me (22F) have been living with my roommate Hana (23F) for a year. We’ve known each other for 5. I introduced her to her current gf, Brianna(21F)—a newer friend of mine—and they’ve been together about 9 months. 

Brianna was over at least 3 times a week for the past 6 months. Usually more. I was fine with this because my gf lives alone and I spent a lot of time at her place. Brianna was dorming and now she’s graduated and has no where to go in the city we live in except back home with her parents 2 hours away. 

Recently, I got a random text from Hana saying that Brianna’s sublet fell through and asking if she could stay at ours. She couldn’t give me an answer for how long and said we could split the water and gas bills three ways but Brianna couldn’t pay rent. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with it but she kept asking me to talk to her about it in person. We did and I still didn’t agree, but nonetheless Brianna has been at the apartment everyday since. 

There’d already been lingering tension because of some inconsiderate/rude things that Hana and Brianna had done to me and my gf and some of my friends. I hadn’t said anything about it prior bc I’ve had negative/traumatic roommate stuff in the past. I just want a stable housing situation and at the end of the day these are some of my closest friends.

I stayed for a week at my gfs because the situation made me so anxious and uncomfortable I didn’t even want to be home. 2 days ago we finally had the big convo and it was hours of me telling them I wish they’d be more mindful, respectful, and polite. They were pretty defensive and didn’t really take accountability for anything. Even if they kinda did, they would back track with an excuse like “I don’t feel like I have to say thank you cuz you just know I mean it”. I was ready to just give up and let Brianna move in (even though she honestly already had) if we could split the bills 3 ways like Hana suggested. She replied “friend to friend I don’t get splitting the bills. It’s not really community oriented but if that’s what u wanna do I’m fine with it”.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"AITA for yelling at my friends in public  AITA for screaming at my friends in public

Me (22F) have been living with my roommate Hana (23F) for a year. We’ve known each other for 5. I introduced her to her current gf, Brianna(21F)—a newer friend of mine—and they’ve been together about 9 months. 

Brianna was over at least 3 times a week for the past 6 months. Usually more. I was fine with this because my gf lives alone and I spent a lot of time at her place. Brianna was dorming and now she’s graduated and has no where to go in the city we live in except back home with her parents 2 hours away. 

Recently, I got a random text from Hana saying that Brianna’s sublet fell through and asking if she could stay at ours. She couldn’t give me an answer for how long and said we could split the water and gas bills three ways but Brianna couldn’t pay rent. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with it but she kept asking me to talk to her about it in person. We did and I still didn’t agree, but nonetheless Brianna has been at the apartment everyday since. 

There’d already been lingering tension because of some inconsiderate/rude things that Hana and Brianna had done to me and my gf and some of my friends. I hadn’t said anything about it prior bc I’ve had negative/traumatic roommate stuff in the past. I just want a stable housing situation and at the end of the day these are some of my closest friends.

I stayed for a week at my gfs because the situation made me so anxious and uncomfortable I didn’t even want to be home. 2 days ago we finally had the big convo and it was hours of me telling them I wish they’d be more mindful, respectful, and polite. They were pretty defensive and didn’t really take accountability for anything. Even if they kinda did, they would back track with an excuse like “I don’t feel like I have to say thank you cuz you just know I mean it”. I was ready to just give up and let Brianna move in (even though she honestly already had) if we could split the bills 3 ways like Hana suggested. She replied “friend to friend I don’t get splitting the bills. It’s not really community oriented but if that’s what u wanna do I’m fine with it”. 

This all came to a head yesterday when the three of us went out together and some unrelated drama came up that led to them throwing me under the bus to someone we all mutually disliked and talked shit on for months. I blew up and screamed “you guys are so selfish! You’re so fucking selfish!” And stormed off. I haven’t spoken to either of them since and the apartment has been tense.

72,1daaqbg,AITA (22F) for getting arguing with my sister (18F) over a cookie?,"My sister (18F) asks a lot of me. I (22F) help her with her homework, whenever she’s stressed, I’m there to help her (sometimes for hours on end), she vents to me multiple times a day and texts me with her frankly useless problems all day (like “should or shouldn’t I get a waffle from the cafeteria?”). There are also many occasions where she forgets to bring her homework, and I have to send photos. Or she’s at school and she’s suddenly wondering where that one thing in her room is and I have to go look for it. I spend hours a week on her, I do a lot of the stuff my parents should do but they don’t. And I think it’s straining our relationship. I’ve set boundaries with her many times, but she doesn’t respect them.

The day before yesterday, she mentioned they might have my favorite cookies in her school cafeteria and asked if I wanted her to bring me one. I said yes. They ended up not having them that day (they only have them once a month or so). Today, I walked into her room and saw 2 cookies, so I said, “OMG, thanks! You got me one!” And she goes, “Oh no, they’re for me and dad.” I asked her why she didn’t get me one because I literally confirmed 2 days ago that I wanted one. She was clearly annoyed that I asked and she said she forgot. 

Would I be pissed about this normally? No. But I’ve been working my ass off for her all week, and she can’t even remember to bring me a cookie. She often forgets to say thank you after I help her with stuff and she doesn’t do the same things for me in return. If I’m stressed or I need help, she might be there for a few minutes but she will quickly grow annoyed and yell at me instead of helping me. 

So I gave her a look, and then she, seemingly reading my thoughts, lectured me about how it’s unkind to expect anything back when I’m helping her with stuff. But it’s not even much to ask. I would’ve paid for the cookie. I just think it’s stupid that I help her with stuff on a daily basis, and she can’t even remember to buy me a cookie. She didn’t apologise for forgetting either. 

I’m not truly upset about the cookie of course. I can live without one. But I feel like our relationship is totally out of balance. I do way more for her than I should. And she does far too little. I do way more
than an average sibling and she does way less. But is that her fault? It’s certainly not her fault my parents don’t accommodate her emotional needs. I suppose it’s not her fault she has less time to help me with stuff. I naturally blame her for ignoring my boundaries regarding this over and over, but did I take it too far? We ended up yelling and arguing about this cookie for a while and she got upset and had less time to study for her test because of it. Was I in the wrong?

She's also pregnant, and we all knew abt it from the start, but they don't have jobs/money to pay for the stuff and I don't want them to move back in(my family home where i currently live only with father, our sister moved away with her fiancee). Our mother passed away a month ago and she also told him that she's not good for him(he also said himself that he thinks like that too???and always asked me for opinion and agreed to them).
For context, I'm 21, he's 32, she's 35(?).
Why I don't like her? Well, she's really rude at times and not so cultured. While our mother was still alive, she was tied to the bed cuz of her sickness, while they were staying at our house at the moment, they made such huge mess but kept it in their room. Mom told her ""could you clean up after yall"" and she replied ""he doesn't clean at my place so why would I do"". I'm sorry, but how can u talk back to somebody's mother, also she's sick...like...
She's generally like that where her responses are passive aggressive, sarcastic and just in general rude. I would be ashamed but maybe that's just me.
It's very important to note that me and my bro are really close as we go out a lot, hang out a lot etc. So I've been in really involved with his life and we have same circle of people. He told me years ago that he values my opinion a lot and especially this year since last year we were together for 80% of the time and the shit we went through...so he know that I'm usually right with my opinions and predictions. He also said a lot of bad stuff abt her and agrees with me, our sis and mother since we all have the same opinion. That's why I'm so angry.
I don't want them moving in into our family home since it's not big enough for a couple and 2 people who want to rest, my life was fairly peaceful and steady but when he returned(after our mother death, he went to work abroad)and proposed to her...I lost it. She doesn't know my opinion on her, I act kind and yk, I try not to show my true emotions so I don't make problems but I don't know what I should do if they move back in.
My sister and father are soft and don't want to say anything to them and we are already used to cleaning up his shit and fixing it for him. His whole life.
When he announced pregnancy I told him how unhappy I was and that she's not the one and that he's rushing. My sister just said ""all we can do is support him bc we aren't choosing and help them out"".

   Our area is holding a two day community yard sale and my children asked if they could participate by have a lemonade stand in front of our house. I agreed to it. We got all set up on our side walk. I moved my car up a little bit  so when traffic comes they can see the sign for the kids stand. This was apparently too close to in front of her house for her liking. 
She comes out of her home screaming at me that I cannot park in front of her house. I told her I did not park Infront of her house. My car was still lined up with our own front yard. I also reminded her that there is no assigned parking and that if it truly is an issue I will move my car ( one car length back) after we were done with our little lemonade stand. She said that wasn't good enough and to move my car immediately or she will call the police. I asked her to give me one valid reason as to why I couldn't park there ( Infront of my own yard)other than because she said so.I also asked if she was participating in the yard sale ( she wasn't).

77,1da9msj,WIBTA if I ask my parents for an equal distribution of chores between me and my brother?,"Just to be clear, my parents are not abusive in any way and I consider myself a very lucky person to have everything I do. My parents have been nothing but supportive and caring towards myself and my siblings. I (17/G) have three siblings, two older brothers who have both moved out and a younger brother (15). 

I don’t have any problems with helping my parents out. I do the majority of the dishes, hoovering, washing clothes, cleaning the bathroom, living room, kitchen as well as doing most of the pet care. I even cook meals when either my parents aren’t home or are just tired. I don’t have a problem with any of this, because it’s honestly not a big deal compared to everything my parents do for me. I don’t have an allowance, but I sometimes help my parents out at work (they own a small business) when it gets busy or extra cover is needed and they give me some money for that. My family often takes small weekend holidays at our caravan but due to our pets (two dogs, two rabbits, one cat) I normally stay home to take care of them all so my parents can relax properly without having to worry about taking the dogs for a walking if it rains (my brother goes with them)

Here’s my problem, I’m the only one of my siblings who helps out my parents. My two older brothers never helped out around the house, and despite them both having their own places and jobs, often ask my parents to buy and deliver their shopping to them. My younger brother is even worse. He helps out with nothing, often makes us late because he doesn’t want to get out of bed and whenever he’s asked to do anything replies with “I forgot” and says it’s not his fault. He doesn’t like school (which is fine) and spends all his time playing videogames with his friends. He’s in the middle of his GCSEs and I honestly don’t know what he’s going to do after as I don’t think he’ll achieve a passing grade in most of his subjects (including English) which severely limits his options.

I want to ask my parents to give some of the things I help out with to my younger brother, even if it’s just him laying the table or something small because I can’t help but feel frustrated that he literally doesn’t help out in any way. He doesn’t even clean his room and it’s either me or my mum who does. I know that if I asked my parents they would agree and ask my brother to help out more but I know that will only lead to stress as he either won’t do it, or do it so badly that someone else has to do it again. 

I don’t think it’s fair that I help out so much when he doesn’t do anything but I also don’t want to stress out my parents and put more of a burden on them. So WIBTA if I asked despite knowing that it will cause more stress for my parents?


",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"WIBTA if I ask my parents for an equal distribution of chores between me and my brother? Just to be clear, my parents are not abusive in any way and I consider myself a very lucky person to have everything I do. My parents have been nothing but supportive and caring towards myself and my siblings. I (17/G) have three siblings, two older brothers who have both moved out and a younger brother (15). 

I don’t have any problems with helping my parents out. I do the majority of the dishes, hoovering, washing clothes, cleaning the bathroom, living room, kitchen as well as doing most of the pet care. I even cook meals when either my parents aren’t home or are just tired. I don’t have a problem with any of this, because it’s honestly not a big deal compared to everything my parents do for me. I don’t have an allowance, but I sometimes help my parents out at work (they own a small business) when it gets busy or extra cover is needed and they give me some money for that. My family often takes small weekend holidays at our caravan but due to our pets (two dogs, two rabbits, one cat) I normally stay home to take care of them all so my parents can relax properly without having to worry about taking the dogs for a walking if it rains (my brother goes with them)

Here’s my problem, I’m the only one of my siblings who helps out my parents. My two older brothers never helped out around the house, and despite them both having their own places and jobs, often ask my parents to buy and deliver their shopping to them. My younger brother is even worse. He helps out with nothing, often makes us late because he doesn’t want to get out of bed and whenever he’s asked to do anything replies with “I forgot” and says it’s not his fault.

78,1da990g,AITA for telling my husband we have different priorities than his 30th birthday?,"I am upset and think my husband is being selfish right now. I 32F am married to Alex 30M. I am currently three months pregnant and this pregnancy has been really hard on me. In the past I have miscarried so we are keeping this pregnancy a secret until ~4 months and will not tell friends and family until then. 

I have awful morning sickness that has let up in the past month, and as I can’t tell anyone it has been hard, but Alex has really supported me in this time. 

Alex’s 30th birthday was Wednesday and I invited close family and friends over and got catering from his favourite restaurant. I can’t cook huge volumes of food for guests or be up on my feet very long and made sure the party was short by throwing it on Sunday, so people would leave early for work the next day. The party for me was tiring and while I wanted to be there for Alex, I was glad when everyone left as I just wanted to go to bed. The morning after Alex said he has fun and I thought that was the end of it.

For his actual birthday on Wednesday, I made him a cake and got him a birthday present. He seemed disappointed and when I asked why he asked me if this was it. I was confused and he said he assumed I was throwing him a big surprise birthday as I knew how much celebrating his 30th meant to him. I told him no his party was what happened on Sunday and that I have been too sick and tired to plan anything bigger. That party alone was a huge effort for me, especially coordinating what worked for everyone else, which happened to be the Sunday and worked out best for me. I got upset called him selfish and have avoided him ever since.

He is upset as for my 30th he planned a big celebration and even invited my college friend from another country. I obviously appreciated his effort and that was the best birthday anyone has ever planned for me, but that’s isn’t possible for me to do for him with my pregnant and I told him we have different priorities now and he said that the baby wasn’t even here yet.

Alex has made in clear in the past he wanted to throw a big birthday for his 30th, but with my pregnancy and him seeing how it affects me day to day, I thought he would be more understanding of the effort I did make and 
be more aware of what is possible for his birthday.

79,1da8l6p,AITA for telling my sister she is not a martyr for staying at home and if I was her husband I would divorce her,"Edit: for everyone who says I don't know how stressful it is to be a mom. I am literally a women with three kids. It's not rocket science  to take care of your kids. Basically every parent that works is still helping their kids with hw and taking them to activities. You don't need to be a SAHM to do that



My sister and her husband have two kids. They are both in school. This whole year she has been complaining  constantly about how hard it is to be a stay at home mom but she doesn't want to go back to work. Even though her husband has been pushing her to do for a while.

The issue is that she doesn't do much compared to her husband. He takes the kids to school in the morning. The kids have come home on the bus in the afternoon. She has a whole day with no kids that she can do whatever she wants. Maintaining the house is like 2 hours a day. That leaves her with abut 6-7 hours of just being there. I was a stay at home parent after I lost my old job for a bit, really it's not that hard when the kids are in school almost all day.

Anyways, she came over yesterday and was ranting. They got into a argument about her picking up more slack or getting a job. I guess this started because he came home to a dirty house and no groceries in the fridge. I asked why she wasn't doing chores or at least getting food and she told me she didn't have time.

I asked if she got a work job and it was a no. I asked what she is doing all day and gave me no answer. She then went on a rant about how he isn't doing enough and her husband is being unfair.

At this point I had enough, I told her she isn't a martyr to be a stay at home mom. That she literally gets everything paid for and can't even both to get food. I told her if I was her husband I would divorce her since she acts more like a kid than a partner

This started our own argument and she is pissed. I personally thinks she needed to here it

80,1da8cwy,AITA for not referring to my dad’s “son” as my brother?,"My dad has an employee, who I’ll call Nik. Nik has worked for my dad for 14 years, and in that time they have developed a father/son bond. My dad calls Nik and I “his kids”, and Nik joins us for family holidays, birthdays, etc., since he has no other family that we know of. 

My boyfriend Alex has always referred to Nik as my brother since I explained the situation, even though I never have. If I talk about Nik I always just say he’s pretty much my dad’s other kid, or I explain the whole situation. Alex has tried to correct me a few times and I’ve corrected him back. I know this is a sore subject for him because he is adopted.

But the thing is, I don’t have a sibling relationship with Nik at all. We get along well but I don’t feel like he’s my brother at all. We have an eight year age gap, and I didn’t meet him until I was 11, and I never lived or grew up with him. I do consider him family and I’d do anything for him the same way he would me but he’s still not a brother to me. I’m just not comfortable with that term. 

I’ve explained to Alex that it is in no way the same thing because he grew up with his parents and siblings, but he still says it makes him feel like I place a lot of importance on “blood” family which makes him feel like I must think he’s not really part of his family. 

This came up again last night when Alex and I were out with his colleagues and one asked if I was an only child and I said yes. Alex then corrected me and said I have a brother, technically. I said technically I don’t, because there aren’t any papers of my dad ever adopting Nik so technically, legally, I’m an only child and told him to leave it alone. 

On the way home, Alex blew up at me, accusing me of valuing blood connections only and saying he feels like I’m invalidating his and other adoptee’s experiences of family. I said my relationship or lack thereof with Nik is not related to his family and he needs to keep his issues to himself. 

He’s now being cold towards me. I don’t think I should feel pressured to pretend I see Nik as a brother when I don’t but I also don’t know if I’m being an AH in terms of my thinking here.

So fast forward to 2023 I graduated and I asked him to give me a down payment as was in the agreement. This was the first time I spoke to him since the divorce. He said he wasn’t giving me anything so I spoke to a lawyer and the lawyer said that he owes me the money regardless of how he feels because of the contract in 2019. So I emailed him the contract and he still refused to pay so I took him to court. After a year of back and forth legal issues I ultimately won the case and the judge said that he has to pay me the amount agreed in the contract plus all legal fees and damages. He refused to sign onto the mortgage and because I wouldn’t be able to get a mortgage on my own he was ordered to pay me enough money to become a cash buyer. This all amounted to 1.1M which required him to sell his house to raise the money. He then called me a selfish AH for inflicting this on him and his new wife and stepchildren since they now have to go onto the rental market and save up a down payment.

82,1da803a,AITA for not agreeing to walk my dad's fiancée down the aisle?,"My dad is getting married in September and a few months ago his fiancée asked me if I would walk her down the aisle. She's not close to her own family and she has no kids of her own. Dad has me (17m) and my two sisters (20f and 15f). Our mom died 8 years ago. So it was just us and dad before his fiancée came into his life and then ours.

I don't really like his fiancée. I accept that my dad does. But she comes across as kinda pushy to me and a little too possessive. She had a ""moment"" when my older sister moved all her stuff out of our house a few months ago so she could take it to her own place. The moment was over my sister asked dad for photos of his and mom's wedding if he had any spares and she was upset that they were still in the house. And the fact my sister wanted to take some. My younger sister and I got upset when all photos of our mom were taken down in the living room and dining room. Dad's fiancée was upset about our reaction and said we should want this to be comfortable for her.

She doesn't like us calling her by her first name and tried to influence us to call her Mami. We both knew that was another word for mom and said no. She said it's not mom though and could be special for us to call her that.

My older sister had a small surgery and she asked dad if he would be able to come and stay with her and drive her back to her place. Dad said he could try and he said to let her know if he couldn't. His fiancée told him she'd do it if he couldn't and my younger sister heard them talk about it so she warned my older sister. So my older sister called back and said that if he couldn't she'd ask our grandma. Grandma ended up going with her and dad's fiancée got upset that she didn't want her there.

Mother's Day was also awkward last year because she expected us to celebrate her. This year was doubly so because the expectation was still there.

I have talked to my dad about it and I have told her as well. But nothing really changed and she got upset (again).

So I said no to walking her down the aisle and I have continued saying no and she continues asking. It's sorta the final few months and she told me how much she wants me to do it because it shows me embracing her into the family and makes her feel supported by not just dad but the other male in the family. I told her I didn't want to do it.

It's become a source of tension. My sisters are on my side and dad has tried to compromise with her by them walking together but it hasn't changed things.

83,1da7sw7,AITA for blowing up at my wife over my daughter's school picture?,"Throwaway and fake names.

I (60M) have been married to my wife (51F) for around 15 years. We also have a beautiful daughter named Hayoung (17F) , who is in her junior year of high school.

Yesterday after school, Hayoung (pronounced Ha-young) came up to me and my wife and showed me her school pictures, both her individual photo and her group/grade photo. They were taken all the way back in February, but they had just arrived today.

I complimented Hayoung and told her how beautiful she looked in the photos, before telling her how proud I was to see her grow up throughout the ages, before showing my wife the pictures of our daughter.

It did not go the way I thought/hoped it would go. Instead of looking at it for a bit before saying something, my wife immediately pointed out to Hayoung that she was looking ""too downward"" at the camera and that her eyes looked strained/forced. I was a bit taken aback at first, but I decided to just keep listening. My wife then said to my daughter that ""she would have to have rehearsals for school pictures with her for next year"", because in my wife's words ""Hayoung still doesn't understand how to properly pose, smile and look beautiful for a school picture"". I was a bit irritated, but I let it slide. What set me off though, was my wife then said ""Hayoung's picture is a fail. Honestly, Melissa looks the prettiest out of everyone."" Hayoung got quiet and said ""I'm gonna be honest, my picture this year is really bad compared to sophomore year.""

I got mad that evening. We had a huge argument in the living room. I told my wife that she was being cruel to our daughter and since school pictures were over, there was no point being so picky over it. My wife retaliated, saying that ""Even Hayoung says that she doesn't like how she looks in her school picture. I was just being honest! I'm only trying to help her!"" She then went into her room and started crying, saying that I don't understand her.

I will admit, I raised my voice while we were having that argument and I'm seriously sitting here questioning myself about whether I was the asshole or not. After our argument, I knocked on Hayoung's door and I could tell by her expression that she had listened to every piece of the argument. I feel bad because I may have overreacted to something as simple as school pictures. Plus, I ruined my daughter's evening and my wife's too. And I also made my wife cry.

So Reddit, AITA?

TL;DR: I shouted at my wife after she made some comments about my daughter's school photos and I'im wondering if I'm the AH.

Edit: This is not the first time my wife has said something like this. This is why I feel even more terrible because I let my daughter suffer like this. I did give my wife a word or two, but I always told Hayoung that this was just the way she spoke and that she really did love her. I really want to cry right now, especially overhearing Hayoung crying herself to sleep yesterday night. She always kept on a brave face around me and my wife, but it just breaks me even more, now knowing she feels like she can't talk to me either. I've failed her.Hayoung always asked me every morning if she looked beautiful. She would always ask at mealtimes if she was eating too much. I'm so afraid of the damage we both put her through for so long. I'm so scared she's going to develop am eating disorder and I'm going to make sure to set things straight with my wife and take care of my daughter better. She is always my first priority.

Edit 2: I was taken off guard even though my wife has made responses like this in the past, because though it's not the first time, I had a little bit of hope left that she wouldn't point out Hayoung's appearance that outright in her school photo.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"AITA for blowing up at my wife over my daughter's school picture?

I will admit, I raised my voice while we were having that argument and I'm seriously sitting here questioning myself about whether I was the asshole or not. After our argument, I knocked on Hayoung's door and I could tell by her expression that she had listened to every piece of the argument. I feel bad because I may have overreacted to something as simple as school pictures. Plus, I ruined my daughter's evening and my wife's too. And I also made my wife cry.

So Reddit, AITA?

TL;DR: I shouted at my wife after she made some comments about my daughter's school photos and I'im wondering if I'm the AH.

Edit: This is not the first time my wife has said something like this. This is why I feel even more terrible because I let my daughter suffer like this. I did give my wife a word or two, but I always told Hayoung that this was just the way she spoke and that she really did love her. I really want to cry right now, especially overhearing Hayoung crying herself to sleep yesterday night. She always kept on a brave face around me and my wife, but it just breaks me even more, now knowing she feels like she can't talk to me either. I've failed her.Hayoung always asked me every morning if she looked beautiful. She would always ask at mealtimes if she was eating too much. I'm so afraid of the damage we both put her through for so long. I'm so scared she's going to develop am eating disorder and I'm going to make sure to set things straight with my wife and take care of my daughter better. She is always my first priority.

Edit 2: I was taken off guard even though my wife has made responses like this in the past, because though it's not the first time, I had a little bit of hope left that she wouldn't point out Hayoung's appearance that outright in her school photo.",0.0,1.054413914680481,1,0

So I have this friend (24f and I’m (24)f we met through mutual friends and became closer, and have been friends for almost two years.

What rubs me the wrong way is that she never compliments me or tells me that my style is good or I look good, and if you’re a girl or live with girls you’ll know how often women compliment each other especially friends. A few specific incidents are, I have naturally curly/wavy hair, I straighten it a lot but I decided I’ll go curly again, and transitioning from straight to curly is a big decision if you’ve fried your natural curls, I asked her if I should and she told me no point blank that straight is better and it came up in convos multiple times and she would hold the same sentiment. I didn’t like her answer and continued to keep my hair natural and not a month or two later she started wearing curly hair, with the same style and pattern as mine. I jokingly called her out on it and she’s like I like it on myself but not you. And I would have considered it if everybody else said the same but people love my curls. It seems to me that she wants to copy me but then wants me to stop doing that thing so she can be the only one doing it. 

Another is that she started copying my makeup style, even though before that she had a completely different style of makeup for years and years. And she never acknowledges or credits me for it. Another is she started posing like me in pictures and using filters I use after saying one of the filters I use is like plastic surgery and that it looks too fake (p.s it’s does enhance but it looks pretty natural on me) and then now she exclusively only uses that or similar filters. She also acts like she’s the one who came up with things I do and gives me unsolicited advice as if she knows better and tells me to do the things I do anyway and it always feels belittling. And she also compliments other people she admires, she will literally fan girl over them and I don’t want that but some semblance of acknowledgment would help. She also now acts as if I’m ugly, when someone who knows us compliments us she’ll say “this is such a huge thing he thinks YOURE so pretty” especially if it’s men.

I showed her old/new pictures to my other friends/boyfriend, all agree that she’s blatantly copying me. And also keep in mind that I don’t think people doing the same thing as me from time to time is copying people take inspiration, and if I ever talked to them they would always compliment me on said thing.

Now the cherry on top is, she copied my hairstyle and makeup without acknowledgment and then when another girl (who’s a mutual but not close friend) copied that same hairstyle she copied from me she started talking literal shit about her to us. And that bothers me so much that you’ve been copying me but when someone else does it it’s wrong. So am I an asshole for low-key resenting her for this?

87,1da6yu8,AITA for asking my mum to not move house?,"I live with my mum in social housing (cheap rent). I work full time, pay for most things, paid off around £6k of her debts. She is a writer, has several publication deals lined up, but this doesn't bring in any money and I continue to pay for most things. The plan is I support her while she looks for a day job to support her writing. Also we agreed I can live with her while I save for a deposit.

A benefactor recently paid for a room for her to write in an office in the centre of London (we live just outside London). She's struggling with paying for travel into her office so has asked if we wanted to move to London so it's cheaper (this will be via social housing exchange, much cheaper than private renting). She asks this once a week, I keep saying no as it's too expensive, and I earn too much for me to go into social housing so will have to rent privately. I said I can pay for her travel costs for the moment until she finds a job. She keeps asking still.

We spoke about it this morning because it is really stressing me out (I secretly think she is just going to move houses and leave me to find somewhere to live). I explained my reasons again and a few others. First was she is approaching her life wrong: most writers have day jobs as their writing makes little money, so moving to London is just a way of her avoiding getting a job. Also, if our roles were reversed and I decided to devote my life to something that makes no money and depend on her financially, I would expect her to have a problem with this. Second, if the writing doesn't work out, she will have uprooted our lives for nothing (I don't mind living in London, just it's a major change to accomodate a small problem). She hated the last point, told me ""You're not a baby anymore, I can't keep worrying about how things will affect you."" I responded: ""Do what you want then."" We haven't spoken since.

If the worst happens and I have to rent privately, I will just about afford it but my plan of home ownership will be delayed A LOT if not impossible. It would also be emotionally quite difficult and hard to maintain a relationship with my mum if this happened.

He did attend big events in her life, like graduation and wedding and my birth, but I saw him for like a week every couple of years. My mother knew very little about her paternal family except that grandfather had 2 half siblings she had met a few times in her life. I have never met any of them.

My grandfather left behind some properties and money. When I looked into it, he has been letting some children of his nieces and nephews stay for roughly $100 a month in his places. He had also set up his bank account to deposit a relatively small amount of money every month to a few older family members.

I asked my lawyer to take care of evicting these people and stop the monthly allowance.

The extended family now reach out to me, claiming that grandfather has promised he would help them out until they are back on their feet and that as I received his inheritance, it is only right I carry on his intention. They asked me for another year and then they will not seek my support anymore.

I don't want to offend anyone but it's really sucking my energy these past few weeks. Should I tell them it's too much for me or should I suck it up? ",4.0,0.06546521186828613,0,0
91,1da695t,AITA for telling my wife's BIL he can't speak for every guy with a unisex name or gender bending names?,"My SIL (wife's sister) is expecting her first child with her husband. For the last four and a half months of her pregnancy he has been insufferable. SIL and him are no closer to finding a name for their baby and he uses the pregnancy and the fact they are actively still naming their baby to shit on unisex and gender bending names (boy names on girls and girl names on boys). His name is Skyler and he talks about how cruel his parents were for giving him such a girly name and a name that is meant for girls more than boys. He has ranted about people trying to call him Skye and how that's such a girls name.

He rants and raves and regularly brings up the fact men should not have unisex or girls names and yet so many people think naming a boy Riley today is fine, or naming a boy Sage makes sense. He said it's wrong. He talked about meeting a young boy named Wren and how his parents had cursed him to forever be mistaken for a girl when they hear the name. He said no man or boy likes those names. No man or boy wants to be called those names. 

As a male Indigo who goes by Indie in day to day life, including at work (and school and college when I went) I disagree that *every* guy feels this way. I don't. I also know a guy named Kenzie (from school) who never had a problem with his name. I know a guy named Sonny who hated his name because he felt it was too girly. So it balances out. But my wife's BIL is adamant that every man and boy with any name that gets used on girls too is disgusted by it and hates it. He will not let it go.

This came up again on Saturday when we went out to lunch. He was being loud and doing his same old rant as always. This time I spoke up and told him he can't speak for all guys with unisex or gender bending names because we don't all hate our names and he can look to me as an example if he wants. I also pointed to a guy he follows on social media who technically has a unisex name. I told him they might not be his thing, and that's fine, nobody can force him to like those names. But he's wrong to speak in absolutes about it like he does.

He acted like I had personally demanded he name his son Ella or something. He called me a dick and told me I can't force my opinion down his throat like that. His wife told him to shut up and listen to what I actually said. But he told me I had humiliated him and told him he's wrong to have his opinions and that makes me TA.

They only have one tiny ""flaw"": they have the tendecy to make up stories, or just exaggerate / change / add to any roumor they hear. So they are not the most reliable source of information.

Until now though it was never truly an issue.

**Onto the actual situation:** i was talking to them, and out of the blue (we were talking about a completely different subject) they told me that one of our friends (I'll call them friend 2) boss has been hitting on another mutual (let's call them friend 3) for a while, and that boss was so insisting in DMing them that friend 3 had to go talk with friend 2 in order to manage the situation.

I was shocked, to say the least, from this, since boss has never acted even slightly out of line whenever I personally saw them, but friend was very sure of what they said. Their parter then questioned them, since they too were shocked and hardly believed that, but friend got offended and still they doubled down saying that this was the truth.

Friend can easily get offended when someone doesn't believe in something they are very sure is right.

Fast forward a couple of days, I was talking with friend 2, who was complaining about the amount of work they had, and this story came to mind. So I asked them, and friend 2 denied this happened, they had no recollection whatsoever.

After a while they found though a screenshot friend 3 had sent 3 years ago in which you could see boss sending a heart emoji to them. Friend 3 sent friend 2 the screen, asking if it was normal, then sent another screen of boss apologizing and saying they just sent the emoji on error, and that it was meant for another person.

That's it.

That's the ""hitting on so badly"".

Friend 2 showed me the convos, and boss name was never metioned again in their chat (they did this to prove me boss is a nice person).

Friend 2 got understandably upset, since this is quite a serious accusation. They didn't do anything, and don't plan to, to avoid any drama.

But now I am upset, since if friend keep spreading this roumor it could havily damage boss professional and personal life.

His parents showed no interest at the time but did change their minds in the last couple of years. My stepbrother's mom passed away when he was a baby and (step)dad met my mom and married her. Dad adopted me and my mom adopted my stepbrother and we were raised unaware that we had been adopted by a stepparent and that we weren't bio siblings. The truth came out a year and a half ago when I found out my paternal side were interested in getting to know me and I questioned it which led to us learning the truth.

I was cool with it since nobody from the bio side took an interest in me my whole life up to that point. But my stepbrother felt way different. It really devastated him to learn his mom was erased and her family were denied the chance to be in his life. We went to therapy and after a few sessions my stepbrother said he wanted us to be stepsiblings and my mom to be his stepmom. I use step for him. My parents hate it though. My stepbrother asked them how they would like to be erased like his mom was.

My parents never answered. They told him he needs to understand better that they just wanted a happy normal family. My brother told them to fuck their happy normal family and fuck dad for causing so much pain. He told my mom she would never be his real mom, she had happily gone along with erasing the woman who gave birth to him and planned to raise him with my dad.

97,1da5usy,AITA for refusing to teach my sister a language I don't know?,"Ok, so I recently got moved to a new foster family and they're pretty cool mostly. They have 3 kids already, 2 bio, one also a foster. I get along with 2/3 one 17F and one 14M. The one I don't get along with is Penny, 15F. She keeps speaking spanish to me. 

I do not speak Spanish. 

I don't know why she thinks I do. I speak Portuguese, Urdu, English and some German, but not Spanish. For some reason, when she found out I'd be getting moved in, she was very excited to have someone to practice Spanish with. The issue is, she refuses to speak to me in ANY other language! I do not speak Spanish. There's overlap so I can get the gist sometimes but she's learning like classical Spanish with very bad pronunciation, while I know a version from my mum, spending the first 5ish years of my life in Maranhao.

Half the time I don't know what she's saying, its just sounds like a garbled version of Portuguese, like I **should** know what she's saying but not quite. The other day she asked me to please help her learn. I told her I can't help her learn because I don't know Spanish.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"AITA for refusing to teach my sister a language I don't know? Ok, so I recently got moved to a new foster family and they're pretty cool mostly. They have 3 kids already, 2 bio, one also a foster. I get along with 2/3 one 17F and one 14M. The one I don't get along with is Penny, 15F. She keeps speaking spanish to me. 

I do not speak Spanish. 

I don't know why she thinks I do. I speak Portuguese, Urdu, English and some German, but not Spanish. For some reason, when she found out I'd be getting moved in, she was very excited to have someone to practice Spanish with. The issue is, she refuses to speak to me in ANY other language! I do not speak Spanish. There's overlap so I can get the gist sometimes but she's learning like classical Spanish with very bad pronunciation, while I know a version from my mum, spending the first 5ish years of my life in Maranhao.

Half the time I don't know what she's saying, its just sounds like a garbled version of Portuguese, like I **should** know what she's saying but not quite. The other day she asked me to please help her learn. I told her I can't help her learn because I don't know Spanish. She told me that she knows Spanish is extremely similar to Portuguese so I should be able to teach her some.

98,1da5p14,AITAH for reacting negatively when I found out my husband gave his female trainer his tshirt?,"My (37f) husband (37m) is overseas and currently attending a safety training course. He messages me last night over WhatsApp saying his trainer (50+f) during the class said she really really likes the tshirt he is wearing and that she wants him to give it to her. He said he wasn’t sure if she was being serious or was just joking but he ended up changing out of his tshirt ( he had an extra jacket) and ended up giving the tshirt to her to which she was apparently really happy about and gave him a book in return. 

For context the tshirt has the logo of the company he works for (Which she is not affiliated with) and also the logo of the end user client whom she has worked with before.

I got really surprised when he told me that he did actually pass the tshirt on and I asked him if he thought it was appropriate if a male trainer had asked me for my tshirt to which he didn’t reply and I told him this situation has made me feel uncomfortable. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting because he checked with his other friends and apparently none of them thought there was anything weird about it.

So Reddit can you please tell me if IATH for thinking this exchange is inappropriate and that my husband shouldn’t have given his tshirt. 

Edit:

Thank you everyone for your replies and input. Reading all your comments I just want to clarify that I do not suspect that my husband was trying to be flirty with the trainer or anything sexual in nature for that matter. I really am very glad that he was honest and told me about it. 

I should mention that the safety trainer does not speak English and a translator was involved so I’m guessing some level of miscommunication took place.

I was just weirded out about why he felt the need to give the trainer a tshirt that he was wearing the whole day. It wouldn’t have weirded me out if he had gone back and washed it or something and then gave it to her. I’d definitely find it gross if someone I barely knew gave me their used tshirt.  I’m also pretty sure the trainer didn’t mean she wanted the tshirt straightaway.

99,1da5mp4,AITA for starting the dryer late at night?,"I (26F) live with my two sisters *Maureen* (23F) and *Lisa* (18F) at my parents' place. Basically, my dad was sent abroad for work in 2021, my mom followed him, but my sisters stayed back to study, and I moved in my parents' bedroom (both to save money on rent and look over my sisters).

My two sisters have never really lived on their own, and they are used to having someone come over once or twice a week to clean up the appartment. They are pretty independant, both have student jobs, can cook, go grocery shopping, do the dishes, but they lack the reflexes you learn when being 100% responsible for the state of your home, since they are used to someone cleaning up behind them regularly.

One of the things they are terrible at is managing the laundry. Unless they have nothing to wear, they'll just let the laundry pile up in the basket until the cleaning lady or I take care of it. It sometimes feels like this comedy video on guys saying they have a ""magical basket"" where they put their dirty clothes and everything comes back clean and folded. They also never notice when the washing machine is full and the clothes need to be hung or put in the dryer, which has led to clothing being left to mold for multiple days, on the weeks where I'm away. This means I'm almost always the one starting the dryer, and as I come home later and electricity is cheaper at night, I usually do so around 10/11PM.

However, my youngest sister (Lisa) has been complaining that the beeping of the dryer wakes her up in the middle of the night. To be fair, it *is* pretty lound and insistant, and her room is directly next to the kitchen, where our dryer and washing machines are. I try to stay up until the end of the cycle to turn it off as soon as it starts beeping, but sometimes I'm just too tired to do so. I told Lisa that if she doesn't want me to start the dryer at night, she should learn to check the washing machine when she comes home (usually, she's home long before me) so that she launches it earlier. Even though she agreed, it seems like she always forgets.

Yesterday, I launched the dryer at 11PM, and Lisa complained about it when I went to wish her a good night. I again told her that there is a simple solution, and she told me that I could just start the dryer in the morning instead. I told her I'm in a rush in the morning, and as they are both unreliable when it comes to the laundry, I'll stick with the schedule that is most convenient for me.

101,1da559m,AITA For Dancing With Somebody Else At My Senior Prom,"I (18 female) casually invited my friend Cookie, (18 meal), to our senior prom. It wasn't anything special, more like friends agreeing to attend a party together. Cookie accepted, and we made plans to go together. However, my motives weren't entirely innocent. See I never made out with a boy before, and it's not like I can't get a boy to kiss me. It's just I'm kind of scared and don't know what to do, and Cookie seemed like a safe option since he liked me and wasn't unattractive. 

On prom day, we met at the event instead of arriving together. When I saw him the first thought in my head was ""Why didn't he cut his hair"", but he was well dress. Determined to stick to my plan, I subtly signaled my intentions by linking arms with him and guiding him around the prom. We took pictures, danced, but it felt like I was dragging him along.  Finally, it was the slow dance, and my big moment arrived. The key moment that I was gonna use to get me to the make out zone. I locked my eyes with his, pointed to the dance floor, asked if he wanted to dance. He said yeah, I was like bet. We on the dance floor, I looked into his eyes and...annd.. HE DOSEN'T KNOW HOW TO SLOW DANCE!!!

Personally, I was shocked, I thought everybody knew how to slow dance, APPARENTLY NOT. Disappointed but undeterred, I tried to guide him, dropping hints about what I wanted.  I told him to stop dancing and give me his hand. I then placed his other hand on my hip and locked my eyes with his. I wanted him to pull me closer, but I had a feeling that wasn't gonna happen. So, I put it upon myself to get closer to him (Smooth right). I started to slowly sway to the beat of the music, trying to show him what I wanted. Yeah, long story short, the slow dance was a disaster.

Afterward, we went our separate ways. I really didn't want to be around him at that point, and I was upset that my goal of having my first make out session wasn't going to happen. Even though my plans were ruined, my night wasn't. I had a good time at prom. This is when my other friend, Potato (18 male) comes in. I told him what happened with me and Cookie, and we had a good laugh about it. Now let me say this I wasn't gonna make out with Potato. I didn't like him like that, but that didn't stop me from dancing with him. I had asked him to teach me this dance that everybody was doing (It was a Hispanic dance I didn't know how to do). He said yes and I had a good time dancing with him.

Time skip, I'm now back at school, and I'm hearing that Cookie is mad at me for dancing with Potato. I kind of understand why he was mad, but we went to prom as friends.

I rushed downstairs, pulling on some shorts inside out, no glasses on, and listened to my neighbour angrily rant at me for 3 minutes. My neighbour was demanding that the baby couldn't stay for another night and had to go home today (Friday), that she is working in the morning and has been kept awake for hours, she is a woman and therefore very sensitive to the noise of a baby crying, that she never makes noise in the flat and therefore she is a good neighbour and I'm not, that I should have informed her that a baby would be here in advance and that she had reported me to our shared landlady. I stood there dazed and apologising intermittently until about 3 mins in when her partner came to the door and assumedly ushered her inside.

It's a place I've been saving and working super hard for (something that all of my friends are aware of) and everyone was happy to come over and celebrate the milestone. 

The issue is that one of my friends (""Suzy"") is a popular vlogger. She asked if she could film part of the party to include in her ""day in the life"" video. I'm super private, so I said no at first, but Suzy promised she wouldn't show anything personal and only wanted a couple scenes of my friends laughing together and footage of the food spread. She also promised I wouldn't be in the video.

I was still uncomfortable, but after she assured she wouldn't overshare, I said fine. 

The day of, within 10 minutes of the party starting, a mutual friend pulled me aside and said that she saw Suzy filming her intro and mentioned giving a ""house tour"" of her friend's new home. She also said that she saw Suzy filming the outside of my home from top to bottom, and it would be easy to tell the neighborhood I lived in. 

During the entirety of the party, I noticed that Suzy kept filming more than what she promised, so I did confront her about it. I asked to see the footage, and Suzy said ""no"", and acted super offended that I wouldn't trust her. 

I waited towards the end of the party, and when Suzy was in the bathroom before leaving, I decided to just go through her camera. I was furious when I noticed that she filmed my whole home (even my bedroom and closet), and there were tons of clips where you could clearly see my face. I'm not kidding when I say that the footage looked like one of those home tour videos that realtors post online. 

I can admit that I was acting on impulse and my anger at this point, but I went ahead and just deleted all of the footage of the party. She found out shortly after when she went to shoot footage of everyone leaving, and confronted me. I did admit to doing it, and we had a bit of a row until I just kicked her out. Most of my friends are understanding and ""on my side"", but they did say that I shouldn't have gone and deleted the footage myself. I personally felt like I did the nice way of asking Suzy directly first, but she was being so obstinate that I had no choice. 

The drama's been spreading around now with mixed reactions, so I wanted another opinion in case I really was the AH.

So I (22)F up until recently was an Android user. My boyfriend (25)M is basically an Apple fanatic. So he wanted to make our apartment a SMART apartment so I agreed to get an IPhone.

I am currently in University so after some pestering from him I agreed and saved up for an IPad (he did help me pay half since once again I am a uni student and up until then I had used his IPad and his Drawing Tablet to make notes and it was not working).

So a few months ago, my bf, lets call him Josh, got an Apple Watch which he loves. And he would not stop talking about how much I need one and how it'll be great to work out together. Now keep in mind I still have not adjusted to my new IPhone despite owning it for months now. (Again me and my entire family up until we met him were loyal to Samsung).

So my birthday came in May and he got me an Apple Watch, and I have been figuring out how to use it and I just simply do not get it. I have watched videos and generally I just work better when someone shows it to me. So 30 minutes ago I asked him to teach me how to use the Apple Watch, and he said it is not his job to teach me these things because I am a grown woman.

109,1da3pby,AITA for not telling my girlfriend I catfished as people from our highschool?,"For some background, I (18F) and my girlfriend (also 18F, who we’ll refer to as “G”) have been together since we were 16.

Freshman year was rough for me. I dealt with a lot of bullying in middle school and had little to no friends until I reached my sophomore year of hs. This, combined with the Covid-19 outbreak, had me pretty lonely. I ended up making an account on Discord (out of all places) and finding a couple of online friends who shared similar interests as me. 

Then, one account turned to two, and two turned to three, and so on. By a few months, I had six different alt accounts that I all claimed were my “school friends” and introduced them to my friends on Discord. I even used pictures from people I knew of and set that as their display photo. I’d speak as if I were them, fabricate up lies about what plans we had and what inside jokes we’d made. It was a deep lie I was into, but it never got dangerous or caused any harm. I never used anyone's real name, including mine.

Flash forward to when I met G. I had a solid group of friends, the Discord accounts were deactivated (our group went separate ways amicably) and to be honest, I’d forgotten all about it. It genuinely didn’t cross my mind again until G confronted me about it the other day.

I had G over at my house, and while I was taking a nap, she stole my phone and looked through my camera roll, finding all those old screenshots from 2020. I’ve never been against her looking through my phone, hence why she has the passcode.

Apparently, she was acquaintances with one of the people at our highschool who I’d catfished as. She was beyond angry at me, and even accused me of only dating her to get closer to the acquaintance. I denied this and repeatedly tried to explain my side (with full understanding of how weird the situation seemed.) She screamed about how I should’ve told her I did this and threw my phone on the floor before leaving my house in the middle of the night.

I guess she told her friends (and the acquaintance) about the incident because I’ve been sent many angry messages from them. She’s also been telling them that I have a personality disorder, which is not true. I’m not worried about them anymore, we recently graduated so it’s not like I’ll be seeing any of these people soon. But I’m worried about my girlfriend. I’ve tried to text/call her but she says she isn’t ready to talk to me yet. Should I have told her? Am I the asshole?

114,1da12p1,AITA for telling my sister she shouldn't have changed the song at my favourite part?,"For context, I'm (F24) usually the person who sits in the passenger while my sister (F29) is the one who always drives. During a chipotle run back home today, I was playing a song that drops in the last 20 seconds and those 20 seconds are my favourite part of the song. We listened to the entire song and when the beat drop came - 10 seconds in, my sister (who was driving) went like ""what's with this song?"" and changed it through the control on the steering wheel. I immediately went like ""that was my favourite part of the song. It was going to get over in 10 seconds anyway"" and she went like ""oh"" and went back to it.

After that, she shut herself down for the rest of the ride and did not say a word. When I asked why she was upset, she said that her skipping the song wasn't a big deal and she didn't like my overreaction. I was confused as I didn't understand how me telling her that she shouldn't have skipped the song is an overreaction. I genuinely didn't think it was a big deal that I simply told her she shouldn't have skipped a song I liked. She said it sounded rude and that she didn't know I liked it enough to not skip. I proceeded to say well why did she just not ask? And she said there's many instances where I've skipped songs she wanted to listen to but I genuinely don't think this has ever happened.

I don't think this whole thing was a big deal until I noticed she shut herself down for me simply telling her that she shouldn't have skipped it. I thought she was trying to make this about herself, victimize herself and just can't take criticism of any kind - even just someone telling her not to do something. I thought it was super childish to make this into a whole thing. She thinks I'm TA for being rude for telling her (allegedly in a bad tone) that she shouldn't have skipped it. 

I thought it was such a silly thing to give me the silent treatment over and she just needed a reason to victimize herself and make this about her - when she could've just said ""I'm sorry I didn't mean to"" and I would've forgotten about it. Instead she turned this into a whole fight and if there was a ""victim"" here, it would've been me for her trying to make me feel guilty about nothing and giving me the silent treatment over it.",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-07,"AITA for telling my sister she shouldn't have changed the song at my favourite part? For context, I'm (F24) usually the person who sits in the passenger while my sister (F29) is the one who always drives. During a chipotle run back home today, I was playing a song that drops in the last 20 seconds and those 20 seconds are my favourite part of the song. We listened to the entire song and when the beat drop came - 10 seconds in, my sister (who was driving) went like ""what's with this song?"" and changed it through the control on the steering wheel. I immediately went like ""that was my favourite part of the song. It was going to get over in 10 seconds anyway"" and she went like ""oh"" and went back to it.

After that, she shut herself down for the rest of the ride and did not say a word. When I asked why she was upset, she said that her skipping the song wasn't a big deal and she didn't like my overreaction. I was confused as I didn't understand how me telling her that she shouldn't have skipped the song is an overreaction. I genuinely didn't think it was a big deal that I simply told her she shouldn't have skipped a song I liked. She said it sounded rude and that she didn't know I liked it enough to not skip. I proceeded to say well why did she just not ask? And she said there's many instances where I've skipped songs she wanted to listen to but I genuinely don't think this has ever happened.

I don't think this whole thing was a big deal until I noticed she shut herself down for me simply telling her that she shouldn't have skipped it. I thought she was trying to make this about herself, victimize herself and just can't take criticism of any kind - even just someone telling her not to do something.

115,1da0v3s,AITA for arguing with my boyfriend when he commented on my shorts?,"I (25F) almost never wear provocative clothing. My usual clothes are sweatpants, PJ pants or leggings with a t-shirt or hoodie. 

Today, I happened to be wearing baggy pajama shorts that definitely cannot be defined as booty shorts. I was wearing them because it haven’t done my laundry in weeks & had nothing else that wouldn’t make me sweat, as it was in the 80’s today and my postpartum hormones make me sweat like crazy. It was also in my plans today to deep clean the house, so I knew I’d be working up a sweat anyway. 

The only places I went was to my grandmothers house to drop off my 4-month old daughter, to the drive thru in the bank and to the drive thru at Dunkin. So it’s not like I even went into a public place with these shorts on. 

I got home and my boyfriend (26M) asked me to sit down so he can talk to me and asked me “if this was something new” (meaning me wearing booty shorts outside). This is the second time he’s commented on something I was wearing when my outfit really wasn’t that bad, so it really bothered me. 

I told him I didn’t go inside anywhere, I just stayed in my car except to bring my daughter into my grandmas house. I also told him these weren’t booty shorts at ALL, they’re baggy and don’t show my booty. He still kept asking if it’s a new thing that I’m wearing booty shorts outside and I continued to say no but defending myself saying that it’s not provocative and I’m not showing anything off (trust me, I’m not). 

I was mad because I never do wear shorts outside in public, but it’s all I really had to wear and it was hot so I didn’t want to sweat. Plus I stayed in my car the whole time, so no one really saw me. So, the ONE time I decide to wear shorts, he acts like I’m turning over a new leaf and turning into a hoe.

 He told me that I’M making a big deal out of this, but I think that HE is. He says that I could have simply said “no, it’s not something new” instead of “turning it into an argument”. 

He even left for work 2 hours early and let me clean the house all by myself (now in a bad mood) and is continuing to be distant and cold with me. He’s always distant and cold for like 3 days after an argument.

AITA for arguing with him about this?

116,1da0k71,AITA for laughing at my boyfriends ex girlfriend when she begged me for help ," I (25f) was in a relationship with ""Jake""(24m) form 2017-2020. It was a friendly break up because we both knew it wasn't working out,I've spoken to Jake twice since the break up literally the awkward ""hi,how are you"" that's it I don't even live in the same town as Jake anymore 


Fast forward to January I started getting hate on tiktok/Instagram and my business got bad reviews now I know I don't do anything on social media to get hate so I was confused.one person was decent enough to ask me my side I was like ""what side"" than she showed me the tiktoks Jake and his new girlfriend ""becca""(20f) where making about me. They were making it look like I was a crazy ex who wasn't over him and I was bullying becca. Guys I didn't even know becca existed and when I tried to message Jake I found he blocked me. This went on for two months they'd make a random tiktok or talk bad about me on live.

Becca is a micro influencer in my country so I would get hate to the point I even had to go private on social media which hurt me financially. So in March becca made a post comparing us on looks and she didn't get the reaction she wanted. She try to say I sent people to body shame  her to get me hate and boy did I get hate, so I said fuck it and made a post with proof clearing my name, it didn't go viral but enough people had seen it to ""ruin"" Jake and becca's tiktok careers. I've had peace since and more customers since  

Well becca reached out to me Wednesday(idk how she got my number) saying she relied on tiktok especially gifts from lives as income.she basically wanted me to make a tiktok saying I spoke to her,she apologised,I forgive her and tell people to think of other's mental health when spreading hate online.i literally busted out laughing like she didn't apologise nor was the reason behind the tiktoks excusable. becca ended crying telling me i ruined her life than hung up. I've gotten messages from I'm assuming beccas friends calling me an asshole (and more) for laughing at someone having a mental health crisis clearly begging me for help
