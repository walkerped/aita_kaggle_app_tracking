0,1d9znmz,AITA for asking my mom to reimburse me for groceries? ,"
I [F22] am watching my brother [M16] for five weeks while my mother goes abroad on vacation with her bf. Initially she was going to have him stay by himself the whole time, but I told her she couldn't do that because 1) he's still a kid and b) he has autism. Granted he has low support needs but you still need to remind him to clean up after himself and make sure he eats stuff other than top ramen. 

She countered having someone come for two weeks, but I told her that was still too long. I’ve always been guiding her on how to be a parent and taking over for her, even so far as going to a parent teacher conference for my brother when I was fourteen. I offered to have him come stay with me but she declined since he had summer school and work. 

She asked me if I could come and I told her I couldn’t just leave my job for an entire month as I’m a nanny and don’t have PTO. I compromised and told her if she paid my half of rent ($1000) I would ask to take an unpaid leave which I was lucky to my boss saying yes.

Fast forward and right before she leaves we were supposed to get groceries but we didn’t have time, so she told me she would pay me back. I said okay and things were fine. Today, I went grocery shopping and spent $145. I tried to be frugal and get stuff on clearance/sale to make it a little easier for her. 

I called her and asked her to reimburse me but she got annoyed and changed the subject. She asked how much was my brother working, which I didn’t see the point as he’s the child; he’s entitled to free food. She ended the call saying she would pay 
 me, but an hour went by so I sent her a request for money to which she’s still ignoring. Im debating if it’s worth the effort bc she’s usually really hard to get to pay back money, she’ll even get upset and start whining which makes me feel guilty but still. 

A part of me does wonder tho if I’m being an AH bc I am an adult and would have to pay for groceries anyways so I should just take the responsibility, but on the flip side I’m moving when I go back home and wasn’t trying to deplete my savings especially since I gave up a month of income ($2000).

3,1d9yyu0,AITA for telling my cousin's fiance she shouldn't get married?,"I (24f) have a very big family. I've been living in the .U.S for about a year now to be closer to my mum's side of the family. Most of my mum's side are all very religious. A week ago I was at my cousin Mike's (18m) birthday party. It was going good until the end when Mike was unwrapping gifts. At the end he pulled out a ring and proposed to his gf Jane (18f) of one year. Everyone was over the moon but the whole time I was just thinking about how Mike and Jane just graduated from high school. I told Mike's brother John (28m) about my concerns and he said it's always better to get married young. I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode because everyone is saying how excited they are and not one person in my family of 70+ people has expressed the same concerns as me.

In the country that I'm from (Ireland) I knew a lot of couples who got married young and they all ended up divorcing. Jane also has some undiagnosed mental condition. I'm not sure what but she definitely has something up with her. For example, at a birthday party a couple weeks ago Jane grabbed a stump and then started running around yelling ""I STOLE A STUMP I STOLE A STUMP"". She is very clingy somedays and the next is completely normal. I feel bad saying that because she is a very sweet girl but I'm worried for her because I know my family will probably have high expectations for her that I know she won't live up to. I came up to her at a party yesterday and had a heart to heart.

I told her that my family is probably going to expect her to have kids and if that's something she wants while she's so young. I explained to her about how this decision will affect her and she thanked me. She said she's going to rethink wether or not she wants to get married. I was honestly really proud of her for actually telling me how she felt. I got a call this morning from my aunt Clara (50f) who is Jake's mom, about how I need to stop sticking my nose in places it doesn't belong and how I just destroyed a relationship. i was confused because Jane and Mike didn't break up? She and my other relatives have been messaging me telling me that I'm irresponsible for planting ideas into Jane's head and how I need to mind my own business. I'm wondering if I crossed the line by talking with Jane so AITA?

UPDATE : Thanks for the response everyone I appreciate the insight. My Aunt Clara called me again an hour ago to talk to me. She was just yelling at me the whole time so I told her to leave me alone. She then said I was probably tearing down a happy relationship because my ex fiancee left me for another girl so I was jealous of Jane getting what I couldn't. That was the point where I went off on her and told her that Jane is not an incubator for future grandchildren, she's a real person that doesn't want to get married right now. She ended the call and said that she and a couple other family members will not speak to me until I apologise. Which will never happen. Mike texted me and said that his mom was the one who encouraged him to get engaged and like I suspected bought the ring. He then said that he didn't really want to get married either and thanked me.

I was hoping to get some advice/perspective on this. I am 29 years old and recently graduated professional school. I am working and making about 140k a year (pre-tax). I thankfully have no student debt but my husband has about 100k in student loan debt. My parents are divorced and my mother immigrated to the US when she married my dad 30+ years ago. The highest level of education she has is a high school degree, and she has never had an official job in the US after marrying my dad. Growing up she was a stay at home mom and after my parents divorced, she was receiving alimony for about 10 years before it stopped. She was running her own catering business for a while but that has stopped and she is currently unemployed and is struggling to pay her bills. She has not applied for any jobs and she frequently travels out of the country to visit family. My younger sibling was living with her and financially supporting her, but recently lost her job. My youngest sibling just graduated from college and received money from my grandparents, all of which she gave to my mother. I feel like my mother expects all of her kids, especially me, to help pay her bills as I have what she sees as a high income and zero debt. I recently got married and my husband makes about 60k (pre-tax) a year. We would like to buy a house and have a baby within the next few years so we are trying to save a much as we can. My mother has not explicitly asked me for money but she has made comments to my siblings, such as that I have not offered to help her out and she is unable to get a job without a college degree.

5,1d9yf6o,AITA For making my brother drink from a dirty cup,"I (17f) and my brother (14m) recently got into an altercation. Me and my brother split the chores of the house. I clean the kitchen while my brother does the dishes. Recently he has been getting lazy with the dishes and just throwing them into the dishwasher. This has resulted in cups and a lot of other dishes still being covered in food after being put away. I have brought this up to him and my parents after trying to eat cereal and realizing there’s food on the spoon. Or just seeing stuff in a dirty cup. 

My breaking point was when I grabbed a fork for one of my friends and seeing salmon from the night before stuck on it. The next morning I told my parents and brother how embarrassing it was. They told my brother, and he just replied with a nod. 

2 days ago, I went to pour some orange juice in one of our cups. I realized there was some stuff on the bottom. Tbh idk what it was. But honestly it looked like someone tried to make a protien shake but the powder got stuck on the bottom. I was so disgusted by it, I just skipped breakfast and just put the cup away.

Later my brother drank from that same cup. He screamed in horror. Luckily for me I was in the living room when it happened. I laughed at him,  and told him karma is a mf. He looked at me and asked if I knew. I smiled and said maybe. I tried to explain to him that it wasn’t intentional. But he ran upstairs before I could explain. 

During dinner (my brother didn’t eat with us) my mother instantly told me what I did was immature and mean. I explained that it might have been, but it was definitely effective. My father agreed with my mother, but also agreed my brother needs to clean the dishes better. My brother came to my room that night and told me that he was furious and extremely disgusted. That has really thrown me off. He has never been that like that, that confrontational which is making me feel very bad. He hasn’t talked to me since and I really don’t know if I was the AH. The thing is, this was all avoidable, but it will be effective. AITA?

I started attending AA and through that group I made some of my closest friends. It also helps that we are all sober and plan on staying that way so we can do fun activities without worrying about alcohol being around.

Whenever I’m with family or friends who do consume alcohol I don’t make them stop drinking as they can do what they want. My only rule is no alcohol in my place.

I’m throwing a birthday barbecue and invited my friends and family. As a good chunk of my friends are all recovering alcoholics and I don’t like alcohol around my place I have said it’s an alcohol free barbecue and I’ll be providing alcohol free drinks, I’ve even brought an alcohol free cocktail book to attempt some extra cute drinks for people.

My family have all said it will be boring without alcohol and that I’m fine when we go out and they drink. I tried to explain that a glass of wine with a steak is different to multiple beers at a barbecue, but they ignored that.

I ended up sending them a message that basically said “if you bring alcohol you won’t be allowed to attend my birthday” 

They haven’t taken it well and think I’m being an asshole.

8,1d9y6rm,AITAH for requiring my friend to make plans for a trip a certain amount ahead of time?,"I’ve had to move a lot for work, so many of my friends are scattered across the country. This requires either me to visit them, then to visit me, or for us both to travel somewhere and meet up. Based on my friends I’ve acquired this means the third case is the most frequent. Due to many of my friends being in a similar situation, we are pretty proactive in planning these trips, having flights booked at least 6 weeks in advance, and hotels and such booked shortly after.

I have one friend however who hasn’t moved much since college. And they have a more carefree attitude in general. This has caused them to be unsure if they will meet me in a third place most times we’ve tried to arrange visits until the last possible minute. I’m usually the one who tries to plan but because of their nature they end up putting off making any concrete plans. The last time I went somewhere with the understanding I’d meet them there I landed with no hotel booked and they never arrived for some non-important reason that could have been foreseen.

Part of my plan to mitigate this and make sure this wouldn’t happen again was to book refundable tickets and ensure things were booked and split cost wise at least a week or two before departure. I didn’t directly communicate this rule to them, but instead pushed hard on getting things booked over the weekends. 

When they asked me how far in advance I could refund my airfare I mentioned that I would refund if we didn’t have at least hotels booked 2 weeks before departure. This occurred a little more than 3 weeks before departure. Their response was “cancel it then, I don’t like ultimatums.” They haven’t texted spoken to me since.

I understand that their life is very busy right now (they just started a new job), but my life is busy too, and I’m putting in the work to try and make this work. I only feel like I’m setting up boundaries for my own sake, and they are being selfish in wanting to keep me in the air until the lasts second. I guess I just want to see if what I said was truly an ultimatum, and if it was, was it even fair?

I understand that their life is very busy right now (they just started a new job), but my life is busy too, and I’m putting in the work to try and make this work. I only feel like I’m setting up boundaries for my own sake, and they are being selfish in wanting to keep me in the air until the lasts second. I guess I just want to see if what I said was truly an ultimatum, and if it was, was it even fair?

9,1d9xue7,AITA for telling my foster mom to stop telling people my business?,"me (18 F) got mad at my foster mom (42 F) because she won’t stop telling people that I am a foster kid and how good of a person she is because she decided to take me in. Last Wednesday my mother was talking to one of my friends parents who had no need to know I was a foster child and that my parents abandoned me when I was very young, and my friends parent told my friend and she told me and my group of friends what her mom told her and now they all refuse to hang out with me, after I figured that out I went to my mom to ask her if she really did this and she said she did and I got mad at her (this has been an ongoing issue I’ve told her to stop telling people) and she just won’t stop and I finally told her that thanks to her I now don’t have any friends and will be moving out soon. I feel kind of bad for yelling at her but AITA?

10,1d9xohn,AITA for yelling at my sister for sitting on my chair,"I (19X) and my sister (16F) live in a 2 story house with my mom and dad. I have been dealing with extreme pain in my feet for a while and my parents finally agreed to get me a wheelchair (manual, Amazon and not custom). 

On the first night of getting the wheelchair I stored it so it would be easy for me to access at the bottom of the stairs, near my bedroom, for in the morning. When I woke up the wheelchair had moved to the original spot it sat in where I had put it after assembling it.

I thought nothing of it since I have in the past seen dreams so vivid I thought they were reality and just thought I’d put it in the incorrect spot. So, I got in the wheelchair and moved to the kitchen where I was greeted by my sister. 

My sister, after seeing me in the wheelchair, chuckled a bit and said, “I played in your wheelchair last night, it’s not made for plus-sized people” 

Though she meant it lightly, and I understand her curiosity if the standard wheelchair size would fit her, I was outraged she has ‘played’ with medical equipment that was meant for me. I know I am not one who is known for my tone and voice level, but I meant to tell her in a calm voice to not ‘play’ with my medical equipment and I believe it came off more as me yelling at her. 

She responded to me saying, “it wasn’t a big deal” and I responded asking if she’d do it to someone else’s medical equipment, she replied, “but you’re my sister”

Sister may be a gendered term I’m usually okay with, but it bothered me in this instance and I may have uttered names and vulgar words under my breath (but not so quietly) and the confrontation ended there, but now I’m left wondering if I went too far and AITA?


Edit: me and my sister talked it through. I apologized for my reaction and she apologized for having sat in it. The question for AITA still stands, I just wanted to state that as the update ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-07,"AITA for yelling at my sister for sitting on my chair I (19X) and my sister (16F) live in a 2 story house with my mom and dad.

11,1d9xjkq,AITA Telling my parents what my sisters think goes into going out on our boat,"I want to know if AITA, I F17 and my 2 sisters F25 and F23 were arguing about me asking them to help me clean the boat, so my family owns a ski boat that we have owned and use over the summer for the past 4 years, where we live it is very dusty and get heavy rains in the winter so our boat gets very dirty, I clean the boat almost every weekend through out the summer so it's not covered in dirt/dust when we decide to go out, also the beginning of summer I take the cover off and clean everything from the cubbies under the seats, seats from mold, floor from mold and growing moss, spiderwebs, and re wax the leather seats (that's only the inside) then re wax the outside of the boat and clean the trailer. This takes at least 4 hours out of my day that I do alone and if the floor is flooded with water it takes another day to dry and reclean from the dust. Over the 4 years I am the only one to do this for the boat my parents are very appreciative of what I do put my sisters don't get how much it takes to keep it clean and to take the boat off and docked when we go out (they don't help with anything it's just me and my dad that do it and my mom parks the truck) so back to the topic I asked my sisters if they could help me clean the day before we go out because of all the dust F25 said if her friend is gone early then she will head over but also said ""Well that’s your chore. You don’t have any other chores. I’ve helped with gas n stuff last summer even when I didn’t have money so I don’t wanna hear it lol"" which I do other chores but I don't rub it in their faces so they don't know (dust, clean bathrooms, sweep, mop, do dishes) which I get where she is coming from she isn't really the problem but F23 decides to say  ""I’m with F25 on this one. I’m more than happy to contribute financially for gas and stuff. But cleaning it is definitely not our chore. And we don’t go on it every time. We do when we’re invited. And when we can.
