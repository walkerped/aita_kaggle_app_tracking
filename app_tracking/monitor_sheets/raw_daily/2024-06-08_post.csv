1,1db8cny,"AITA for ""excluding"" my gay adult nephew from my gay social events, when he says attending the events is a need for him, not a want?","My brother has two young adult children, Maisy, 19, and Cassidy, 18. I am a gay man in my 50s. Both Maisy and Cassidy are very young for their ages. They live out their lives entirely online, and neither of them have any real life friends. They are both very into fandoms around boy bands. They both have some interest in fashion which they follow on social media. 

Roughly 2 years ago Cassie announced identifying to be a male. As part of this Cassie changed fashion somewhat to be a kind of goth/glam / androgynous look. Cassie has long hair and wears a great deal of makeup and this did not change after the announcement, but Cassie began adding in a mustache and small goatee which were applied with makeup. 

  
I am part of a very tight-knit group of friends in this city who are all gay men. Cassie never showed much interest in my social life before but after his announcement he began asking to attend my social events. I told Cassie once he turned 18 he could come.

  
All of my friends are in their 40s and 50s and most of them are married with kids. We drink wine and talk about our lives and it's usually very domestic but it can get raunchy.

  
The first uncomfortable part was that anytime there was any reference to sex, Cassie would loudly huff and sigh and at one point rush out of the room. I'm presuming Cassie is not comfortable with sex but I was not going to babysit him as he is an adult.

  
Once Cassie had a glass or two of wine he loosened up more but it got a lot worse. The word ""f\*\*\*\*t"" started flowing out of Cassie's mouth non-stop. Cassie repeatedly talked about how every aspect of himself proved how he was such a ""f\*\*\*\*t"" and had always been one. Cassie brought up his love of fashion and boy bands as examples of this. 

  
This caused a stunned uncomfortable silence in the room. Each and every one of us in that room besides Cassie has been called that word before by someone who was in the midst of doing terrible things to us or threatening them. Cassie has never been in a position to be called that in any context. 

  
Ask Cassie had more wine he kept on changing the subject back to his boy bands. We are grown ups with interesting lives and none of us are interested in boy bands. Anytime the conversation strayed from fashion or boy bands Cassie hijacked it back as he got more drunk.

  
People started leaving and I was furious. Because Cassie is apparently terrified of confrontation I told my brother that Cassie will not be welcome back to any of my events until he grows up more. Apparently Cassie had a meltdown and said that he needed to attend these events to be part of his community and it was a need for him, not a want.

2,1db5w04,AITA for telling my sister I won’t change my hair color for her wedding?,"My younger sister (28f) is getting married, we just went out of town to watch her wedding dress shop (she did find the dress and say yes 🥰). We went out for drinks after to celebrate, and the conversation of my (33f) light lilac purple hair came up, I get a lot of compliments when I’m out, and I think she was already a little irritated that every wedding place loved my hair. Anyways she said I plan on asking you to be a bridesmaid in my wedding, but you can’t have purple hair, you’ll need to dye it brown, my response was, I worked really hard to achieve this color as it’s been my dream hair color for a very long time, and that I’m not dying it for one day, that it won’t hurt my feelings to not stand up there with her and her million friends, especially considering I’m making her wedding cake and was already planning on finishing the decorations the day of her wedding, I told her I’d have to scramble to finish her cake and get in for hair and makeup, and that I’m happy just sitting it out and making sure her cake is perfect. She snapped back with, your my sister and I want you up there, it won’t hurt you to dye it brown for a day, i love your hair but it’s my day and I want all the attention on me not your hair. I simply responded back with I still stand by my decision to sit this one out, and she just said well we have a year to discuss it…

There is absolutely nothing to discuss, I’m not dying my hair brown for a wedding, therefore I simply won’t be in my sisters wedding, AITA for not letting everyone’s opinions and guilts make me change my hair for her big day? 

Edit to add! 

During our conversation I did make a joke about wearing a wig, and she didn’t find that funny nor seemed keen on my solution, I also mentioned slicking my hair back into a low pretty bun so facing frontwards you wouldn’t really see much of my hair, that also wasn’t a good solution. I did also tell her I would consider lightening my hair to a silver platinum, and that way I could easily have it changed back to my lilac, I know it’s an issue because my mom was defending her stating it’s just hair and I can change to back from brown, not the case obviously, I’m dreading this conversation coming up again. 

I am a baker (side gig), and I happily offered to make their cake, it’s something I enjoy doing, it’s always been something we talked about was me making her cake! However it’s a very extravagant 4 tier cake that is going to be very flowered up, in my mind, I assumed I wouldn’t be asked to be a part of her wedding party since I told her the morning of her wedding I’ll stack the tiers and get the flowers placed how she wants, and I’d just be in my own little world getting that perfectly together.

3,1davv4o,WIBTA if I didn’t go to or discuss my mom’s art show?,"Anon for privacy. My mom wants to enter a local art show. She’s a really talented artist and I actually hope she does well. The problem is she wants to enter a painting she did of my teen as a child and my teen doesn’t want her to. My teen is trans and the picture is from before. We don’t have any pictures from before up in our home. My mom knows this. 

When my mom asked me about using the picture, I said I didn’t think my teen would like that. My mom said it’s her picture, she’s the artist. I acknowledged we couldn’t stop her but said that I’m guessing my teen would be uncomfortable and therefore wouldn’t want to go to the art show, or be able to be share in this experience and be excited for her. She was really quiet for a minute and moved on to talking about her other art that could be entered. I hoped that was the end of it. 

She called tonight and asked if she could talk to my teen about the art show, because she “wants to get an honest answer from him” not just how I think he would feel. I said no but that if she wanted, I’d talk to my teen on her behalf. My teen has been through a ridiculous amount of trauma recently (unrelated to being trans) and wouldn’t stand up for himself if she asked him directly.

She said “everyone she talked to has suggested this particular piece and thinks it has the best chance of winning.” I said I’m not trying to prevent her from winning. I’m telling her how I think my teen will react. I don’t want her to take it personally or for her feelings to be hurt if my teen is uncomfortable, unhappy, or won’t go to the showing because that’s about his identity, not about her art. She said her feelings are already hurt by my teen not wanting her to enter this piece and do well in the contest. Keep in mind, no one had even mentioned the contest to my teen yet. She’s saying her feelings are hurt by me warning her of how he might feel about a picture of before being made public. 

So I talked to my teen. My teen says he’s very uncomfortable with this but doesn’t feel like he has a right to stop her. But he does not want to go to the art showing or participate in discussion about the art showing. He wants to pretend it doesn’t exist. 

The picture is abstract, not identifying. Their last names are different. We are in the US, in a blue state. My teen and I do not think there is a safety risk but if we are wrong, please explain it to me well enough that I can explain it to my mom. 

WIBTA if I told my mom choosing to have the picture of my child from before in the contest means choosing to have us not participate in this? As in, we won’t go to the art show but also we won’t want to hear about it before or after. It’s not a topic we will be willing to discuss. I feel bad because we are her only local family and the first people she turns to for support but I am not willing to put my teen through this. He’s been through enough already. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-08,"WIBTA if I didn’t go to or discuss my mom’s art show? Anon for privacy. My mom wants to enter a local art show.

7,1dasbw7,AITA for pushing my boyfriend to go to Asia with me despite his concerns about his allergy?,"My (33M) boyfriend (34M) and I are together for almost 3 years. Last year I had the chance to visit Japan with a group of friends, but my boyfriend couldn’t join us at the time because we hadn’t planned too much in advance and he needed to save up – yet he told me before I left that he wanted for us to travel to Asia this year, and that I should save South Korea (he's a big Korean culture fan) for when we go together (some people in my friend group spent a week in South Korea, but I stayed in Japan the whole time with the understanding I'd be going with my boyfriend soon).

Well, now, after discussing about our upcoming trip - Japan + Korea - for months (and me taking the time to look for flights and create a schedule and search for accommodations), he finally told me that, even though he has the money put aside for the trip, he’s unsure about traveling to an Asian country. His main reason for having “cold feet” is because he has a serious shellfish allergy, can get a reaction even from an ingredient in some sauce or from sushi being cut with the same knife used to manipulate shellfish. He’s afraid we may not be able to communicate properly with the locals and this can be a risk to him.

I was very upset about this because he’s aware he’s allergic since his early teens, so if that’s something that could impact his/our travel plans, he could have told me that before I went on my trip last year, and I wouldn’t have stopped myself from going to a new country. He told me he didn’t start to see this as an issue until he began his own research on our destination, and that I seem more concerned about adjusting my travel expectations than I am with his health.

This wasn’t the first time his allergy caused some friction between us (he got upset with me a few months ago simply because I suggested he got retested to see if things had changed), but now I really felt justified in saying to him that he’s uninformed  (I’m sure there are many ways for us to make sure he will be safe during our trip - I mean, how many people with similar allergies travel all over the world and can manage just fine?), and that he must follow his agreement, because now he owes me a trip to Asia (I meant he ""owed"" me on a moral sense, not financially).

Me and my little brother Mikael (fake name & 4 years younger then me) lived with Ember (fake name) which treated us terribly by abusing us and making me do her work to keep the house since about 8 years old. She used to be a liar as well spouting lies of how my father never wanted me and how I'd never make it that far in life then would tell me she loved me making me feel guilty for harboring hate towards her. 

After many years of no contact she used Mikael to get my number to talk to her again. Ember succeeded after getting Mikael to rekindle the relationship they ""used to have"" before she gave up her rights to us after choosing her husband over us. I gave her 3 chances back then to stay in my life which she threw away making me give up on her. Now she asked for me to call her mom or call her my mother after every way she wronged me. 

She only came back after I got a real mom and she got jealous of her. I feel guilty for being so blunt and letting my anger and the past taint my chats with her but I can't help but feel justified in not wishing for a relationship with her. She pretends like she cares but why would she care now? Am I the arse for not calling her my mother or mom?",0.0,-0.014751657,0,1

It was late midnight for me so I fell asleep afterwards and the next day I got betrayed by another friend that I bought tickets to visit. The severe stress of graduating at a deadline along with that caused me to develop health issues. 

I didn't text her back and I sat down to finish my graduation and wasn't on my phone at all, only if someone called me. Which she didn't.

She messaged me again on May 22nd and I replied 2 hours later when I woke up. We had a brief chat and she left me on seen. I contact her again a few days ago and she tells me I'm a jerk for ghosting her for a month and that we aren't compatible as friends.

I apologized and explained it to her what happened but she just said there was absolutely no way anyone could convince her that anyone's that busy not to text back. Honestly we aren't even close and see each other once every 2 months.

I claimed I feel guilty, explained and apologized and said she never set any specific expectations of our friendship. But she doesn't seem to want to hear it and now I look like a jerk that left a friend stranded. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-08,"AITA for not replying to my friend's message for a month?

10,1das9uz,AITA for insisting my family rinses their dishes?,"Dear fellow possible a-holes,
My husband and I have been going the rounds about rinsing off the dishes when you’re done eating so they don’t end up with crusted on food on them making them, in my opinion, much harder to clean. It also irritates the shit out of me that my family throws dishes with food on them in the side of the sink with no garbage disposal. WHY!!! My husband flat out refuses to do it. It’s a continual argument. His excuses are one of two things - 1) there are dishes in the sink and it’s full (right after dinner, for example) so I’m not going to rinse my dish if there are any dishes in the sink. (He throws it in the side with no disposal or sets it on the counter or leaves it on the table) Argument 2) If you’re making me wash cheese and stuff off the plate then I’m basically “washing the dishes” (I only ask that he rinses HIS dish) and it’s not my turn to wash the dishes. He does do dishes weekly - that’s not the complaint. My problem is that he would rather argue about it than take 10 seconds away from his life to actually than to rinse the damn thing off so it’s not gross when the rest of us have to wash them. Damn near everyone I know rinses off their plates. It’s a pretty basic request. He’s going to die on his “no rinsing”  hill. I will die on mine.

12,1das2e8,AITA for not washing the dishes?,"So in our household, we have a specific schedule for our chores, with each of us at home doing a different chore at different times of the day, and depending on what day it is.

It was decided that my sister would wash the dishes for breakfast, me for lunch, and my mother for dinner.

It was an okay system with no complaints from us, sometimes me or my sister would wash my mother's dishes for her, or we would sometimes take over our chores between the both of us.

We don't do this every time, we just volunteer sometimes when it's no trouble to do.

Last night though, we didn't wash her dishes that night because I just didn't feel like it, but I don't know my sis' reasons, then in the morning, my mom notices and she gets mad.

She started ranting about us not being hard workers, about how doing it should be automatic, especially when she was already so tired from working yesterday (we genuinely didn't notice, she didn't do anything new from what we saw), and ""are you gonna be like your aunts and uncles, laying about not being able to do anything for themselves?""
""Will you just lay around and let me do all the work all the time since 'oh, she can handle it'?""

I personally thought she was being unfair, that to wash her dishes isn't our duty, and it's not like we never do it for her either, just not last night, and I feel like she doesn't have the right to be mad?
We wouldn't have hated doing it, if she asked us ""Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really tired today, could you wash my dishes for me?"" I would've done it, no complaints.

I didn't voice any of that though.

""It's like you never got used to this."" ""Just let her anger blow off, it'll pass."" 

And for the longest time, that's exactly what I did.
Anytime she goes on rants, even when I think she's being unfair, I stay quiet.

Well, today he decided to take work calls downstairs following his lunch break and when the kids woke up I heard him on the phone so I kept them upstairs. 30 minutes later (around 3:35p)he’s still on the phone and so I figured I’d just run downstairs to get the kids a banana to hold them over.

I told him he should be working at his desk in the room where the kids and I don’t disturb him. He got SO mad and said he can go anywhere he wants & if he’s on a work call I need to stay upstairs.

The kids and I were hungry and I waited a good 30-40 min after their wake up time. I didn’t know how much longer he’d be. I think he needs to understand that if he has an important call then it should be made at his desk because the kids and I have to also eat and live.

So the dog was staying in the car, and i was able to take her before it started getting really hot here. I agreed to keep her for two weeks, hopefully less as her owner asked. I met the dog in the parking lot and she was very scared and skittish, tail between her legs and cowering. She contacted me about two weeks later asking me to take the dog, crying because the people that currently had her were going to take her to the pound. 

I agreed and picked her up with some food, a leash, and a toy provided by the owner. A few days into her being with me, she really blossomed. not scared anymore, and i had transitioned her to a MUCH better quality food (purina puppy chow is what she was sent with, we determined she’s allergic to it as she had stopped itching since we switched), and she had another dog to play with. 

The lady has only responded to my texts once in the last two weeks, i’ve been trying to find out how the apartment search is going, if i can help, i told her i would help her find a motel that accepts dogs if she still hadn’t found anything at the end of the two weeks. Nothing, absolute radio silence. i know she’s getting the texts because i saw her once since i picked up the dog and she answered my most recent text to my face.

We have been dealing with his ex girlfriend harassing us for the past year and a half, since we first started our relationship.

 She and him dated 7 years ago for 2 years and decided to try and be friends after they dated.  They broke up because she was mean to him often and was wearing on his mental health. 

Although she has a new boyfriend, she doesn’t want him seeing anyone new. She is completely nuts and had a phase of calling him 50+ times in a row, sending aggressive messages, and telling him she still loves him and can’t bear to see him post photos with me online because she misses him.

He has been totally transparent with me about her weird messages, even gave me his phone password and and told me I can check his phone anytime if I feel curious about the weird stuff she’s said (I have no desire to read her messages but it was a nice gesture to make sure I feel like I’m not in the dark about what was going on).

 He eventually told her to stop harassing him and blocked her on everything. He did show me some of the stuff she was saying a few times, and it was not very nice about me. She doesn’t know me at all, but she found my social media and was screenshotting my selfies and sending them to him, making mean remarks about my body. This is where he drew the line and blocked her and went no contact.

Ok so here’s the problem. She has a bunch of collage art she made and gave to him, and it’s all sitting in a box in our home. He told me feels too bad to get rid of it, and I feel hurt that he’s holding onto the art of someone who made rude remarks about my body and tried to
Get in the middle of our relationship. If she was a normal ex girlfriend who was cordial about him being with me, I’d have absolutely no issue with him keeping the art. I personally would trash anyone’s art if they were mean about my partners body or tried to get in between us. She was so disrespectful about me, I don’t understand why he wants to be respectful to her art.

He said he can see my POV but he also feels too bad to throw it out and the box is still sitting there in our storage area where I have to walk by it often, and it reminds me of her cruel words.

 She and him dated 7 years ago for 2 years and decided to try and be friends after they dated.  They broke up because she was mean to him often and was wearing on his mental health. 

Although she has a new boyfriend, she doesn’t want him seeing anyone new. She is completely nuts and had a phase of calling him 50+ times in a row, sending aggressive messages, and telling him she still loves him and can’t bear to see him post photos with me online because she misses him.

He has been totally transparent with me about her weird messages, even gave me his phone password and and told me I can check his phone anytime if I feel curious about the weird stuff she’s said (I have no desire to read her messages but it was a nice gesture to make sure I feel like I’m not in the dark about what was going on).

 He eventually told her to stop harassing him and blocked her on everything. He did show me some of the stuff she was saying a few times, and it was not very nice about me. She doesn’t know me at all, but she found my social media and was screenshotting my selfies and sending them to him, making mean remarks about my body. This is where he drew the line and blocked her and went no contact.

Ok so here’s the problem. She has a bunch of collage art she made and gave to him, and it’s all sitting in a box in our home. He told me feels too bad to get rid of it, and I feel hurt that he’s holding onto the art of someone who made rude remarks about my body and tried to
Get in the middle of our relationship. If she was a normal ex girlfriend who was cordial about him being with me, I’d have absolutely no issue with him keeping the art. I personally would trash anyone’s art if they were mean about my partners body or tried to get in between us. She was so disrespectful about me, I don’t understand why he wants to be respectful to her art.

He said he can see my POV but he also feels too bad to throw it out and the box is still sitting there in our storage area where I have to walk by it often, and it reminds me of her cruel words.

17,1daqxbv,AITA for refusing to help my father financially?,"My (28F) father (57M) has always been bad with money. My mom passed away 4 years ago and I think she kept things afloat, because he has been out of control since. He supposedly paid off their debt and mortgage with her life insurance payout, but during that time I noticed that him and his new gf(that he met 3 months after my mom died) were going on vacations and making other large purchases. Along with all that, he was making more and more comments about how much money my sister (16F) was costing him and how she's ungrateful(blah blah). 

So this morning I get a message from his gf asking me to help them with monthly expenses since she doesn't want to anymore. I am pretty sure it is because my dad got injured a month or so ago and she has had to take care of him, which she doesn't want to do. So now she is trying to guilt trip me into giving them money by saying things like ""I would do anything for my dad"" and ""How can you live with yourself"". The thing is that I know my dad and her are heavy drinkers and smokers and that most of his income goes to booze every month. We're talking CASES of vodka and brandy at a time not just a bottle here and there, but then they'll complain when my sister needs new shoes. I refuse to enable his addiction, but I feel like TA because I know he needs help and they might lose the house since he's getting behind on payments. I always make sure my sister is taken care of, but I have honestly hit an emotional wall with my dad where I just can't get myself to care anymore. They have done some pretty awful things to me and my sister over the last few years.

18,1daqrkw,AITA for asking my fiancé not to drink,"My fiancé (m27) and I (f23) have been together for almost a year now. At first he drank with his friends every once in a while because they are big on gaming so they would game, drink, and stay up all night. I never saw a problem with it being that I knew he was just trying to relax and hang out with the boys. A couple months gone by and we got a place together. We’ve been living together for about 5 months now and the drinking has became more of a problem. He buys whiskey during the day or if he’s getting off work at night he will go and grab beer from the gas station right up the road on the way home. He has drank every night except maybe a weeks worth ever since we started living together. I’ve never been with someone who drinks so much and I rarely drink so I don’t say anything knowing that it’s his way of relaxing. I’ve also had a bad experience in my childhood where my father was very mentally abusive to my mom because of drugs and alcohol. We’re also in a financial situation (like the rest of the world) where each month we barely make it by to pay our bills because we work in a place that pays a lot less than most places. So I had brought it up to him one night about me not liking the drinking every night. He just sat and listened to me talk and cry for about half an hour about it while he never said a word. After a moment of silence he had brushed it off like it didn’t happen and told me that our daughter needed to go to bed. We didn’t talk the rest of the night and the conversation continued to the next day when I was at work. We texted all day while I was working and when I got home barely any talking happened. He mixed up my words and tried to tell me that I thought his gaming was a problem so he tried to sell his PC (so he says). I had tried to explain to him that I was worried for us with our money, our relationship, his relationship with our daughter, and his health. He told me that he was gonna stop everything but he said it in a tone where I knew he was trying to make me the bad guy. I finally got fed up and told him to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. About an hour later he went to play his games and I watched like nothing happened. AITA??

19,1daqfmp,AITA for not attending my friend's two weddings?,"\[edited for length\]

I (36F) have a situation with one of my bffs (45M) that I think is putting a wedge between us. My friend, let’s call him Adam, got married to Eve (38F) 1.5 years ago. They had 2 weddings (a normal one and a Chinese one) and I was invited to both. I’ve been a really close friend of Adam’s for many years. We used to live in the same city and Adam would always invite me as his “date” to galas and other events, take me to nice dinners, introduce me to really interesting people like professional athletes, artists and other people he knows. And before you ask— we never dated, while he has a heart of gold Adam isn’t my type. We did make out once or twice, but nothing serious. I moved to a city a few hours away and since then I haven’t seen Adam as often, though we still text regularly. About 3 years ago he met Eve and had a whirlwind relationship and got engaged after about a year. I haven’t met Eve but she seems nice enough, though I get the sense her travel schedule between her homes is part of why I never see Adam anymore.

Now, to the wedding. Adam used to make my birthday a REALLY big deal — we’d always go out and go to a really nice show and a high end meal, dress up etc. I guess for me it was always a bit like our friendship anniversary night. So I was surprised when I saw the first wedding was supposedly taking place on my birthday weekend. I called Adam and told him would he think about changing the date, because I was planning something with friends in my city and I couldn’t imagine him not coming. He had never been to my city before and I thought now that my live-in boyfriend and I called it quits, he could come stay the weekend, too, and see my city and life around here. It was only a “save the date,” so I figured there was still time to change it and it wasn’t even the big Chinese one. When we talked on the phone, not only did he say he couldn’t change the date, but also he refused to honor my request to not invite an ex of mine (I will not attend any event with this man there, and Adam knows this). I admit I might have gotten heated on the phone.

A few months after that, Adam texted me if I’m going to attend the Asian wedding and if I can update my RSVP one way or another since there’s a lot of people to account for. I just ignored him because I felt so disrespected from the last time we talked, and figured with all the relatives and aunties coming over from China that he wouldn’t be able to get an accurate headcount anyway. I did send him a nice entryway mat for his house off the gift registry just to try to smooth things over.

Since then, we still text pretty frequently but I feel things are “off” and I miss the connection we used to have. Adam recently visited my city for some job-related stuff and didn’t even make time to hang out. I’m beginning to wonder if maybe I was too harsh in declining to come to both his weddings and that’s hurt our friendship.

20,1daq9o9,AITA for telling my sister she is being sexist?,"My bf and I are 17. Love him a lot and he is the sweetest, best person on the planet. 

But yes. We had a problem in the past where someone in high school picked a fight with me. It was just classic bullying, she was making fun of my appearance and what I was wearing and asked if I got it from Walmart.

It was stupid, but my bf immediately jumped in and told her to mind her that I looked beautiful and she should leave me the fuck alone.

I turned to him and said I could defend myself, I didn't need him to speak up for me, and told said girl that he was right and she should leave me the fuck alone because she really wasn't looking at that amazing herself.

He said he was sorry about it later. I actually really appreciated that he stood up for me, especially because said girl use to be one of his friends, but that I would prefer that he didn't because I can defend myself.

But yeah, later I went to a party with my sister, bf, and a couple of friends.

I had a friend at the party later that made a shitty comment at me. He's a friend of my bf's and I think it just came out bad because he was drinking.

I said I had plans to go on a college trip somewhere, alone, and he said something like, ""Traveling alone? You don't get any friends, do you? I mean, it's you. Of course you don't.""

I could see my bf went to say something, but he stopped himself. I honestly just took it in good fun. I said something like lay off the alcohol, it turns you into an asshole. Oh wait you're always like that.

The point is I didn't need defending but later my sister said my bf was such an asshole. I was so confused and asked what she could mean. She said he should have defended me from what that friend said, he just stood there and let you respond and made an awkward face.

I told her that I prefer to defend myself, having my bf need to come in and defend me from a comment like that is embarassing. I said she was coming off sexist, like I need a man to defend my honor or something. Like I'm incapable of doing it myself and my bf needs to do it.

For context i was on call with my bf before and we both fell asleep. And usually my mother wakes me up again around 2am to go down and sleep in other room. Why? I have no idea... she is also too concerned to go to sleep herself until i do it. 

I am diabetic but i always check my sugar when i feel sleepy, and multiple times i tried to tell her that she dosent have to do this but it just ends up with her being offended

Ofc i love my mom but i just need BIT more of freedom. She had very traumatic life and she is extremely scared of ppl leaving her. But being conditioned like this just makes me wish to pull away. 

But it feels like i am sucha pice of sht. Now I still can hear her walking downstairs and i feel so incredibly guilty for everything. And i know she would never allow me nd my bf to travel together alone if she makes sucha fuss over THIS. 

I am honestly just so so tierd of everything and honestly it feels like i shouldn't exist and that feeling that i am legit biggest spoiled ungrateful pice of shit ever. 

I feel so guilty for hurting ppl but i guess my nervs are bit weak lately heh 

UPDATE 
Okay so i was bit overwhelmed and under emotions last night writing this.

My mother had pretty bad anxiety due to many terrible experiences she had in youth. And the thing is i understand why is she being that way like i get it.
The thing ks she is still my mother and i dont want to hurt her especially coz she doesn't have bad intentions. 

I am type 1 diabetes for about 10ish years. And i mostly know how to take care of it. I am on insulin pens therapy as that is only thing supported here.

It just kinda scares me she is so so attached or sensitive beacuse i honestly dont know how she will take me becoming full on grown up. 

And that just makes me feel terrible and guilty. But logically speaking i need to convince her to speak with somebody professional about this things. Coz it helped a bit in the past before she quited. And get her some friends. 

Idk i just first need to find way to solve my own feelings around this, and be okay with ""being bad person"" for a bit.
