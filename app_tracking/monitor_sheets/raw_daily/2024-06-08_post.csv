1,1db8cny,"AITA for ""excluding"" my gay adult nephew from my gay social events, when he says attending the events is a need for him, not a want?","My brother has two young adult children, Maisy, 19, and Cassidy, 18. I am a gay man in my 50s. Both Maisy and Cassidy are very young for their ages. They live out their lives entirely online, and neither of them have any real life friends. They are both very into fandoms around boy bands. They both have some interest in fashion which they follow on social media. 

Roughly 2 years ago Cassie announced identifying to be a male. As part of this Cassie changed fashion somewhat to be a kind of goth/glam / androgynous look. Cassie has long hair and wears a great deal of makeup and this did not change after the announcement, but Cassie began adding in a mustache and small goatee which were applied with makeup. 

  
I am part of a very tight-knit group of friends in this city who are all gay men. Cassie never showed much interest in my social life before but after his announcement he began asking to attend my social events. I told Cassie once he turned 18 he could come.

  
All of my friends are in their 40s and 50s and most of them are married with kids. We drink wine and talk about our lives and it's usually very domestic but it can get raunchy.

  
The first uncomfortable part was that anytime there was any reference to sex, Cassie would loudly huff and sigh and at one point rush out of the room. I'm presuming Cassie is not comfortable with sex but I was not going to babysit him as he is an adult.

  
Once Cassie had a glass or two of wine he loosened up more but it got a lot worse. The word ""f\*\*\*\*t"" started flowing out of Cassie's mouth non-stop. Cassie repeatedly talked about how every aspect of himself proved how he was such a ""f\*\*\*\*t"" and had always been one. Cassie brought up his love of fashion and boy bands as examples of this. 

  
This caused a stunned uncomfortable silence in the room. Each and every one of us in that room besides Cassie has been called that word before by someone who was in the midst of doing terrible things to us or threatening them. Cassie has never been in a position to be called that in any context. 

  
Ask Cassie had more wine he kept on changing the subject back to his boy bands. We are grown ups with interesting lives and none of us are interested in boy bands. Anytime the conversation strayed from fashion or boy bands Cassie hijacked it back as he got more drunk.

  
People started leaving and I was furious. Because Cassie is apparently terrified of confrontation I told my brother that Cassie will not be welcome back to any of my events until he grows up more. Apparently Cassie had a meltdown and said that he needed to attend these events to be part of his community and it was a need for him, not a want.

2,1db5w04,AITA for telling my sister I won’t change my hair color for her wedding?,"My younger sister (28f) is getting married, we just went out of town to watch her wedding dress shop (she did find the dress and say yes 🥰). We went out for drinks after to celebrate, and the conversation of my (33f) light lilac purple hair came up, I get a lot of compliments when I’m out, and I think she was already a little irritated that every wedding place loved my hair. Anyways she said I plan on asking you to be a bridesmaid in my wedding, but you can’t have purple hair, you’ll need to dye it brown, my response was, I worked really hard to achieve this color as it’s been my dream hair color for a very long time, and that I’m not dying it for one day, that it won’t hurt my feelings to not stand up there with her and her million friends, especially considering I’m making her wedding cake and was already planning on finishing the decorations the day of her wedding, I told her I’d have to scramble to finish her cake and get in for hair and makeup, and that I’m happy just sitting it out and making sure her cake is perfect. She snapped back with, your my sister and I want you up there, it won’t hurt you to dye it brown for a day, i love your hair but it’s my day and I want all the attention on me not your hair. I simply responded back with I still stand by my decision to sit this one out, and she just said well we have a year to discuss it…

There is absolutely nothing to discuss, I’m not dying my hair brown for a wedding, therefore I simply won’t be in my sisters wedding, AITA for not letting everyone’s opinions and guilts make me change my hair for her big day? 

Edit to add! 

During our conversation I did make a joke about wearing a wig, and she didn’t find that funny nor seemed keen on my solution, I also mentioned slicking my hair back into a low pretty bun so facing frontwards you wouldn’t really see much of my hair, that also wasn’t a good solution. I did also tell her I would consider lightening my hair to a silver platinum, and that way I could easily have it changed back to my lilac, I know it’s an issue because my mom was defending her stating it’s just hair and I can change to back from brown, not the case obviously, I’m dreading this conversation coming up again. 

I am a baker (side gig), and I happily offered to make their cake, it’s something I enjoy doing, it’s always been something we talked about was me making her cake! However it’s a very extravagant 4 tier cake that is going to be very flowered up, in my mind, I assumed I wouldn’t be asked to be a part of her wedding party since I told her the morning of her wedding I’ll stack the tiers and get the flowers placed how she wants, and I’d just be in my own little world getting that perfectly together.

3,1davv4o,WIBTA if I didn’t go to or discuss my mom’s art show?,"Anon for privacy. My mom wants to enter a local art show. She’s a really talented artist and I actually hope she does well. The problem is she wants to enter a painting she did of my teen as a child and my teen doesn’t want her to. My teen is trans and the picture is from before. We don’t have any pictures from before up in our home. My mom knows this. 

When my mom asked me about using the picture, I said I didn’t think my teen would like that. My mom said it’s her picture, she’s the artist. I acknowledged we couldn’t stop her but said that I’m guessing my teen would be uncomfortable and therefore wouldn’t want to go to the art show, or be able to be share in this experience and be excited for her. She was really quiet for a minute and moved on to talking about her other art that could be entered. I hoped that was the end of it. 

She called tonight and asked if she could talk to my teen about the art show, because she “wants to get an honest answer from him” not just how I think he would feel. I said no but that if she wanted, I’d talk to my teen on her behalf. My teen has been through a ridiculous amount of trauma recently (unrelated to being trans) and wouldn’t stand up for himself if she asked him directly.

She said “everyone she talked to has suggested this particular piece and thinks it has the best chance of winning.” I said I’m not trying to prevent her from winning. I’m telling her how I think my teen will react. I don’t want her to take it personally or for her feelings to be hurt if my teen is uncomfortable, unhappy, or won’t go to the showing because that’s about his identity, not about her art. She said her feelings are already hurt by my teen not wanting her to enter this piece and do well in the contest. Keep in mind, no one had even mentioned the contest to my teen yet. She’s saying her feelings are hurt by me warning her of how he might feel about a picture of before being made public. 

So I talked to my teen. My teen says he’s very uncomfortable with this but doesn’t feel like he has a right to stop her. But he does not want to go to the art showing or participate in discussion about the art showing. He wants to pretend it doesn’t exist. 

The picture is abstract, not identifying. Their last names are different. We are in the US, in a blue state. My teen and I do not think there is a safety risk but if we are wrong, please explain it to me well enough that I can explain it to my mom. 

WIBTA if I told my mom choosing to have the picture of my child from before in the contest means choosing to have us not participate in this? As in, we won’t go to the art show but also we won’t want to hear about it before or after. It’s not a topic we will be willing to discuss. I feel bad because we are her only local family and the first people she turns to for support but I am not willing to put my teen through this. He’s been through enough already. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-08,"WIBTA if I didn’t go to or discuss my mom’s art show? Anon for privacy. My mom wants to enter a local art show.

7,1dasbw7,AITA for pushing my boyfriend to go to Asia with me despite his concerns about his allergy?,"My (33M) boyfriend (34M) and I are together for almost 3 years. Last year I had the chance to visit Japan with a group of friends, but my boyfriend couldn’t join us at the time because we hadn’t planned too much in advance and he needed to save up – yet he told me before I left that he wanted for us to travel to Asia this year, and that I should save South Korea (he's a big Korean culture fan) for when we go together (some people in my friend group spent a week in South Korea, but I stayed in Japan the whole time with the understanding I'd be going with my boyfriend soon).

Well, now, after discussing about our upcoming trip - Japan + Korea - for months (and me taking the time to look for flights and create a schedule and search for accommodations), he finally told me that, even though he has the money put aside for the trip, he’s unsure about traveling to an Asian country. His main reason for having “cold feet” is because he has a serious shellfish allergy, can get a reaction even from an ingredient in some sauce or from sushi being cut with the same knife used to manipulate shellfish. He’s afraid we may not be able to communicate properly with the locals and this can be a risk to him.

I was very upset about this because he’s aware he’s allergic since his early teens, so if that’s something that could impact his/our travel plans, he could have told me that before I went on my trip last year, and I wouldn’t have stopped myself from going to a new country. He told me he didn’t start to see this as an issue until he began his own research on our destination, and that I seem more concerned about adjusting my travel expectations than I am with his health.

This wasn’t the first time his allergy caused some friction between us (he got upset with me a few months ago simply because I suggested he got retested to see if things had changed), but now I really felt justified in saying to him that he’s uninformed  (I’m sure there are many ways for us to make sure he will be safe during our trip - I mean, how many people with similar allergies travel all over the world and can manage just fine?), and that he must follow his agreement, because now he owes me a trip to Asia (I meant he ""owed"" me on a moral sense, not financially).

Me and my little brother Mikael (fake name & 4 years younger then me) lived with Ember (fake name) which treated us terribly by abusing us and making me do her work to keep the house since about 8 years old. She used to be a liar as well spouting lies of how my father never wanted me and how I'd never make it that far in life then would tell me she loved me making me feel guilty for harboring hate towards her. 

After many years of no contact she used Mikael to get my number to talk to her again. Ember succeeded after getting Mikael to rekindle the relationship they ""used to have"" before she gave up her rights to us after choosing her husband over us. I gave her 3 chances back then to stay in my life which she threw away making me give up on her. Now she asked for me to call her mom or call her my mother after every way she wronged me. 

She only came back after I got a real mom and she got jealous of her. I feel guilty for being so blunt and letting my anger and the past taint my chats with her but I can't help but feel justified in not wishing for a relationship with her. She pretends like she cares but why would she care now? Am I the arse for not calling her my mother or mom?",0.0,-0.014751657,0,1

It was late midnight for me so I fell asleep afterwards and the next day I got betrayed by another friend that I bought tickets to visit. The severe stress of graduating at a deadline along with that caused me to develop health issues. 

I didn't text her back and I sat down to finish my graduation and wasn't on my phone at all, only if someone called me. Which she didn't.

She messaged me again on May 22nd and I replied 2 hours later when I woke up. We had a brief chat and she left me on seen. I contact her again a few days ago and she tells me I'm a jerk for ghosting her for a month and that we aren't compatible as friends.

I apologized and explained it to her what happened but she just said there was absolutely no way anyone could convince her that anyone's that busy not to text back. Honestly we aren't even close and see each other once every 2 months.

I claimed I feel guilty, explained and apologized and said she never set any specific expectations of our friendship. But she doesn't seem to want to hear it and now I look like a jerk that left a friend stranded. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-08,"AITA for not replying to my friend's message for a month?

10,1das9uz,AITA for insisting my family rinses their dishes?,"Dear fellow possible a-holes,
My husband and I have been going the rounds about rinsing off the dishes when you’re done eating so they don’t end up with crusted on food on them making them, in my opinion, much harder to clean. It also irritates the shit out of me that my family throws dishes with food on them in the side of the sink with no garbage disposal. WHY!!! My husband flat out refuses to do it. It’s a continual argument. His excuses are one of two things - 1) there are dishes in the sink and it’s full (right after dinner, for example) so I’m not going to rinse my dish if there are any dishes in the sink. (He throws it in the side with no disposal or sets it on the counter or leaves it on the table) Argument 2) If you’re making me wash cheese and stuff off the plate then I’m basically “washing the dishes” (I only ask that he rinses HIS dish) and it’s not my turn to wash the dishes. He does do dishes weekly - that’s not the complaint. My problem is that he would rather argue about it than take 10 seconds away from his life to actually than to rinse the damn thing off so it’s not gross when the rest of us have to wash them. Damn near everyone I know rinses off their plates. It’s a pretty basic request. He’s going to die on his “no rinsing”  hill. I will die on mine.

12,1das2e8,AITA for not washing the dishes?,"So in our household, we have a specific schedule for our chores, with each of us at home doing a different chore at different times of the day, and depending on what day it is.

It was decided that my sister would wash the dishes for breakfast, me for lunch, and my mother for dinner.

It was an okay system with no complaints from us, sometimes me or my sister would wash my mother's dishes for her, or we would sometimes take over our chores between the both of us.

We don't do this every time, we just volunteer sometimes when it's no trouble to do.

Last night though, we didn't wash her dishes that night because I just didn't feel like it, but I don't know my sis' reasons, then in the morning, my mom notices and she gets mad.

She started ranting about us not being hard workers, about how doing it should be automatic, especially when she was already so tired from working yesterday (we genuinely didn't notice, she didn't do anything new from what we saw), and ""are you gonna be like your aunts and uncles, laying about not being able to do anything for themselves?""
""Will you just lay around and let me do all the work all the time since 'oh, she can handle it'?""

I personally thought she was being unfair, that to wash her dishes isn't our duty, and it's not like we never do it for her either, just not last night, and I feel like she doesn't have the right to be mad?
We wouldn't have hated doing it, if she asked us ""Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really tired today, could you wash my dishes for me?"" I would've done it, no complaints.

I didn't voice any of that though.

""It's like you never got used to this."" ""Just let her anger blow off, it'll pass."" 

And for the longest time, that's exactly what I did.
Anytime she goes on rants, even when I think she's being unfair, I stay quiet.

Well, today he decided to take work calls downstairs following his lunch break and when the kids woke up I heard him on the phone so I kept them upstairs. 30 minutes later (around 3:35p)he’s still on the phone and so I figured I’d just run downstairs to get the kids a banana to hold them over.

I told him he should be working at his desk in the room where the kids and I don’t disturb him. He got SO mad and said he can go anywhere he wants & if he’s on a work call I need to stay upstairs.

The kids and I were hungry and I waited a good 30-40 min after their wake up time. I didn’t know how much longer he’d be. I think he needs to understand that if he has an important call then it should be made at his desk because the kids and I have to also eat and live.

So the dog was staying in the car, and i was able to take her before it started getting really hot here. I agreed to keep her for two weeks, hopefully less as her owner asked. I met the dog in the parking lot and she was very scared and skittish, tail between her legs and cowering. She contacted me about two weeks later asking me to take the dog, crying because the people that currently had her were going to take her to the pound. 

I agreed and picked her up with some food, a leash, and a toy provided by the owner. A few days into her being with me, she really blossomed. not scared anymore, and i had transitioned her to a MUCH better quality food (purina puppy chow is what she was sent with, we determined she’s allergic to it as she had stopped itching since we switched), and she had another dog to play with. 

The lady has only responded to my texts once in the last two weeks, i’ve been trying to find out how the apartment search is going, if i can help, i told her i would help her find a motel that accepts dogs if she still hadn’t found anything at the end of the two weeks. Nothing, absolute radio silence. i know she’s getting the texts because i saw her once since i picked up the dog and she answered my most recent text to my face.

We have been dealing with his ex girlfriend harassing us for the past year and a half, since we first started our relationship.

 She and him dated 7 years ago for 2 years and decided to try and be friends after they dated.  They broke up because she was mean to him often and was wearing on his mental health. 

Although she has a new boyfriend, she doesn’t want him seeing anyone new. She is completely nuts and had a phase of calling him 50+ times in a row, sending aggressive messages, and telling him she still loves him and can’t bear to see him post photos with me online because she misses him.

He has been totally transparent with me about her weird messages, even gave me his phone password and and told me I can check his phone anytime if I feel curious about the weird stuff she’s said (I have no desire to read her messages but it was a nice gesture to make sure I feel like I’m not in the dark about what was going on).

 He eventually told her to stop harassing him and blocked her on everything. He did show me some of the stuff she was saying a few times, and it was not very nice about me. She doesn’t know me at all, but she found my social media and was screenshotting my selfies and sending them to him, making mean remarks about my body. This is where he drew the line and blocked her and went no contact.

Ok so here’s the problem. She has a bunch of collage art she made and gave to him, and it’s all sitting in a box in our home. He told me feels too bad to get rid of it, and I feel hurt that he’s holding onto the art of someone who made rude remarks about my body and tried to
Get in the middle of our relationship. If she was a normal ex girlfriend who was cordial about him being with me, I’d have absolutely no issue with him keeping the art. I personally would trash anyone’s art if they were mean about my partners body or tried to get in between us. She was so disrespectful about me, I don’t understand why he wants to be respectful to her art.

He said he can see my POV but he also feels too bad to throw it out and the box is still sitting there in our storage area where I have to walk by it often, and it reminds me of her cruel words.

 She and him dated 7 years ago for 2 years and decided to try and be friends after they dated.  They broke up because she was mean to him often and was wearing on his mental health. 

Although she has a new boyfriend, she doesn’t want him seeing anyone new. She is completely nuts and had a phase of calling him 50+ times in a row, sending aggressive messages, and telling him she still loves him and can’t bear to see him post photos with me online because she misses him.

He has been totally transparent with me about her weird messages, even gave me his phone password and and told me I can check his phone anytime if I feel curious about the weird stuff she’s said (I have no desire to read her messages but it was a nice gesture to make sure I feel like I’m not in the dark about what was going on).

 He eventually told her to stop harassing him and blocked her on everything. He did show me some of the stuff she was saying a few times, and it was not very nice about me. She doesn’t know me at all, but she found my social media and was screenshotting my selfies and sending them to him, making mean remarks about my body. This is where he drew the line and blocked her and went no contact.

Ok so here’s the problem. She has a bunch of collage art she made and gave to him, and it’s all sitting in a box in our home. He told me feels too bad to get rid of it, and I feel hurt that he’s holding onto the art of someone who made rude remarks about my body and tried to
Get in the middle of our relationship. If she was a normal ex girlfriend who was cordial about him being with me, I’d have absolutely no issue with him keeping the art. I personally would trash anyone’s art if they were mean about my partners body or tried to get in between us. She was so disrespectful about me, I don’t understand why he wants to be respectful to her art.

He said he can see my POV but he also feels too bad to throw it out and the box is still sitting there in our storage area where I have to walk by it often, and it reminds me of her cruel words.

17,1daqxbv,AITA for refusing to help my father financially?,"My (28F) father (57M) has always been bad with money. My mom passed away 4 years ago and I think she kept things afloat, because he has been out of control since. He supposedly paid off their debt and mortgage with her life insurance payout, but during that time I noticed that him and his new gf(that he met 3 months after my mom died) were going on vacations and making other large purchases. Along with all that, he was making more and more comments about how much money my sister (16F) was costing him and how she's ungrateful(blah blah). 

So this morning I get a message from his gf asking me to help them with monthly expenses since she doesn't want to anymore. I am pretty sure it is because my dad got injured a month or so ago and she has had to take care of him, which she doesn't want to do. So now she is trying to guilt trip me into giving them money by saying things like ""I would do anything for my dad"" and ""How can you live with yourself"". The thing is that I know my dad and her are heavy drinkers and smokers and that most of his income goes to booze every month. We're talking CASES of vodka and brandy at a time not just a bottle here and there, but then they'll complain when my sister needs new shoes. I refuse to enable his addiction, but I feel like TA because I know he needs help and they might lose the house since he's getting behind on payments. I always make sure my sister is taken care of, but I have honestly hit an emotional wall with my dad where I just can't get myself to care anymore. They have done some pretty awful things to me and my sister over the last few years.

18,1daqrkw,AITA for asking my fiancé not to drink,"My fiancé (m27) and I (f23) have been together for almost a year now. At first he drank with his friends every once in a while because they are big on gaming so they would game, drink, and stay up all night. I never saw a problem with it being that I knew he was just trying to relax and hang out with the boys. A couple months gone by and we got a place together. We’ve been living together for about 5 months now and the drinking has became more of a problem. He buys whiskey during the day or if he’s getting off work at night he will go and grab beer from the gas station right up the road on the way home. He has drank every night except maybe a weeks worth ever since we started living together. I’ve never been with someone who drinks so much and I rarely drink so I don’t say anything knowing that it’s his way of relaxing. I’ve also had a bad experience in my childhood where my father was very mentally abusive to my mom because of drugs and alcohol. We’re also in a financial situation (like the rest of the world) where each month we barely make it by to pay our bills because we work in a place that pays a lot less than most places. So I had brought it up to him one night about me not liking the drinking every night. He just sat and listened to me talk and cry for about half an hour about it while he never said a word. After a moment of silence he had brushed it off like it didn’t happen and told me that our daughter needed to go to bed. We didn’t talk the rest of the night and the conversation continued to the next day when I was at work. We texted all day while I was working and when I got home barely any talking happened. He mixed up my words and tried to tell me that I thought his gaming was a problem so he tried to sell his PC (so he says). I had tried to explain to him that I was worried for us with our money, our relationship, his relationship with our daughter, and his health. He told me that he was gonna stop everything but he said it in a tone where I knew he was trying to make me the bad guy. I finally got fed up and told him to do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. About an hour later he went to play his games and I watched like nothing happened. AITA??

19,1daqfmp,AITA for not attending my friend's two weddings?,"\[edited for length\]

I (36F) have a situation with one of my bffs (45M) that I think is putting a wedge between us. My friend, let’s call him Adam, got married to Eve (38F) 1.5 years ago. They had 2 weddings (a normal one and a Chinese one) and I was invited to both. I’ve been a really close friend of Adam’s for many years. We used to live in the same city and Adam would always invite me as his “date” to galas and other events, take me to nice dinners, introduce me to really interesting people like professional athletes, artists and other people he knows. And before you ask— we never dated, while he has a heart of gold Adam isn’t my type. We did make out once or twice, but nothing serious. I moved to a city a few hours away and since then I haven’t seen Adam as often, though we still text regularly. About 3 years ago he met Eve and had a whirlwind relationship and got engaged after about a year. I haven’t met Eve but she seems nice enough, though I get the sense her travel schedule between her homes is part of why I never see Adam anymore.

Now, to the wedding. Adam used to make my birthday a REALLY big deal — we’d always go out and go to a really nice show and a high end meal, dress up etc. I guess for me it was always a bit like our friendship anniversary night. So I was surprised when I saw the first wedding was supposedly taking place on my birthday weekend. I called Adam and told him would he think about changing the date, because I was planning something with friends in my city and I couldn’t imagine him not coming. He had never been to my city before and I thought now that my live-in boyfriend and I called it quits, he could come stay the weekend, too, and see my city and life around here. It was only a “save the date,” so I figured there was still time to change it and it wasn’t even the big Chinese one. When we talked on the phone, not only did he say he couldn’t change the date, but also he refused to honor my request to not invite an ex of mine (I will not attend any event with this man there, and Adam knows this). I admit I might have gotten heated on the phone.

A few months after that, Adam texted me if I’m going to attend the Asian wedding and if I can update my RSVP one way or another since there’s a lot of people to account for. I just ignored him because I felt so disrespected from the last time we talked, and figured with all the relatives and aunties coming over from China that he wouldn’t be able to get an accurate headcount anyway. I did send him a nice entryway mat for his house off the gift registry just to try to smooth things over.

Since then, we still text pretty frequently but I feel things are “off” and I miss the connection we used to have. Adam recently visited my city for some job-related stuff and didn’t even make time to hang out. I’m beginning to wonder if maybe I was too harsh in declining to come to both his weddings and that’s hurt our friendship.

But yes. We had a problem in the past where someone in high school picked a fight with me. It was just classic bullying, she was making fun of my appearance and what I was wearing and asked if I got it from Walmart.

It was stupid, but my bf immediately jumped in and told her to mind her that I looked beautiful and she should leave me the fuck alone.

I turned to him and said I could defend myself, I didn't need him to speak up for me, and told said girl that he was right and she should leave me the fuck alone because she really wasn't looking at that amazing herself.

He said he was sorry about it later. I actually really appreciated that he stood up for me, especially because said girl use to be one of his friends, but that I would prefer that he didn't because I can defend myself.

But yeah, later I went to a party with my sister, bf, and a couple of friends.

I had a friend at the party later that made a shitty comment at me. He's a friend of my bf's and I think it just came out bad because he was drinking.

I said I had plans to go on a college trip somewhere, alone, and he said something like, ""Traveling alone? You don't get any friends, do you? I mean, it's you. Of course you don't.""

I told her that I prefer to defend myself, having my bf need to come in and defend me from a comment like that is embarassing. I said she was coming off sexist, like I need a man to defend my honor or something. Like I'm incapable of doing it myself and my bf needs to do it.

It just kinda scares me she is so so attached or sensitive beacuse i honestly dont know how she will take me becoming full on grown up.

She had never told me she's had an issue with me. She knew that I need to be told if someone wants a boundary set. If someone has an issue I want to be told upfront instead of having to do mental gymnastics to figure out what I did.

23,1dbfvmp,AITA for showing my nipple piercing to my bfs dad?,"I (f21) have been with my bf (m25) for 9 months. I spend quite a lot of time at his mum (f53) and dads (m56) as he still lives with them. I don’t like his dad. He always goes on about all the girlfriends he has when he was younger. He has made jokes about “putting me over his knee” when I swore at a football game we were watching. They have a pool and the few times I’ve used it he is always watching me out the corner of his eye. I’ve tried to tell my bf but I can never communicate just how much he annoys me or the vibes I get from him. I can hear the words I’m using and I just sound petty. 

Anyway I got my nipples pierced the other week and I was round at theirs and my bf told his dad (why I don’t know) and he said well are you going to show me then. And i just thought you know what I’m sick of this fuck it. I lifted up my top and said yeah sure. Now, I think in my head I thought this will highlight how inappropriate that request was and everyone will see what I’ve been trying to say for months. But what actually happened is that my bfs mom exploded. She called me a slut and told me to get out of her house.

I spend quite a lot of time at his mum (f53) and dads (m56) as he still lives with them. I don’t like his dad. He always goes on about all the girlfriends he has when he was younger. He has made jokes about “putting me over his knee” when I swore at a football game we were watching. They have a pool and the few times I’ve used it he is always watching me out the corner of his eye. I’ve tried to tell my bf but I can never communicate just how much he annoys me or the vibes I get from him. I can hear the words I’m using and I just sound petty. 

Anyway I got my nipples pierced the other week and I was round at theirs and my bf told his dad (why I don’t know) and he said well are you going to show me then. And i just thought you know what I’m sick of this fuck it. I lifted up my top and said yeah sure. Now, I think in my head I thought this will highlight how inappropriate that request was and everyone will see what I’ve been trying to say for months.

24,1dbfrhs,AITA - angry at a friend who broke my promise ring ,"I (19F) am in a community theatre group and have created strong bonds with lots of people there. I even reunited with an old friend from high school. (We'll call him Matt). Matt (19M) and I have been in different shows together and I considered us close friends. That being said, he would flirt with me all the time. He would make comments about my body, jokes About how he'd make ""such a better boyfriend"" than my partner of almost two years. 

I've repeatedly told Matt I'm not interested, and for a while he respected that. He was one of the people that I felt I could confide in about my relationship, friendships, etc. We'd been friends for years, and though he'd confessed he had feelings for me we are STILL both in relationships (and I declined.) I had assumed that was that.

Matt had repeatedly sent me flirtatious messages, and even some downright sexual comments either about his relationships or mine. (I showed all of these messages to my partner, yet Matt hid these messages from his girlfriend and even went as far as logging into her Snapchat to hide The receipts I had sent to her.)

But time had passed, and he had apologized — so I continued to be at least cordial with Matt. This was, until Matt and I both were at an event with our community theater, and I was having a disagreement over text with my partner. 

I was confiding in a different friend, and he inserted himself into the conversation. I don't know if his intention was to be nosy, or to help, but he figured out basically what was going on. Matt took my phone from me so I could take a breath, and I had my promise ring from my partner sitting on the table. Though my other friends were helping me, and I was trying not to make a scene, he picked up the promise ring and put it away so I ""wouldn't have to look at it.""

A lot was going on that night and I hadn't noticed that he had taken the ring away from the table. I was talking to another couple when I was about to leave that evening and Matt came up to me and said that he had snapped the ring and half and put it in the trash can to ""help me.""

It's my thought that even if it had been that serious, it was not Matt's place to take my ring, or even break it. Am I  the asshole for being angry, and even considering cutting him off because of this, or was he trying to help?

25,1dbf727,AITA for not being ready to watch my girlfriend’s 3 year old daughter on my own after 6 months together?,"The title definitely requires some context, so here goes. I (25) have been dating my girlfriend (24) for officially 6 months now. We have been off and on for close to 9 months, but those first 3 months were a bit weird and honestly worthy of a whole separate conversation, so I really don’t count until we became completely exclusive 6 months ago. She has a 3 year old daughter, and she is wonderful in every single way. A bit of a handful and fiercely independent, but still an incredible little human that I’m growing to love. The father is still in the picture, but they are obviously separated and they trade off schedules with her.

That being said, getting into this relationship as a young guy with no kids has definitely been intimidating and not without challenges. I am not naive and understand what the big picture holds should we stay together, and I truly hope we can. I know that there is a certain level of responsibility expected of me and what it means to be a constant in a young child’s life. I knew all of this going into it. It’s a unique challenge for a young woman to have to raise a daughter virtually on her own, and I know that. 

However, I am currently building my own freelance videography/photography business, and while it is beginning to go very well for me, I am still in a position where I have to work a bartending job to pay the bills and save money before I can comfortably take the leap and go full time. As you can probably imagine, this results in a pretty chaotic schedule for me where I’m working quite a bit, and my days off from bartending are invaluable to me in building my business. My girlfriend is a person who struggles being alone, and coupling that with the struggles of having a daughter can make things extra challenging as I can’t always make myself available to her as much as she would like. 

Recently, she had a work commitment on a Saturday where she needed someone to watch her daughter, and her friends heavily implied that I should do so. I needed the day to do some necessary work for my business and was basically booked for the day. I also let her know that watching her at this stage in the relationship was a bit much for me, given I have never even babysat any kid or anything like that. I even offered to take her to the zoo one on one for a couple hours one day as that seems like a better way to ease into things. But her friends seem to think I am not stepping up enough, and have made her begin to second guess if I am as well. I feel as though I have a decent argument here, but to be honest I am beginning to second guess everything myself now. AITA?

UPDATE: 
Man the number of responses has been affirming and also overwhelming. Definitely glad it seems my intuition was correct, and definitely realizing s conversation needs to be had regarding boundaries and the pace of the relationship moving forward. Going to address a few things that came up:

1.) My GF and I have known each other a lot longer than 9 months, and she really is great and an amazing mom, despite what many comments have implied. That being said, I totally understand the logic of introducing such a young child to someone. I should have mentioned, we have known each other a lot longer than 9 months and have been through quite a bit, both good and bad. So it isn’t like I haven’t been in her life for longer than 9 months.

2.) My GF and I actually met at the bartending job. She was a bartender before me and has since moved out of bartending for a day job in an office which is much better and more stable for her. 

3.) I should address income, not to boast or brag but as I feel it is relevant. Between my bartending and business I am projected to take home roughly $80-90k this year, and my business has only been running for 1.5-2 years thus far. Things are going well, but so much more needs to be done obviously. And the argument that she needs to understand I am not as “stable” as other guys might be is completely valid.

4.) I can see myself being a father one day and the thought does not scare me at all, but I just want to control the pacing of it.

5.) She understands my desire to take it slow, it is more her friend(s) being weird about it.

I definitely appreciate the responses and they have been eye opening to say the least.

My younger sister Eden lives out of state. My family mostly communicates via FB group. A few weeks ago, Eden puts on the FB group that she is bringing her family (4 total) to visit, in 2 weeks’ time. She doesn’t say this, but we all know she is short on cash and the trip will be a big expense for them.

When the message comes in, I don’t respond right away. I am working, my wife is working. If I saw it, I would have insisted right away that she stay with my family. My wife also would have invited her, she loves to host.

Unfortunately, Frank replied first to her post that he would really love it if she stayed with them as they have kids closest in age to Eden’s. Julie reinforces this asking Eden to stay with them. By the time I saw the post, Eden had already agreed to stay with them, and commented how happy she was to not have to pay for a hotel.

Here’s the thing: Julie is a pill. Eden doesn’t like her much. She is hard to deal with. Very controlling and opinionated/rude. They also don’t have as much space for Eden’s family as I do.

Like I said, I would have loved to have my sister stay with us, but I didn’t want to compete with Frank and Julie, and she had already committed to them. So I didn’t offer. My wife and I actually felt hurt she chose them so quickly!

Apparently, I was supposed to fight for my sister, because when I saw her she said she was “stuck” with Frank and Julie. Julie had given them a strict curfew, said some condescending things, and had them sleeping on couches and crappy air mattresses. Eden’s back was sore, and she was not happy with me.

I told my sister she was ALWAYS welcome at our home, and I thought I had previously made that clear (over the years). I wished she would have told me she didn’t want to stay at Frank’s house, and I would have intervened but she was so nice to them on FB and I guess I missed the queues.

She said she didn’t want to impose and I should have offered. So now I feel bad.

31,1dbdzj4,AITA for not cleaning?,"After working 5 days a week at a Summer Fun with elementary school kids from 7AM-5PM?That’s 50 hours a week, including overtime on most days.  I recently started working this job as I just graduated and don’t start college until Fall. I can admit, cleaning is the last thing on my mind at the end of the day.

My Dad has been asking me to help around the house these past few weeks. These past few weeks however I’ve been tied up in graduation as well as work and only have the weekends to “cool down”. I could try to help during the evenings that I’m home but by that time I’m dead tired.

Today I drove my Dad and I to see my grandparents. I asked if he could drive us back home because I haven’t been able to sleep and am afraid that I could doze off. “You just don’t want to do anything anymore huh?”I didn’t want to start a fight so I just tucked the keys back into my pocket and drove. I had trouble staying in the lanes and my Dad didn’t bother to try keep me “awake” as he himself decided to sleep.  Please note that I’m not licensed and I only have my permit.  I have my road test scheduled in two weeks.  I suffer from anxiety, especially after failing my first road test last month.  This combined with the stress from work and insomnia I’ve been experiencing have not been good for my mental.

Working this summer was in a way “forced on me” because my Dad doesn’t make any money.  This is a whole thing but we’ve been living off of my grandpa’s income and retirement as he is a retired military officer.  I don’t want to rub off on the kids so I try to keep them as talkative and happy as possible so that they have a good childhood.  A childhood I didn’t really get to have as my family was not as stable as others.  I am the only source of income for my Dad and I once my Grandpa’s retirement/benefits run out.  I cannot risk being “overworked”.

We were almost hit by a car on the way home.  I was not as aware as I would be if I had slept normal hours. Obviously I was shaken up and just tried to get us home as quickly as I could before I started to breakdown. My dad continued to critique my driving the whole way home which in this situation didn’t help.

In any other situation I would’ve pulled over and asked for him to drive because I couldn’t anymore but he had already declined once.  I didn’t want to deal with any more petty responses from him.  He thinks just because he could continue to drive under these circumstances, that I could too.  But I cannot, and I tried to communicate that to him once we arrived at the house but he slammed the car door on me again.  This was the fifth time today.

My Dad is becoming a person that I don’t want to be around anymore as the comfort I got from his presence is no longer there as I now fear for my safety due to his words or actions.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-08,"AITA for not cleaning? After working 5 days a week at a Summer Fun with elementary school kids from 7AM-5PM?That’s 50 hours a week, including overtime on most days.  I recently started working this job as I just graduated and don’t start college until Fall. I can admit, cleaning is the last thing on my mind at the end of the day.

My Dad has been asking me to help around the house these past few weeks. These past few weeks however I’ve been tied up in graduation as well as work and only have the weekends to “cool down”. I could try to help during the evenings that I’m home but by that time I’m dead tired.

Today I drove my Dad and I to see my grandparents. I asked if he could drive us back home because I haven’t been able to sleep and am afraid that I could doze off. “You just don’t want to do anything anymore huh?”I didn’t want to start a fight so I just tucked the keys back into my pocket and drove. I had trouble staying in the lanes and my Dad didn’t bother to try keep me “awake” as he himself decided to sleep.  Please note that I’m not licensed and I only have my permit.  I have my road test scheduled in two weeks.  I suffer from anxiety, especially after failing my first road test last month.  This combined with the stress from work and insomnia I’ve been experiencing have not been good for my mental.

Working this summer was in a way “forced on me” because my Dad doesn’t make any money.  This is a whole thing but we’ve been living off of my grandpa’s income and retirement as he is a retired military officer.  I don’t want to rub off on the kids so I try to keep them as talkative and happy as possible so that they have a good childhood.  A childhood I didn’t really get to have as my family was not as stable as others.  I am the only source of income for my Dad and I once my Grandpa’s retirement/benefits run out.  I cannot risk being “overworked”.

We were almost hit by a car on the way home.  I was not as aware as I would be if I had slept normal hours. Obviously I was shaken up and just tried to get us home as quickly as I could before I started to breakdown. My dad continued to critique my driving the whole way home which in this situation didn’t help.

In any other situation I would’ve pulled over and asked for him to drive because I couldn’t anymore but he had already declined once.  I didn’t want to deal with any more petty responses from him.  He thinks just because he could continue to drive under these circumstances, that I could too.  But I cannot, and I tried to communicate that to him once we arrived at the house but he slammed the car door on me again.  This was the fifth time today.  I’m starting to think I just need to get out of here or just help out in the evenings as much as it takes a toll on me mentally and physically.

32,1dbdu5u,AITA for talking to my sister too much?,"I am very close with my step-sister. Nothing weird or sexual we have a lot in common. We both are pilots. My sister lives nearly 2000 miles away.

My sister recently went through a rough patch in her life. She went through a bad divorce, had to move out of state for a new job that turned into a disaster, then she ended up with some family legal trouble with a real sibling who not only abused her mother but is trying to steal the family home and a dying dog to top it all off.

She also has three kids, one mentally handicapped which she believes makes it hard for her to date. She  
regularly complains about having trouble meeting men since the divorce and their fear of dating someone with difficult family obligations. So we have daily conversations and I give her a shoulder to cry on.

So enter my new girlfriend. We fell in love right away. I moved in with her about 2 months  
after we started dating. 

I did not tell my sister about us dating at first. I didn't want to rub my happiness in her face when she was single and struggling. This caused some conflict with my new girlfriend. She didn't understand why I didn't tell my sister we were dating. Eventually, I did tell my sister who was happy for me.

Right after I moved in my job got pretty intense. I was upgrading on one aircraft and learning a second all-new  
one at the same time. This required a significant amount of time in study and preparation for training.

Throughout most of my career my sister has helped prepare me for all my check rides. So we would  
spend 2 or 3 hours a day on the phone with her quizzing leading up to check rides.

I ensured that I was done studying or being a shoulder to cry on for my sister as soon as my girlfriend  
got home so I could focus on her. I made sure to give her as much attention as I could.

A few weeks after that the girlfriend started to complain about the amount of time I spent talking  
with my sister. I told her there was no way I was going to cut off my sister and that she was helping me prepare for my upcoming check rides. We regularly argued about it.

I eventually passed top of my class thanks to my sister's help. I was gone for about a month altogether  
with a week or two home in between. I made sure to call my girlfriend every day.

The night I returned home she told me she found someone else and asked me to move out. She gave me  
different reasons for ending things. But things didn't click till I told her where I planned to move. I was moving out of state. And she wanted to know how far I was moving was to where my sister lived. I would only be a few hundred miles away from my now ex-girlfriend but still over 1500 miles from my sister. She was jealous of my sister and the amount of time we talked.

So am I the asshole for spending so much time on the phone with my sister or was my now former

Ive been seriously considering our friendship, I want things work between all of us but this has been going on for so long. I used invite myself when they were going out or hinted at me wanting to go too but now I’m so tired of doing it. Its tiring to always force them to include me. I feel like they are pretending to be my friend because they’re scared to hurt my feelings but they already have a lot. I know that if me and one of them went to town the other would be mad at us but when it comes to me being upset it doesn’t seem to matter to them. Like i said before, we have had many conversations and arguments about this and they still wont do anything to be around me. I’ve thought about leaving them multiple times the past few years but never actually did it but being left out so much hurts so bad and is causing me to get in a really bad head space. I want to remove myself from them but I don’t know if I’m just being dramatic or not. Ive had friends tell me its not that big of a deal and others tell me to leave them. 

I stopped trying to text them as much because its just become a chore now too, they never respond or care to. Since I stopped trying so hard to be their friend we haven’t had a full conversation in over a week. I feel like I was the only one in the group who even cared about the friendship. They have told me a few times that they would hate it if I left the friend group but I don’t think they meant it based on how they’re acting now that I’m giving up. I told them i was done trying but i think they took it a different way and that it wasn’t serious.

its still got my head in a loop and i spoke to my father about it and he said they already discussed it and that she wasnt necessarily wrong but when i spoke to a few other women around her age about it they told me it wasn't appropriate. I  was 18 at the time and I was starting to go out with a friend and i had just broke up with my highschool boyfriend and hooked up with some dude who ended up ghosting me a few days later after he got what he wanted Sex ended up happening but it was natural and from the way he made it seem he was serious about me. She had a discussion with me and spoke about my whereabouts and sex life and she told me how many people she had sex with and how she would have sex with anyone that sounded good to her. she had her first child when she was 17 and she didn't realize that she needed to slow down until her third child. she also told me she almost got an std i understand that she meant well but i also dont understand why she went into depth and detail and also barging into my life asking about my whereabouts and how many people i have slept with and who i have slept with
i certainly believe that it was inappropriate and that she could have worded it better.
Whats bothering so much about this conversation is moreso about her sex life mixing with my sex life.

I(19F), had a coworker we’ll call Lisa. Lisa worked part time and was in her 40s. We work in a hospital kitchen that specializes in long term care. Lisa was a single mom of three going through a divorce. She was a very nice person, but she also tended to overshare a lot, which is why I know as much as I do. Her son actually was a patient in our hospital for a while when he was younger, he’s about 5 now.
Now, Lisa was a terrible coworker. She would constantly beg for more hours and then she would no call/no show for sometimes multiple shifts a week. She also would be late a lot because her son needed a babysitter and something was always going wrong. Basically, I know she was trying, but that made things very hard on the rest of us. 
Anyway, now to yesterday. Lisa told my boss, we’ll call her Carol, that she needed to make a phone call to her lawyer while on her break, and she might go over time. Carol said it was fine, but after she had been 20 minutes over, my she texted Lisa to ask when she’d be back.
Now, Carol has a little office in the side of the kitchen where she does computer work like ordering food, etc. I was in there talking to her about a patient’s diet when Lisa comes storming in and started yelling at my boss for the text. It went something like,
L: “I told you I’d be over! I’m dealing with my ex trying to take my kids from me!”
C: “I understand, and I’m sorry. I just needed to know how long you would be.”
They argued back and forth until Lisa took off her apron and threw it on the ground before she stormed off. She didn’t throw it at my boss, but I thought she was going to for a second, and so did my boss. That’s when I left the office and tried to get back to work. My colleague (16) asked me what happened but I just told her it wasn’t any of my business.
About ten minutes later, I saw my 16-year old coworker comforting a crying Lisa, and I genuinely felt very bad for her.
Well, despite everything Carol was willing to work with Lisa on everything, and told her that she was fine if Lisa needed some more time off. She also told her that she would have to write up Lisa for throwing her apron, however, but it was a first strike, so it shouldn’t have been a big deal.
Lisa argued that and said she already apologized, which she did, and that she shouldn’t get a write up. Carol told her that it was caught on camera and her bosses had already reached out to her after another coworker told a higher up.
Long story short, Lisa walked out after she was told she would be getting a write up. Now, at my job, if you walk out of a shift that is seen as you quitting.
Fast forward to today, I get a text from Lisa asking me to vouch for her to get her job back because I saw her throw the apron. I told her I would tell them what I saw if they asked.

About ten minutes later, I saw my 16-year old coworker comforting a crying Lisa, and I genuinely felt very bad for her.
Well, despite everything Carol was willing to work with Lisa on everything, and told her that she was fine if Lisa needed some more time off. She also told her that she would have to write up Lisa for throwing her apron, however, but it was a first strike, so it shouldn’t have been a big deal.
Lisa argued that and said she already apologized, which she did, and that she shouldn’t get a write up. Carol told her that it was caught on camera and her bosses had already reached out to her after another coworker told a higher up.
Long story short, Lisa walked out after she was told she would be getting a write up. Now, at my job, if you walk out of a shift that is seen as you quitting.
Fast forward to today, I get a text from Lisa asking me to vouch for her to get her job back because I saw her throw the apron. I told her I would tell them what I saw if they asked. I haven’t heard back from her.",0.0,-0.001147218281403184,0,1

40,1dbcv6r,AITA if I make a complaint?,"Okay, so: We've got very loud & inconsiderate/oblivious neighbors. 

They've got loud, vicious dogs who try to attack ours through our backyard fence, to the point where we hate having to let our dogs out to simply use the bathroom because all they do is bark & snap at each other through the fence. We've already covered the fence in thick tarp/like material, so they can't see each other to trigger a response, but the neighboring dogs chewed a hole in it🙂 Blocked off the hole with a storage container lid, they've shimmied it off the hole🫠 We go out yelling at our dogs constantly, trying to deter them from the fence & corral them back into the house, meanwhile the neighbors just let their dogs be aggressive. Their portion of the fence also hasn't been upkept at all since they moved in, as its the same fence from at least 3 different sets of residents & like 20+ years of wear & tear, so who knows what might happen, should it break or deteriorate any further, its just crappy wire fencing.

Another thing: They've got even louder kids. Out at all hours, just screaming in their backyard, and I DO MEAN all hours. I got home from work at 11pm on a weeknight the other day(school was still in session, today is actually the first day of summer break), its pitch-dark out, they're still outside jumping on a trampoline & screaming. And I'm not talking about play that involves screaming occasionally, its literally ""I'm just out here to scream, because I can"". Last year, they had a pool up, & the kids would be in it swimming around screaming past midnight. Every other house that surrounds them are elderly residents, I'm surprised none of them have made complaints yet. Its one thing to have the occasional loud get-together, but its literally all day, every day. And I swear, the kids don't age. Its been a gaggle of elementary schoolers since I was still in school, nearly 10 years ago.

I'm sure that if I don't want to hear the trills from the movie Coco when I get up at 2am to pee, because they have all their doors & windows open & the TV (for literally no reason) at max volume), that none of the other neighbors do, either.

We don't do anything in our backyard anymore because all their loud barking & screaming 24/7 makes us miserable. Nobody wants to sit on their patio swing, going ""ah, such a nice day!☺️"" as like seven gremlins are screaming in the next yard over.

John has been out of town and I haven’t been able to visit and get it. He ended up coming back like a day or two early and I was waiting for him outside of his house so I could just grab it real quick.

John let me in and told me to wait by the front door because it was in his bedroom. He walked past like the living room area and said “oh shit” and laughed, when I asked what, he said nothing. While he was in his bedroom I went to look in the living room.

My other friend Connor (23M) was asleep on the couch in only his boxers, and his girlfriend Lily (23F) who is John’s best friend and roommate was on top of him face down in only her underwear. It wasn’t like full nudity, a little bit of side boob and then Lily’s butt cheeks with underwear, but that’s about it. I took a picture and posted it to Snapchat.

No one really said anything to me about it, I didn’t even get a lot of story replies. Something important to mention: Connor and Lily post videos of themselves having sex for extra money, so I don’t see how a picture with no nudity of them sleeping and being sweet together is really a big problem.

43,1dbbv98,AITA for not inviting certain family members to our destination wedding,"Just received a lengthy text from an aunt saying she & her husband will no longer be attending our wedding after learning that we did not invite their 2 children (my cousins, both adults, over 35yo) with whom I nor my fiancée do not have any particular relationships with or speak to on a regular basis outside of bday or holiday greetings. Nothing personal, we just have never been that close. By inviting my cousin, we would have also had to include one of their husbands & 2 children. Each guest is about $150 per plate keep in mind. 

In the text my aunt expressed feeling “sad” & “disappointed” at the discovery of my cousins not being invited, as they had hoped to make a family vacation out of the trip. Also adding that she “needs to LOWER her expectations from other people”. With the word “lower” in ALL CAPS. She ended the text with “you won’t hear from me for a long while but pls respect the process”. 

Mind you, we had chosen my aunt & uncle to be wedding sponsors months ago (which they accepted), not seeking financial support for the wedding whatsoever, but rather to personally express my gratitude to them for their love & support throughout the years. So I am a bit taken back by her response to all this. 

With that said, AITA? Is my aunt overreacting or should I have just invited my cousins? I know my focus should be on my fiancée & the wedding, but I can’t help but feel bad & worry that this may now cause some of divide in the family.

44,1dbbs06,AITA for calling out someone being sad over a refrigerator?  ....a refrigerator ,"OK, so it's my mother.  She had a fridge for 10+ yrs...I fixed it 5 yrs ago after a power outage surge.  Then it broke down again 3 yrs ago. I couldn't fix it and everyone told me this brand isn't worth fixing cuz it's an LG and it's a pain in the ass and exoeto get fixed. So it's sat there, 
meanwhile while parents used a shitty fridge in the garage that's annoying to have to get to. 

When I visit it's a pain in the ass to cook for them and have to go back n forth.  So recently I found a bargain on a $3500 fridge on clearance for $700 for them.  

She was like, OK, I'll give u the money but I declined.  She mentions how it's a good fridge and could be fixed. I mention I can cancel it and she says no, it's OK, but ""I KNOW it can be fixed."" She seemed fine-ish with it. Whatever.  I told her they'd haul off the old one but I could cancel that, but she said no in case it messes up the order and they cancel the order or something weird.  

So yesterday, it's installed and I go get her, and she has her typical dogface and sad face, kinda like upset at me, but not saying anything.  Then goes to the fridge with that mad and sad face and says, I'm so sad about the other fridge. Has a stern look and walks away to her room.

I'm like, you're acting like this over a refrigerator? Are u kidding me? 

Instead of once saying thanks for taking care of it all, and being happy she has a working and brand new top of the line fridge, she has this look of disgust-ish, mad-ish, sad look, and it's obviously at me...because of an nonworkong fkng fridge that hasn't worked for years. 

Am I the asshole for being upset at her and calling her out over this?

45,1dbblwe,AITA for not going home to help my parents?,"Hi Reddit! 

First time poster!

Basically I (31F) live with my parents (69M and 65F) to both take care of them and their business. Due to various health reasons they both can’t drive, or do any paperwork related to the business so it tends to fall on me and my sister (33F). 

A few months ago I had to quit my job in order to care for them without feeling myself go insane due to scheduling conflicts with the business which would sometimes interfere with work or sleeping after shifts (I worked a job that had me do 3 12 hour shifts a week). Now I basically just care for them and am on  call for whatever they need.

So I went to visit my sister in a city about 2.5 hours away by train for a few days (planning to stay 6/5-6/10) when my mom calls on 6/7 to basically tell me that I need to return home tomorrow (6/8) because my Dad has a meeting on the 9th and I need to write a check (neither are capable of writing a check) because it’s late.

I know the people we need to write the check to and honestly they never minded it being given to them in the middle of the month so long as it was explained, but I don’t know if they really are impatient for it or not: only that they previously were okay with it. As for the meeting I offered to call them an Uber so they can still attend.

My sister wound up calling her and telling her I wasn’t going back until Monday which was what was originally planned anyway and she called me selfish. I could easily go back as the trains are frequent and not too expensive between here and my parents. So now I’m not sure if I am or not. So I thought I’d post it here to see AITA?

My mom told me many times before to clean their room but I refuse and have discussed with her repeatedly they’re old enough to make their own beds, especially my 17 year old brother.

Because I refuse and have set a boundary with my mom for this “chore”, my sister tends to do their beds and clean their room not because she wants to, but because she doesn’t want my mom to get angry. Both of my parents have anger issues and always yell which is something for another time.

Anyways, today, my sister chose not to and so my mom asked me to make their beds.

She left me alone, but after lunch in the afternoon, she made me go to my brothers’ room, so I only made my 13 year old brother’s bed and left.

47,1dbbf3i,AITA for lashing out at my roomate after saying i wanted to be alone?,"I (20F) came home from the bar last night pretty late. I didn’t think this would be a problem with my roommate because she (25F) has come back to our hotel room every night for the last three weeks past 2am and always wakes me up.

This was my first time going out with my friends this trip, since i’ve been focused on studying. So I had no clue alcohol would affect me differently than back home. Well as I was getting a shower that’s when the alcohol hit me hard and I started having an anxiety attack. (i’ve never had an anxiety attack while drinking, but have had anxiety issues during this trip. Since i’m in a different country for over a month and having bad homesickness) 

During this trip when I start having anxiety episodes due to being homesick, or once for a brief miscommunication with my roomie where she had lashed out at me. Ive shut myself in the bathroom and sat on the floor crying naked and have tried to be as quiet as i can. 

I’ve made it known to her several times I don’t like being around anyone when im anxious and crying. Alas every time ive shut myself in the bathroom to cry naked (i get overheated while crying and that makes it worse)she’s come in to check on me even though i’ve asked her not to. One time she genuinely helped because I was crying over an incident between us and she explained I was perceiving it wrong. However the other times ive just felt extremely violated (combo of nakedness and feeling pathetic). 

But last night I apparently lashed out at her and I don’t remember it. (probably a result of the alcohol hitting me and maybe a bit of a trauma response from feeling violated yet again… I always remember everything that happens when I drink because im careful not to drink too much. And ive never had an anxiety attack while drinking since a few drinks always just makes me wanna dance and have a good time). 

This morning I tried apologizing for crying since I remember her coming into the bathroom. She responded by saying she wasnt angry about being woken up but angry about what I said and did. But firmly said she didn’t want to talk about it but to give her space.  I have no recollection of the conversation or what I apparently did, but can’t stop questioning if me lashing out was valid since she’s crossed my boundaries so many times.  

I haven’t had anxiety attacks very often this trip only 4 occasions on a 6 week trip i’d say anyone who’s has homesickness is allowed to cry and be given the space when it is asked for. Also, crying 4 times during an over month long span isn’t too bad of a record. This is the only time i’ve never recalled doing something while drunk. And I only don’t remember that conversation.

I don’t think I drank too much, but that it was a response to being walked in on naked while having an anxiety attack.

I (20F) came home from the bar last night pretty late. I didn’t think this would be a problem with my roommate because she (25F) has come back to our hotel room every night for the last three weeks past 2am and always wakes me up.

This was my first time going out with my friends this trip, since i’ve been focused on studying. So I had no clue alcohol would affect me differently than back home. Well as I was getting a shower that’s when the alcohol hit me hard and I started having an anxiety attack. (i’ve never had an anxiety attack while drinking, but have had anxiety issues during this trip. Since i’m in a different country for over a month and having bad homesickness) 

During this trip when I start having anxiety episodes due to being homesick, or once for a brief miscommunication with my roomie where she had lashed out at me. Ive shut myself in the bathroom and sat on the floor crying naked and have tried to be as quiet as i can. 

I’ve made it known to her several times I don’t like being around anyone when im anxious and crying. Alas every time ive shut myself in the bathroom to cry naked (i get overheated while crying and that makes it worse)she’s come in to check on me even though i’ve asked her not to. One time she genuinely helped because I was crying over an incident between us and she explained I was perceiving it wrong. However the other times ive just felt extremely violated (combo of nakedness and feeling pathetic). 

But last night I apparently lashed out at her and I don’t remember it. (probably a result of the alcohol hitting me and maybe a bit of a trauma response from feeling violated yet again… I always remember everything that happens when I drink because im careful not to drink too much. And ive never had an anxiety attack while drinking since a few drinks always just makes me wanna dance and have a good time). 

This morning I tried apologizing for crying since I remember her coming into the bathroom. She responded by saying she wasnt angry about being woken up but angry about what I said and did. But firmly said she didn’t want to talk about it but to give her space.  I have no recollection of the conversation or what I apparently did, but can’t stop questioning if me lashing out was valid since she’s crossed my boundaries so many times.  

I haven’t had anxiety attacks very often this trip only 4 occasions on a 6 week trip i’d say anyone who’s has homesickness is allowed to cry and be given the space when it is asked for. Also, crying 4 times during an over month long span isn’t too bad of a record. This is the only time i’ve never recalled doing something while drunk. And I only don’t remember that conversation. I even remember sitting outside right after the fact to calm myself down and call my boyfriend.  So I didn’t “black out” or anything like that.

Some background context, I've been seeing a very friendly cat hanging around my street for the past couple of months. While very friendly, I began to fear the cat was lost or abandoned. The cat had a collar but no tag, and spent most days and nights visiting my house and my neighbors, meowing for either for food or to be let inside. My neighbors didn't know who's cat it was. And I could have sworn the cat was getting skinnier compared to when I first saw it. Eventually I made a reddit post asking anyone in my neighborhood if it was their cat. Long story short, I got into contact with the supposed owner(Person A), who I told the location of the cat. They eventually come and pick it up.

A few days later, I get contacted by apparently the real owner(Person B) of the cat who saw my reddit post. The details they knew about the cat indicated they were the true owner. I gave them all the info I had about Person A. Person B is now on their way to get their cat back. Everything I know about the Person A indicated they genuinely thought the cat was theirs, rather than this being an intentional kidnapping.

They live around 900 miles from me and have been talking about getting married.

I was hurt by that, but things were worked out. At first they were going to have a quick marriage in front of a justice of the peace and then have a ceremony a year later so family and friends could attend. I was ok with this.

I asked my daughter what is the rush. Nothing really in her life will change. She is keeping her last name. They already live together.

53,1dba2u0,AITA for calling out my sister’s behaviour ,"I’m 17F and my sister is 14F. Growing up i had always felt my parents favoured her however pushed it to the side, over the past few years her personality has changed a lot. She is incredibly rude and rarely comes out of her room, she lacks manners and when our parents try to start a conversation with her she either ignores them or grunts at the floor.

At first, my parents put it down to age however this has been going on for two years now and she is becoming ruder. My father makes excuses for all her behaviour when its brought into conversation as he believes she is struggling through depression, however even other family members have asked me about why she is so rude.

My father has bipolar and struggles with depression, he is a narcissist and myself and my mother feel as though he is pushing his own struggles onto my sister to try and “fix” her. Both of them go above and beyond to try and get her to like them ie buying her whatever she asks for and ignoring her behaviour. However when i recently asked for a textbook was told that I was spoiled. 

I cant help but compare their treatment of her with how they treated me when i acted a similar way. They came down so hard on me for misbehavings to the point where I was grounded for weeks and our fights were so bad that I stayed round friends and have on more than one occasion felt threatened by my parents. 

Both had their own priorities while I was growing up, which often left me to look after both myself and my sister for long periods of time, which I have never been thanked for by any of the parties involved. Due to this recently I have been calling out my sister and parents on their treatment and have been told that i am just jelous and often they come down harder on me than my sister for her rudeness.

I understand she may be struggling (although it is very unlikely) and again cant help but compare to when I personally had problems with mental health and was ignored. My parents have said on repeated opinions that i bully my sister, but in realuty all i do is acknoledge that she hasn’t said thank you or object from doing her chores ect an example of this being ,after recieveing my GCSE results last year, my parents were disappointed that my results were not straight ‘9s’ as had been predicted ( I got a 7 in maths) and when i pointed out my sister gets straight Ds and they praise her, was told i was mean and horrible.

Long story short, my husband has had a lot of abandonment issues and hasn't had successful relationships and viewed our relationship as his last shot at love. He also was never great with managing money, spending a lot of it on video games. He is always the type to put himself down when things don't go his way and I have always tried being his voice of reason but it seemed like all my efforts to show him that he's not worthless or pathetic have been in vain because he will always resort back to that and will always bring up that he has been pressured by his family to do things he didn't want to do. I always tried encouraging him to stand on his own two feet, to try different things but he never has wanted to, never wanted to try and meet new people but has always spoke about not having any friends, always talked about not being included into things when I would invite him out to places he stated he didn't want to go so I stopped trying. I was the only one who worked and he couldn't work because he is on disability but he could've had tried a side hustle or under the table work. We have had fights about his irresponsible use of money and expecting me to pay all of his bills. Prime example is he decided he wanted a brand new car rather than just paying for one with the cash he did have at the time for a used car and his response to me would be ""Why should I get to drive a nice car and he has to drive a piece of shit?"".

AITA?",TL;DR,2024-06-08,"AITA for no longer helping my ex pay his bills I have been married to my husband for almost 4 years now and we share no children together but have brought outside children into our relationship. Long story short, my husband has had a lot of abandonment issues and hasn't had successful relationships and viewed our relationship as his last shot at love. He also was never great with managing money, spending a lot of it on video games. He is always the type to put himself down when things don't go his way and I have always tried being his voice of reason but it seemed like all my efforts to show him that he's not worthless or pathetic have been in vain because he will always resort back to that and will always bring up that he has been pressured by his family to do things he didn't want to do. I always tried encouraging him to stand on his own two feet, to try different things but he never has wanted to, never wanted to try and meet new people but has always spoke about not having any friends, always talked about not being included into things when I would invite him out to places he stated he didn't want to go so I stopped trying.

57,1db98bp,AITA for telling my SIL that kids like hers are the reason I’m childfree (because they stole my keepsakes) ,"I can’t decide if I should feel guilty about this or just be angry. Tending toward angry right now but I need a reality check, especially because I’m not a parent. My husband and I are in our late 30s. My family doesn’t care about me being childfree, but my husband’s family has asked pointedly about “time running out” a few times. My husband is a really sweet man who actually loves kids, and even I find them endearing most of the time. But we don’t think parenting is worth it for us. We have cats. 

My SIL has 2 kids, they’re 7 and 9. They are staying with us for a week because they wanted to visit our city for vacation. We have a bookcase of keepsakes in the living room. We have flowers from our wedding in resin, I have my granddad’s coin collection, we have trinkets from trips we’ve been on, and other things like theirs. 2 shelves worth of stuff. None of it is worth any money, just very sentimental. 

Well today I noticed 2 things missing - our wedding flower and a bracelet from my middle school friend. Obviously I kind of freaked out and I asked my SIL if she had any idea. Her kids were also there and they looked a little odd so I asked them if they knew anything. They said no but they looked upset. SIL got mad and said I can’t accuse her kids of anything. I insisted on looking in their room and I found the things. I asked the kids why they took them and they said they looked cool. I was really mad but my SIL told them to go down. She told me not to make such a big deal and the kids were scared. I said kids like this are why we’re childfree. She said I crossed a line. I think the kids heard too because they were probably hanging around upstairs and trying to listen in. But I truly didn’t mean for them to hear. 

My husband says I’m right but since we got the stuff back I could have let it go. And not drag him into it.

58,1db9771,AITA? Car dial vs button,"My husband's mother was talking about having had a hard time with the shifter in my husband's car. When we drove away, I asked if you could ""feel"" it shift, because I'm sensory specific.. he said yes.

I started talking about how I wish more cars still had dials and shifters, for people who prefer tactile tools.. I don't like having to look at and touch digital screens... I started talking about preferring the feel of duals... he cuts me off and messes with the button, saying it's the same thing... 

I say ""not to me"", and start explaining how I run my hands on the panel and ""feel"", and again, he cuts me off about how it's super simple, the button just goes up and down, it's the same thing... again, I say not to me..  I move on, because he clearly isn't getting it, and I talk about feeling the shifter and don't like the dial for the P,D, R, N.. ilike to feel it click into the right spot.. he starts going on again about how it's the same thing... I say not to me... he argues with me saying it is.. I say that while it's function might be the same, it's absolutely not the same thing... he keeps going.. so I turn away  and tell him I'm not discussing this anymore, because he's not hearing me.

He DOUBLES DOWN on how it's the same thing and all cars are like that... so I get annoyed and tell him that I didn't ask for his opini9n, and to just stop. He keeps going.. so I eventually yell at him about how I don't want his opinion and to just stop. He gets all sarcastic about oh I guess he's nit allowed to share gis opinion.. I tell him he is, but that's not what he's done.. that what he's done is cut me off, dismissed that i feel differently about it, made it out to be like I need to suck it up because his preference is better   and then double downed on trying to show me how identical buttons and dials are.. I didn't even really get to get my initial thoughts out, and every time I tried, he'd just cut me off and do it again.

Now I'm upset  because I've tried to explain this many times, and he's still acting like a child making sarcastic comments and being passive aggressive, trying to say that I'm crazy and that I'm the one who lost my shit screaming at him when all he did was tell me his opinion.. except his opinion was he feels button's and dials are the same.. noted.. they're still nit the same TO ME and he wouldn't let me get that our without jumping in to convince me they were identical.

AITA for getting upset about this interaction and having broken down what he did to make me upset, or is he TA for ignoring what I said about any of it and focusing instead on the fact I yelled? (Hr did too, btw.)

59,1db8ys0,AITA for making my ‘nephew’ eat food he ruined?,"He (11M) is the child of my friend, I refer to him as my nephew because he calls me Auntie. 

He was at my house and I made some houmous (also known as hummus.) He asked if he could put some Worcestershire sauce on his; I asked if that’s something he’s had on it before, he replied no, I offered to give him a small portion to try it first, he insisted he likes it and wants it. I told him that in that case, even if he didn’t like it, I expected him to eat it all. 

Surprise, Worcestershire sauce and houmous is not a winning combination. He wanted to leave it and have me make him something else, I reminded him that I expected him to eat it after he was so insistent on having it. I conceded I couldn’t force him to eat it but I wouldn’t be making something else. 

I’m now the most horrible aunt ever and my friend is angry that I let her son ‘starve’ (this was lunchtime, she was picking him up at 5.30pm to return home, he wasn’t going to waste away.) I don’t honestly think I’m wrong here but maybe I am?

Edit: I’m advised to add the following that I replied to a question - there was also bread and celery and carrot and cucumber sticks, and feta cubes. He did eat the bread and feta cubes so there wasn’t no food, just not as much as originally intended.

Second Edit: First, addressing a few common topics:

- that’s a pretty normal sized lunch in my country, it’s more food than I’d generally eat for lunch, and it’s a similar size to the lunches his mother feeds him;

- I call it houmous because the standard spelling in my country - it’s an accepted variation, people! 😂

Thank you for overall voting me NTA, although I suspect it was close and I have read all the comments and taken them on board. As a few people guessed, my friend got the “I ate nothing all day” version from my nephew, and once she heard the extended version of events she was no longer particularly upset. I agree I could have been as insistent that he try a small bit as I was that I wasn’t replacing it if he didn’t like it, and apologised to him for that; I also apologised for the ‘you will finish it’ - that was never what I meant. He now understands why it was suggested that he experiments with a small bit, and accepts he could and should have taken that advice. He also apologised for wasting it, although whilst I don’t like food waste that wasn’t my main concern. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-08,"AITA for making my ‘nephew’ eat food he ruined?

One day my BIL calls me after 5 years that my husband wanted to come pick my kids for a visit so I agreed. I would call once a day because I wasn’t used to being away from them. Every time I called they were in a car. But I figured he hasn’t seen them in 5 years they was probably bonding little did I know that wasn’t the case. Guess that a fight broke out at MIL house over my kids who aren’t bad and her boyfriend wanted them gone. So she kicked my kids and husband out and they was living in his car for a month. Even tho they both have their own room living with me. I wasn’t made aware of this until they came back and my husband wouldn’t leave because he had no where to go. Now it’s been 3 years and my husband forgave her but I haven’t he wants to go for a visit but I won’t go nor do I want my kids to AITA?  Edit at the time I was told that they would be staying with him at his moms house that’s where he was living and every time I called the kids had been asked not to inform me of the situation. Also when he didn’t leave I asked him to go to marriage counseling and church with me and ever since we have been although it does hurt that he left my kids are happy the family is back together and now it’s been better. But now that I’ve seen the post about trauma bonding I’ve looked into I hate to think I was In the wrong and all this is In someway my fault. Always thought I was doing the right thing by protecting my kids and wanting them to have a relationship with their dad even if half of it was me doing it for him.",0.0,1.0042002201080322,1,0
65,1db72pr,AITA for not calling my brother finance’s his spouse or step-mom to his child. ,"Throwaway account so ages and names are not included. 

My brother has dated his now fiancé for over 10 years. They got engaged about 3 years. There is no wedding date set and when people ask, they say they are in no rush to marry. 

Since they are not married, my family calls her his fiancé. She wants to be considered his spouse. I have other siblings who are married and she considers herself the same SIL or BIL. 

My brother also has a child from a previous relationship. We know my brother’s finance loves his daughter but we don’t call her my niece’s step-mom. My niece had a baby and we don’t call her grandma either. 

The fiancé says this hurts her feelings but my whole family disagrees with her wanting these titles. She says her family calls my brother her spouse, so we should too. Even though my family isn’t old-fashioned, we figured they haven’t gotten married for a reason, and if they aren’t in a rush to marry, why would we use the married terms for her. 

Additionally, we would do this if any of my other siblings were in this situation. It had nothing to do with her personally. 

So, Am I (and the rest of my family) an Asshole for not taking her feelings into account? 



Edit: I did forget to add that since they started dating, she wanted to be considered an aunt and other familial terms before anyone thought that way of her. So there has always been an issue with her wanting to impose terms before the feelings are there. When that has been brought up to her, she only wants us to consider her feelings and no one else.

66,1db70sn,AITA for expecting my flatmate friend to have my back when asked on a date by my crush?,"I(F25) live with Gia(F27) & Tony(M26) since 3y. We are close friends, supporting each other during dating crises, family issues & health scares. I met my friend Dustin(M25) **a year ago**. We had a great time together and he was the first person I liked in a long time after my ex. I talked about him at home. 

**3 months ago**, I had a medical emergency. After this, Dustin came to my place almost every day to cheer me up during my recovery. My flatmates and I discussed daily whether Dustin was romantically interested in me. Gia was supportive but often told me what I wanted to hear, while Tony based his opinion on what he saw. Both convinced me he was into me and were happy he seemed to care about me.

**Several weeks later** I discover that Dustin had a date with a friend of Gia's, whom he met at a party I hosted. Gia knew and didn't tell me. I was upset with her as this info was crucial for managing my expectations. I told Dustin my flatmates were shipping us and I was open to exploring a romantic connection. He admitted he was aware I liked him but only enjoyed spending time with me as a friend. He talked about his insecurity and tendency to say yes to everything. This lowered my opinion of him, but at least I knew. We stayed friends but saw less of each other. I was getting over the crush.

**A month after** Dustin sees me on a dating app (I told him I swiped him right but didn't), then bumps into Gia and asks her out! Gia said yes, got his number & later asked me about my feelings before texting him. She said she didn't want drama & was informing me but didn't deny being interested & was asking ""permission"" to date him.

She put me in a shitty position,making me seem controlling/jealous when I am just hurt she prioritized a date over our three-year friendship. If I were her, I would have laughed it off, indicating it was inappropriate for him to ask me out.

Gia hates confrontation and never says no, often goes out with taken/poly men. While Tony & I try to advise her on her private life, her lack of judgment now affects mine. 

AITA for expecting her to prioritize our friendship over this problematic guy and decline his date invite immediately? She has to see the consequences of her actions. I will be just a polite flatmate to Gia, no longer confiding in her. 

For Gia I am an A-hole for being so dramatic when she did not even go out with my crush. For me her instinctive first response showed what she wanted & said enough about the type of friend she is.

Anyways, yesterday this relative comes to me and asks what are my birthday plans, to which I told her I don’t want to celebrate cos I miss my family, then I told her I’ll order some food and me and the kids can party a bit. To which she says…’uh will it be okay if we celebrate your birthday after 1 day? Because I want to go to my moms house’ I was like urm sure. 

But then later I thought that how weird of her to take her kids and entire family to her moms house on the day of my birthday?

69,1db68tb,AITA for going for lunch with colleagues?,"I have worked in my current job for around 16 months. I have the option of working from home as often as I would like with the exceptions of in person full team meetings etc. My old team were not really social and all hated coming into the office.

Due to this I only tended to go in around once every 2 months. I started with another member of staff, lets call her Chloe, who also rarely went into the office due to her team not going in.

A couple of months ago, both myself and Chloe changed teams and were put into the same team. This team is a lot more social. They like going into the office either individually or as a team and enjoy going for lunch and planning social activities. I like this as I like being in the office and working from home was starting to feel very isolating.

I now go into the office once or twice a week. Not everyone from the team are there when I go in but whenever people from the team are there we will sit together, grab lunch etc.

My new team has 8 people, 5 of these are women and 3 are men. There have been times where I'll go into the office and there's only 1 member of the team there and we'll go to lunch. This could be any team member, I don't really know who is going to be in until I get there. My partner has started having a problem with me going into the office as regularly as I am and going for lunch with co-workers.

Chloe and I tend to be the people who are in the office the most as it's nice for us to have a more sociable team now and not be stuck at home so there have been a few times when it is just Chloe and I going for lunch but we'll still invite anyone else who is in the office and isn't in our team but they tend to decline.

She said it's weird going for lunch 1 on 1 with another woman but I just pointed out they were my colleagues and it's not like it's ever planned to just be 2 of us in, it just depends on the rest of the team.

I pointed out I've been to lunch one 1 on 1 with male members of my team and other female members of the team who aren't Chloe so it's not like it's always just us.

My gf has said she thinks if it's only going to be 1 member of the team in the office that I shouldn't go in or at least go to lunch with them. I told her there shouldn't be a problem with me making friends at work but she just said its disrespectful that I'm not listening to her and considering not going to lunch 1 on 1 with another woman.

71,1db662q,WIBTA if I don’t pick up my sister from school anymore?,"I (20f) am the oldest of three. My younger sister (13f) and my little brother (9m). I still live with my parents because they have offered to pay for my uni. Therefore I like/try to help them out around our place. Doing the dishes, cleaning, sometimes even cooking lunch or dinner. My parents (40f) (45m) both work full time, and my pops even works a separate part time to provide for us, and save up money for emergencies. 

One of the big things I’ve helped my mum out specifically is dropping off my sister, and picking up both kids after their classes. When I was around my sisters age unfortunately no one was able to help my parents in picking me up from classes as much therefore I had to take the bus. Which is why I decided to learn how to drive as soon as I could. Back to the issue. 

My sister being barely a teen, kind of has developed attitude problems. She’s a great kid and she has good grades, but she’s been very lippy towards my parents at every inconvenience. If me or mum make dinner and she doesn’t like she she claims she’ll starve or claims we hate her as we don’t want to see her eat. Mind you we always ask everyone what they would want for dinner and are met with “idk whatever you make” from her. We don’t let her starve we end up making something else for her. If she wants to hang out with her friends on a certain day, she always makes me take her. Not beg, not ask in advance. She throws my car keys at me and goes “take me to so and so’s house”

Sometimes I take my siblings to get food after their classes and she’s always making me go to two separate places. My brother is just a boy that likes nuggets and fries. But my sister is a “cravings” girlie and sometimes she makes me drive far. Recently I lost it on both my brother and sister (he isn’t exactly a walk in the park either) about this. My sister then goes “you think your so sweet taking care of your siblings, but we don’t care! We don’t care if you do or don’t. You put that pressure onto yourself.” I drove the rest of the way in silence. 

I talked to my mum about this and she talked with my sister. I know it was a tough talk, I heard a lot of yelling from her room. The next day, my sister just asks if I’m going to take her or not. She didn’t apologize. I was exhausted to argue so I simply did it. I’m so sick of being unappreciated, I feel used in a way. I then think of the sacrifices my parents make and I instantly feel guilty. I don’t know what to do. My sister refuses to ride in a bus btw. She claims they are dirty. I don’t know how to tell my mum that I don’t want to pick up my sister from school anymore. I feel like such an hole for not helping out, but my sisters behavior makes it so hard to just keep doing it.

When I was around my sisters age unfortunately no one was able to help my parents in picking me up from classes as much therefore I had to take the bus. Which is why I decided to learn how to drive as soon as I could. Back to the issue. 

My sister being barely a teen, kind of has developed attitude problems. She’s a great kid and she has good grades, but she’s been very lippy towards my parents at every inconvenience. If me or mum make dinner and she doesn’t like she she claims she’ll starve or claims we hate her as we don’t want to see her eat. Mind you we always ask everyone what they would want for dinner and are met with “idk whatever you make” from her. We don’t let her starve we end up making something else for her. If she wants to hang out with her friends on a certain day, she always makes me take her. Not beg, not ask in advance. She throws my car keys at me and goes “take me to so and so’s house”

Sometimes I take my siblings to get food after their classes and she’s always making me go to two separate places. My brother is just a boy that likes nuggets and fries. But my sister is a “cravings” girlie and sometimes she makes me drive far. Recently I lost it on both my brother and sister (he isn’t exactly a walk in the park either) about this. My sister then goes “you think your so sweet taking care of your siblings, but we don’t care! We don’t care if you do or don’t. You put that pressure onto yourself.” I drove the rest of the way in silence. 

I talked to my mum about this and she talked with my sister. I know it was a tough talk, I heard a lot of yelling from her room. The next day, my sister just asks if I’m going to take her or not. She didn’t apologize. I was exhausted to argue so I simply did it. I’m so sick of being unappreciated, I feel used in a way. I then think of the sacrifices my parents make and I instantly feel guilty. I don’t know what to do. My sister refuses to ride in a bus btw. She claims they are dirty. I don’t know how to tell my mum that I don’t want to pick up my sister from school anymore. I feel like such an hole for not helping out, but my sisters behavior makes it so hard to just keep doing it. 

So WIBTA if i stopped picking up my sister from school?",0.0,0.013788705691695213,0,1

My mom asked if I would be willing to take pictures for my step sisters wedding to help them save money. She asked me to do it as a gift. She knows that Tina hates me and I pretty much reciprocate. I decided to be the bigger person and agreed. 

I was there for the makeup and the wedding party getting dressed, I took a ton of pictures bat the wedding. I prepared a checklist of all the different formals she wanted and made sure I got them all. I did my absolute best. 

When I got to the reception there was no place for me to sit. I had gotten there right away so I could get pictures of the wedding party arriving and all that. The wedding party had stopped to use the bathroom and get freshened up. 

I called my mom to find out where I was meant to sit and eat and stuff. She talked to Tina and called me back. She was upset and I could tell. She said that Tina thought since I was working and not a guest she didn't have to have a seat and food for me. 

I thanked my mom for the information and left. 

I took my boyfriend who was my assistant that day and we went out for dinner my treat. We had been on the go for eight hours by then. 

I turned off my phone. We had a nice night out and we saw the new  Mad Max movie. 

Sunday morning I turned on my phone. It was full of messages asking where I went. Then demanding I come take pictures. Then cursing me out. 

I called my mom to see what was up. She said that Tina was very upset that I left and that all her reception pictures were going to be from cell phone cameras. She said I should have just gone to get a quick bite at McDonald's and then come back. 


I told her that I felt terrible and would of course give a full refund. I also said that this was the last straw and that I did not want to hear shit when I did not invite Tina to my wedding next year.

73,1db5jke,AITA for getting a cat?,"I (29F) just moved into a house with one other person (I’ll call her A, 26F) and her dog. Her dog roams free throughout the house and is allowed on all furniture. On Saturday I asked A if I was allowed to get a cat. She said yes, the landlords don’t care and her dog has been around cats. On Monday, I went to the pound and put a cat on hold. I told A I planned to bring a cat home tomorrow, asking again to confirm that it was ok. 

She said she’s really not a cat person and doesn’t want cat everywhere. A previous roommate had a cat that meowed all day and the house smelled like cat, so she was nervous about that. But she also said that she wants me to feel like this is my home and wants me to be able to have a cat. I asked if it would make her uncomfortable if I brought the cat home, and she said she’s willing to try but her big concern is that the dog and cat need to get along. 

So I brought the cat home. I have a private entrance into my bedroom and brought her in through that door. Before I left for work the next day, I told A if the cat was meowing/bothering her to text me and I’ll come home. She said she forgot the cat was here and asked to meet her. Then I left for work and got no text about any noise/disturbance. 

On her way out the door that evening, A told me that she’s really nervous about the cat. It already smells like litter and there’s quite a bit of hair in my room. All cat related things are in my room - so while I agree that my room smells like litter, the house does not smell like litter. The cat has also not left my room, so there’s no hair or litter outside of my room. The next day I texted her asking if she was free later to chat about the cat. 

I opened the conversation by saying I don’t think she can live with a cat and she agreed. I asked if we could compromise and if the cat could stay for 2 months, we’ll find a new place to live when the lease ends in August. She was upset and said if having a cat was so important I should have told her in our interview. This felt impulsive and she reverted to people pleasing when I asked, which is the only reason she said yes. She said she was very clear about no other pets being allowed on the house listing and that the last roommate moved out because he wanted a cat. She also doesn’t want to have to keep doors closed and is concerned the cat/dog haven’t met. 

I don’t remember the details of the house listing, I applied for a number of houses and moved from overseas so it was a busy time for me. I also didn’t know the previous roommate left because he wanted a cat. Had she said no when I asked, I wouldn’t have gotten the cat. 

I said the cat would need a few days before meeting the dog and she said the cat absolutely needs to be gone before then. I said ok but I would still be moving out when the lease ends. The conversation ended and she was slamming doors before leaving to spend the night at her boyfriend’s house.

74,1db56tr,AITA for refusing to tattoo at my cousins wedding?,"(Throwaway because I’m not sure if my family uses Reddit lol)

So a little to my background: I am a tattoo artist. I’ve done an apprenticeship the first year of tattooing. I work as a tattoo artist for 4 years now and I opened a studio recently.

Me and my family are invited to a wedding, that is taking place in another state. My Cousin is marrying and we got the invitation a few months ago. Time has moved forward and now the wedding is in a week already. 
Out of the blue my Cousin, let’s call him Matt, texted me with something along the lines of „you’re gonna tattoo me on my wedding day“. I was a bit confused as I never even thought of bringing my equipment, since I also didn’t plan a guestspot or anything. (guestspot is a tattoo artist working at an other studio for a few days or weeks, mostly in a different area to grow the clientele)
I jokingly asked if he has a machine, as i still hoped that he wasn't serious. He then just asked if I don't have one (???) and that one machine wouldn't take up that much space to take with.
I replied that I didn’t plan on bringing my equipment, that *in fact* contains more than just a machine (color, hygiene stuff, stencil(thats the purple stuff you put on the skin to then trace the tattoo with actual needles) etc) and that I'm not prepared to tattoo *at a wedding* of which i don't know anything about (layout of the location, is it inside/outside and so on)
He then said that he had planned on this and that it would mean a lot to him to both get a tattoo on his wedding day and that I'd be the one to tattoo him. Remember that this is the first time I'm hearing this.
I again tried to explain that I don't feel comfortable with that and that it’s quite short notice as I work until me and my brother fly over to attend the wedding and a tattoo needs to be designed first, right?
He saw my message but didn’t reply anymore.
This morning my mother called and she was furious… she asked why I couldn’t pull my shit together and just tattoo Matt. I told her what I’ve previously told Matt as well but she didn’t wanna hear it. She just said it would mean a lot to her and Matt‘s family if I’d do that and that it could be my wedding gift then she hung up.

I talked to my brother about it and he just shrugged it off and said „it would be nice of you tho“

I’m unsure what to do now, as I said I’m not really comfortable with the whole situation, especially because I’ve never been guestspotting, so I never had to travel -let alone get on a plane- with my equipment. But is that just selfish? I mean it would mean a lot to apparently everyone and I’m just saying no?

EDIT: 
1) I do have an actual wedding gift already as they sent out a wishlist with their invitations. There was a point that said Artwork, because they recently moved into a bigger house and apparently they want random artwork to decorate. I *oil painted* them a painting i spent several days on, so I also don't plan to give him a voucher as a gift.

2) Matty doesn't have any tattoos as far as I know.

75,1db53hw,AITA - Cruise Boarding,"I’m on a cruise with my father, wife, daughter, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law.

I’ve previously been on a cruise with them and we’ve almost missed boarding at a port because my MIL and SIL believed that my thought process of being on the ship (or near the port) at least 30 minutes before the last all aboard call was unreasonable.

Today, we were in a port in Spain (with our passports onboard the ship), and we were cutting it close on time. As I mentioned to the group that we needed to head out, my SIL commented that we had more than enough time to keep walking around the city. Note, this was 45 mins before the last all aboard call, Ubers don’t work very well in the city, and we weren’t sure where to find a taxi.

Ultimately, we ended up leaving as I kept insisting we had to go. I scrambled to find a taxi on a Main Street while my SIL insisted we should use Uber instead as it would fit us all (driver kept being changed and no-one was coming).

I stopped at a hotel and asked for a Main Street where we could find a taxi. I told the group where to go, and I was able to flag a taxi down while the rest of the group just waited instead of helping. Note, taxis only sit 4 here and I told them we’d need separate ones.

I finally found one that fit 4, and I went in with my daughter, wife, and father.

My MIL and SIL caught one shortly after.

They are annoyed that I didn’t flag one for them down first. In an instance where we weren’t a 20 minute drive away from the port with the last call being in 30 minutes I would’ve. But given the tight timing and them dismissing my concerns, I didn’t want to potentially miss the ship and pay for that mistake financially.

76,1db50mw,AITA for not being grateful for what my sister bought me even though I said not to buy it?,"Context: I live in the UK

My (f15) sister(f14) went to go shopping with my dad today, for whatever reason. I had a shower not long before they left and therefore couldn't leave as my hair takes hours to fully dry. So I asked my sister if she could get me a Pritt 22g gluestick as I finished mine months ago. I specifically said Pritt as they are a very good brand, albeit slightly expensive. But nonetheless they last me awhile and are reliable. Due to her having a history of messing up what she was ment to get, I physically showed her the 22g on the gluestick. Big mistake. 

Fast forward, I'm now lounging around the house and I get a text from my sister saying that there was only a 15g one not a 16g one. I wanted the 22g one as the gluestick fits absolutely perfectly in my pencil case. Anyways, confused, I texted back saying it was 22g, she apologised and said she'll go have a look. So far, no problem. 

Soon, she texts me again saying that they only had a 34g one and a 45g one. I said to get me the 34g one then. 

Fast forward again and now they're back. Along with their other shopping my sister hands me an offbrand gluestick from a brand I used to use. I'm not going to specify the brand but their gluesticks are basically just rubber and do not stick to anything. I said I wanted a Pritt gluestick and she went off at me saying that ""I didn't say anything about it having to be Pritt."" Which is false as I made it abundantly clear that it was to be a Pritt gluestick. And when I said that I even showed her the gluestick, albeit mainly focusing on the 22g part she retorted saying that ""You didn't."" And told told me, and by extension my dad, who I don't have the best relationship with due to other reasons, to ""stop being ungrateful."" 

I don't think I am being ungrateful as all I did was express disappointment with her getting the brand wrong. However, we're also quite poor, so I think she was probably calling me ungrateful as I was/am pretty bummed about not getting the more expensive, yet in my opinion worth it and useful, brand. I currently have the gluestick with me, but I offered it to my dad and my sister as I really don't want to use that brand. My dad is saying that he'll buy me a Pritt one tomorrow even though I know that he won't as he never does.

Also, she bought it with our dad's money, not her's.

77,1db4r25,AITA: au-pair family problem ,"

I (20w) am currently an au-pair in a family of mom, dad and 2 kids ( 7 yr. and 10 m.) I take care of the baby and keep company to the girl, while the mother is also at home full time. I’ve been here for 2 weeks, I have 5 left. I have some issues with the family.

When I arrived I was told to wake up when I want. I got used to starting work around 9. Couple days ago I was asked to start waking up earlier (8-9), this morning at 8.07 I woke up and was yelled at to come help. It felt annoying because they told me to *wake up* around 8-9. Not a problem for me to start at 8 but I don't like to wake up to yelling.

I have spent my free time alone but on tuesday after dinner I told the mom that I might go to center of Milan (40 mins on bus) to meet another au-pair on wednesday. She was annoyed and didn't understand why I needed to meet someone I didn't know and why would I waste so much time on a bus etc. We were supposed to go sit outside after eating but I left to brush my teeth because I needed a moment, during that time she had left and so I just went to bed. Next day they told me that they felt that it’s too complicated for me to go alone to Milan but that they would require the girl's number if I was still going. They also wondered why I won't go on my free day (saturday). I was confused on that because I had not had free days but they told me that I need to ask for them (honestly I don't mind not having free days since I'm here only for a short time and the work is not too hard). This whole thing left me confused because she was immediately mad when I mentioned other au-pair or going to the city. 

They speak little english and I'm just learning italian. I don't think that they know how much I understand because the mom speaks about me in italian. Once they laughed because the mom pointed out how close to the plate I ate (I'm tall and table is low so it looks funny ik). One time we were at a restaurant and she showed me how to eat a roll, then she said under her breath in italian that ""she doesn't understand"" and nothing wrong with that but she sounded annoyed. She has many times said [in italian] that I don't speak enough but it's hard to jump in the middle of conversation when it takes me so long to process things. Today she said something at the table that really hurt me, we were eating sausages and we all had eaten 2 and 1 was left. No one wanted it so she asked me and I took it. Then she said [in italian] that I over-eat/eat too much. I had to check from a translator but I did hear right.

I understand that we have cultural differences and me being quieter may seem rude to them but I have explained that it has nothing to do with them but it's just a combination of my personality and lack of language skills.

I (20w) am currently an au-pair in a family of mom, dad and 2 kids ( 7 yr. and 10 m.) I take care of the baby and keep company to the girl, while the mother is also at home full time. I’ve been here for 2 weeks, I have 5 left. I have some issues with the family.

When I arrived I was told to wake up when I want. I got used to starting work around 9. Couple days ago I was asked to start waking up earlier (8-9), this morning at 8.07 I woke up and was yelled at to come help. It felt annoying because they told me to *wake up* around 8-9. Not a problem for me to start at 8 but I don't like to wake up to yelling.

I have spent my free time alone but on tuesday after dinner I told the mom that I might go to center of Milan (40 mins on bus) to meet another au-pair on wednesday. She was annoyed and didn't understand why I needed to meet someone I didn't know and why would I waste so much time on a bus etc. We were supposed to go sit outside after eating but I left to brush my teeth because I needed a moment, during that time she had left and so I just went to bed. Next day they told me that they felt that it’s too complicated for me to go alone to Milan but that they would require the girl's number if I was still going. They also wondered why I won't go on my free day (saturday). I was confused on that because I had not had free days but they told me that I need to ask for them (honestly I don't mind not having free days since I'm here only for a short time and the work is not too hard). This whole thing left me confused because she was immediately mad when I mentioned other au-pair or going to the city. 

They speak little english and I'm just learning italian. I don't think that they know how much I understand because the mom speaks about me in italian. Once they laughed because the mom pointed out how close to the plate I ate (I'm tall and table is low so it looks funny ik). One time we were at a restaurant and she showed me how to eat a roll, then she said under her breath in italian that ""she doesn't understand"" and nothing wrong with that but she sounded annoyed. She has many times said [in italian] that I don't speak enough but it's hard to jump in the middle of conversation when it takes me so long to process things. Today she said something at the table that really hurt me, we were eating sausages and we all had eaten 2 and 1 was left. No one wanted it so she asked me and I took it. Then she said [in italian] that I over-eat/eat too much. I had to check from a translator but I did hear right.

I understand that we have cultural differences and me being quieter may seem rude to them but I have explained that it has nothing to do with them but it's just a combination of my personality and lack of language skills. I feel like I'm constantly judged and it's hard to do my job. I don't know what to do or say atm.

My husband just walked back and came inside as the neighbors and my landlord and his wife started arguing again, my landlord came out to his fence with a rifle on his shoulder and his wife had a pistol on her side and they proceeded to yell and said stuff about shooting.

While the cops were at the house with the landlord we went to talk to the neighbors and explain that we have nothing to do with anything they have going on drama wise. In the end the cop came back to the neighbors and stated that he didn’t care who it was but if he had to come back someone would be spending the weekend in jail. My fear is that this will continue til it escalates too far and I fear kids will be caught in it as I always have my niece over and she’s always playing with the neighbor kids, and I also worry the landlord might begin to be a little rude to us as he seen us talk to the neighbors.

79,1db4fb1,WIBTAH for uninviting my friends on a waterpark trip with 10 friends because they don’t want to go to the water park?,"Pretty much the title. I have 10 water park tickets and we’ve invited ten people to go to the park and get an airbnb to split together for three days. 

I invited our couple-friends and they took some time to think about it and eventually said “We are down, but we are good on the amusement parks. [Spouse] has been wanting to see the historical stuff and I'm digging some aquarium action”

Now I want to uninvite them because 
1. They won’t be buying one of the tickets I already have, meaning I’ll be inviting two more people bringing the group to 12. 
2. I think it’ll be weird to link up with them after a full day if everyone else enjoying the park as a friend group (not awkward just kind of weird) 
3. I’ll have to look for a bigger airbnb which could raise the price per person (not 100% sure yet)


My doubts come from:
1. I could be overreacting to the severity of the idea that someone wouldn’t join the rest of the friends in the adventure specifically intended to go to a water park
2. They’d still pay part of the Airbnb cost even though they won’t be going on day adventures with the crew. 


Edit for FAQs:

I bought 10 tix on the last day of a sale so it’s cheaper to buy from me than get their own at this point. Worst case I’m not opposed to returning a few tix but would rather everyone invited actually has the same experience and we all go out together. 

I’m not worried about finding more people to go and fill in the two spots.

83,1db35a6,AITA for asking my partner not to prospect my boss?,"Quick background: my workplace is in a bit of turmoil at the moment. In our region we’re a small team of around 15, and the leadership team (including me) have only been with the business for about year. The VP of Sales quit and left 1 month ago, and the MD has just resigned. Senior Leadership are flying in last minute from the US next week, to try and keep things from completely falling apart. This couldn’t come at a worse time for me: I’ve just completed a failed IVF cycle last week, my 40th birthday is tomorrow (and this upcoming visit is overshadowing it in my mind) and we’re moving house and suburb next weekend. 

Another bit of background: my partner (romantic) works in recruitment as a director of a newly formed division for a small agency.

This evening I was telling my partner how overwhelmed I’m feeling and how stressed I feel about the meetings coming up next week. He gave me some (considerate) advice, but then somehow got onto the topic of him planning to reach out to my US EVP (who is here next week), to let him know he could help him to fill the vacant roles.

When I was with my previous employer he reached out to the CEO (my then boss) as a prospective new business lead without first mentioning it to me. I was unhappy when I found out (through my boss) as I’d rather he did not approach the organization I work for and particularly my manager.

When it came up again tonight, I told him again that I do not want him prospecting with my employer. He can speak to any of the previous companies I’ve worked for, and the thousands of other companies out there available to prospect with. My employer is the one single organization I do not want him approaching. 

He immediately got angry and told me that he takes this as me insinuating that I don’t think he’s good at his job, or will do a good job in filling these vacancies. I explained this has nothing to do with my beliefs about his capabilities, instead I just do not want my personal life mixing with my work life. For example, if my employer was to engage his services and things went sour, I’d worry it might reflect badly on me.

Again, he took this as me not believing he would do a good job. He told me how hard it is to win new business and was upset and angry that I would try and prevent him from securing this deal.

This resulted in a HUGE fight - one of our largest. On the eve of this special birthday. This upset me even more than it would have done on an “ordinary” night, as I don’t understand why he used this particular evening to engage in this discussion. To me it felt inconsiderate and selfish.

86,1db2snm,AITA for not taking my mom’s dog?,"AITAH for not wanting to take my mom’s animals?

So there is a lot of backstory to this, so I am gonna try and keep it short. 

My mom recently helped me and my wife purchase a house and has always helped financially if I have needed anything. I feel this is important to state for what is to come!

We are from the US but live I live in Europe. My mom moved back over here about 2 years ago to be closer to me and the grandchildren. 

She has always had animals and cared very well for them, like EXTREMELY well. Most of the time the dogs and cats have lived to around 16-18 years old. Anyway when she came here she went to the vet with her very old dog, like around 16-17 at the time. They treat vet care here a little different than in the US compared to over here and considering a lot of the problems the dog had they didn’t want to treat the dog and instead advised her to euthanize it due to QoL etc. 

Obviously she didn’t agree, So fast forward some time and several different vets complaining to the authorities about the QoL of her dog and they came and took the dog and euthanized it. 

( I have to add her dog was just very old, she treated that dog like a princess and this is not a post about “animal cruelty” so please don’t focus to much on that ) 

So anyway she was devastated and thought about leaving the country we live in to go back to the US but ended up staying and getting a new puppy. 

But the authorities now have prosecuted her on the grounds of animal cruelty ( I honestly don’t agree with this ) but it is what is. Now she is gonna leave because they will take her animals if they find that she owns any. So she now wants us to take her puppy and cat ( the cat I am fine with ) for an unspecified amount of time until she figures everything out and if she is gonna stay in Europe or move back to the US. 

My problem is this, we have two small children ( a 3 year old and a 7 month old baby) and we also have a teenage daughter, she obviously has her own life and is out and about with friends and at times comes home late. When my mom has visited us and had the dog with her, my daughter has woken up the dog when coming home and then the dog starts barking until it wakes up the whole house.

Adding a puppy to the equation is like having another small child. 

My mom says she always helps me when I need it, although I can honestly say that it’s no more than I consider is normal when it comes to helping family. She says I am ungrateful and it’s fucked up I won’t help her in this situation. 

My wife and teenage daughter don’t think it’s wrong of me to say no to my mom, but I want to hear from people that don’t know me if IATAH for not wanting to take the dog ??",Not the A-hole,2024-06-08,"AITA for not taking my mom’s dog? AITAH for not wanting to take my mom’s animals?

So there is a lot of backstory to this, so I am gonna try and keep it short. 

My mom recently helped me and my wife purchase a house and has always helped financially if I have needed anything. I feel this is important to state for what is to come!

We are from the US but live I live in Europe. My mom moved back over here about 2 years ago to be closer to me and the grandchildren. 

She has always had animals and cared very well for them, like EXTREMELY well. Most of the time the dogs and cats have lived to around 16-18 years old. Anyway when she came here she went to the vet with her very old dog, like around 16-17 at the time. They treat vet care here a little different than in the US compared to over here and considering a lot of the problems the dog had they didn’t want to treat the dog and instead advised her to euthanize it due to QoL etc. 

Obviously she didn’t agree, So fast forward some time and several different vets complaining to the authorities about the QoL of her dog and they came and took the dog and euthanized it. 

( I have to add her dog was just very old, she treated that dog like a princess and this is not a post about “animal cruelty” so please don’t focus to much on that ) 

So anyway she was devastated and thought about leaving the country we live in to go back to the US but ended up staying and getting a new puppy. 

But the authorities now have prosecuted her on the grounds of animal cruelty ( I honestly don’t agree with this ) but it is what is. Now she is gonna leave because they will take her animals if they find that she owns any. So she now wants us to take her puppy and cat ( the cat I am fine with ) for an unspecified amount of time until she figures everything out and if she is gonna stay in Europe or move back to the US. 

My problem is this, we have two small children ( a 3 year old and a 7 month old baby) and we also have a teenage daughter, she obviously has her own life and is out and about with friends and at times comes home late. When my mom has visited us and had the dog with her, my daughter has woken up the dog when coming home and then the dog starts barking until it wakes up the whole house. We all feel that taking in a puppy is to much of an ask, we feel we don’t have the time to actually take care of it and don’t what the extra responsibility, considering we both work and the rest of the time is spent on the kids.

92,1db1jgr,AITA for arguing with my mother in law about putting the family dog down without warning?,"My wife (23) has had a family dog, living with her grandma, that they jointly had responsibility for, for 10 years. I randomly get a message from my mother in law, asking what time my wife is going to work, and that she will call me when she leaves. Super weird. I get the call, and she tells me they had put the dog down the night before, and had a burial for it. Now here is where I get pissed. When my wife was 12 years old, their last family dog was put down the same way, unbeknownst to her. She was told the next day, and the dog was gone incinerated and buried. This dog was the most important being to her, honestly I'm like number two.

So I got pissed off and asked some questions:

1. Why didn't you call her as soon as the dog was sick? Why didn't you give her the option?
2. Even if she couldn't make it to be with the dog before you put her down, she deserved at the very least to know BEFORE I did?
3. Why are you still avoiding her? Why are you calling me? Of course i'll be there for her when she gets the news, but don't you think SHE should know? As the joint caretaker for this dog????
4. Why did you bury the dog and have a funeral for her WITHOUT her? Literally, she could have take n bus, and been there in 2hrs. It would have meant the world to her.

My wife has been scarred and been super afraid of anything like this happening again. And of course it happens. The response of my mother in law?

I shouldn't be having an opinion on this, and I shouldn't be putting guilt on her. It's not my place. I should be thinking about my wifes grandmother and how she feels. There wasn’t enough time anyways, so it couldn't have been ANY different.

I went to my wifes work, and talked to her boss to get her the day off, and then i broke her the news. She has been balling her eyes out since. I convinced her to call her grandma for some closure to help her hear how the final moments of the dogs life was, which i said would help her grieve in a healthier way. She is currently in the shower, bawling her eyes out. She said she is so upset she didn't get the chance to see the dog, nor did she get a call from either of them..

94,1db0f5d,AITA for telling my SIL she should be ashamed of herself and learn to be a mature adult?,"My brother had two kids with his ex by the time he was 21. He stuck around for a couple of years but when they broke up he left the kids too. He paid no child support, made no effort to keep in touch with the kids, did not check if they were okay, nothing. The rest of my family let the relationship drop too but I (38m) was the exception. I stayed part of my niece and nephew's lives. I still have a good relationship with them today and they're close to my kids.

Five years ago my brother got married and now he's expecting baby #3 with his wife. After settling into family life he started to think more about his oldest two and he made the decision to reach out to them. He was met with silence initially and then after speaking to his ex, he got a brief message from his kids that they were still mad and hurt that he left. They had contact for about a month and it was sporadic. He asked if they could meet in person and the kids said no. But they said they would do a video call with him one time and that was it. This call happened 2.5 months into their ""reconciliation"". At some point during this he mentioned wanting them to meet his wife and other kids. They told him that was not going to happen and they didn't want to reconcile with him. My brother was surprised, he had thought that them opening up to him about being angry and hurt was a sign that they were willing to work through that. They told him it would be one thing if he hadn't settled down and started a family all over again but the fact he did that and then reached out to them was too much for them and they want nothing to do with the family he created now. This led to a back and forth where he said they have younger siblings and they told him very clearly they will never acknowledge or accept them as siblings and they will never accept him as their dad and he needs to move on.

I spoke to my niece and nephew after the call, they reach out to me, and they said it was good to close that door and to have the decision be their own. They felt like they got closure.

My brother wasn't prepared for the outcome and his wife is furious that my niece and nephew rejected them for existing. She started badmouthing the kids at my parents house in front of all of us. My brother told her to stop. But she told him they should be ashamed of themselves for reacting like spoiled brats who don't get their way and punishing innocent children when they're supposed to be grown adults now. I told SIL she should be ashamed of herself for talking like that about the kids my brother abandoned and didn't give a second thought to until he had settled down with her and their kids. I told her she should learn to be a mature adult and accept that his actions had consequences and this is one of them. Cue her being offended and saying I have no right to speak to her that way and some of my family telling me I should have said nothing.

He stuck around for a couple of years but when they broke up he left the kids too. He paid no child support, made no effort to keep in touch with the kids, did not check if they were okay, nothing. The rest of my family let the relationship drop too but I (38m) was the exception. I stayed part of my niece and nephew's lives. I still have a good relationship with them today and they're close to my kids.

Five years ago my brother got married and now he's expecting baby #3 with his wife. After settling into family life he started to think more about his oldest two and he made the decision to reach out to them. He was met with silence initially and then after speaking to his ex, he got a brief message from his kids that they were still mad and hurt that he left. They had contact for about a month and it was sporadic. He asked if they could meet in person and the kids said no. But they said they would do a video call with him one time and that was it. This call happened 2.5 months into their ""reconciliation"". At some point during this he mentioned wanting them to meet his wife and other kids. They told him that was not going to happen and they didn't want to reconcile with him. My brother was surprised, he had thought that them opening up to him about being angry and hurt was a sign that they were willing to work through that. They told him it would be one thing if he hadn't settled down and started a family all over again but the fact he did that and then reached out to them was too much for them and they want nothing to do with the family he created now. This led to a back and forth where he said they have younger siblings and they told him very clearly they will never acknowledge or accept them as siblings and they will never accept him as their dad and he needs to move on.

I spoke to my niece and nephew after the call, they reach out to me, and they said it was good to close that door and to have the decision be their own. They felt like they got closure.

My brother wasn't prepared for the outcome and his wife is furious that my niece and nephew rejected them for existing. She started badmouthing the kids at my parents house in front of all of us. My brother told her to stop. But she told him they should be ashamed of themselves for reacting like spoiled brats who don't get their way and punishing innocent children when they're supposed to be grown adults now. I told SIL she should be ashamed of herself for talking like that about the kids my brother abandoned and didn't give a second thought to until he had settled down with her and their kids. I told her she should learn to be a mature adult and accept that his actions had consequences and this is one of them. Cue her being offended and saying I have no right to speak to her that way and some of my family telling me I should have said nothing.

95,1db09l9,AITA for telling my sister she shouldn't camp out on dying brother's living room floor.,"This is my first post on Reddit so apologies if I am breaking any rules etc.

We are three siblings spread over Europe.  Due to our upbringing, we are not terribly close and generally only contact each other when absolutely necessary.  We are all retired or not working at mom. 

My (f58) brother (53) is dying of cancer and only has a few months left if he's lucky (he got diagnosed just before Christmas).  He has an 8 year old son.  It's so sad.

I spoke to his wife just after they got the news and said that, although I will visit, I felt that they should have time to digest and come to terms with the situation before I descend on them (at the time docs were giving brother good vibes) as I felt that being there, as a guest (staying at nearby hotel or something), may put extra pressure on them when they were too fragile.  I said to wife, while I cannot help situation, if she needed to scream, swear, vent or just wanted different advice or point of view I was a phone call away.

Now to the present.   During a conversation with my sister (56) she mentioned that she had visited bro almost immediately and had camped out on their living room floor on a blow up bed.  She said that this time she would probably stay there until bro dies.

... And here's where I am probably the AH in two ways: 

(1) I said that imo it was not a good idea having someone camping out on their living room floor for the duration given they were coping with bro dying and most likely she would only add to their stress.  Sister is strapped for cash and will not be able to afford to pay room/board costs elsewhere for an extended time.  I feel that this will invade their privacy.  

(2) Bro told sister that he does not want wife at his side when he dies to spare her and he said wife agrees.  I feel that's unfair on wife who will do and say anything he wants now.  Although this is happening to him, once it's over, his wife will be left grieving and trying to tell son it's all going to be ok.  I want to tell him that's not good for them after he's gone.  I can understand his stance, but think he is being blinkered by his need to care for wife/son.

I really need to know if (1) am I the AH for saying this to sister?  Should I apologise and keep my opinion to myself as it is possible she could be of help in some way.  (2) Should I speak to bro and if so, how should I go about it?  WIBTAH for interfering with their decision?
 

EDIT (I am not sure I am doing this the right way, but here goes).

Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to respond to my post.  I am grateful to all of you.  I hope this edit(?) answers a lot of commenters’ points.

I have not yet spoken to my brother about his decision to exclude his wife from his deathbed as some seem to think.   However, as I mentioned, although this is happening to him his wife is going to have to pick up the pieces once he is gone and I would not like her to go through the rest of her life regretting this.  Bro worked in care home and I think he is remembering the deaths of patients and that is making him worry for his wife. I have personal experience of this type of regret that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.  I will listen to him before I say anything.

It was also asked why I want my bro/wife/son to be alone so badly, that I am being cruel.  They are not alone, far from it thankfully.  My brother now lives in a very family orientated society and he thrived in it. It is so different from our own dysfunctional upbringing.  His wife’s family and his close friends are ensuring that help and support cushion his last days and his family’s needs.  My sister said she was very impressed by it all.  To put into perspective how distant we all are, sister has not communicated with bro since her last visit (over five months ago) and expects after spending a few days in a hotel with me to just set out a blow-up mattress in the middle of their home and stay until he dies.  Commenters have also suggested my bro/wife should simply be able to tell her to go – I would like to avoid the added stress of that situation for them altogether if possible.  She has not told bro this is what she is planning yet. 

One said my sister seemed more compassionate because she wants to be there as a shoulder to cry on.  I am in a rock and a hard place here – my BIL is also dying from a different cancer.  My husband is really close to his brother and is devastated.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that bro and BIL will go into hospice end of life care around the same time.  I need to support the man I vowed to stand by over all else.  I am all he’s got.  Bro has lots of support in wife’s family and his friends who, frankly, are much closer to him than sister or I have ever been in the last 40 years. They are really great people and I am so thankful for their compassion.

One commenter asked whether I could pay for sister to stay somewhere.  I did think of this and looked up the cost.  In the region of £700 pm would be needed for basic room, shared bills, subsistence etc.  I simply don’t have that kind of money to give her.  I did offer to let her share my hotel room of course. 

Finally, someone says our bro has different relationships with each sister.  Of course he does.  He thinks our sister is a selfish freeloader (a polite translation of his terms) and it has caused him to have as little contact with her as possible.   He probably thinks I am a cold bitch but can be relied on to get him out of a pinch.  I am also not trying to direct my brother's death or believe I am trying to compensate for something.  I know my brother, he is impulsive, stubborn and has great love and pride in his family.  Of course I don't want sister to cause him stress due to her unconsidered actions.  I want to know he is not alienating his wife at the end, causing her hurt and regret she will have to live with due to his fears.

97,1dazxk2,AITA saying I will not spend Father's Day with my stepfather instead of my dad?,"My parents divorced 10 years ago. My mom got remarried 8 years ago. For the last 3 years I (17M) have lived with my dad and I spend one weekend a month at my mom's house. Before that it was 50/50. But regardless of the custody split I always spent Mother's Day with my mom and Father's Day with my dad. That didn't change just because she got remarried. But this year my mom is planning a special day out of my stepfather and he wants me to spend Father's Day with him/them, which includes my four half siblings. I said no. My stepfather told me I always spend Father's Day with my dad and I live with him now, and hardly ever see him and my mom, and this is a big year because it's the first year with our ""completed family"" and the last one before I'm finished high school and I should invest in time with my family but especially him, because I never let him in as a second dad and always treat him like he's just my mom's husband.

He went on and on about how much he wants to connect with me and to feel like I appreciate him as a fatherly presence in my life. He told me the day would be fun too so it's not like he's dragging me fishing or to sit watching paint dry. He told me I could easily celebrate both of them, just on different days, and my dad's plans are always easier to do another day but this special day out relies on certain Father's Day activities. I kept saying no. I didn't reconsider at any point.

My mom asked me to do it for just this one year. She told me it meant so much to my stepfather. I told her I wanted to be with my dad on Father's Day.

When my stepfather asked me again I told him I won't spend Father's Day with him over my dad and he needs to accept that because my mind is not changing. He told me being so absolute about this is not showing me in a very good light right now.

98,1dazfh2,AITA for telling my partner that I emotionally can’t handle spending entire weekends at his parents house? ,"My boyfriend (M28) and I (F26) have been together for four years. I moved back home this year as I started up a postgrad program and couldn’t afford to live alone with a part time job salary.  I come from a pretty stable family background, so I know I speak from a perspective of not having these genuine and  valid pressures and burdens with my parents. Makes me feeling like I’m throwing stones from my glass house. 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, comes from an extremely dysfunctional family with issues with alcoholism, abuse etc. He has never moved out because his income is keeping his parents afloat (no one works except him, so he is supporting all of them practically). Noteworthy, he pays more rent to his parents for a tiny room than he would for a pretty nice apartment in a decent area. 

His family home is chaos in every sense of the word. The environment, the parents themselves, the drinking, the health crises, the shouting. They are not bad people and I don’t not want them in my life - but for short spurts at a time so I can protect my own well-being and energy. 

I work and study in mental health,  and am surrounded by heaviness all week. For me, it is important to spend my personal time actively restoring my energy - and I’ve come to realise that I genuinely need a degree of positivity around me so that I can do that. I don’t expect to have only light and rainbows because that is not realistic, but the level of stress I experience at his house isn’t conducive to the restoration I am needing. 

There was an incident two weeks back that really unsettled me when I was there. The penny dropped and I decided I just can’t spend entire weekends there.

Our team was very lucky to be able to make it into the World Championships this year (which we have never done before!) I was so happy and excited to see it. I am the business captain on our team so I don’t really care much for the actual matches than I do logistics and community outreach. I will occasionally watch a few matches, but not much just to have fun. 

I visited almost every event at the championships, there were many different stands and different things to do besides the matches such as fairs or visiting other teams booths. On the last day we’re the finals of the entire championship. Our team did not make it in, but some of us were still watching. I wasn’t too interested in the finals, since it took a lot of waiting time to actually see one match, and the good seats were reserved for the teams that were actually playing in the finals. Our team has around 15 mentors, so I asked two of them (42F & 45M) if we had to watch the finals if we didn’t want to. They told me no, so I figured I was fine if I didn’t want to watch the entire thing.

I watched about two matches of the early parts of the finals, then was outside with my friends at one of the events the place hosted. There were many strobing lights in the arena and not very good seats so it didn’t seem worth it to watch the finals in there, so we went outside and watched it on our phones. I was with a group of about 8 other people on the team who weren’t interested in the finals.

Since after the finals we just had to go straight to the hotel, I asked on behalf of the group if we could go early since we weren’t watching the finals in person. My coach, (48F), said that I should be watching the finals and she was disappointed I wasn’t. She then proceeded to call me ungrateful and unappreciative and told me how hard the mentors have worked to get us here.  She dropped exactly how much money it cost us (which was a lot, but I’ll keep private) and kept telling me how mad and disappointed she was. I offered to sit with her and the team in the stands, but we wouldn’t fit, so I had to find seats that we couldn’t even see the matches in and sit there for the last 20 minutes to make her happy. All of this was over text. 

Ever since, we both haven’t mentioned anything about this. I’ve thought about it a lot and don’t know if I was truly being ungrateful by not watching the finals.

I was with a group of about 8 other people on the team who weren’t interested in the finals.

Since after the finals we just had to go straight to the hotel, I asked on behalf of the group if we could go early since we weren’t watching the finals in person. My coach, (48F), said that I should be watching the finals and she was disappointed I wasn’t. She then proceeded to call me ungrateful and unappreciative and told me how hard the mentors have worked to get us here.  She dropped exactly how much money it cost us (which was a lot, but I’ll keep private) and kept telling me how mad and disappointed she was. I offered to sit with her and the team in the stands, but we wouldn’t fit, so I had to find seats that we couldn’t even see the matches in and sit there for the last 20 minutes to make her happy. All of this was over text. 

Ever since, we both haven’t mentioned anything about this. I’ve thought about it a lot and don’t know if I was truly being ungrateful by not watching the finals. AITA?",1.0,0.05423726513981819,0,0

102,1days88,AITA for implying my brother is responsible for his ex's decisions?,"This is a conflict between me (25f) and my brother (30m). My brother has a 7 year old daughter with his ex wife  (30f). Right now he's ""engaged"" to his current partner (28f). They've been together 2 years.

So my brother and his ex are high school sweethearts who got married right after graduation and they had my niece a few years later. My brother always knew his ex had the ""blended family isn't real family"" ""stepfamily isn't real family"" ""half siblings aren't real siblings"" mindset. She had a blended family and she did not consider them her family, just bio. She was always very anti step/half in general.  When they were newly married they were asked to leave my aunt and uncle's house because my uncle is technically my cousins adoptive father (formerly step) and my brother's ex was spewing that nonsense in their house. 

His ex always talked about how her kids would know family is blood, family is real mom, real dad, real siblings, and would never ever have a family relationship with any steps. My brother knew this before they had my niece. He still had my niece with her and when they broke up when my niece was 2 he never acknowledged the fact it was going to be difficult for him to partner up again and have a decent household when my niece was being raised with those views.

This is where his partner (he calls her fiancée) comes in. They've been dating for two years and my niece does not acknowledge her as dad's girlfriend and is generally kinda hostile to her. It's not adult levels but she says a lot of the stuff her mom has taught her. So when my brother proposed his girlfriend said she couldn't say yes at that moment and she asked for couples counseling. Apparently she loves my brother but has her doubts about the future with my niece's views and reluctance to accept her. She said she doesn't want to make things worse and doesn't want a household where the child isn't comfortable with her. Plus she wants children and knowing how my niece feels it's a concern for her.

My brother is really starting to worry he will lose her now. He was talking to me about it and I told him he should have considered this when he divorced, because he knew how his ex spoke to their daughter and the views she was teaching her. He told me that's not his fault and how dare I blame him for his ex's decisions. I said I'm not blaming him for her decisions. I'm blaming him for not taking those into consideration and not counteracting them right away. I told him he started doing it when his ex had already gotten several years of a head start on him and he only started when it was clear my niece was refusing to give his girlfriend a shot which is something his girlfriend was taking note of very clearly. He told me I am still blaming him for his ex's decisions and he also told me to fuck off.

My (30M) parents (60's)went on a trip in Italie and they asked me to pick them up at the bus station and take them back to their place. FYI their bus arrive at 2 AM. I accepted and asked them to bring me some cigarette since they are much cheaper in Italie (like half price).

They never liked the fact that I'm a smoker, so they didn't bring me back any  because ""they didnt had time"". Every time they travel they give me this shitty excuse. Remember that if they had brought me cigarettes, I would have been able to save up to 400 euros ( approx. 450$).

So this time when they called, I said that as they can't to do a simple thing for me, why should I stay awake until 2 AM, drive half an hour to pick them up and drop them at their place before going back home and finally going to bed ? I said that they should call a taxi, even at this hour it won't cost 400 € and I hang up.

104,1daychv,AITA - morning coffee drama,"Am I the Asshole?

My girlfriend 30F and I 29F have been together now for 14 months, and living together for a few months.

Recently I’ve been feeling like I have to do everything, plan everything, organise everything, suggest everything, and it’s really been tiring me. I expressed this to her and said there’s no fun in it for me anymore. We won’t even go out if I don’t suggest where to go, plan how to get there etc. One of the other things I mentioned is how she never surprises me with anything, small gestures. She asked what I’d like and as an example said like bring me a coffee in the morning, plan a date night etc. 

Anyway the next weekend comes and we are in Starbucks, she asks what my drink order is so I give her a couple of suggestions which are my fave drinks, caramel macchiato (both hot or cold), the iced brown sugar oat shaken espresso, and a cappuccino. We then discuss the crème brûlée special they have on at the  moment to which I said that sounds gross. Why would you want an eggy, custard drink. I then continued with my usual order (iced brown sugar oat shaken espresso from one of the suggestions above given to her).

The next weekend I get woken up by our ring camera telling me someone is at the door, turns out she’d nipped out to fetch a surprise coffee for me. She comes upstairs all happy and presents me with this crème brûlée iced coffee. She said the guy serving talked her into getting it for me and as she doesn’t like coffee anyway she didn’t know if it would be good or not.  I said to her thanks, but we literally spoke about this one last weekend, why would you get that? You literally have a list in your phone of the coffees I like. She was immediately reactive to this, stormed off and said she’ll throw it away. She then followed with saying she didn’t know if I’d like it so bought a chocolate Frappuccino incase… again, not on the list. I have never ordered either of these 2 drinks from Starbucks.

Basically she’s now stormed out of the house after kicking off at me that I’m never happy. I get she tried to surprise me with something nice, and she knows I’d appreciate a Starbucks on a Saturday morning; but I don’t understand why she couldn’t stick with the few coffees I like that I’d already given her. Instead she brought 2 I’ve never ordered.

If she wanted to surprise me and didn’t know what to get I’d understand, but I feel like as much as she’s tried to do a nice thing, she has failed at the first hurdle of ordering something I’d actually like (which she literally has written down in her phone). I feel like a knob as we were supposed to be going away tonight for pride weekend at Blackpool, and now she’s stormed off angry (don’t know where she is). Having only just woken up it’s not the best start of the weekend. 

Am I the asshole? Should I have just faked reaction to this crème brûlée coffee to keep the peace?

The night before the teacher's last day, Sara texted our friend group, saying that she wanted to throw a party for the teacher. I (16F) said it was a great idea. Sara then asked if anyone could bring a cake. I didn't reply to the message because there was no way for me to bring a cake at that time.

There have been a few more incidents where Sara organizes various events and then asks me to bring stuff. If it is possible for me to bring something, I do contribute.

I got really mad at this point, and I ask if we could talk privately and told her the reason for not replying to the message. This then turned into an argument.

107,1daxx77,AITA for calling my boyfriend a bum for doing literally nothing and telling him he needs to grow the fuck up?,"My partner who I'll call Matthew (19M) and I (20F), together for nearly a year, had discussions before we began dating about my military plans, which he seemed fine with. Matthew, originally from my hometown but now in Virginia for college, lacked a job, a car, and basic motivation for anything. His dream of playing Overwatch competitively contributed to his academic struggles, though he lost interest after high school.

In the first half of our relationship, I secured a job at a new restaurant and got my boyfriend a position as well. I worked as a bartender while he was a host/server, but he lost his job within a week due to poor performance and never got a job again. This pattern of avoiding responsibilities persisted throughout our relationship, with him showing little interest in adult tasks like job hunting, chores, or furthering his education. While I didn't initially mind being the sole breadwinner, it became a bigger problem later on.

  
Around November, one of Matthew's friends, alias name Jacob, visited town and rented an AirBNB for their group hangout. However, Jacob didn't invite Matthew to stay overnight, only to visit during the day. When I offered to drop Matthew off and pick him up later and pick up his dinner tab, Jacob refused to let me join, claiming his friends hated me. This sparked an argument between me and Matthew, where I refused to send him to hang out with people who hated me openly and Matthew insisted I let him go regardless, saying things like ""You're supposed to be there for me"".

We end up breaking up after this because I realize that among this (and other things, like getting mad at me for not performing up to his standards in casual Overwatch games / being a hypocrite in other games) he was childish and immature. Few months later, February, we get back together after some reconciling. However, things took a turn for the worse. 

Matthew became absorbed in Final Fantasy Online while attending college in Virginia neglecting his classes and homework because he deemed them a waste of time. Despite his struggles, he asked for help with his assignments while I juggled a full-time job and military preparations. Amidst this, I lost my military job and considered returning to college. Matthew offered to help me secure an esports scholarship, but I was hesitant as I prioritized academics. I landed a new military job in the medical field, which was perfect because I planned to pursue medical after military duties. However, Matthew's response was dismissive and belittling (ex. ""You don't really know what's going on) as he felt abandoned despite knowing my military ambitions from the beginning of our relationship.

I visited him recently, likely for the last time before leaving for BMT on July 9th. We planned a trip to New York, with me flying in. Despite asking him to clean his apartment room and to earn some extra money through DoorDash, his place was a mess upon my arrival, with litter strewn across the floor, dirty laundry everywhere, and weeks-old trash accumulating. He also mentioned having only $40 to his name. During our stay, he showed no initiative, spending his days gaming while I covered all expenses for our New York trip, including tolls, gas, train tickets, and the AirBNB. My hobby of collecting anime figures was of no importance to him as he refused to accommodate my interests and demanded equal spending on himself no matter where we went.

The tipping point came with the release of the Destiny DLC. Despite knowing the demands of the game and his need to focus on school and his collegiate Overwatch commitments, he persisted in wanting to play. His friends, who only engaged with him for gaming, exacerbated the situation. Despite my attempts to reason with him about the importance of other priorities, he remained obstinate. Eventually, I relented and bought him the DLC to appease him, despite my financial constraints and due to his incessant nagging.

On the day of the release, he woke up early, solely to be prepared for the raid in Destiny. While this wouldn't typically be an issue, it highlighted an issue where he neglected to wake up early during my visits, hindering our plans. Instead, we often spent our time indoors, with him frequently sleeping in until late afternoon.

 Upon returning from work (4-10, he woke up at 12 maybe even earlier my time), I expected him to take a break from gaming, but he continued playing for hours without pause, probably with no attention to things like his homework assignments / eating food.

**AITA**?",TL;DR,2024-06-08,"AITA for calling my boyfriend a bum for doing literally nothing and telling him he needs to grow the fuck up? My partner who I'll call Matthew (19M) and I (20F), together for nearly a year, had discussions before we began dating about my military plans, which he seemed fine with. Matthew, originally from my hometown but now in Virginia for college, lacked a job, a car, and basic motivation for anything. His dream of playing Overwatch competitively contributed to his academic struggles, though he lost interest after high school.

In the first half of our relationship, I secured a job at a new restaurant and got my boyfriend a position as well. I worked as a bartender while he was a host/server, but he lost his job within a week due to poor performance and never got a job again. This pattern of avoiding responsibilities persisted throughout our relationship, with him showing little interest in adult tasks like job hunting, chores, or furthering his education. While I didn't initially mind being the sole breadwinner, it became a bigger problem later on.

  
Around November, one of Matthew's friends, alias name Jacob, visited town and rented an AirBNB for their group hangout. However, Jacob didn't invite Matthew to stay overnight, only to visit during the day. When I offered to drop Matthew off and pick him up later and pick up his dinner tab, Jacob refused to let me join, claiming his friends hated me. This sparked an argument between me and Matthew, where I refused to send him to hang out with people who hated me openly and Matthew insisted I let him go regardless, saying things like ""You're supposed to be there for me"".

We end up breaking up after this because I realize that among this (and other things, like getting mad at me for not performing up to his standards in casual Overwatch games / being a hypocrite in other games) he was childish and immature. Few months later, February, we get back together after some reconciling. However, things took a turn for the worse. 

Matthew became absorbed in Final Fantasy Online while attending college in Virginia neglecting his classes and homework because he deemed them a waste of time. Despite his struggles, he asked for help with his assignments while I juggled a full-time job and military preparations. Amidst this, I lost my military job and considered returning to college. Matthew offered to help me secure an esports scholarship, but I was hesitant as I prioritized academics. I landed a new military job in the medical field, which was perfect because I planned to pursue medical after military duties. However, Matthew's response was dismissive and belittling (ex. ""You don't really know what's going on) as he felt abandoned despite knowing my military ambitions from the beginning of our relationship.

I visited him recently, likely for the last time before leaving for BMT on July 9th. We planned a trip to New York, with me flying in. Despite asking him to clean his apartment room and to earn some extra money through DoorDash, his place was a mess upon my arrival, with litter strewn across the floor, dirty laundry everywhere, and weeks-old trash accumulating. He also mentioned having only $40 to his name. During our stay, he showed no initiative, spending his days gaming while I covered all expenses for our New York trip, including tolls, gas, train tickets, and the AirBNB. My hobby of collecting anime figures was of no importance to him as he refused to accommodate my interests and demanded equal spending on himself no matter where we went.

The tipping point came with the release of the Destiny DLC. Despite knowing the demands of the game and his need to focus on school and his collegiate Overwatch commitments, he persisted in wanting to play. His friends, who only engaged with him for gaming, exacerbated the situation. Despite my attempts to reason with him about the importance of other priorities, he remained obstinate. Eventually, I relented and bought him the DLC to appease him, despite my financial constraints and due to his incessant nagging.

On the day of the release, he woke up early, solely to be prepared for the raid in Destiny. While this wouldn't typically be an issue, it highlighted an issue where he neglected to wake up early during my visits, hindering our plans. Instead, we often spent our time indoors, with him frequently sleeping in until late afternoon.

 Upon returning from work (4-10, he woke up at 12 maybe even earlier my time), I expected him to take a break from gaming, but he continued playing for hours without pause, probably with no attention to things like his homework assignments / eating food.

I told him that we need to talk, where I express my frustration, telling him that he's a bum and that he needs to grow the fuck up. He responds defensively, accusing me of being impatient and cruel. His emotional reactions during arguments, including crying and tantrums, are a recurring issue.

109,1daxtvw,AITA for speaking to my stepmom like she's dumb?,"My stepmom has been in my life since I was 4 and my siblings were 2 and 1. Our parents are divorced. Our mom is not in our lives anymore and she was a very inconsistent presence even when she was in our lives. I'm 17f now for context. I generally get along okay with my stepmom but this past year more than any other has been so bad.

It started when my sister (14) asked dad about mom. It was because of something that came up in school but my stepmom got so jealous when the question was asked and ever since that day she will randomly make disparaging comments about mom around us or directly to us. She has made it a point to say mom didn't want us, that mom chose mental illness over us, drugs over us (that one we never knew about and dad was pissed at her for telling us the way she did). She also made a comment to my brother another time when he was doing a project on DNA that DNA isn't so great when DNA doesn't want you.

We all pulled away from her because of this and her comments got worse over time. To the point where she was getting irate about the topic of mom and us and mom abandoning us. I told her she wasn't helping close the distance between us with her anger and comments and she told me we were treating her like trash for no reason and disrespecting her by bringing up the mom who abandoned us when she's right there. She told me she can't understand us treating her the way we have been for the last year when she is the one who raised us, not our bio mom.

I told her that her comments about our bio mom were exactly why we pulled back. I said we *know* our mom left us, we *know* she chose to leave, we *know* she isn't a good mom, but she's still our mom. She still made us. We still had a bond with her. We still have some love and mixed emotions about her. I told her nobody wants to be reminded of that day after day or have it thrown in their face. I told her she's the adult. We're the kids. She's been throwing a year long tantrum and diving us with her comments. I told her she wouldn't like it if we started making comments about her dad (who wasn't a great guy) and if we told her that her dad never loved her, he never wanted her. So why would we want to hear that about our mom. I told her if she doesn't want us to grow apart then she needs to apologize and stop making those comments, and I reiterated that a couple of times, that we pulled back because of the comments not because we're trying to disrespect her.

By the end of the conversation she told me I had spoken to her like she was dumb and I didn't need to keep making the same point over again. She told me it made her feel disrespected and she left the room. Ever since there has been a new tension there.

Two years after that we met, fell in love, got married, and had a kid. Unfortunately for me our son's birth was a catalyst for a regression for her. 

He could do no wrong. If I tried to punish or even just correct him she would get upset and start crying or fight with me. 

If he found something difficult and I wanted him to work through it or try harder she would step in and tell me to back off or actually just do it for him. 

This lead to our divorce a I wanted to be a father and not a spectator. She fought so I wouldn't get custody. I ended up with visitation. My kid wouldn't do anything though. He wouldn't bring his homework over and all he wanted to do was play video games. If I didn't let him he had tantrums. It was exhausting. And she would always back him up. It was always my fault. 

I remarried to my wife Diane. We have two children and are doing our best to raise them right. My son stopped coming over when he was 14. I still invite him but he rarely responds. 

My child support just stopped. His mom has been giving it to him to do whatever he wanted for the last three years. Not my problem. 

He called me to see if I could help him with money. I asked what for. He said that his mom can't give him the allowance he is used to. I asked if he was going to be attending some sort of post secondary school. He said no. 

I told him to get a job. 

His mom has lost her shit. She said she will take me back to court so her poor baby can live his life his way. I wished for the odds to be ever in her favor and hung up. Now that he is an adult I never have to talk to her again. It's too bad because I loved her very much. Not any more. 

My son asked me to help him find a job. I said I would. I told him to send me his resume. I've been waiting three weeks for it. He called me yesterday to see if I had made any progress on finding him a job. I said he never sent me his resume. He got upset that I hadn't reminded him. It was one thing. 

I told him that I was not going to motivate him to do anything, that I would be here if he needed help but that it would never be money again. 

I let him come over and helped him with a resume. I also talked to him about the trades or a community college. He is beginning to understand how fucked his future is now that his mom cannot do everything for him. He is upset with his mother now because he doesn't have life skills.

113,1daw3za,AITA for excluding my step sister and yelling at my mom?,"I, 24 m, am the oldest of my siblings. My mom just announced that she is pregnant with her affair (Now husband's) baby. I have disposable income. Because of this, I like to spend a lot of it on the 3 oldest 18f, 17f, and 14m. (throughout the story i will just call them siblings 1, 2 and 3 respectively) this will become relevant later. My bf and I had been planning a summer trip and I wanted to bring siblings 1-3. I also wanted to make it very special for the oldest because she recently graduated and is now attending a t20 so I told her that she can bring a friend.  the trip is in 3 days but we planned to pick up them today so we can all go to my boyfriend's mother's birthday party.

Anyway I went to my mother's husband's house to pick up my siblings and my step sister (15 f) was there. Now for more context my mom got re married like not even a month ago so I've only ever interacted with this girl like a total of 8 times. As we are leaving my step sister(SS) asked where we were going and when we were coming back. S1:tells her about the trip. Ss:asks if she can go. I tell her no its too last minute. My mom: why can't you take her?! your flight doesn't leave for 3 days u can get another ticket. I then said again that it was too last minute My mom:if u have money to bring s1's friend why can't u bring your sister? SS: starts to cry My mom:blames me for ss crying and asks again why i can't bring her and if ss can go instead of s1's friend. I respond with This is a present for s1 also im not going to cancel on her friend. My mom: you need to put family first  i respond with, I barely know ss and she's not even family to me (my mom then starts crying and pulls the how can u stress me out like this i'm pregnant card.) i respond with I honestly don't give af about you being pregnant when you shouldn't even be pregnant at 42. my mom: cries more and says I need to treat all my siblings the same and its unfair to single ss out.

I left and the whole drive my mom was calling and texting me non stop. I called her back and she started yelling at me saying that she is going to tell the police I kidnapped her kids. I told her i have text proof of her agreeing to let s2/3 on the trip and if she even tries to escalate this further I will go to the cops with all the neglectful things she has done to her kids.

The past couple of hours she has been basically been calling me an ah for not making my ss feel welcomed, treating my younger siblings unfairly and putting her through stress while pregnant. I did feel bad about putting her through stress and feel that maybe i shouldn't have gotten so angry infront of ss. idk am i the ah.

edit: pls don't come for ss shes like 15 and we were all yelling idk why she was crying but I don't want to assume either.

Also I regret the 42 comment and I believe that women can have kids at whatever age they want as long s there are no risks. my mom is not a first time mother and the doctor told her that pregnancy was risky in 2019 when she was pregnant with my current youngest sibling.

I, 24 m, am the oldest of my siblings. My mom just announced that she is pregnant with her affair (Now husband's) baby. I have disposable income. Because of this, I like to spend a lot of it on the 3 oldest 18f, 17f, and 14m. (throughout the story i will just call them siblings 1, 2 and 3 respectively) this will become relevant later. My bf and I had been planning a summer trip and I wanted to bring siblings 1-3. I also wanted to make it very special for the oldest because she recently graduated and is now attending a t20 so I told her that she can bring a friend.  the trip is in 3 days but we planned to pick up them today so we can all go to my boyfriend's mother's birthday party.

Anyway I went to my mother's husband's house to pick up my siblings and my step sister (15 f) was there. Now for more context my mom got re married like not even a month ago so I've only ever interacted with this girl like a total of 8 times. As we are leaving my step sister(SS) asked where we were going and when we were coming back. S1:tells her about the trip. Ss:asks if she can go. I tell her no its too last minute. My mom: why can't you take her?! your flight doesn't leave for 3 days u can get another ticket. I then said again that it was too last minute My mom:if u have money to bring s1's friend why can't u bring your sister? SS: starts to cry My mom:blames me for ss crying and asks again why i can't bring her and if ss can go instead of s1's friend. I respond with This is a present for s1 also im not going to cancel on her friend. My mom: you need to put family first  i respond with, I barely know ss and she's not even family to me (my mom then starts crying and pulls the how can u stress me out like this i'm pregnant card.) i respond with I honestly don't give af about you being pregnant when you shouldn't even be pregnant at 42. my mom: cries more and says I need to treat all my siblings the same and its unfair to single ss out.

114,1daw2gd,AITA for not “cutting off” my friend?,"My (28F) boyfriend G (28M) is mad at me for not cutting off my highschool-uni friend A(28M).

For context, A and I went to high school and university together, and were in the same friend group of uni. Once we graduated we lost touch but remained in each other lives through mutual friends. 

The issue was that last year, A went to a wedding of some people of my workplace, I was invited but it was a destination wedding and I preferred not to go. A was the plus one of one of my coworkers, I work in a very serious law firm, think the one from Suits. The issue was that A got really really drunk both at the rehearsal dinner and at the wedding, and the whole weekend he was making comments about how they should fire me and hire him to work at the firm. I know this because my boss (who was at the wedding) and other coworkers told me, and told me that it did not sit well with them, and that he (A) had close the door of any opportunity to work with us. 

Well, I told my boyfriend this story, because I found it funny that my friend embarrassed himself in front of my boss and everybody else, but my boyfriend got furious and told me how I was not angry about everything that my “friend” said about me. I really did not see the issue, he was drunk, we wanted to be funny and did not go well, and that’s that, but my bf says that A disrespected me, and that he does not want to see him or be in any get together were A is, and that I should cut him off too .

Like I said, we do not talk a lot lately, so I opted for the “no contact” meaning that I will not contact A anymore, and for the whole last year A did not contacted me either, until last week. Last week another friend from uni sent me a message to go to dinner with our old friend group, including A, and I politely declined with the excuse that I had something else to do, I did not tell him about the issue, and since I did not went, I did not mention this invitation to my bf. 

Well, though another friend, my boyfriend learned of the get together and that I was invited along with A, and got angry with me because I did not “cut him off”, and we are still invited to the same events. I though that not talking to him and not going to the dinner was enough, but apparently I have to tell people that they should not invite us together. 

So, Am I the Asshole for not “cutting him off”?

Nobody in my family has been diagnosed with OCD, or ADHD besides me and my twin sister and it's a real struggle with my everyday life and clearly with hers. My 11 year old sister who we'll call Nicole has never had any issues up until 2 weeks ago. Out of nowhere when I was diagnosed she was also said to have OCD and severe anxiety (no signs of it) but nobody's taken her to be seen. I guess she might of self diagnosed herself? But besides that, the other day we were sorting clothes and helping my dads girlfriend organize her child's clothes. There was different color hangers and fun colored clothes and it was normal until I put one pink shirt on a pink hanger and she all the sudden had to do the same. Every time I put a shirt of a different color on a differed color hanger she'd flip the f*ck out. She'd say ""no put it on the blue hanger!"" or ""put it on a matching colored hanger!"" and just continuously try to match the colored shirt to the proper colored hanger. Not only did it annoy me, but did make me extremely anxious and uncomfortable. I didn't say anything that day but fast forward to today we were playing yahtzee with my dad, his girlfriend (she was on facetime) and me. Whenever it was my dads girlfriends turn she'd ask to roll for her which was okay and didn't bother me but she continued to roll it more than 3 times ""to see what she could've gotten"" once she got her desired result she stopped. Which had taken her multiple rolls. It genuinely pissed me off and I was extremely anxious because i just wanted to play the game. Every time she didn't get Yahtzee, she'd get mad and not write whatever her points were down. Whenever I went to write them for her in pencil, she'd yell at me saying ""no it must be red! i can't have it in pencil"". That's what got me. I have a very short temper but I didn't hit or yell, I just simply told her ""can you stop being so fucking picky?"" She started tearing up  and said ""but I have OCD and I need it to be perfect and the way I want it!"" Which isn't what OCD exactly is, but it can be.

I had no complaints, but when we took out the first round of foils after the suggested amount of time, my hair looked darker than before. After checking the box, it was darker than what it was before.

Here’s where I might be the asshole.

My boyfriend was already reluctant to help and took his time dying my hair.

I(M45) am signing up my daughter (F16) for a gym membership. I’ll say, she’s definitely been more on the chubby side for all of her life. When she was around 11 I started talking about her health with her, telling her she was considered obese and she should start watching her eating habits. This was after she tried getting FOUR pizzas to eat before dinner 🤣🤣. Luckily I haven’t seen her doing it again. But after that I tried getting her into a workout routine. I bought a mat for the both of us and we would work out in the living room, she seemed to always hate it.

I(M45) am signing up my daughter (F16) for a gym membership. I’ll say, she’s definitely been more on the chubby side for all of her life. When she was around 11 I started talking about her health with her, telling her she was considered obese and she should start watching her eating habits. This was after she tried getting FOUR pizzas to eat before dinner 🤣🤣. Luckily I haven’t seen her doing it again. But after that I tried getting her into a workout routine. I bought a mat for the both of us and we would work out in the living room, she seemed to always hate it.

121,1daven5,AITA for not prioritizing my mother on my wedding day?,"my husband and i got married last week and had a medium sized celebration (70 or so). as expected, not everything went exactly how i pictured it, but overall it was an amazing evening and almost everyone seemed to have a great time.

the next morning at the hangover brunch, i noticed my mom was being icy with me. she is very passive aggressive when she is upset and i could sense something was wrong. later that night, i said “i love you” and she said she didn’t think that was true because i “excluded” her from all the classic mother/daughter moments.

here’s what went down:
1) during the getting ready, i had 6 bridesmaids, plus my mother in law and mom getting ready in my parent’s hotel suite. my mom found this extremely overwhelming and said she thought it was going to be more intimate even though i had told her months ago this was the plan.

2) the makeup artist didn’t do a great job on her makeup and she was very upset. she started to have a little panic and locked herself in the bathroom just as i was about to get into my dress. we were running behind, so i told my mom that if she needed more time to get ready, my mother in law could start helping me get into the dress. apparently this caused great offense, but from my POV, i was thinking logically that i needed to get into my dress asap. she did end up helping me into my dress and we took some lovely photos of her and my sister helping me.

3) we took family photos at the hotel prior to the ceremony as my husband and i wanted more time to spend with our guests at the cocktail hour and although the plan was to take more photos at the ceremony venue, we ended up not doing that. this was my decision in the moment because a) i was feeling overwhelmed and needed a break and b) i knew we had the photos from before and would have good candid photos from the the ceremony. 

4) when it was time to bustle my dress, i was unhappy with how it looked. i asked my mom to double check the video my tailor had made. in the meantime, my makeup artist offered to help see if she could fix it. my mom was offended by this as she felt i was taking away another mother/daughter moment. 

5) when i was changing into my second dress, it was super hot in the room and i was struggling to slip the dress over my body. i was getting flustered and asked everyone who “didn’t have to be there” to leave. my mom was very upset that i said she was unessential in this moment.

since the wedding my mom has not spoken to me, she hasn’t asked how the honeymoon is going for example. i think she is hugely overreacting and is tainting my memories of the wedding. but then i wonder if i should have prioritized her more or if i actually was inconsiderate of her feelings. do mothers expect a lot of mother/daughter time at the wedding?

122,1dauyfp,WIBTA if i went on an overseas holiday with one child but not the other? ,"
I'm planning a 5 or 6 week trip to Europe and have wanted to go there for decades. My children are currently 14m and 12f.  My son has significant behaviour issues and has 'ruined' trips before. Eg, he has taken off in Sydney when we were due to catch a train home. Life with him is a daily struggle for me and his sister.  This week he's been suspended from school for 4 days, suspended from the school bus for 2 weeks, threatened his sister, insulted and sworn at us both, smashed the TV remote control (again) and more.

He has been diagnosed with ASD and ADHD but refuses to see a psychologist or entertain the idea of medication for ADHD. This is mainly because his dad (my ex) has told him there's nothing wrong with him and he doesn't need 'fixing'. I get where he was coming from but no one was telling him he needed fixing.  The psychs and myself were talking to him about learning strategies to deal with different situations etc. He seems content to use his diagnosis as an excuse rather than do anything else with the information. And I can't force him to do anything. 

When I think about going away with just my daughter, I can picture a lovely holiday. It will likely not be that way if he comes too.

124,1dauuqe,AITA for suggesting my brother contribute towards the groceries?,"This is a pretty small scale problem but I’d really like an outsiders judgement as I struggle to trust my own at times. 

So I (22F) am currently living at home before moving out in September to live with my partner. I just finished university and we are saving for a wedding. My brother (19M) is also living at home for the summer before returning to college in Sept. We both work full-time and make a similar amount of money. 
However, I have a lot more money than him in savings because 1) my school tuition was much cheaper at around $6k per year and 2) I have received quite a few scholarships and awards throughout my schooling. My brother however is going to a school that costs around $18k per year and also had an unfortunate experience last year buying a car that caused many problems that set him back quite a bit. 
I believe these are the reasons my parents have for why I currently help out paying ‘rent’ every month and he does not. To be transparent I only pay $200 per month and my parents say it is to “help out with groceries” (so not really rent). However, this amount was raised by $100 when my brother moved back home in May, most likely because my brother eats a lot and thus the grocery bill went up. I was surprised to learn today that he does not pay anything per month. He says our parents asked him to but he contested and they relented. From my perspective it is hard for me not to see this as me paying my parents more for my brother’s groceries. I told him he really should be paying and helping out and he agreed it was unfair for my contribution to be raised seemingly because of him but didn’t agree to paying. He said he’d talk to my parents but I think they might be upset that I undermined their authority and told him he should help pay.

I am aware it is a small amount of money especially compared to what many families ask for rent. I’d just love some input into whether this is actually reasonable to ask of him. Is it fair for my parents to not demand anything because my brother has less money?

I opened the window and asked if they could please turn down the music. I waited. Nothing. Then I texted her with a short message (please and thank you). Nothing. I opened the window again and asked one of her sons to ask her to please turn it down. Nothing. After about 20 mins, I got out of bed and went outside in my PJ's. Her son pointed to me and said something like, ""There she is."" It appeared that he told her I asked about the music and she chose to ignore my request.

S: But the kids... (Not sure what else she said. I could barely hear her)

But, this has been ongoing for a few weeks and I'm the one hearing complaints from my family. Last week, I asked her son to ask her to turn it down (couldn't see her from the bedroom window). I then saw and heard her say, ""Who asked to turn it down?"" I waved. She turned it down and played it at a more reasonable volume for the next few times. I thought she got the hint and would be more considerate.

Maybe I could've handled things differently. Spoke up sooner? Talked face to face at a later time? Not yelled? I was just really frustrated in the moment and had been sick in bed. So, AITA?",0.0,0.010048283264040947,0,1
129,1datu6d,WIBTA for temporarily leaving my mom’s house?,"Im 18 M currently living with my mom and her boyfriend. For a bit of context, I have been struggling in school and have recently needed to attend summer school to make up credits to graduate. Due to this my mom had taken away my laptop to get my grades up, which is fine, even though I personally think something like school is my responsibility and shouldn’t be of her concern.

Now, the problem for me is what happened later in the week. I finished summer school much earlier than anticipated from working hard and asked my mom “since I’m done can I have my laptop back?” she replied “ill think about it.” 

Next part will sound weird so for context, my mom works a 9-5 while my stepdad works as some sort of online lawyer. He has an office downstairs that he always works at throughout the day and it’s uncommon for him to ever leave it. Around noon I had wanted to quickly get some medicine for my headache at the time and I made a bad assumption that my stepdad was still downstairs. 

So I opened my parents room without knocking and he was there sleeping. I immediately said sorry, he was a little frustrated, i quickly got my medicine and i left. So what the hell does any of this have to do with my punishment? Well, my mom went in my room and said since I had walked in without knocking, she was going to keep my laptop. I tried to dispute it with her since it just seems ludicrous for me to be punished for such a small mistake, but she simply ignored me! 

I understand that I’m very technically under her roof so i should conform with what she wants, but I just don’t have to or want to deal with this. She’s withholding MY laptop that I paid for, for no reason. I need my laptop to access certain apps and for work! To me it just seems as though she wants to withhold my laptop because she thinks she has that authority over me, since I had already done everything she wanted yet still can’t catch a break.

Would I be the A H if I take my laptop and leave temporarily? I can stay at my dad’s house instead and he doesn’t have a problem with anything I’m doing. I just don’t know whether what I’m doing is an overreaction because this could strain me and my mom’s relationship since its such a big thing to do. I just think that since I’ve done everything shes asked and still cant access it, that I should put my foot down and just take it.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-08,"WIBTA for temporarily leaving my mom’s house?

130,1datl4d,AITA for wanting a little space from my family?,"So I have a very tight knit family and I live with my Mother, Father, 5 siblings (ages ranging from 16 to 2), Grandmother and Aunt (along with 2 dogs, 2 chickens and a cat)

I'm the oldest of my siblings and I have a lot of responsibilities. I get paid to look after my youngest siblings who have disabilities and I help look after my grandmother who is on the edge of her life according to the doctors. I am the main caretaker of my 2 dogs and have done my job very well. 

I went to go stay at my friend's house for the night (I asked her multiple times if I could go and she was indifferent about it) she called me, guilt tripping me about my youngest sister missing me, something she does almost every single time I stay at my friends house. In the morning I messaged and asked my mother if I could stay another night, here's basically how the conversation went. Oh and I am currently taking testosterone and she blames my irritability on that and constantly says she doesn't want to deal with a 14 year old again. 


Me: Any chance I can stay another night?

Mother: What about your responsibilities?

Me: Can my siblings feed the dogs?

Mother: Don't you think they do enough for you? They filled up their bowls, watered them and picked up after them. They also did the dishes and the washing. Don't you think we do enough for you?

Me: I'll come home later then 

Mother: You don't get to call the shots, I don't like how you keep forgetting about your family. Tell your friend that you are not to hang out with them until you get your priorities straight. Your Nan is on her last 2 legs and all you think about is yourself, you're gonna regret this later in life. 

Me: I already thought about all that stuff, I just thought I'd ask

Mother: Don't put more stress on me then, stop pushing boundaries like a child, you want me to treat you like a young adult? Act like it. 

I feel like some of this is unfair but I also want to take responsibility for the parts where I am wrong.

Recently, I (16F) began talking to this teacher (33M) at my school. We’ve known each other for 2 years but we recently started talking due to our one on one lessons, he started talking about a video game that he played and even told me he and his fiancé hosted many events where many people would get together and play.

I ended up googling the game when I got home, it didn’t seem very interesting but I decided to try and learn more since I wanted to get out of my comfort zone. All I really played were gothic horror video games, I looked into the game further and decided it seemed alright.

I joined a chatroom and coincidentally noticed my teacher was there because he was using his first and last name to advertise the event. I thought it might be weird if I say something, but I genuinely wanted to learn a little more so my plan was just to quickly pass by and spectate others playing then leave.

136,1dasreu,AITA for fight with maternal grandmother,"I have to know, AITA for this. I was invited to my son’s(18mth) mother’s house for dinner tonight. We’ve been split for about a month but are keeping things cool for our son. I appreciate things like this. She invited her mom without my knowledge. It is her house, she can invite whomever she wants. I get that. I have been very open with her about how I feel about her mother. I can’t stand her, but I do tolerate her the best of my ability(which was overwhelmed in this episode) out of respect. 

Here’s what happened. I mentioned above why I was there. My son and I were outside playing in her backyard and she asked if her and her mother could go on a drive. I said “of course, have fun!”. They left and my son and I hung out until it started raining and we came inside. My son and I went out to my truck and I grabbed my lunchbox full of snacks and placed them on the dining room table. I gave him his snacks and I ate mine together waiting on them to come back. She came inside to find my son and I playing. Then, I saw her mother walk in. I told my son “say hi to grams!(her nickname)”. All was good. I noticed my son had a bunch of dirt and snot on his upper lip so we went back to his room to grab wipes and clean him up for dinner. 

This is when it got bad. I was carrying my son back into the kitchen/dining room after cleaning him up and I immediately noticed grams has taken my lunchboxes off of the table and placed them on the ground so she could sit at the dining table. I will mention that there is a couch, other chairs, etc to sit at. There was also enough room for her to push it a little out of the way to make room for her. I immediately pointed at my stuff and asked “what is this!?” She said “making room on the table for dinner”… burgers aren’t even on the grill yet. They have been back for less than 5 minutes. I asked “why couldn’t you have asked me to move it for you” she says “you weren’t in here and I needed room”… I went the fuck off y’all. I told her how wrong she was for doing that and both mom and grandma both got pissed at me about getting mad about it. I refused to back down and thought it was very disrespectful for taking someone’s belongings off of a table and putting them on the floor for their own convenience. I was planning to clear the table for us to eat when I got back with my son and this changed everything. I went off so bad on her telling her how much of a pos she was to me and she was firing back saying how I was wrong for getting this upset. It was nasty. She tried to leave and I said “it’s not my house, I’ll leave” and then my son was chasing me down and crying after all the commotion. It was bad. I have never gotten mad around my son much less at all about anything in a long time. I am usually the calm and collected one, but this one did me in.

I have never gotten mad around my son much less at all about anything in a long time. I am usually the calm and collected one, but this one did me in. 

AITA? I’ll take whatever I get. I do agree I overreacted in the situation, but when it was treated as normal, I couldn’t hold it together anymore. ",1.0,0.12750592827796936,0,0
