0,1dbj4wr,AITA for banning my daughter from going to her best friends house?,"My daughter and her best friend, Will, have been friends since they were 5 and I let her sleep over at his house sometimes. They're 13.

Her best friend is a really sweet boy and I love their dynamic. I think the both of them are adorable, but I don't think I can continue letting her go to his house.

This is so insane, but my daughter fell and broke her arm while at their house. Accidents happen, so I would have been understanding if his mom called me. But she didn't. I had no idea about it until my daughter came home, the next day. She didn't have a phone because hers was broken and I didn't get around to buying her a new one yet because we've had a lot of expensives. So I trusted her parents would call me if their was an issue.

But no, she spent the night at their house and then WALKED HOME with her best friend. So his parents didn't even WALK HER HOME WHILE HER ARM WAS BROKEN.

The most insane part of this all is that her mom is a nurse, so there isn't any excuse. I told her that I find it really messed up that she didn't tell me and it turned into a whole argument. She said my daughter seemed fine and she was playing afterwards and she was too exhausted to take her to the hospital. She said she knew I would make a big deal out of nothing so she thought it could wait.

I insulted her, if I'm honest. I said she was a terrible parent and treated my daughter terribly. She let her walk home alone (well with a child, but a parent should have been with her) and she should have called me the second my daughter was hurt. She insulted me back and it was a whole mess.

I told my daughter and my son that they can't go over to that house anymore because that kids parents are clearly insane. My daughter is especially sad about this because that is her best friend, but I do think it is for the best. I do not feel comfortable leaving them alone together.

1,1dbj37j,AITA for getting mad at my friend for not wanting to hangout,"New account since I've never made a reddit post before. About a year ago my friend at the time lets call her Liv (18F) and Myself (18M) Where very close friends and would hangout about once a week if not twice a week and constantly text, however she also has a group of friends that she is also close with, around 12 people if I had to guess, and we all went to the same highschool so I knew them but we weren't super close. But they would constantly do group hangout events and parties. At first I didn't think anything of it especially since it was her other friends that were planning the events and I didn't want to intrude and figured they just didn't like me or something. However it was about to be Liv's birthday and I asked her what she was doing to celebrate and Liv said she was having a party. I asked when it was and she said that it was the day after on a Saturday so that all her friends could be there. I asked what time it was and she asked me why I wanted to know. I said ""so I know what time to be there lol."" She then said that I wasn't invited since it was primarily going to be her friend group. This really hurt but I figured it was her birthday and that she can celebrate however she wanted. Regardless I still got her a gift and dropped it off at her house (nothing crazy just like one of those weird banners you see on Amazon). I kinda forgot about it and moved on since we were still talking all the time and seeing each other about once a week. However once our senior year of highschool ended she started to hangout less and talk to me more. So I asked her what was going on to make sure she was okay and she just said she was fine. About 2 weeks later she just stopped hanging out with me altogether but would still text me. A little later in the week my uncle passed away and then the week after that my grandma also passed away. I sent her a message saying that I wasn't doing great and I needed someone to hangout with and she said that she wasn't really up to hanging out. This really hurt me and so I sent a really long message about how she is my best friend and that her friendship means so much to me but that she had been really pushing me and making it difficult to stay friends with her. She then responded saying that she was busy doing stuff with her other friends before they moved away to college. Which to be fair I was going to my local community college so I was staying in town. But this made me feel like some sort of a backup and not really valued. I tried telling her that I totally get that but that she's basically ignoring me. She then said that I was being overly dramatic and that I'm making too much of a big deal. Fast forward a few weeks I asked her what she was doing for the weekend and she said she was just staying home and not doing anything and needed a break from socializing. I then got a invitation to go to a party from someone in Liv's friend group, let's call her Kay(18F) and I decided to go. when I showed up Kay walked up to me and greeted me with a hug. At this point I figured she didn't like me since Liv made it a point not to invite me to events with her and Liv's other friends there. I said hello and made some small talk and looked around to see who is there and wouldn't you know it I saw Liv there. I was immediately confused and started to walk over to her, she saw me coming and immediately got off of the couch she was sitting on and went to the bathroom. This started to make me mad. Once she got out of the bathroom I started to walk up to her again and she went the opposite direction. I tried to do this a few times and she kept walking away from me. So I decided to leave early.

2,1dbikjk,WIBTA if I asked my fiancé not to go back to his old job after his boss fat shamed me?,"Here's some background: Me and my fiancé were long distance for 5 years. We'd always visit each other during holidays and summer break. For the last 2 years of our long distance, when I visited him in the summer, we'd both work at the local ice cream parlor. The first summer I worked there, the owners were super nice to me. They always forgave my mistakes and showed kindness. Because I had such a great time working there, I decided to go back the next year. I was surprised when their whole demeanor towards me changed. They no longer forgave my mistakes and never complimented my work. They even decreased my already low pay without telling me. I decided to just get through the summer since I would be starting college and would not return to work there again. At the end of that summer, I got them a 'thank you' card and they never said thank you or even seemed appreciative. 

Fast forward to the next summer (this summer). My fiancé has moved in with me while I complete college, so he is not working there this year. We visited his family in May and stopped by the ice cream parlor. We went into the back to talk to the owners, just to catch up. All they said was ""hi"" to me and then started a long conversation with my fiancé without ever paying attention to me. Because I felt awkward standing there, I decided to go to the front and take a seat with our food. A couple minutes later, one of the owners comes out and starts washing tables around me. When she walks past me, she stops and asks, ""you're eating a pizza and chicken tenders?"" with a bit of disgust on her face. I laugh it off and say that I missed their food while I was away and she just walks away. I have told this story to a couple family members and they've all said that this was a form of fat shaming.

My fiancé has never had a problem with them. He actually loves working there and wants to go back when we move to his state. It is a very fun working environment when the owners aren't there, so I understand where he is coming from, but I told him that it makes me uncomfortable that he'd work for people that would say something like that to me. He got kind of annoyed and told me that it was up to me if he works there or not.

3,1dbihc9,AITA for not calling my mom while she was in the hospital?,"In the last couple years, I graduated from college with a bachelor's and master's degree, got my first salaried job, and bought a house. My life has been extremely hectic and I have not done a good job of staying in touch with family and friends. 

She lives in a city a couple hours away from me with my grandparents, and has a long history of both physical and mental illness, so hospital stays are common. My mom was admitted to the hospital yesterday for an annoying but non-serious (and gross, so won't say exactly what) illness. My mom has Bipolar Disorder and is always either manic or depressed. Apparently, she is in a depressed state right now. 

Some important backstory is that my dad divorced my mom when I was seven. I have one older brother who is 9 years older than me, and he understandably escaped the toxic household as soon as he could and removed himself from both my dad and mom's lives. I however was stuck there, and my mom used me as an emotional crutch my whole life and became emotionally codependant on me. Since I have been living on my own, I have been trying to set boundaries, but my mom has not received this well. 

When she was admitted to the hospital yesterday, I was worried but her condition was good and the treatment was simple and clear (it was actually something I dealt with as a child, so I knew she would be fine). With past hospitilizations, I have been much more active in speaking with her and visiting her, because those were much more serious and some have been life-threatening. This instance however was not, so I did not worry and honesty didn't even think to call her. She called me today and told me she was upset I did not call her, and that she expected my older brother not to call, but that she did not expect this from me. She even said ""I feel like I don't know you anymore."" Guilttripping is a staple of hers, but those words stung because I always do my  best. My job is incredibly emotionally taxing and I feel like my brain is about to explode with the emotions of others all day, every day.

She asked to see, and since I hadn't really made any previous posts, I showed her. For context, this reddit account that I'm posting on is not the same one I showed her. She saw my user and got super pissed and went quiet.

Obviously, I asked her what was wrong, and apparently, I commented on a post she'd made a few years ago in this subreddit and called her an ahole. 

Why she remembered this, I have no idea. I don't even know which post she's talking about, but she's super mad about it, and she won't talk to me. My brother thinks this is hilarious, and won't stop teasing me about this. 

It's a little funny, but kind of stressing me out. AITA?",0.0,1.0379127,1,0

10,1dbh4xg,AITA for asking for medical help in front of my parents even though they told me nothing was wrong?,"\[Translated, I don't speak English\]

I'm 24F, Peruvian, I live with my parents (Here they become independent at 28.)  
  
I have allergic asthma from birth, just like my father. My attacks have always been short and go away with the periodic use of salbutamol but it gets worse in the cold.

In my area there is a strong frost. Yesterday I had one of those asthmatic attacks, I tried to take medication as usual, but nothing worked. Although I've had asthma for years, the last time I had to go to the hospital for it was when I was 12, and even then it wasn't as bad as it was yesterday.  
  
My parents take me to the ER because I couldn't breathe enough to speak, my heart was beating quite fast, and I suddenly felt the sensation of dying (I had never felt that in my life before, not even in previous attacks).

I was so afraid of dying that I screamed ""help"" and ""I can't breathe"" during the transfer, to which my parents scolded me saying that I wasn't going to die and that I was being overdramatic.

When they started to nebulize me, the doctor said that they would have to nebulize me three times in a period of 20 minutes each. Neither my parents nor I wanted to be there for so long, but we had no other option. My heart was already beating fast during the transfer to the ER, but at the second nebulization my body began to shake.  
  
I asked my father if it was normal, and he told me yes and that nothing was wrong, that they should give me the third round so they can discharge me. It didn't seem normal to me since I saw that my heart rate was 130 at rest and I was shaking a little.  
  
When the nurse came to connect me, I told her that I was shaking and that my heart was beating quite fast, to which my parents saw me in quite a bad way and, once the nurse left, they scolded me saying that I was being childish, that nothing was wrong. and why the hell was he calling the doctor for something stupid.  
  
When the doctor arrived he told me that I had tachycardia and that it was the side effect of Salbutamol, that they would stop it for an hour until my heart rate returned to normal and thus I can complete the treatment. As soon as he left, my dad started telling me that I shouldn't be scared in this type of situation because I was too old for this nonsense, and that I should stop acting like a little girl because I was throwing a tantrum over something that was normal. I told him to leave and that I could go alone when I was discharged, to which he sent me to hell and he stayed in the ER.  
  
And this is what makes me think I might be the asshole: My mother told my father to scold me because ""I think I did something good."" I honestly don't know what I did wrong, but my parents' attitude confuses me.  
  
In the end they discharged me, my parents never apologized but I still wonder if I was right to ask for medical help in the ER for something ""unnecessary"" (It doesn't seem unnecessary to me, but I don't know if I was really exaggerating without knowing it.)",Not the A-hole,2024-06-09,"AITA for asking for medical help in front of my parents even though they told me nothing was wrong? \[Translated, I don't speak English\]

13,1dbgptt,AITA for calling my brother selfish for his renting behavior? ,"I (25M) have two brothers, Kevin (23M) and Matt (18M). Kevin has been living with his girlfriend for a few years, and soon the three of them will be moving into a 2-bedroom apartment. 

Kevin doesn’t really want Matt living with him, but all our family agrees that Matt really needs to move out of the house to start growing and developing more. He’s been out of high school for over a year now and he hasn’t really done much to start his adult life. He tried college last fall but wasn’t ready for it, and dropped out; he also hasn’t worked a lot either. 

Kevin and his girlfriend are uni students. When Matt moves in, he’s going to take a job Kevin lined up for him and hopefully try community college again. Tbh much of the family is not very optimistic about him succeeding this time around either—with college or the job. Because of this, Matt’s not going to be a tenant on the lease; if he can’t make rent or is a bad enough roommate, Kevin wants to be able to evict him without much hassle. 

This much I can kinda understand. But in addition to not allowing Matt tenant rights on the lease, Kevin is forcing Matt to pay rent 50/50. That is, Kevin (who is quite well-off financially) and his girlfriend will pay 25% each, and Matt—who is living on his own for the first time, in a brand-new city—is expected to pay 50%. I’ve lived in a 3-person, 2-room situation before, and my understanding is that it’s common etiquette to split everything in thirds. I’d offer that to a stranger, and certainly to my own brother. 

When I raised concerns about this to Kevin, he said he doubted Matt would be able to make rent no matter what it was. And that if Matt had trouble making rent, he could pull from his education savings to meet the rent (we’re fortunate enough to have parents who could build college savings accounts for us growing up). 

Am I the asshole for making a stink about this to my family? It seems like Kevin is trying to indirectly steal from Matt’s college savings, and is setting him up for failure when he’s already struggling to get his life going. My parents seem ambivalent about it right now, and aren’t really pushing for Kevin to do things in a more equitable way.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who has responded. I thought there was little I could do about this, but many comments have suggested that I take more direct action in helping Matt out (either with finances or resources)—I plan to get more involved in the situation to help him out, rather than complain without a horse in the race. 

Some clarifications because many responses have talked about this: 
—This is, to my knowledge, an idea Kevin proposed of his own volition without being asked to. Matt is not being forced upon him, this is Kevin’s attempt to help him out. I admire that Kevin is willing to lend a hand and don’t want to discredit that—it’s brave to step up and take someone in!—but my problem is that this dynamic seems to be more destructive than constructive.
—It’s important to consider that Kevin is expecting 50% payment without giving Matt ANY legal rights of residency. This not only doesn’t account for shared apartment space/amenities, but keeps Matt a second-class citizen who is expected to hold the same responsibilities without any agency over his living space. I could understand keeping him off the lease if he had a minority stake in the apartment, but currently it seems Kevin wants to have his cake and eat it too.

14,1dbgnr9,AITA For my comment regarding a snack?,"AITA for my comment about having a snack?

Today, my gf (25) and I (26M) were sitting down and she began to complain about how our house has no snacks. She makes this complaint a lot but she will actively not buy snacks when we’re at the store. This is because I, as a general rule, do not tend to snack because of my really poor impulse control with snacking, which caused me to gain a lot of weight. It’s not that I can’t have snacks in the house - and sometimes I do buy them just to have that option available, but I don’t really snack on them myself because I have a hard time stopping (for context, I do have an ADHD diagnosis).

The problem is that she also gets upset at me for my eating habits - her parents and her roll their eyes when I go out to a restaurant and order salmon on a salad or do grilled teriyaki chicken with white rice instead of fried rice due to all the oil and butter. I supposedly “make everybody feel bad”. That’s not at all my intention, but I struggled with my weight as a child and I slowly have watched my parents health decline as a result of theirs.

So today I just made a comment that I know I probably shouldn’t have with regard to her complaining that we had no snacks. It was an hour til dinner so I said “Dinner is in an hour, shouldn’t we just wait?” I’ll admit, my tone was a little off - I’m thinking that the complaining kind of got on my nerves as I was having a difficult day dealing with some of my classmates. She then got super upset and asked how the fuck could I be inconsiderate because she did some volunteer physical labor that I chose not to do that day (because I had some car problems I was working on instead). It apparently made her “feel like a fatass” and I immediately apologized because that was not my intention and I simply thought that the timing of the snack was why I said that. She then said I’m being unfair because I’m “always the one to get us nachos” or suggest “frozen yogurt”. Basically she’s saying that I’m limiting her snacking only to times when I also want it. But any other time we’ve gone out I’ve never once told her off from ordering her own appetizers or desserts, so I clearly can’t be limiting her because she still gets them. I didn’t mention that point because she was very upset but I think it’s unfair that she tells our friends these things because I’m not at all a controlling person. She was silent with me for a while after this. Then when we were at dinner, her dad suggested ice cream and my gf said she couldn’t because she’s too fat. She also took a smaller helping for her sides because, again, she’s “too fat”. I’m on Reddit to get a second opinion from y’all, because I do think I should not have said what I said.

15,1dbgn3v,AITA for not feeling attracted to my partner after being let down so much?,"
Putting all my feelings down will probably be hard but I don't know how to move forward with my situation so it looks like I’m going to need to.
My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months. In the beginning, I was so in love and couldn't spend a minute away from him; every touch felt magical for about 5 months.

After that time, he started to get too comfortable. He didn't prioritize me like he used to because it seemed he realized I wouldn't leave him over small stuff. He would say he's on his way and then not leave his house for another 50 minutes and still need to drive 40 minutes to my place. He started lying about small things, didn’t bring me flowers, or plan dates anymore (I just wanted simple things like coffee dates or picnics). Every time he was supposed to sleep over, his mum would always order him home for something trivial. I thought it was a bad phase and was willing to ride it out.

I want a man ""to protect me from society""—I’m capable of doing it myself, but hearing from him 'I appreciate it if you wouldn't wear that, it's not your style' would be nice. I communicated this but he didn’t do it and didn’t seem to care. He never asked about my male friends and colleagues without knowing anything about them. This lack of jealousy and his loss in pursuing me, breaking promises, went on for weeks. I talked with him, told him it wouldn’t go on like that. He changed for a day, then the same behavior for a month. I was ready to end it but still loved him, so his empty promises made me stay.

One month ago, I was at my last straw. Telling him how he doesn't think about me made him so different, and I started seeing him as ""weak"" and not dominant. I felt bad and guilty for seeing him this way. He started working on his behavior but still, I don’t feel like he could take care of me when he can't make doctor's appointments for himself despite serious health problems. I want him to be a strong, independent man but don’t see him like that.

Still, I think if he manages to change, appreciate me, and keep his promises, there’s hope for him. But for the past 3 weeks, I don’t feel attracted to him. I hate myself for this because I remember how magical his touch was. When he kisses me, I feel a little disgusted and get annoyed by his warm saliva.

Our sex life has major problems. I don’t feel disgusted doing things to him and it’s still fun, but as soon as he touches me, I feel nothing and don't get aroused. Our sex life is non-existent and I feel it’s my fault. I don’t know if this is just a phase and normal or a sign that there's nothing to rescue. I really love him but lately, I think there's no thought behind that man and his brain is empty. Everything you want to happen, you almost have to do it yourself because he’ll say he thought about it but forgot. The basics are perfect now but what if there’s no hope with no thought or intentions behind his face? Even though this all sounds mean, I love him so much and it would hurt so much to lose him.

I want a man ""to protect me from society""—I’m capable of doing it myself, but hearing from him 'I appreciate it if you wouldn't wear that, it's not your style' would be nice. I communicated this but he didn’t do it and didn’t seem to care. He never asked about my male friends and colleagues without knowing anything about them. This lack of jealousy and his loss in pursuing me, breaking promises, went on for weeks. I talked with him, told him it wouldn’t go on like that. He changed for a day, then the same behavior for a month. I was ready to end it but still loved him, so his empty promises made me stay.

One month ago, I was at my last straw. Telling him how he doesn't think about me made him so different, and I started seeing him as ""weak"" and not dominant. I felt bad and guilty for seeing him this way. He started working on his behavior but still, I don’t feel like he could take care of me when he can't make doctor's appointments for himself despite serious health problems. I want him to be a strong, independent man but don’t see him like that.

Still, I think if he manages to change, appreciate me, and keep his promises, there’s hope for him. But for the past 3 weeks, I don’t feel attracted to him. I hate myself for this because I remember how magical his touch was. When he kisses me, I feel a little disgusted and get annoyed by his warm saliva.

Our sex life has major problems. I don’t feel disgusted doing things to him and it’s still fun, but as soon as he touches me, I feel nothing and don't get aroused. Our sex life is non-existent and I feel it’s my fault. I don’t know if this is just a phase and normal or a sign that there's nothing to rescue. I really love him but lately, I think there's no thought behind that man and his brain is empty. Everything you want to happen, you almost have to do it yourself because he’ll say he thought about it but forgot. The basics are perfect now but what if there’s no hope with no thought or intentions behind his face? Even though this all sounds mean, I love him so much and it would hurt so much to lose him.
