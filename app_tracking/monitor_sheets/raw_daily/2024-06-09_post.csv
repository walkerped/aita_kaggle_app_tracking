0,1dbj4wr,AITA for banning my daughter from going to her best friends house?,"My daughter and her best friend, Will, have been friends since they were 5 and I let her sleep over at his house sometimes. They're 13.

Her best friend is a really sweet boy and I love their dynamic. I think the both of them are adorable, but I don't think I can continue letting her go to his house.

This is so insane, but my daughter fell and broke her arm while at their house. Accidents happen, so I would have been understanding if his mom called me. But she didn't. I had no idea about it until my daughter came home, the next day. She didn't have a phone because hers was broken and I didn't get around to buying her a new one yet because we've had a lot of expensives. So I trusted her parents would call me if their was an issue.

But no, she spent the night at their house and then WALKED HOME with her best friend. So his parents didn't even WALK HER HOME WHILE HER ARM WAS BROKEN.

The most insane part of this all is that her mom is a nurse, so there isn't any excuse. I told her that I find it really messed up that she didn't tell me and it turned into a whole argument. She said my daughter seemed fine and she was playing afterwards and she was too exhausted to take her to the hospital. She said she knew I would make a big deal out of nothing so she thought it could wait.

I insulted her, if I'm honest. I said she was a terrible parent and treated my daughter terribly. She let her walk home alone (well with a child, but a parent should have been with her) and she should have called me the second my daughter was hurt. She insulted me back and it was a whole mess.

I told my daughter and my son that they can't go over to that house anymore because that kids parents are clearly insane. My daughter is especially sad about this because that is her best friend, but I do think it is for the best. I do not feel comfortable leaving them alone together.

1,1dbj37j,AITA for getting mad at my friend for not wanting to hangout,"New account since I've never made a reddit post before. About a year ago my friend at the time lets call her Liv (18F) and Myself (18M) Where very close friends and would hangout about once a week if not twice a week and constantly text, however she also has a group of friends that she is also close with, around 12 people if I had to guess, and we all went to the same highschool so I knew them but we weren't super close. But they would constantly do group hangout events and parties. At first I didn't think anything of it especially since it was her other friends that were planning the events and I didn't want to intrude and figured they just didn't like me or something. However it was about to be Liv's birthday and I asked her what she was doing to celebrate and Liv said she was having a party. I asked when it was and she said that it was the day after on a Saturday so that all her friends could be there. I asked what time it was and she asked me why I wanted to know. I said ""so I know what time to be there lol."" She then said that I wasn't invited since it was primarily going to be her friend group. This really hurt but I figured it was her birthday and that she can celebrate however she wanted. Regardless I still got her a gift and dropped it off at her house (nothing crazy just like one of those weird banners you see on Amazon). I kinda forgot about it and moved on since we were still talking all the time and seeing each other about once a week. However once our senior year of highschool ended she started to hangout less and talk to me more. So I asked her what was going on to make sure she was okay and she just said she was fine. About 2 weeks later she just stopped hanging out with me altogether but would still text me. A little later in the week my uncle passed away and then the week after that my grandma also passed away. I sent her a message saying that I wasn't doing great and I needed someone to hangout with and she said that she wasn't really up to hanging out. This really hurt me and so I sent a really long message about how she is my best friend and that her friendship means so much to me but that she had been really pushing me and making it difficult to stay friends with her. She then responded saying that she was busy doing stuff with her other friends before they moved away to college. Which to be fair I was going to my local community college so I was staying in town. But this made me feel like some sort of a backup and not really valued. I tried telling her that I totally get that but that she's basically ignoring me. She then said that I was being overly dramatic and that I'm making too much of a big deal. Fast forward a few weeks I asked her what she was doing for the weekend and she said she was just staying home and not doing anything and needed a break from socializing. I then got a invitation to go to a party from someone in Liv's friend group, let's call her Kay(18F) and I decided to go. when I showed up Kay walked up to me and greeted me with a hug. At this point I figured she didn't like me since Liv made it a point not to invite me to events with her and Liv's other friends there. I said hello and made some small talk and looked around to see who is there and wouldn't you know it I saw Liv there. I was immediately confused and started to walk over to her, she saw me coming and immediately got off of the couch she was sitting on and went to the bathroom. This started to make me mad. Once she got out of the bathroom I started to walk up to her again and she went the opposite direction. I tried to do this a few times and she kept walking away from me. So I decided to leave early.

2,1dbikjk,WIBTA if I asked my fiancé not to go back to his old job after his boss fat shamed me?,"Here's some background: Me and my fiancé were long distance for 5 years. We'd always visit each other during holidays and summer break. For the last 2 years of our long distance, when I visited him in the summer, we'd both work at the local ice cream parlor. The first summer I worked there, the owners were super nice to me. They always forgave my mistakes and showed kindness. Because I had such a great time working there, I decided to go back the next year. I was surprised when their whole demeanor towards me changed. They no longer forgave my mistakes and never complimented my work. They even decreased my already low pay without telling me. I decided to just get through the summer since I would be starting college and would not return to work there again. At the end of that summer, I got them a 'thank you' card and they never said thank you or even seemed appreciative. 

Fast forward to the next summer (this summer). My fiancé has moved in with me while I complete college, so he is not working there this year. We visited his family in May and stopped by the ice cream parlor. We went into the back to talk to the owners, just to catch up. All they said was ""hi"" to me and then started a long conversation with my fiancé without ever paying attention to me. Because I felt awkward standing there, I decided to go to the front and take a seat with our food. A couple minutes later, one of the owners comes out and starts washing tables around me. When she walks past me, she stops and asks, ""you're eating a pizza and chicken tenders?"" with a bit of disgust on her face. I laugh it off and say that I missed their food while I was away and she just walks away. I have told this story to a couple family members and they've all said that this was a form of fat shaming.

My fiancé has never had a problem with them. He actually loves working there and wants to go back when we move to his state. It is a very fun working environment when the owners aren't there, so I understand where he is coming from, but I told him that it makes me uncomfortable that he'd work for people that would say something like that to me. He got kind of annoyed and told me that it was up to me if he works there or not.

3,1dbihc9,AITA for not calling my mom while she was in the hospital?,"In the last couple years, I graduated from college with a bachelor's and master's degree, got my first salaried job, and bought a house. My life has been extremely hectic and I have not done a good job of staying in touch with family and friends. 

She lives in a city a couple hours away from me with my grandparents, and has a long history of both physical and mental illness, so hospital stays are common. My mom was admitted to the hospital yesterday for an annoying but non-serious (and gross, so won't say exactly what) illness. My mom has Bipolar Disorder and is always either manic or depressed. Apparently, she is in a depressed state right now. 

Some important backstory is that my dad divorced my mom when I was seven. I have one older brother who is 9 years older than me, and he understandably escaped the toxic household as soon as he could and removed himself from both my dad and mom's lives. I however was stuck there, and my mom used me as an emotional crutch my whole life and became emotionally codependant on me. Since I have been living on my own, I have been trying to set boundaries, but my mom has not received this well. 

When she was admitted to the hospital yesterday, I was worried but her condition was good and the treatment was simple and clear (it was actually something I dealt with as a child, so I knew she would be fine). With past hospitilizations, I have been much more active in speaking with her and visiting her, because those were much more serious and some have been life-threatening. This instance however was not, so I did not worry and honesty didn't even think to call her. She called me today and told me she was upset I did not call her, and that she expected my older brother not to call, but that she did not expect this from me. She even said ""I feel like I don't know you anymore."" Guilttripping is a staple of hers, but those words stung because I always do my  best. My job is incredibly emotionally taxing and I feel like my brain is about to explode with the emotions of others all day, every day.

She asked to see, and since I hadn't really made any previous posts, I showed her. For context, this reddit account that I'm posting on is not the same one I showed her. She saw my user and got super pissed and went quiet.

Obviously, I asked her what was wrong, and apparently, I commented on a post she'd made a few years ago in this subreddit and called her an ahole. 

Why she remembered this, I have no idea. I don't even know which post she's talking about, but she's super mad about it, and she won't talk to me. My brother thinks this is hilarious, and won't stop teasing me about this. 

It's a little funny, but kind of stressing me out. AITA?",0.0,1.0379127,1,0

10,1dbh4xg,AITA for asking for medical help in front of my parents even though they told me nothing was wrong?,"\[Translated, I don't speak English\]

I'm 24F, Peruvian, I live with my parents (Here they become independent at 28.)  
  
I have allergic asthma from birth, just like my father. My attacks have always been short and go away with the periodic use of salbutamol but it gets worse in the cold.

In my area there is a strong frost. Yesterday I had one of those asthmatic attacks, I tried to take medication as usual, but nothing worked. Although I've had asthma for years, the last time I had to go to the hospital for it was when I was 12, and even then it wasn't as bad as it was yesterday.  
  
My parents take me to the ER because I couldn't breathe enough to speak, my heart was beating quite fast, and I suddenly felt the sensation of dying (I had never felt that in my life before, not even in previous attacks).

I was so afraid of dying that I screamed ""help"" and ""I can't breathe"" during the transfer, to which my parents scolded me saying that I wasn't going to die and that I was being overdramatic.

When they started to nebulize me, the doctor said that they would have to nebulize me three times in a period of 20 minutes each. Neither my parents nor I wanted to be there for so long, but we had no other option. My heart was already beating fast during the transfer to the ER, but at the second nebulization my body began to shake.  
  
I asked my father if it was normal, and he told me yes and that nothing was wrong, that they should give me the third round so they can discharge me. It didn't seem normal to me since I saw that my heart rate was 130 at rest and I was shaking a little.  
  
When the nurse came to connect me, I told her that I was shaking and that my heart was beating quite fast, to which my parents saw me in quite a bad way and, once the nurse left, they scolded me saying that I was being childish, that nothing was wrong. and why the hell was he calling the doctor for something stupid.  
  
When the doctor arrived he told me that I had tachycardia and that it was the side effect of Salbutamol, that they would stop it for an hour until my heart rate returned to normal and thus I can complete the treatment. As soon as he left, my dad started telling me that I shouldn't be scared in this type of situation because I was too old for this nonsense, and that I should stop acting like a little girl because I was throwing a tantrum over something that was normal. I told him to leave and that I could go alone when I was discharged, to which he sent me to hell and he stayed in the ER.  
  
And this is what makes me think I might be the asshole: My mother told my father to scold me because ""I think I did something good."" I honestly don't know what I did wrong, but my parents' attitude confuses me.  
  
In the end they discharged me, my parents never apologized but I still wonder if I was right to ask for medical help in the ER for something ""unnecessary"" (It doesn't seem unnecessary to me, but I don't know if I was really exaggerating without knowing it.)",Not the A-hole,2024-06-09,"AITA for asking for medical help in front of my parents even though they told me nothing was wrong? \[Translated, I don't speak English\]

13,1dbgptt,AITA for calling my brother selfish for his renting behavior? ,"I (25M) have two brothers, Kevin (23M) and Matt (18M). Kevin has been living with his girlfriend for a few years, and soon the three of them will be moving into a 2-bedroom apartment. 

Kevin doesn’t really want Matt living with him, but all our family agrees that Matt really needs to move out of the house to start growing and developing more. He’s been out of high school for over a year now and he hasn’t really done much to start his adult life. He tried college last fall but wasn’t ready for it, and dropped out; he also hasn’t worked a lot either. 

Kevin and his girlfriend are uni students. When Matt moves in, he’s going to take a job Kevin lined up for him and hopefully try community college again. Tbh much of the family is not very optimistic about him succeeding this time around either—with college or the job. Because of this, Matt’s not going to be a tenant on the lease; if he can’t make rent or is a bad enough roommate, Kevin wants to be able to evict him without much hassle. 

This much I can kinda understand. But in addition to not allowing Matt tenant rights on the lease, Kevin is forcing Matt to pay rent 50/50. That is, Kevin (who is quite well-off financially) and his girlfriend will pay 25% each, and Matt—who is living on his own for the first time, in a brand-new city—is expected to pay 50%. I’ve lived in a 3-person, 2-room situation before, and my understanding is that it’s common etiquette to split everything in thirds. I’d offer that to a stranger, and certainly to my own brother. 

When I raised concerns about this to Kevin, he said he doubted Matt would be able to make rent no matter what it was. And that if Matt had trouble making rent, he could pull from his education savings to meet the rent (we’re fortunate enough to have parents who could build college savings accounts for us growing up). 

Am I the asshole for making a stink about this to my family? It seems like Kevin is trying to indirectly steal from Matt’s college savings, and is setting him up for failure when he’s already struggling to get his life going. My parents seem ambivalent about it right now, and aren’t really pushing for Kevin to do things in a more equitable way.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who has responded. I thought there was little I could do about this, but many comments have suggested that I take more direct action in helping Matt out (either with finances or resources)—I plan to get more involved in the situation to help him out, rather than complain without a horse in the race. 

Some clarifications because many responses have talked about this: 
—This is, to my knowledge, an idea Kevin proposed of his own volition without being asked to. Matt is not being forced upon him, this is Kevin’s attempt to help him out. I admire that Kevin is willing to lend a hand and don’t want to discredit that—it’s brave to step up and take someone in!—but my problem is that this dynamic seems to be more destructive than constructive.
—It’s important to consider that Kevin is expecting 50% payment without giving Matt ANY legal rights of residency. This not only doesn’t account for shared apartment space/amenities, but keeps Matt a second-class citizen who is expected to hold the same responsibilities without any agency over his living space. I could understand keeping him off the lease if he had a minority stake in the apartment, but currently it seems Kevin wants to have his cake and eat it too.

14,1dbgnr9,AITA For my comment regarding a snack?,"AITA for my comment about having a snack?

Today, my gf (25) and I (26M) were sitting down and she began to complain about how our house has no snacks. She makes this complaint a lot but she will actively not buy snacks when we’re at the store. This is because I, as a general rule, do not tend to snack because of my really poor impulse control with snacking, which caused me to gain a lot of weight. It’s not that I can’t have snacks in the house - and sometimes I do buy them just to have that option available, but I don’t really snack on them myself because I have a hard time stopping (for context, I do have an ADHD diagnosis).

The problem is that she also gets upset at me for my eating habits - her parents and her roll their eyes when I go out to a restaurant and order salmon on a salad or do grilled teriyaki chicken with white rice instead of fried rice due to all the oil and butter. I supposedly “make everybody feel bad”. That’s not at all my intention, but I struggled with my weight as a child and I slowly have watched my parents health decline as a result of theirs.

So today I just made a comment that I know I probably shouldn’t have with regard to her complaining that we had no snacks. It was an hour til dinner so I said “Dinner is in an hour, shouldn’t we just wait?” I’ll admit, my tone was a little off - I’m thinking that the complaining kind of got on my nerves as I was having a difficult day dealing with some of my classmates. She then got super upset and asked how the fuck could I be inconsiderate because she did some volunteer physical labor that I chose not to do that day (because I had some car problems I was working on instead). It apparently made her “feel like a fatass” and I immediately apologized because that was not my intention and I simply thought that the timing of the snack was why I said that. She then said I’m being unfair because I’m “always the one to get us nachos” or suggest “frozen yogurt”. Basically she’s saying that I’m limiting her snacking only to times when I also want it. But any other time we’ve gone out I’ve never once told her off from ordering her own appetizers or desserts, so I clearly can’t be limiting her because she still gets them. I didn’t mention that point because she was very upset but I think it’s unfair that she tells our friends these things because I’m not at all a controlling person. She was silent with me for a while after this. Then when we were at dinner, her dad suggested ice cream and my gf said she couldn’t because she’s too fat. She also took a smaller helping for her sides because, again, she’s “too fat”. I’m on Reddit to get a second opinion from y’all, because I do think I should not have said what I said.

15,1dbgn3v,AITA for not feeling attracted to my partner after being let down so much?,"
Putting all my feelings down will probably be hard but I don't know how to move forward with my situation so it looks like I’m going to need to.
My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months. In the beginning, I was so in love and couldn't spend a minute away from him; every touch felt magical for about 5 months.

After that time, he started to get too comfortable. He didn't prioritize me like he used to because it seemed he realized I wouldn't leave him over small stuff. He would say he's on his way and then not leave his house for another 50 minutes and still need to drive 40 minutes to my place. He started lying about small things, didn’t bring me flowers, or plan dates anymore (I just wanted simple things like coffee dates or picnics). Every time he was supposed to sleep over, his mum would always order him home for something trivial. I thought it was a bad phase and was willing to ride it out.

I want a man ""to protect me from society""—I’m capable of doing it myself, but hearing from him 'I appreciate it if you wouldn't wear that, it's not your style' would be nice. I communicated this but he didn’t do it and didn’t seem to care. He never asked about my male friends and colleagues without knowing anything about them. This lack of jealousy and his loss in pursuing me, breaking promises, went on for weeks. I talked with him, told him it wouldn’t go on like that. He changed for a day, then the same behavior for a month. I was ready to end it but still loved him, so his empty promises made me stay.

One month ago, I was at my last straw. Telling him how he doesn't think about me made him so different, and I started seeing him as ""weak"" and not dominant. I felt bad and guilty for seeing him this way. He started working on his behavior but still, I don’t feel like he could take care of me when he can't make doctor's appointments for himself despite serious health problems. I want him to be a strong, independent man but don’t see him like that.

Still, I think if he manages to change, appreciate me, and keep his promises, there’s hope for him. But for the past 3 weeks, I don’t feel attracted to him. I hate myself for this because I remember how magical his touch was. When he kisses me, I feel a little disgusted and get annoyed by his warm saliva.

Our sex life has major problems. I don’t feel disgusted doing things to him and it’s still fun, but as soon as he touches me, I feel nothing and don't get aroused. Our sex life is non-existent and I feel it’s my fault. I don’t know if this is just a phase and normal or a sign that there's nothing to rescue. I really love him but lately, I think there's no thought behind that man and his brain is empty. Everything you want to happen, you almost have to do it yourself because he’ll say he thought about it but forgot. The basics are perfect now but what if there’s no hope with no thought or intentions behind his face? Even though this all sounds mean, I love him so much and it would hurt so much to lose him.

I want a man ""to protect me from society""—I’m capable of doing it myself, but hearing from him 'I appreciate it if you wouldn't wear that, it's not your style' would be nice. I communicated this but he didn’t do it and didn’t seem to care. He never asked about my male friends and colleagues without knowing anything about them. This lack of jealousy and his loss in pursuing me, breaking promises, went on for weeks. I talked with him, told him it wouldn’t go on like that. He changed for a day, then the same behavior for a month. I was ready to end it but still loved him, so his empty promises made me stay.

One month ago, I was at my last straw. Telling him how he doesn't think about me made him so different, and I started seeing him as ""weak"" and not dominant. I felt bad and guilty for seeing him this way. He started working on his behavior but still, I don’t feel like he could take care of me when he can't make doctor's appointments for himself despite serious health problems. I want him to be a strong, independent man but don’t see him like that.

Still, I think if he manages to change, appreciate me, and keep his promises, there’s hope for him. But for the past 3 weeks, I don’t feel attracted to him. I hate myself for this because I remember how magical his touch was. When he kisses me, I feel a little disgusted and get annoyed by his warm saliva.

Our sex life has major problems. I don’t feel disgusted doing things to him and it’s still fun, but as soon as he touches me, I feel nothing and don't get aroused. Our sex life is non-existent and I feel it’s my fault. I don’t know if this is just a phase and normal or a sign that there's nothing to rescue. I really love him but lately, I think there's no thought behind that man and his brain is empty. Everything you want to happen, you almost have to do it yourself because he’ll say he thought about it but forgot. The basics are perfect now but what if there’s no hope with no thought or intentions behind his face? Even though this all sounds mean, I love him so much and it would hurt so much to lose him.

16,1dc7zbj,WIBTA for not attending my nephew's birthday? ,"I(F) told my parents that I would not be attending my nephew's birthday in June a few weeks ago. I found out recently that my brother got upset that I would not be attending his son's 1st birthday and he said that he will never attend any of my future events. 

A bit of context: I moved out from my parents' home due to being unable to live with my Asian parents traditions and rules. I struggled with my mental health and left about 2 years ago to live with my friends about 5 hours away via driving. Last month, I moved cross country for work and found myself being unable to take time off due to the move to attend the birthday. 

These past two years have been struggle since my parents miss me dearly and ask me to move back home with them despite them having a full house with my siblings & SIL living there. I call my parents every week and visit 3 times a year. During this time, my brother & SIL gave birth to their son and I went to see my nephew already 3 times since his birth. 

My relationship with my brother has been rocky since I was a kid. Growing up in an Asian household, my brother has always been favored as the golden child since he was the only boy in our family. As a female, I was left to do all the chores in the home with my sister while he did not have to do anything. My brother has always been rude to us (name calling us dumb, stupid, and useless & gets really angry when things don't go his way) and has been called out by several family members for his rude behavior and attitude. Since I moved out, there's been a lot of tension since he feels that I should not have an attitude and be distance from my parents (but I'm doing this to keep my mental health sane). 

The 2nd to last visit home, my brother called me out for not attending/visiting during the birth of his son when I said I would try to take time off to do so. I did not attend due to work related events during that time. I understood that call out and it was well deserved, but living away from our parents mean that I can't always come to our parents' home. 

The last time I went home, I announced my move across country and said that I would try to attend my nephew's birthday. When I got to my location, I found myself unable to attend due to lack of PTO. So WIBTA for not attending my nephew's birthday?

17,1dc7p81,AITA for not loaning someone $35 for pizza?,"I was taught from a young age to not loan anyone money, unless you're okay with never seeing that money again... 

Last night I was relaxing after a difficult last few days, then started to get texts from an older male friend of mine that they need $35 for pizza, & that they haven't eaten in 2 days. By nature, I've always been bad for setting boundaries, but lately I've been putting my foot down. 

I started to question him as to where his money has gone from working,& why he couldn't ask another male friend, or even his own family. He said that his mom was too broke to send him $35, & his roommate had turned off his phone & had gone to Disneyland w/ his family, so he couldn't get ahold of him either. 
I then asked why he was coming to me, knowing that I'm currently on disability from work (not making any money at the moment whatsoever, just barely getting by using my savings) & he says that he's asked 3 people, including me, and nobody else has gotten back to him... 

He started guilt tripping me saying he hasn't eaten in 2 days and will send me $100 in return when he gets paid on Monday... 

I told him that I'm not in the position to lend any money, even if it's only $35 b/c I'm literally living penny to penny right now w/ huge medical bills to pay, & only having my savings left. 

He kept guilt tripping me so I turned my phone on silent & went about my night peacefully (b/c I'm already highly stressed as is, being a 25 y/o female that has had to move back in with my folks while I'm recovering in order to return to my job).

I passed out, woke up to 14 texts and 9 missed calls from him. Saying he's ""literally starving"", that his ""insides hurt because he's only eaten a tuna sandwich 2 days ago"", & then saying ""let me know when you've sent the money so I can order the pizza before they close at 3 am"". 

Meanwhile, all I've eaten myself in the last 3 days have been muffins & granola bars because that's all that I can afford for MYSELF! $35 isn't a lot, but when I'm not making any money right now b/c I can't work at the moment, it's a lot to me!

He ALMOST had me convinced last night that he truly was starving, but based on his past, and how he used to ask me for money all the time for drugs (which I accused him of first, but he said he has to do urine tests for his PO officer), it's incredibly hard for me to believe him.

18,1dc7olt,AITA for letting my bestfriend down when she is at her lowest ?,"Hi everyone , so recently i decided to take a break in my friendship with my bestfriend (i think that one day i might even put an end because i am just tired) 

I am going to give you some context so that you can understand better : 
I’ve met her like 3 years ago on the internet , we noticed that we got along really well , we talked like regular friends do for maybe idk , 6 months or so, she was struggling to respond to messages already but like we got a good friendship so i was okay with it , and then these last 2 yrs and a half she got into a relationship and she didn’t talked to me anymore , i was the only one initiating the conversations and she responded maybe 4 times a month when i was lucky and it was to seek some comfort when her relationship didn’t go well or that she had problems , she dropped all of her emotional burden and disappeared until the next time that she needed a shoulder to cry on .

The worst thing is that i didn’t felt used because it looks like she truly cared about me .

But i said that it hurted me that we didn’t talked as much as we used to do , she kept promising me that she was going to make an effort for me (responding to messages apparently makes her overwhelmed and anxious) and she never did ; not a single time , in 2 years and a half 

There was a lot of time that i was in emotional distress too to not say worse , and i went through hard moments and i kept calling her , sending her some messages and she never responded , i couldn’t get a single normal talk with her so i don’t know what i expected . 

I took all of her suffering multiple times when i was feeling at my lowest , and she never took a single moment to ask me how i was feeling back 

She is going thru the hardest time of her life since we knew each other , she broke up with her boyfriend and doesn’t have a home anymore (she is at her friend’s house until she can find a solution) and she is basically destroyed by her break up 

She has bpd so i feel really bad for leaving her knowing how her mental health is rough sometimes 

But i have sent her a message explaining all of this , and she responded by talking about the fact that i am giving up on her when she is at her lowest but she respects my decision 

Idk , am i selfish ?

Bringing the bird into the household was his decision with the understanding that he’d be the caretaker and he’s had it for 4 years. I was open to the bird but was firm on not wanting any additional responsibilities as I do the majority of the housework, cooking, cleaning, and caring for the dogs while also working full time. 

During this time, he has regularly neglected the bird to the point where I feel like I have a moral (and legal??) obligation to step in. He has ADHD and he is treated for it, but he forgets to care for the bird so often that I do about 75% of the caretaking and what he does do I often have to remind him. There are so many things that I KNOW need to happen for this bird to have a dignified quality of life and none of them are happening: his cage is often dirty, his toys are rarely rotated and often in disrepair, and the worst of it is that he regularly forgets to feed him. The feed and water should be checked/changed daily, and I oftentimes notice it’s been days without.

It looks like he went to change the food and got distracted halfway through so it was empty next to the cage. I immediately filled it and asked him what the fuck happened, and he said he forgot and apologized profusely. He “doesn’t know” when he removed the feeder.

25,1dc6rp4,WIBTA if i didn’t go to this wedding?,"My girlfriend and her brother got invited to be apart of a wedding by one of her relatives and she if I could come to it. Initially I said no because I don’t want to spend money buying a suit for a family event that has nothing to do with me. I don’t own one, and the way everything is so expensive now I can’t afford to even rent one. She told me that I wasn’t going to be apart of the wedding so I didn’t need one but just needed to dress nicely. I said “okay cool, then I’ll be there!” And left it at that. However, a problem (her brother) before the actual problem came in the picture. No idea why she felt the need to tell her brother my reason as to why I initially said no to going in the first place especially if I said I would come. They were talking to each other while I was in the bathroom drying off my hands but I overheard him calling me stupid, selfish, and too cheap for giving that “lame” excuse. I walked in the room and just death stared at the both of them then left while the brother was trying to apologize for his behavior. We’ve been friends for years but because he thinks its funny to talk down about me for no reason we’ve fallen off and this was just another case of that. Strike 1.

The actual problem arose when I got a call yesterday from my girlfriend telling me the dress code for the guests, and guess what…. The men need to wear suits. She was explaining that if I couldn’t go then she’d understand. I just sighed and told her I’ll make it happen but in the possible event that I don’t due to the amount of bills that I have to pay, then I apologize. Strike 2.

She calls again today, I was told the wedding is in the middle of next week so I should have enough time to come up with the money for a suit. I get paid this week on Wednesday so I told her that and she said “What do you mean? The wedding is in a few days on that specific day.” I’m confused now because its the beginning of a new week and was told its next week. Her reason is being that Sundays are considered part of last week and the actual start of a new week begins on Monday. I explained that it doesn’t work like that because if that was the case, Monday would be the very first day of every week on the calendar. She decides to call her brother and explain both of our logics and of course he agrees with her and starts to talk shit not knowing that I’m literally connected to the call. I told him “This is the second time I’ve heard you talking reckless about me over damn near nothing, either you or both of yall clearly have been doing this for some time but if I hear it again its gonna be issues.” That wasn’t the the main issue but its the fact that I’ve explained that money is tight, I have upcoming bills, and I literally said that I was going to need a suit. To add the cherry on top, her brother won’t shut the fuck up about me which has now created unnecessary tension between us. Strike 3

26,1dc6enl,AITA for not taking back pajamas my bf’s girl best friend wore?,"The past weekend my bf and I joined his friends for a weekend getaway at a cabin (Airbnb). There were five people in total (me, him, a male friend, his gf, and my bf's girl best friend). 

I've never liked his girl best friend because she gives pick me vibes and I think she either has a crush on my bf or she likes attention. She doesn't like me either. I remain very cordial to her. 

When we arrived at the cabin, she told my bf that she hadn't packed any pajamas and none of her clothes were appropriate since they'd get dirty. 

She couldn't wear the other girl's clothes because they wouldn't fit so she begged my bf to give me my pajamas since I always pack extra. Without asking me he gave her my pajamas.

So I came out of the shower to find her wearing my pajamas and with the bottom basically shoved all way up her crack. She spent the entire weekend lounging in my pjs. 

When the weekend was over she tried to give them back to me and I said that she could keep them. She got mad at me and asked if I thought she was dirty or had cooties. I said she could just keep them since it seemed she liked them a lot. She called me a mean girl and said I was being rude.

It ruined the mood since the other friend took her side while his girlfriend took mine and my bf had to take my side. And now things are really awkward and I think I might be iced out by my bf's friends. AITA?

Edit: He did not know I do not like her. I was annoyed at him for not asking but I always pack extra and never fussed about lending clothes to other people because I believe in hospitality. I would have offered her the pajamas. He immediately apologized and even bought me new pajamas.

27,1dc6dza,AITAH for not paying for my coworkers lunch? ,"This is genuinely the dumbest AITAH I’ve ever made/read, but here we are. I’m a first responder and was riding along with another shift for training purposes. The first day we drove through chic fil a. I ordered a small Mac And cheese, in our area that’s about $4. He ordered a whole meal. When we got to the window, they gave us 50% off making mine $2. The guy I was riding with said “Don’t worry I’ll cover you”. Cool, thank you for covering my $2 I appreciate it lol. Second day we went to a local bistro that’s decently pricey. I ordered a salad that was about $10. His meal totaled out to just over $20. When we went to the register to pay he told them “She’s going to cover mine” while pointing at me. To say I was appalled is an understatement. The cashier looked at me and I calmly stated “No, I will just be covering myself”. The guy I was riding with got mad and started saying he covered me for lunch yesterday so it’s only right that I cover him. I’m not confrontational, but I’m also no punk lol. I calmly stated “$2 does not constitute $22 (or whatever the total was). If you’d like me to give you $2 to cover my small side I ordered yesterday I will absolutely do that. But I will not be paying for your meal” and handed my card to the cashier. He paid for his meal and we went outside where he refused to let me get into the vehicle. He continued to argue and cause a scene in the parking lot. He told me I’m not longer allowed to ride with him, so I called for a supervisor. Once the supervisor arrived he told them that he covered my lunch yesterday and that I refused to extend the same courtesy and that I embarrassed him and caused a scene and he no longer feels comfortable riding with me. I explained my side to the supervisor and apologized because this is literally so ridiculous lol. The supervisor essentially said I was wrong because I should’ve just been respectful and paid for him like he did me. At this point I was pissed and told them this sounds like extortion and that I wasn’t going to be taken advantage of. I told them that $2 is a whole lot different than $22. We’re first responders, we don’t make a lot of money. I continued to say if he wanted me to buy him a drink from the gas station or give him $2 I had absolutely no problem doing so, but I was not going to be bullied into covering his meal because he covered mine. I ended up riding with someone else because obviously riding with him is no longer an option. The person I switched to also said I was wrong and should’ve just paid for his meal.

Around new year, we found out that she has cancer and after a month or so, the doctors gave her approximately two more years to live.

Our oldest child was nearby and overhead some of the conversation, so we told him that unfortunately, grandma will not survive the cancer and that she doesn't have much time left. Later, we also told our youngest. (We told them both in respectively age appropriate ways.)

Both kids were sad and cried, and the youngest called grandma in despair and told her that he didn't want her to die and that he was sad about it. She said ""well, we're all going to die some day. I'm a bit tired now, so I need to hang up"" and then she did.

29,1dc5x3k,WIBTA?  Feeling Excluded by Family WIBTA If I Said Something?,"WIBTA?

**This is a throwaway account and some names and details not distracting from the main story will be changed as some of the people referenced may or may not have Reddit accounts.**

Ok so I (40f) have been married to my husband (45m) for 15 years and I had a rocky start to meeting his family.  His mother had passed even before I met him but his sisters and father were very slow to warm up to me.  Regardless we persevered on and over the years I have become quite close to his sisters (or so I thought).  We would go out of our ways to regularly meet for lunch or dinner and I supported them the best I could when they were going through incredibly hard times within their marriages.

Two kids from one of my SIL went to the same college in a place that is very popular for vacations, and so when the first one was graduating, the entire family flew out and had a combo vacation/graduation party.  The second kid was supposed to graduate last December so we all once again made plans to go.  This is where I’ll share that I am a planner and my in laws are decidedly NOT.  It drives me crazy sometimes, especially when it comes to travel.  I like to plan so I can budget and pay off things and basically make the most out of whatever trip.  They procrastinate making actual plans or booking things until it’s literally last minute even if we’ve been talking about something for a year.  So, I booked our trip as soon as my sil gave us the dates.  Well, long story short, my niece didn’t end up graduating on time because she missed out on some classes or whatever.  We decided to go through with the trip anyways, since we would be out a lot of money if we didn’t just go.  No one else joined us but that is what it is.

Fast forward to this spring and I texted my SILs seeing if they wanted to grab a meal and come to find out, they were ALL (the entire side of the family 20+ people) there visiting!!!!  They didn’t even hint they going anywhere, let alone invite us.  I felt really left out and hurt.

Now, just the other day my SIL says there aren’t enough graduation tickets (my nephew was graduating high school) but there’s enough for just my husband.  So he goes, along with most of the family—everyone that is local at least) and then they went out to dinner (not near the graduation, actually near my house) and I wasn’t even invited to that.

**This is a throwaway account and some names and details not distracting from the main story will be changed as some of the people referenced may or may not have Reddit accounts.**

Ok so I (40f) have been married to my husband (45m) for 15 years and I had a rocky start to meeting his family.  His mother had passed even before I met him but his sisters and father were very slow to warm up to me.  Regardless we persevered on and over the years I have become quite close to his sisters (or so I thought).  We would go out of our ways to regularly meet for lunch or dinner and I supported them the best I could when they were going through incredibly hard times within their marriages.

Two kids from one of my SIL went to the same college in a place that is very popular for vacations, and so when the first one was graduating, the entire family flew out and had a combo vacation/graduation party.  The second kid was supposed to graduate last December so we all once again made plans to go.  This is where I’ll share that I am a planner and my in laws are decidedly NOT.  It drives me crazy sometimes, especially when it comes to travel.  I like to plan so I can budget and pay off things and basically make the most out of whatever trip.  They procrastinate making actual plans or booking things until it’s literally last minute even if we’ve been talking about something for a year.  So, I booked our trip as soon as my sil gave us the dates.  Well, long story short, my niece didn’t end up graduating on time because she missed out on some classes or whatever.  We decided to go through with the trip anyways, since we would be out a lot of money if we didn’t just go.  No one else joined us but that is what it is.

Fast forward to this spring and I texted my SILs seeing if they wanted to grab a meal and come to find out, they were ALL (the entire side of the family 20+ people) there visiting!!!!  They didn’t even hint they going anywhere, let alone invite us.  I felt really left out and hurt.

Now, just the other day my SIL says there aren’t enough graduation tickets (my nephew was graduating high school) but there’s enough for just my husband.  So he goes, along with most of the family—everyone that is local at least) and then they went out to dinner (not near the graduation, actually near my house) and I wasn’t even invited to that.

Finally, my three SIL sent a text saying that they wanted to take my kids out for ice cream, which is kinda out of the blue but ok.  After responding it’s ok for them to go, come to find out all of that side of the family is going to be there, not just kids, so I really wanna know why I’m not invited.  Like seriously WTF?!

30,1dc5urb,AITA for snitching on my cousin for what he said,"I really have to get some personal opinions on this as this has started affecting my mental health for a bit

So My (17F) cousin (9M) really doesn’t really have a strong bond with any of our cousins and some of our aunts because of his behavior and personality. I know he is just a kid however he made multiple snide remarks on the past on either my ethnicity (I’m really mixed) or my personal struggles on some shit. 

My cousin, let’s call him A, has this huge habit of just being an asshole in general however my aunts uncles and parents always defend his actions saying that he doesn’t know any better and that we should just deal with it but it has come to a point where most of us don’t want to be around him because he lies a lot whenever he gets in trouble, he keeps bragging about his nonexistent ancestry (one of my cousin is Half Malagasy and Haitian, since then he won’t stop saying that he also is Haitian when in fact that cousin is only related to me on my dad’s side meanwhile A is from my mom’s side), he also is really misogynistic towards the girls in my family etc..

So back onto the story, Yesterday we were at a family gathering like always and we were just minding our own business when A came outta nowhere and started asking me for my origins and religion (I’m agnostic however I hate talking about it as my family is super religious) then I got annoyed and asked him to leave me alone then my other cousin D (17F) took my defense and told him that it was none of his business and that he should focus on his receding hairline instead as a joke. Then he just brought up my cousin not having a dad (her dad died three years ago and she still hasn’t recovered) then I just had enough and decided to talk to my Aunt ( A’s mother) in private so she could talk to him

Understandably she was really mad at A and started scolding him then she just started yelling at him because he kept trying to twist the story over and over again. After a while she just went back with our parents then later when we were in the car my mom started berating me, calling me an asshole for deciding to speak to my aunt instead of solving it in private with A and educating him (he doesn’t respect me and trying to reason with him would be futile)

After a while of her just ranting in the car about how immature and sensitive I was I just stopped listening altogether especially cause she kept praising herself at the same time when I knew damn well she was absent for almost half of my life and just leaving me with my aunt in Canada and only came to get me cause my grandma hadn’t seen me in years.

32,1dc5r7k,AITA for calling animal control and getting my brother’s cats taken away?,"I (33) live with my roommate/brother (30; he/they) in a two bed, two bath house. We’ve lived together for three years now. For context, he/they have two cats, one of which they acquired while living together.

With the first cat (3 yrs old), the litter and food were kept in my brother's room. Then, my brother adopted a second cat, 9 mos old, and bought a 2nd litter box. They kept it in the living area, and this is when our conflict began. The area would frequently smell strongly of litter. I’d go over to the litter box and see piles of urine and feces. For months, I’d clean the litter box, both for my comfort and for the cats' health. Sometimes I’d sneak into my brother's room to clean the litter box there if it smelled strongly.

Anyways, this went on for awhile until I realized this was not my job. They were not my cats and I was not being paid to take care of them. So I sat down with my brother and described the exact issues I was seeing: litter going uncleaned for several days; unbathed cats; constant meowing for attention (I work from home). My brother said they’d come up with a solution

A month passed, and then the issues resurfaced: strong litter smell, constant meowing, excess shedding from lack of bathing. This broke my heart for the animals and I sat my brother down again. I explained the importance of keeping a clean litter box and bathing cats. They said they weren’t following the initial plan because they’d “forget” but would try a different method. Around this time we got a release offer and request for rabies vaccine documents. My brother ""would get to it.""

Another month went by, and our landlord reminded us of the release offer. The landlord needed the vaccine paperwork, so I asked my roommate for it. They said they didn’t do it yet “but would get to it.” I then had to leave for a week for business. When I returned, the smell of dirty cat litter reeked throughout the apartment and the cats were howling. They were shedding so badly and obviously very uncomfortable. My brother wasn't home. I called him and asked him where he was and what happened to the cats. They said they forgot. I asked them about the updated vaccinations. They said they hadn’t gotten to it yet.

Heres where I may be the ahole. I called animal control and had them taken away for animal neglect. I signed the release papers and submitted them to my landlord, writing in the email that the animals had been given away.

My brother returned home a week later. They asked me where the cats were and I told them the truth. They broke down in hysterics and screamed at me, asking me how in the world could I take them away like that. They are now not speaking to me. AITA for what I did?

33,1dc5mst,AITA Complicated relationship w parents. They want to visit for six weeks on my dime,"I've struggled with abusive parents that didn't observe boundaries or respected my space my entire life. I'm 44 now and still dealing with the consequences of it. Despite, I worked hard my entire life and made the best of it. In 2016 they agreed to move to the US so they sold all their belongings to move here. I waited three months to confirm if that was indeed what they wanted and sponsored their green card. About four months into it, I got a job across the country and left them at my house, with food delivery, and transportation at their disposal. They had some friends in the area too, so in my mind they were set. As soon as I got to my destination, they emailed me and said they had left the country. Abandoning a green card process is a big deal and people can’t come back in for 10 years. I related that to them and they signed a piece of paper saying they understood it. Their excuse was that they had religious and family commitments back home — to be fair to them, my grandmother wasn’t well. But what bothers me is that their green card was issued 30 days after they left. They couldn’t have waited that long to garantee their coming and going to visit their only kid. Since I’ve already struggle with abandonment issues and anxious attachment, that felt like a nail in the coffin. Then COVID hit, this timeline went south — now they are asking to visit me again.  I have miles I can use to book them a flight for six weeks. My mom is “determined” to spend her birthday here and my dad asked me to extend it for eight weeks because “they aren’t getting any younger, life is getting harder, and they don’t know when they will see me again.” They are both in their late 60s and I feel really bad — but the thought of having them here, and dealing with them for six weeks is giving me panic attacks.

For context, they have two cats, one of which they acquired while living together. I do not own any animals but petsit as a side hustle. 

At the beginning, with one cat, there weren’t any issues. I am allergic to cats but began taking antihistamines every day and got regular allergy shots to manage my allergies. With the first cat (about 3 years old), the litter and food were kept in my roommates room. Then, my roommate adopted a second cat, about 9 months old, and consequently bought a second litter box. They kept it in the living area, and this is when our problems began. The area would frequently smell strongly of litter. I’d go over to the litter box and see piles of urine and feces, and would smell that same smell emanating from their room. For many months, I’d clean the litter box in the common area, both for my comfort and for the comfort of the animals (i know how uncomfortable that level of feces in a litter box is for a cat). Sometimes I’d sneak into my roommates room to clean the litter box there if it smelled particularly strongly.

Anyways, this went on for awhile until I realized this was not my job. They were not my cats and I was not being paid to take care of them. So I sat down with my roommate and described the exact issues I was seeing: litter going uncleaned for several days, if not a week; unbathed cats; constant meowing at my door for attention (I work from home). My roommate said they’d come up with a schedule to fix the problem. 

A month of tranquility passed, and then the problems surfaced again: strong litter smell, constant calls for attention from the cats, excess shedding from lack of bathing. This broke my heart for the animals and I sat my roommate down again, and explained the importance of keeping a clean litter box and giving cats regular baths, especially during spring to keep shedding down. They said they weren’t following the initial plan because they’d “forget” but would try a different method to keep track.

Another month or so of tranquility follows. We get a re-lease offer from our apartment. I bring it up to my roommate and they agree on another year of a lease. In our lease agreement, it requires us to give our landlord yearly documentation of rabies vaccines for any animals kept on the property. My roommate informed me the cats are several months past their needed rabies shots and explained they “didn’t have the money to take them to the vet” (even though they’d just purchased new motorcycle). I pointed out you could get vaccines at petco for $30 or less.

Another month has gone by, and our landlord reminded us of the release offer. The landlord needed the vaccine paperwork, so I asked my roommate for it. They said they didn’t do it yet “but would get to it.” I then had to leave for a week to petsit/housesit for a client, and when I returned, the apartment was despicable. The smell of dirty cat litter reeked throughout the apartment and the cats came to me screaming for attention. They were shedding so badly and obviously very uncomfortable. My roommate wasn’t home. I called them and asked them where the f\*ck they were and what happened to cleaning the litter. They said they forgot. I asked them about the updated vaccinations. They said they hadn’t gotten to it yet.Heres where I may be the ahole. Our release agreement was due the very next day. Since my roommate wasn’t home, and was obviously not getting vaccines for the animals, I called animal control and had them taken away for animal neglect. I signed the release papers and submitted them to my landlord, writing in the email that the animals had been given to animal control and no paperwork was needed.

My roommate returned home a week or so later. They asked me where the cats were and I told them the truth. They broke down in hysterics and screamed at me, telling me those were their babies and how in the world could I take them away like that. They are now not speaking to me. AITA for what I did?

TL;DR my roommate wouldn’t get cats vaccinated before release agreement despite needing to and I called animal control to report animal neglect, leading to the cats being taken away.

39,1dc4zd8,AITA for dying my hair?,"My bf and I are 20. I've been looking for a job because I cut off my parents and we live together. I'm not in summer classes, and I have been trying to get a job while in college. But I've applied everywhere in the city and no one is hiring.

The jobs aren't campus don't give you many hours, so I don't want to work there. But I've applied to over 40+ jobs and have gotten interviews but have not gotten a job. It does really suck because when I don't have loan money, my bf has to cover me. Luckily he has a job, multiple actually.

He has said before that he thinks I'm not getting called back because I dye my hair fun colors and maybe because of piercings? He told me I should dye my hair a natural color and that I'll get jobs then. I told him that was ridiculous. I doubt they care what color my hair is. I'm not getting calls back because of lack or experience and because I'm young and maybe because of sexism. Not because of my hair color.


Well, yesterday he saw I died my hair and bright pink and instead of being supportive he said this is why I keep not getting job offers, that people are a lot less likely to hire me if I have bright pink hair.

I told him that was a really rude reaction, he should be supporting me, for one. Not getting a job has to do with my lack of experience. He said he got a job just fine with no experience. I said it's probably because of sexism then. He said plenty of women work. I said because they have experience, not because of hair color.

We went back and forth and it really annoys me that he isn't supportive of my hair journey. I was so excited to dye it a fun color, I've never gone full pink before. A job should take me as I am.

41,1dc4wg6,WIBTA for calling my bestfriend out for faking being transgender?,"Would I Be The Asshole for calling my(15, FtM) best friend(15, FtM) out for being transgender just because I am?

I have been friends with this person since primary school, and we weren't really too close until a few years ago (both now in year 11 of secondary school ((I'm British)) and I feel like he's only trans because I am. He always picks up interests after me, like what anime or movie he'll currently be into, simply because I talk about it so much.

I started experimenting with my pronouns and gender identity within a close friend group a few years ago (about 3 or 4) and he was one of these. Long story short, after trying a few things out for a while, I decided that I was trans and prefered he/him. I've always hated feminine things like makeup, or dresses, so in a way it just felt right.

I don't remember exactly when, but my friend (we'll call him Carter from now on) came out not long after I had become comfortable with how I identified, and eventually decided he was trans too. He's always had a habit of lying about certain things to try get more attention or sympathy, like seeing ghosts or being followed home.

Now here's where I begun questioning him more: Since we are both in the same year at school, obviously prom is a big topic for us since it's quite soon. At first, it was just a small ""Oh, my mum's giving me £20 to try on a dress"", and now he's wearing a dress for prom with annoys me for two reasons.

One: He agreed that we would both wear suits together, not exactly matching, but just since it's what we both chose. He has gotten mad at me before for doing something without him, or changing plans, so him changing his mind was just sort've an asshole move, since now I feel like I'm the only feminine person there who will be wearing  a suit (we're both untransitioned. Me because my family doesn't exactly accept me. Him because... idk??)

The second reason I don't understand him wearing a dress is pretty obvious, I feel. He's transgender? Female to male? Would wearing the dress not make him dysphoric- which is the reason I absolutely shut down the idea of wearing a dress the second my mother brought it up.

That made me realise: I've never heard him talking about gender dysphoria, or wanting to look more masculine beyond ""oh I want my hair cut to my shoulders"". That could be fine, if he didn't tell me literally anything else, from complaining about family or other friends, to his mental health and other private or sensitive stuff.

This guy is literally so open to me and yet not once has he talked about dysphoria or hating being feminine, and now he's wearing a dress for money that he admitted was just a lie anyway, so he's doing it for free because he ""likes how it looks""??

So, i told my gf about this and she says i’m trying to be territorial, defensive or protective with my classmate, this led to a discussion and she is now really mad at me and don’t know what to do.
This post is not bc i’m asking if i’m really the asshole, because i know i’m (as a guy with a gf) supposed to not have any girl friends or any resemblance to confidence. I’m just asking what should i do",3.0,1.062975287437439,1,0
45,1dc4ijq,AITA for asking my brother not to invite my ex into our house because I don't want his presence in my space?,"I (22M) and my twin brother (also 22M) share a house alone. Before that, we used to share an apartment with my ex (now 23M). My ex and I broke up a good period of time before moving out of that apartment and during this phase, he became really close with my brother since I never really wanted to be around him anymore and they both had no one else to hang out with. They would usually smoke up and watch a sitcom or something.

I have tried making it as clear as possible to my brother how I don't necessarily hate my ex, but I simply do not like his presence anymore after what he did to me.

Ever since moving back to this house, my brother has been very alone. He refuses to make any new friends even though I keep encouraging him to. He just spends his days at home with me when I'm available or alone when I'm out with my current boyfriend. 

Today, I told my brother that I'm gonna be taking him out to have fun (cancelled plans with my bf to do this) and he said yes. A few hours later, he says that my ex is gonna be coming over tonight to smoke and watch TV and that he isn't going out with me anymore. I kept explaining about how I don't want this person's presence in my space and how I'd be okay with it as long as it's happening away from me. He kept refusing to cancel on my ex while using the fact that I invite my bf over sometimes even though he hates him as a defense. I tried my best to explain how the person he's inviting over is MY ex and how he wouldn't even be friends with him if it weren't for me while he has absolutely no history and therefore no say in whether I bring my bf over to sit in my room.

He refuses to accept the fact that I'm allowed to not want my ex's presence in my house and keeps insisting that if I'm allowed to bring someone he dislikes (my current bf) over, then he's allowed to bring someone I dislike over (my ex).

So we got into this huge fight which ended up with me telling him that I don't want him to be my brother anymore as long has he disrespects my feelings and rights. AITA for that?

Which I don't have any problems with (mostly because I can't control his actions) but he does have a habit of not having etiquette about it (blowing vape in our face, hotboxxing us in his car/room, etc). 

He also, much more recently, smokes weed. 

None of this is a problem except this time he had a dragonfruit watermelon geek bar. And coincidentally, the only thing in the world I'm allergic to is dragonfruit. Which he knows of. 

Naturally, I had a bit of a reaction. The usual itchy mouth, throat, tight chest, tingly face and despite my protest, he wouldn't stop. Mind you, I'm fairly new to this allergy so everytime I get exposed to it, my reaction gets worse everytime. So just the vapor was making me feel like shit. 

I decide to go to the bathroom for a bit and consider whether on just leaving for the day since I didn't want my reactions to worsen. And I don't know what possessed me to text my mom and fake a phone call but I did. Albeit my acting was shit, I did end up leaving with the excuse that my mom wanted me home. 

Later, we get into an argument through text where he says I shouldn't have made it a big deal and to have been honest about making me uncomfortable. Where I responded with how I do but then gets mad at me for, in his words, being a buzzkill. This went on for a bit, with him saying things like how I had prejudices against him for simply having fun, calling me fake for faking the phone call, and insinuating he was stupid. 

Now, my friend and I have had a rocky past. We butt heads often and end up fighting pretty much every other hang out but we've stayed friends. Whether that's a good idea on my part is on me but this isn't the first time we've fought like this. 

Eventually, I had begun to feel guilt and after a day I basically apologized for my behavior. He hadn't replied or even read it, so I'm giving him some space. 

So now I'm just wondering if I'm the asshole for blowing it out of proportion.

48,1dc4crl,AITA for wanting these people out of my apartment?,"About 3 months ago a friend of my girlfriend and her boyfriend asked if they could stay at our house for a few weeks as they saved up for a new car.

They offered us $200 a week because they travel the country doing UberEats and that’s much cheaper than staying in a hotel and nicer than sleeping in their car.

Now I want to state even though this is my girlfriends friend they were never that close and we don’t really know her boyfriend at all. She basically just watched her kid as a babysitting job and they kinda got along. 

It was fine for a few weeks, they gave us money and they worked everyday. 3 weeks was cutting it cause technically we aren’t even supposed to have guests that long in our apartment. 

The friend has a tumor and has seizures. At week 3 the car they had stopped working right. They couldn’t go out for long everyday because it kept overheating and the girl had a couple seizures.So we let them stay a bit longer. 

It’s been 3 months now. They’ve stopped giving us money completely. I am disabled myself and bring in very little income, so my girlfriend is basically supporting four full grown adults. I’ve been asking my parents to help lately but I can’t ask them forever either. 

They got the car kind of fixed about a week ago and my niece was supposed to come visit so I told them they had to be out by Tuesday. Well today their car apparently pooped out completely. Now they’re asking if they can sleep in their dead car in the apartment parking lot…which they can’t because I don’t wanna risk loosing my apartment as they shouldn’t have been here this long anyways. They used to be gone all day so it wasn’t a huge deal but now the car is just sitting there and management can see it so I’m worried about it messing up our security. 

She also had a seizure and went to the hospital yesterday and are really laying on the guilt.

I’ve been sick a lot since they’ve been here because I’m cooking,cleaning etc and they have only offered one time in months to help and since they’ve been here I’ve noticed BUGS and I keep telling them to clean up their mess but yesterday when she had the seizure I moved stuff so they could get to her in the room I found bags of trash under their clothes and stuff. 

She was just crying saying she doesn’t know where they’ll go and part of me wants to move things around so she can stay because I feel bad but the other part of me wants to put my foot down and say they have to leave no matter what.

But we can’t afford them anymore, I can’t clean up after them anymore and my family can’t come visit while they’re here. Would I be the asshole to put my foot down? 

EDITED TO ADD: We also were asked if we could do something nice for his birthday, which I didn’t mind but that ended up being the first week they didn’t pay us and I kept expecting to get it back so basically we spent $150 on his birthday meal THAT I COOKED 🤷🏻‍♀️ and somehow the girlfriend still got partial credit for that?

We have been in most of the same classes because we take the same ones. The year before she fell head over heels for this man (16M) I won't say he wasn't attractive because he was and I was happy she was opening up after her last relationship but she made it clear that them getting together would never happen.

Yet the following year he's in almost all the same classes as both of us and they start talking. I was friends with him as well but not as close with him as I was with her but we were all close. Fast forward a few months and I'm absent and the next day their holding hands while she is all over him. I brush it off yet I feel awkward keep in mind they're not dating yet. I start to become the 3rd wheel it's me walking behind them it's them shoving me to the side and when I back off I get comments like ""Shes just being moody"" or ""how rude!"".

Soon enough I get annoyed and rant it to another friend (15F) where my BFF has only seen her once or twice. So I rant about how annoying it is to become the third wheel and how they are holding hands and sleeping on each other while I'm just there! So I rant for maybe 4 days in a row before I give up and distance myself slightly. In those 4 days I have contemplated telling her how I feel but knowing her if I tell her she would yell and scream at me for not liking her being happy. I didn't want her to unfriend me because I don't like her relationship but I wanted to be included! I ranted more about how them making out in front of me is just so annoying and they can see how visually uncomfortable it makes me.Fast forward 2 weeks and she confronted me about talking behind her back screaming at me thinking I have been doing it for months straight! 

This was our falling out and now I make new friends each class as she ignores me and snuggles with her boyfriend 24/7.

51,1dc439f,AITA for calling someone an asshole and sending bibles to their house,"For introductions, we have Olive, the person in question, and our friendgroup composed of Nika, Lana, Jay and I for simplicity’s sake. 

A little bit of background on Olive is that they’d been the center of a lot of fights in my year, and I knew for a fact they enjoyed hurting people in that way. I was under no impression that they’d be at my wedding, but they were a person i confided into a lot. 

Near the end of the year, Olive sends me a text : ""hey, is it just me or have you been lacking tact recently?"". I told them that i was on edge as the musical, of which i was in charge of, was just a few days away. they asked what they could do to help, and i answered that if they wanted, they could help with the musical, but that it was my esponsibility, and they didn’t have to. They then went on an entire tangent about feeling exclusded from the musical. to be clear, they had been invited to help in the begining, but then had never showed up to any rehearsal or any staff meeting, which i reminded them of. They eventually told me my friends all hated me.

i blocked them, and that was essentially it, as the year ended just a few days later and then that was it.

at the begining of the year, though, Lana, came to talk to me about the fact that Olive had asked them not to keep looking at their insta stories, which Lana complied to even though they hadn’t done anything. a few months later, Olive posts ""its so fun to manipulate people"" only to send a text to Lana the NEXT DAY asking them if they’d know what the apologize for if they could. Lana told them they didn’t have anything to apologize for. I texted O calling them an asshole. 

then, they tried signing me up to tinder and grindr, but as those require verification from the phone number, i only got the notification.they did manage to put me on a job search website, which meant a lot of annoying calls in the morning. i retaliated by sending a whole lot of free bibles to their home, as well as jehova's witnesses.

Jay in that time stopped talking to Olive, who sent them a text calling her unlovable and telling her they regretted defending her from her abusive sister.

I snapped a little bit, and wrote them a paragraph about my grievances with them as a person. This, I think, went a bit over the line as I said some pretty shit stuff in there, as much as I think it was deserved. 

Olive then wrote a letter to my parents, not only accusing me of having consistently bullied her for over a year, but also outing me, which ended up not causing issues as my dad was the first one home and asked for my side of the story, but could have been really dangerous for some of the other people involved. 

I do think that maybe i should have let it go rather than sending them an angry paragraph, but i believe that they crossed a line in doing something that could have ended up in people getting hurt. I don't know. I'm letting pose your judgement here.

i blocked them, and that was essentially it, as the year ended just a few days later and then that was it.

at the begining of the year, though, Lana, came to talk to me about the fact that Olive had asked them not to keep looking at their insta stories, which Lana complied to even though they hadn’t done anything. a few months later, Olive posts ""its so fun to manipulate people"" only to send a text to Lana the NEXT DAY asking them if they’d know what the apologize for if they could. Lana told them they didn’t have anything to apologize for. I texted O calling them an asshole. 

then, they tried signing me up to tinder and grindr, but as those require verification from the phone number, i only got the notification.they did manage to put me on a job search website, which meant a lot of annoying calls in the morning. i retaliated by sending a whole lot of free bibles to their home, as well as jehova's witnesses.

Jay in that time stopped talking to Olive, who sent them a text calling her unlovable and telling her they regretted defending her from her abusive sister.

I snapped a little bit, and wrote them a paragraph about my grievances with them as a person. This, I think, went a bit over the line as I said some pretty shit stuff in there, as much as I think it was deserved. 

Olive then wrote a letter to my parents, not only accusing me of having consistently bullied her for over a year, but also outing me, which ended up not causing issues as my dad was the first one home and asked for my side of the story, but could have been really dangerous for some of the other people involved. 

I do think that maybe i should have let it go rather than sending them an angry paragraph, but i believe that they crossed a line in doing something that could have ended up in people getting hurt. I don't know. I'm letting pose your judgement here.

55,1dc3cyx,AITAH for wanting my husband to bag his luggage after getting bedbugs at a hotel?,"My (39F) husband (44M) have been married for 16 years, together for 20. We have two kids, an 11M and 7F. My son has severe ADHD and gives us a run for our money. My husband travels for work a lot, every few weeks he is gone for anywhere from 1 to 5 or more weeks. Sometimes this travel falls back to back. It’s part of his job, it’s hard but it is what it is. 

I am often basically a single mom, I also work and work in the evenings. I don’t get home until 10/11p and then am always up at 6:30a with the kids. We make do with babysitters. We have no family nearby but my mom will come in for a week at a time when my husband has a lot of travel to help out. Bless her. We live in NYC. 

This last travel my husband, unfortunately, had a pretty bad experience with bedbugs in his hotel room. Honestly I’m shocked it’s never happened before. He was completely eaten. The hotel moved his room and dry cleaned his luggage and clothing. I am TERRIFIED of bedbugs. Its is a horror. I feel so bad this happened to my husband. I did a lot of research and everything I read said to bag his stuff when he gets back, let it sit for a month, then retreat. Cross contamination between rooms is common in hotels. I told him when he got home I wanted him to bag everything just in case. 

He had to take a red eye home this past week, he was tired and cranky. I happened to be outside in the front gardening when he got in and before he went inside with his luggage I insisted he bag it all. And he got pissed off. He argued with me that it was unnecessary and he was tired and he didn’t want to do it. I still insisted. He threw his hands up, started slamming his shit and being an absolute jerk. Slammed his luggage into some garbage bags, threw them down in our front foyer and muttered under his breathe “great I’m home. Time to shut up and do what I’m told.”

I absolutely LOST IT. I run myself ragged taking care of our family and our home, often doing it all when he’s gone. If we ever got a bedbug infestation it would be a nightmare. Especially if he was out of town again and I had to deal with it solo. I screamed. I threw a piece of watermelon at the wall. I told him to f*ck off and not talk to me again, then I had to go to work. I have not talked to him since, I’m sleeping in another room. 

I have to run a tight ship to get everything done, to get my kids everywhere they need to be. And my kids are kids, they can be tough. When my husband gets home I need a partner to help me and to keep our family safe, not a petulant teenager. I really don’t want to talk to him until he apologizes which he has not.  I refuse to be the first to extend the olive branch, I always am but I’m too mad this time. 

So AITAH?

UPDATE: husband and I talked last night. We both apologized, everything was copacetic and I slept in our bedroom. Yay!

This morning I realized he had done nothing over the weekend to help mitigate any possible infestation (I worked all weekend, 11 hours on Saturday and 6 hours on Sunday). I thought we had been pretty clear on Friday that further preventative steps had to be taken. He didn’t feel like it over the weekend and even threw his laundry in our washer, mixed with other laundry, and left it there for a few days. He did no research, didn’t vacuum. Nothing. We got into another argument. I realized that my safety and the kids safety is not something I should have to negotiate and plead for and this is a deeper issue. 

I originally came to Reddit because my initial reaction was so severe the other morning.  I know I am not a Domestic Abuser, as some suggested. I was so triggered. Now I know it’s because I have reached a hard boundary.

Linda is constantly late for work, usually half an hour, sometimes even an hour. She also has a habit of going in and out of the shop numerous times, either to smoke, talk on the phone, or do food shopping. To top it all up, she has anger issues. If a colleague makes a mistake, even a minor one like forgetting to top up the football coupons or some pens dispenser at the end of the night, she makes a show of chewing them out in the presence of other colleagues and customers too, saying they're not concentrating on the job and need to wake up. 

Other colleagues are wary of working with her, worried they might say or do something to offend her. I have on previous occasions spoken my concerns about Linda to our shop manager (39M), who has known and worked with her the longest. Our shop manager insists we need to cut her some slack as she's not always the way she is now and is going through a divorce. Nonetheless, he said he had spoken to her but then she's still behaving the same way she did even after their talks.

Last night, I had the unfortunate luck of doing the closing shift together with Linda. About two hours before we closed the shop, however, I went to use the bathroom. There was only one customer in the shop at that time, playing slots on the machine. I've noticed before this man was pretty frustrated losing his money but he wasn't behaving aggressively like hitting the machines. As I was in the middle of doing my business, I heard Linda and this customer shouting suddenly, so I quickly cleaned up and ran back out. Basically, the guy was asking ""What's wrong with these machines? Did you guys fix them?"" and Linda responded ""Don't be an idiot."" which caused this huge argument in the first place. I had to intervene since this shouting was going nowhere. I managed to have a calm conversation with the customer, gave him some water, and convinced him to leave the shop.

After the customer left, Linda was like ""Yeah, why don't you offer him grapes too."" and I was shaking my head in response. Next, she asked me ""What's your problem? You got something you want to say?"" so then I asked her ""You sure you want to hear this? You won't like it."". Once she said ""Yes"", I decided to tell her plainly of all her problems (her lateness and anger issues). I only shared my thoughts, not what other colleagues said about her. I didn't mention anything about her divorce either. She didn't take this well, however, got emotional, took her stuff, and left me alone to close up the shop on my own.

However, due to the nature of the job, some weeks I have to go in more often.

My uncle (50M) and aunt (36F) live around 5-10 minutes away from my office, so I stay with them occasionally. They have a daughter (5F) and are obsessed with her sleep. I won’t get into all of it but they are very paranoid that she won’t get enough sleep or will get woken up (not sure what they think will happen) but for all of their eccentricities she is a lovely child, and loves it when I come to stay. 

I want to stress that I do not stay often, maybe once every 2-3 months just to save on money/time and also to see them as I don’t get to see them very much. They have some interesting house rules when I come to stay- my cousin obviously goes to bed quite early, but we aren’t allowed to eat dinner until after she goes to bed (she eats by herself earlier). When we eat dinner, we are only allowed to whisper in case it wakes her up. They also obsessively watch her sleep on a video camera baby monitor thing, and if we watch TV together it has to be on mute or very low volume. There is only one bathroom in their house (upstairs where bedrooms are) and one of their rules is that I can’t flush the toilet while she is in bed, which I think is strange but whatever. 

Last week when I stayed the night, we followed the usual routine and I went up to get ready for bed, and ended up going number 2 in the toilet. I can’t really control that, but I felt really embarrassed as they were going to have to go up and use the same toilet, so I flushed it away. Cue my aunt going absolutely crazy, saying that I could wake her daughter up and ruin her sleep for school the next day. I said that I didn’t want that to sit in the toilet all night as it wasn’t nice for them or me. She has told my whole family how “rude” I am for not caring about my cousins sleep, even though she didn’t wake up throughout all of this. 

They have said that I cannot stay again unless I apologise, which I obviously feel bad but I don’t really think I have much to apologise for? My cousin didn’t wake up but I don’t have kids so maybe I just don’t understand.

61,1dc2iiu,WIBTA for uninviting my brother to my wedding after he canceled on hosting the wedding.  ,"My fiancé and I decided we wanted to have an intimate wedding ceremony instead of a large wedding. For the venue, we asked my brother and SIL if we could have it in their back yard about a year ago. They said they would be honored to host. We knew it was a big ask, since they had a 2nd newborn on the way, and promised we would be unobtrusive as possible and take care of everything that needed to be taken care of. For guest count, we are at 26 people. So as intimate as possible for a backyard wedding. They insisted it would be a wonderful setting and it would mean a lot to them to have it there as well. 

We’re pretty close knit. We come from a household of strong family values and grew up together. 

So we’re about 1.5 months out from our wedding day and my brother just informed us that they could no longer host the wedding at their place. 

Through happenstance, their nanny/family friend (who’s also monk) found out we were having our wedding there and told them it would bring less luck to their family. Apparently the superstition goes that if you host a siblings wedding at your house, you give away your luck to that family. And now that they are new parents to a 6mo and 2 year old, they don’t want anything to happen to them and want to give them the best chance at life they possibly can. 

Nobody knew about this until now. Our family has never really been superstitious. I know my SIL’s family is more conservative and believes in these sort of things. 

I’m pretty tolerant of others beliefs systems. And while I don’t understand it I do respect it. But we are literally less than 2 months out now from our big day. Fortunately a venue change isn’t too too difficult, but it definitely throws a curveball into logistics when we’ve had everything already set. 

I love my brother and would want the best for his family and the kiddos. But right now I don’t want anything to do with him. 

ADDING INFO:

•	⁠Edited 1st paragraph for clarity on timeline of when the ask was/grammar.

•	⁠We live in the US.

•	⁠Not sure what religion or sect- guessing Buddhism. Or feng shui.

•	⁠He did try to find us a new venue. Not well thought out options but still tried nonetheless. Did offer to cover whatever additional cost to send out invites.

•	⁠Was not explicitly stated but based on our relationship and knowing my brother he would try to cover the venue cost.

So today i find out another bit of my extended family is coming and his reaction was very negative saying he didn't want them to come and that if it gets too overwhelming he'll go back to my home alone. This was before i actually got confirmation of them coming. Then i got confirmation and told him and i got the same negative reaction to which i started lecting him about this being a very rare occasion for only a few hours and him being scared of my family because he has social anxiety (which i have very severely too so i should get it) should be overlooked as this being important to me and my family is worth being uncomfortable for half a day. Not sure what its like in other places but especially here family and big family is a big thing in terms of relationships and its important to introduce your longterm partners. 

EDIT: his social anxiety is very manageable so far, he has many friends that he talks to with no issue and and teachers he talks to fine too. He genuinely just finds it uncomfortable from what he's told me whereas my social anxiety makes me disassociate, shake, sometimes cry, and affected for hours after.

63,1dc24jt,WIBTA for asking my SO's sister to take her praying/religious activities outside the home,"#Backstory

I (32M) have been with my SO (30F) for a few years. One of our major hick-ups is on the topic of religion. I grew up in a strict christian sect and left that religion in my teenage years, today I am agnostic and definitely do not believe in the idea of the Abrahamic God. My SO is a somewhat faithful muslim who fasts once a year, prays in her mind and performs no rituals in front of me — that is the person I got to know and the person I fell in love with. I live in a small apartment and half a year ago my SO and her sister moved in to my apartment due to losing their apartment.

Her sister is a more strict Muslim; she wears hijab and prays her mandatory prayers. When she prays she puts on a full body covering piece of cloth and then prays with her prayer mat. She does not eat anything she does not know is halal. So in my country there exists specific shops which might sell meat that is halal, but I usually shop in a normal grocery store which does not sell that.

#Issue
My SO knows very well about my trauma from growing up in a strict religious context. I have expressed my feelings of anxiety when I see her sister praying in my vicinity. I try to respect her sister, and honestly I feel her sister trying to respect me as well by going to a different room (there is not enough to have a private room unfortunately). But my SO keeps trying to make me adjust my shopping habits to fit her sister's diet when we cook food. I suggested that we just let her sister know if the food is halal or not, so then her sister can make her own food (which I am paying all for and without asking anything back).

There is a mosque just three minutes away from our apartment, I suggested to my SO that I can have a dialogue with her sister about my feelings and asking her to go there a few times to take the load off of me. I even said that I am not demanding anything, I am asking for compromises and mutual respect of each others' way of life and feelings. My SO regrets me even asking that, as she expresses that this would let her sister know my true feelings about religion — which she would rather not her family know about.

It is one of those things we are struggling with in our relation — her relatives' take on not accepting a non-muslim husband to her. Basically our children would be ""bastards"" and our marriage would be illegitimate in their eyes.

Please, I am looking for advice on how I can continue searching my mind for how I can deal with this situation. I think that I would be okay with the situation as is, but I really deep down feel sad about not being able to be my true self around my SO, and this feeling is amplified in the vicinity of her sister/family as they are more religious and the family ties is super important for my SO due to her cultural background.

He has only passed his test a short while ago, and in the UK if you get 6 points within a year or something (I’m not sure the exact rule) then you get a ban and have to re take your test.

We were on a road that was alternating 60mph and 40mph and we were chatting away, the next thing a camera flashes him. He hadn’t noticed the speed limit change and went straight through the camera at 60mph.

66,1dc1v1m,AITA for telling him I don’t want to be responsible for making him feel better?,"Husband (38M) and I (33F) are celebrating our ten year anniversary in Italy. Traveling is our thing and we try to take at least one overseas trip a year. The only issue is that my immune system sucks and something usually comes up on these trips. Once it was seasonal allergies that got really bad. Once it was an extremely painful UTI. Nothing that a quick pharmacy trip can’t fix, but it still happens almost every time. I eat extremely healthy, stay active, and do everything I can to keep my body at its peak. I also pack a little first aid kit of things I might need on the trip so that I can fix anything quickly.

This trip I’m the sickest I’ve been in YEARS. Before the flight was even done I was vomiting everything up including water. That stopped but I was still nauseous. I took tablets to help with the nausea and it helped a little but I still felt too sick to eat. After a few days the nausea went away but swapped out for a chest cough. I took DayQuil and that mostly helped. Now that the cough has faded the nausea is coming back (no vomiting though).

In the past my husband has told me that my inability to stay healthy ruins trips for him. He expresses how inconvenient it is when I get sick at home but he gets extra upset when it’s during a trip. I’ve developed contamination OCD as a result of his constant judgment of my immune system. When traveling, I always encourage him to go out and enjoy the city and do planned events even if I can’t but he tells me it’s not fun on his own. This would be sweet if he wasn’t so vocal about how I’m ruining vacations for him.

Italy is his dream trip. I tried to keep up so he could have fun. I tried soooo hard. I tried not to talk about how sick I felt because he would get all quiet and distant if I did. I tried to make sure we went to all the museums and restaurants had planned even if I couldn’t eat anything. But today I finally told him I needed to sit in the hotel room and rest.

As expected, he got quiet and distant. He assured me that he’s not mad at me for being sick, but he’s still sad that he can’t enjoy his vacation because he’s too worried about my wellbeing. I asked if he could please order us room service since he didn’t want to go out to the city for his meal and he said he can’t, he has social anxiety. He has literally never said this in the 12 years we’ve known each other. He moped silently on his phone while I ordered us food.

I told him that it sucks that he gets all distant and visibly upset when I’m sick and when I finally ask for help he tells me no. I feel like I have to put my own health on hold to take care of his emotions first. He told me I was mean for saying I didn’t want to take care of his emotions and he’s allowed to be sad.

AITA for feeling like at the very least I shouldn’t have to make him feel better about me being sick?

EDIT: To answer questions, no I have never been checked for auto immune disorders or issues with iron levels. It’s something I’m going to look into.

Also, me getting sick has never been an issue for more than an hour tops. I was allergic to something growing in Egypt, bought antihistamines as soon as I could and was fine. I had a UTI in Ecuador, got antibiotics within an hour and was fine. I had a stomach ache in Ecuador later after a dinner and didn’t feel up to coffee after and said I would go back to the room. It’s never been something that took out whole days or even half days of our plans.

Nothing that a quick pharmacy trip can’t fix, but it still happens almost every time. I eat extremely healthy, stay active, and do everything I can to keep my body at its peak. I also pack a little first aid kit of things I might need on the trip so that I can fix anything quickly.

This trip I’m the sickest I’ve been in YEARS. Before the flight was even done I was vomiting everything up including water. That stopped but I was still nauseous. I took tablets to help with the nausea and it helped a little but I still felt too sick to eat. After a few days the nausea went away but swapped out for a chest cough. I took DayQuil and that mostly helped. Now that the cough has faded the nausea is coming back (no vomiting though).

In the past my husband has told me that my inability to stay healthy ruins trips for him. He expresses how inconvenient it is when I get sick at home but he gets extra upset when it’s during a trip. I’ve developed contamination OCD as a result of his constant judgment of my immune system. When traveling, I always encourage him to go out and enjoy the city and do planned events even if I can’t but he tells me it’s not fun on his own. This would be sweet if he wasn’t so vocal about how I’m ruining vacations for him.

Italy is his dream trip. I tried to keep up so he could have fun. I tried soooo hard. I tried not to talk about how sick I felt because he would get all quiet and distant if I did. I tried to make sure we went to all the museums and restaurants had planned even if I couldn’t eat anything. But today I finally told him I needed to sit in the hotel room and rest.

As expected, he got quiet and distant. He assured me that he’s not mad at me for being sick, but he’s still sad that he can’t enjoy his vacation because he’s too worried about my wellbeing. I asked if he could please order us room service since he didn’t want to go out to the city for his meal and he said he can’t, he has social anxiety. He has literally never said this in the 12 years we’ve known each other. He moped silently on his phone while I ordered us food.

I told him that it sucks that he gets all distant and visibly upset when I’m sick and when I finally ask for help he tells me no. I feel like I have to put my own health on hold to take care of his emotions first. He told me I was mean for saying I didn’t want to take care of his emotions and he’s allowed to be sad.

AITA for feeling like at the very least I shouldn’t have to make him feel better about me being sick?

EDIT: To answer questions, no I have never been checked for auto immune disorders or issues with iron levels. It’s something I’m going to look into.

Also, me getting sick has never been an issue for more than an hour tops. I was allergic to something growing in Egypt, bought antihistamines as soon as I could and was fine. I had a UTI in Ecuador, got antibiotics within an hour and was fine. I had a stomach ache in Ecuador later after a dinner and didn’t feel up to coffee after and said I would go back to the room. It’s never been something that took out whole days or even half days of our plans. Our current time is the only time I’ve ever asked for a day to rest.",0.0,-0.0018310046289116,0,1

When they asked how tall the grass currently was I explained that it was just mowed a few days ago but I wasn’t happy with how it looks (and that my current landscaper gave me a 3 day window instead of just telling me when he was coming). 
He asked who it was and I played dumb “oh my husband normally takes care of it- I’m not sure” I just wasn’t trying to badmouth anyone. 
We agreed that we could come in 2 days to take a look at the yard and give me a quote. But then today he out of the messages me the following 

Lawn Guy: Just a quick question. What did the other guy charge you

Me: I don’t feel like that’s important to your quote. I’m not really comfortable answering that.

Lawn Guy: Okay, cause I would have probably matched it a beat but you know what if you're not comfortable entering any of my questions so I know what not to do it what to do, then have a good day

Me: You’re making me really uncomfortable with that message. It shouldn’t matter what the other man was charging. What should matter is what you will charge. I should be getting the best number you can give me despite any other quote that I got from anyone else. 

The number he is charging me shouldn’t no way affect the number you will charge me. I’m asking you for a quote. You already asked the other companies name and now you’re asking what they charge me. So if you would mow the lawn for $80 but you find out that the other guy was charging me 120 then suddenly your rate is gonna jump up to 120?

I don’t understand why that number would be relevant to you if you want my business then you should be giving me an honest price

Lawn Guy: Listen, big businesses. Do it so can ISO find Somebody Else? Because I'm no longer doing lawn care. You were the last one and you ruined it for everybody. Else because you couldn't simple question without being uncomfortable. Have a good day, don't respond to me

Me: Well, I’m glad I saved other customers from having to deal with something unpleasant experience.

Let me start by saying that both my parents are dead, my only living relative is my grand mother, I am a 36 year old guy, married with a child under 2 years old working 12h a day.

My grandmother used to live in Ukraine but I flew her to Europe. I found her an apartment, I help her pay her bills, I come once a week or once per 2 weeks to help her out with various tasks. But everyday she complains about something new and I am having a hard time with it. My wife says that she is manipulating me (guilt shaming) into doing all her work for her. For example first she needed me to organise for her cloths to come to my country, then she didn't like the apartment I picked (even though I paid for it, paid the deposit, installed her internet), then she couldn't understand how to work with the washing machine, then the dinner table wasn't comfortable so I bought her another one and set it up, then she couldn't go out to shop because she wasn't feeling well so I installed an app to have her groceries delivered, then her toilet couldn't flush so I paid for repairs...

Now she complains that her intercom doesn't work and she needs to go down stairs (she lives on the first floor with an elevator) to open when she gets deliveries. She also spent all her phone credits, so I should go and recharge her phone. She tells me she isn't feeling well and is in pain, so I bring her medicine, I come to bring her food and take out her trash. Each day there's a new problem for me to fix and I'm starting to get tired of it. She doesn't want to go to a retirement home, and needs constant assistance which I cannot provide because of my other responsibilities. When I try bringing it up, she starts crying, telling me she didn't chose this type of life and says it's better for her to go back to Ukraine and die from bombs...
Which makes me feel like crap, and I continue going and helping her out.

I don't know what to do, I am getting in fights with my wife about it because they also need me around to help out around the house, but I feel like it's my duty to help her out as I am the only living relative.

My dad's wife was a widow also and had a 7 year old daughter at the time. I didn't blend the way they wanted me to. I don't hate my dad's wife or stepdaughter. I never felt a family bond with them though. But my stepsister can be really sweet. She's also special needs and behaves very young as a result. She struggles to comprehend things the way someone her age (20) would. And her view of the world is very young. It makes her far easier to manipulate and far easier to upset. There were times when I still lived with them that I had to be SO careful about the things I talked about because she would get so upset. Movies had to be very happy and cheerful and could not have death or bullying or any sarcasm in them because they could really upset her.

Which is why I'm so angry right now.

So I'm expecting a baby and my stepsister was so excited the last time she saw me and she told me she was so excited for me to have a boy named after he dad. I asked her what she meant and she told me my dad and her mom told her that I was going to name a boy after her dad like I'd name a girl after my mom. She told me she hopes I have a boy and she was so excited and so easily believed that I was going to do that. I mentioned this to my dad and he sheepishly admitted they had told her that and that they were going to ask me to considering naming a son after my stepsister's dad because it would mean so much to her. I told him I wasn't going to do that and he should have known that. He told me they figured but they also really wanted his stepdaughter to be happy.

I spoke to him with his wife present and told him to correct the lie they told or he can deal with the consequences of not doing so. She told me I would be heartless to deny her daughter this. My dad asked why I wouldn't do it and I told him because I'm not the one who told the lie. I told him the choice was up to him and he can live with the consequences.

They said I was blackmailing them and playing games which wasn't fair.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-09,"AITA for telling my dad to correct his and his wife's lie to his stepdaughter or he can deal with the consequences? My dad remarried when I was 12 after the death of my mom. My dad's wife was a widow also and had a 7 year old daughter at the time. I didn't blend the way they wanted me to. I don't hate my dad's wife or stepdaughter. I never felt a family bond with them though. But my stepsister can be really sweet. She's also special needs and behaves very young as a result. She struggles to comprehend things the way someone her age (20) would. And her view of the world is very young. It makes her far easier to manipulate and far easier to upset. There were times when I still lived with them that I had to be SO careful about the things I talked about because she would get so upset. Movies had to be very happy and cheerful and could not have death or bullying or any sarcasm in them because they could really upset her.

Which is why I'm so angry right now.

So I'm expecting a baby and my stepsister was so excited the last time she saw me and she told me she was so excited for me to have a boy named after he dad. I asked her what she meant and she told me my dad and her mom told her that I was going to name a boy after her dad like I'd name a girl after my mom.

 were over, too, plus my friend Wade and his girlfriend Kelsey. So seven people in total. We were just sitting on the couch eating wings I brought and waiting for the game to start.

Something you should know about me is I was raised by my grandma and she was one of those old ladies with a lot of funny expressions. One was saying “don’t make a mountain out of a mole” when I was being over-dramatic. This phrase is part of my regular speech because of her and I never thought it could be offensive.

Well, Kelsey was telling a story about how she was five minutes late to work and got a write up. She said she was worried about being fired as it was her second tardy. I told Kelsey her boss sounds like a dick and to not worry about it, but she was still stressing. So I told her “don’t make a mountain out of a mole.”

Unfortunately, Kelsey has two large moles on her face, one above her eyebrow and one on her jawline area. Wade jumped to his feet, thumping his chest and trying to get in my face about “body shaming his love.”

It took me a minute to figure out why they were upset, as I didn’t connect the saying to the fact that Kelsey has moles. It honestly didn’t even pass my radar.

I apologized and explained that it was a common phrase growing up with my grandma, and, I wasn’t trying to comment on her moles at all. At this point, JP jumped in and said that the phrase is usually said as “don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill.” I never heard that variation, but I googled it later and he’s right.

Anyway, Kelsey accepted my apology but the vibe was ruined. Most people left as soon as the game ended, and our group chat has been totally silent since. I’m worried they all made a new GC without me.

Recently, my stepsister invited me to her bachelorette party. When I asked where it would be, she said it would be at a club where alcohol will be served. This was a problem for me as I haven’t been in a bar or club since I went cold turkey.

I told her I couldn’t go because being around alcohol is a trigger for me. My stepsister knows about my recovery, but she insisted it wouldn’t be a big deal if I just didn't drink. Like WTF.  I tried to explain that it's not that simple, and that me being around alcohol is dangerous for the progress I made. And how it reminds he about how much I lost.

She got upset and accused me of not supporting her during this big moment in her life. Later, my dad texted me, saying that I had really hurt her and that I should try harder to be there for her. Now, she’s is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel like the AH because my dad is making it seem like I’m putting my issues over her happiness. So am I?

86,1dbw9c2,WIBTA if I (30M) didn’t disclose the full details of my college dating/sex life to my cousin (19M) after he asked me questions about it?,"
I have many cousins on my mother's side; however, I am the closest to four cousins on my mother's side of the family. My cousins' mother, my aunt, and my mom are sisters, and they have been close forever, so naturally, our families are very close. When I was in college, I would spend holidays and breaks with my aunt, uncle, and cousins due to the fact that my college was closer to their home.  


Despite the age differences, my cousins and I have always been close. We share a special bond. We know each other very well. We share inside jokes, and we enjoy spending time together. We have been there for each other through good times and bad times. I have seen them grow up. They're my cousins but I look at them as sibling/best friends. They are my 'posse'.  

 My (19M) cousin finished his freshman year. He loves his school. I visited him at school and he was excited to show me around the school. I also met his friends and roommate. We talk very often. He tells me all about his college life. 

Recently, we were talking about dating in college, and the topic of sex came up. My cousin told me everything about his sex life including the number girls he hooked up with, the events surrounding the encounters, etc. Some of it was toxic but I tried to provide advice when needed without being judgmental. I told my cousin to be safe and to be mindful. I also told him that sex is a serious thing and it’s not wise to use girls for sex. My cousin asked me about my sex life in college. I kept it respectful but told him that I made some mistake but I learned from it. It was getting late, so I told my cousin that we’ll talk later. I love my cousin and I want him to make right choices. We have a very deep and close bond, but I am not sure to how to navigate this. Though I didn’t ask for him to disclose this information, I am glad he feels comfortable to confide in me about the things.

On the other hand, I feel weird talking to him about my college dating/sex life. This is my little cousin. He always tells me everything but this is new to me.

91,1dbur80,AITA for turning down a car from my husband?,"A few months ago my (34F) car was totaled in a freak accident. Thankfully no one was hurt, no one was in the car. We finally settled with insurance and I’m starting the car buying process again. I decided that since my old car was very basic I wanted to buy something a little nicer since I’m starting the car buying process over. My old car was a base model SUV. For my new car I was hoping to purchase something that had heated seats and a power tailgate. I use my car frequently to travel for sports, I haul equipment back and forth. Having a power tailgate seemed useful. We are also trying to start a family so I was car shopping with that in mind as well. 

Insurance gave me enough money to use  as a down payment on the new car. So I will need to finance. My husband (34 M) started to float the idea of him buying me a car. He drives and older station car and my car was our weekend car or trip car. I have declined his offer many times, because he is really pushing me to buy an EV. I do not think an EV is really the right car for me or my needs. I don’t want one, I drive long distances, and I don’t want the anxiety of having to charge it away from home. 

I found two cars that I liked and went to test drive both of them. I felt like I found my new car, and was excited to move forward. My husband gave me this long speech about how he wanted to buy the car for me, and how I didn’t get a fancy engagement ring, or wedding ring, and how he wanted to do this for me. He told me I could get whatever car I wanted, including one of these two vehicles.  Neither are flashy. But both fit my needs and have those extra features I want. We are not talking about luxury cars. After the test drive we talked at home, and both decided on which of the two cars we should get. We were going back to the dealership the next day to test drive it again and move forward.

The day of the test drive my husband calls me and says that he made an appointment (same time as the test drive) for us to test drive an EV. A Chevy Bolt. He said he always wanted to test drive an EV and that I should go and be open minded. I obliged, and went on the test drive. I did not like the car at all, and the storage space was not what I need. It’s a very small vehicle compared to what I am used to driving. My husband was very excited. And when I expressed my dislike for the car he told me that I was behaving like a spoiled teenager.

92,1dbug9g,"AITA for asking my mom to get a WFH job as an experienced legal secretary to help watch my son as a single, broke mom (deadbeat dad) ","Gonna make this quick as I'm now desperately applying to jobs. To give some context, my mother is someone who talks but doesn't act. My whole pregnancy, knowing the father walked out on my son and I, my mother would say things like, ""I'll do anything for you guys; You will always have me."" Yet when I need her to follow through, she makes every excuse. 
 Before I begin, she IS paying my rent. The alternative is homelessness... Before anyone asks, my parents live in a one bedroom apartment. Before I was pregnant, I was sleeping in their living room. 
Now- my mother has 20+ years experience as a legal secretary. She can get any job she wants in the country. So I asked her, hey mom, WFH jobs are super popular right now, and I know you would be able to get a WFH job at the same pay rate or better if you applied considering your experience, would you do that for me so I can start working again to provide for my son?
Her response- “I never asked my mom to quit her job. Get a job at the supermarket. We can watch your son from 5-11.”
So not only is she telling me, hey miss out on bathing your 3 month old son and putting him to sleep every night, work at a supermarket til midnight which isn't safe for you because I am stubborn.
Note- she commutes by train to work an hour away, so her train ticket costs her $200 a month before tax. She buys lunch out in an expensive city every day, and buys snacks on her way home. She often buys dinner too because she gets home late. So working from home would seriously save her a pretty penny.
Another note- she says they can watch my son from 5-11, yet she doesn't get home until 6:30/7 because of her walk to the train, then hour train ride. My dad picks her up from said train, so.... who is going to hire someone who can only work 7-11 every shift and has no flexibility?
I sent her some scathing texts out of frustration because she constantly compares her life to mine. My father was around to raise my sister and I, and he paid most of the bills growing up. My mom never had to pay rent and was able to be a SAHM until my sister and I were of school age. Only then did she go back to work. I simply do not have that. Childcare is so beyond expensive I would have to be working 40 hours a week to afford it and based on my mom's proposed work for 4 hours schedule, I would never meet 40 hours. Babysitters want $25/hour which is literally how much money I make. why would I go to work to only earn as much as it costs to pay someone to watch my child?
THEN both my parents have been discouraging me from seeking child support. Meanwhile I have bills I'm paying with my credit card because I have not worked in 3 months.  They say I can do it on my own but have never once a day in their life raised a child financially on their own.

My newborn hasn’t been sleeping much, and I’ve been only breastfeeding. One day, I was completely exhausted and decided to take a nap, leaving my newborn with my MIL for a few hours. When I woke up, I found my MIL asleep. I checked the fridge and noticed all the breast milk I had pumped was still there.

I asked her about it, and she told me she thought my breast milk was causing the baby’s sleeplessness because of my stress, so she decided to give her formula instead. I was furious. I’ve been very clear about wanting to exclusively breastfeed, and she knows this. She disregarded my wishes and made a significant decision about my baby’s feeding without talking to me. In my anger, I kicked her out of the house. My husband has been supportive about this and has accepted this.

This is the only reason I feel like I might be the AH. I don’t want my feelings to prevent my daughter from having a relationship with her grandmother. And I feel like the AH for putting my husband in between this whole thing.

About 2 weeks ago his car broke down and so for the time being he was using my car. Me and my brother both live with our parents. And when we take then around anywhere we never charge them. For the time my brother was using my car he wasted petrol and so my mum told him to put petrol. So he did. When he came back he asked me to pay him back. I told him I would only be paying half considering he has been driving my car and also that he acc drove it more than I did. He said this was unfair as he didn't use the car for his own gain and was driving our mother around and younger siblings. I said to him when his car works he doesnt charge mum so why is he charging me for using my car when I'm paying for half as well as full insurance and road tax etc. All I am asking for is half of my petrol that he has been using. He goes on to claim I am stingy not to mention my whole family is siding with him. Listen I understand that he wasn't using the car for his own gain. But when he is behind the wheel driving my car so he can do favours for my family why should I pay for it. Considering as well he actually drove my car way more  than I did. Am I the asshole because at the minute I'm not talking to him or my family as I feel incredibly wronged. They want me to apologise to him. I cant apologise unless I feel that I am wrong. Why would I admit something I don't feel that I did wrong.

95,1dbu0xk,AITA for lashing out at my neighbor and her friend?,"I recently moved out of the apartment I had been living in with my mother but she still lives there.

When we first moved in, we were told that the walls are quite thin, as the building is old, but we didn't mind because the neighbors right above us were an elderly couple. They eventually had to move out.

And then, a young girl moved in by herself. We'll call her Stacy.

It all started when a friend of Stacy's moved in. She would talk loudly, thump all over the apartment at any time of day and night, slam all doors (yes, the walls are really **that** thin) and especially the front one. When lockdown rules were that you could not have more than two visitors at a time, she held a party with at least 10 people that kept going up and down the stairs up until the late hours of the night. She would listen to music on loud every weekend at first, then on weekdays and eventually it got to where it was almost every day. 

Once every few months there would be someone else that would be staying over at Stacy's place. I've never seen the same face come back. They are going in and out at every waking hour, especially during the night, stomping down the stairs as they come and go, often bringing their own friends with them so that there are always at least 2-3 people galloping up and down and over the apartment. It's gotten to the point where this happens mostly after 10:30pm and goes on until 3-4am. It's been countless times that both my mom (light sleeper) and I (heavy sleeper) have been woken up in the middle of the night by them. They also rang our intercom by accident while coming home drunk a few times.

She's more confrontational than me so she tried talking with Stacy with no results. She also talked with the landlord and was eventually told that there's nothing they can do other than send her written notifications. Obviously this just frustrated us even more.

A few days ago I visited my mom. I had to wake up very early the next day (a work day) and was woken up once Stacy and one of her friends slammed the apartment door and galloped down the stairs at 12am. Making this the third night that my mom was woken up because of Stacy and/or her friends and also knowing that I'd have to wake up early, she went out in the hallway and called them out as they were leaving. She began scolding Stacy for the countless times this has happened, so her friend told my mom to leave Stacy alone. My mom just responded that it was none of her business since she didn't live there and to ""screw off"".

A few days later, my mom got a letter in the mail from the landlord. The letter basically said that it is known to them that the walls are thin but that the inhabitants and their visitors are allowed to come and go at any time they please and those are no reasons to **harass** neighbors over. They also demanded my mom to refrain from any further complaints and from ""disturbing the peace"".

98,1dbt26i,WIBTA if I tell a coworker to stop coughing and wheezing?,"A little backstory here to set the stage. I work in a call center, the nature of which is of little import, but just imagine an office space that's a medium length hallway with cubicles lining both long walls. As such, you can hear anything your neighbor says, or does. While it's ok to hear some of what your neighbor is doing, it's imperative that everyone keep their personal chatter to a minimum, speak softly while on the phone with a customer and *NOT* yell, and otherwise keep down unnecessary noise, like from cellular phones and the like. We actually get e-mails from our director a lot when she feels we're being too loud. Keep this in mind.

I have a coworker that sits on the exact opposite end of the office from where I'm sitting (at the other end of the ""hall"" on the opposite side wall) that I shouldn't be able to hear, at least in theory. Here's where the problem in the title comes in. From what I understand, this coworker has horrible asthma which only gets worse during high particulate days or seasons with excessive pollen. Because of this, he constantly, and I do mean **constantly**, wheezes, coughs, and clears his throat in order to find relief. Despite his distance from my cubicle, I can hear him clear as a bell. What he'll do is wheeze for a while with every breath, cough a single dry cough, then clear his throat in a rolling and guttural manner. This is simply a description of his behavior, nothing more. While his wheezing is quiet enough for me not to hear most of the time, the single cough and throat clearing is loud and clearly heard every time. Some days are better than others, but I would say he experiences this issue multiple times a week on average with little long-term downtime. This also worse when he gets up from his desk, walks over to talk to a member of his team that sits closer to me, and stands there talking to them for a while, struggling all the while. This has been going on for years.

So, WIBTAH if I confront him about this and ask him to seek medical attention to treat or curtail these symptoms? I find myself annoyed to a high degree when I have to sit and listen to him cough and clear his throat and cough for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I find it rude and inconsiderate to work in a call center and have a problem that causes this much noise for the people around you, not to mention the customers. I've heard him talking on the phone with customers while still wheezing and coughing. It must be jarring and awkward for them to deal with.

I'm at the end of my rope. I can't concentrate on my work and get more and more annoyed as the day goes on as I hear more and more of his coughing and throat clearing. I've asked around the office to a few people I trust won't blab to him or my bosses, but they seem to not notice or not be bothered by the constant noise. I seem to be on a lonely island here and the only one bothered by it. I know he can't help it, but it's just too much. So this is the question I pose.

I listed the tickets on StubHub and they sold pretty much immediately. I think he’s right that I probably should’ve asked him if it was OK first, but I also exhausted Literally every other option it’s not like my guy friend was the first person I asked.

It was the main group activity. We would all hang out separately obviously but that’s the thing we did together. 

Here’s where I might be the asshole.

While scrolling through snapchat stories I saw that 3 of the members of the group went to bingo without the rest of us. I messaged the group and ask them why they went when we said we would wait for the entire group and my best friend said they went because her sister could go (she didn’t go last time because she didn’t want to drive to bingo so we went without her with her permission)

I am also upset because bingo was our one activity together, so it hurt seeing them go without the rest of us and not maybe say “hey we know you guys can’t go, but we are gonna still go” just as a heads up. I don’t like finding out things through a snapchat story. 

This group was our way of setting time aside to go out once a week to bingo as an entire group, that’s the whole reason of starting the group.

My classmate hasn’t studied once in the span of 5 months and made it very clear that she thinks it’s unnecessary. 

Few days ago she finally said she would like to study together which I was fine with, come to find out she “forgot” her laptop and she would like to sit together and see my notes.
After reading half of the document, she asked if I can send it to her and I already knew she was gonna say that.
I wasn’t very keen on the idea, because she never cared to study and would always make fun of me for doing so.
So I simply said “I would like to keep the notes for myself, I don’t even know if anything is correct and I also worked hard to find all this info”

She got offended and after some arguments back and forth where she called me an egoist and pressed me to send the document over and over again, I simply gave up and just send it to her.

I (24 F) and my classmate (28 F) have been in school practice at a hospital for the past 5 months. Next week is our exam, so I have been studying for the past few weeks to make sure that I don’t fail. My classmate hasn’t studied once in the span of 5 months and made it very clear that she thinks it’s unnecessary. 

Few days ago she finally said she would like to study together which I was fine with, come to find out she “forgot” her laptop and she would like to sit together and see my notes.
After reading half of the document, she asked if I can send it to her and I already knew she was gonna say that.
I wasn’t very keen on the idea, because she never cared to study and would always make fun of me for doing so.
So I simply said “I would like to keep the notes for myself, I don’t even know if anything is correct and I also worked hard to find all this info”

She got offended and after some arguments back and forth where she called me an egoist and pressed me to send the document over and over again, I simply gave up and just send it to her.

102,1dbs1ez,AITA for spending half my lunchbreak outside?,"English is not my first language, so sorry for mistakes.

I (19F) am a allrounded hairdresser. I have a coworker (18M), let's call him Student.

Student thinks he doesn't have to clean, can just be on his phone all day and talk back to everyone with exception of my boss, bc he believes that she is the only one in de salon that outranks him.

Student leaves stuff specificly for me to clean up. I have had over 20 fights with him about this in 3 months, but get sick of constant arguing, as he won't do it. So I do the cleaning. Even on very busy days when I am fully booked, I do all the cleaning.

My boss has had weekly talks with Student about his behavior, especially towards me and already told him that she is not going to renew his contract, but his contract ending is still months away.

During my lunchtime a lot of people walk in to make an appointment or they call.  
Our lunchbreaks are in 2 shifts. The shifts overlap with half an hour and we get an hour lunchtime. Student and my other coworkers start their lunchbreak on the first shift, boss and I start at the second.

Student thinks that I am the one that has to stand up, help those costumers and pick up the phone everytime.  
My other coworkers feel like Student has to do all that during lunch, so they refuse to do any of the work as well, because ""if we do it, he will never do it"".

Here is where I might be TA:

I have decided that on the first half of my lunchbreak, I am going outside until my coworker's lunchbreak is over. On my second half of lunch, I will come back and eat my food. If there is work I don't have to do it, because their break is over.  
My coworkers have expressed that they don't like what I am doing, because they will have to argue with Student that he has to do work or do it themselves, because it adds to their workload.

I have explained that I can't keep doing more then 2 people's job and that I also deserve my lunchbreak and if I can't get that by talking/arguing, I will take reprecussions.

They understand where I am coming from, but they still don't like it and want me to stop, which I refuse, because I feel like I am dying of exhaustion after every work day.

I don't want to quit, bc I love my job, but some things just need to change.

103,1dbrv7s,AITA for leaving the house unannounced when my parents started fighting with my half brothers?,"Last Sunday was my dad's birthday and my parents and I (16f) were celebrating with my half brothers, who are dad's sons from his first marriage, and their wives and kids. My half brothers are both in their early 30s. So the fight started because one of my dad's grandkids called my mom by her first name and then pointed at an old family photo of my dad and his first wife with my half brother's and called her ""gamma"" and she was waving at my half brother's mom in the photo.

For whatever reason it only clicked with my parents then that my half brother's kids use mom's first name for her and never call her grandma. I always noticed. They only use my name too while my other half brother gets called Uncle Name. This started a fight where dad asked why mom was only her name and not grandma name and how come a 3 year old doesn't even call her grandma when she's young enough to naturally call mom grandma.

My half brother's said my mom isn't their grandma and they never claimed she was. Things started to get really intense from there with my parents and I tried leaving the room but I could still hear the fight. So then I left the house for a couple of hours and when I came back my half brothers and their families were gone and my parents were mad that I'd left unannounced. 

I told my parents I hadn't wanted to get caught up in the fight. My dad told me I should have stayed and supported mom because imagine how difficult that fight was for her. They also said I didn't seem surprised or upset and I said I never heard the kids call her grandma and I was never aunt either so it didn't come as a surprise.

They told me this was more of a reason to stay and be supportive and stand up for what's right and how cruel my half brother's are being in treating us that way. I pointed out how they were never close to me or mom but I got shut down. My parents lectured me about how wrong I was to leave like I did.

104,1dbro59,AITA for telling my spouse that they're insecure?,"Ive been struggling with my weight for a while and have tried dieting on and off, but have never been motivated to stick to it.

Lately, me and my spouse have moved back to my hometown and I have had access to amazing medical care, all my friends, and some nostalgic places. With all of this, and access to medications for my autoimmune disorders, I have felt better than ever and more motivated to finally cut junk from my diet and start exercising more. This has never gone well in the past, but I've actually gotten to the point where I don't crave the junk food anymore and refuse to buy it, and have even already lost 10 lbs. I'm so happy to have gotten past the initial hurdle when it comes to eating more wholesome foods.

However, my spouse asked why I was dieting again. I laughed nervously and told them, honestly, I just really wanted to be able to fit into the rides at the theme park.
They seemed horrified for some reason and told me that it was an extremely unhealthy reason to want to lose weight. I got upset and told them that it wasnt just that. I wanted to be more active and social overall.

I told them I was tired of leaning on my chronic pain and fatigue and not being able to enjoy physical activities with my dearest friends. During the eclipse, I had to miss out on an amazing hike and me and my spouse stayed behind. They told me that I shouldn't want to lose weight like that because it wouldn't make me any less disabled and I was delusional for thinking I would get better and falling into a societal beauty standards trap. I was making an unhealthy choice.

They also told me that I was incredibly preachy whenever I started dieting. I'm not trying to be. Nutrition science just happens to be something that absolutely fascinates me and I LOVE researching and talking about it. I could do it for hours. And spill all of my opinions on the food industry and nutrition and whatnot. I just find it very fulfilling. I had no idea that I was being preachy. However, my feelings were hurt at that point. And I do admit that I told them that in probably a less than sensitive way.

I said that just because they are insecure about their own disabilities, they shouldn't project onto me and drag me down with them. That I don't have to eat the same junk they do and I am allowed to make my own choices as for what to do about MY body.
I apologized for sounding preachy, and explained what I did above. But that I would not be sorry for using whatever made me happy to stay motivated and to have the hope that losing some weight will help at least a little with my disabilities.

105,1dbrcgn,AITA for telling another parent they're wrong to blame my daughter and expect too much of me when their kid is in my home?,"My daughter Arya (13f) has been best friends with Lilah (13f) since they went to the same preschool together. They're always spending time together and have a bigger group of friends but know each other the longest and are the closest with each other. Lilah's family situation is a little difficult. And her mom went a little crazy on me last week which led to a conflict.

To sum up the current problem. Lilah has a blended family. It's her mom, her stepdad, some stepsiblings and some half siblings. Lilah has expressed that she doesn't feel close to them, she always emphasizes that she has no real siblings and that even her half siblings are just half siblings and they're not her dad's kids too. I have heard her tell Arya how much it bugs her when people say her step and half siblings are just siblings. But they don't talk about it too often.

Lilah's mother showed up at my house last week and blamed Arya for Lilah's use of the step and half terms. She said she heard the girls talk about it and them say step and half siblings aren't real siblings. She said she knows that must have come from Arya because she has been fighting Lilah for years to stop saying step and half. I asked her how that even made sense. She told me Arya must be the source and I told her Lilah says that whether Arya is around or not and she's wrong to blame Arya for how Lilah feels. 

Lilah's mother then told me I should be watching over the girls whenever they're in my home or my presence and correcting Lilah whenever she uses step, half, or says they're not her real family. I told Lilah's mother she couldn't seriously expect me to listen to them 24/7 so I can correct Lilah and it's too much for her to expect me to do when her kid is over to play with mine.

She was not happy with me at all. She told me I can't say Arya isn't to blame and in the same breath refuse to correct Lilah when she says something wrong. She told me I just want to let them away with saying stuff and I don't do enough for Lilah, even though Lilah spends more time at my house than she does her own. In the same breath Lilah's mother said her husband is so sick of Lilah refusing to cooperate there and she needs to be here more so I can correct her.

I told her she really is expecting too much. She told me I was a bitch and a shitty person.

So I (M19) have been volunteering at a care  club near my local town, a club I used to be a part of, during my time there, I managed to find a few friends and often after the sessions were over, we would go out for a meal as a group. 

Soon enough, I would fall into a relationship with one of those friends and we would end up dating for a couple of months, everything was going well. But then around Easter, this friend ended things by engaging with another person, and telling me we were not comparable. I was devastated by this but resigned myself to be civil with my ex, being kind and often checking in like I do with my other mates.

But recently things had gotten worse as around two weeks ago, during a quiz that the club was running, my ex decided to bring their new boyfriend to that quiz, despite knowing that me and my family was going to be there and even though I kept a solid face, it tore me up inside as despite everything I still cared for my ex. Things  began to fall apart, especially as one of the other friends within the group began to fall out with my ex and another friend. Ultimately the group was beginning to split in two, which me and my exs friend didn’t want to happen.

So we arrive to the most recent club session and things were going well, until a smoke break where I hear my ex and the friend speak about picking up their boyfriend from the station, to go and have a meal with our group after the session. Once again I felt shaken as i realised that my ex was once again bringing their new boyfriend to an event despite knowing I would be there, and my feelings on the matter. But me and one of the friends still decided to go as I had hoped what I had heard might’ve been relating to something else, sure enough, I was wrong. Upon seeing the new boyfriend and my ex, me and the other friend decided to leave.

I refused, saying Jack's happiness was the priority and that it wasn't fair to force gender stereotypes on him.

To make matters worse, my parents have taken sides. My mother thinks I should respect my brother's wishes and return the dollhouse, while my father supports me, saying that Jack's interests should be nurtured regardless of gender norms.

111,1dbovrd,AITA for for cutting off my best friend for choosing my ex,"for context i (F19) and my now ex boyfriend (M20) broke up about 8 months ago. 
my ex, let’s call him tony, broke up with me very abruptly after a 2 year relationship due to commitment issues and feeling the need to be more independent and kicked me out of his house without much more of an explanation.
my best friend (F20), we’ll call her bella, and i have been friends since middle school and she’s only known tony since he and i started dating.  
We hung out the three of us on multiple occasions but as far as i’m aware they never hung out just the two of them.
When the breakup happened, she didn’t want to choose sides and stayed friends with the both of us.. although she and i have not seen each other in at least 4 months and it seems every few days there’s a new story on social media of them hanging out. they have even gone on multiple weekend trips together which i find rather odd and i’ve started to wonder if it’s become more than just friendship. But she has denied this when asked. 
i slowly have stopped speaking to her although i have not confronted the situation, and feel like maybe i’m overreacting and reading into things… AITA?

113,1dbnnc5,AITA for leaving my competitive jump rope team for a better one?,"I (17m) am a competitive jump rope athlete on the international level. I compete with my current jump rope team as of now and will finish out the season with them this year. Next year, however, I would like to compete with a different jump rope team as I feel their jump ropers are more skilled and I feel it would give me a better chance at qualifying for the world championships and doing well at the world championships.

The problem with this is that next year I will be a senior in high school. The seniors on the team are tasked with the responsibility of running practice and coaching younger team members. We do this because jump rope is such a new sport that pretty much no jump rope team is fortunate enough to have a coach with past jump rope experience. So older team members actually coach while our “coach” is more of an adult overseer and handles logistical things for the team.

I would also like to compete for this different team because I feel the people left on my current team aren’t as up to par as I would like them to be. To put it bluntly I feel they might hold me back from what I could accomplish(not intentionally, just because of the difference in skill level). I also feel that the people left on my current team I don’t have a good connection with. I feel if I stayed I might be left without a friend as all my good friends graduated in years prior or are graduating this year.

I have talked this over with the new team and they are welcoming me with open arms. I have made arrangements to finish out high school online and my parents and I are currently in the process of finding an apartment(which I will pay for) near the new team so I can practice with them on a consistent bases. I have also mentioned this to my current coach and she isn’t thrilled with the idea. Luckily we have a good relationship and she didn’t seem completely opposed to the idea either. I said I would try my best to come back and coach as I owe that to the team. I was thinking once a week possibly as the drive is only 2 hours away. But that is way less than I could contribute if I did stay and nothing I promised was guaranteed as I don’t know what my availability would be. She said she would like some time to think it over. Ultimately, my coaches opinion doesn’t matter and I will still probably go through with this no matter what. Despite this, it would still be nice to have her blessing.

I feel a little guilty as I will kind of be dodging my responsibilities as a senior. I have been on the team since I was 8 years old and they have really shaped me into the person I am today. However, I still want myself to be as successful as possible, even if that does mean cutting ties and leaving my team behind. But what do you think?

It’s a lot for me considering I’m only an every other day kind of person. Well at that point I’ve had it. I can’t live with someone like that any longer. The very next day, he came out the bathroom after already going twice that day. I told him that he either needs to change his diet, or go see a doctor about this because this is not normal. He was shunned and he started to get emotional. He exclaimed that he has IBS and anxiety that influences his bowels, and he can’t help it. He also said that it’s normal and regular for his family.

I made a fair bit of money a long time ago and I basically retired very young. I tried being a trust fund douche bag but I wasn't cut out for it. I worked hard to get my money and I wasn't raised wealthy. I was just very lucky during the dotcom boom. 

I have three children and three nephews, on niece. I am doing my best not to brag about them. So I will say this. They took my money and time and used it to make amazing things happen for them. 

And I celebrate their achievements. Both scholastic and athletic. I throw parties for them and I give them great presents. 

My son is jealous because I do not have parties for his achievements. 

He is a great kid and quite smart. He isn't a natural athlete but neither am I by any stretch of the imagination. He dies well in school but I know that I will be paying out of pocket for him to attend whatever school he gets into. 

I also host parties for him and his friends. I just don't celebrate him as much. 

He had complained about this. So last week I asked him what achievement he wants to celebrate. 

I shit you not his answer was that he had maxed out his fishing stat in Final Fantasy 14. 

I know all those words. I even know that game. What I do not get is how a fifteen year old kid thinks that is on the same level as getting scouted for a Div 1 athletic scholarship. 

I said he could have a party but that I wasn't sending out invites with that as the reason. 

He is upset and my wife thinks I'm being judgmental. Which I am. I am judging him. And wondering where the hell I went wrong.

I'll answer a couple  of questions I know will be asked. 

Yes I love my son very much. 

Yes he is on the spectrum. 

No I don't think that is worth celebrating. 

No I cannot bring myself to celebrate that.

120,1dbmju9,AITA for not letting my brother be my best man?,"As the title says, I have no desire to make my brother my best man at my wedding. I know “traditionally” that’s what you’re supposed to do, and my parents are both insistent that I do so and that it would be an insult not to, but here are my reasons for not doing so:

1. He is horrible to, well everyone, but especially to my fiancé. He has severe anger issues that get set off for no particular reason, where he starts yelling at everyone telling them all the reasons he hates them/they’re stupid/he’s superior, etc. However, with her it’s especially bad. He hates her, even though she is incredibly nice to him and goes out of her way to do him favors and kind gestures. 

2. Relating to reason number one, he’s treated me terribly his whole life. He makes it no secret that he despises everyone, but because I’m the only one who stands up to his bullying he hates me especially. The rest of my family is content with “he just came that way!” but I strongly believe he’s only gotten worse as he’s gotten older because my parents bend to his every whim, all he needs to do is start yelling and throw a tantrum, enabling the behavior. The way I see it, your best man should be someone you have a good relationship with, not someone who hates you just for existing in the same house. 

If I had it my way, he wouldn’t come to the wedding at all. He’ll show up to find ways to get as much attention as humanly possible because he’s also a complete narcissist, but he won’t make my wedding any better by being there, for me or my fiancé, he’ll make it worse. 

Again, my parents insist I am in the wrong not to have him as my best man. Is this wedding tradition really so important and engrained that I’d be an asshole for not sticking to it?

EDIT: I truly didn’t expect such a widely unanimous answer here. From the outside looking in I guess it’s completely clear who’s in the right here, but as was maybe obvious my whole upbringing has been about appeasing the narcissists in my life (my mother and brother) and the consequences for not doing so were always severe, so such topics are not as obvious to me. 

You’re all very kind to take time out if your day to help me think through this logically without the pollution of my mothers guilt tripping or threat of my brothers adult meltdown. 

At this point I’m settled on not having him as my best man, or being in my wedding party. I’m also considering not inviting him at all. My hang up on that is my hope to minimize drama, not just at the wedding but after. If I don’t invite him, my mother will spend the entire wedding telling people nonsense about why I am, indeed, an asshole for not inviting him and that “he’s really sweet now. Oh he’s not like that anymore, it’s been so long since you’ve seen him he’s grown up. OP is just a crybaby and drama queen who wanted to make a point since they’re so different!”

Now the solution to that is clear: just don’t invite mom either. My worry there is that I’ll never hear the end of it from extended family and family friends who are going, and it’ll be the topic of gossip and a whole god damn thing. She of course would never forgive me, and that would be the end of our relationship as well, which is not what I want. 

So right now I’m thinking I’ll put him in the back, and let the bar know to limit his drinks because, shocker, alcohol makes him way worse. 

My real wedding party will have multiple veterans, recently retired, so they can more than handle throwing his ass out should the need arise. In my mind, while this will also be dramatic and create a scene, everyone will be forced to see his behavior firsthand, instead of my mothers version which will paint me as the asshole and him as the angel. This will both get him out of the wedding and prevent him not being there from being the focus of the day, instead of my bride, AND no one can say I didn’t give him a chance. Also, if he turns out to actually behave himself and shut up (maybe a 15-20% chance,) then that’s cool too. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-09,"AITA for not letting my brother be my best man?

I decided not to tell my mom as they were broken up and I didn’t want to hurt my mother.  A couple days later she is at his house again when I arrived for work and the rudeness continued.

124,1dbmdb0,AITA for calling my coworker a bully after he made a big deal over a small mistake I made? ,"I (23F) started working at a psych ward 3m ago. And since the 1st or 2nd week I began working my (40s M) coworker was giving me trouble. He would try to make fun of me with other coworkers (they would not comply), create rumors about me, complain about me to others, try to turn other coworkers against me, ignore me whenever I would talk to him about job related things, make me clean the poop of the patients (he never does it), try to convince my other coworkers that I’m bad.
I would ignore him but I would tell my coworkers the situation. They agreed because everyone have noticed this. Also, at my job people say that he acts this way because he is short and I would laugh about it which I think was my mistake (this only because he has been “bullying me”)

These past few days I’ve tried to stand up for myself instead of ignoring him because he is driving me to my limit. 
But it got worst a few days ago. I was assigned to take the patients to the cafeteria. When asked how many patients were going down, I stated 9, instead of 7 since I did not double-check that the new patient was already in the system and I thought the second new admission was arriving around noon or lunchtime, so I ordered two extra trays of food. As I returned to the unit, I encountered a disproportionally frustrated coworker. His frustration was accompanied by angry and annoyed gestures -nodding his head, making audibly annoyed sounds- and words of complaint and disapproval that he was repeating in front of other patients. The complaints and the frustration continued even after the cafeteria employees were aware of the situation. I decided to respond in the best way possible which was to tell him that it was not a big deal. He aggravated the situation angrily raising his voice asking me in a threatening manner to not talk to him. After that, he  began cussing me out w the secretary, claiming that 'it was not him but me' and that he was trying to 'be professional'. He proceeded to say that he was going to 'talk to them' ( the higher-ups), to which I responded that I was going to do the same. Then after saying a few more things to me I called him a bully.
He complained to the ANM and she said that I hurt his feelings when I called him a bully. Also, she said that according to him I “threatened him”. She proceeded to mention how of a great worker he is and that he has been there a long time.  Likewise, she said that we both were in the “wrong” and that other coworkers complained about me because apparently I’ve called him a bully many times in front other patients (this is not true). I ended up staying overtime to write a letter about the situation to tell me side. 
My coworkers told me that they were on my side, and that they have seen how he treats me. I’ve also been praised about my great performance so now it feels it is a lie. or maybe it is just a few coworkers that have complained, who knows

Under the request of my dad’s older sister, my (27F) dad (62M) filed an immigrant visa petition for his younger sister and her family (husband, two kids) in ~2005. This means that he is the primary sponsor of this family and is financially and legally responsible for them for either ten years after arrival, until they become citizens (a huge responsibility essentially). The visa application/interview/retrieval process usually takes a while from UCSIC/NVC - Now in 2024, my dads/his sisters case gained some momentum in their case as they’re preparing for her family’s interview in a few months and their visas may be available as of end of 2024/early 2025 to emigrate to the US. 

In my household, it is my father, mother (61F with medical disability that limits her functioning to some degree), and I. My dads oldest sister/older brother(s) have throughout this visa process told my dad not to tell my mom/I about this because they knew we would have possible concerns with my dad making such a legal/financial commitment as well as them having to live with us. He’s maybe mentioned this once or twice to my mom in the last 19 years. He once wanted me to look something up re the case but he came into my room and was whispering and being vague so I could tell he was trying to keep this hush hush. My dad the other day now casually in passing drops the update to my mom and I that this visa process is moving forward and the sister/family may be able to arrive by end of this year or next year. He specifically stated that “he’s ONLY doing the paperwork and one of his brothers and sisters will house them and take care of the rest once they arrive.” I know his extended family will never house the family when my dad is legally on the line. I asked my dad to add his brothers or older sister as a joint sponsor and he escalated things by saying absolutely not and yelling at me for suggesting such an idea that would inconvenience his extended family. He would rather inconvenience and LIE TO his wife and children rather than set some boundaries with his extended family. He kept downplaying this situation by saying to us “this is such a simple matter. Why are you getting some worked up.” 

I feel so hurt and betrayed by my father because he is so quick to put the preferences and asks of others above his immediate family. At the end of the day I know if their visa gets approved that they will be living in our house despite my dad being adamant that they won’t. My mom and I were not made of aware of this sponsorship and therefore I believe we should certainly not have to deal with them moving into the house if they do get approved to come here. 

Let me know your thoughts on if I’m overreacting or not.

127,1dbm89z,AITA for politely declining a large financial gift from a struggling immigrant parent? ,"Tldr: I refused a significant no-strings-attached financial gift from a parent who wanted to create an opportunity for me to relax and heal burn out, but I refused because I knew this parent was historically bad with money and had been struggling financially my entire life and now they think I'm ungrateful and disrespectful. Am I the asshole (or bad daughter) for not accepting their gift?

---

Okay, so my mother raised me alone after my dead beat dad left us with an effed up mortgage, a broken down house, and tons of thousands of dollars in debt when I started high school. She had to work 3 jobs and I barely saw her at all throughout high school. I practically raised myself. I worked my ass off to make her proud of her ""investment"" in me, got myself into an ivy league school, and am now slogging it on my PhD to try for a career in academia and research. I also worked 2-3 jobs on the side to pay for grad school, so you know, apple didnt fall far from the tree. 

She offered recently to give me $2,000 for a vacation, stating she saved enough and wants me to have so I don't have to worry about money because Ive been so stressed and could use the time off to heal from severe burn out. The problem is, she's been in a similar situation for as long as I remember and could use the money for retirement, house repairs, or debt. She doesn't know I know she's in hundreds of thousands dollars in debt and is still struggling with the house payments and is in severe burn out herself. It's obvious to me and to everyone around her she can't make ends meet and is still working 2-3 jobs, and frankly I still carry childhood trauma and think it's my fault she's struggling this much. It made me deeply uncomfortable to accept and told her so. She got incredibly pushy, which made me put my foot down more because she wasn't listening and I told her outright I was worried she would have nothing for retirement if I accepted. She's now super angry and now I feel guilty for saying no. 

Am I the asshole for being concerned about my mom's financial health? Or should I have said yes and just let her?

129,1dblzd2,AITA for only buying myself steak?,"For context, I (M17) live with my mom(60 y.o) and my sister (21 y.o) because my dad died 4 years ago. Now, here comes the argument of the day which my mom got mad at me for. This morning, after coming back from the gym, i set off to a local market to buy myself some steak, thyme, rosemary, amd whatnot because i wanted to try practicing to make steak.

When my mom asked where i was going, i told her that i was going to the market to buy myself some steak because i wanted to practice it. I admit that my wording could be misinterpeted in the coming argument, but that gives no right to my mother (in my opinion) to consistently ignore and reject my attempts at finding a middleground between us.

In short, the argument was about me buying steak with the plan of making just myself some steak as opposed to the whole family. Now, i thought i was clear when i told her that the steak was for myself when i was off to the market, but i guess not.

Nevertheless, i acknowledged my mistake in wording and told her, calmly -while she shouted at me, called me retarded, greedy, and a bitch- that i would be willing to buy her and my sister steaks when coming back from work in the morning so i could cook all three at once.

Despite my efforts, she kept berating and yelling at me without stop, to the point i got bored of it so i blew her off and went into my bedroom.

TL;DR: i bought steak for myself, my mom got angry it was just for myself, i tried to tell her that i would buy steak for her and my sister in the morning, she was still angry at me abd kept yelling at and berating me despite this.

130,1dblmdm,AITA for not diffusing an argument between my two friends?,"I have two friends that I am extremely close with, Lila and Peter. Lila is someone I grew up with, but we just recently got close again as adults. I've had a more consistent friendship with Peter, who I met online. We have a group chat full of other people, both people we known in person and people we've met online.

For some context, Lila and Peter do not get along. They already have had bad blood before this argument. She had done something to make him extremely uncomfortable and since then, they've barely talked. However, every now and then Lila will have sudden bursts of anger where she would talk shit about Peter to me. In most cases, I have defended Peter which only upsets Lila even more. I think she also gets upset about how close I am with him.

Peter lives in a different continent. There is a slur there that is used against his people that is not a big deal where we live. However, Peter has expressed that this slur deeply upsets him and regardless of the cultural differences between our two countries, he would at least prefer we don't say it around him. He had to have discussions with people in the group chat, including Lila.

Recently, in the group chat, Lila texts the slur. I was the first person to call her out, saying ""Peter is uncomfortable with that word."" She replies with, ""It's my new stim."" Peter was extremely upset and in the middle of trying to educate her, he did drop a few F-bombs and other swear words, but never called her any names. However, Lila defended her saying that word, saying she didn't mean it like ""that."" Peter became increasingly upset as the argument went on and it ended with Lila apologizing and leaving the group chat.

Later on, Lila texted me and asked me why I did not try to diffuse the argument. I was confused and told her that I don't blame him for being frustrated with her especially when she dragged the argument for way too long. She basically told me that she expected me to diffuse the situation and she didn't appreciate getting cussed out. She said that he was being immature, but in the same breath, said ""I was being attacked so of course I got defensive.""

This is extremely paraphrased, but I said, ""Your actions have consequences. You already have beef with him, but you still crossed a boundary you knew he placed. If I was in his shoes, I would have responded the same way. You can't talk about maturity when your only reason to defending yourself saying a slur was because you didn't like the way you were being spoken to. You didn't even believe in your stance, argued just to argue, and that frustrated him more and I don't blame him.

Throughout our 2 year relationship, I have been (what I deem) heavily integrated in his schooling. He needed help with math hw, and since I got my bachelor's in math, it was natural for me to offer help. I do want to see him succeed. 

Over time, help with math grew into more. Helping with other subjects, taking online quizzes, making presentations, and even just being there (since he says he cannot focus when I am not there to keep him focused). I want to be fair and add, for the vast majority of this, I'm not just allowing him to cheat. I'm genuinely trying to teach him and he is genuinely trying to learn. We both live separate with family. So, doing day long study sessions isn't ideal when I have my own chores like laundry, cleaning, etc.

The level of involvement became too much for me to continuously provide. Due to other things in the relationship, we are somewhat in a limbo stage. And I expressed that I didn't think it would be a good idea to keep helping him during our ""break"". Which I swore he agreed to. 

However, as exams began to roll around, it became an issue. He says that I never asked to not help him. And that it's really disappointing that I didn't want to. He questions if me wanting him to succeed is genuine. And so I started helping him in ways I could and felt comfortable with. 

I just got a call from him, asking if I was coming over tonight to keep him company while he studies (for another subject). He pretty much didn't study at all today nor yesterday because I was not there. He also needs math help before an exam in 3 days (even tho I just helped him study for an exam 3 days ago). 

I said I might just stay home and get an early start tomorrow to give him a better chance of being able to help him study tomorrow. He asked if I can help him everyday until the exam. And I said, no...(I work a full time job). I can try 2 of the days. 

He said, you can just not help me and I'll fail. It got a little heated because I told him not to guilt trip me, it is adding stress on my plate. And he said I'm stressing myself out, bc his school is done in 3 days and then he will be on break for a full 2 months.

We all started hanging out and doing a bunch of stuff together. Near the end of 2018 i get the infamous “you up?” text from on of the guys in the friend group. He had a girlfriend at the time. Long story short him and i messed around for about 5 years on and off. During this time he still had his gf. I know im a bad person but i have since sat down with her and apologized to her face for all the things i did to her and she forgave me. Her and i are on good terms now. After her and i talked, me and (I’ll use fake names) Jake stopped speaking to each other (we had been talking that morning when i went to go speak to her and then she (let’s call her Ann) told him we were meeting so he blocked me). When Ann and I spoke this was in August of 2022. March of the next year rolls around and Jake pops up in my likes on a dating app called Hinge. After me and him having a very uncomfortable conversation we decided to meet up for a one night NSA (no strings attached) mess around. After that night we didn’t speak for about 3 weeks then he texted me out of the blue. We were trying to find a time when we could meet up again (we both live with our parents) and one night he was a little too drunk and was telling me that he had feelings for me, and that he didn’t want me going out on dates, and that i was his, and i know he doesn’t like to share me. I decided to block him after he said all of that because he would say that things to me back in the day and that made me catch feelings for him in the beginning. I unfortunately fell in love with him in the beginning of everything but definitely don’t anymore. About a week and a half after i block him, I see him walk into a brewery im hanging out at and he’s holding hands with a girl. He saw me. I saw him. And we both know we saw each other. At the time i was very mad because not 2 weeks prior he was telling me he had feelings for me and now he’s holding hands with some girl. Or so I thought. Later that night i did some investigating and turns out she (let’s call her Kate) and him had been dating for 6 months. So he cheated on this girlfriend with me. Again. And this time i had no idea. I told her the next day. I sent the hey girlie message on instagram and screenshots of Jake and I’s texts and from when he was in the dating app (he was on it 3 months into their relationship). But here’s the best part. Kate was another girl he would cheat on Ann with while he using me to cheat. So Kate got into a relationship with Jake after knowing he was cheating on Ann with her. So i send her the message and when i got to look at it like 30 minutes later, im blocked on Instagram. All of that happens on a Friday and Saturday. Monday rolls around and i get a DM from someone I don’t know and it’s Kate using her friends account. Turns out Jake had her Instagram on his phone and saw the message too. He was the one who blocked me. So me and Kate text back and forth for a bit then we talk on the phone for about 2 hours. She said she was going to leave him if everything i said was true. Well obviously that was a lie. They’re engaged now. Like just happened yesterday. I know many things about Kate including the fact that her dad is a pastor. I’ve done a lot of digging and i don’t think he has any social media so i can’t find him there. But Kate’s mom has facebook and instagram.

But here’s the best part. Kate was another girl he would cheat on Ann with while he using me to cheat. So Kate got into a relationship with Jake after knowing he was cheating on Ann with her. So i send her the message and when i got to look at it like 30 minutes later, im blocked on Instagram. All of that happens on a Friday and Saturday. Monday rolls around and i get a DM from someone I don’t know and it’s Kate using her friends account. Turns out Jake had her Instagram on his phone and saw the message too. He was the one who blocked me. So me and Kate text back and forth for a bit then we talk on the phone for about 2 hours. She said she was going to leave him if everything i said was true. Well obviously that was a lie. They’re engaged now. Like just happened yesterday. I know many things about Kate including the fact that her dad is a pastor. I’ve done a lot of digging and i don’t think he has any social media so i can’t find him there. But Kate’s mom has facebook and instagram. So WIBTA if i told her mom that Jake cheated literally a year ago and is a serial cheater and will probably cheat on her throughout their whole relationship? ",,1.006744384765625,1,0

135,1dbl4w9,AITA for giving my friend the honest truth about her boyfriend?,"Me (26F), my friend (June, 24F), her boyfriend (Lester, early 30's, M). June is on a Visa here and has been in Aus for \~4 years now, but is moving back home. We've been friends for 3.5 years.

I won't go into details here, but Lester has cheated on June, stolen money from her, and talks down to her and makes her feel stupid. I have seen a huge decline in her self-confidence and self-worth over the years, but she tell me he's all she's got. They've been together \~3 years and lived together for a while, but now she spends her time travelling the coast and staying in hotels, while he either stays in his share house or goes with her at her expense. He's never had a job so she pays for everything; she earns quite a lot. I do my best to remain supportive while also gently telling her that she doesn't need to settle for this.

I used to have more free time when I was at uni, but now I work full time and can't see her as often when she's in town. Whenever our schedules do line up, she always finds an excuse to cut it short so she can see him, but she won't tell me until we see each other.

We used to be extremely close but we've drifted apart over the last few years because of stuff like this. I have let it go for ages because I respect that it's her relationship and I know she doesn't see him much either.

Today, we had plans for her to visit my place for the first time since I moved here a year ago (she often stays in the city and I will visit her). I had bought us food for lunch and I was so busy yesterday making the house perfect; I was so excited. Then, at the last minute, she tells me she's going to the movies with him instead and can't make it. She then tries to reschedule for during the day tomorrow, I tell her I can't do that, then she realises we won't see each other before she moves back, and then tells me she's CHANGED HER FLIGHT so she can see me later in the week instead of just cancelling with Lester. It'll now be after work for 2 hours instead of a whole day together.

I replied and told her that she needs to stop ruining her life for this guy and stop spending all of her money just to make him happy. I said it's been 3 years and he has no plans to move with her back to her country, so why is she prioritising him?

She then replied saying she was heart broken and said I was a horrible person for saying what I said. She went on to say she's making the most of the time they have left together, and that Lester only had today free because he had plans with friends all week, and that I'm being selfish for wanting to see her instead of ""letting"" her see him. (She is moving and he waited last minute to make plans to say goodbye)

She is convinced he's going to move overseas and surprise her, and I feel bad for her because it's so obvious he isn't. I feel like she really needed to just come face to face with reality, but I'm beginning to think that hurting her feelings wasn't the best idea.

136,1dbl3uy,WIBTA for not giving up my spot to my GFs ex so that he can finally be involved in his kid's life?,"I (38m) am in a dilemma.

Some history. My girlfriend, K (39f), and her ex (40m) split when their daughter L (17f) was 4 years old. K has full custody and her ex has made very little effort to be a part of L's life in the last 13 years. In the last 10 years, L's dad hasn't even texted Merry Xmas, or happy birthday to L. Her sweet 16? Nothing. His family (parents and siblings) are always trying to see L and be involved in her life. He did improve a little recently for her recent birthday but has been radio silent for a few months.

I have been w/ K for almost 2 years. For L's upcoming senior year, she made captain for her color guard team. This means K and I will be volunteering and helping a lot. We pretty much have to dedicate 12 Saturdays to volunteering for the team.

With the upcoming season, L's dad wants to be more and wants to be a parent volunteer. The thing is, each student is only allowed 2 parent volunteers. The reason for this is because there's limited space at these competitions. It gets pretty crowded if you have ever been to one of these. So if L's dad wants to help, I have to give up my spot.

When K told me this, she knew it meant a lot to me to be involved. K wants me there with her, not with her ex. L is conflicted. She's very kind-hearted and doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. She knows her dad has been a deadbeat but you can't blame a teenage girl for wanting her dad around. The situation has made L stressed and anxious. She asked if we could take care of it and will be fine with whatever we decide. K has never prevented her ex from being involved with L so she also doesn't want to make it seem like her ex can't see L by telling him he can't help. K is leaning on telling him to attend the competitions and be in the audience. K asked me what I wanted to do and my thoughts on the whole thing.

I don't want to. I think it's crap that it took this guy 10 years to finally realize he's neglected his kid for the last 10+ years. Ever since I have been with K, I have been to all but 2 of L's competitions. L's dad has been to one. Not one a year, just ONE. L has been doing color guard throughout all of high school.

I plan to be with K for the rest of my life and that means being in L's life too. I don't see L as ""my GFs daughter"", I see her as my own kid too sort of (I say sort of because I'm not actually a parent here) and I'd do anything for her. On the other hand, it seems like L's dad has finally come to his senses and wants to be more involved. It's his kid at the end of the day and I don't want to be an obstacle. So Reddit WIBTA?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the feedback folks. Something I added in the comments. We can't split time because all parent volunteers need to sign up w/ the school for 2 reasons (1) have parents sign a commitment because it's A LOT they can't have parents flaking.

Reason #3: I did care about him, truly. Even if it wasn’t romantic. I wanted to protect him and his feelings because I valued him over myself. I figured it wasn’t the end of the world for a while.

But then I told a ‘friend’ about this and they told me to just break up with him and that I was being manipulative for ‘using’ my boyfriend. I also had told this friend I got with my boyfriend after a recent breakup so they assumed I was using him to feel better. When that was blatantly not true.

But now I lost my friend over this. Even though they told me to break up with him.

I gave this friend so much advice and listened to their problems but the second have problems, they drop me. They told me that I reminded them of themselves.

140,1dbkf44,WIBTA for not letting my mom and her bf see my child at birth?,"For context, my (26f) mother (49f) has been with her current boyfriend (49m) since 2009. Let’s call him Bryan. Me and Bryan never hit off as I’ve always got weird vibes from him. The guy has 0 social cues and just doesn’t take time to use common sense. He obviously never liked me and I 100% can tell that he finds me annoying or whatever. The feelings are mutual on this one.

Last summer my mother opened a chip stand, and me, her and Bryan were the only employees. I waited for him in the rain (I couldn’t go back in since my boyfriend left with the apartment complex’s keys) and saw him drive by like 2 minutes after going out. I thought he was going to my apartment as it’s on the same road (me and bf have our own apartments but I stay more at his place than mine). I waited 5 minutes, nothing. My apartment was only a 2 minutes drive from where I was. He finally calls asking if I was home, I said that I was at my boyfriend’s & he said he was on his way. Another 5 minutes goes by, still not there. 10 minutes later he arrived, I’m soaked at this point and irritated. He tells me that he was parked playing Pokémon Go. I’m PoGo player too but damn, that pissed me off.

When we got there, my mom immediately read me and asked me what’s wrong and why I’m all wet. I told her I had to wait on Bryan for like nearly 20 minutes outside because he decided to go play Pokémon Go. She got upset at him and he started yelling saying he never took that long and that I was exaggerating. I called bullshit and he popped off, telling my mom the words that will always ring in the back of my mind: “I told you I never wanted her in my life!”

Ah yeah? Okay. If that's how you feel, go ahead. 

Anyways, I found out on Wednesday that I am pregnant and haven’t told my mother yet. I don’t really want to because when my little sister announced my mother her pregnancy, she begged her to not tell anyone. The second my sister left, she told nearly everyone that stopped by that she was going to be a grandmother again (my other sister has 4 kids).

When my little sister gave birth, it was a total mess. My mother told EVERYONE that it was “parents only, no siblings” although my sister is a whole adult herself. She tried her best to keep us away from the hospital and caused a whole scene when my two siblings still went with our biological father. I’m not a petty person, I just like to feed people their medicine. Do stupid shit, it’ll come back to you. And if anyone if wondering, yes she pulled similar shit with my older sister’s births.

I don’t really plan on telling her. I do however plan on telling her that I want my siblings there, and my biological father. I do not want her to cause a scene and have everyone on edge. I do not plan on letting Bryan near my child at all, or in my child’s life for all that matters. If he doesn’t want me in his life, why let him be in my child’s life?

WIBTA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-09,"WIBTA for not letting my mom and her bf see my child at birth? For context, my (26f) mother (49f) has been with her current boyfriend (49m) since 2009. Let’s call him Bryan. Me and Bryan never hit off as I’ve always got weird vibes from him. The guy has 0 social cues and just doesn’t take time to use common sense. He obviously never liked me and I 100% can tell that he finds me annoying or whatever. The feelings are mutual on this one.

Last summer my mother opened a chip stand, and me, her and Bryan were the only employees. I waited for him in the rain (I couldn’t go back in since my boyfriend left with the apartment complex’s keys) and saw him drive by like 2 minutes after going out. I thought he was going to my apartment as it’s on the same road (me and bf have our own apartments but I stay more at his place than mine). I waited 5 minutes, nothing. My apartment was only a 2 minutes drive from where I was. He finally calls asking if I was home, I said that I was at my boyfriend’s & he said he was on his way. Another 5 minutes goes by, still not there. 10 minutes later he arrived, I’m soaked at this point and irritated. He tells me that he was parked playing Pokémon Go. I’m PoGo player too but damn, that pissed me off.

When we got there, my mom immediately read me and asked me what’s wrong and why I’m all wet. I told her I had to wait on Bryan for like nearly 20 minutes outside because he decided to go play Pokémon Go. She got upset at him and he started yelling saying he never took that long and that I was exaggerating. I called bullshit and he popped off, telling my mom the words that will always ring in the back of my mind: “I told you I never wanted her in my life!”

Ah yeah? Okay. If that's how you feel, go ahead. 

Anyways, I found out on Wednesday that I am pregnant and haven’t told my mother yet. I don’t really want to because when my little sister announced my mother her pregnancy, she begged her to not tell anyone. The second my sister left, she told nearly everyone that stopped by that she was going to be a grandmother again (my other sister has 4 kids).

My SO works in a family business. Everyone in his family like his sisters, brothers, and father. He is the youngest, so he's taken up the mantle that he thinks his other siblings have left (of helping out his dad).

On the weekends, his dad picks up extra work and every weekend he is there right. It doesn't make me mad that he helps his dad as I have tried to explain to him several times, what makes me exasperated to the point that I consider leaving is the fact that it's every weekend. We have two kids together and he doesn't dedicate enough family time.

We always end up arguing when he brings up the fact that I spend time with my family, but I always spend time when he is not around.

Another issue that I've brought up to him is that his mom guilt trips him into going because everyone else is busy. His mom also likes to further up divide him from his siblings by telling him all the nasty things they say about him.

I asked when it was and she said that it was that Saturday so that all her friends could be there. I asked what time it was and she asked me why I wanted to know. I said ""so I know what time to be there lol."" She then said that I wasn't invited since it was mainly going to be her friend group. This hurt but I figured it was her birthday and that she can celebrate however. Regardless I got her a gift and dropped it off at her house. I moved on.

A couple weeks later she just stopped hanging out with me altogether but would still text me. Later in the week my uncle and grandma passed. I sent her a text saying that I wasn't doing great and needed someone to hangout with. She said that she wasn't up to hanging out.

143,1dbjmop,AITA for bringing in a personal visitor to the nursing home I work at to compete at chess with one of the residents?,"I work at an assisted living facility, I.E. a nursing home for people who are very elderly and cannot care for themselves. One of the residents in the wing I work at is ""Josh"", a 97 year old man who has pretty bad cognitive decay. Most of the time, he doesn't remember who I am, who he is, where he is, or what's going on. However, he's a former national chess champion, something I only know about because the personal effects in his room include some of his trophies and other awards. We've got a few sets in the common areas, and if you can wake him up long enough to play, he does still remember how, and he's thrashed most of the staff at one point or another over the board.

Well, it's not a close friend, but I have a guy I know who is kind of a friend of a friend, let's call him ""Bob"", and he's the top player at some local chess association. A LONG way down from a pro player, but the sort of guy who is usually the strongest player in the room. I had mentioned that one of the residents I care for is this former champion, and he asked to come by to visit since Bob's a huge chess nerd and wanted to meet a national champion, no matter what kind of state he was in. We allow visitors, so I signed him in, and by good luck, it was on one of Josh's better days. 

Long story short, they went into one of the common rooms and played chess for 6 hours straight. I wasn't able to stick around to watch most of it, but I talked with Bob afterwards, who said that while he's clearly not the player he was when he won the national championships anymore, Josh is still a 'mean old buzzard' over the board, and won a bit over 2/3 of their games. Josh missed dinner, and I had to get into the canteen after hours and make him some scrambled eggs and toast just so he'd have something to eat. And I was with him for the dinner, and it was the most animated I'd seen him in.... ever, actually. He was actually talking about his day and definitely remembered what was going on, and how this 'young punk' came to challenge him and he had to show the kid how it's done.

All in all, I thought I did a good thing, brightened up a very old, very sick man's day.

144,1dbjjak,WIBTA If I Cut Our Trip To a Central America Short?,"Random throwaway account, also sorry Formatting on mobile sucks.

I (M20) have a trip planned in a few days with a girl (F19) to a Central American country. It was a spur of the moment invitation to ask her. We had dated in the past, and are now trying to get back together-ish. 

However, I am feeling super stressed about it all.

I told her that I would cover everything (and I will), but the trip is currently planned to 14 days...and that is a LOT of money since basically every expense is now doubled (tripled in most cases since she wouldn't take the chicken buses and stuff). And that is just the first issue. I believe that since I invited her, I get the biggest choice in what we do. I like to explore so I planned on booking trips to temples that are multiple days and stuff like that. She is not really in the mood to do stuff like that and it's stressing my ass out having to worry about both spending extra money, and not being able to do what I want.

So, as a middle ground, I would just shorten the trip to 7 days instead of 14. So she gets a trip, I get a trip, and I don't have to worry about losing money and having to spend a bad time with her. It's a 50/50 ball if we will enjoy the time spent, and I think that's one of the biggest stressors I have at the moment. 

I realized I invited her, I realize I told her I'd cover it. Both of those remain the same but I take the initiative to shorten the trip so she still gets what I promised, but I don't know if that would make me the AH.

Throw back to 2020. My husband and I had just gotten engaged, graduated college, and began searching for houses. At the time, we were living with my parents. A little back story, back in college we had just bought a dog and were living in an apartment when we found it had mold. I was sick from it. My parents told me that my dog would die from it if we didn't leave and insisted we move in with them and commute 30 minutes to college. To which I agreed. I am their only child btw. I had a rough upbringing. I thought I was just rebellious but am realizing now they are control freaks. My dad told me when I was 16 that he put a gun to his head outside and almost pulled the trigger and it would have been my fault. My mom called me fat multiple times, forced me into pageants i didn't want to do. she saw my bf kissing me once and wouldn't talk to me for 3 months, couldn't even be in the same room as me or look at me without crying. Oh and she kept saying it's just my first wedding every chance she got. They both told me that being a labor and delivery RN is gay and that I would be a terrible nurse, but I have proved them wrong. There is much more in between all of this but here's some. 

My husband and I were searching for houses, we were going to buy one when we told my parents we'd be moving out. They begged us to stay, said we could transform the garage into a living space and they would move out there. They said they would sign the house over to us. My husband was fond of the idea since he didn't want to live in a neighborhood and my parents have 10 acres. I was not fond of it, but knew we would save money in the long run. So we got a contractor and cashed out my husbands inheritance from his deceased father (he died when my husband was 18). I used all of my savings to help pay. It amounted to about 100k after everything. 

As soon as we paid, my parents demeanor changed. They became rude and insensitive, saying all sorts of horrendous things. They began heavy drinking mid 2020 because my Grandma died and their life was over. 

The drinking got worse, my dad called me a bitch for not wanting to pay $7k for painters. I told them we would paint it ourselves. 


Flash forward to many stupid fights later, we are here and they haven't signed the house over. They claim they are trying to merge the property from my Grandma to their house then they will sign it over. We put an additional 50k into much needed upkeep that they fell short on for 30 years. I'm currently pregnant with our first two children. 

We have had many fights over the dumbest shit. I could go into so many details but we would run out of space. They have made claims that we're taking advantage of them, how they've sacrificed so much and we haven't done anything for them. They blew their top over a paint can saying ""100 dollars isn't much to you but it is to us!"" They have threatened to not add us on the house and have said multiple times this isn't going to work. 

It was my baby shower today. Keep in mind, my mom didn't throw me a bridal shower and claimed she was too busy with the renovation even though my husband and I were handling everything. She didn't offer to throw me a baby shower either. My husbands Grandma and my friend did. 

Last night I texted my Mom saying that we would be leaving at 9. I figured we would be riding together since we live together and she is going to be a Grandma. Well, my mom ignored me and had my father text me. He told me that she won't be riding with me and she will be riding with a cousin. I told him I think that looks poor given she is the Grandma and shouldn't be arriving with other guests. He texted me saying my husband told him that we can't give my mom a ride. I know this is not true. 

What happened was that my husband took the dogs out and at the time had a lot on his mind from work. My dad said my Mom will need a ride to the shower. My Mom insisted she didn't and would drive herself (their car is old and breaking which they have also insinuated that we should be buying them a car). My husband said that either way works and just let us know. 

Continuing, my father told me that he doesn't want to leave anything to us because of this. And I left it at that. 

In the morning, my Mom texted saying she wants to ride with us which we agreed. She never apologized for the behavior or anything, just pretended like nothing was wrong. 

My shower was less than ok. My entire family breezed past me, barely asked about my pregnancy or the babies and talked to my Mom. I sat in the corner with my friend and husbands Grandma while my Mom entertained all of them. She excluded my husbands Grandma from the main dining table and spent an hour talking about how hard her life is with my Dad and his health problems. ""Nobody knows what I go through"" she says. 

The shower basically felt like a show for her. My cousin said ""I heard you and (my Dad) built a tiny house. That must have been expensive."" My mom says ""yeah we did!"" I walked over and said that MY husband and I paid for it. it was asked why my husband and I aren't living in a one bedroom house or if we will build a new one. I told them it wasn't our idea and we spent our entire savings on it so we have no money left to build a house. 

My mom didn't sit by me or take one picture with me prior to this or after. 

After the shower, everyone left and I said to my mom that I wasn't aware everyone was under the impression that they paid for everything. She screamed to of her lungs ""YOU can't KEEP DOING THIS TO ME!"" My husbands Grandpa definately heard. So do you think she's in the right and has scarified more than I have?

The shower basically felt like a show for her. My cousin said ""I heard you and (my Dad) built a tiny house. That must have been expensive."" My mom says ""yeah we did!"" I walked over and said that MY husband and I paid for it. it was asked why my husband and I aren't living in a one bedroom house or if we will build a new one. I told them it wasn't our idea and we spent our entire savings on it so we have no money left to build a house. 

My mom didn't sit by me or take one picture with me prior to this or after. 

After the shower, everyone left and I said to my mom that I wasn't aware everyone was under the impression that they paid for everything. She screamed to of her lungs ""YOU can't KEEP DOING THIS TO ME!"" My husbands Grandpa definately heard. So do you think she's in the right and has scarified more than I have? 

So here we are. Am I the asshole? ",,0.0863929539918899,0,0
146,1dbjfvb,AITA for snapping at my friend for joking about me quitting vaping,"Back in July of last year, my friend recently gotten into vaping and was consistently bringing them around me and our other friends to slowly push us into addiction because she knew we were easily influenced, and decided to take that into her advantage. She was in a less fortunate financial situation than the three of us, and would consistently ask us to buy her 30+ dollar vapes, and eventually she got our one friend to buy her some, this repeated for 2 months. I started doing it alongside her, and so did the others. 

In January of this year I started talking to a new guy and he encouraged me to go cold turkey so I tossed all my vapes and put a lock on my bank account until I knew I could trust myself again. Once my friend knew about my plan, she threw a fit. She started saying I was stupid for that and I shouldn’t be so easily influenced by a man and I tried to reason and say that it was for the better but she was not accepting that. I said that my health was decreasing and I was experiencing a mucus build up in my lungs that wasn’t there prior to that, and she tried to throw in excuses like the mucus is my body asking to vape again and things along those lines, trying to throw addiction propaganda to me. 
I always respected that she still vaped and I just asked her not to bring it around me, but she didn’t listen.

She made friends with another girl who was also as deep in an addiction as her and they started to hang around me and the others and do those things.
Whenever we would go to social events they’d ask if I want a hit and I would say “No thank you! I don’t vape anymore” or something along the lines of that and my friend would say “But when you see a Mango Allo bar you can’t help it! Haha” everytime. She also started sending me vape videos on TikTok, and things along the lines of that to try and tease me about quitting and I just stopped responding. 

My breaking point was this Friday, when we went out for lunch. She mentioned she had bought a new vape and started insisting for me to try. I said my usual automated response “Sorry, I don’t vape anymore.” And she started giving me a judgemental stare “But you would if it was a Mango Allo bar.” so I responded “Nope, I’ve bettered myself.” And she started talking about my addiction, how I spent hundreds on vapes and would sit in my living room and have deep conversations and vape with her, and I snapped. “I’ve changed myself for (my boyfriend) and for my health, I do not need you to continuously remind me that I used to do those things that you still do because it’s NOT MY PROBLEM.” And we sat quietly as she finished eating and I cooled off, and we went our separate ways.

148,1dbje5m,AITA For choosing to go no contact with my uncle?,"I (27M) and My brother (22M) aren't close with our sister (30F) so we decided not to attend said sister's baby shower. Call me the A-Hole for that if you want, that's understandable, but what isn't ok is that our uncle (who I'm not even close enough to to know his age) decided to take great offense to this. Friday, he went to see my dad's place and after getting blackout drunk went to brother's room (brother lives with dad) stormed into his room, and tried to start a fight. Uncle spat on brother, shoved him, and repeatedly asked if brother wanted to hit him. Brother was calm and level headed and knew getting in a fight with a drunk would be more trouble than it's worth and when uncle couldn't get a rise out of him he left in a huff.

 Next day I'm out with my brother (who told me all this had happened while he was in a discord call and had to convince his buddies not to drive over, which one of his friends confirmed this.) And I get a call from a number I don't have saved, so naturally I think it's spam and ignore it... then ignore it again, then I get voicemail, it is uncle, calling to try and meet. I send him a text telling him that my brother has more restraint than i do, and to not contact me again, then immediately block his number 

I'm not worried about said uncle getting physical with me, I'm an army vet and even with a bad back and legs I'd easily mop the floor with a 50 something high school shop teacher, but with my PTSD, I'm worried that I wouldn't stop until he stopped breathing, so I figure the best move is going no contact.

150,1dbhnps,AITA for cancelling my friend's bachelor party 1 day ahead over 15 bucks and because I didn't like one of the friends,"My friend (Adam) is about to get married and his girlfriend (Eva) wanted to organize a surprise party. Eva invited me, Harry and 2 other friends (Brenda and Sam) to a group chat. Me and Harry don't know Brenda or Sam.

The communication was awkward because nobody was really taking the lead and people were just throwing around ideas. Me and Harry were more passive as we knew Adam less well and had confidence the others would have good ideas.

Eventually Brenda had found something that she was pretty confident about. This was pretty expensive though. I said the price being too high and asked to look for cheaper options. Brenda said she found it a reasonable price. I elaborated on why I thought it was too much and also said that we do not know each other's financial situations. Eva and Sam would side with Brenda. Harry would keep quiet.

I asked multiple friends what they thought about the price and most people agreed with me that it was too expensive.

After discussing I eventually gave in.

Later, me and my best friend (Frank) had been talking about going to a music festival. It lasts an entire weekend but we can only go for 1 day. We noticed that Saturday was better because our favorite artists would perform. Unfortunately we could not go on this day because it was on the day of the party. Frank suggested going on Sunday instead because it would still be fun. We agreed to go Sunday.

Months later I notice that I have a couple missed messages. Apparently they went shopping for costumes. They bought a costume for Adam and decided to split the price. Eva sends a text stating ""Because of Adam's costume everyone has to pay another 15 bucks. If there are objections let me know NOW!"" After another 5 minutes Sam puts a pay request in the chat.

I don't find the way this is handled fair. I repeat that I already found the initial price too high and that we don't know each other's financial situations. I end the message saying that I refuse to pay more than I already have.

Eva replies by saying that I am making a big deal out of nothing. Sam does not take it well and writes a really long message about she did not sleep because of my message and that it is unfair to put the financial burden on her instead. She wants nothing to do with us after this.

I apologize and say that I wish this situation could've been different. I say that it is not fun for me either to have to expose my financial situation and that I would have much rather avoided all this drama.

Sam accepts this and we move on. Though I was still angry at Sam.

I could not really picture myself on the party and pretending to have fun while this tension exists.

I decide that I do not want to be on that party anymore and text Frank that Saturday is available. We sold the Sunday tickets and bought the Saturday tickets.

151,1dc607o,AITA for being rude to my stepdaughter and banning her from eating with the family,"I have 2 stepdaughters, Scarlett (18), and Ava (16). 

Scarlett is an amazing singer. She's been in some kind of voice lessons since she was 10 and just graduated from one of the best performing arts schools in the state, where she went on a full scholarship since 6th grade. She has a YouTube channel where she sings that she's starting to make money from and was accepted into some very prestigious music schools. Additionally, she has been working paid gigs for the last 2 years and makes at least $500-1000 per week, more in the summers. She's even been the opening artist at a few concerts. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying she's an objectively good singer. 

Ava, on the other hand, is not a good singer. She likes to believe she is and she might become one if she actually stuck with voice lessons or choir classes but she always quits after 1-2 weeks because they're ""bullying her"" (giving constructive feedback, I've seen the notes her classmates and teachers have given her). 

Ava also likes to sing very loudly and/or at bad times. For example, if she feels that we're too quiet at the dinner table she starts to loudly sing. It doesn't sound good and I honestly don't know how she doesn't hear it. If you ask her to stop she keeps going and if you're blunt and say stop, that doesn't sound good/we don't want to hear it she keeps going and gets even louder just to annoy you. 

If we're in the car and we don't let her choose the songs she'll loudly sing whatever she wants, not what's playing, to annoy us and responds the same way to us telling her to stop. The only person she listens to is her dad. 

A few weeks ago we were trying to eat and she was singing again. I told her to stop and she refused so I took her plate and told her from now on she is no longer allowed to eat at my table. She can eat in her room, the backyard, her car, the garage, wherever she wants as long as we can't hear her from the dining room and that this will continue until she can behave appropriately at the table. 

My husband and I argued about it but he's not home for dinner so there isn't much he can do about it. Today she was eating lunch with us and started singing again. I told her to stop and she didn't listen so I again took her plate and told her to eat somewhere where we can't hear her if she doesn't want to act appropriately. Ava argued that she's a better singer than Scarlett and that Scarlett sings all the time.
