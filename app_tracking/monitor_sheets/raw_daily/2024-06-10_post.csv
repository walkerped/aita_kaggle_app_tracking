0,1dctc9w,WIBTA for doing a paternity test behind my family's back? Update,"Update: Did a 23 and me and got results.

So from my last post many people suggested doing a 23 and me. I found a lot od relatives on my moms side and unfortunately found that my father is in fact not my bio dad. This is information I have kept to myself and I do not wish to share it with anyone else in my family.

I know many of you wanted to know why my fiance was so against it and why he called me an asshole for it. He told me he was only concerned for mt mental health (I was doing very poorly) and he didn't want me to risk my relationship with my siblings. In the end he told me he would support me, but insisted I at least start therapy first. I did and he has been incredibly supportive. We're married now btw!

The man who's my bio dad will never be able to contact me. He was already blocked on any social media I had, but even if he tried I wouldn't respond as I do not trust him.

In the end this has given me a strange peace of mind. I don't sit up at night and worry over it.  My therapist is helping me grapple with the terms of it as well as help me through the disgust I feel with myself over the relationship I had with who I now know was my half sibling. I can't tell him as he passed away a couple years ago in a car accident. 

My relationship with my parents was severed before I ever did the test. I havent spoken to either in over a year now and I am happier than I ever have been. My in laws are great to me and a man I've known for a few years has stepped in and walked me down the aisle. I'm surrounded by people I love, and it's amazing.

I really appreciate everyone's support from my original post. Many of you helped me with good suggestions and no one judged me over the relationship I had had, so I cant thank you all enough. I wish you all safe and happy travels.",UPDATE,2024-06-10,"WIBTA for doing a paternity test behind my family's back? Update Update: Did a 23 and me and got results.

1,1dcom1m,AITA for snapping at my ex about a comment she made?,"My ex and I dated for 3 years in College, She came out as a trans woman about two months after we graduated from college. We broke up a month after she came out because I am straight and she wanted to transition and I didn't see a future.I had wanted to marry them.

Our social circle is pretty entwined. I really didn't mind at the start but now I am starting to have issues which is dumb because we broke about a year and half ago.I can feel my heart breaking every time I hang out with her. All I can see is the life we should have had, We would have been married by now and at then she is happy and thriving while I am a single lonely mess.

I hung out with her and few friends and we were talking about marriage about she teased me about my mom trying to set me up with guys and I kinda lost it and snapped that I wouldn't suffer through that indignity if it wasn't for my only long term relationship ending in such an awful manner. 

She was upset and she ended up leaving just after. My friends are upset with me and they said I should have handled it better because it was not something worth being so mean about. 

I feel guilty because even though the break up sucked, she was very considerate of my feelings and I know that she has some lingering guilt about it and I decided to throw it at her face.",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-06-10,"AITA for snapping at my ex about a comment she made?

2,1dcawfb,AITA for telling my roommate his portion of the security deposit is his problem not ours?,"I, 21 M, live in an apartment with 3 other roommates (all 21 M), and we are all college students. When we first signed the lease, we obviously had to pay a security deposit equal to one month‚Äôs rent and had no issues paying it. Fast forward to a year later when we are considering re-signing the lease for the following year. Our landlord informed us that our rent would be increasing by $400 which is a considerable amount, so one of my roommates said he was considering moving out to a place that is more affordable (which is understandable). When we brought up to our landlord how we may just have 3 of the 4 re-sign the lease, he informed us that we would then have to pay a new security deposit at the new rent price. We would not receive our initial security deposit back by the time we would have to pay the new one because we were still in the middle of the initial lease. When we found this out, a different roommate expressed that this would ‚Äúnot be an option‚Äù because he has to pay for everything himself (the rest of us have our parents help pay) and did not have enough money saved up at the time. The roommate has a relationship with his parents and lives with them when we have breaks from college but claims that his parents would not help him pay the security deposit at all. An important note is he has a historical tendency to lie, particularly about finances. For example, he claimed numerous times that he has to pay for all his tuition and school expenses completely on his own; however, I met his parents one time and in casual conversation they mentioned that they pay part of the bill for school. So, when he first said he did not have the money for the security deposit, I asked wouldn‚Äôt your parents be able to help out and you can just pay them back or whatever. He responded no that‚Äôs simply not how it works they won‚Äôt give me any money. There was some panic discussion between my other roommates while I was in class (so I wasn‚Äôt responding right away) and this roommate specifically said that WE need to figure this out and it is all our problem to solve. Once out of class, I simply responded saying that your part of the deposit is your own responsibility and you need to figure out a way to pay for it on your own, it is not at all a problem for the whole group.

4,1dcashn,AITA for telling my sister that my mom took out the hair extentions that she just put in for her?,"So, every Sunday, me(25F), my sister(20) ,aunt(52), and mom(46) get together to chill at my mom's house.
This week my sister decided to take the time to install ""sew-in"" hair extensions for our mom, since she asked for it, and my sister likes doing hair.

Now, we tend to rag on each other a lot, and me and my aunt were laughing saying the sew-in made it look like she had a receding hairline; And my aunt even joked with me ""call me when she takes it out tonight"".

Now, keep in mind that my sister was here for all of this, and she even laughed while trying to defend her work.
My sister eventually had to leave (she leaves a couple of hrs b4 everyone else).
Some time after she's gone, my aunt notices that my mom is already taking the hair out, and we proceed to laugh again, bcs she called it.

I often notice whenever my sister leaves, and it's just the three of us, I'm the one that gets targeted, and suddenly anything and everything I've said or done is exposed, stuff that I'm uncomfortable being brought up all of sudden.
They don't hound me when my sister is here, usually it's pretty even and unserious.

As for today, when my aunt started helping my mom take the hair out, I was like ""ooh I'm telling [sister]"" (just trying to be funny), my sister isn't the type to get mad about this stuff, so it's not like I was doing it maliciously and thought it would actually make my sister upset with them));
I text her saying our mom was taking it out and that our aunt was an ""accomplice"".
After I did it, I told them about it (I wasn't being sneaky, I just thought it was funny after we just joked about it (WITH MY SISTER HERE); And they immediately started scolding me for it saying ""why would you do something like that!?"", ""that's gonna make her feel bad!"", ""you shouldn't share stuff 
like this to outsiders"" (I swear they were just saying anything, she's family and they do it all the time).
And ofc when I tried to defend myself, while also pointing out how hypocritical they were being considering they do the exact same thing (including just 20mins prior my mom brought up a private matter about me, mocking me for it), but I'm met with either ""that's different"" or ""I don't remember/know what you're talking about"".

And then it ends with them either trying to change the subject (usually my aunt), or to say I'm gaslighting them (usually mom)...
I often feel like since I'm the common denominator between them, it would make sense for me maybe having some fault?? I mean having the same problem with both of them?? It seems unfathomable that they're BOTH gaslighters...
But I also don't know what I do besides defend myself or do things they have done, and tell me isn't a big deal...

7,1dcapnz,AITA for arguing with my dad after i found out he befriended my ex-bf?,"
I (20F) am a college student who lives on campus. I recently came back to my parents‚Äô house for the summer to live with them until the next semester starts. A couple days ago my dad (54M) went out because he said he had some errands to run. I left the house about an hour later to get lunch at a restaurant and I saw my dad at a booth with my ex-boyfriend (20M).

We dated for about a year when we were in high school, and he was very close with my dad because he never had a dad and his mom didn‚Äôt treat him the best. We broke up about a month before I left for college. The reason being because we would have to do long distance. My ex comes from a poorer family than I do and could not afford to go to a four year college. He also felt he was too stupid to go to community college and never applied to one, despite me trying to convince him to. We had differing opinions on going long distance. I wanted to and he didn‚Äôt want to. I never knew why until recently, but he was adamant about this, and I kept trying to convince him to make things work because I thought I was in love with him. One day I guess I pushed the issue too hard because he just started yelling at me. He said some very hurtful things to me, brought up my insecurities, including my mental illness, and finished by saying that he wanted to break up immediately. To this day I consider some of what he said to me to be some of the most hurtful things I‚Äôve ever heard. And it seemed to come completely out of nowhere. I was an emotional wreck for months after.

My dad took me outside when he noticed me in the restaurant and we started arguing. I was kind of emotional, asking him how he could do this, telling him how badly my ex hurt me. He explained that my ex reached out to him after I left for college and said that he still wanted to talk to my dad. My dad said that my ex saw him like a father figure and he thought that my ex needed that kind of influence in his life, and that he was just a kid when he said those things and he never had anybody to teach him how to treat women. We were 18. He also said that my ex told him the reason he said all that hurtful staff was because he thought he wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and didn‚Äôt want to hold me back, but I kept pushing it and he didn‚Äôt know how else to break things off. He never explained this to me, just said he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance, so I don‚Äôt know if I believe that. It ended with me leaving in tears and my dad walking back into the restaurant, saying that he understood why I was upset but that didn‚Äôt mean he had to stop seeing him.

I‚Äôve been staying at a friend‚Äôs house since this all went down. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic, but the thought that my dad has been able to be friendly with someone who hurt me like that makes me sick. My ex never apologized for what he said to me. AITAH?

We broke up about a month before I left for college. The reason being because we would have to do long distance. My ex comes from a poorer family than I do and could not afford to go to a four year college. He also felt he was too stupid to go to community college and never applied to one, despite me trying to convince him to. We had differing opinions on going long distance. I wanted to and he didn‚Äôt want to. I never knew why until recently, but he was adamant about this, and I kept trying to convince him to make things work because I thought I was in love with him. One day I guess I pushed the issue too hard because he just started yelling at me. He said some very hurtful things to me, brought up my insecurities, including my mental illness, and finished by saying that he wanted to break up immediately. To this day I consider some of what he said to me to be some of the most hurtful things I‚Äôve ever heard. And it seemed to come completely out of nowhere. I was an emotional wreck for months after.

My dad took me outside when he noticed me in the restaurant and we started arguing. I was kind of emotional, asking him how he could do this, telling him how badly my ex hurt me. He explained that my ex reached out to him after I left for college and said that he still wanted to talk to my dad. My dad said that my ex saw him like a father figure and he thought that my ex needed that kind of influence in his life, and that he was just a kid when he said those things and he never had anybody to teach him how to treat women. We were 18. He also said that my ex told him the reason he said all that hurtful staff was because he thought he wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and didn‚Äôt want to hold me back, but I kept pushing it and he didn‚Äôt know how else to break things off. He never explained this to me, just said he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance, so I don‚Äôt know if I believe that. It ended with me leaving in tears and my dad walking back into the restaurant, saying that he understood why I was upset but that didn‚Äôt mean he had to stop seeing him.

I‚Äôve been staying at a friend‚Äôs house since this all went down. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic, but the thought that my dad has been able to be friendly with someone who hurt me like that makes me sick. My ex never apologized for what he said to me. AITAH?

8,1dcandu,AITA im refusing to live with my little sister.,"I 19F and my sister 18F will have to move out in under a year as my parents are selling the family home and travelling around the world.

My parents decided on this plan of me and her living together and in doing so would only have to pay the rent for one place instead of two. They have offered to pay for our rent as an apology for selling the house.

I spoke to my parents in private and explained that I wouldn‚Äôt want to live with my sister and gave some pretty good reasons why.

She is incredibly messy and will not clean up after herself unless you bring it up. If you bring it up to often she starts crying and will make a ton of lame excuses as to why she couldn‚Äôt do it.

She has mentioned previously that when she moves out she wants her friends over as often as possible and wants to have a place to pregame before clubs.

She can‚Äôt cook very well so I guarantee I will be cooking for her, or at least having to help her whenever she needs help in the kitchen.

She doesn‚Äôt like to share and so I‚Äôll probably be stuck in my room as she will take over any lounge space we have. She also doesn‚Äôt like compromise and both of our aesthetics are completely different, I know that she would get her way and I would hate what the apartment looks like. I would also get the smaller room as she would demand the bigger one.

My parents told me I was being unfair and wasting a great opportunity of a free place to live. My sister has also found out and is pissed that I‚Äôm throwing away free rent. 

I suggested they pay half of each of our rents and we live in separate places but they won‚Äôt agree to that, so my sister is really mad as I am 100% the reason we are loosing out on this ‚Äúgreat deal‚Äù

14,1dc9z6h,AITA?:I am shunned by my partners family because I told his mother to croak ,"AITA: 
Backstory: I had a rough relationship with my mother in middle/highschool and eventually ended up sleeping in parks, outside or any friends house in the surrounding area for as long as I could. Eventually I met my boyfriend and started going over to his house for the majority of the day and leaving as late as they‚Äôd allow me. Eventually they noticed something wasn‚Äôt right and allowed me to stay until 10pm almost every day. One Xmas eve my mother and I really got into it and she started choking me out to where my Necklace cut my neck. At this point I left not planning to return. I snuck over to my boyfriends and spent the night in the outdoor basement on a metal chair with the spider crickets and stray cats in the middle of winter. Their neighbor had a camera that caught me sneaking in and alerted my boyfriend‚Äôs parents that some ‚Äúhomeless person snuck into their basement.‚Äù at this point they let me stay there, and I slept on the couch, went to every family party for 6 years. His family started to feel like the only family I had. 

I lived here for about four years. A lot of drama. His mother is some form of a narcissist alcoholic with no ability to ration or have a normal conversation. She made my life a living hell and everyone else in that house. She‚Äôd constantly tell him to grow some balls and get rid of me if he seemed upset and she assumed we were arguing. He was punished due to her resentment for me. She‚Äôd tell him to do something simple like the laundry and if he didn‚Äôt do it fast enough somehow it was my fault. She expected us to clean more than anybody else in the household and She expected me to clean up after everyone in the household. And I was still in my boyfriend was still reamed because I never did enough. When I started keeping tabs. I realized I did more than everyone combined. I kept videos and pictures and she was not happy about that. 

 She would scream loudly from downstairs telling him how I ruined him, how I have him by the balls and how much less of a man he is. That we‚Äôre just friends with benefits. If we ever have a kid, it‚Äôll be an asshole. She wouldn‚Äôt let him drive me to see my father who is in hospice because we had to take her car and she said that he couldn‚Äôt use her car for anything related to me and then retracted that statement the next day and said she never said it. 

She would talk crap about you loud enough to where she knows u can hear it but to ur face you are her favorite and she never say anything bad about you.  It only got worse and worse and worse the longer it went on, and I couldn‚Äôt defend myself because if I challenged/ questioned anything, she thought/did/said I was threatened a bed and a roof. Their ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù was used against me in every way shape or form. Not to mention, I was mainly referred to as twat/twatface. Almost always called out of my name. This is was a very dehumanizing experience. I felt like a stray animal stuck. Obviously one will snap eventually, and when I did, I lost it.She was yelling at my
Boyfriend to spontaneously fix something on her car she had never mentioned before because he started helping me do my oil. When he didn‚Äôt stop what he was doing immediately she started throwing out more tasks and yelling we do don‚Äôt do anything around the house. This started a fight between the two of them which somehow like always became about me. She had thrown out that I have ‚Äúdone enough‚Äù to her and now I started defending myself. I asked her what I do? I‚Äôm respectful even when I don‚Äôt deserve to be, I keep my mouth shut and I do what I‚Äôm told even when I‚Äôm being disrespected. She said she has been praying I disappeared since the day I started coming around and I out of a fit of rage told her to croak. I didn‚Äôt mean it, She shoved me around in the bathroom just prior so I was in fight or flight already. Especially being that this is already a traumatic environment for me and having come from a traumatic environment prior I wasn‚Äôt my healthiest most stable self. 

She then preceded to ‚Äúthrow us out‚Äù and we had one day to pack and leave. Now the family I‚Äôve spent the last 6 years with won‚Äôt speak to me and it‚Äôs very awkward. 

Everyone says it‚Äôs best to not even bother with the situation and to forget about it  but this is very much awkward uncomfortable and in a way traumatizing for me and me and my boyfriend have been together now almost 7 years and I‚Äôm very close with his family, I feel almost as if I‚Äôm reliving the abandonment from my own family and not one person believes she will accept any form of apology, nor would it do any one any favors. I have a huge letter written out for her that I was encouraged not to send so I‚Äôll put it here for more context- I know  its a bit rash but I‚Äôm very emotional - please let me know am I the asshole? 

Letter to his mom: 

I‚Äôve had enough of u pretending like you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Boy do I have years worth of shit to say to you. I know this is probably pointless, you have mocked every single time I have tried opening up to you. But all of what I am about to say needed to be said years ago. I am sorry I said a terrible thing, it was out of anger I didn‚Äôt not mean it and I do not wish that upon anyone. it is not my character to pretend I didn‚Äôt say it. But The way you all treated me was disgusting. The way you treat your kids and your family is disgusting. You literally brag about not reaching out to your elderly parents. You complain whenever somebody in your family calls or texts you. But they get mad when nobody texts you or keeps u in the loop.

 Tomina You have drained me. You have been terrible to me for the entire time I‚Äôve known you. maybe not to my face but I‚Äôve heard it all.  
I didn‚Äôt flip out and for no reason it was bound to happen sooner or later. I snapped. A person can only handle so much psychological abuse. I have done nothing to you except date your son and lose my home. I agreed with you even when u were dead wrong, I stayed away every other time you argued with cole, I walked away. I kept my cool even when I had my name thrown in the dirt for no reason other than your own resentment and hatred. And I know you must really hate me because you couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to come to my father‚Äôs funeral. And every time I tried to talk about it to you, you somehow made it about yourself. 

What do u get from being angry all the time?
 You create a very hostile environment. You‚Äôve made it so that I never felt comfortable to open my mouth about anything. 
If anyone in the house said anything that disagreed with you, especially if you are wrong. it‚Äôs a fight. That‚Äôs not healthy. 
 The one time I ever spoke up to you was to deescalate a fight between you and cole because I thought scream fighting about nuts was unnecessary and I was told I had to move out. How nice! You cannot admit u are wrong ever


I‚Äôm sick and tired of every single argument you have with cole actually being about me. You yell at him for literally anything and everything except for the real reason you are mad. Me. You have dreaded my existence since I‚Äôve been around. But we‚Äôre always too scared to say it to my face. You talk a lot of shit like you are bold but you are not tomina. I‚Äôve heard you say some terrible things about me then smile in my face the next day. That‚Äôs not bold that is a coward. You do the same to your kids. You say some terrible things to them and then instead of apologizing as you should, you buy them a bag of chips the next day. Real mature parenting. Teaching your children apologies aren‚Äôt important. Don‚Äôt own up to what you say.
  I‚Äôve literally heard you tell Billy to stop being nicer to me than his own kids all because he offered to pay for my fucking school pictures because no one in my family would. How is that being nicer to me than his kids? That to me sounds a whole lot like jealousy. What are you really mad about? Me! 

 I feel like you and Billy forget why I ended up there. I genuinely feel like you think I wanted to sleep in the basement with the spiders in the middle of winter. You pretend to care about me. you pretend to understand the situation, but I genuinely do not think you knew the extent of what I went through with my mother. You bitched at me for months telling me to be nice to her then I‚Äôd start trying to be nice to her and you use it against me. Mocked me for it. Still do. You may not strangle your kids by the throat like my mother but you do your own damage by calling your child names mid argument like you are the child. You throw tantrums because you don‚Äôt get what u want. Who‚Äôs the adult? Why can‚Äôt you act like one? I can‚Äôt imagine how you spoke to them as children. 

You were never nice to me not even good at faking it. Every day I lost more and more respect for you hearing the way you spoke to and tried to control your children and me included. It‚Äôs honestly about time you got the same treatment. 
You are genuinely not a nice person. i just finally have the balls to say it. 

 You will most likely never have a good relationship with ur kids as adults If u don‚Äôt realize how you treat people will reflect on how u get treated. You‚Äôll haven‚Äôt even even harder time finding someone who‚Äôs gonna kindly take care of you. It would probably of helped out in your marriage too. Maybe then you wouldn‚Äôt be blaming that on ur kids too when ur mood and how u act is all your fault. 

The way you act pushes people away. This will get you nowhere in life with people if you haven‚Äôt already noticed. Especially your kids. You act like you know everything and that your better than everyone when really your a very anxious, sad depressed individual who has no friends no social life no hobbies, skills or talents and a failing marriage all of which you literally blame on ur kids-that is psychological abuse btw. Speaking of psychological abuse‚Ä¶.

It‚Äôs not normal to feel that you cant go to the bathroom in the place that you live. It‚Äôs not normal to feel that you can‚Äôt eat or make food in the place that you live. It‚Äôs not normal to walk on eggshells to avoid shifting your mood one way or the other. This is the environment you create. You are an abusive person. That is the definition of abuse in multiple forms. You may not have ever said u can‚Äôt use the bathroom, but nobody wants to do anything to set you off in any way so if Me going to the bathroom or making food it‚Äôs gonna cause you to huff and puff and throw a fit. I‚Äôll just hold it til everyone‚Äôs asleep. Same thing happened with cleaning. I used to clean all the time when I first moved in. but you started complaining that you couldn‚Äôt find anything. You wouldn‚Äôt say it to me, but I hear you yelling downstairs that you can‚Äôt ever find nothing so I stopped. With the amount of hoarded junk in the house it is impossible to actually get anything clean. You literally told us to just clean around boxes of junk on the floor. You wonder why there‚Äôs mice and ants when ur headboard in ur bedroom is covered in food, food gets left out overnight, and ur bathtub is full of boxes. That‚Äôs disgusting. Good luck with the house checks doing that. 

Did you know there are studies that prove that getting yelled at can literally lead to physical health issues like cardiovascular diseases? You can literally weaken somebody‚Äôs heart and immune system by screaming at them nonstop. If you‚Äôre genuinely worried about your husband‚Äôs health. You should work on yourself there. Maybe he‚Äôd want to be home more. 

FYI It‚Äôs not your child‚Äôs job to talk to you because you don‚Äôt have friends. It‚Äôs not your child‚Äôs job to clean every square inch of the house after you because you didn‚Äôt clean up after yourself before you went to bed the night before. You put that on them like it‚Äôs completely their responsibility. 90% of the messes cole and I clean were everybody elses mess. I can understand wanting to help out, clean up after yourself but you expected us to do literally everything and u expected no one else to clean up after themselves. I kept track for over a month of what Cole did what I did what you did and what Bailey did in a day. I‚Äôll show you that if you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs actually crazy how much we ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do‚Äù Since all but one person in the house works, Why is it that some people are required to do more than others? Why is it that some get to do less but they do enough?

 I‚Äôll tell you why 
Because you resent me so nothing I do is enough. Cole just gets punished by association

Btw Letting a toddler have free roam of the house while you sleep in the middle of the night isn‚Äôt great parenting. Best believe if I ever have a child that is related to you it will never be there alone like that with you. And u continue to act the way u do I promise you it will never be. You‚Äôre the one who said that if me and Cole have a kid he‚Äôs gonna be an asshole. Good thing you won‚Äôt have to meet it. See how there is consequences for what you do and how u treat people!

 I have said this to you before. I speak up when I believe things are wrong and you have kept my mouth shut for about four years too long because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have a say. if I spoke at all, cole had to hear it, I was threatened a place to sleep. I was told to go live with my mom. If living with my mom was as easy and simple as you guys make it out to be. I never would‚Äôve lived there in the first place. I never wanted to live at ur house. Me and Coles relationship struggled for years due to it. I didn‚Äôt enjoy a single moment. I didn‚Äôt feel safe I didn‚Äôt feel welcome and I never felt cared about. I‚Äôve been through more than I could handle in the past seven years, you have put me through more than enough, You have put Cole through more than enough. 


Btw If you want to continue to go around telling ur whole family how much of a bitch I am, I‚Äôll gladly show them my side of the story. Your actions have consequences and you can‚Äôt just go around talking crap about everybody because it makes you feel better. I will clear my name if I have to. I play petty games too.  

I have hundreds of videos of the way you speak nasty to everyone in the house over small things like garbage. I have a video of you telling Cole he can‚Äôt use the car for anything related to me the day before we were going to go see my dying dad then immediately retracted your statement the day after because of how fucked up it is was. You literally tried to keep me from seeing my dying father because you were mad that he was going. 

 I‚Äôve recorded almost every argument you‚Äôve had with cole. Every literal pigsty that I had to clean up that everyone decided to go to bed and leave for the next day. So please try and tell me I‚Äôm wrong I will prove myself to whoever the hell i need to. 

You love telling your side of the story , but you never tell the whole story. Or anywhere near the truth of the situation. You never mention how you act, or what you say that caused the situation to happen how it did. You had no reason to speak to me the way you did to begin with. 

I have been nothing but respectful and grateful to you. I‚Äôve been nothing but patient and given what u have put me through I have been exceptionally forgiving. I am no longer keeping my mouth shut with you. I will say what I need to say. You no longer have that control. I really don‚Äôt care what you think of me. You don‚Äôt think nicely of anyone. You hated every single one of coles friends until now. I have nothing but love for you Billy Bailey and everyone in Cole‚Äôs family but I will not however continue to be abused, taken advantage of, and controlled by people who anrent even related to me. You already drove your kids away. You barely see one grandkid. Why would you wanna make it so that you never see another? I‚Äôm not one to play childish games with grown people, and I do not respect mean girls that shit talk like they are in highschool that are well over 20 years of age. 

 Me and cole are very happy. So you are going to have to grow up let go and accept that. If you don‚Äôt that is u and Cole‚Äôs relationship that suffers. Not ours. If you can‚Äôt be friendly you will 100% get what you give. That‚Äôs life.

 ",TL;DR,2024-06-10,"AITA?:I am shunned by my partners family because I told his mother to croak  AITA: 
Backstory: I had a rough relationship with my mother in middle/highschool and eventually ended up sleeping in parks, outside or any friends house in the surrounding area for as long as I could. Eventually I met my boyfriend and started going over to his house for the majority of the day and leaving as late as they‚Äôd allow me. Eventually they noticed something wasn‚Äôt right and allowed me to stay until 10pm almost every day. One Xmas eve my mother and I really got into it and she started choking me out to where my Necklace cut my neck. At this point I left not planning to return. I snuck over to my boyfriends and spent the night in the outdoor basement on a metal chair with the spider crickets and stray cats in the middle of winter. Their neighbor had a camera that caught me sneaking in and alerted my boyfriend‚Äôs parents that some ‚Äúhomeless person snuck into their basement.‚Äù at this point they let me stay there, and I slept on the couch, went to every family party for 6 years. His family started to feel like the only family I had. 

I lived here for about four years. A lot of drama. His mother is some form of a narcissist alcoholic with no ability to ration or have a normal conversation. She made my life a living hell and everyone else in that house. She‚Äôd constantly tell him to grow some balls and get rid of me if he seemed upset and she assumed we were arguing. He was punished due to her resentment for me. She‚Äôd tell him to do something simple like the laundry and if he didn‚Äôt do it fast enough somehow it was my fault. She expected us to clean more than anybody else in the household and She expected me to clean up after everyone in the household. And I was still in my boyfriend was still reamed because I never did enough. When I started keeping tabs. I realized I did more than everyone combined. I kept videos and pictures and she was not happy about that. 

 She would scream loudly from downstairs telling him how I ruined him, how I have him by the balls and how much less of a man he is. That we‚Äôre just friends with benefits. If we ever have a kid, it‚Äôll be an asshole. She wouldn‚Äôt let him drive me to see my father who is in hospice because we had to take her car and she said that he couldn‚Äôt use her car for anything related to me and then retracted that statement the next day and said she never said it. 

She would talk crap about you loud enough to where she knows u can hear it but to ur face you are her favorite and she never say anything bad about you.  It only got worse and worse and worse the longer it went on, and I couldn‚Äôt defend myself because if I challenged/ questioned anything, she thought/did/said I was threatened a bed and a roof. Their ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù was used against me in every way shape or form. Not to mention, I was mainly referred to as twat/twatface. Almost always called out of my name. This is was a very dehumanizing experience. I felt like a stray animal stuck. Obviously one will snap eventually, and when I did, I lost it.She was yelling at my
Boyfriend to spontaneously fix something on her car she had never mentioned before because he started helping me do my oil. When he didn‚Äôt stop what he was doing immediately she started throwing out more tasks and yelling we do don‚Äôt do anything around the house. This started a fight between the two of them which somehow like always became about me. She had thrown out that I have ‚Äúdone enough‚Äù to her and now I started defending myself. I asked her what I do? I‚Äôm respectful even when I don‚Äôt deserve to be, I keep my mouth shut and I do what I‚Äôm told even when I‚Äôm being disrespected. She said she has been praying I disappeared since the day I started coming around and I out of a fit of rage told her to croak. I didn‚Äôt mean it, She shoved me around in the bathroom just prior so I was in fight or flight already. Especially being that this is already a traumatic environment for me and having come from a traumatic environment prior I wasn‚Äôt my healthiest most stable self. 

She then preceded to ‚Äúthrow us out‚Äù and we had one day to pack and leave. Now the family I‚Äôve spent the last 6 years with won‚Äôt speak to me and it‚Äôs very awkward. 

Everyone says it‚Äôs best to not even bother with the situation and to forget about it  but this is very much awkward uncomfortable and in a way traumatizing for me and me and my boyfriend have been together now almost 7 years and I‚Äôm very close with his family, I feel almost as if I‚Äôm reliving the abandonment from my own family and not one person believes she will accept any form of apology, nor would it do any one any favors. I have a huge letter written out for her that I was encouraged not to send so I‚Äôll put it here for more context- I know  its a bit rash but I‚Äôm very emotional - please let me know am I the asshole? 

Letter to his mom: 

I‚Äôve had enough of u pretending like you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Boy do I have years worth of shit to say to you. I know this is probably pointless, you have mocked every single time I have tried opening up to you. But all of what I am about to say needed to be said years ago. I am sorry I said a terrible thing, it was out of anger I didn‚Äôt not mean it and I do not wish that upon anyone. it is not my character to pretend I didn‚Äôt say it. But The way you all treated me was disgusting. The way you treat your kids and your family is disgusting. You literally brag about not reaching out to your elderly parents. You complain whenever somebody in your family calls or texts you. But they get mad when nobody texts you or keeps u in the loop.

 Tomina You have drained me. You have been terrible to me for the entire time I‚Äôve known you. maybe not to my face but I‚Äôve heard it all.  
I didn‚Äôt flip out and for no reason it was bound to happen sooner or later. I snapped. A person can only handle so much psychological abuse. I have done nothing to you except date your son and lose my home. I agreed with you even when u were dead wrong, I stayed away every other time you argued with cole, I walked away. I kept my cool even when I had my name thrown in the dirt for no reason other than your own resentment and hatred. And I know you must really hate me because you couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to come to my father‚Äôs funeral. And every time I tried to talk about it to you, you somehow made it about yourself. 

What do u get from being angry all the time?
 You create a very hostile environment. You‚Äôve made it so that I never felt comfortable to open my mouth about anything. 
If anyone in the house said anything that disagreed with you, especially if you are wrong. it‚Äôs a fight. That‚Äôs not healthy. 
 The one time I ever spoke up to you was to deescalate a fight between you and cole because I thought scream fighting about nuts was unnecessary and I was told I had to move out. How nice! You cannot admit u are wrong ever


I‚Äôm sick and tired of every single argument you have with cole actually being about me. You yell at him for literally anything and everything except for the real reason you are mad. Me. You have dreaded my existence since I‚Äôve been around. But we‚Äôre always too scared to say it to my face. You talk a lot of shit like you are bold but you are not tomina. I‚Äôve heard you say some terrible things about me then smile in my face the next day. That‚Äôs not bold that is a coward. You do the same to your kids. You say some terrible things to them and then instead of apologizing as you should, you buy them a bag of chips the next day. Real mature parenting. Teaching your children apologies aren‚Äôt important. Don‚Äôt own up to what you say.

16,1dc9muc,AITA for asking my GF of 4 years if we could go to her friends wedding solo ,"Hey everyone , first post here and this just happened and I really need some clarification as I myself feel a little conflicted given my GF‚Äôs response . About 8 months ago we were told by my GF‚Äôs friend from college that she was getting engaged and would love to have us at her wedding this upcoming August . I was excited as it is in Chicago and living in New England it‚Äôs a nice switch and I don‚Äôt get out past the surrounding states much . We have been talking about this for months and planning to stay a few days before and after the wedding to explore the city and have a nice romantic time as well as a blast at the wedding . Tonight comes up and my GF is having a planned call with the bride to talk about things and iron out plans on where we should get a hotel that is close to the venue , as well as just a chit chat about the wedding in general. I stepped out with her family for a boat ride ( we‚Äôre at her parents house for the weekend ) so she had privacy for her call. We all come back in and I ask her how the call went and she‚Äôs telling me how well it went . Then she tells me that the her friend told her in passing that her mom could come as well ( I thought just as a nice gesture ) . She then proceeds to ask her mom if she wants to come. Her mom initially says idk , then they start actually talking about it seriously and her mom is now seeing if she can get time off of work to go with us . After that , we were alone for a minute and mentioned I thought it would‚Äôve been nice for her to ask me if I thought it was cool if her mom tagged along first , seeing as we‚Äôve been planning this for a while and planning not just to attend the wedding but stay some extra time for a romantic getaway as well. She responded harshly and said if I want to ask my mom to come I will , and more or less chastised me for even questioning her and that it was mean for me to not want her to come if she could . I love her family , but we don‚Äôt get out for things together like this often due to school and money constraints , so I felt kind of disrespected and left out by this .

Long story short, he ended up telling me it would be better off if I did it myself because I don't have any purpose on this planet when I can't even stay in school. I started therapy soon after, but my ex would randomly snap my bsfs or try and hang out with them knowing it would get under my skin months after we ended. My ex then got a new girlfriend and at this point I was pretty moved on from him but seeing him with someone else threw me for a loop.

Quite often those people go first to one shop, then to the second, we know and cooperate with workers from the other shop as well, so everybody knows everyone etc.
It came to my attention that one of the employees from the other shop gives away vouchers for free stuff to one of our regular, which I thought I had a good relationship with. I made sure that both of them are aware that this is basically a fraud that's being taken very seriously by the company and it may get the employee in trouble. But I was pretty chilled about it, like it doesn't cost the company much and after all it's none of my business, so I only advised them to use these vouchers in the other shop, to not raise anyone else's suspicions or something.

Apparently not, cause few days ago I saw them in my shop using the voucher. I accepted the voucher but told them in a friendly, calm, like a worried friend to another friend way to not use them here.

I refused, and they got really mad. Both my siblings are picky eaters and wouldn‚Äôt eat healthy food anyways, and it‚Äôs not like our parents feed us healthy food for dinner either. Our parents make us very similar food to the stuff I make, or they bring home fast food.

It‚Äôs a lot of extra work to cook healthier meals that my picky siblings would eat and I really just don‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle. AITA?

Extra info: I‚Äôm not being paid for babysitting them all day, nor do our parents bring home healthy meals for dinner ",0.0,0.018571522,0,1
25,1dc8rgb,AITA for confronting my friend after she cut me from her wedding,"First time posting, sorry for any grammar and spelling errors. Advice is always appreciated. Hello to Vincey and The Click if you read this.

A bit of backstory

I (23 F) have this friend, Ann (23 F) that I've known since freshman year of high school. After graduating, we lost contact for a year due to moving cities before reconnecting again at a job. We agreed to move in together and few months later, her boyfriend (now fianc√©) moved in as well because his needed a place. Since both our names were on the lease, they needed my approval for the landlord to allow it, and even though I hadn't met him, I agreed. I even helped him find a new job.

Fast-forward a year later and the boyfriend got a promotion in a different city, the original plan was for me to move with them because, again, rent is high and I had nowhere else to go. Well, right as we were applying for rental houses, Ann changed the agreement at last minute stating that they would only let me stay with them for a year before I'd have to move out after I asked how the lease was going to go. I wasn't planning on living  
with them forever, but with the short time frame I wouldn't be able to save up enough to get my own place in a city I've never been to with an even higher cost of living. He was not aware of this change until I texted them in our group chat about declining to move because of the short time span. I was upset at the sudden change of plans, only because this was three months before our lease was up, but I found a different apartment with the help of a friend's family who would lease me one of their properties to me to keep me off the streets.

This whole time, they were planning their wedding and asked if I would be a bridesmaid. Of course, I agreed. I had known Ann for almost eight years and was becoming decent friends with the future groom. After I moved, Ann made a Facebook post about the wedding date being changed to this November instead of next year. Feeling confused, I messaged her about it so I could go buy a bridesmaid dress. Ann just says she isn't doing a bridal party anymore, but I would still be invited. Two weeks ago, Ann posted, once again, on Facebook and announced that invites were sent out and that we'd get them by the end of that week. That only fifty people could be invited and there was no reason for someone not to be invited besides not having the space.

I still haven't gotten the invite she had said I would get. I understand that it's her wedding, but both her and her now fianc√© expressed that they wanted me there, they wanted me to be A PART of the wedding, but now I'm not even invited to attend. I just feel used. I did so much for them, only for her to change plans that affected my living situation and not invite me to her wedding after previously being a bridesmaid. I sent a message expressing how I felt hurt and why I did, but she never responded and our mutuals started scolding me for it.

26,1dc8qm9,AITAH for asking my best friend to step down as my MOH,"Me, A, and B (all f26) have been best friends since childhood, and we've stayed close despite B moving out of state for college and graduate school. A little over a year ago B moved to our city, and my fiance proposed last June. A&B are both like sisters to me, but I knew B was struggling socially since her move, and thought this would be a good opportunity for her to get to know our friend group-- A agreed. At first B was super engaged and involved; but when A proposed they throw me a surprise bridal shower she completely dropped the ball and left A hanging, I didn't learn this until much later but luckily had planned my own mini shower/brunch at my aunt's atelier, where the girls could also try on a few different styles/colors so we could pick their dresses! At first it was a fun day, but B's mood completely soured while we were trying on dresses; her critiques were so disrespectful and rude we ended the day early without picking a dress. I called her that night and she apologized profusely-- B runs her own business and explained that she took a financial hit recently and took the stress out on us. She also apologized to the rest of the party. A decided to step in and help plan the bachelorette weekend to help B out, but there was an emergency with my dress and B insisted A help and let her handle the trip to make up for the dress fiasco. I wanted a relaxing spa weekend away with my girls, which I am lucky to be able to afford and offered to supplement for anyone who wasn't comfy paying that much for a bachelorette party. I had already picked the hotel, B just had to handle booking and coordinating flights with the girls. I got so wrapped up in planning I just trust B to handle it. A month before the weekend, A comes to me in tears. She had noticed that B wasn't replying to questions about the party so she reached out privately. B called her hysterical and reavealed that work got so overwhelming she completely forgot to book until it was too late and that weekend was full, so she booked a completely different party (gambling, clubbing, etc) but was too afraid to tell me?? This is also when A tells me about the surprise party that never was. I'm obviously pissed, but like i said B is like a sister so I'm mostly concerned. I'm thinking this clearly isn't good for her mental health so I take her to coffee and basically explain that i understand she's overwhelmed and I want to take MOH off her plate so she can just enjoy the wedding and hopefully be less stressed with work. She first asks for another chance to which I remind her she's already had two. She then freaks out, accuses me of setting her up to fail so A could be my MOH instead, and storms out. My friends think I'm justified but I'm worried I'm going to lose this friendship; I care about B and truly just want the best for her here... but maybe i could've explained it better? There's a LOT more context here but i had to cut it out to stay under the word limit-- hopefully I can elaborate in comments!

Almost a year ago, my sister lost rights to her daughter and was incarcerated(heavy drug user.) I took in my niece(13) who came with a 2 year old dog. This dog wasn‚Äôt trained in the least bit, and my niece only takes her out when she feels like it. It uses the bathroom all over the house, which I am constantly cleaning bc I have a 5 week old baby and it is so exhausting. She barks constantly if there‚Äôs any unusual noise, voice or knocking, wakes us up or the baby. I had given my niece a chore list to do after school with the dog, but since summers started she hasn‚Äôt been completing it.

I have talked to my niece about this many of times and the importance of cleanness, there‚Äôs an infant in the house, we don‚Äôt want stinky and dirty and germs, that the state can have an unexpected visit anytime n this will make us look bad, that if we couldn‚Äôt do this then we‚Äôd have to rehome her.

28,1dc8bjm,AITA for telling my mom to kick out my father?,"I 17M have recently told my mother 36 that she needs to kick out my father 38. My mother and father got a divorce 2 years ago. They got divorced because I caught my father cheating. My family and I live in a fairly wealthy neighborhood, both of my parents work high paying jobs and had amazing reputations. However during my mother's pregnancy with my little brother my father started cheating. He didn't have one affair partner, he was sleeping with every women in town. I caught him cheating 2 years ago when I was across the street my my girlfriend's house. My dad walked out of her parents bedroom with just his underwear on followed by her mom in his shirt. We both started freaking out and I called my mom to come over. My mom saw them through a window on the porch and took pictures and ended up serving him with divorce papers within the next 6 months. My girlfriends parents had a quicker divorce and her father ended up moving in with his parents who lived a town over. My mom let my dad live in the house for 2 years after their divorce! He moved into the guest bedroom and she stayed in her room. Around a year ago my girlfriend and I broke up and my mom started seeing her father. Her father who is 36 is going to be proposing to my mom next month. He moved in at the end of the last year and my mom is due to have have his child very soon. My father just gets in fights with my little brother and I and is basically estranged from us. He has always been a clean cut well kept man that I aspired to be like and now he has let his hair grow out he showers maybe once a week and has stains all over everything in his room he even got fired from his job. I graduated early and have just been accepted into my dream college that is a few states away from where I currently reside. I don't want my father around to ruin my families lives anymore especially when I won't be around to shelter my little brother from it. My mom's fianc√© has complained about him being here because he doesn't pay any bills and just raids the fridge. My last straw with my father was when I cam home from work and saw all of the plates smashed in the kitchen and my mother's bedroom door ripped off the hinges. I had a screaming match with my dad and told him to leave but he continued to argue saying I have no authority over him and it is technically his house still. I've been saving money from my job and I am planning to give it to my mother to buy him out so he can officially be out of our life and when I turn 18 I plan to take my mother's maiden name or her fianc√©'s last name. My mother was hesitant but I ended up helping her buy him out and file for a restraining order. He was served with an eviction notice and I reached out to one of his affair partners who recently had his child and he is going to move in with her. My soon to be step-father and my mother are proud of me for wanting to protect my family but my father is still raging at me for getting him kicked out. AITA?

small edit: my mother had to take a major demotion due to her mental state during the divorce and we ended up falling on hard times.
