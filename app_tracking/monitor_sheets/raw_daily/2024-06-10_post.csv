0,1dctc9w,WIBTA for doing a paternity test behind my family's back? Update,"Update: Did a 23 and me and got results.

So from my last post many people suggested doing a 23 and me. I found a lot od relatives on my moms side and unfortunately found that my father is in fact not my bio dad. This is information I have kept to myself and I do not wish to share it with anyone else in my family.

I know many of you wanted to know why my fiance was so against it and why he called me an asshole for it. He told me he was only concerned for mt mental health (I was doing very poorly) and he didn't want me to risk my relationship with my siblings. In the end he told me he would support me, but insisted I at least start therapy first. I did and he has been incredibly supportive. We're married now btw!

The man who's my bio dad will never be able to contact me. He was already blocked on any social media I had, but even if he tried I wouldn't respond as I do not trust him.

In the end this has given me a strange peace of mind. I don't sit up at night and worry over it.  My therapist is helping me grapple with the terms of it as well as help me through the disgust I feel with myself over the relationship I had with who I now know was my half sibling. I can't tell him as he passed away a couple years ago in a car accident. 

My relationship with my parents was severed before I ever did the test. I havent spoken to either in over a year now and I am happier than I ever have been. My in laws are great to me and a man I've known for a few years has stepped in and walked me down the aisle. I'm surrounded by people I love, and it's amazing.

I really appreciate everyone's support from my original post. Many of you helped me with good suggestions and no one judged me over the relationship I had had, so I cant thank you all enough. I wish you all safe and happy travels.",UPDATE,2024-06-10,"WIBTA for doing a paternity test behind my family's back? Update Update: Did a 23 and me and got results.

1,1dcom1m,AITA for snapping at my ex about a comment she made?,"My ex and I dated for 3 years in College, She came out as a trans woman about two months after we graduated from college. We broke up a month after she came out because I am straight and she wanted to transition and I didn't see a future.I had wanted to marry them.

Our social circle is pretty entwined. I really didn't mind at the start but now I am starting to have issues which is dumb because we broke about a year and half ago.I can feel my heart breaking every time I hang out with her. All I can see is the life we should have had, We would have been married by now and at then she is happy and thriving while I am a single lonely mess.

I hung out with her and few friends and we were talking about marriage about she teased me about my mom trying to set me up with guys and I kinda lost it and snapped that I wouldn't suffer through that indignity if it wasn't for my only long term relationship ending in such an awful manner. 

She was upset and she ended up leaving just after. My friends are upset with me and they said I should have handled it better because it was not something worth being so mean about. 

I feel guilty because even though the break up sucked, she was very considerate of my feelings and I know that she has some lingering guilt about it and I decided to throw it at her face.",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-06-10,"AITA for snapping at my ex about a comment she made?

2,1dcawfb,AITA for telling my roommate his portion of the security deposit is his problem not ours?,"I, 21 M, live in an apartment with 3 other roommates (all 21 M), and we are all college students. When we first signed the lease, we obviously had to pay a security deposit equal to one month‚Äôs rent and had no issues paying it. Fast forward to a year later when we are considering re-signing the lease for the following year. Our landlord informed us that our rent would be increasing by $400 which is a considerable amount, so one of my roommates said he was considering moving out to a place that is more affordable (which is understandable). When we brought up to our landlord how we may just have 3 of the 4 re-sign the lease, he informed us that we would then have to pay a new security deposit at the new rent price. We would not receive our initial security deposit back by the time we would have to pay the new one because we were still in the middle of the initial lease. When we found this out, a different roommate expressed that this would ‚Äúnot be an option‚Äù because he has to pay for everything himself (the rest of us have our parents help pay) and did not have enough money saved up at the time. The roommate has a relationship with his parents and lives with them when we have breaks from college but claims that his parents would not help him pay the security deposit at all. An important note is he has a historical tendency to lie, particularly about finances. For example, he claimed numerous times that he has to pay for all his tuition and school expenses completely on his own; however, I met his parents one time and in casual conversation they mentioned that they pay part of the bill for school. So, when he first said he did not have the money for the security deposit, I asked wouldn‚Äôt your parents be able to help out and you can just pay them back or whatever. He responded no that‚Äôs simply not how it works they won‚Äôt give me any money. There was some panic discussion between my other roommates while I was in class (so I wasn‚Äôt responding right away) and this roommate specifically said that WE need to figure this out and it is all our problem to solve. Once out of class, I simply responded saying that your part of the deposit is your own responsibility and you need to figure out a way to pay for it on your own, it is not at all a problem for the whole group.

4,1dcashn,AITA for telling my sister that my mom took out the hair extentions that she just put in for her?,"So, every Sunday, me(25F), my sister(20) ,aunt(52), and mom(46) get together to chill at my mom's house.
This week my sister decided to take the time to install ""sew-in"" hair extensions for our mom, since she asked for it, and my sister likes doing hair.

Now, we tend to rag on each other a lot, and me and my aunt were laughing saying the sew-in made it look like she had a receding hairline; And my aunt even joked with me ""call me when she takes it out tonight"".

Now, keep in mind that my sister was here for all of this, and she even laughed while trying to defend her work.
My sister eventually had to leave (she leaves a couple of hrs b4 everyone else).
Some time after she's gone, my aunt notices that my mom is already taking the hair out, and we proceed to laugh again, bcs she called it.

I often notice whenever my sister leaves, and it's just the three of us, I'm the one that gets targeted, and suddenly anything and everything I've said or done is exposed, stuff that I'm uncomfortable being brought up all of sudden.
They don't hound me when my sister is here, usually it's pretty even and unserious.

As for today, when my aunt started helping my mom take the hair out, I was like ""ooh I'm telling [sister]"" (just trying to be funny), my sister isn't the type to get mad about this stuff, so it's not like I was doing it maliciously and thought it would actually make my sister upset with them));
I text her saying our mom was taking it out and that our aunt was an ""accomplice"".
After I did it, I told them about it (I wasn't being sneaky, I just thought it was funny after we just joked about it (WITH MY SISTER HERE); And they immediately started scolding me for it saying ""why would you do something like that!?"", ""that's gonna make her feel bad!"", ""you shouldn't share stuff 
like this to outsiders"" (I swear they were just saying anything, she's family and they do it all the time).
And ofc when I tried to defend myself, while also pointing out how hypocritical they were being considering they do the exact same thing (including just 20mins prior my mom brought up a private matter about me, mocking me for it), but I'm met with either ""that's different"" or ""I don't remember/know what you're talking about"".

And then it ends with them either trying to change the subject (usually my aunt), or to say I'm gaslighting them (usually mom)...
I often feel like since I'm the common denominator between them, it would make sense for me maybe having some fault?? I mean having the same problem with both of them?? It seems unfathomable that they're BOTH gaslighters...
But I also don't know what I do besides defend myself or do things they have done, and tell me isn't a big deal...

7,1dcapnz,AITA for arguing with my dad after i found out he befriended my ex-bf?,"
I (20F) am a college student who lives on campus. I recently came back to my parents‚Äô house for the summer to live with them until the next semester starts. A couple days ago my dad (54M) went out because he said he had some errands to run. I left the house about an hour later to get lunch at a restaurant and I saw my dad at a booth with my ex-boyfriend (20M).

We dated for about a year when we were in high school, and he was very close with my dad because he never had a dad and his mom didn‚Äôt treat him the best. We broke up about a month before I left for college. The reason being because we would have to do long distance. My ex comes from a poorer family than I do and could not afford to go to a four year college. He also felt he was too stupid to go to community college and never applied to one, despite me trying to convince him to. We had differing opinions on going long distance. I wanted to and he didn‚Äôt want to. I never knew why until recently, but he was adamant about this, and I kept trying to convince him to make things work because I thought I was in love with him. One day I guess I pushed the issue too hard because he just started yelling at me. He said some very hurtful things to me, brought up my insecurities, including my mental illness, and finished by saying that he wanted to break up immediately. To this day I consider some of what he said to me to be some of the most hurtful things I‚Äôve ever heard. And it seemed to come completely out of nowhere. I was an emotional wreck for months after.

My dad took me outside when he noticed me in the restaurant and we started arguing. I was kind of emotional, asking him how he could do this, telling him how badly my ex hurt me. He explained that my ex reached out to him after I left for college and said that he still wanted to talk to my dad. My dad said that my ex saw him like a father figure and he thought that my ex needed that kind of influence in his life, and that he was just a kid when he said those things and he never had anybody to teach him how to treat women. We were 18. He also said that my ex told him the reason he said all that hurtful staff was because he thought he wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and didn‚Äôt want to hold me back, but I kept pushing it and he didn‚Äôt know how else to break things off. He never explained this to me, just said he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance, so I don‚Äôt know if I believe that. It ended with me leaving in tears and my dad walking back into the restaurant, saying that he understood why I was upset but that didn‚Äôt mean he had to stop seeing him.

I‚Äôve been staying at a friend‚Äôs house since this all went down. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic, but the thought that my dad has been able to be friendly with someone who hurt me like that makes me sick. My ex never apologized for what he said to me. AITAH?

We broke up about a month before I left for college. The reason being because we would have to do long distance. My ex comes from a poorer family than I do and could not afford to go to a four year college. He also felt he was too stupid to go to community college and never applied to one, despite me trying to convince him to. We had differing opinions on going long distance. I wanted to and he didn‚Äôt want to. I never knew why until recently, but he was adamant about this, and I kept trying to convince him to make things work because I thought I was in love with him. One day I guess I pushed the issue too hard because he just started yelling at me. He said some very hurtful things to me, brought up my insecurities, including my mental illness, and finished by saying that he wanted to break up immediately. To this day I consider some of what he said to me to be some of the most hurtful things I‚Äôve ever heard. And it seemed to come completely out of nowhere. I was an emotional wreck for months after.

My dad took me outside when he noticed me in the restaurant and we started arguing. I was kind of emotional, asking him how he could do this, telling him how badly my ex hurt me. He explained that my ex reached out to him after I left for college and said that he still wanted to talk to my dad. My dad said that my ex saw him like a father figure and he thought that my ex needed that kind of influence in his life, and that he was just a kid when he said those things and he never had anybody to teach him how to treat women. We were 18. He also said that my ex told him the reason he said all that hurtful staff was because he thought he wasn‚Äôt good enough for me and didn‚Äôt want to hold me back, but I kept pushing it and he didn‚Äôt know how else to break things off. He never explained this to me, just said he didn‚Äôt want to do long distance, so I don‚Äôt know if I believe that. It ended with me leaving in tears and my dad walking back into the restaurant, saying that he understood why I was upset but that didn‚Äôt mean he had to stop seeing him.

I‚Äôve been staying at a friend‚Äôs house since this all went down. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being dramatic, but the thought that my dad has been able to be friendly with someone who hurt me like that makes me sick. My ex never apologized for what he said to me. AITAH?

8,1dcandu,AITA im refusing to live with my little sister.,"I 19F and my sister 18F will have to move out in under a year as my parents are selling the family home and travelling around the world.

My parents decided on this plan of me and her living together and in doing so would only have to pay the rent for one place instead of two. They have offered to pay for our rent as an apology for selling the house.

I spoke to my parents in private and explained that I wouldn‚Äôt want to live with my sister and gave some pretty good reasons why.

She is incredibly messy and will not clean up after herself unless you bring it up. If you bring it up to often she starts crying and will make a ton of lame excuses as to why she couldn‚Äôt do it.

She has mentioned previously that when she moves out she wants her friends over as often as possible and wants to have a place to pregame before clubs.

She can‚Äôt cook very well so I guarantee I will be cooking for her, or at least having to help her whenever she needs help in the kitchen.

She doesn‚Äôt like to share and so I‚Äôll probably be stuck in my room as she will take over any lounge space we have. She also doesn‚Äôt like compromise and both of our aesthetics are completely different, I know that she would get her way and I would hate what the apartment looks like. I would also get the smaller room as she would demand the bigger one.

My parents told me I was being unfair and wasting a great opportunity of a free place to live. My sister has also found out and is pissed that I‚Äôm throwing away free rent. 

I suggested they pay half of each of our rents and we live in separate places but they won‚Äôt agree to that, so my sister is really mad as I am 100% the reason we are loosing out on this ‚Äúgreat deal‚Äù

14,1dc9z6h,AITA?:I am shunned by my partners family because I told his mother to croak ,"AITA: 
Backstory: I had a rough relationship with my mother in middle/highschool and eventually ended up sleeping in parks, outside or any friends house in the surrounding area for as long as I could. Eventually I met my boyfriend and started going over to his house for the majority of the day and leaving as late as they‚Äôd allow me. Eventually they noticed something wasn‚Äôt right and allowed me to stay until 10pm almost every day. One Xmas eve my mother and I really got into it and she started choking me out to where my Necklace cut my neck. At this point I left not planning to return. I snuck over to my boyfriends and spent the night in the outdoor basement on a metal chair with the spider crickets and stray cats in the middle of winter. Their neighbor had a camera that caught me sneaking in and alerted my boyfriend‚Äôs parents that some ‚Äúhomeless person snuck into their basement.‚Äù at this point they let me stay there, and I slept on the couch, went to every family party for 6 years. His family started to feel like the only family I had. 

I lived here for about four years. A lot of drama. His mother is some form of a narcissist alcoholic with no ability to ration or have a normal conversation. She made my life a living hell and everyone else in that house. She‚Äôd constantly tell him to grow some balls and get rid of me if he seemed upset and she assumed we were arguing. He was punished due to her resentment for me. She‚Äôd tell him to do something simple like the laundry and if he didn‚Äôt do it fast enough somehow it was my fault. She expected us to clean more than anybody else in the household and She expected me to clean up after everyone in the household. And I was still in my boyfriend was still reamed because I never did enough. When I started keeping tabs. I realized I did more than everyone combined. I kept videos and pictures and she was not happy about that. 

 She would scream loudly from downstairs telling him how I ruined him, how I have him by the balls and how much less of a man he is. That we‚Äôre just friends with benefits. If we ever have a kid, it‚Äôll be an asshole. She wouldn‚Äôt let him drive me to see my father who is in hospice because we had to take her car and she said that he couldn‚Äôt use her car for anything related to me and then retracted that statement the next day and said she never said it. 

She would talk crap about you loud enough to where she knows u can hear it but to ur face you are her favorite and she never say anything bad about you.  It only got worse and worse and worse the longer it went on, and I couldn‚Äôt defend myself because if I challenged/ questioned anything, she thought/did/said I was threatened a bed and a roof. Their ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù was used against me in every way shape or form. Not to mention, I was mainly referred to as twat/twatface. Almost always called out of my name. This is was a very dehumanizing experience. I felt like a stray animal stuck. Obviously one will snap eventually, and when I did, I lost it.She was yelling at my
Boyfriend to spontaneously fix something on her car she had never mentioned before because he started helping me do my oil. When he didn‚Äôt stop what he was doing immediately she started throwing out more tasks and yelling we do don‚Äôt do anything around the house. This started a fight between the two of them which somehow like always became about me. She had thrown out that I have ‚Äúdone enough‚Äù to her and now I started defending myself. I asked her what I do? I‚Äôm respectful even when I don‚Äôt deserve to be, I keep my mouth shut and I do what I‚Äôm told even when I‚Äôm being disrespected. She said she has been praying I disappeared since the day I started coming around and I out of a fit of rage told her to croak. I didn‚Äôt mean it, She shoved me around in the bathroom just prior so I was in fight or flight already. Especially being that this is already a traumatic environment for me and having come from a traumatic environment prior I wasn‚Äôt my healthiest most stable self. 

She then preceded to ‚Äúthrow us out‚Äù and we had one day to pack and leave. Now the family I‚Äôve spent the last 6 years with won‚Äôt speak to me and it‚Äôs very awkward. 

Everyone says it‚Äôs best to not even bother with the situation and to forget about it  but this is very much awkward uncomfortable and in a way traumatizing for me and me and my boyfriend have been together now almost 7 years and I‚Äôm very close with his family, I feel almost as if I‚Äôm reliving the abandonment from my own family and not one person believes she will accept any form of apology, nor would it do any one any favors. I have a huge letter written out for her that I was encouraged not to send so I‚Äôll put it here for more context- I know  its a bit rash but I‚Äôm very emotional - please let me know am I the asshole? 

Letter to his mom: 

I‚Äôve had enough of u pretending like you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Boy do I have years worth of shit to say to you. I know this is probably pointless, you have mocked every single time I have tried opening up to you. But all of what I am about to say needed to be said years ago. I am sorry I said a terrible thing, it was out of anger I didn‚Äôt not mean it and I do not wish that upon anyone. it is not my character to pretend I didn‚Äôt say it. But The way you all treated me was disgusting. The way you treat your kids and your family is disgusting. You literally brag about not reaching out to your elderly parents. You complain whenever somebody in your family calls or texts you. But they get mad when nobody texts you or keeps u in the loop.

 Tomina You have drained me. You have been terrible to me for the entire time I‚Äôve known you. maybe not to my face but I‚Äôve heard it all.  
I didn‚Äôt flip out and for no reason it was bound to happen sooner or later. I snapped. A person can only handle so much psychological abuse. I have done nothing to you except date your son and lose my home. I agreed with you even when u were dead wrong, I stayed away every other time you argued with cole, I walked away. I kept my cool even when I had my name thrown in the dirt for no reason other than your own resentment and hatred. And I know you must really hate me because you couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to come to my father‚Äôs funeral. And every time I tried to talk about it to you, you somehow made it about yourself. 

What do u get from being angry all the time?
 You create a very hostile environment. You‚Äôve made it so that I never felt comfortable to open my mouth about anything. 
If anyone in the house said anything that disagreed with you, especially if you are wrong. it‚Äôs a fight. That‚Äôs not healthy. 
 The one time I ever spoke up to you was to deescalate a fight between you and cole because I thought scream fighting about nuts was unnecessary and I was told I had to move out. How nice! You cannot admit u are wrong ever


I‚Äôm sick and tired of every single argument you have with cole actually being about me. You yell at him for literally anything and everything except for the real reason you are mad. Me. You have dreaded my existence since I‚Äôve been around. But we‚Äôre always too scared to say it to my face. You talk a lot of shit like you are bold but you are not tomina. I‚Äôve heard you say some terrible things about me then smile in my face the next day. That‚Äôs not bold that is a coward. You do the same to your kids. You say some terrible things to them and then instead of apologizing as you should, you buy them a bag of chips the next day. Real mature parenting. Teaching your children apologies aren‚Äôt important. Don‚Äôt own up to what you say.
  I‚Äôve literally heard you tell Billy to stop being nicer to me than his own kids all because he offered to pay for my fucking school pictures because no one in my family would. How is that being nicer to me than his kids? That to me sounds a whole lot like jealousy. What are you really mad about? Me! 

 I feel like you and Billy forget why I ended up there. I genuinely feel like you think I wanted to sleep in the basement with the spiders in the middle of winter. You pretend to care about me. you pretend to understand the situation, but I genuinely do not think you knew the extent of what I went through with my mother. You bitched at me for months telling me to be nice to her then I‚Äôd start trying to be nice to her and you use it against me. Mocked me for it. Still do. You may not strangle your kids by the throat like my mother but you do your own damage by calling your child names mid argument like you are the child. You throw tantrums because you don‚Äôt get what u want. Who‚Äôs the adult? Why can‚Äôt you act like one? I can‚Äôt imagine how you spoke to them as children. 

You were never nice to me not even good at faking it. Every day I lost more and more respect for you hearing the way you spoke to and tried to control your children and me included. It‚Äôs honestly about time you got the same treatment. 
You are genuinely not a nice person. i just finally have the balls to say it. 

 You will most likely never have a good relationship with ur kids as adults If u don‚Äôt realize how you treat people will reflect on how u get treated. You‚Äôll haven‚Äôt even even harder time finding someone who‚Äôs gonna kindly take care of you. It would probably of helped out in your marriage too. Maybe then you wouldn‚Äôt be blaming that on ur kids too when ur mood and how u act is all your fault. 

The way you act pushes people away. This will get you nowhere in life with people if you haven‚Äôt already noticed. Especially your kids. You act like you know everything and that your better than everyone when really your a very anxious, sad depressed individual who has no friends no social life no hobbies, skills or talents and a failing marriage all of which you literally blame on ur kids-that is psychological abuse btw. Speaking of psychological abuse‚Ä¶.

It‚Äôs not normal to feel that you cant go to the bathroom in the place that you live. It‚Äôs not normal to feel that you can‚Äôt eat or make food in the place that you live. It‚Äôs not normal to walk on eggshells to avoid shifting your mood one way or the other. This is the environment you create. You are an abusive person. That is the definition of abuse in multiple forms. You may not have ever said u can‚Äôt use the bathroom, but nobody wants to do anything to set you off in any way so if Me going to the bathroom or making food it‚Äôs gonna cause you to huff and puff and throw a fit. I‚Äôll just hold it til everyone‚Äôs asleep. Same thing happened with cleaning. I used to clean all the time when I first moved in. but you started complaining that you couldn‚Äôt find anything. You wouldn‚Äôt say it to me, but I hear you yelling downstairs that you can‚Äôt ever find nothing so I stopped. With the amount of hoarded junk in the house it is impossible to actually get anything clean. You literally told us to just clean around boxes of junk on the floor. You wonder why there‚Äôs mice and ants when ur headboard in ur bedroom is covered in food, food gets left out overnight, and ur bathtub is full of boxes. That‚Äôs disgusting. Good luck with the house checks doing that. 

Did you know there are studies that prove that getting yelled at can literally lead to physical health issues like cardiovascular diseases? You can literally weaken somebody‚Äôs heart and immune system by screaming at them nonstop. If you‚Äôre genuinely worried about your husband‚Äôs health. You should work on yourself there. Maybe he‚Äôd want to be home more. 

FYI It‚Äôs not your child‚Äôs job to talk to you because you don‚Äôt have friends. It‚Äôs not your child‚Äôs job to clean every square inch of the house after you because you didn‚Äôt clean up after yourself before you went to bed the night before. You put that on them like it‚Äôs completely their responsibility. 90% of the messes cole and I clean were everybody elses mess. I can understand wanting to help out, clean up after yourself but you expected us to do literally everything and u expected no one else to clean up after themselves. I kept track for over a month of what Cole did what I did what you did and what Bailey did in a day. I‚Äôll show you that if you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs actually crazy how much we ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt do‚Äù Since all but one person in the house works, Why is it that some people are required to do more than others? Why is it that some get to do less but they do enough?

 I‚Äôll tell you why 
Because you resent me so nothing I do is enough. Cole just gets punished by association

Btw Letting a toddler have free roam of the house while you sleep in the middle of the night isn‚Äôt great parenting. Best believe if I ever have a child that is related to you it will never be there alone like that with you. And u continue to act the way u do I promise you it will never be. You‚Äôre the one who said that if me and Cole have a kid he‚Äôs gonna be an asshole. Good thing you won‚Äôt have to meet it. See how there is consequences for what you do and how u treat people!

 I have said this to you before. I speak up when I believe things are wrong and you have kept my mouth shut for about four years too long because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have a say. if I spoke at all, cole had to hear it, I was threatened a place to sleep. I was told to go live with my mom. If living with my mom was as easy and simple as you guys make it out to be. I never would‚Äôve lived there in the first place. I never wanted to live at ur house. Me and Coles relationship struggled for years due to it. I didn‚Äôt enjoy a single moment. I didn‚Äôt feel safe I didn‚Äôt feel welcome and I never felt cared about. I‚Äôve been through more than I could handle in the past seven years, you have put me through more than enough, You have put Cole through more than enough. 


Btw If you want to continue to go around telling ur whole family how much of a bitch I am, I‚Äôll gladly show them my side of the story. Your actions have consequences and you can‚Äôt just go around talking crap about everybody because it makes you feel better. I will clear my name if I have to. I play petty games too.  

I have hundreds of videos of the way you speak nasty to everyone in the house over small things like garbage. I have a video of you telling Cole he can‚Äôt use the car for anything related to me the day before we were going to go see my dying dad then immediately retracted your statement the day after because of how fucked up it is was. You literally tried to keep me from seeing my dying father because you were mad that he was going. 

 I‚Äôve recorded almost every argument you‚Äôve had with cole. Every literal pigsty that I had to clean up that everyone decided to go to bed and leave for the next day. So please try and tell me I‚Äôm wrong I will prove myself to whoever the hell i need to. 

You love telling your side of the story , but you never tell the whole story. Or anywhere near the truth of the situation. You never mention how you act, or what you say that caused the situation to happen how it did. You had no reason to speak to me the way you did to begin with. 

I have been nothing but respectful and grateful to you. I‚Äôve been nothing but patient and given what u have put me through I have been exceptionally forgiving. I am no longer keeping my mouth shut with you. I will say what I need to say. You no longer have that control. I really don‚Äôt care what you think of me. You don‚Äôt think nicely of anyone. You hated every single one of coles friends until now. I have nothing but love for you Billy Bailey and everyone in Cole‚Äôs family but I will not however continue to be abused, taken advantage of, and controlled by people who anrent even related to me. You already drove your kids away. You barely see one grandkid. Why would you wanna make it so that you never see another? I‚Äôm not one to play childish games with grown people, and I do not respect mean girls that shit talk like they are in highschool that are well over 20 years of age. 

 Me and cole are very happy. So you are going to have to grow up let go and accept that. If you don‚Äôt that is u and Cole‚Äôs relationship that suffers. Not ours. If you can‚Äôt be friendly you will 100% get what you give. That‚Äôs life.

 ",TL;DR,2024-06-10,"AITA?:I am shunned by my partners family because I told his mother to croak  AITA: 
Backstory: I had a rough relationship with my mother in middle/highschool and eventually ended up sleeping in parks, outside or any friends house in the surrounding area for as long as I could. Eventually I met my boyfriend and started going over to his house for the majority of the day and leaving as late as they‚Äôd allow me. Eventually they noticed something wasn‚Äôt right and allowed me to stay until 10pm almost every day. One Xmas eve my mother and I really got into it and she started choking me out to where my Necklace cut my neck. At this point I left not planning to return. I snuck over to my boyfriends and spent the night in the outdoor basement on a metal chair with the spider crickets and stray cats in the middle of winter. Their neighbor had a camera that caught me sneaking in and alerted my boyfriend‚Äôs parents that some ‚Äúhomeless person snuck into their basement.‚Äù at this point they let me stay there, and I slept on the couch, went to every family party for 6 years. His family started to feel like the only family I had. 

I lived here for about four years. A lot of drama. His mother is some form of a narcissist alcoholic with no ability to ration or have a normal conversation. She made my life a living hell and everyone else in that house. She‚Äôd constantly tell him to grow some balls and get rid of me if he seemed upset and she assumed we were arguing. He was punished due to her resentment for me. She‚Äôd tell him to do something simple like the laundry and if he didn‚Äôt do it fast enough somehow it was my fault. She expected us to clean more than anybody else in the household and She expected me to clean up after everyone in the household. And I was still in my boyfriend was still reamed because I never did enough. When I started keeping tabs. I realized I did more than everyone combined. I kept videos and pictures and she was not happy about that. 

 She would scream loudly from downstairs telling him how I ruined him, how I have him by the balls and how much less of a man he is. That we‚Äôre just friends with benefits. If we ever have a kid, it‚Äôll be an asshole. She wouldn‚Äôt let him drive me to see my father who is in hospice because we had to take her car and she said that he couldn‚Äôt use her car for anything related to me and then retracted that statement the next day and said she never said it. 

She would talk crap about you loud enough to where she knows u can hear it but to ur face you are her favorite and she never say anything bad about you.  It only got worse and worse and worse the longer it went on, and I couldn‚Äôt defend myself because if I challenged/ questioned anything, she thought/did/said I was threatened a bed and a roof. Their ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù was used against me in every way shape or form. Not to mention, I was mainly referred to as twat/twatface. Almost always called out of my name. This is was a very dehumanizing experience. I felt like a stray animal stuck. Obviously one will snap eventually, and when I did, I lost it.She was yelling at my
Boyfriend to spontaneously fix something on her car she had never mentioned before because he started helping me do my oil. When he didn‚Äôt stop what he was doing immediately she started throwing out more tasks and yelling we do don‚Äôt do anything around the house. This started a fight between the two of them which somehow like always became about me. She had thrown out that I have ‚Äúdone enough‚Äù to her and now I started defending myself. I asked her what I do? I‚Äôm respectful even when I don‚Äôt deserve to be, I keep my mouth shut and I do what I‚Äôm told even when I‚Äôm being disrespected. She said she has been praying I disappeared since the day I started coming around and I out of a fit of rage told her to croak. I didn‚Äôt mean it, She shoved me around in the bathroom just prior so I was in fight or flight already. Especially being that this is already a traumatic environment for me and having come from a traumatic environment prior I wasn‚Äôt my healthiest most stable self. 

She then preceded to ‚Äúthrow us out‚Äù and we had one day to pack and leave. Now the family I‚Äôve spent the last 6 years with won‚Äôt speak to me and it‚Äôs very awkward. 

Everyone says it‚Äôs best to not even bother with the situation and to forget about it  but this is very much awkward uncomfortable and in a way traumatizing for me and me and my boyfriend have been together now almost 7 years and I‚Äôm very close with his family, I feel almost as if I‚Äôm reliving the abandonment from my own family and not one person believes she will accept any form of apology, nor would it do any one any favors. I have a huge letter written out for her that I was encouraged not to send so I‚Äôll put it here for more context- I know  its a bit rash but I‚Äôm very emotional - please let me know am I the asshole? 

Letter to his mom: 

I‚Äôve had enough of u pretending like you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Boy do I have years worth of shit to say to you. I know this is probably pointless, you have mocked every single time I have tried opening up to you. But all of what I am about to say needed to be said years ago. I am sorry I said a terrible thing, it was out of anger I didn‚Äôt not mean it and I do not wish that upon anyone. it is not my character to pretend I didn‚Äôt say it. But The way you all treated me was disgusting. The way you treat your kids and your family is disgusting. You literally brag about not reaching out to your elderly parents. You complain whenever somebody in your family calls or texts you. But they get mad when nobody texts you or keeps u in the loop.

 Tomina You have drained me. You have been terrible to me for the entire time I‚Äôve known you. maybe not to my face but I‚Äôve heard it all.  
I didn‚Äôt flip out and for no reason it was bound to happen sooner or later. I snapped. A person can only handle so much psychological abuse. I have done nothing to you except date your son and lose my home. I agreed with you even when u were dead wrong, I stayed away every other time you argued with cole, I walked away. I kept my cool even when I had my name thrown in the dirt for no reason other than your own resentment and hatred. And I know you must really hate me because you couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to come to my father‚Äôs funeral. And every time I tried to talk about it to you, you somehow made it about yourself. 

What do u get from being angry all the time?
 You create a very hostile environment. You‚Äôve made it so that I never felt comfortable to open my mouth about anything. 
If anyone in the house said anything that disagreed with you, especially if you are wrong. it‚Äôs a fight. That‚Äôs not healthy. 
 The one time I ever spoke up to you was to deescalate a fight between you and cole because I thought scream fighting about nuts was unnecessary and I was told I had to move out. How nice! You cannot admit u are wrong ever


I‚Äôm sick and tired of every single argument you have with cole actually being about me. You yell at him for literally anything and everything except for the real reason you are mad. Me. You have dreaded my existence since I‚Äôve been around. But we‚Äôre always too scared to say it to my face. You talk a lot of shit like you are bold but you are not tomina. I‚Äôve heard you say some terrible things about me then smile in my face the next day. That‚Äôs not bold that is a coward. You do the same to your kids. You say some terrible things to them and then instead of apologizing as you should, you buy them a bag of chips the next day. Real mature parenting. Teaching your children apologies aren‚Äôt important. Don‚Äôt own up to what you say.

16,1dc9muc,AITA for asking my GF of 4 years if we could go to her friends wedding solo ,"Hey everyone , first post here and this just happened and I really need some clarification as I myself feel a little conflicted given my GF‚Äôs response . About 8 months ago we were told by my GF‚Äôs friend from college that she was getting engaged and would love to have us at her wedding this upcoming August . I was excited as it is in Chicago and living in New England it‚Äôs a nice switch and I don‚Äôt get out past the surrounding states much . We have been talking about this for months and planning to stay a few days before and after the wedding to explore the city and have a nice romantic time as well as a blast at the wedding . Tonight comes up and my GF is having a planned call with the bride to talk about things and iron out plans on where we should get a hotel that is close to the venue , as well as just a chit chat about the wedding in general. I stepped out with her family for a boat ride ( we‚Äôre at her parents house for the weekend ) so she had privacy for her call. We all come back in and I ask her how the call went and she‚Äôs telling me how well it went . Then she tells me that the her friend told her in passing that her mom could come as well ( I thought just as a nice gesture ) . She then proceeds to ask her mom if she wants to come. Her mom initially says idk , then they start actually talking about it seriously and her mom is now seeing if she can get time off of work to go with us . After that , we were alone for a minute and mentioned I thought it would‚Äôve been nice for her to ask me if I thought it was cool if her mom tagged along first , seeing as we‚Äôve been planning this for a while and planning not just to attend the wedding but stay some extra time for a romantic getaway as well. She responded harshly and said if I want to ask my mom to come I will , and more or less chastised me for even questioning her and that it was mean for me to not want her to come if she could . I love her family , but we don‚Äôt get out for things together like this often due to school and money constraints , so I felt kind of disrespected and left out by this .

Long story short, he ended up telling me it would be better off if I did it myself because I don't have any purpose on this planet when I can't even stay in school. I started therapy soon after, but my ex would randomly snap my bsfs or try and hang out with them knowing it would get under my skin months after we ended. My ex then got a new girlfriend and at this point I was pretty moved on from him but seeing him with someone else threw me for a loop.

Quite often those people go first to one shop, then to the second, we know and cooperate with workers from the other shop as well, so everybody knows everyone etc.
It came to my attention that one of the employees from the other shop gives away vouchers for free stuff to one of our regular, which I thought I had a good relationship with. I made sure that both of them are aware that this is basically a fraud that's being taken very seriously by the company and it may get the employee in trouble. But I was pretty chilled about it, like it doesn't cost the company much and after all it's none of my business, so I only advised them to use these vouchers in the other shop, to not raise anyone else's suspicions or something.

Apparently not, cause few days ago I saw them in my shop using the voucher. I accepted the voucher but told them in a friendly, calm, like a worried friend to another friend way to not use them here.

I refused, and they got really mad. Both my siblings are picky eaters and wouldn‚Äôt eat healthy food anyways, and it‚Äôs not like our parents feed us healthy food for dinner either. Our parents make us very similar food to the stuff I make, or they bring home fast food.

It‚Äôs a lot of extra work to cook healthier meals that my picky siblings would eat and I really just don‚Äôt want to deal with the hassle. AITA?

Extra info: I‚Äôm not being paid for babysitting them all day, nor do our parents bring home healthy meals for dinner ",0.0,0.018571522,0,1
25,1dc8rgb,AITA for confronting my friend after she cut me from her wedding,"First time posting, sorry for any grammar and spelling errors. Advice is always appreciated. Hello to Vincey and The Click if you read this.

A bit of backstory

I (23 F) have this friend, Ann (23 F) that I've known since freshman year of high school. After graduating, we lost contact for a year due to moving cities before reconnecting again at a job. We agreed to move in together and few months later, her boyfriend (now fianc√©) moved in as well because his needed a place. Since both our names were on the lease, they needed my approval for the landlord to allow it, and even though I hadn't met him, I agreed. I even helped him find a new job.

Fast-forward a year later and the boyfriend got a promotion in a different city, the original plan was for me to move with them because, again, rent is high and I had nowhere else to go. Well, right as we were applying for rental houses, Ann changed the agreement at last minute stating that they would only let me stay with them for a year before I'd have to move out after I asked how the lease was going to go. I wasn't planning on living  
with them forever, but with the short time frame I wouldn't be able to save up enough to get my own place in a city I've never been to with an even higher cost of living. He was not aware of this change until I texted them in our group chat about declining to move because of the short time span. I was upset at the sudden change of plans, only because this was three months before our lease was up, but I found a different apartment with the help of a friend's family who would lease me one of their properties to me to keep me off the streets.

This whole time, they were planning their wedding and asked if I would be a bridesmaid. Of course, I agreed. I had known Ann for almost eight years and was becoming decent friends with the future groom. After I moved, Ann made a Facebook post about the wedding date being changed to this November instead of next year. Feeling confused, I messaged her about it so I could go buy a bridesmaid dress. Ann just says she isn't doing a bridal party anymore, but I would still be invited. Two weeks ago, Ann posted, once again, on Facebook and announced that invites were sent out and that we'd get them by the end of that week. That only fifty people could be invited and there was no reason for someone not to be invited besides not having the space.

I still haven't gotten the invite she had said I would get. I understand that it's her wedding, but both her and her now fianc√© expressed that they wanted me there, they wanted me to be A PART of the wedding, but now I'm not even invited to attend. I just feel used. I did so much for them, only for her to change plans that affected my living situation and not invite me to her wedding after previously being a bridesmaid. I sent a message expressing how I felt hurt and why I did, but she never responded and our mutuals started scolding me for it.

A little over a year ago B moved to our city, and my fiance proposed last June.

At first B was super engaged and involved; but when A proposed they throw me a surprise bridal shower she completely dropped the ball and left A hanging, I didn't learn this until much later but luckily had planned my own mini shower/brunch at my aunt's atelier, where the girls could also try on a few different styles/colors so we could pick their dresses! At first it was a fun day, but B's mood completely soured while we were trying on dresses; her critiques were so disrespectful and rude we ended the day early without picking a dress. I called her that night and she apologized profusely-- B runs her own business and explained that she took a financial hit recently and took the stress out on us. She also apologized to the rest of the party. A decided to step in and help plan the bachelorette weekend to help B out, but there was an emergency with my dress and B insisted A help and let her handle the trip to make up for the dress fiasco. I wanted a relaxing spa weekend away with my girls, which I am lucky to be able to afford and offered to supplement for anyone who wasn't comfy paying that much for a bachelorette party. I had already picked the hotel, B just had to handle booking and coordinating flights with the girls. I got so wrapped up in planning I just trust B to handle it. A month before the weekend, A comes to me in tears. She had noticed that B wasn't replying to questions about the party so she reached out privately. B called her hysterical and reavealed that work got so overwhelming she completely forgot to book until it was too late and that weekend was full, so she booked a completely different party (gambling, clubbing, etc) but was too afraid to tell me?? This is also when A tells me about the surprise party that never was. I'm obviously pissed, but like i said B is like a sister so I'm mostly concerned. I'm thinking this clearly isn't good for her mental health so I take her to coffee and basically explain that i understand she's overwhelmed and I want to take MOH off her plate so she can just enjoy the wedding and hopefully be less stressed with work. She first asks for another chance to which I remind her she's already had two. She then freaks out, accuses me of setting her up to fail so A could be my MOH instead, and storms out.

However during my mother's pregnancy with my little brother my father started cheating. He didn't have one affair partner, he was sleeping with every women in town. I caught him cheating 2 years ago when I was across the street my my girlfriend's house. My dad walked out of her parents bedroom with just his underwear on followed by her mom in his shirt. We both started freaking out and I called my mom to come over. My mom saw them through a window on the porch and took pictures and ended up serving him with divorce papers within the next 6 months. My girlfriends parents had a quicker divorce and her father ended up moving in with his parents who lived a town over. My mom let my dad live in the house for 2 years after their divorce! He moved into the guest bedroom and she stayed in her room. Around a year ago my girlfriend and I broke up and my mom started seeing her father.

We are both chronics, meaning we both have lots of pain and shit to deal with on daily basis. We both share a lot of the same issues such as arthritis and ADHD. But there's also things we individually struggle with (I have C-ptsd and fibromyalgia and she has severe hyper mobility).

For several years now, my friend has wanted to talk about her issues at least once every time we meet up. She brings it up in lots of random moments and I usually say something comforting and offer my help. I've also told her that I think focusing on the bad things and bad health, only increases how much it bothers you. Since placebo and Nocebo is a thing, I strongly believe you can think yourself more Ill by continuously focusing on your illness. But I understand it's not easy to get yourself out of that mindset.

Anyway, a couple of months back, I got cancer (again), and I have to go through treatment, (again) this time with a much more positive mindset. I try to be more positive, and it truly helps me through the treatment process.

My friend has continuously been talking about how she constantly feels tired, how everything is now much worse than it's been before, how her joints hurt etc. This is every - single - time - we talk. She asks me if I can help her with things such as moving her sofa and helping her clean, which I sometimes have done (we have both helped each other a lot through bad periods with e.g. cleaning.)

Yesterday I saw her at my place and when she asked if I could help her with cleaning her bathroom I said I couldn't, because I didn't have the energy and said I probably won't be able to help her for some time. She continued on to talk about how she hasn't been able to clean for a few weeks, because her joints have really been acting up and if I didn't help her, she would just have to wait until I felt better.

In a moment of (stupidity and frustration) I said to her: ""I don't understand how you can go out drinking with your other friends, but you can't clean. I think you need to start pulling yourself together and really try not to give your illness so much power. Because if you rewrite your whole narrative about yourself, there's potential that things will get much better and not look so glum. And maybe when you're out, you don't feel it as much because you're focusing on the poaitivea of being among friends.""

She got really angry and said I had no idea what she goes through on a day to day basis and I was extremely insensitive, and so she left.

Betty has another friend (14f) who  we‚Äôll call Abby. I really don‚Äôt like Abby. Betty talks trash about her all the time to me and brags about how she just uses her for money.



Anyways, Betty called me the other day and asked if I wanted to stay over the day before her party.

But whenever I was thinking about inviting a friend that she doesn‚Äôt know very well, she said that if I invited them, then she wouldn‚Äôt go.

32,1dd02vn,AITA for outing my GF's friend's new relationship?,"My GF (33F) and I (35M) went to a the wedding of one of her childhood friends. Becca (33F), who is my GF's best friend, and a close friend of the bride was one of the bride's maids.

Becca grew up in one of those conservative Christian families where God and family is above all else. Once you married someone, or had a serious relationship with them, you were bonded for life and there was no such thing as divorce. Becca was in a relationship with Dave for 10 years, they had two kids, but she was unhappy and wanted out. 

Becca finally had her limit in her relationship and left Dave. She told him she was leaving. Since she had no where else to go, she moved in with her parents and was forced to tell them. Her mom started crying because she was destroying the family and this was an affront to God. Her dad said he will get the minister to set up couples counseling for the them to get them back together. Becca stood her ground and said it was over.

Shortly after she left her spouse, she was contacted on social media by John, an old flame from high school. They started talking and one thing led to another and they started dating.

Becca has never been happier. However, because of her parents' beliefs and how they reacted to the news she was ending the relationship to Dave, she kept her new relationship a secret.

Now the night of the wedding. My GF and I arrive at the venue for 2:00pm, which is in the middle of the woods. It is remote and took us over an hour to get there. Once we arrived Becca came up to us and informed us that we ""couldn't leave before her parents"". Apparently, her new secret BF was coming to pick her up after the wedding and she was sleeping over that his place. Her cover story she told her parents as to why she wasn't coming home with her parents at the end of the night was because she was staying at our house for the night.

It is now 11:00pm. We have been at this wedding for nine hours. Becca's parents are still making the rounds talking with everyone and having drinks. My GF and I are sitting there bored and exhausted. We want nothing but to go home to bed, but we are stuck there because of the lie. I've had enough and told my GF I was going. We had an hour drive ahead of us and if we waited any longer, I'd be worried about the safety of my driving and since we were so remote, taxi and uber were not options. My GF agreed and she went to do her tour of goodbyes and I started packing up, getting ready to leave.

It's at this moment that Becca's mom came up to me and asked if we're leaving. I said yes, but then her mom asked me if she needed to get Becca's stuff for the night out of their car. I absent-mindely blurted out ""No, her new squeeze is coming to get her."" Here's the thing, I didn't even register what I said. Her mom just said ""Oh ok"" and walked back over to her husband.

I've known a friend, ""Charlie,"" for several decades, long distance friends, but over the years, I've come to realize he's a garbage person. While his wife was working hard to bring in all of their household income, Charlie started a mowing business. She paid all the bills while he was cheating on her with customers and strippers. He frequented strip clubs and even fell in love with some of the dancers. 

Charlie has been raising his two grandchildren since they were young. He sent them to a strict Christian school with poor education, pretending he was doing it out of the goodness of his heart, but he was actually paid several thousand dollars a month for their care. He never adopted them and didn‚Äôt get them any mental health treatment, despite obvious issues. Instead, he and his wife would whip the children for being unruly.

The younger grandson recently had a mental breakdown and was talking about lizard people. He was placed in a psychiatric hold, and while there, Charlie‚Äôs wife refused medication, claiming prayer was the solution. Charlie genuinely believes his grandson is possessed by demons and thinks prayer is enough to help him.

The older grandson, now 23, is homeless because Charlie won't let him stay unless he follows strict rules. Both grandchildren are obviously mentally ill, in part to genetics and high-potency marijuana they‚Äôve smoked for many years. The older grandson has been arrested for having Charlie‚Äôs handgun on campus  (He is not a student) and most recently for vagrancy. He‚Äôs homeless after all. 

Charlie's business, now operates with a partner who is an illegal immigrant, along with a crew of other illegal workers. Charlie undercuts competitors by not paying taxes, worker's compensation, or insurance. Has checks made to him personally that he cashes at the customer‚Äôs bank and doesn‚Äôt put it on the books, and puts the cost of goods onto other projects, further reducing his tax debt. Despite this, he professes to be a devout Christian. 

He collects damaged people to feel superior, including an indigent friend with terminal brain cancer, whom he makes beg for money each month. I never looked at things in their entirety but I‚Äôm getting sociopath vibes from this turd of a person.

I want to report Charlie to the IRS and state government for tax evasion and hiring illegal workers. I‚Äôm debating on telling his wife about his infidelity while she was supporting him.

40,1dcz36t,AITA for telling my dad I don‚Äôt care about his dog,"Last Monday I M38 found out that my dog has cancer. He went in the week prior for a tooth cleaning and to have some teeth pulled - we thought he had an infection in his mouth. Turned out it wasn't an infection, but a tumor. I've had my dog since my late twenties and he has been the most important thing in the world to me. I've done everything I can to give him the best life possible. He is turning 11 next month and I always just assumed he'd live longer, but stuff happens I guess. 

So, first couple days of the week I kept getting texts from my parents, some asking about the dog and some just about random stuff. I did not reply because I just felt stressed and did not have a lot of information. On Wednesday my wife and I took my dog to meet with an Oncologist where we got the final / more detailed news. It was probably the worst hour of my life listening to the Oncologist explain what is going on and what we are going to see happen in the near future. 

After many missed calls from my dad I finally call him back and tell him what I know - and he seems to care most about the fact that I ignored his texts. Specifically one where he told me he ran into a work/industry colleague at a work event and that person told him to tell me ""hello"" and I did not respond to that text. I don't even know the person personally that he was talking about, just that he is the president of one of my work's competitors. Anyways, I just end up hanging up on my dad. A couple days later my mom texts me to call her. I do, and she basically starts balling and talking about how she thinks their dog is going to die. So I sit and listen to her go on and on about how their dog isn't eating or drinking etc. etc. and she says a couple times that she's sorry about my dog, and we hang up. She did offer to help financially if we need it, which is very nice of course (I won't need the help though).

So all weekend, my parents are texting me play by play updates about their dog, and which vet they are at, tests being done etc. etc. and they are in my opinion very dramatic, but whatever. I find out that they are also texting my friend that works for my dad the same exact texts, so I have no idea how many people they are sending these too. And after each text they send me, they say ""How's Axe (my dog)?"" And I just don't know how to answer that dumbass question. Finally Sunday night, I flipped my shit on my dad and told him basically every detail I know about my dog, and that he's going to die etc. His response was of course to compare my situation to his, and how he understands what I am going through since he just almost lost his dog over the weekend. I told him that I don't have any bandwidth left and that I don't give a shit about his dog or how my situation compares to his or other people's. Then of course he flips out on me about how I have no compassion.

A few months later she was offered a great job opportunity in Mexico. She asked all of us that we didn‚Äôt tell her ex anything about moving from Europe to Mexico because she didn‚Äôt want him to know anything about her - bad breakup. 

Well, another friend came to visit this weekend and she is pretty close with the ex because they were childhood friends and since we all get along we all met on Friday for drinks. 

Not even 24h passed and he was telling his friend about the move. 

Kat was pissed. She asked if I told him anything or if I knew who did.
 I told no one but I agreed to do a little investigation since I‚Äôm the Sherlock of the group. 30minutes later I had the answer. 

My bestie (35f) decided that it was ok to tell this friend that Kat was moving away, even though she was explicitly asked to STFU. 
She called me claiming that she was super annoyed about the situation and that she didn‚Äôt think she should be cautious about talking to friends.
I told her that it‚Äôs perfectly fine to talk about her own life to anyone she wants to, but when it comes to other people‚Äôs lives she should definitely keep her mouth closed.

 Which is also something that happens every time she‚Äôs call out. Always plays the victim and only talks to people she can manipulate into taking her side and Because she is the ‚Äúsweet one‚Äù it‚Äôs quite easy for her to get away with anything. 

The fun part is that she never talks about herself. Only other people‚Äôs lives. 

Granted she doesn‚Äôt have much to tell since she‚Äôs been unemployed for 6 years (her parents pay for everything - again, she is 35 years old) and she never had a relationship so she doesn‚Äôt get the pain that comes from it.

She lives for giving advice and unwanted opinions even though she‚Äôs never had been through most of the stuff she‚Äôs advising on.

45,1dcycfq,WIBTA if I took my mom‚Äôs bike after my dad gave it to me?," So for context, my parents got divorced last year. In the divorce my dad took minimal possessions from the house. He took a basement couch, his chair, his office desk and their mattress and that was about it. Nothing else besides one of the smaller ladders in addition to his personal clothes and things. My mom has everything else. Even chainsaws and a bunch of extra storage stuff including all kinds of other things from the house. She is paying him half of what the house costs but she could sell it for a lot more in the future than what it just recently got appraised at. 

When they split up they had 6 bikes in their possession. My mom‚Äôs new mountain bike, the old mountain bike that is now my dads (they both agreed to give the old one to my dad when they were married so he wouldn‚Äôt have to get a brand new one and he could ride with her), my moms road bike, a fat bike for her and my dad, and a tandem bike. 
In the divorce, my mom and dad agreed that my dad could take his fat bike and the mountain bike that was his. This left my mom with her new mountain bike, the road bike, her fat bike, and the tandem bike. 
Recently my dad moved states and wanted to get rid of the mountain bike- he only wanted to take the fat bike with him. He was going to sell the mountain bike but asked me if I wanted it first and I said yes- I‚Äôll take it. Coincidentally, knowing my dad was moving my mom asked me if I could get ‚Äúher‚Äù mountain bike back. 

Well I brought it back to my moms since I live there at the moment while I‚Äôm waiting to move into my apartment for grad school. I thought my mom wanted it back to ride and maybe because she felt possessive/sentimental over it since she‚Äôs a big biker. That was not the case. She just wanted it so she could sell it herself and take the money for it. I asked her as a courtesy if I could take the bike for school and she straight up told me no that it‚Äôs her bike and she had the right to sell it. I got upset because I told her I didn‚Äôt think it was fair- that the bike was dads that he gave back for the purpose of me using it- not so she could sell it off. 
So AITA for wanting this bike even though it was previously mom‚Äôs? I‚Äôm about to go $100k into debt here at a minimum for school so something like this would be a big help. 

However, I might be the asshole because my mom is getting tight on money since the divorce and probably wants to sell it to help pay for bills. It is a more expensive good quality mountain bike. 

I don‚Äôt want to ruin my relationship with my mom so I‚Äôm thinking I just let her have it but I‚Äôm also upset at the shady-ness of her wanting it just to sell it rather than helping me out.

After that I got up and moved to another seat, but the whole thing has been bothering me for a day. Did I really lack manners? It just feels like she sat there to teach me a lesson when she could‚Äôve sat anywhere else‚Ä¶

49,1dcxgog,AITA for declining being my friend‚Äôs chief bridesmaid multiple times,"I'm a 23 old woman and my friend who's same age as me is getting married next month, my friend nd I have been friends for more than 7years, and have been there for each other alot. Her boyfriend told her his intentions for marriage this year and she told me and we've been excited. From day one she has been hinting that she wants me to be her chief bridesmaid. Now being a chief Bridesmaid is a huge honor and a role to not be taken lightly, I am more than happy to be hers but there's alot of reason why I decided not to accept.
1.) She is financially stable and her husband to be is also wealthy. I on the other hand am very much single and not financially stable in anyway ( I still live with my parents). The role of the chief bridesmaid has a lot of financial obligations to which I don't have the funds to handle. I don't even have the funds to prepare as part of the bridal train. PS: google Nigerian Weddings. 
   She is very aware of my financial situation and she hasn't tired to pressure me in anyway and would likely be willingly to assist but then it would feel wrong for me to accept financial help from her because she's the bride and she already has so much to spend on and it would be shameful that she still would give me money to make my own outfit and prepare myself.

2.) She is very temperamental and doesn't usually think through her words before lashing out, it's worse when she's stressed or when things aren't going well, the person closet to her gets to bare all that heat. I normally have a way of getting around her temper but for a wedding...., I'm a sensitive person and I do not tolerate being yelled at Unnecessarily. I don't want us to have issues by the end of the wedding because of temperaments and wedding gitters.

3.) I get the sense that her family at large would not be keen to having their daughters chief bridesmaid someone from another Tribe when she has cousin sisters whom she's close too and can do the job suitably. 

   She has told me multiple times that I'm her choice for her chief bridesmaid but I keep considering these factors and keep declining.
Her introduction/ Bride price was done last week where she told me she chose a close cousin to take on the role. I was glad that the choice had been made and all is well. 
   After that day, we spoke as normal and even hung out . But for the last 1 week, she has been giving me the cold shoulder and one word responses and even declined us hanging out before she travels to stay with her husband to be. Deep down I know she's upset about my declining the role, she hasn't spoken about it but it's obvious to me that she must have given it some thought and hence the cold behavior.
 
ALTA or am I right to decline.

50,1dcxbbc,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to tattoo at my cousins wedding?,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/1IW2zNmOIp)
So the last hours have been a lot
First of I called my mom and WOW she asked me again, this time very friendly, if I want to tattoo Matty at his wedding & *again* I said no, with all the reasons I‚Äôve previously given her + some of the very good points you guys had. Before she could say anything else, I added that I felt like she wouldn‚Äôt take me & tattooing seriously. She didn‚Äôt say anything for a bit until she tried to explain that she really thought it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I told her *again* that it is and that my mom of all the people should know how my job works. She agreed and apologised profusely. I then asked her if she‚Äôd like to attend and watch me work on a clients appointment and to my surprise she said yes! (Mom is tagging along tomorrow)

Now to Matty or rather his bride:
I finally got hold of the bride, let‚Äôs say her Name is Becky, and asked her about the *request* her fianc√© confronted me with. She seemed surprised as she apparently had heard from my aunt that I *made* them something for their new house. She assumed it would be a painting since I‚Äôm ‚Äûthe artist‚Äú of the family and it‚Äôs known that I also paint. I confirmed that, but that Matty has come forward with this out of the blue and that it‚Äôs not a good idea for many reasons. She agreed with me immediately (I think *she* does have tattoos) She thanked me for telling her as no one else did. 
Becky seemed really mad but she seemed to pull herself together.  (I would‚Äôve lost it)

I‚Äôm assuming Becky confronted Matt after our call because only 3 to 4 hours later I checked the family groupchat and there was a message from Becky:
 ‚ÄûThere will be no ceremony on the 13th as Matt and I decided we aren‚Äôt getting married. Matt and I have things to figure out so please text or call us tomorrow if you have questions, for the rest of the day we‚Äôll be on flight mode‚Äú

After dinner Becky called me and apologised for Matt again, she said it was a stupid idea of his and that he just thought it would be *cool*. She then informed me that she still wants me to fly over for the wedding day as she will be hosting a party instead of a wedding. Everything is paid for anyways and she doesn‚Äôt want anything to go to waste. I asked if they broke up ‚Äûnot yet, but I‚Äôm gonna stay at my sisters place until next week‚Äú. I‚Äôm assuming Matt hasn‚Äôt been too great but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll hear about it. (Apparently my brother and my mom aren‚Äôt invited lol)
My call must‚Äôve been the last straw but as far as I am concerned Becky is handling it gracefully and Matt will be okay too, I‚Äôm sure. So I‚Äôm going to a party but did I just make a new friend?

Thanks y‚Äôall for having my back!

I had to insist he pay the $800 racked up on the attached credit card during his last visit to the USA (he charged my birthday brunch, birthday present, and expensive bar bill then left). Mind you, his birthday dinner was $500 followed by a $3600 birthday gift and $2000 vacation right after that.

He's not American and doesn't live in the US. I don't feel obligated to send him the money. I'm not rich and this relationship got way too expensive for what it was.

53,1dcwvs6,AITA for not inviting my new husband to my sons graduation dinner,"AITA? 
Backstory. My husband and I met and married within 6 months so now I‚Äôve been married just under a year (about 1.5 years total relationship time). I have two children from a prior relationship, son (18M) and daughter (22F). 
Son lives primarily with us and daughter is out of the home. My ex and I have not been in a relationship for a decade. My son‚Äôs graduation from high school only came with 4 tickets. He chose to invite both parents, his previously mentioned sister, and another half sister from his father. My husband felt and verbalized to me repeatedly that he felt like he should be invited because my son lives primarily with us. I think he shouldn‚Äôt have expected a ticket because there were people closer to my son that couldn‚Äôt attend such as grandparents, aunts/uncles, cousins. 
For an after-graduation celebration, my ex organized a dinner reservations for 5 to celebrate my son. My ex did not include my husband. They do not know each other very well expect for an occasional hello. My ex has no opinion positive or negative about my husband as I don‚Äôt really talk to him unless it‚Äôs about the kids. My husband on the other hand does not like my ex. He gets upset at every phone call, text, or drop-off. My husband thought he should be invited to the graduation dinner and was very verbal to me about attending the dinner without him, so I made an additional reservation to include him. Honestly, I did not want him to come as it would have been very awkward having him there sulking and making conversations about himself when it should have been about my son. 
Graduation day came and he was persistently texting me for updates, pictures, and even asked who I was sitting next to. I sent pictures when I could but didn‚Äôt answer his questions because I thought it was unnecessary ( I was not sitting next to the ex btw). He was in a bitter mood all day so I communicated the least as possible so I could enjoy my son‚Äôs day. He did not come to the graduation dinner because he felt that I ‚Äúshould have formally invited him‚Äù and he ‚Äúwould never go out to dinner without me‚Äù. 
I finally got frustrated and told him that the celebration is not about him and to get over it. But he keeps bringing up that I hurt him and I don‚Äôt have any empathy because I don‚Äôt understand his pain of being left home while we went to celebrate. 
I feel like his complaint is more about me interacting with my ex rather than attending the graduation. 
AITH for not formally inviting him?
Also add that he has a 13 year old son that lives with us primarily. 
Also, when I did not answer promptly about who I was sitting next to, he text my daughter to send a picture of the dinner table üôÑ to see the seating arrangements.

Obligatory I‚Äôm on mobile so if the formatting sucks I‚Äôm sorry

I (22f) live with my roommate (23f) well call her Bella, we have very different schedules and outlooks on life. I work 50-60 hours a weeks on top of going to school part time so I can support myself. Bella hasn‚Äôt worked a day in life and is fully supported by her parents. To each their own while I have my own opinions about the situation it‚Äôs not fair for me to judge her and how she lives her life. 

Unfortunately since she doesn‚Äôt have a job,  doesn‚Äôt go to classes, or even even leave the house, she is in her room all day everyday. I just want the house to myself for a little bit. She gets alone time constantly because I am never home since I go to work and do 16 hour shifts regularly (yay healthcare). 

I have OCD and not being in a clean house is really upsetting to me, I would love to deep clean the house at least once a week but I can‚Äôt do it when she‚Äôs home. Something about cleaning everyone‚Äôs mess while the other person just sits in the room, playing video games, and listening to me clean without any help just makes me so irritated. It‚Äôs just a mental block that I can‚Äôt get past. 

I just want to ask Bella to just go do something and leave the house so I can get some alone time to clean and do the things I want to do without another person. Just for few hours once a week so I can blare my music and dance around while I clean without feeling like I‚Äôm being watched. 

WIBTA if I asked my roommate to leaving the house for a few hours once a week so I just clean in peace. 

TLDR: my roommate never leaves the house and I can‚Äôt clean with other people in the house. I want to ask her to leave a few hours so I can do what I want.

The two women have flocked to her where as I don‚Äôt pay her much attention. She also gosspied about me in the house to the other housemates.

She is literally pretending like nothing happened.¬† Every time she said Hello I would be mute so since then she has stopped speaking. I am hoping this continues because everything was perfectly fine until she moved on.

I overhead her talking about a coworker not acknowledging her so she has a thing about people not speaking to her and take offense if you don‚Äôt. My reasons for being quiet had nothing to do with her but now I am extra quiet with her for obvious reasons. I felt it was just disrespectful to come to me about that in the way she did and I am doing nothing different from the men in the house do.

Including me there are 4 women in the house and two men.¬†

The two women have flocked to her where as I don‚Äôt pay her much attention. She also gosspied about me in the house to the other housemates. When she confronted me I told her she has no right to tell me how to behave and I had an angry tone when I did it. I raised my voice and she went quiet. A couple days later she sweet talks me like I am a child (she is in her 50‚Äôs and I am 36) and tells me to let her know when I am done in the kitchen so she can cook. I didn‚Äôt do a thing and walked right into my room. As the weeks went by she continued to find ways to make me speak to her and for a little bit I played her game until a week ago. She is literally pretending like nothing happened.¬† Every time she said Hello I would be mute so since then she has stopped speaking. I am hoping this continues because everything was perfectly fine until she moved on.

I overhead her talking about a coworker not acknowledging her so she has a thing about people not speaking to her and take offense if you don‚Äôt. My reasons for being quiet had nothing to do with her but now I am extra quiet with her for obvious reasons. I felt it was just disrespectful to come to me about that in the way she did and I am doing nothing different from the men in the house do. I guess since I am female I need to be talking her head off constantly. Do you feel I am the asshole for completely cutting her off?¬†",0.0,0.051180869340896606,0,1

Basically, a few weeks back my partner accidentally spilled hot coffee on our laptop and unfortunately it was damaged beyond repair. I'm a masters student, about to submit my final dissertation, and I was basing that on a project I've carried out during an internship. I was exclusively drafting my report at work and had planned to continue from home (as the actual work is done) but I didn't get to do it because of the incident. It's since become clear we actually have to get a new laptop as I don't think I'm making enough progress while at the office, though I was really reluctant since money is tight (we were saving up so we could move). I told my mum and said she would help me out, and that I could go on Amazon and she would give me her card to buy myself a laptop. I agreed and we went through with it, but unfortunately right after I placed the order they blocked my account and cancelled it cause they said it was suspicious. I was really frustrated at this, and my mum said to look at other options for online delivery. The problem was, for most of the options I looked at the delivery took over 5 days, and I am meant to submit my dissertation in only 3 weeks. After realising that, I was super frustrated and told my mum that I would be going in person to buy one and see if they could offer financing options, but she insisted I look online or try to get them to send us a payment link or something. I explained that I didn't have time but I would ask for alternatives at the shop, thanked her, and then went over the next day to buy one. Thankfully they offered us financing which was super manageable and we bought a decent laptop, so once I had it I called her to tell her the good news. When she picked up the phone, she was crying and said I had hurt her, that all she tried to do was help and me and my brother only dismiss her (not sure what he had to do with anything). I was super taken back and said that I wasn't at all frustrated with her that I was frustrated at the situation, that I really appreciated her help but clearly with my time constraints buying in person was my best bet. She said she feels like a witch because we always say we don't want to bother her, that she feels worthless, and that she has learned her lesson that she has no voice in this family and will just shut up next time.

60,1dcvcha,AITA for arguing with my roommate over a spice?,"Throwaway account.

I am a college student sharing a flat with another girl in the same college as me.

For a little background, this house is under my name(not on lease). I've been living here for almost a year while she started living here around 8 months back. She lived somewhere else earlier. 

Now, the source of conflict is a spice. I hail from a different country. Naturally I only have one chance to go see my family and that is during one of the breaks. Living so far from my family, I feel very homesick. When I first moved in here, my mom gave me a lot of homemade stuff to keep with me. Like homemade sauces and a few spices that are not found over here. There is one such spice that is not found anywhere around here.

I have always cherished the taste of my native food items. You simply don't get the same taste here. So, I started using this particular spice very frugally. It is something that helps me whenever I miss my family. It is rather sentimental to me. I have it kept in a separate space to not be mistaken for a normal spice.

When my roommate moved in, I gave her a few rules to follow. Not to go into my room unless she takes permission, not to  go through my medicine drawer, and to not use that spice of mine. She agreed.

She is an aspiring social media influencer and posts videos of her cooking and all. Now, here is where things go wrong. She used a lot of my spice in her recipe(without asking me)I only got to know about it when I saw how half of it was gone. I almost cried. I confronted her and all she had to say was that it was indeed a rare spice around here and which is why it made her (new)recipe even better. 

I said she shouldn't have used it without asking me...heck, she shouldn't have used it at all. At this point, she also got up and started arguing with me. I reminded her how she has done it before(a month after she moved in. after she did it then, I had labelled the spice as ""\*My name\*'s spice. DO NOT TOUCH!!"". we even joked about the exclamation marks). I told her that she had crossed a huge boundary by doing this. She justified by saying it was just a spice. It is replaceable. Not a hill to die on. I do a lot of things that annoy her as well and she put up with it. I'll admit, at this point I lost my temper. I shouted at her. There was a whole argument between us. I will clarify any doubts regarding this argument in the comments. We haven't had a proper conversation since this went down.

I narrated this incident to my friends and was surprised when they all said that I overreacted and that I was an AH.They said I could just get another the next time I went to visit my parents or just buy it at a price that is 10x more than its normal price at some random website.

I also try to encourage him to branch out more if he's unhappy with his current situation, but it's usually met with ""I would never do those things, I only do what I like"" or ""I find everything boring unless it's what I want"" and when I tell him he's boxing himself in and then complaining about the box, that usually triggers a conversation that 9/10 ends up with him saying there's no point to him living anymore if he can't just enjoy life the way he wants, which frustrates me for multiple reasons, the main one being I don't like hearing him speak that way, I love him and him removing himself from this world would gut me, but also because nobody 100% gets their way or what they want in life and I constantly try and explain that, but it falls on deaf ears or is warped into another self pity parade.

63,1dcuyih,AITA For calling out my SIL for her cat's behavior,"My wife (34F) and I (36M) spent this past weekend visiting her sister, Meg and her sister's fiance, Kevin. My SIL and her fiance are preparing for their wedding this summer and since my wife is the maid of honor, we visited them so that the two of them could go over some things.

Meg and Kevin have 2 cats. One of them they regularly let out into their backyard, which isn't fenced. They just let her roam wherever she wants. While we were there, this cat brought back no less than 4 birds. Meg and Kevin just laughed this off as if this was a very common occurrence. They joked about their cat single-handedly keeping the bird population in their area in check, as if that's a thing that is ever needed.

However, at least 2 of the birds that their cat brought back were migratory birds. For anyone who doesn't know, a lot of these migratory birds are protected species. Yes, Meg and Kevin are not going after these birds themselves, but they seem to have no problem at all that their cat routinely takes down protected species.

I brought this up to them after the cat brought the 4th bird home. Meg and Kevin were joking about it as they did every other time and I finally spoke up. I told them that what their cat is doing is detrimental to protected bird species and that they are basically being willingly supportive of a neighborhood menace. I told them that if it was them doing this and not their cat, they would be subject to legal consequences.

Kevin, for his part, seemed genuinely surprised and said he never knew about such a thing for protected bird species. Meg, on the other hand, got extremely defensive and started coming after me. She told me I must hate cats or know nothing about them because this is just typical cat behavior.

I told her that if her cat is bringing birds home this often and they are doing nothing to stop it and keep letting the cat outside, they are either being willfully ignorant to what their cat is doing or are just being jerks by not seeming to care at all. I told her that I guarantee all of their neighbors who have bird feeders in their yards hate their cat. It's not like this is a normal part of the native ecosystem. It's a pet going after wild animals for sport.

Meg kept trying to defend her cat and it started to spread into personal insults against me. At that point, my wife stepped in and tried to calm things down. Meg wasn't having it and told my wife that next time she comes to visit, I should just stay at home.

On our way home, my wife actually got upset with me for calling Meg and Kevin out for what their cat is doing. She said I should have just kept my mouth shut since we were guests in their house and their cat isn't doing anything to anyone.

65,1dcuocg,AITA for not writing my mom's master thesis?,"
For reference I'm 20 and in my last year of a bachelor's degree. My mom is 50 and last year she decided to enroll in a master's degree in Healthcare and Social Services Management. She's the head nurse of a hospital in our town so she has some experience with management but doesn't have a passion for management or academia. 

Now she reached the end of her master's and she has to write her thesis. But she doesn't know how to write a thesis. She didn't even know what citing was until a month ago, she didn't know how to search for scientific articles. So she asked me for a head start, to write her first 3-4 pages and teach her a bit of academic writing. So I did that.

But she was still clueless and did not write anything. A week before needing to hand in her thesis she told me that if I write her whole thesis she will pay me. I said sure because it's my mom and I can't be the reason she fails. But  I am also caught up in my own uni work, language lessons and internships.

I have 15 pages done which is not even half way and she needs to hand it in on Wednesday. Today I had to work on an important proposal so I did that the whole day. I am burnt out and stuck between prioritizing her or my sanity. Writing a full master's thesis in a few days about a subject I don't even know anything about, in my mother language (not English) is not easy. 

So today I had a breakdown in front of her telling her I've been back home 2 weeks and all I did is work and I am going crazy. She just shrug her shoulders and said ""That's life"", while she was literally just submitting my own essay as her own for a course she has.
I now closed the laptop and I'm being stressed and confused. I don't want to write her thesis for her, it's tiring and making me slack on my own deadlines. I also feel like she just doesn't deserve that title for my own work.

So, AITA for not wanting to write my mom's master thesis?

UPDATE: I am aware I shouldn't have accepted more than giving her an academic writing guidance. My mom lives in a corrupted country where basically everyone gets degrees they don't deserve, so I felt bad to let her not get the extra money from the degree when so many people much dumber than her get even doctorates here.

I (20F) have been in the army for a couple of months, but I've seen enough to know that a lot of people have relations with A LOT of people. I met a female named Amber and we hit it off.

One night she invited me to go out and we met up with some of her male friends. She told me that she had sex with one of them named Jack but that was all she told me. That same night she was planning on having sex with his friend. So, I'm under the impression that Jack was just one of the males she was having intercourse with nothing more. I realized that me and Jack matched on tinder a couple months prior, but it didn't get anywhere. Fast forward a couple months later, Jack texted me on Instagram asking to hang out. We hung out and got to know each other for about a week. Amber found out that I was in communication with Jack. She never said she had a problem with me, but she clearly had a problem with the situation.

I feel like if she has ever actually DATED them, then they should be off limits.

We weren‚Äôt as close when we were younger so it was kind of fun having this new friendship. And it seemed innocent at first, but after a while the tone shifted.

I initially told him it would be a terrible idea to act on it since our families were so close and this would likely ruin our dynamics if it ended badly. His rebuttal? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it would end badly. I think we‚Äôre both pretty mature and imagine how happy our family would be if we got married or something?‚Äù I was dumbfounded. I‚Äôd never had someone tell me that with such confidence, but was I an idiot? Absolutely.¬†

I decided maybe the risk was worth it. To keep this brief, he and I snuck around, got caught by Margo, and the trip ended on an awful note where Margo couldn‚Äôt even look at me. She and I ended up calling a few days later to talk through everything. I made it clear to her that what happened between Adrian and I wasn‚Äôt a reckless hookup (because that would make the risk to our families completely pointless in my opinion). I ignorantly assumed that our long history together would have made Adrian view me in a higher regard‚Ä¶ or at the very least consider the situation we had put ourselves in.

Not even two-days later, I received a lengthy text from Adrian saying he thought we were moving too quickly and he wanted to end it‚Ä¶ I was speechless. I felt angry, betrayed, and humiliated. He made me feel like I was pressuring him into something when we hadn‚Äôt even had a definitive conversation on what we were. I also felt confused‚Ä¶ What was this all for?¬†

It‚Äôs been almost a full year since I last saw Adrian. My mom wants to put everything behind us and do another trip with their family this weekend, but the idea of being under the same roof with everyone again makes me anxious. Margo and I are on good terms now, but I‚Äôm still feeling weird about the situation and don‚Äôt want to make things worse.¬†

My sister (22) had a baby last year m(1). The baby daddy isn‚Äôt great at all. Refusing to watch him ect. 

Since I left my job a few of my older siblings have used this to their advantage getting me to babysit and do small tasks. 

When my sister went back to work she needed a babysitter. My older sister who is pregnant was doing it. Now that my sister is too far along 8 months and can‚Äôt do it anymore. 

I agreed to watch my nephew 3 times a week. For 7 hours at a time. 

I originally didn‚Äôt have an issue with this as I was at home a lot. 

Just this Friday I was asked to do something for my brother at his apartment my sister would stay there till I got there. 

I don‚Äôt go out with my friends or boyfriend a lot so on the Friday I was out with my boyfriend. 

My sister called and started shouting at me I said I‚Äôll be there in an hour. As I was on my way there she called me again shouting at me. 

As I go there she was nowhere to be seen. I went back up and went into his apartment and sat on the sofa whilst the electriton was doing the electrics.

On the Saturday my sister ignored me and didn‚Äôt speak to me.

Come the Sunday she calls my phone again to shout at me I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done find someone else to babysit‚Äù and hung up on her.

She called me selfish and a horrible uncle. I love my nieces and nephews dearly so this hurt me.

Monday comes around and I hadn‚Äôt heard from her. She called me at 11:00am I ignored it.

She texted me ‚Äúare you having him or not‚Äù to which I ignored.

74,1dcte4f,AITA for not understanding my dad?,"I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how I could be the asshole, but I'm autistic and might be missing something. English isn't my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes.

My dad went to the store because we didn‚Äôt have anything for dinner. The plan was to get baguettes, and sandwich buns for me. There weren‚Äôt any baguettes, so through the family group chat, we settled on wraps instead. My mom and I thought this meant wraps with vegetables and gyros for them (not for me as I‚Äôm vegetarian) since that‚Äôs how we always eat wraps.

When Dad arrived, he set everything on the table and called: ""food time."" Mom asked why it was already food time, and Dad was confused so I said the vegetables still needed to be cut. While I was grating carrots, Dad asked if I would eat wraps or sandwich buns. I said: ""What?"" as I didn‚Äôt hear him. He angrily repeated and accused me of making a face, which I didn‚Äôt, except maybe looking sleepy and confused due to exams and trying to figure out what he could have asked. I said wraps, and I guess my tone seemed rude as I thought it was a stupid question since I‚Äôm the only one who eats carrots on wraps so why else would I be grating carrots?

I know I was a bit rude in this next bit, which didn‚Äôt help, but I don‚Äôt think it warranted his reaction. After he raised his voice, I called him grumpy with a bit of an eye roll.

A bit of backstory on the horseriding bit: I've been getting weekly lessons since I was 7, a few months ago I had to switch to every other week due to a scheduling issue. Last week I saw a post on the riding school's Instagram about open spots in lessons, my lesson was listed as 8-16 year olds and there was a 16+ lesson open on another day. I would prefer to go back to weekly lessons and I was a bit uncomforable with my group having an age cap of 16 while I'm 19, so I asked my parents if I could switch. Dad made a joke about how it would be more expensive but he and mom did say it was okay. I want to clarify that the money comment was just a joke, we do not have any money issues and my parents have never spoken to me about possibly finding a way to make my hobby cheaper or having me pay for it myself. I also triple-checked if they were sure. So the horseriding can't be the isue.

Two years ago, I quit almost entirely, and have maybe 3-4 drinks a year, and only on special occasions. It's for a number of reasons, mostly because I take my health very seriously. I have never even been fully drunk in my life.

On Saturday, me, my platonic best friend Jay [28F], her new date [~26M], and a woman she was setting me up with [24F], were all hanging out. I had a very good time overall, we went to the guy's place and then to a karaoke bar. The guy was cool too, we were hanging out talking about cars after everyone left.

However, part of it has left a really bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively. When we arrived at the guy's house, he offered us mixed vodka that we said cheers to. I declined, saying I didn't want any, but he insisted. He said that we ""need to break you out of your shell"", and I reluctantly obliged. He then insisted that I try some orange juice/vodka. Later, at the bar, I (obviously) bought no alcohol, but he had me try two mixed drinks he got. I tried to decline but he insisted again.

Jay even ended up saying to me, ""I'm sorry he's making you drink."" I recognize that I could have (and should have) declined, but he was Jay's new date and I did not want to start an argument or conflict with him in front of our friend group.

79,1dcs34f,AITA for not going to my bff friends wedding,"I 23F my bestfriend 25F we got invited to her friends wedding this month and we‚Äôve agreed to go months in advance probs a year. We‚Äôre going to call my friend Ava. I got a new job due to being let go at my other job which works out great for me because I worked 12 hours over night and have 1.5 year old so I started working at his day care so we could get more into a routine. I took a pay decrease when I started and knew I had to save for my ticket for the wedding. Mind you I would also pay half for the hotel and part of the car rental. I kept asking Ava when she was going to book her flight so I could book my flight and get the same returning flight since I wasn‚Äôt flying out when she was. Like the next day I would fly out and stuff. But she never responded. Then says her mom & dad was going to pay for the flight. Mind you this was April. Flight was never booked nor talked about. So I had the day off because my son was sick. I went to bring my friend coffee randomly so we talked about the wedding and when I would come the rental hotel everything. She tells me her mom was going to pay her flight that weekend but they never got to it bc her mom was mad at her. Which got me to thinking whether or not I should go for real. I just feel bad for not going after promising to go but it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs my friend really.  I met her once when she was in town. We hit it off became okay like a n she was like an acquaintance really. But ever since she got married she said she would like me to be there and celebrate with her so obvi I said I was going to go with the intent of going. But since the wedding date is coming up soon the flights are well over $500 when I first looked at them they were like $250 and I personally don‚Äôt have the funds to go mind you I would still have to find a sitter in CO to watch him for the wedding. But Ava has been making me feel like a bad friend for not going and that she‚Äôs going to get her dress and that she paid a lot of money for it. But that‚Äôs not my fault. I voiced about the tickets and nothing was confirmed. I just feel like if we had bought our tickets when we said we were and pay for the other things we were going to need we wouldn‚Äôt be getting into this little ‚Äúfight‚Äù. So as of last week Ava was still going to her friends wedding. Now she doesn‚Äôt know how to tell her friend that she isn‚Äôt coming and that it‚Äôs my fault that she can‚Äôt make it. All in all we BOTH don‚Äôt have the funds. I certainly don‚Äôt when I used to make $3500-4000 every two weeks to making under $1100 every two weeks. We both got different bills to pay but she makes it seem like she‚Äôs ‚Äúdead broke‚Äù when she states that she has the funds she doesn‚Äôt want to touch any of it. Which I understand not wanting to touch it but you can‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm the bad person for not going to your friends wedding because we both don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúfunds‚Äù when really you do have it and can go by yourself.

I took a pay decrease when I started and knew I had to save for my ticket for the wedding. Mind you I would also pay half for the hotel and part of the car rental. I kept asking Ava when she was going to book her flight so I could book my flight and get the same returning flight since I wasn‚Äôt flying out when she was. Like the next day I would fly out and stuff. But she never responded. Then says her mom & dad was going to pay for the flight. Mind you this was April. Flight was never booked nor talked about. So I had the day off because my son was sick. I went to bring my friend coffee randomly so we talked about the wedding and when I would come the rental hotel everything. She tells me her mom was going to pay her flight that weekend but they never got to it bc her mom was mad at her. Which got me to thinking whether or not I should go for real. I just feel bad for not going after promising to go but it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs my friend really.  I met her once when she was in town. We hit it off became okay like a n she was like an acquaintance really. But ever since she got married she said she would like me to be there and celebrate with her so obvi I said I was going to go with the intent of going. But since the wedding date is coming up soon the flights are well over $500 when I first looked at them they were like $250 and I personally don‚Äôt have the funds to go mind you I would still have to find a sitter in CO to watch him for the wedding. But Ava has been making me feel like a bad friend for not going and that she‚Äôs going to get her dress and that she paid a lot of money for it. But that‚Äôs not my fault. I voiced about the tickets and nothing was confirmed. I just feel like if we had bought our tickets when we said we were and pay for the other things we were going to need we wouldn‚Äôt be getting into this little ‚Äúfight‚Äù. So as of last week Ava was still going to her friends wedding. Now she doesn‚Äôt know how to tell her friend that she isn‚Äôt coming and that it‚Äôs my fault that she can‚Äôt make it. All in all we BOTH don‚Äôt have the funds. I certainly don‚Äôt when I used to make $3500-4000 every two weeks to making under $1100 every two weeks. We both got different bills to pay but she makes it seem like she‚Äôs ‚Äúdead broke‚Äù when she states that she has the funds she doesn‚Äôt want to touch any of it. Which I understand not wanting to touch it but you can‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm the bad person for not going to your friends wedding because we both don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúfunds‚Äù when really you do have it and can go by yourself.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm atah but I am I ?

The other night she called me in tears telling me her partner has decided they‚Äôre having her shower at a club so they can have a DJ and open bar. I asked her what happened to the venue she had picked and she told me he vetoed it because he was inviting all his friends and family and that venue wouldn‚Äôt work for them. 

Now I‚Äôm sure some of it is cultural. Celebrations in his culture are massive parties. Our culture is more reserved and while we enjoy large parties we‚Äôre a bit more traditional when it comes to things like baby showers. 

So when she called me yesterday and started talking about the shower and how she was still upset, I suggested they compromise. Still have the music and bar but choose a different location. Still let his family make the food but insist you want certain decorations. 

She said no and that she would just get over it because this is how his family did things and that‚Äôs what things would be like in the future. 

By this point I was annoyed with the whole thing and that she was continually calling me to cry about it that I told her ‚Äúyou need to grow a backbone, he‚Äôs ruining your shower, speak up.‚Äù 

She must have said something because I got about fifteen texts from her partner this morning calling me everything under the sun and how I‚Äôve ruined their relationship and that my cousin doesn‚Äôt want to have a shower now.

83,1dcrxvf,AITA for Being Cold and Rude to My Former Friend After They Betrayed My Trust?,"(Preferably, I'd like this post to stay within Reddit)

Last summer, Matteo and Elena were my two close friends. Sometimes, I confided in Matteo, but to my dismay, he shared those conversations with Elena. This breach of trust became apparent when I jokingly confessed to Elena that I had a crush on Matteo, and she told him (I jokingly said that she could do that thinking that she wouldn‚Äôt do it), but he rejected me, causing some awkwardness, but nothing too serious. After that, we went no contact (me and Matteo). 

Things took a turn when I found myself in a terrifying predicament. A guy was harassing me, making me feel unsafe and vulnerable. Despite our strained relationship, I reached out to Matteo for help. He did assist me, but later, during a conversation about Elena (I was venting practically), Matteo said everything I had confided in him to Elena, damaging my friendship with her irreparably (we are no longer best friends).

I go to a summer camp with Matteo, and this was my first day. At the summer camp, tensions between Matteo and me were palpable (at least for me) from the moment I arrived.

Matteo: ""Hey there!""
Me: *silence, ignoring him*

Despite his attempts at friendly gestures, such as greeting me, I couldn't bring myself to respond. Throughout the day, I found myself snapping at him, unable to contain my anger and frustration.

Matteo: ""We have to go, lunch is over.""
Me: ""Why are you telling me this?"" (In a rude manner)
Matteo: *turns away* (This is directly translated from my native language and my dialect and with the dialect, it sounds way more rude)

Despite my conflicting feelings and the lingering crush I harbored, I couldn't overlook the betrayal I felt. During a project in the lab:

Matteo: ""We are too many people here.""
Me: ""So what? If you're going to complain, go away."" (rude)
Matteo: *retreats to a corner, disengaging and starts playing with his phone and talking from time to time with his friends* (Since last year Matteo always used to not help much with the projects anyway)

So, amidst the activities and interactions at the camp, my interactions with Matteo remained strained and filled with unresolved emotions.

As the day progressed, fatigue settled in, and my friends and I decided to take a break and sit down to talk.

Friend: *leaves momentarily*

Matteo, now playing with a ball, unintentionally hits me with it.

Me: *blurts out in frustration* ""Oh, for f***'s sake!""

Despite the outburst, my feelings towards Matteo remained tangled, a mix of resentment and confusion.

87,1dcrl7e,AITA Ahole for telling my boyfriend to choose between me and my friend?,"This story is a bit long and is quite the doozie, so buckle up for the wild ride. So for some context, my(18F) boyfriend (17M) has multiple personality disorder. He had I think 6, but two main ones. Each one has a different function in his life (Ex: protector, ECT...). I am dating the primary host out of the two hosts. We started dating almost 4 years ago and have definitely had a rocky path. He has cheated on me several times, well, one of the personalities did. I forgave him as it really kind of wasn't his fault (kind of was too though). And I had even let his other personality date another person despite me being uncomfortable with it. They ended up breaking up a few months ago. Now, this is where my friend (18F) comes in, we met back in 4th grade when she was visiting my neighbors and we have been friends ever since. Our friendship has always been long distance since she lives in Minnesota and I live in Kansas. Her and I both recently graduated and she is planning on moving here in about 2 weeks and living with my bf.

Now, this is where the story starts to spin a bit more. My friend and boyfriend have always hated each other since being introduced. One day I went to my boyfriend's apartment and he was on a video call with my friend. He said that he had something serious to talk with me about. Turns out my friend and him both had been repressing their feelings for each other by openly hating each other. He then asked me to consider a poly relationship with my friend where he is dating me and the other personality is dating her. I completely rejected the idea and he went on for over an hour about how good of an idea it was and how it would be beneficial for us. I reluctantly agreed to it even though I really didn't want to. A few days later I approached him again about the situation, saying that I wanted out.

This story is a bit long and is quite the doozie, so buckle up for the wild ride. So for some context, my(18F) boyfriend (17M) has multiple personality disorder. He had I think 6, but two main ones. Each one has a different function in his life (Ex: protector, ECT...). I am dating the primary host out of the two hosts. We started dating almost 4 years ago and have definitely had a rocky path. He has cheated on me several times, well, one of the personalities did. I forgave him as it really kind of wasn't his fault (kind of was too though). And I had even let his other personality date another person despite me being uncomfortable with it. They ended up breaking up a few months ago. Now, this is where my friend (18F) comes in, we met back in 4th grade when she was visiting my neighbors and we have been friends ever since. Our friendship has always been long distance since she lives in Minnesota and I live in Kansas. Her and I both recently graduated and she is planning on moving here in about 2 weeks and living with my bf.

Now, this is where the story starts to spin a bit more. My friend and boyfriend have always hated each other since being introduced. One day I went to my boyfriend's apartment and he was on a video call with my friend. He said that he had something serious to talk with me about. Turns out my friend and him both had been repressing their feelings for each other by openly hating each other. He then asked me to consider a poly relationship with my friend where he is dating me and the other personality is dating her. I completely rejected the idea and he went on for over an hour about how good of an idea it was and how it would be beneficial for us. I reluctantly agreed to it even though I really didn't want to. A few days later I approached him again about the situation, saying that I wanted out. He and I talked for a long time and he made me agree to wait until August 1st (2 months after this started) to try and get used to it. He also suggested I make boundaries.

88,1dcrkzs,AITA for telling my brother-in-law to stop drinking my beer when he‚Äôs over?,"My wife‚Äôs brother comes over to our place frequently as we have the same friend group and often he does not know when to stop drinking after he starts. He basically will try to chase the buzz and just keeps drinking even after others have stopped. For reference we are all in our 30‚Äôs. 

I don‚Äôt buy beer often but what I do have in my fridge is usually stuff I plan to drink and buying a six pack is something that takes me a while to get through. I have a couple different brands due to this and recently had just bought a new six pack that that still had several in it.

My wife and I have noticed he will initially ask if he can have a beer. I am always fine with him having it since he‚Äôs family and our company. After this though, he appears to take that and run with it. He stops asking and then continues to help himself to whatever beer he can find in the fridge. He does say he can buy me more but I find this beside the point. 

I usually have single bottles of different brands for when I feel like drinking them. Last night he drank five of our beers (different brands out maybe six total in the fridge) and it seems rude to just help yourself and say you‚Äôll buy more. In this instance yesterday, he finished all of the beer he brought and then moved onto ours.

89,1dcrk92,WIBTA for ignoring Bride & Groom request for Groomsmen to hem their pants above ankles? Feels like a joke‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôll be a groomsman in my brother‚Äôs 2nd wedding coming up in a month. I‚Äôve only met his fianc√© once so I don‚Äôt know how intense or relaxed she may be but I do want her to have a great wedding day. 

On my family‚Äôs group thread, my brother, the groom, and his fianc√© asked all the men to buy specific white tennis shoes, no-show socks and hem our pants above the ankles! Some jokes were exchanged about the odd look and I thought that was the end of it because this brother has always been a jokster at the expense of others (sometimes cruelly) so I assumed I could ignore it. 

However, he created a new message thread yesterday for only the groomsmen and reminded us that his bride-to-be is dead serious about seeing our ankles. Seriously? 

The fianc√© apparently works in fashion so I googled the look and I guess she‚Äôs in love with this ‚Äòshrunken schoolboy‚Äô style, as one NYC designer calls it. 

When I was fitted for the rental suit, I talked to the tailor and they laughed saying, 'We never hem that high but when you pick up, we will make sure they are standard (straight with no break).'

After I communicated this on the groomsmen thread, a longtime family friend & groomsman suggested altering my pants at the ceremony with clothes pins and an iron! This is starting to sound like Bridesmaid dress drama. 

I‚Äôve bought the white tennies which are not my size or style. I can buy no-show socks which I will probably never wear again. But if I draw a line at the high-water pants look would I be an Ahole? My dad and other brother are in the wedding too and both feel the same way. Please advise.

If race/culture info helps with advice: This will be an interracial wedding which is nothing new for my family as we currently have a couple interracial marriages with several biracial children & grandchildren. In this ceremony, the bride‚Äôs family will be mostly black, the groom‚Äôs will be mostly white and our families will be meeting most of us for the first time. I only mention this because I know styles vary between cultures. Pristine white tennis shoes, for example, are important in some circles. The bride and groom asked the guys to not wear the shoes before the ceremony to avoid any scuffing. 

UPDATES: 
I sincerely appreciate everyone‚Äôs input here! You have overwhelming votes that I go with the flow for the bride to make her day happy. And that is what I will do‚Ä¶ temporarily. I‚Äôm untucking the pant legs as soon as the dancing starts!

Thanks for all the advice about temporarily hemmed pants legs!! That double stick tape or basting stitch definitely sounds like the way to go. 

Shoe Questions: The brand, Banana Republic, doesn‚Äôt offer 1/2 sizes or wides in this style so my only option was to size up.

Former Bridesmaids: Yes, comparing high-waters to an uncomfortable bridesmaid dress on the surface makes sense. And that‚Äôs why I made the joke in the original post about bridesmaid dress drama. Groomsmen, however, are rarely asked to sacrifice comfort for a ‚Äòlook‚Äô which was obviously my hang up. I won‚Äôt be answering anymore questions on this stereotype because it seems to trigger a battle of the sexes.

91,1dcr3of,WIBTA for not giving money to family even though I could technically afford it?,"Throwaway account for personal reasons.

My (36F) MiL (59F) and SiL (21F) are often in positions where they need money. My spouse (35F) and I have given them money in the past because we 1. could and 2. felt guilty for having money when they don't.

My MiL is a recovering alcoholic and has been living in halfway homes for quite a while - a little over a year I think - but she often has to move because she has issues with the other people she shares housing with (read:  doesn't play well with others). She was living with her parents (my spouse's grandparents) until they sold their home and moved to another state and she then became homeless for a short time.

She can't work, lost her license to DUI, and has medical issues. We really struggle with the concept of her being homeless because we technically could afford to pay for some of her expenses. My MiL is, in my opinion, not a good person and constantly takes from others because she feels entitled. She does not respect boundaries and often causes fights/issues with family. We have a suspicion that she has BPD or is a narcissist (not super relevant I guess, just trying to give context to the relationship) based on her behavior. My spouse stopped living with MiL at the age of 13 because it was a rough home situation.

My SiL is a similar story BUT is actively working on trying to be better. She has two kids (3M, NB M) and is fighting legal battles for custody of her oldest. We offered to let her stay with us when she first became homeless but she chose to be homeless instead in order to stay with her BF who is the father of her NB baby (we could only get our landlord to agree to take her in, not her BF too). She did recently get her GED and her driver's license and she's helping her BF get his driver's license. Neither of them have been good with money and any we've given them in the past has gone out as quickly as it was given - we gave them money for Christmas a few years to pay for their rent and they spent it on fancy gifts for each other instead, then asked us for more money to pay for rent for context.

I'm more inclined to help out my SiL than my MiL but, would we BTA for letting my MiL be homeless by not paying her rent or helping her pay for an eldercare facility? I'd rather give my SiL resources instead of money, but would we also BTA for refusing to pay for her expenses?

95,1dcqtbs,AITA for arguing with my wife due to her and the kids staying out later than planned? ,"I'll start this off, by saying when the wife (F30) and I (38M) first started dating, she had two kids (currently 6M, 8M) from previous relationships, with neither kids dads being in the picture. As far as the youngest kid goes, for his first three and a half years he didn't know his bio-dad due to a restraining order the wife had.

Anyway, over the past year and a half, he's slowly been getting to know his dad, when he actually shows up for visits. Although those were a couple here and there, before he would go weeks/months without seeing the kid (usually when he didn't like something the wife had to say IE no to sleepovers after two visits).

I get with our youngest kids dad, being back in the picture, that means making compromises every now and then, so he can try and have a relationship with his bio-dad. I get that, I accept that, and I try to be encouraging about it, especially since I grew up not knowing mine and not wanting the kid to go through that.

As for why the wife thinks I'm an asshole, well over the weekend, she and the kids went to his place (well his parents place) so the youngest kid could spend some time with his grandfather on his dads side of the family (his grandparents decided not to be in the kids life, when the restraining order was put in place against their son). 

The problem is, we live in a big city, and they had to drive about 45 minutes out of the city to get there, but since neither one of us drive, her ex took them. Anyway, the wife asked prior to this weekend, if I would be OK with them going and if not they wouldn't.

We talked and agreed they would be home no later than 9:30 pm (meaning they would have had to leave around 8:30 pm), the problem is they didn't get back until 11:30 pm that night, two hours later than we agreed too. I was starting to worry (I did message her around 9:40 pm, that's how I found out they hadn't left yet).

So am I the asshole, for getting mad at her for not only coming home later than the agreed upon time, but also for not messaging me and letting me know, especially with her knowing I was already concerned with them going out there in the first place, given his history, like the reason he had a restraining order in the first place?",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-10,"AITA for arguing with my wife due to her and the kids staying out later than planned?  I'll start this off, by saying when the wife (F30) and I (38M) first started dating, she had two kids (currently 6M, 8M) from previous relationships, with neither kids dads being in the picture. As far as the youngest kid goes, for his first three and a half years he didn't know his bio-dad due to a restraining order the wife had.

Anyway, over the past year and a half, he's slowly been getting to know his dad, when he actually shows up for visits. Although those were a couple here and there, before he would go weeks/months without seeing the kid (usually when he didn't like something the wife had to say IE no to sleepovers after two visits).

I get with our youngest kids dad, being back in the picture, that means making compromises every now and then, so he can try and have a relationship with his bio-dad. I get that, I accept that, and I try to be encouraging about it, especially since I grew up not knowing mine and not wanting the kid to go through that.

97,1dcqls2,AITA For being causing my partner to cancel a date? ,"For backstory, I'm M30 and her F30 have been in a long term relationship for going on 14 years now. Over 5 years ago we decided to switch from monogamy to polyamory. The first year was a bit bumpy but after that its been pretty smooth sailing. Her and I have dated multiple people separate from each other over the past 5 years with varying degrees of success and reward, and we have always kept each other's safety top of mind when initially connecting with someone new outside of our relationship. Please save your judgment of our relationship dynamic, that's not the intention of this post or the feedback I'm looking for. 

Yesterday, my partner messaged me informing me that she met someone on an anonymous messaging app that lived in our area and that he wanted to meet her. I asked a few questions as to how long they had been talking and how comfortable she is with him. Here are the facts as she listed to me. 1. They had only been talking for a total of about 2 or 3 days 2. She only has his first name, no last name. 3. She doesn't have a phone number or any other identifiable information other than snapchat. 4. They did not call or talk on the phone or video chat either. 5. He wanted to meet her in a bar that's local, and when I say bar I mean just a bar, not a restaurant etc, and they were going to be meeting there at 11 AM today, a Monday. 

AITA for having alarm bells going off in my head and voicing my concerns to her about this? Just to be clear, I did not tell her to not go, I try my best to be supportive and not tell her what to do when it comes to other people she sees. However I most certainly voiced my concerns yesterday and then again today before she left to meet him. She ultimately decided against it and I could tell atleast part of her decision to not go was me raising the concerns I had. I know everyone has a different tolerance to risk and what not, but I just didn't think any of the information provided lended itself to being comfortable, confident or secure with meeting a stranger off the internet in this way.

100,1dcqfpe,AITA for not going to the hospital to visit my dad who has a serious heart condition ? ,"First of all, i‚Äôd like to apologize for any spelling mistakes, english is not my first language. 

So for a bit of context, I (19F) have a strained relationship with my father because he left us when i was just a baby. Throughout his marriage with my mom, he would cheat on her, be abusive mentally and verbally (idk about physically but i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised) and he was just overall a terrible husband. He was never a father to me even tho i would occasionally see him during my childhood and go visit him in his home country. He was honestly terrible at the whole dad thing and never tried to make an effort. He would constantly tell me i look fat and that i need to lose weight (mind you i was 9 at the time). He would terrify my siblings (23F and 21M) and once even grounded us for 18 hours straight bc he thought we were ‚Äúplotting against him‚Äù (we were out grocery shopping and wanted to take some particular snacks which he didn‚Äôt like). He praises himself to be a ‚Äúgood Christian‚Äù but never acts like one and is the biggest hypocrite, racist, homophobic and misogynistic man you could ever meet.
Growing up we never really talked or anything he would call for my birthday (which he could never get right and would call me by my sister‚Äôs name all throughout the call) but that was it. 
So, this morning he sent us a text telling us he was in the hospital bc of his heart and that we shouldn‚Äôt worry too much bc he was in good hands. i admit, i didnt feel anything when he told us his heart was failing. 
Then, my sister called me and asked me if i cared about the whole situation to lmk not to worry too much bc she had him on the phone and that he seemed okay. i told her i didn‚Äôt know if i cared and she hung up quickly. 
Later this afternoon, she called me again asking me if i wanted to go to the hospital with her to visit him and i told her i couldn‚Äôt bc i had to work (which is true). Again, she hung up really abruptly so i immediately called my brother and asked him if he was going (he also feels the same way about our father than i do). He said he was going bc no matter what, he‚Äôs still his father and the young ones need to take care of the older ones. I asked him if that made me the villain for not going and he told me that it wasn‚Äôt great then hung up bc our sister was calling him. 
Since then, i‚Äôve been wondering, am i the asshole here ? should i go see him ? i could use some advices please.

It‚Äôs also important to note she‚Äôs been very supportive of me going and totally understands, but is also very sad and cries about it whenever it comes up.

104,1dcpxfl,AITA for supposedly having 'too strict' rules for my son's devices,"throwaway for privacy

I (42F) have a son (15M). He has a phone and a PlayStation for personal use and a laptop for school. After summer break he's starting high school

right now the rules regarding his phone are the following:

* no phone for two hours after school school due to homework
* no phone after 10pm on Sunday until Thursday
* no phone after 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday
* max screen time of three hours a day on weekdays
* max screen time of five hours a day on weekends
* no tiktok (all other social media are allowed)

the rules regarding his PlayStation are the following:

* he has to follow the age restrictions on games. No exceptions.
* if he plays alone all applicable phone rules apply
* if he plays with friends it's socializing so there are no rules

recently my son started complaining that the rules are too strict but i think the rules are fair. He says that he's starting high school and that he is old and mature enough to know how to handle devices and internet. He also claims that all his friends are making fun of him because i'm treating him like a baby. I told him that these are my rules and he has to accept those if he wishes to keep his devices. Now he is mad at me because i wouldn't budge.

edit: thank you for all the advice  
So I've talked to my son and i decided that i'll get rid of all the rules under two conditions: the first condition being that I expect him to keep his grades up and if he gets lower than a c the rules will go back. My son has always been smart and he got A's and B's on his exams so this shouldn't be a problem for him.  
The second condition being that he has to get at least nine hours of sleep every night.

i told my son this idea and he said he could get on board with that and that he is grateful for the space i'm giving him. He also told me that i can trust that he'll take care of himself.

* he has to follow the age restrictions on games. No exceptions.
* if he plays alone all applicable phone rules apply
* if he plays with friends it's socializing so there are no rules

recently my son started complaining that the rules are too strict but i think the rules are fair. He says that he's starting high school and that he is old and mature enough to know how to handle devices and internet. He also claims that all his friends are making fun of him because i'm treating him like a baby. I told him that these are my rules and he has to accept those if he wishes to keep his devices. Now he is mad at me because i wouldn't budge.

edit: thank you for all the advice  
So I've talked to my son and i decided that i'll get rid of all the rules under two conditions: the first condition being that I expect him to keep his grades up and if he gets lower than a c the rules will go back. My son has always been smart and he got A's and B's on his exams so this shouldn't be a problem for him.  
The second condition being that he has to get at least nine hours of sleep every night.

i told my son this idea and he said he could get on board with that and that he is grateful for the space i'm giving him. He also told me that i can trust that he'll take care of himself. ",4.0,1.064345359802246,1,0
105,1dcpv2e,AITA for not supporting my sister more in her seperation?,"(Btw i'm autistic and this is already a nightmare situation because I have no idea what to do)

My sister is seemingly going crazy. She's separated from her husband and is now demanding to move out and get her own place even though they have mortgages on the house. She also wants to go out and explore and travel the world but they have two small children still in school. She's having rapid mood swings, first yelling at her husband (my brother in law), and then five minutes later being fine, and changing her mind saying its no big deal. Her best friend Angela has lots of money and will be moving abroad next year with her kids permanently, so is my sister worried about missing out or something?

My sister Kay (fake name) has always been a bit competitive and often wants to do what other people are doing, but also she goes through phases of being fixated on a hobby and then changing her mind and moving onto something else. (Possible ADHD) But she's not moving on from this, she's mad at her husband, she's mad at our family and we don't know what to do. my parents didn't give her money to buy her own place because they were worried she was making a mistake, but she's now ignoring them, saying she will no longer raise the kids catholic (my mothers religion) and is not taking up their offer to babysit anymore. She shuts down and wont really talk to anyone, and when her BIL suggested she go to counselling or the doctors to see if there's an issue, she dug her heels in and just completely refused to go.

My sister and BIL have been married about seven or eight years and mostly seemed happy, they met in the army, they did things together, and even though they were squabbles here and there they mostly seemed happy. She said they were separating out of the blue, and now she wants to move abroad and go on holiday and take the kids indefinitely. He's trying to get loans to help with the house mortgage so she can move out but because its not happening quickly enough she's getting mad at him.

she's also just stopped talking to anyone who might suggest she wait a bit and reassess in a couple months time. She's raging and has even said she's got to save herself. She says she's got to think about her to survive and is using a lot of dramatic language that basically implies if we don't support her in what she's doing, she'll block us all. I feel that she's being irrational and said as much, and she was angry I wasn't being more supportive. I am trying to support her but she's not reaching out to me at all. Plus, I have no idea what to do or say. She cant just jet off cause she has young children, but then again that hasn't stopped other people. I have talked to my BIL more in the past few weeks than I have to her because its almost radio silence.

Unfortunately i had to send it back and since we weren't sure how i would get my money back since it was done with combini pay, my friend offered to put her bank account on my account, get the money and then give it back to me slightly less because of exchange rate. Amazon japan didn't accept my debit card, thats why i cant put mine (i dont have a jp bank account either) and paid via combini pay.
I'm sending the package back tomorrow but today i saw a good offering for a bunch of kindles for only 770 yen (1800- my 1030 points i had from previous purchases) and i asked:"" hey could I use your card to buy it and then you take that amount from the money you give back to me or we can order now and i pay you back ASAP?"" I understand since it's her card on my account it's iffy so i understand if she'd said no. Which she did. But she said she didn't want to because if the return money wouldn't go to her account these 770yen would go to ""waste"", even though I said i would pay her back. We always do that for each other ASAP. Our other friend gave me the nastiest side eye so i decided to not ask again. 
No one said anything but i feel like an asshole because it is her money and even though i pay her back it can be uncomfortable. And i feel bad because in my head i'm angry.when i bought something different and had to get a 10k gift card because combini pay wasn't available she said she would help out the next timebut now she says it's too complicated.

107,1dcpdfl,AITA for arguing about photography in a public gym?,"I (19F) practiced lead climbing with my friend Shawn (19M) at a climbing gym. The way the gym is set up there are four walls devoted to two lead climbs each, then there is a row of six top rope/lead combination routes, a row of four top rope only sections, and the check in space. On the side of the gym parallel to that is the bouldering section. All of this is overlooked by a balcony on the second floor of the gym.

While I was practicing my knots with Shawn and tying into my harness properly as I wanted to be absolutely sure, another climbing group started preparing for a lead climb near me. Greg, the photographer, was someone I knew of from our college climbing gym and was going to be photographing Janja (not either of their real names) on her lead climbing attempts for his assignments and he wanted to make sure we were fine. He asked ""I'm going to be taking photographs for Janja's instagram and my college assignment, are you fine being in the vicinity?"" I said I was alright if it's just photographs but I was focusing on retying my knot and taking Shawn's tidbits on making the knot better. Shawn also mentioned that if he was on the wall he'd be fine being around a photographer.

Greg goes to the balcony. I prepare to climb, I make sure my checks are ready, and Shawn lets me go. I practice clipping so I spend a lot of time on the quick draws. I make it to four clips before Janja starts climbing a much harder climb. I'm practicing my technique on the fifth clip when I see a flash out the corner of my eye. This distracts me from properly clipping into the quickdraw and I fall down to the second clip. Greg takes more photos, somewithout flash, and Shawn lowers me. When Janja is done climbing I untie myself and walk up to the balcony and begin talking to Greg.

I explain that Greg didn't say anything about flash photography. It was the middle of the day and there was a lot of natural light so I'm not sure why he needed to use flash. Greg says he thought I said it was fine. I said I didn't give out good informed consent. He mentioned that I should have been paying attention. I said that I was focusing on my technique and that though I was fine with photos, I didn't think there'd be flash because he never mentioned anythign about it.

The argument kept going in circles and I left the convo. Shawn was sympathetic and a staff member came over to us. I explained how distracted and unsafe I felt because of flash photography in the gym with my perspective of lack of informed consent and the gym staff agreed. The staff member walked up to Greg and explaiend the situation.

Shawn and I later talked about my technique when Janja's belayer, Ai, said that we didn't have to involve the gym staff because the others were understanding. I said it didn't come off like that and Greg was unfairly dismissive. Ai said that that's just Greg and I'd know that if I actually talked to him before leaving.

My gf works in food service and I work in retail, we both try to take out the time to look through each other‚Äôs texts and reply whenever we can. However, when she‚Äôs back home, she is mostly asleep because of her depression (which I completely understand). But whenever I text her about my day or my plans for my art projects, I usually go in depth and spam her with texts sometimes. She said she is okay with that and that has always been how we‚Äôve conversed. But she used to spam text me too earlier, which I liked and now miss. Nowadays she usually responds to me late at night when she‚Äôs awake from her nap after work, which is when I‚Äôm finally asleep.

I‚Äôve been feeling more neglected because a lot of the times she doesn‚Äôt respond to some things that I ask her about and I have to bring it up 2-3 more times over the next few days to finally get a response. This irritates me because she either ignores those texts or responds to something else while I am actively asking her about something else. And when I excitedly send her multiple texts about something, she just brushes over a lot of the topics and chooses to respond to only 1 or 2 things after she‚Äôs done sleeping through the day.

I am getting married at the end of the year. When I was a kid my dad divorced my mom and she was a SAHM at that time. In short he felt like she was lazy and spending all his money. At the time I didn't see it and was quite angry at him.

He had us for weekends and the rest was mom. She had to find a job and worked long shifts. That would be fine if she didn't forget about us. She would get home and not help us with homework and anything.

It was my job to clean everything and keep my younger brother in line. It sucked. When I was a teenager I moved in with dad and my life got so much better.


Funny enough since I went full time and my brother soon joined she had to pay child support. She was pissed about that and basically stopped talking to us.

Anyways my invites for my wedding went out. One went to my aunt and I believe she mentioned it to my mother. I got a call asking about her invite

I told her she wasn't invite and this started an argument. I told her she was a pathetic parents and she called me heartless 


Edit: I have a few comments on this, my mom did not take care of us. She paid the bills but did nothing else. I was the one that made the home clean, took care of my brother, made food. I had to go buy groceries with dads money starting when  I was 10 so we could have a hot meal that wasn't junk.

Funny enough since I went full time and my brother soon joined she had to pay child support. She was pissed about that and basically stopped talking to us.

Anyways my invites for my wedding went out. One went to my aunt and I believe she mentioned it to my mother. I got a call asking about her invite

I told her she wasn't invite and this started an argument. I told her she was a pathetic parents and she called me heartless 


Edit: I have a few comments on this, my mom did not take care of us. She paid the bills but did nothing else. I was the one that made the home clean, took care of my brother, made food. I had to go buy groceries with dads money starting when  I was 10 so we could have a hot meal that wasn't junk.

He also went back for custody and got rewarded an extra day but overall I wasn't allowed to leave until I was old enough to force it with the court",0.0,1.039063572883606,1,0
112,1dcoszh,AITA Accommodation Costs,"My 2 friends (couple) and I travelled together and rented different places. 
They say that I must pay 50% of accommodation price if we stay in the same house/apartment as far as I have a separate room with bed as they do. I believe, it's unfair since:
1. Accomodation costs 80-90% depend on location. Same place far from city centre can be 80% cheaper. Thus, all 3 benefit from this including the aesthetics of a place, amenities etc.
2. They always pick a master room / room with bigger bed.
3. All 3 using same common space including bathroom.
4. Cleaning fee is a big % of costs as well: all 3 live in a place together etc.
5. It is my first time I am facing such issue with anyone. When we travel with friends and stay in 1 place, we simply divide costs per person no matter who sleep where and with who in the bed: except some situations when someone is in really disadvantagious position like sleeping on the floor.

113,1dcorg4,AITA for not babysitting my ex's children?,"I share a 12 year old son with my ex. We broke up amicably when he was 3 months old. We got along fine just after. We were both young and never really worked together and I have zero animosity toward her for the end of our relationship. We co-parented our son well over most of the last 12 years but for 3/4 years now we've had some issues.

Following our breakup my ex has had five other children by five different men and to the best of my knowledge not one of the men is involved in the life of their child. My ex is raising her other five kids alone without help and as of 2 years ago she lives in a different city and I have custody of our son, with her getting monthly visitation and more time in the summer.

I used to see my ex's kids occasionally and I'd try to be kind to them. But the more kids she had, the more she would ask for me to ""help"" with them and I put a boundary down because I did not want to encourage her to keep having more children and to rely on me for financial or childcare assistance. It started with her wanting money for her kids birthdays or a medical appointment and turned into requests for me to take kids overnight or for me to babysit for her.

She was made homeless two years ago after her former landlord sold the house she was renting and the new owner did not intend to continue renting it out. She left it too late to make other plans and when she was made homeless I was awarded temporary custody of our son, which turned to full custody once she moved to a different city.

Now my ex is asking me to babysit her kids during the day now that school's out and I told her no. My reasons are as follows: it's a three hour drive from her to me and I don't believe she's going to make that drive to and from here every day to pick up the kids, which means I would end up with her kids overnight. She also expects this for free which is another reason. And finally, she is pregnant again so doing this now only adds to the concern about her leaning on me to be a father to the kids she had with other men.

When I said no we had a fight over this and she told me to think of it as showing my son how to be a kind and caring person and giving her kids the chance to see him more than they do. She told me I need to man up and help her as the father of her first kid. And she laid a huge guilt trip on me which I think has made me question my no now.

Our kids aren't in diapers and are pretty self sufficient. We just needed an adult there to make sure they were okay. 

We talked to my mom and dad about it and they said that she deserved a social life.

My sister moved out to go home for the summer. My wife's family friend moved in. We made sure we told my parents about it so they could arrange for my sister to stay in dorms or rent an apartment with friends. They understood. 

My sister has gone nuts however. She is upset that I gave away ""her room"". That she didn't pay for and that came with free food, internet, utilities, and access to a car if she needed. 

She thinks we are being vindictive. I think we had a deal and her and our parents tried to change it. 


Maria, the girl staying with us has been great. She tutors the kids and we have to tell her to stop cleaning because we have a cleaning lady. 

Maria is getting four nights a week to herself and one weekend day. The exact same as my sister. We are helping her get a license so she can drive the kids if she needs. We will give her access to a car as well if we aren't using them. 

My sister is upset because she was going to use the money from her summer job as fun money for the year and now she will have to use it for housing, transportation, and food. She will also need a job during the school year so her social life will be impacted. 

I tried talking to her about it but she said I was being unfair and cheap. 

If we pretend we were paying her $25 an hour that would be 16 hours X $25 X 4 weeks $1,600 a month. 

Rent, all utilities, food, and access to a car for $1,600 is pretty good in our city. Dorms plus a meal plan will be more this fall.

Maria is getting four nights a week to herself and one weekend day. The exact same as my sister. We are helping her get a license so she can drive the kids if she needs. We will give her access to a car as well if we aren't using them. 

My sister is upset because she was going to use the money from her summer job as fun money for the year and now she will have to use it for housing, transportation, and food. She will also need a job during the school year so her social life will be impacted. 

I tried talking to her about it but she said I was being unfair and cheap. 

If we pretend we were paying her $25 an hour that would be 16 hours X $25 X 4 weeks $1,600 a month. 

Rent, all utilities, food, and access to a car for $1,600 is pretty good in our city. Dorms plus a meal plan will be more this fall.

121,1dcobnq,WIBTA DIL likes to show her cleavage too much ,"WIBTA if I (56f) tell my son‚Äòs (25m) wife(25f) to cover up on our next family gathering?
She is a big girl and loves to show her very big cleavage with very small tops. we have a hot tub and durinng family gatherings, all the young ones like to hang out after dinner in the hot tub.
Our family is a big Italian group and has a total of six adult males, and of course, they all stare at her. my son seems to be proud of this happening. He‚Äôs a very gentle guy and respects his wife‚Äôs decisions on What to wear. I have asked him in the past, And that is what he always says. Very proud of him.

It wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal really, but his wife has commented out loud, more than a few times,  of guys staring at her, without giving out names of who those guys are. 
She always makes a point to mention how people(apparently lesbians are attracted to her chest)  always stare her chest. In my mind., I am thinking of course because you wear those small tops! 
Reddit should I say anything to her?
How should I word it so I don‚Äôt cause conflicts with my son and her?

124,1dcnggd,AITA for making/letting my friends smoke for the first time under my watch,"I (17F) went to a party last weekend with two of my best friends (both 18F). 

My first friend, we will call her Theresa (not her real name), has been talking about her urge to smoke. Saying she almost took cigarettes from strangers, saying she wants to buy them and telling everyone that the next time someone offers her a cigarette, she will take it and try it. The problem here is that Theresa has never smoked yet. 

Theresa is very easily influenced by others, if she sees them drink, she will, and if they smoke, she probably will as well. She is very insecure, and will do anything to prove to people that she is a good person. She thinks smoking is cool and an experience she wants to have as soon as possible.

I have smoked before, and have been addicted for a short while. I started smoking myself when I was just 14 years old. The legal age for smoking and drinking is 18 (we live in Europe), but no one really checks id and some people just don't care, this makes it very easy to get alcohol and cigarettes while you are underage.

I have always told myself (and others) that I do not want to be the reason someone does something 'stupid' for the first time (drinking, smoking, ect.). I broke my own promise.

  
Last weekend we were at a party, and before we even entered the terrain, Theresa told me and my other friend, Anne, that she would probably smoke that day. Anne is disgusted by smoking, and told her that she would leave if Theresa even thought about touching a cigarette.

After a few drinks, we were all pretty far gone. I found one of my colleges in the crowd, who offered me a cigarette. That is when drunk me had a genius plan. I went up to Theresa with my lit cigarette, and told her that if she wanted to smoke today, this would be the one she had to smoke. I told her this because I have an enormous fear of a stranger drugging/misusing her in such a state. I would rather have her smoke in a controlled environment, then with some strangers at a party. 

She took the cigarette, and smoked it, I explained her how to do it, and she burst into a coughing fit. She was shocked and disgusted by the experience, and promised me she would never do it again. We shook hands on it.

Anne is now telling me I am in the wrong for even offering Theresa a cigarette and says she can't believe I am not disgusted of myself. I think I did a good thing, because now Theresa won't try it again and has had her first experience in a 'controlled' environment with trusted people. So AITA for giving her the cigarette?

At first I was upset by this because never once has he met us there to spend time with us or our kids, and I felt like he was just passing the babysitting off to my husband and myself on our ‚Äúdate night‚Äù, but I said sure why not since it‚Äôs a public place and not right to tell someone else not to go there. 

Having them there ended up putting a huge damper on our night. My dad is not super social, and was kind of stand offish to our normal group of regulars we tend to socialize with. He also doesn‚Äôt like dogs and kept making comments about the dogs being there. In addition to that, having my niece and nephew there caused a lot of drama in the kid‚Äôs friend circle. My niece is very bossy and instead of the kids being in one nice group like they usually are everyone was split up and divided, my kids both had moments of crying due to what my niece was doing, and I spent most of my time having to referee the group like I was worried about.

Last week they didn‚Äôt come and it was soooo much better. But my Dad just texted me they will be coming again this week and now I‚Äôm dreading it. WIBTA if I told my Dad this is interfering with my family‚Äôs tradition and our attempt at a date night, and we‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt come? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-10,"WIBTA if I told my dad to stop bringing my niece and nephew to my family‚Äôs Friday night out? Every Friday night my husband and I (both 34) and our kids (4&6) go to an outdoor brewery as our family tradition. We‚Äôve been doing this for about a year and a half now and are considered ‚Äúregulars‚Äù, we also bring our new puppy with us now. My kids have a solid group of friends that they run around and play with, and it‚Äôs awesome for my husband and I because it‚Äôs the closest thing we can ever get to a date night. His parents (both in their 60‚Äôs)  live over 3hrs away and mine (both in their 50‚Äôs) are an hour away but hate to leave their house, and also don‚Äôt like dogs, so they don‚Äôt baby sit for us either. It‚Äôs been almost 5 years since we‚Äôve had a night out together. 

Also on Friday nights my parents have my niece and nephew over to their house for a sleep over, they are 5 & 7. My sister and her kids only live about 10 minutes from my parents so they spend a lot of time together. But my parents rarely call, visit, or even inquire about our kids.

132,1dclmsi,AITA for not letting my boyfriend talk to his mom,"My bf 27m and I 27f got into an argument. We have been working on our communication as a couple as well as handling conflict better. We‚Äôve been together for a few years and plan to get married.

The other day, I accidentally saw a text from his mom about me- with several negative comments. I confronted him about this and he gave a me a vague response. I insisted he show me the text. 

The text from his mom was nothing like what he described it to be. It was a whole paragraph about our relationship. There were multiple statements about how my boyfriend is treated and things I‚Äôve said such as compatibility and claimed I said my boyfriend was ‚Äúnot good enough for me‚Äù which is 100% not true.

My boyfriend stated he was spiraling and needed to talk to his mom. He said he needed to vent and his mom was the only person. Like really? Why not a friend? Your mom??? I don‚Äôt get it.

138,1dcl1ji,AITA for avoiding DIL which resulted in the rest of the family excluding her and when confronted not fixing it ,"I will be as clear as possible, also on my phone.

This started about three years ago when my son married. My DIL, Jenny, is very opinionated and doesn't handle any slight well. She claims it is due to growing up and having to be very loud in order to have someone pay attention to her. She was in a family of all boys and during any issue she goes to 100% percent.

This is a problem, any time she has a small issue she will escalate it very quickly. This has caused about half of outing to be ruined. It's like she thinks everyone is out to get her and a small slight will set her off. She can never just keep her mouth shut. Everything needs a reaction from her.


A few examples, a mix up at Starbucks for her drink, a waiter seemed impatient, someone pushing past her. These situations at most need a polite request to fix ( like her drink) or just ignore. Instead she is just a dick. It is an awful feeling to leave and know I shouldn't step back on that place for at least 6 months.

I tried to talk to her about the issue and it didn't go well. I tried to talk to my son and nothing on that front.

So I stopped doing to small family events that she is invited to, I still go to big ones like holidays. My life has been better for it. People noticed and when asked I told them the truth. Overtime people stopped inviting her or stopped going to events.

She invited people to go to the city of the Fourth of July. Everyone turned her down. She asked around and it came back to me.

I got a call from my son telling me to fix this. That I am a huge bully and caused this. That his wife has been upset since and got in a few argument with family members.

I told him no, and I told him a while ago that her behavior was horrible. That this isn't my problem

139,1dckreq,"AITA for not celebrating pride month, as someone (technically) part of the LGBTQ+ community?","To preface, I (18F) absolutely do not have anything against the LGBT+ community. I have been an ally before realizing I count as part of the community as well. I also don't have anything against pride, but I'll go further into my feelings about it in the post. 

I have a fairly diverse groupchat, where like 80% of us are some flavor of queer. Recently, several friends have been planning to go to Pride. I was asked if I was going to go and used the excuse of being a boarding student and needing to travel back to my home country, but A (18F) insisted that in that case, I could go to the pride in my country and video call them. 

Now, I don't care much about going to Pride. I think it's important, and I'm happy that my friends are going. However, it isn't my thing. I'm an introverted person and social events suck the energy right out of me. I don't like putting emphasis on my orientation; I just want to exist and be treated as anybody else. 

I also don't feel very connected to the community as a whole. I'm 'only' on the aromantic and asexual spectrums, while preferring men. It's taken me a long time to accept this part of myself, and I'm still working on it. Furthermore, while I have faced difficulties regarding my general lack of/very limited attraction and interest in certain activities, I pass very well as your typical straight person, just with some ""quirks"".  I've found that I'm happiest just vibing and chilling.  

I didn't tell the groupchat all of this, only that pride was a bit much for someone like me. I didn't think much of it since it's a known fact that I'm a homebody. Later I dm-ed one of the people I'm closer to in the gc about not wanting to feel like my orientation is the focal point of who I am. They didn't agree with me though. Their point was that Pride was and still is a protest, and since I was technically part of the community, I had a responsibility to stand up for fellow queer people and fight for our rights, especially since my home country still had a ways to go. They also said that me not feeling connected to the community as well as wanting to 'fit into' usual society is internalized bigotry (???), which might've been them misunderstanding my messages, but I do see their point.

They've always been quite vocal about this and honestly, they're a bit of the activist type. I've never had a problem with this, and at times I'm envious of them having the energy to do all of that. But I think it's unfair that I'm \*supposed\* to feel certain ways about certain things, or that I have to be responsible for social change because of parts of my identity. Don't get me wrong, I have been a vocal ally and I've done my fair share of standing up for myself and fellow LGBT+ people. I just want to take things more low-key and live my life. My point of view is that, me being on the aroace spectrum is similar to me being Asian. I won't tolerate racism or bigotry, and I stand up when it matters, but I don't like the expectation of always being outspoken and being an activist. I'd like some different point of views on this - AITA for not wanting to go to pride, for various reasons? ",TL;DR,2024-06-10,"AITA for not celebrating pride month, as someone (technically) part of the LGBTQ+ community? To preface, I (18F) absolutely do not have anything against the LGBT+ community. I have been an ally before realizing I count as part of the community as well. I also don't have anything against pride, but I'll go further into my feelings about it in the post. 

I have a fairly diverse groupchat, where like 80% of us are some flavor of queer. Recently, several friends have been planning to go to Pride. I was asked if I was going to go and used the excuse of being a boarding student and needing to travel back to my home country, but A (18F) insisted that in that case, I could go to the pride in my country and video call them. 

Now, I don't care much about going to Pride. I think it's important, and I'm happy that my friends are going. However, it isn't my thing. I'm an introverted person and social events suck the energy right out of me. I don't like putting emphasis on my orientation; I just want to exist and be treated as anybody else. 

I also don't feel very connected to the community as a whole. I'm 'only' on the aromantic and asexual spectrums, while preferring men. It's taken me a long time to accept this part of myself, and I'm still working on it. Furthermore, while I have faced difficulties regarding my general lack of/very limited attraction and interest in certain activities, I pass very well as your typical straight person, just with some ""quirks"".  I've found that I'm happiest just vibing and chilling.  

I didn't tell the groupchat all of this, only that pride was a bit much for someone like me. I didn't think much of it since it's a known fact that I'm a homebody. Later I dm-ed one of the people I'm closer to in the gc about not wanting to feel like my orientation is the focal point of who I am. They didn't agree with me though. Their point was that Pride was and still is a protest, and since I was technically part of the community, I had a responsibility to stand up for fellow queer people and fight for our rights, especially since my home country still had a ways to go. They also said that me not feeling connected to the community as well as wanting to 'fit into' usual society is internalized bigotry (???), which might've been them misunderstanding my messages, but I do see their point.

They've always been quite vocal about this and honestly, they're a bit of the activist type. I've never had a problem with this, and at times I'm envious of them having the energy to do all of that. But I think it's unfair that I'm \*supposed\* to feel certain ways about certain things, or that I have to be responsible for social change because of parts of my identity. Don't get me wrong, I have been a vocal ally and I've done my fair share of standing up for myself and fellow LGBT+ people. I just want to take things more low-key and live my life. My point of view is that, me being on the aroace spectrum is similar to me being Asian. I won't tolerate racism or bigotry, and I stand up when it matters, but I don't like the expectation of always being outspoken and being an activist. I'd like some different point of views on this - AITA for not wanting to go to pride, for various reasons? ",,0.1586308777332306,0,0
140,1dckctr,AITA for going live on tiktok in spite of my bf telling me not to?,"I know it sounds really dumb, but I genuinely can't tell if I'm in the wrong or not anymore. For context, my boyfriend and I (20M and 20F) have been together for almost a year. I have a decent following on social media (200k on TikTok) even though I don't post much anymore.

Recently, I decided to go live on TikTok to talk about the upcoming elections in my country. I never go live, but I figured this was an important topic and wanted to use my most popular platform to discuss it. I told my boyfriend beforehand since it felt kind of embarrassing and i wanted to update him on why i was about to do it. He seemed weirdly annoyed but ultimately agreed. During the live, he kept messaging me in private to stop because ""weird men were flirting with me in the chat"". It's true, there were some men complimenting or trolling, but I didn't engage, and my mods and I were constantly blocking them. I also kept making comments like ""if you comment weird stuff you will get blocked"" to indirectly reassure him.

At one point, I got a compliment on my eyebrows and replied with a quick ""thank you"", then went back to elections. My bf saw that and started to argue with the chatter, asking me in private if I knew him. I didn't, but my bf went on his profile and saw it was a guy. He had no profile pic and a random username so i didn't know. He got really mad, and the chat got crazy, so I stopped the live. I didn't answer my bf's text right away since I didn't want to address it while live but reassured him in private afterwards. 

The next day, I decided to go live again since it was the day before the elections. I was on FT with my bf when I told him, and he got more annoyed, saying he hates it when I go live but that ""he doesn't care anymore"" and ""I can do whatever."" I knew he was upset, but I felt he was being unreasonable, so I went live despite his disagreement. Five minutes in, he called me, saying he can't take it anymore, initially claiming it's ""indirect cheating"" because of the men in the chat, but then admitting he's embarrassed because ""going live on TikTok is low-life"" and he can't have his gf doing that. He also said I was negligent toward his feelings for not pausing or stopping the live to respond to his messages the other day. He felt disrespected because not going live was a small favor he asked, yet I chose to be selfish.

I explained that I know TikTok lives are often associated with ""cringe,"" but I wanted to use my most popular platform to speak on elections and encourage voting. I apologized for not responding right away the other day, thinking it was best to wait until I ended the live, given that I was at peak viewers and mid-answering questions about candidates and it's rare that I use my platforms like that anymore. However, he still thinks I'm in the wrong, and I don't want to make him feel disrespected.

141,1dck4b8,AITA for getting engaged while my mother is terminally ill?,"Last week I (f36) got engaged to my partner (m27) of a year. We both know it's early, but we also both believe that when you know you know. Today, I told my mother that he had popped the question to which she burst into tears and I got an ear-bending about how selfish I am. 

For context, my mother was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and was given a year to live upon diagnosis. A year later, she is still doing extremely well with her health and there has been no change in the size of her tumour. As an only child, with no other living family, when my mum passes, I will come into a life changing inheritance.

My partner and I are incredibly happy together and have an extremely healthy relationship. We understand eachother, prioritise eachother, and navigate conflict well. As I have been married before and my ex took me to the cleaners in the divorce, I asked him for a prenup to which he immediately agreed and explained that he completely understands why I wanted one. My mum has met my partner several times and has said several times that she's happy that I have such a reliable and worthwhile man to look after me when she passes. 

That was until today, when she unleashed about him being a parasite and how selfish I am for getting engaged while she is still alive. According to her it is something for her to lose sleep over, but she won't explain why despite my asking. 

Since my previous divorce she has told me, many times, not to get married again. However I have always maintained that I would want to, should the right man come around. In my mind, he very much has. I can understand her being upset that she might not be able to attend the wedding, but we were intending to elope anyway. However, I would have thought that me having a stable and settled family of my own, when she passes, would be reassuring. But apparently it's not. 

The bollocking from her has been mighty, mostly revolving around how we haven't thought about her feelings before getting engaged. She has told me that she doesn't know me, doesn't like me, and doesn't want to hear from me again.

So AITA for getting engaged? 

Edit to address some of the common questions and comments that are popping up:

This type of behaviour isn't out of the ordinary for my mum. This is why it has taken me a week to tell her. She is a fairly typical narcissistic parent, and has admitted on a few occasions that she is jealous of my partners. 

My mother definitely has cancer and is having a scan in a couple of weeks to assess the tumour. She seems to have responded well to her medications and has gained weight since her diagnosis.

I know my partner and I haven't been together for too long, but I was with my ex-husband for 7 years before we got engaged, and he still ended up as my ex-husband. I don't think the length of a relationship determines how successful a marriage will be.

I have not yet enquired about a prenup as we've only been engaged for a week and wanted to enjoy the initial burst of happiness before starting the admin side of getting married. But when I do sort it, I will make sure that it covers my current assets and any inheritance to come. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-10,"AITA for getting engaged while my mother is terminally ill?

142,1dck001,AITAH for possibly un-inviting a friend from a trip?,"This year, I turned 21 and wanted to celebrate by taking a road trip to hike some National Parks in the summer. I don‚Äôt have a big friend group, but there is this one friend who I‚Äôve stayed close with and we hangout close to once a week. I asked her about a month and a half in advance if she wanted to come with me, and she excitedly said yes and told me she would start saving for the trip.

Two weeks before the trip, she texts me saying she won‚Äôt be able to meet up like we usually do, which I understood because she had a friend over who she only sees about twice a year because of school. Since she told me she wanted to come on the trip, I hadn‚Äôt done much planning because I wanted us to come up with things to do together and I didn‚Äôt know what her budget was so I wasn‚Äôt going to book anything she couldn‚Äôt pay for. 

The next week comes along, and almost as an insurance, I tell her we‚Äôll go out for food the next day so we can start planning our trip. She texts me back about 8 hours later explaining she‚Äôs still out for the night and would like to meet up in the afternoon instead. I comply and wish her a fun and safe time. The next day, she texts me asking to meet REALLY late in the day, because she had a friend over. I had already offered her a time slot and it didn‚Äôt work for her so I asked what time exactly we should meet and that I had to be home by a certain time. An hour and a half rolls around until my cutoff time, still no word, so I irritatedly told her what I had in mind and to call me if she had any questions. 

She texts me back around 8 at night apologizing about today, that she was emotional all day and that everything sounded great. (Also, she has a large dog who I changed the reservation for so she could come before I realized dogs are not allowed in either of the parks. I really wanted to discuss that in person with her so we could come up with a plan so the dog wouldn‚Äôt be alone the whole trip.

143,1dcjo6l,AITA for not making my ex (then GF) a t-shirt for my nonprofit?,"My ex and I broke up last September.  But neither of us have really let go or moved on.  I still love her.  She still has feelings for me, too.  We've talked about giving things another try.  Either way, we are still good friends.  To make this easier I will just call her R.

I run a nonprofit animal rescue.  Last year we set up at a lot of festivals and events in the community.  R got us our booth at our first big event.  She talked to the organizer and paid for it, as a donation.  She took time off work to help for all three days, too.  My sister and her two kids were helping also.  And I really wanted to be professional and do it up right.  So I had custom t-shirts made for everyone, with our names, etc.  Ours were all green and gray.  But I really wanted to have a black and purple one made for R since those are her favorite colors.  And her style is more unique.  I know someone who does those really fancy cuts on t-shirts.  I really wanted them to do a custom cut for R so her shirt would be really cool.  But there wasn't time to do all of this before the event.  So she didn't have a shirt.

I told her I would make sure she has one for future events, and that I really wanted hers to be cool and unique.  She was fine with it at the time.

My sister pretty much walked around for the three days and didn't help in the booth.  Her two teenage kids sat behind the booth playing on their phones all weekend, and R and I did all the work.  R helped at a lot of events last year and I never had her shirt made.  I wanted to but I just never got around to it.

Well, I was texting her last night and going through some clothes in my closet.  And I sent her a pic of my shirt from last year.  I said it's hard to believe it's been a year ago.  And she agreed.  But then she said she's still sad that she never got a shirt.

I asked her what size she wears and offered to make one for her.  She said it doesn't really matter now because she's not part of the team anymore and I don't plan on doing events this year like I did last year.  She said she felt really left out and told me I left her out of things like that a lot when we were dating. She pointed out that she did more work than anyone last year and never even got a shirt, and it made her feel like she wasn't as important as everyone else.

We are in our mid 30s, if that matters.

There's literally nothing I can do about it now.   I can't turn back time, and she's right, it would be pointless to make her a shirt now.  She said it's more about the principle than the actual shirt.  I gave out shirts to about a dozen people who helped me last year, and I never got around to getting hers made.  And she is the person who helped me more than anyone.  I just didn't think it was a big deal, but this really hurt her feelings and she kept quiet about it until now.

146,1dcjjsr,AITA for refusing my wife's food gifts?,"Get ready for one of the mildest AITAs ever, no big drama here.

My (35M) wife (38F) won't stop buying me food. Mostly it's snacks: chocolate, crisps, ice cream, but also microwave ready meals, oven pizzas etc. Nothing that involves cooking, but often perishables. I never ask for them, but whenever she goes shopping and I say I don't want anything, I can guarantee she'll come back with something for me anyway.

Over the years I've never really known what to do when she does this, so I typically thank her, then later ask her not to do it again because I don't want them. But I grew up partly in Hong Kong, where wasting food is just about the rudest thing you can do, and I feel compelled to eat every single grain of rice on my plate.

So after thanking her and then asking her not to buy me more, I then eat the food she buys me. Letting it rot and then throwing it away would be wasteful.

But she sees it's been eaten, so she buys me more - I must've enjoyed it more than I said, right?

We've been playing this game for years at this point. She buys me food, I say thanks but no thanks, I eat it to stop it going to waste, she buys me more.

Lately, having put on a fair amount of weight (not loads, but enough that I'm not happy with the direction things are going), I decided to cut down drastically on junk food and high calorie meals.

My wife said she'd support me in this, and so when I saw a microwave curry in the fridge, I assumed it was for her. Today, the expiration date having passed, she got annoyed at me for not eating the meal and wasting it.

Cue a sit-down discussion where I explained yet again that I don't want this food. I said that I feel a lack of control in my life, and two ways that this bothers me is that I never get to choose my own food or my own clothes (she also regularly buys me clothes because I never buy any for myself, but I never buy any because she's always buying me more than I need).

She's now not very impressed with me for refusing her gifts. I'm aware that this is just the way she shows love, but while I've tried to explain that this just isn't the way I want to receive love, still I've clearly gone about this in a way that has upset her and I don't know how to make my point (I'm a grown man, I'm perfectly capable of buying my own lunches) in a way that doesn't make her feel unappreciated.

155,1dcif9b,AITA for calling out my friends over their behaviour at my wedding dress appointment?,"AITA for calling out my friends over their behaviour at my wedding dress appointment?

I‚Äôm 25F, getting married to my fianc√©e 27M, next year. My best friend, A (25F) is maid of honour, and my friend, B (24F) is a bridesmaid, along with my sister and fianc√©es sister. 
I had a private wedding dress try on at a really lovely store close to where I live. My mother, sister, MIL, SIL, maid of honour and bridesmaid were present for this try on, as I was allowed 6 guests, and wanted them all to be involved. 
I have dreamed of trying on wedding dresses for a long time, and wanted a nice moment with the people closest to me. Instead, I was left feeling quite humiliated, embarrassed and upset after the appointment. I did end up choosing and buying a dress. 
Both my maid of honour (A) and bridesmaid (B), spent the entirety of the appointment, where I tried in different dresses and showed everyone (to ask for opinions and feedback), whispering to each other, laughing and offering no feedback or even a positive comment / compliment to any single wedding dress I tried on. Even when I found the dress of my dreams (that everyone ended up loving too! My mum cried), they didn‚Äôt say a single thing, even when I asked if they liked the dress. They couldn‚Äôt even pay me a compliment (and the dresses were nice, nothing outlandish or alternative, very normal, nice wedding dresses). The only time my maid of honour spoke was to exclaim that she heavily disliked a dress I was wearing as it was off the shoulder (a style she hates). That was it. 
I was quite embarrassed that my 2 closest friends were so negative the whole night, in front of my family. I felt heavily embarrassed and just really upset.
My sister and SIL mentioned their behaviour, and my SIL messaged my fianc√©e to tell him how sad she felt for me to have such negative friends, which prompted him to ask me what happened, as I had just brushed it off and didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal of it. However after speaking to him, he was quite upset on my behalf and said that if I felt comfortable, I should bring it up and ask them why they behaved that way. 
I did, very politely, ask them why neither of them paid me a compliment in any wedding dress I tried on, or just gave me feedback, which wasn‚Äôt received well at all. 
They didn‚Äôt think they had done anything wrong and had behaved perfectly fine the whole night, going as far as go say they quite enjoyed themselves. 
Am I the asshole for still being upset about this and calling them out on it? 


EDIT/UPDATE: sorry for the wall of text and not separating into paragraphs - I have never posted on here before.
I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone that took the time to comment and offer perspective. I very much understand that this may seem quite trivial and since it‚Äôs a wedding thing, no one really cares as much about this as me and my fianc√© (got the spelling right haha). 
For some added info, this situation was really just the breaking point for me. I was told after the fact as well that my bridesmaid was also picking dresses for herself the entire time, and was rude to my MIL. 
And for everyone speculating/asking - no, this is NOT the first time that they‚Äôve behaved like this. This was honestly very tame compared to some of the bullshit I have had to deal with from both of them. They can be very nasty and negative people, and have both been mean to me before to the point of making me cry / go low contact for a while. 
And again, I didn‚Äôt message them and ‚Äòcall them out‚Äô on any of this until I was approached by everyone at the appointment about it afterwards, as it was noticed by everyone.
And no, I didn‚Äôt make them come to this appointment- they all asked to be there, so I booked a private appointment to accommodate the amount of guests I had. 

I will be very much taking some time to think about these 2 friendships. And thankyou again to everyone who commented. I never call out bad behaviour or speak up about how I feel with friends as I often tell myself I‚Äôm being over dramatic / stupid (and I understand if you think I‚Äôm still being that way here!).

I‚Äôm 25F, getting married to my fianc√©e 27M, next year. My best friend, A (25F) is maid of honour, and my friend, B (24F) is a bridesmaid, along with my sister and fianc√©es sister. 
I had a private wedding dress try on at a really lovely store close to where I live. My mother, sister, MIL, SIL, maid of honour and bridesmaid were present for this try on, as I was allowed 6 guests, and wanted them all to be involved. 
I have dreamed of trying on wedding dresses for a long time, and wanted a nice moment with the people closest to me. Instead, I was left feeling quite humiliated, embarrassed and upset after the appointment. I did end up choosing and buying a dress. 
Both my maid of honour (A) and bridesmaid (B), spent the entirety of the appointment, where I tried in different dresses and showed everyone (to ask for opinions and feedback), whispering to each other, laughing and offering no feedback or even a positive comment / compliment to any single wedding dress I tried on. Even when I found the dress of my dreams (that everyone ended up loving too! My mum cried), they didn‚Äôt say a single thing, even when I asked if they liked the dress. They couldn‚Äôt even pay me a compliment (and the dresses were nice, nothing outlandish or alternative, very normal, nice wedding dresses). The only time my maid of honour spoke was to exclaim that she heavily disliked a dress I was wearing as it was off the shoulder (a style she hates). That was it.

157,1dchzbb,AITA for asking my siblings to pay me back for my portion of our trip?,"I (25M) have two younger sisters, Rebecca (23F) and Anna (20F). Last year, Anna suggested that we take a sibling trip with all of us and our spouses before life gets too busy.

At first we were looking at some place tropical, but Rebecca let us know that that would be out of her and her husbands budget so we began looking at somewhere closer to home.

We all pitched our ideas on where we‚Äôd like to go, but Anna and Rebecca ended up choosing someplace in Wyoming without asking my wife‚Äôs or my opinion. We don‚Äôt enjoy hiking really, but we didn‚Äôt want to rock the boat so we went along with it.

We then talked about doing it over the summer when weather would be nice. This of course wouldn‚Äôt work for Rebecca so we planned the trip for when would work for her which was the first week of October. We all pitched in to pay for an Airbnb, my wife and I paid slightly less than everyone else because we planned to stay for less time than everyone else.

Sunday, we started a group chat with all six of us in order to start looking at things people would like to do while there. My wife and I begin to realize that October might be a bad time to go and a lot of the things we‚Äôd like to do will be closed. We‚Äôre not against going on a few hikes, but it‚Äôs not what we want to do every day and is not our idea of a vacation like it is for the other couples.

At some point Rebecca‚Äôs husband sent a news article that the major roadway between our Airbnb and where we‚Äôd be doing the activities had collapsed with no schedule for when it would be repaired and any alternative route would be at least a 2 hour drive.
My sisters began looking at alternate lodging that would allow us to avoid the road and II suggested we maybe consider someplace different since we were already had to change our original plan. I threw out somewhere that was cheaper to stay at, better weather, and had a better variety of things to do. They disliked this idea and wanted to know where this suddenly came from. I let them know we weren‚Äôt very excited about this trip so if they were set on it then we would have to miss out this year.

Anna goes to cancel the Airbnb and we find out if we cancel our current Airbnb we only get a 50% refund. This made them even more set on keeping the original plan and just hoping the road is fixed in time, but I preferred to get 50% back than pay even more money in gas, food, and activities for a trip we knew we wouldn‚Äôt like at this point. So I  thought it would be fair if they split the cost of half of what I paid for the trip and that way they could keep their plans and I get the 50% refund I want.

Rebecca said I was an AH because I knew what I was signing up for when booking the trip so I should just eat the cost even though the rest of us have been flexible to fit her wants and she hasn‚Äôt compromised on anything even. And I‚Äôm not asking them to pay me back the entirety of what I paid either.

The next morning my mom is bombarding me with question and expecting responses to questions i dont have the answers too. she brings me back home and my step dad is still at the house‚Ä¶ she tells me ‚Äúim not taking his side‚Äù but moves on as if it didnt happen. i never got an apology from him or anything of the sort. i got a sorry excuse and past issues as to why me and my step dad stopped talking.After about 2-3weeks of ignoring him my mother then forced me to have a conversation with him where it leads to nothing because he doesn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt understand why i felt the way i felt. Time passes and im forced into another conversion and at this one my mother yells to me‚Äúi am so tired of you and this petty behavior‚Äù.

By the end of this conversion i convinced my mother and my step dad that all is right in the household and he is forgiven. In reality i still hold the same resentment that i had from day one and i dont see my heart or my mind changing anytime soon. 
So AITA for dismissing my step dad? ",,0.007216782309114933,0,0
163,1dcgr2u,AITA for telling my husband to find a high paying job or find additional job?,"My husband and I are already married for 4 years now. I have 2 high paying jobs and we have a lot of bills to pay; housing loan, personal loan, loaned items such as refrigerator, etc.

At first it was really okay since we can pay everything until one day he decided to join a specific hobby that requires a lot of money. I mean it's okay if he can pay it with his own money and if it's an extra out of our budget. The thing is, we are already living beyond our means.

I can barely do household chores since I'm already very drained with my 2 jobs. I asked him to find another job or might as well find additional job so we can continue buying what we want aside from our needs.

It's just too disappointing that he'd rather play video games than finding jobs while I'm working 16-20hrs a day.

I tell him he‚Äôs not being funny he‚Äôs being racist, he never gets it.

Today I went over to his house and we celebrated Father‚Äôs Day because my dad will be out of town next weekend. We were at a park and Peter made a racist joke, my dad laughed. I said that‚Äôs not funny, it‚Äôs racist and Peter said omg how and my dad laughed again and said yeah it was kind of racist. Later on when we were getting ice cream, Peter made a comment (loudly and laughing)  about how a person with Down syndrome was on the news and the news anchor apparently said ‚Äòwomp womp‚Äô ? Idk‚Ä¶but I said Peter you have got to keep your voice down and stop joking around about this kind of stuff, it‚Äôs not funny. Which, my dad agreed but then said it was because ‚Äòeveryone is so sensitive‚Äô. Annoyed, I said I disagree I think you should stop making fun of people in general and especially disabled people because it‚Äôs just wrong and mean. 

This is where I think I may be the AH because I started fuming here. So, my younger brother, Potato (8) looked at me and said ‚Äúwhat is Down syndrome‚Äù and as I began to explain, my dad cut me off and said ‚Äúso you know what it means to be re***ded right‚Äù and I cut him off and was like oh my God are you kidding me? In which he‚Äôs like what he knows that word I‚Äôm trying to explain it to him. I tell him how wrong it is to even use that word to begin trying to explain what Down syndrome is. Peter joins in, agreeing with my dad and saying extra ignorant things. I look at my dad and say where do you think he gets this stuff? To which he says, ‚Äúnot me I‚Äôm a CFO if I was racist and offensive I‚Äôd be dragged into HR by now, no one has a problem except for you, I wonder what that is.‚Äù Which I think he was implying because I work with disabled kids?? Idk for sure because he wouldn‚Äôt tell me what he meant by that. We argued for a solid 5 minutes and I was definitely being loud. Basically he was spouting off nonsense like saying he can‚Äôt even say the word black anymore and I called him an ignorant boomer. 

Poor little Potato went and sat in the car because he didn‚Äôt want to watch us fight. I was so frustrated i was in tears so I went and sat with him, then didn‚Äôt talk to my dad until I was saying goodbye. I feel like my dad was just gaslighting me, but still I feel kind of guilty.

((TLDR at bottom)) 

I (13F) work as free childcare for my two siblings and two cats majority of the week. I often have to be babysitting from about 9am to 7pm when my mother gets off work. My father, before leaving for work and 9, will make both my siblings (10F & 7M) breakfast, however I am responsible for both lunch and dinner, partnered with chores. My little brother, the youngest, is autistic and a nightmare to deal with. He'll often be very mean our two cats or both me and my sister. My sister is generally able to care for herself, spending most her time playing games in my room. However my brother has to be watched constantly. On top of the two kids we have two cats, once of which is somewhat unmannered and often bites people, while the other is very small and needs to be fed by a bottle. Even while dealing with this, im still expected to do chores and clean, often cleaning majority of the house on my own. The only day off I have is Sunday, however on Sunday I'm expected to do chores majority of the day. The reason for this post is that my parents do work long hours to put food on the table, and even with my work I've only received four dollars, which was soon asked by my father to be returned so he could get cigarettes. both my parents do work a lot, and we are very poor with three children, however I feel unvalued as my work is barely credited. My parents both have low salaries, and they struggle to put food on the table, however they're very emotionally unavailable and often just give my brother a phone then make him go away. 

TLDR: I babysit my siblings and two cats 6 days a week for 10 hours a day on average and am unpaid. Would I be the a** for asking to be paid even though money is tight?


Edit 1: yes, I do go to school, however it is currently summer break until August where I live. However I will likely have to babysit after school most days and on the weekend while in school.

170,1dcffwc,AITA for telling my uncle he deserves what hes going through right now.,"My uncle I won't use his name was like my big brother growing up he was one of the people i was closest with. But that all changed when my grandma passed away. You see when my grandma passed away, she left me her car it was a 2005 ford focus I think it was. Anyway, my uncle convinced me to give it to him because he said he would keep it safe for me and me having no reason not to trust him said sure because i couldn't trust anybody really to keep it safe. (My grandma didn't write a will saying it was going to me it was literally my word against most everyone although I've always been the favorite grandson cause i was essentially the first grandson to carry on my grandma and grandpa's last name.) He took the car (it was more of an SUV) and gave it to his adopted daughter that took his last name when he married his ex-wife whose daughter wasn't biologically my cousin and as far as I'm aware she doesn't talk to him after my uncles and her mom's divorce. (Makes me think that he cheated on her which he said they had a falling out but i dont trust him to tell me the truth.) It honestly does make me a fair bit angry that my uncle took what belonged to me for someone's gain that had no right to gain from my loss.

Long story short I have posted on social media about my uncle stealing my car and tricking me into giving it to him and how I lost and that's not what I'm posting about, I have since forgiven him for what he did, and we talk and we're cordial but I dont trust him and i never will after the past. Currently my uncle is homeless and he's living out of his truck with his kids because his ex-wife was evicted and he took the kids until she gets established and gets a better job, he would have had a place to stay with his girlfriend but thing is he went down to Louisiana to mess around with an old flame in Louisiana while he was dating his ex and his ex-even while Shes on vacation said flat out he can pound sand she doesn't care what he's going through.

My question is AITA for telling my uncle that he deserves this for what he did to me in the past and for the fact that I feel that karma is getting him back for what he did to me and not to mention I feel he's an idiot for cheating on his ex?

edit I was no contact with my uncle for about 6 years after my grandma passed. it was my dad who brought him back into our lives when we found out my half uncle had died, and the last remaining kids had to split the assets which were my uncle my aunt and my dad. but my dad kicked him out of our house cause my uncle wasn't paying any rent while he was staying with us, and he stayed with us for several months. (Granted I will say that my uncle helped us through a bad move, but he still wasn't paying rent, and honestly, I helped out a lot in the move and was essentially homeless myself for like a week during the move because of the fact we couldn't move directly into our new house, but I didn't complain I stayed in a hotel and made the best of it. I also did pay rent even after the homeless situation for a week my dad didn't give me a break in that scenario so I dont feel like my uncle deserved a break in that situation either. My uncle also makes 2400 in disability a month from what my dad told me so my uncle makes enough to get himself and the kids a place so that part isn't on me it's on him.

Long story short I have posted on social media about my uncle stealing my car and tricking me into giving it to him and how I lost and that's not what I'm posting about, I have since forgiven him for what he did, and we talk and we're cordial but I dont trust him and i never will after the past. Currently my uncle is homeless and he's living out of his truck with his kids because his ex-wife was evicted and he took the kids until she gets established and gets a better job, he would have had a place to stay with his girlfriend but thing is he went down to Louisiana to mess around with an old flame in Louisiana while he was dating his ex and his ex-even while Shes on vacation said flat out he can pound sand she doesn't care what he's going through.

My question is AITA for telling my uncle that he deserves this for what he did to me in the past and for the fact that I feel that karma is getting him back for what he did to me and not to mention I feel he's an idiot for cheating on his ex?

edit I was no contact with my uncle for about 6 years after my grandma passed. it was my dad who brought him back into our lives when we found out my half uncle had died, and the last remaining kids had to split the assets which were my uncle my aunt and my dad. but my dad kicked him out of our house cause my uncle wasn't paying any rent while he was staying with us, and he stayed with us for several months. (Granted I will say that my uncle helped us through a bad move, but he still wasn't paying rent, and honestly, I helped out a lot in the move and was essentially homeless myself for like a week during the move because of the fact we couldn't move directly into our new house, but I didn't complain I stayed in a hotel and made the best of it. I also did pay rent even after the homeless situation for a week my dad didn't give me a break in that scenario so I dont feel like my uncle deserved a break in that situation either. My uncle also makes 2400 in disability a month from what my dad told me so my uncle makes enough to get himself and the kids a place so that part isn't on me it's on him. ",2.0,0.9991521835327148,1,0
171,1dcffuj,AITA for not letting my kids ride 4 hours home with their grandmother?,"Around 1am there was a terrible crash as my (70f) MIL decided to try to navigate our stairs in the dark while wearing a cpap.   She tumbled down the steps, hitting her head bad enough to bruise her face and cause some serious swelling around her ear.  I immediately started calling 911 but my wife who is a NICU RN told me not to call as her mother had no obviously broken bones and didn't want to go.  I'm not a medical professional and it's seldom wise to argue with a nurse or one's wife but I pressed for them to at least let me drive her to the ER if they refused an ambulance but all to no avail.  This was just a couple of hours ago and she's now in the bed with an ice pack and a couple of Tylenol (to avoid blood thinners).  In the morning she wants to drive home and take my (9F) daughter and (13m) son to her place for the week.  This has been planned for weeks and I would have no issues with it but for the fact that the woman just fell down a flight of stairs and could have a concussion.  I love her and don't want her to drive at all and asked her to stay a couple of extra days but if she insists on going I can't stop her.  I told my wife I was uncomfortable with the kids riding with her given the danger and she thinks I'm being silly which I don't understand at all as she's a very competent nurse.  I finally told her that everyone could be mad at me but it simply wasn't an option.  I'll take the day off and drive them if I must but I won't take any chances.   AITA?

Update:  Well, my MIL was alive and conscious when we woke this morning.   My wife stayed up to watch over her through the night.  I spoke to my wife this morning and again shared my concerns regarding the dangers my MIL would be posing to herself and our kids and my wife was frustrated that I questioned her opinion but when I asked if she was so utterly certain in her diagnosis sans any medical equipment that she was willing to bet both her mother and our children's lives on it, she sheepishly relented and agreed the kids would stay home and that she would encourage her mom to go to the ER.  I spoke to my MIL again and asked her to let me take her to the ER, and she shared that her primary reason for refusing medical care was a fear of the cost of doing so.  Unfortunately, that's a serious concern of many folks here in the US. Anyways, hearing that, I firmly insisted she go and told her we'd cover any costs.  She and my wife finally went to the ER and after several hours and copious tests, it was in fact determined that she had a concussion as well as rib and wrist fractures and soft tissue injuries (bruising?).  My wife was pretty devastated with the diagnosis and was deeply apologetic and remorseful.  My mother in law will be in the hospital until at least tomorrow.  The hospitalist pretty directly chided both my wife and MIL.  All in all, I'm thankful that things didn't end up worse.  The kids only cared about their grandma being okay.

Some answers to questions asked:  

1. My MIL is a retired school teacher on a very limited fixed income along with my FIL.  There's no inheritance or other reason my wife would have wished her ill.  They have a great relationship.  My wife sprang out of bed the moment the accident happened and was almost detached and clinical at the moment but was later extremely emotional.  Her father had a major stroke last year, and we actually just sold our house Friday in order to move closer to her parents to help take care of them in their old age. 

2.  While my wife has been a NICU nurse for a decade, she was a stepdown ICU nurse for 8 years.  I realize that doesn't strengthen her case regarding her decision, but perhaps it adds context.  She really is remarkable with babies and has saved many a life, but I can certainly understand why the circumstances of these events would paint her in a less than beneficial light.  

3.  In retrospect, I think my wife was in a state of shock.  She's never lost anyone, and her dad's stroke is still fresh on her mind.  I've lost both parents and four siblings plus plenty of friends my time in the service, so I have to look at her through a lens of empathy.

172,1dcf591,AITA for siding with my friend about her husband‚Äôs unfair inheritance choices?,"My friend is married to a much older guy. They have two kids, elementary school age. This is her first marriage and his second. He has two kids from his first marriage (early thirties, both living with partners, established jobs, no issues on the monetary side, one has kids themselves).

My friend - let‚Äôs call her Irene - works in education (not a huge salary, but she does ok). Her husband - let‚Äôs call him Carl -  will retire next year (from a well paying job). They live in the home he bought before they met, only his name is on the deed.

They pool their finances for household expenses and she also contributes to the mortgage. 

With their recent marriage came the issue of organizing their affairs, among which was a will.

The problem was that Carl is deadset on wanting his inheritance equally split between his four kids and Irene. This means they each inherit 20%, regardless of their ages or situation, with no caveats about leaving Irene and the younger kids in the house while the kids are underage.

Essentially, Irene will have to sell the house to give each of the kids their share. Carl also doesn‚Äôt want to make different arrangements while his two youngest kids are underage, as he is adamant that they should be treated equally.

While this is fine on principle, the reality is that Carl will most likely be the first to die. Given his age (he is often mistaken for his kid‚Äôs grandfather) it‚Äôs not unlikely to happen while his kids are still underage.

The notary was a bit baffled by his choices, which he brought up at the meeting to discuss the terms. Irene had no idea this was Carl‚Äôs plan and she feels vulnerable, understandably so in my opinion.

The notary tried to suggest to Carl that it would be more prudent to set conditions about the ages of the kids, and perhaps also to (as is customary in my country) have the surviving spouse live in the house, which is then sold and distributed among the kids once that spouse dies too. Equally, of course.

Carl was not open to any provisions the notary suggested for Irene having some form of buffer while the kids are still at home. He all but called Irene a gold digger and said he was sure she was resourceful enough to take care of the kids, but that he had to think about 4 kids, not 2.

Carl seems to love all four kids equally. Sidenote; his older kids do NOT like Irene and that is mutual. They sided with their mother in the divorce (Irene met Carl after the divorce, which the ex and the older kids don‚Äôt believe). 

Irene came back from the notary crying her eyes out. I dropped off something at their house by chance and came while they were having an argument about Carl‚Äôs choices. Carl considers me to be a rational, intelligent person (his words) and asked what my opinion was. 

When I sided with Irene, he got angry and called me an AH ‚Äòfor not realizing that important life choices should be made with logic, not emotions‚Äô.

I pointed out his choices seemed illogical and potentially harmful to his two younger kids. He disagreed.

AITA?

EDIT - the amount of responses is overwhelming, I can‚Äôt reply to all of them. But thank you all so much for the suggestions! I will certainly recommend that she stops contributing to the mortgage unless they arrange for her to get equity out of this.
And the suggestions for a life insurance policy are also good ones, I think this may be an extra insurance.

I hadn‚Äôt considered the equality being found in the fact that he supported his older children in their education and likely will not be around for that time for the youngest kids (certainly the youngest of those two), so to make sure that this is taken into account when he wants it to be equal.

For those telling Irene that marrying an older guy with kids is her fault - well, the heart wants what the heart wants, I think.

Hey Reddit, I‚Äôm a 19M college sophomore living in a dorm. My roommate, Jake (20M), has been dating his girlfriend, Emily (19F), for about six months. From the start, I knew we wouldn't get along. Emily's the type who treats everyone like they're beneath her. She constantly talks down to me, belittles my interests, and makes snide remarks about how Jake should have a ""better class"" of friends. I've tried to ignore it for the sake of peace, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it‚Äôs unbearable.



Emily practically lives in our dorm. She‚Äôs over every single day, which means I have zero privacy. She leaves her stuff everywhere, uses my things without asking, and even ate some of my food from the mini-fridge. The final straw was last weekend. I had a critical paper due on Monday, and I needed some quiet to finish it. Jake and Emily decided it was a great time to blast music and have a mini-party in our room. When I asked them to turn it down, Emily laughed and said, ""Maybe you should go to the library if you need quiet. This is our space too.""



I snapped. I told Emily she needed to leave and that she wasn‚Äôt welcome in our dorm anymore. She got really upset and called me an asshole, saying I had no right to kick her out. Jake was pissed too, and now he‚Äôs barely speaking to me. Emily's been telling everyone that I‚Äôm a controlling jerk who hates women, which is obviously not true.



I feel kind of bad because I didn‚Äôt handle it calmly, but I was at my breaking point. I pay for this dorm too, and I feel like I deserve some respect and privacy. Jake argues that since he pays for his half, he should be able to have Emily over as much as he wants. 



So, Reddit, AITA for asking my roommate‚Äôs girlfriend to leave our dorm? Should I have handled it differently, or was I justified in setting boundaries in my own living space?

Aliya kept trying to matchmake them, but Fatima caught on and told her off. Aliya apparently got mad at this and lied that she is pregnant out of wedlock, which is considered an incredibly huge deal here, especially in the smaller towns.

I think I'd rather get blamed for being messy myself rather than it being stuck on the way I was raised for me it feels as though they are just flat out calling me white trash and that it should be expected of me to be this way.

This led to a heated argument between me and my boyfriend about this and led to me telling him that I felt wronged and that he was insulting me and that I'd rather be told I'm messy because I'm just an asshole or something and not because I ""wasn't raised right ""

So I'm at my boyfriend's house I tend to make the occasional tiny mess a few pieces of rice on the floor or carpet some ramen noodles on the stove something of that nature and the way my boyfriend and his parents explain it to each other is as ""they weren't raised right"" ""their house is messy so they don't understand ""
I think I'd rather get blamed for being messy myself rather than it being stuck on the way I was raised for me it feels as though they are just flat out calling me white trash and that it should be expected of me to be this way.

This led to a heated argument between me and my boyfriend about this and led to me telling him that I felt wronged and that he was insulting me and that I'd rather be told I'm messy because I'm just an asshole or something and not because I ""wasn't raised right "" 

He told me that that's not how he meant it and that I just need to calm down at which point I began to whisper yell because it was late and so he stormed off to the bathroom to "" be alone""

Me (20F) and my boyfriend (20M) are already in a long relationship for years, during this time we have taken trips.

I am sure that this was the beginning of her parents' dislike of me, I have never been disrespectful to them and I have always been kind. For a while my boyfriend and I had problems because when we entered university my boyfriend said totally unnecessary comments about the relationship and this caused us to fight a lot for a moment, plus I admit that I am also somewhat explosive and sentimental but I am changing for good; The point is, every time my boyfriend and I fought, he got so bad that he transmitted it to everyone around him. I suppose that increased his parents' displeasure. It didn't help that his parents treated him like a baby because he was the youngest and My boyfriend doesn't like to admit his mistakes to people so I guess maybe his parents thought something bad about me.

A moment ago my boyfriend got very upset because we had planned for him to come visit me at my house but my boyfriend told me he couldn't because his parents got angry saying that he was dependent on me and that I was surely forcing him when he of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãarriving was the.

184,1dcd0mm,WIBTA for refusing to go to my best friend‚Äôs second birthday celebration because it makes me uncomfortable?,"I (29F) have previously posted about this issue here but for some reason my post was deleted so here goes some context (sorry for the long post):

Helen (30F) and I have been best friends for about 8 years or so, we‚Äôve gone through many things together and have been there for each other through many heartbreaks and breakups. She has never really gotten along with any of my partners but we‚Äôve made it work. She‚Äôs currently single and just ended a year long relationship. 

I‚Äôve been dating Leah (29F) for 4 months now, we‚Äôve been friends for 14 years and just now started dating. I introduced her to Helen before we started dating and they got along great, she has also become close to other friends in the group. 

Helen started to act very weird after I began dating Leah, she started to spread rumors about her, separated from our friend group and basically stopped talking to me, after a couple months I managed to talk to her and she said that she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with my relationship with Leah, she didn‚Äôt give any actual reason, just said that she felt like I got into my relationship very fast and that she liked Leah before but now feels like she doesn‚Äôt deserve me, also that it made her uncomfortable since she was newly single and she didn‚Äôt want to hang out with Leah for now, I accepted this and we agreed to try to fix the friendship. 

It‚Äôs been a month and Helen just celebrated her birthday, she didn‚Äôt invite Leah. At first I was doubtful about going or not, I even asked here and was declared an AH for not going, the plan was to have lunch today and then go camping next weekend. 

I ended up going to the lunch today, even though it caused me a bit of a discussion with Leah, since she feels disrespected and doesn‚Äôt understand Helen‚Äôs position (neither do I tbh). I was very surprised to see that there were a lot of people there (around 20), mostly couples, from multiple groups of friends, Helen hadn‚Äôt even met some of the boyfriends/girlfriends before today. Helen, her twin sister and I were the only ones without a partner there, and I ended up lying to other people when they asked me about Leah because I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward for Helen. 

Helen was changing seats all the time to be with everyone, she ended up only spending around 45 minutes with our friend group from the 4.5 hours that we were there, in the end she decided to go partying with her sister and her friends and my friend group and I ended up going to a nearby cafe without her. I understand that it‚Äôs Helen‚Äôs birthday and she can choose who she invites and where she goes and with whom, however I‚Äôm now uncomfortable with the whole situation since it feels extremely personal against my partner and Helen is not even spending all of her time with us, she‚Äôs not even considering us for some of the activities so I‚Äôm not really sure how Leah‚Äôs presence could ruin her day, so WIBTA if I tell her that I‚Äôm not going camping because of how I feel?

Helen, her twin sister and I were the only ones without a partner there, and I ended up lying to other people when they asked me about Leah because I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward for Helen. 

Helen was changing seats all the time to be with everyone, she ended up only spending around 45 minutes with our friend group from the 4.5 hours that we were there, in the end she decided to go partying with her sister and her friends and my friend group and I ended up going to a nearby cafe without her. I understand that it‚Äôs Helen‚Äôs birthday and she can choose who she invites and where she goes and with whom, however I‚Äôm now uncomfortable with the whole situation since it feels extremely personal against my partner and Helen is not even spending all of her time with us, she‚Äôs not even considering us for some of the activities so I‚Äôm not really sure how Leah‚Äôs presence could ruin her day, so WIBTA if I tell her that I‚Äôm not going camping because of how I feel?

185,1dccyjw,AITA for telling my girlfriend is a horrible cook,"My girlfriend loves to cook and she even studied for about a year or two with a program relating to the basic of cooking.

But damn, her food is a hit or miss.
She can cook maybe 1-3 dishes that are alright but the rest, she cooks like crap. Either too salty or bland. 

So one day, I told her that her cooking skills are horrid and told her ""why are your cooking skills bad, I thought you love cooking? What did you even learn from the cooking school"" and I then ordered food. 

I've told her several times an honest feedback on her food. But she keeps saying ""it must be her taste bad, because she's used to salty foods""and still cooks the food crappily.

On my mind, if you love cooking and even had studied cooking, you would be able to adjust the taste accordingly.

186,1dcctpk,AITA for telling my wife I didn‚Äôt enjoy the birthday surprise she planned for me?,"My (36M) wife (37F) said she would plan something for my birthday. She asked if there was anything I wanted to do, and I told her no. At 36, I don‚Äôt have any expectations for my birthday.

We‚Äôve been together for 10 years, married for 7. We have 3 kids under 6, so planning activities can be tricky. Traveling is tough and staying in uncomfortable places with kids is stressful.

So my wife plans something, packs an overnight suitcase for everyone, and loads up our van. We drive 1h 45m to a small town, then take a long, rocky, narrow road to a tiny cabin Airbnb in a remote, heavily wooded area. It‚Äôs a single room with a galley kitchen, one bed, and a pullout couch. It‚Äôs cramped with three kids. There‚Äôs not much to do, no walking trails, and nowhere to drive except back on that awful road. I'm asked to drive back to get dinner from a nearby bar.

I‚Äôm surprised, and not in a good way. I don‚Äôt say anything bad about the property, but I can‚Äôt hide my feelings and she can tell I‚Äôm not a fan. We unpack, walk around, she has some gifts for me to open in front of the kids. We have cake and then spend 4-5 hours trying to pass the time. (The highlight is sneaking in a quickie in the outdoor bathtub.) After that, we go through the tiresome routine of getting all three kids to sleep, which is extra hard in a tiny cabin. BTW I sleep on an air mattress because our youngest co-sleeps and needs Mom at night.

We wake up early because the cabin has no curtains. My wife tells me we're going to do a 5k bubble and color run. I smile and say ‚ÄúOoook let‚Äôs do it,‚Äù not wanting to sound disappointed but probably failing to hide it. I‚Äôm not a runner, I‚Äôve never said I wanted to run, but whatever, let‚Äôs try it. We pack up and head to the event.

It‚Äôs a small, cheap event on a hot day. Our two youngest don‚Äôt want to do this, but we start the race anyway. Our oldest takes off, causing us to lose him twice. I frantically try to catch up, ending up sweaty, winded, and with aching knees. Not fun.

After my wife finishes with our other 2 kids, we walk around a small street fair and let the kids play. It‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm ready to rest. My wife tells me we‚Äôre supposed to meet friends at the beach later, so we have a 2-hour drive back, hoping the kids nap in the car. I take a nap, feeling quiet and not in a good mood.

We get to the beach and two of our kids start melting down. I‚Äôm done with the day and would prefer to be home. Eventually they chill, we find some shade and it‚Äôs fine.

When we get home, it‚Äôs a mad dash to get the kids showered and in bed, while I unpack, clean the car and house. My wife asks what‚Äôs wrong, and I tell her I appreciate her effort, but it didn‚Äôt feel like she planned it with me in mind. I don‚Äôt like running, I want comfort when traveling with the kids, and it was exhausting. It was a lot of effort for something not enjoyable.

She flips out, devastated that I didn‚Äôt enjoy it and angry at me for not ‚Äújust being grateful somebody planned something for me.‚Äù ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-10,"AITA for telling my wife I didn‚Äôt enjoy the birthday surprise she planned for me?

187,1dccnrv,AITA for not apologizing to my sister as a way of making a statement to her and the rest of the family.,"It all started the third week of November 2023 when I (33 y.o. M) didn't respond to my sister's (40 y.o. we'll call her Valerie) text where she asked me if I wanted to come over a to eat some pizza and hang out with her and my nephew. I'm known as not being the best texter and it's one of those things where they will jokingly roll their eyes at me if the topic of my unresponsiveness ever comes up, for added context, as I'm writing this, I have 135 unread text messages.

Back to the story, honestly I saw the text at a glance and simply forgot to respond. About a week later, Valerie came over to my mom's house where the family was hanging out a couple days post-Thanksgiving. When she arrived I went over and leaned in to give her a kiss on the cheek to which she abruptly pulled away. It was clear at this point she was mad at me for not responding to her text which I had only just remembered about at that precise moment and it was even more clear at the end of the night when she said goodbye to everyone except me. The damage was done, while I know I should have apologized for not responding, I didn't think it was that big of a deal since I do it so often and knowing my sister, the apology would have fallen on deaf ears. She was officially punishing me by giving me her infamous silent treatment that our family is all too familiar with.

Fast forward about a month later and my other sister (43 y.o. we'll call her Monica and yes I'm the baby of the family) Tells me that that Valerie told her, that it wasn't until after I didn't respond to her text and then saw me online on instagram that she got mad at me claiming that I had time to scroll, but didn't have time to respond to her text message.

Fast forward again to present day (June 2024) and we're still not talking. I've spoken to my dad, mom and Monica and they've all asked me why I can't just reach out to her. I explained to them that there have been multiple occasions (as they all know) where Valerie's gone out of her way to give people the silent treatment and only forgive them when we are practically begging for forgiveness. My family has always tip-toed around her to spare her feelings and in this moment, I felt like what I needed to do was make my point by not apologizing and letting her think this was okay over something so petty. She lost a leg to stand on when she decided that giving me the silent treatment for so long would prove her point instead of communicating in a healthier manner. The longer this has gone on, the more my family agrees that she's in the wrong. What ever point she was trying to make has been overshadowed by her behavior.

188,1dccnni,AITA for flaking on a trip 3 days before we‚Äôre supposed to leave? ,"TLDR: I (25F) flaked on a 4-day beach trip with friends 3 days before we were supposed to leave. I found out I was pregnant. I'm still paying for my share of all expense.

My friends and I have been planning a beach trip since last month and we were all so psyched about it. I even filed my work leaves already. However I missed my period, took a test, and found out I was pregnant.

I could still have gone but I'm stressing out and I feel horrible and I'm going to need to start being financially responsible. I chose to cancel and just pay for my share of the BnB, gas, etc. because it would still be cheaper than going on the trip. 

My friends have been giving me shit about it, about how they understand
my situation but don't understand why I won't go. I've apologized multiple times but I also don't understand the way they think. I'm sick, stressed, about to get into a life-long commitment, but I have to be on the receiving end of all the anger and the passive aggression because I chose to save some money. One of them even said it could greatly impact our friendship..? 

I know it sounds like I'm ranting but I really just don't understand. Am I the asshole? Maybe I need a bunch of redditors' angry comments to see the light. Thanks in advance. Hope you're all having a good Monday

190,1dccias,AITA not wanting my step sister to sleep in my bed while im gone?,"I (age 14, female) have my own room while everyone else in our house has to share. Now, I didn't always have my own room, in fact last month, I was sharing my room downstared with my step-sister (15). My half siblings, my sister(5) and my brother (7) are currently sharing a room. Before, my sister was sharing a room with my other step-sister (age 11, fem) and my brother had my current room all to himself. My mother's boyfriend had moved in to our house in February of this year.

My mother's boyfriend's kids only come on the weekend, so I dont really see them since I go to my fathers occasionally on the weekend.The only problem with me sharing my room with my step sister was that she would never be quiet. If I had my headphones on, she would still talk to me, if I didnt respond, she would still talk to me. As an introvert/ambivert with undiagnosed autism and ADHD, I was easily overwhelmed from her constantly talking. Even if I was in my bed on my phone with the light off and my headphones on, she would talk to me. I didnt want to tell her to be quiet because I would feel guilty because it felt rude to me. So you can see why I would want my own room, right? The thing is, she never treated my like a sister, but more like a friend. And while that was all fine and dandy, she would complain to me and vent multiple times, without even asking. She would vent to me when I wasnt in the best mental space, and while I never told her, I felt like I couldnt. I eventually had enough. I needed my own room, so I asked my mother and she talked to her boyfriend about it. He said yes.

I frequently ask for them to come over throughout the year for get togethers. They live nearby. The problem is my husband has to do the same yearly events every single year. I want to leave time open for me to fill in with events or maybe just stay home and relax. Also he has to bring his grown kids to yearly events. So I'm doing mostly what he wants to do, when and how often he wants to do it, and with his kids alot. I'm not as young as I use to be, things get tiring sometimes, some of his events are hard on me due to some limitations  .I've been caring for sick parents, losing time for myself dealing with other people's needs, and I lose available time for fun because of off and on health issues, that aren't serious just physically limiting sometimes. I'm overwhelmed for sure and tried to discuss with him but he feels I'm compromising his happiness. Yikes, now he wants to plan a special night at our house with his friends, his kids and their friends every 3 or so weeks. He's unhappy that I said not now but all this seems to be more about his needs and I struggle to be accommodated.  AITA?",0.0,-0.003024707781150937,0,1

195,1dcc4eo,AITA for wanting my sister out of my house?,"My sister (29F) moved in with me (25F) and my room mate after having her second baby in June of 2022. This was not supposed to be a permanent arrangement as she is still residing in my house. This was discussed pre-moving in and she knew that this was not supposed to be this long of a stay. She has lived in my living and dining room for this time. This is where the problems have started:

She has no respect for me or my house. She has let her kids destroy my house and leaves it a mess 95/100% of the time. She most of the time just lays on my couch and lets her children roam around and do whatever. And they do literally whatever. I have pictures on pictures of this mess. She was only paying $50 in rent, and we have split the water and electric into thirds. I‚Äôve now started making her pay for wifi and trash. 

I have talked to her nicely before about this and her needing to clean up (because this is not her house no matter how long she stays here). It has gotten to a point where I can‚Äôt be around her and I cuss her out just about every conversation we have. (It is a mutual cussing in conversation, I am not always the first initiate.) She has always been abusive towards me in our childhood, but I‚Äôve always overlooked it, but I think those feelings are having a lot to do with how I feel right now too. I have through the years told her she was fucked up for treating me so bad growing up so it‚Äôs not like she isn‚Äôt aware of how I feel. 

I am now pregnant and having some issues with my blood pressure and I honestly can‚Äôt deal with this issue any longer because I fear my baby and my life are at risk because of how stressed I stay with my current medical issues. It is very overwhelming and it‚Äôs getting to a point where I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.

Before anyone says it, I am obviously aware that clearly we have issues we need to talk about if we ever want a relationship again. There are only so many times you can practically beg for someone to treat you right before you are just done. That is with any kind of relationship. I am just done now.

197,1dcc18t,WIBTA for refusing to help out an elderly neighbor on weekdays?,"I moved into my boyfriend‚Äôs house last year. We live next door to an older couple. The wife asked us to help with small stuff around their house and of course it was no problem for us to help.

My boyfriend initially offered to help drive them to appointments, but he goes into the office 3 days a week and will not change his schedule. He is a creature of habit. I mostly WFH, so I have more flexibility with my hours, so I have been helping with driving them about 95% of the time. So if they have a doctors appointment, I‚Äôll get up the same time as my boyfriend, but then because I start work later, I‚Äôll work until much later in the evening. I think I am resentful of my boyfriend here because he gets home around 6pm and plays video games, watches tv, and can relax. Meanwhile I finish work around 9-10pm these days, then I have to scurry to make us dinner, care for our animals, and do chores before I can go to bed.

The time commitment and unpredictability of when they need me is making it hard for me to plan my work meetings and also my personal time. For example, they might say they need me from 10am-noon on Thursday, but then Thursday comes and at 9:50am they‚Äôll say actually they forgot to tell me they don‚Äôt need me until 3pm. So then I last minute have to rearrange my whole day. Or they might estimate they need me for 2 hours, but in reality it‚Äôs more like 4-5 hours. I understand life and appointments are not predictable but this is happening quite often that their plans change last minute.

I also feel bad when I help them because the wife always makes what I perceive to be rude/unnecessary comments to me. For example, a little comment when she sees me at their door instead of my boyfriend, who she is always saying she wishes was there instead. Or she will make comments about how my boyfriend is such a hard worker and he‚Äôs so great for working hard to put a roof over my head (but little does she know that my earnings are 6x that of my boyfriend‚Äôs, I work twice as many hours as him, and without me he wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford his mortgage). It seems obvious to me based off our jobs so I sometimes feel it comes from sexism on her part.

She has made comments before about how she sees him doing yard work but I should be the one to do that stuff if he is the one letting me live in *his* house (again, I pay the bulk of mortgage and bills).

She says I stress her out on errands and rush her through the store when she wants to take a break and do a sit down lunch. I can‚Äôt do stuff like this because I usually am on a time crunch and don‚Äôt want to be late for a work meeting during the weekdays.

he brought bud (weed) over (which is fine imo) and later said he had 2 lines of MDMA. long story short, he got 2 different dealers to drop bud off to the house- in australia its a schedule 1 drug. which shouldve been a red flag. they were talking about getting coke, when they got the bud i thought they werent getting it. then the coke guy came and they got an 8ball (i think). its about 4am atp. 

my mum doesnt do drugs. she wont even have a bong. but she did coke. about 4/5 lines. the others probably did more. she started offering it to me (she offered 3 times, which i denied). they also were talking about taking the kids to netball which set off red flags for me. i message my older sister and sent a photo, she immediately called me and was pissed.

my grandparents think that coke and weed are on the same level. my sister has medical weed for pain and doesnt understand the difference between a schedule one and schedule 3 drug.

203,1dcbbl5,AITA for make coffee and drink it by myself?,"My family loves coffee and we make it every morning, from there we all (my mom, my two siblings and I) drink without problems, even leaving for a couple more cups. Usually I or my mom does it.

Now, yesterday I made coffee in the afternoon because no one made coffee in the morning, while my whole family was out and there was only me. I drank my cup of coffee at that moment and left the rest there for them to drink when they arrived. In fact, I let them know that there was coffee and that they could drink it whenever they wanted.

The problem is that no one drank and in the early morning when I went to the kitchen (I was working on something that kept me awake until that time) the coffee was just as I left it in the afternoon. So (like the coffee addict that I am) I drank it all myself, so as not to leave anything out and be able to make more coffee today.

This morning my mom scolded me for making coffee at that time because I knew they were going to be late and (according to her) I knew that no one was going to drink coffee at that time. I reminded her that I told them they could have coffee and it wasn't until dawn, when everyone was asleep, that I took it. She insisted that I was wrong to make so much coffee and that next time do it just for me.

At first I was adamant that I didn't do anything wrong and she was the one who got angry for nothing, but now I'm not sure anymore. Maybe my mom is right and I should have made coffee for myself, since it is true that I know that she (my brothers have no problems with that) does not drink coffee at night. So am I the aashole?

Also, sorry if anything is misspelled, English is not my first language.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-10,"AITA for make coffee and drink it by myself?

204,1dcbbdp,AITA for telling my friend that her daughter would have a better life if she gave up her vices?,"I, 25F have been friends with ‚ÄúEmily,‚Äù 25F, since middle school. I want to preface a couple of things: Emily and I had similar upbringings. We grew up on the poverty line, using food banks and being close to being evicted as children. I am also childfree by choice, as I am self aware enough to know that I am too selfish of a person now to have children. I had nothing as a kid, I want all my things now. Emily, also a relatively selfish person, is not so self-aware, and does not like to sacrifice her joys in life for anyone. Unfortunately, this also includes her 6-year-old daughter, ‚ÄúEmma.‚Äù

Emily has many vices that she enjoys - shopping, some alcohol, fast food, and, most of all, cigarettes and marijuana. Money is tight for everyone, but she ensures she always has what she needs‚Ä¶ especially the last two. 

In the past few months, Emma has asked for several things and the answer has always been no. The biggest one being a bike for her birthday, and then more recently, swim lessons, as it‚Äôs June and her friends all go to the rec center to swim. Yesterday, while running errands, we were in a store and Emma asked again if she could have swim lessons because she wanted to be able to go to the pool with her friends over summer break from school. Emily once again told her that they were too expensive and that they couldn‚Äôt afford them, and Emma started to cry. Emily apologized to her, and explained that money was tight‚Ä¶ before turning around to pay for her two cartons of cigarettes. 

When we got back to their place, Emma, who was still upset, went to the couch and put on a movie. I pulled Emily into her bedroom and took the opportunity to explain that I believe it‚Äôs important to Emma to take those lessons. Emily repeated that she didn‚Äôt have the money and I said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the money for her, but you have the money to smoke?‚Äù Emily immediately became defensive and called me an asshole who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to be a single mom.‚Äù I agreed, but reminded her that we both know what it‚Äôs like to miss out on things in childhood, and it felt like Emma was going to suffer the same fate. Emily basically told me to leave if I was going to accuse her of being a bad parent, before leaving her bedroom and storming outside to have a cigarette. I ended up leaving after saying goodbye to Emma, and now Emily is refusing to speak to me. 

I am just worried that this kid is going to be on the outside looking in because her mom isn‚Äôt prioritizing her, but I know I could have worded things better. AITA?
