0,1dddcvq,AITA for not calling my brothers spouse bhabee,So for context bhabee (I'm not sure of the actual spelling) means sister in law in Hindi. I have three brothers. Two who are older and married and one is younger than me. My oldest brother is married to woman who I call bhabee. My second oldest brother recently got married to his partner of two years. They're nonbinary but a biological woman. I have never called them bhabee because I didn't know if it was disrespectful or not I usually refer to them by their name or I call them doll or something. Yesterday we were all at my parents house for dinner. I was setting the table with my eldest sister in law and I was talking to her about this boy I've been seeing and I assume I was saying bhabee a lot. My brothers spouse asked me what bhabee means and I told them it meant sister in law. They asked me why I don't call them bhabee and I explained my reasoning. They started saying that's bs and saying that I was rude and disrespectful. I really wasn't trying to be. My brother and his spouse left and my brother texted me and told me I was rude to his spouse and accused me of not treating them like family. He said he wouldnt speak to me until I apologize to his spouse. My eldest brother and his wife are on my side but my parents just want to keep the peace and told me I should apologize.

I try to look, but I try more to focus on traffic, especially if I'm changing lanes. On this day, she wanted to show me something and I didn't pay attention to see it because I was changing lanes, which made her say 'Wow, you didn't look at what i show you' angrily, which made me angry and I said, 'Can't you fucking see I'm focusing on driving?', which caused a fight.

On another more recent occasion, I was cooking a stir-fry, and she wanted to show me something on her phone. I managed to look at the first one, but when I had to constantly stir the food, I couldn't look at the second thing she showed me.

2,1dd2w6b,"AITA for giving my nephew an ""extravagant"" birthday gift?","My brother (M47) and his wife (F45) have one son, Ryan (M17). I (M36) am unmarried without children, and Ryan is my parents' only grandchild. My brother and his wife are both public schoolteachers and do alright for themselves but are by no means wealthy. I'm an attorney and am well off but certainty not rich. 

Ryan and I have always been close. I used to have a job that required a great deal of travel, and I've taken him to Japan, Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and many countries in Europe. His parents approved of this as a way to help him expand his horizons and have never objected to me spending money on him before. However, last week he turned 17. For the last decade or so, I've worn a medallion featuring an Ancient Greek coin with the image of Poseidon. Ryan has always thought this was a cool piece - so for his 17th birthday, I gave him a medallion with a coin featuring the image of the god Apollo. For those who haven't brushed up on their ancient mythology, Apollo is the son of Zeus and the nephew of Poseidon. I thought the necklace was a great way to commemorate our relationship - it cost about $1,200. 

But my brother didn't like the gift at all. He told me the necklace was ""extravagant"" and accused me of trying to ""show up"" him and his wife. I pointed out that Ryan got a new set of golf clubs for this 16th birthday and would be getting a car for 18th birthday. Therefore, this necklace wouldn't compete with the other ""big gifts"" he received and would be receiving from his parents. I also reminded my brother that between airfare and hotels, I've spent more than $1,200 on Ryan during some of the trips on which I've taken him. But my brother didn't listen and told me to take the necklace back, saying I didn't need to ""rub \[my\] money in \[his\] face."" I refused, saying that Ryan is old enough to appreciate such things.

I don't think I did anything wrong, but AITA?

3,1dd2oub,AITA for planning to take one sibling out but not the other ,"Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my main 

I (19F) am autistic, I have fairly low support needs however I do require someone to be with me when I go out as I get easily overwhelmed and it's safer for someone to be with me if something were to happen.

One of my special interests is the circus, specifically the one in my town and as I have my own money I've decided that when I get paid at the end of the month I want to book to go, I looked at the ticket prices today and discovered that they offer a carers ticket and the minimum age requirement for that is fourteen meaning that I'd only have to pay for MY ticket rather than paying £19.50 each for myself and my brother (14M) 

My younger sister (13F) overheard me discussing the plans with 14 and she asked if she could join us, I explained to her that as his ticket would be free then I'd only be taking him, i then told her that if she wants ill take her on her own day out either before or after, maybe to the cinema as there's a film she wants to see, she said that I rarely take her out and that it's always him that I take out (she was mostly referencing to when I took him to the amusement park for my birthday but didn't take her as she isn't a  fan of rides) which I do understand but I do also take her out, last month i literally gave her £50 for her birthday, took her shopping, to the arcade and then bought her dinner when we got home.

She is still mad at me and has told our older sister (22F) who is telling me that I'm harsh for not just paying for her ticket as hers would only be about £13 because the kids ticket is obviously cheaper and while yes i can afford the ticket another reason for me taking 14 is the bonus of it being cheaper (+ me needing someone with me for support) 

I genuinely don't know how I am TA considering i have told 13 that I will happily take her out to the movies whenever she wants me to which realistically works out more expensive considering I'd be paying for both our tickets plus popcorn and a slushie for her like i usually do when I take her to the movies.

4,1dd2kzv,AITA for writing a tweet ,"So… bear with me, the story is longer
Me and my best friend from elementary school were close up until a couple of months ago. We always had a pact that he would be my each others MOH/BM
When I got together with my now husband 12 ya, he was immediately informed that my best friend is a guy, he’s one of the ppl I trust most in my life, and he is part of my family (I’ll call him Joe)
When hubbs saw our dynamic he immediately understood our relationship and always treated Joe like a brother.

Fast forward 18 Months ago
Joes daughter was born, everybody including me is excited, he calls me to tell me they are having a christening ceremony and we would be the godparents 
I am excited, buying gifts for my little goddaughter doing everything I can to help.
I noticed our communication drifting, naturally it comes and goes.
Her first birthday came, I know my SIL is pretty particular I just gift card for her bday.
We called them in the evening so my son can sing to her happy birthday, made some small talk and I didn’t hear from him for 4 Months (my son’s birthday) - they congratulated sang, again a little chit chat over and out.
Again months go by without even a text, and I am getting pretty upset at this point.
My mother had surgery, I’ve lost my job I had a pretty hard couple of months.
I tried to write but didn’t hear back.
I asked him what’s wrong 
It turns out - he read a tweet that I wrote about idiots being idiots, and he thought it was about him, and was upset with me because of it. He proceeded to tell my that he only invited me as a godmother to his child only so that we would not drift apart. He said “ You found someone that tolerates you, and you look happy, but I can not teach a grown woman how to behave” 
When I asked how I was selfish he told me that when we called so my son could sing happy birthday, afterwards I started chatting about random happenings from our lives, and taking the shine away from his daughter, and I’ve only sent a gift card instead of sending something material for her.
Another example of my selfishness is that when he called for my son’s birthday I again started talking about the adults afterwards. He proceeded to tell me how I didn’t send them an anniversary gift, or at least a card. His wife was noticing that and she was offended. She is from the south and they were really paying attention to send cards and stuff for everything [even though we haven’t received a txt msg for our anniversary]

He didn’t know a thing that was happening in the last months, but here I was labeled the queen of selfishness, and when I told him what’s up he said we should follow up the next day. That was 4 Months ago. I honestly don’t plan on contacting him, I drifted apart with a chunk of that friend group since it was pretty toxic, but I really thought he was a lifer.
I guess I am the AHole for not having boundaries idk

There are a few people that work there that are not gentle to those who are first learning and my girlfriend is not gentle to those who are can come across as bossy or a little mean. So, I’m afraid drama might come of it, people will know she is my gf because we share the same address one co worker already knows what my girlfriend’s name is and what she looks like. So everyone is going to know. (Also we are both lesbians and there are a lot of co workers who are homophobic. Most don’t know about me, only one.. maybe two. I’m pretty secretive about my private life at work). I’m afraid that in the end, it will make me look bad and will affect my position at the job. I know I shouldn’t say this, but I don’t want to end up getting embarrassed or caught in the mix.

7,1dd2gpi,WIBTA For telling my roommate his girlfriend can't stay?,"I'll start by introducing the characters. Me(20F) and my bf (24M, We'll call him Kevin) have lived together for 2 years and some change since we got together. We moved into a 2BR house, and stayed there for about a year before a friend of Kevin's that we'd been hanging out with for an amount of time asked if he could stay with us until he got back on his feet.  
  
I had my reservations considering he had a pattern of being irresponsible. For instance-- the reason he was even out of a place in the first place is because he broke his lease to go follow a girl he'd just started talking to to another state he had no family or support system in. This was after the girl had already abandoned him in our state with no calls or texts to let him know she'd moved away.

We had initially planned to stay together with him on our couch until our lease was up, and then go our separate ways. Long story short, we decided it would be better financially to move together into a bigger place with him as a roommate. Before we moved, we agreed that we would have no more roommates until we parted ways.

This brings me to my current situation. Roomate (21M, I'll call him Roger) has brought a new visitor into the house very frequently and it's been bothering us. It's not the fact that he has company-- we don't care about visitors on weekends, and that goes for everyone in the house. Nobody has company on a weekday, if at all. And if they are, they are only there for a couple hours.

Not only is his new friend (21F, calling her Stacy) a complete stranger to us, she's pregnant (not by him) and me and the boyfriend are adamantly childfree at the moment. Roger knew her and dated her for one day in high school before deciding she was the one 5 years later (with no prior contact). Her car is always in the way when she comes over (we have a tiny driveway barely large enough for our 2 cars) and as soon as she started coming over, she leaves her stuff around the house as if she's moved in.

Stacy herself is not the problem. She's actually not a bad person, it's just the frequency in which she visits when we placed boundaries with visitors before we even moved in together that has really put a strain on daily activities and house dynamics. Roger insists on bringing her over every day, and even has a baby crib in his room despite being told we don't want another roommate, much less a stranger's baby in the house.

Stacy also technically doesn't have a place to stay (or so I've been told). Roger refuses to go visit her because he doesn't like her roommates. This is where I'm thinking I might be an asshole-- Sure, it's annoying suddenly-- and I mean SUDDENLY-- having a random (to us) pregnant woman damn near move into our house with no discussion beforehand whatsoever, but do we really want to kick a (possibly) homeless pregnant woman to the curb?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-11,"WIBTA For telling my roommate his girlfriend can't stay?

8,1dd2dd3,AITA for Distrusting My Boyfriend’s Travel Plans After His Poor Budgeting Left Us in Debt Last Time?,"I (F, 26) and my boyfriend (M, 25) switched to remote jobs at the same company three years ago. Around that time, he proposed we use our newfound freedom to travel the world since we had no local responsibilities. He was incredibly passionate about it and planned everything, so I followed his lead. For six months, we had amazing experiences.

For context, even though he’s a year younger, he had been living independently for six years while I was still with my family. This trip was my first time so far from home, and I had experiences I never would have had without his initiative. However, the joy didn't last long because we returned home about 1600€ in debt each. He had assured me our salaries would roughly cover the trip, but we ended up short every month, and his spontaneous booking of our return flight added several hundred euros to the cost. It took months to repay the debt, and since then, my trust in his travel planning has been shattered.

I was shocked when he said, “In a few years, we won't think about the money anymore, but the experiences will stay with us forever.” He has a different background, having looked after himself since he was 16 and experienced bigger financial lows and highs. For me, it was my first job, and being in debt for the first time really affected me mentally and scared me a lot.

Since then, I've rejected all his suggestions for longer trips or traveling outside Europe. Today, he approached me again, explaining he now understands how much debt affects me and has a new one-month trip outside Europe in mind. He claimed he would ensure this trip stayed within our budget and emphasized that he wanted me to focus on our fond memories rather than the debt. He listened to my concerns and even reviewed our past finances to find ways to save money this time. He admitted his mistake with the spontaneous return flight booking and promised to book both flights together this time.

Despite his efforts, I didn't want to approve the trip because I’m still disappointed by his previous recklessness. He also seemed to expect gratitude for planning everything during the first trip, which he never received because I was too angry about the aftermath. He appeared very disappointed by my rejection and lack of thanks. He reminded me we were both young and that he had learned a lot about travel planning and my needs, acknowledging how important financial stability is to me compared to him.

His attitude made me angry, and I told him, “I wasn’t just young, I was also stupid. Stupid to blindly trust you.” This hurt him deeply, and he was speechless for a while.

I believe my concerns are valid, as his prioritization of adventure over stable finances still worries me.

9,1dd2cj1,AITA for flipping out on my flatmate-landlord?,"My (F21) flatmate (M34) is also my landlord and we have been living together for 2.5 months.

Recently I have flipped out on him after starting to resent him quickly after probably bottling all my discontent towards certain things. Since he is my landlord, I feel like we don't live on the same terms and he is in more power to set the rules. I also have mixed depression and anxiety disorder which my flatmate is aware of, including how it makes me feel over anxious about a lot of things.

Some things that have led me to flip out:
- he threw out my expired slice of bread ""for my own good"" that I still intended to eat (thus, I took it out of the trash can, he knows I ""trash hunt"" and don't care if something is expired) and my flat box that takes literally 0 space in the storage room, where I don't have any other stuff and there is still some space.
- he leaves his dirty pissed underwear in his laundry basket in the bathroom in plain sight.
- he leaves shit stains in the toilet.
- he makes jokes that he will burst into my room after I told him how I was angry with my previous flatmate who broke into my room after midnight when I was sleeping and was naked.
- he was calling someone today and was cleaning very loudly at 3 AM and didn't understand why I asked him to stop since I couldn't sleep.
- he doesn't understand that I am a girl living with a grown up man and any unnecessary act from his side can make me uncomfortable and I will be ""trapped"" in my own home. He makes fun of me not liking excessive touching after I told him I don't find it funny. He got upset when I told him I have preferred dancing with a ""MILF"" who volunteered to help me with Latin American dancing and I have found it rather arousing, but not dancing with him. He called my gym outfit ""sexy"", which I find to be unnecessary information, and so on. He has recently broken up with his girlfriend, I agreed to live with him since I knew he had a gf and I stated that I had a bf which made me consider him less creepy. It is also very hard to find a decent accomodation in my area so everyone is kind of desperate.

I think I may be an asshole and here may have been a lack of miscommunication from my side and I needed to tell him about my discontent and discomfort about some of his actions right away instead of bottling it up in me since he couldn't have guessed about my feelings.

10,1dd28op,AITA for letting my dad stay with me for an internship?,"For context, I’m a second year college engineering student who received an out of state offer for an internship for this summer. 

At first I was excited about going to the new state, but my dad then said I’m going to be coming with you after talking to my mom. 

Initially, I was upset because I wanted to be fully independent. My dads been working remotely and helping me out with dinner as he said he would so far. But other than that he’s just going to be there. He also helped me drive to this new state as I need a car for this job.

I’m a pretty family oriented person but the problem comes in with my girlfriend. My girlfriend first freaked out when she first heard that my dad will be staying with me during the internship and she asked me to tell my parents “no I want to be independent”. Having Asian parents, I asked but got shut down immediately with them asking what’s wrong if he comes, and “you already stay out of state for college anyways so you can’t expect to stay all alone again”. I genuinely did not have a response nor did I know what to tell my girlfriend. I 100% see their response as possessive but inside I didn’t really know what’s “absolutely insane” about my dad coming over. he’s just going to help me out when he can, other than that he’s basically my roommate. 

She doesn’t have a similar family oriented lifestyle, and usually gets mad at me whenever my parents do something toxic which is understandable, but does that change anything.
Even her mom thinks I’m being “spoonfed” and a “p*ssy”, which is the same things she’s telling me.

It’s been a week into the internship, and my girlfriend still brings up that this is “insane” and told her friends that my dad joining me for this internship out of state, and they also seemed to think it was insane. She calls me a child and less manly repeatedly and idk how to respond. Am I off for thinking this is somewhat normal and doesn’t compromise me being independent for the rest of my life? I genuinely love her to death but idk what to do. She thinks I’m justifying me staying with my dad when I tried telling her that for me, it’s not that big of a deal it’s bc I just grew up that way. But she keeps saying I have the wrong judgement and she’s rethinking her decisions about the relationship based off of my judgement for this situation. She’s said she’s not going to talk to me until the internship ends, and just said “you’re right, enjoy”

Am I the asshole, any advice on what I should say or how I should feel? I really don’t know myself and I can’t stop thinking about it.

11,1dd2215,"AITA for yelling and threatening divorce on my wife after she ditched me, even though we agreed to be partners in an activity together?","I (21f) got angry at my wife (20f) for ditching me with another friend in an extra-curricular orienteering course when we agreed that we would partner together. 

 

Let's call my wife Janessa. Basically, this other girl I'll name Margaret usually hangs out with me and takes me away from my wife. She only takes me and doesn't try to hang out with anyone else. Honestly, it's been annoying, especially since it's obvious she only wants to hang out with me and not my other friends. 

My wife was mad that I kept on ditching her for Margaret- which I didn't want to do; I have a hard time saying no. I told her that I can say no, it's just that Janessa has to back me up and say that I'm team mates with her so I don't look stupid by saying no, making it appear like my wife doesn't love me. She agreed with this, and I thought that we would be fine, but APPARENTLY NOT! 

The next day we went to our course. Margaret came over, asked, and I politely declined. She asked repeatedly, so I looked up to my wife who was talking with Shane and asked her to back me up but instead she walked off. I understand she didn’t hear me, but later when I was standing with Margaret, Janessa was sitting on a bench staring at me. When I went with Margaret, I remember being sad because if she’s not trying to stop me then she doesn’t care that I go with her.  

After an hour of orienteering, I came back to where we were all stationed. I planned on having a civil talk with my wife at home but before leaving, Shane walks up to me and says, “your wifes been complaining about you.” Then pointed towards my wife who was angry. 

I was confused- I believe I did nothing wrong. She started yelling at me in front of everyone. I told her to stop yelling because here wasn’t the time yet she continued. Luckily people were ignoring us so I started yelling back. She said I was the one who left, breaking the promise. I was mad because I was standing there and SHE walked off. She said she didn’t hear me and Im at fault for talking to Margaret in the first place. How am I supposed to tell her no without talking to her? She said it was my fault for not talking loud enough and that if I truly loved her then I would’ve yelled louder. I apologized for not yelling loud enough but said that I wasn’t acting wrong. She continued yelling so I had enough; I threatened divorce. I agree this is uncalled for but for context: when we argue she ALWAYS threatens divorce and claims that she’s right. She always brags about how she’s right and I can’t disagree with her or she’ll start yelling at me.  

Currently we are on break and she is with her parents. We have the same hobbies so we can’t exactly stay away from each other. Shane is great and is kind of a peace maker. We can hang out in our friend group but don’t talk with each other, if we do it’s mostly mean comments. I do admit that I am rude with her when we talk because I seriously can’t with her right now. I believe I’m right but she’s making me think I’m the asshole.

12,1dd1qkm,WIBTAH if I don’t attend my childhood friends wedding?,"Throwaway since my friends know my main. This year three of my childhood friends have/are getting married. I’m extremely excited for them. For backstory, I (30F) have grown up with this group since 3rd grade and we became very close in middle and high school. During college I drifted apart, but reconnected in my mid-20s. We talk in a group chat almost daily, however I’ve only really connected on a one-on-one level with one friend, we’ll call her Emily. 

In October, Emily got married to our other friend Sam and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was overjoyed and took off two weeks of work to attend the out of town bachelor/bachelorette weekend, wedding activities and wedding itself. The wedding was held in our childhood town so I was able to drive there and have another friend watch my dog during that time. Still the trips and excursions were expensive and I had just started a new job and moved to a new state in June.

Now my other friend, we’ll call him Josh is getting married in August across the country (I live on the East Coast of the US). Then another friend, Kevin, is getting married 10 hours away from me in October. As much as I want to attend both, I’m looking at spending around $1.3K - $1.5K for Josh’s wedding and around $750-$900 for Kevin’s. Not including the cost of boarding my dog.

I’ve been saving for both, I started to work at a food delivery service to help, even though I work 40-50hrs a week at a high level job. 

I just found out that Josh has scheduled a bachelor/bachelorette weekend with the entire group this month, except me. He’s invited his other friends as well so it’s not just our group. He messaged me to let me know because he didn’t want me to be upset if I saw the pictures online. I know he doesn’t mean any malice, but it does hurt. I’m not sure I want to spend such a large amount of money to attend this wedding, but I know it will damage my relationship with the entire group.

I feel selfish since I’m not sure I would’ve been able to afford or take off for Josh’s bachelor/bachelorette trip anyway, but it hurts to be excluded then expected to make such an investment for the wedding. Also, to be clear not everyone invited on the trip is in the wedding party.

Also, Kevin invited me to his bachelor/bachelorette weekend in July which I can drive to, is a group cabin and I already have accommodations for my dog. So it wasn’t too expensive. I’m also not in Kevin’s wedding party.

I think I’ll look like an asshole if I attend Kevin’s wedding and not Josh’s. I just don’t know if I can afford both. I also feel unwanted since Josh did not include me in their weekend. He did include Emily, so it’s not a gender issue.

Would I be the asshole if I don’t attend Josh’s wedding and attend Kevin’s?

13,1dd1n38,AITA for not letting extended family stay at my house?,"AITA for refusing to allow extended family stay with me because I felt I was unfairly treated by them in the past? 

I am close with my family and we often vacationed/visited extended family together even as grown adults.  Of 5 siblings, me and my younger sister were both married. Each time we traveled to visit family out of town, my sister and her husband would be provided with a bedroom, while my husband and I were given common areas to sleep.

This wasn’t due to seniority of age or relationship length. I was married one year prior to my sister as well as was in a relationship with my husband for several years longer than she was with her husband. 

This happened approximately 10 times, not all with the same family but with various vacations. Fast forward to today, the extended family that put me in a common room every time I visited is coming in to town and needs a place to stay. I said since my younger sister was always so kindly accommodated by this family member, she should return the favor and let the extended family stay with her. 

All my sisters are saying I’m being an asshole to not make a sacrifice to host, and insane to care where I slept and that my little sister wasn’t given special treatment and I need to get over it. The only reason I’ve ever been given (beyond “I don’t remember”) is that no one liked my sisters husband and they wanted him to stay in a room where they didn’t have to hangout with him. 

To clarify, my younger sister now has five kids and all my siblings think it would be “easier on everyone” if I let the extended family stay at my house and in my bedroom and I just couch surf at my sisters while the extended family was in town. 

I am admittedly against this because I resent this family member for how she treated me like I was less important or deserving of privacy and also I don’t want to give up my house for 2 weeks especially because I work remote 2 days a week. But mostly it’s about the past if I’m being honest. AITA?

14,1dd1kte,AITA for not trying to get into contact with my brothers baby momma for a 2nd time,I 28F have a twin brother. He has 2 baby mommas but I am not close to neither one of them. I have had contact with the 1st baby momma on and off for the last couple of years. They have 1 son who is about to be 5 in about a week. My brother went to jail at the end of January. This isn’t his 1st time but it will be his longest. Now I normally see my nephew through my brother because he lives with me but with him in jail I would have to get ahold of her instead. I didn’t think this would be a problem considering this wouldn’t be the 1st time me and her have had to interact with each other because my brother wasn’t around to be the middle man. I have had her number saved in my phone since they were in a relationship but I didn’t have to message her till October 2022 to let her know that my brother was in jail and that I would be watching my nephew in his stead. We had to keep communicating to set up drop off and pick up times and location. We didn’t have any issues. Now my brother decided to go back to jail at a bad time. I had just gotten a new job so I was working crazy hours and didn’t really have that much time. I did contact her to let her know about my brothers situation. Now I can say that my job took up so much of my time that I didn’t have time to watch my nephew. B4 anyone comes for me she didn’t try to contact me either and she could have. My schedule kinda opened up about a month in a half after my brother went to jail. I tried contacting his 1st baby momma to check up on them and to see if there was any days that she needed me to take my nephew. When I messaged her I didn’t announce who I was because I didn’t think I needed to. Now after the few interactions we’ve had I thought she would at least have my number saved in her phone or our chat history saved so when I messaged her she would no who I was but instead her response was “I’m sorry Idk who this is.

I just got the invitation this afternoon for the event tomrrow afternoon.

A lot of people have signed up to bring food already. The only thing I could sign up for is a salad or chips/salsa.

Would I be the asshole if I go to the team potluck/gathering without bringing any food since I received the invitation so late?

For some more info which may or may not matter, I'm planning to quit this job early next month. The salary isn't high. I've secured a new role more aligned to my interests in a new city and with a much higher salary and benefits.

17,1ddsnud,AITA For Kicking My Jobless Ex Out of My House?,"For context before the story starts, me (19M) and my ex girlfriend, Breckie (fake name) (19F) lived with my parents during her summer vacation from school. She doesn't work and I do. I work a full time job and work more than 50 hours a week. I get 2 days off a week but more often then not i end up working a half day on one of them because we are understaffed. Every day i get home around 6:30-9 PM. My days off should be a day that I get to rest and relax with my girlfriend, but instead I have to clean all of the messes she has made over the week. Dishes, Laundry, and trash all over the floor. Personally I believe that if one partner is working and the other isn't that the jobless one should be doing household chores.

More Context. We don't have any kids. So it isn't like she is doing anything other than laying in our bed and scrolling on her phone. I've tried to communicate with her about it and she just blew up on me. She called me a ""misogynist"" and told me to go fuck myself. I slept on the couch that night to give her space. Breckie and me were arguing every day for weeks after that. I kept trying to ask her if there was a reason she didn't wanna help with anything around the house that she lives in. Once again I pay for everything. All the food she eats. The plates she eats on. The silverware she eats with. I don't know if I am in the wrong for wanting and borderline expecting the chores to be done. But if I am let me know. 

Trying to be a supportive partner I asked her if she wanted to talk to a therapist because maybe it was a mental health thing. (I suffer from depression myself and often times find lack of motivation to do anything at times.) After I said this she told me she needed a break and went to bed. (She doesn't have anywhere else to go because her relationship with her family is in a really horrible spot. So I wasn't going to just have her leave.) I slept on the couch for a few more weeks giving her space. Then at the beginning of the month, (June 2024 at the time of making this) she asked if the 2 of us could talk. 

I go upstairs to our room and immediately I am in shock. The room is in shambles. My stuff is barely even visible because of all the trash and dishes. I wish I took a picture but I was too disgusted. I lost it right there. Going into my bedroom and seeing all of my things gross and covered with trash. I yelled at her for the first time in our relationship. I told her to be gone by the time I get home from work tomorrow. 

I get home the next day and my house is trashed. All of the dishes (not just mine but my parents' too) are broken. The kitchen floor is covered in broken ceramic bowls and plates and glass. The TV in my room and my the living room were broken. I tried to call her and text her but I was blocked on everything. It makes me wonder if maybe I was wrong for doing that.

18,1ddsns2,AITA for being harsh to my mother after our house burned down?,"My mom, to me, seems to have some type of issue(s) in the head. She rarely takes the blame for any issues, and never takes my word for anything. I'm a good kid, but my mom, however, never trusts a word I say. Whether it be if I closed and locked the back door (she always goes back and checks just in case,) or something even smaller, like the other day when she kept on insisting she had given me this expensive chapstick she had from our house. She didn't believe me, even though I kept on telling her over and over again I never even took it from her to put in my pockets as she insisted. She seemed about ready to go into my room and start looking through my (very little, yet organized) things that had taken me hours to put away nice and neatly.
When she eventually did find her chapstick, she didn't even apologize for blaming me. Now, onto what happened recently with her. I, am not athletic. I did wreslting for one year (I believe I sucked at it) and band for 3, playing tuba for 2, and a few other sports I played for maybe a year before I quit.I've always had issues with them. Thinking on it all, it is mainly because of how much I lay in bed and because of how bad my stamina is. 
But, I've found, from last years school field day (which I've never been allowed to skip), that I run into issues with this. Even if I do eat decently, when I push myself too hard, as everyone has a limit, I start shaking and go pale and feel like I'm going to faint. I know this, and I know how many of my classmates were going to skip. Which is why I wanted to skip this year's field day, since I would have to run atleast twice in the school's relay like races no matter what. I'm incapable of pushing myself that hard, and I knew this. But I still had to. So, the week of field day, a few days beforehand, I tried to convince my mother to skip on a car ride, just us.
I had already asked my mom if I could skip, in the form of a text message, which she never got back to me on (as she does often..). As it turns out, she had asked my step-dad on the matter and whether I should skip or not. My step-dad one saying that irritates me whenever he tries to use it in instances like these. The said saying is that, to him, we have to learn to do things we dislike. I get that, because we do. But its not a matter of disliking the event. Its a matter if me not wanting to have to pretty much crawl my way all the way to the nurses office, feeling like I'm going to completely faint because I'm so exhausted and I'm shaking like a wet dog.
So, when I kept on going back and forth with her, begging her to try and convince him because, again, I didn't want to literally faint in the middle of school or something, I made a remark. I know I shouldn't have, but I was just so tired of it.

22,1ddrooi,AITA or is my mother-in-law crossing the line?,"UPDATE: thank you everyone who replied. He was alert and his usual self so we talked. I shared what happened while he was under and shortly after his surgery. He apologised that his mom manipulated the situation and that he couldn’t step in. He said if he ever had another surgery (hopefully not) we would go straight home after and he would be firm with his mother and the doctor/hospital about what he wanted before going under. I’m going to pick him up this morning. 

AITA for being upset and my mother-in-law, is just being caring for her only son or am I justified in feeling that my mother-in-law is crossing the line? And how should I address this?

My husband (m28) and I (f33) have been married 4.5 years. He had to have minor surgery on his nose.

We discussed that Saturday and Sunday night, after the surgery, we would stay at my mother-in-law‘s because it’s close to the hospital.

However, while my husband was under anaesthesia, my mother-in-law made a big point to say that we had pets and told the doc that four days would be better to stay at her house. The doc agreed it would be better to prevent any pet fur from getting in the wound due to the stents. I stated that the pets wouldn’t be in the room with my husband and that it is very clean. Our pets are all indoors and up to date on their shots. Plus my mother-in-law has a dog.

After the surgery, while I was trying to care for him, his mother would constantly step in and not let me take care of him. For example I went to help him into the car out of the wheelchair and she ran over moved me out of the way and put pillows on his lap, buckled him in, and close the door. Another example: I was walking with him around the room to do a little movement and she called me into the kitchen asking for “her little helper” to do something in the kitchen. Then she proceeded to walk with him around the room. I finished up in the kitchen and came back to her helping him clean out his nose. I tried to help and she told me to go do something else in the kitchen. 

He spent the night at my mother-in-law’s house while I came back home to get a few supplies Sunday night. He wasn’t supposed to be out in the sun so it made sense for him to come home at night Monday. No cats in the our bedroom that evening and I spent Monday cleaning and getting healthy meals ready. 

 On Monday night he told me he could not come home because the doc said that he should stay four days away from pet hair that afternoon. His mom had taken him to the doc again and didn’t tell me. I had even asked his mom how he was on Monday afternoon and she said he was napping. Turns out the wound wasn’t being cleaned well enough and his nose was completely clogged. (Note: my husband can’t really text or talk due to the surgery).

I was upset and worried. Called my husband to tell him our house is always very clean, I would care of him, his mom brought it up to the doctor to stay at her house because of my cats for 4 days when originally the doc said 2 days, and that his mom has a dog too. He said it was just another night and sounded very out of it. 

However I am really upset with this whole situation. I feel like she was using the pets as an excuse for him to stay at her house so she can take care of him, especially because when I try to take care of him she  gives me stuff to do and is taking advantage of him being out of it from medication.

24,1ddrjur,WIBTA If I cut my parents off financially for disrespecting my partner and our relationship,"My partner (P, 30M) and I (30M) work and live overseas to both our parents. We have been together for over 8 years and are married. For the last couple years I have been financially supporting my parents (I send money back to cover all their bills and utilities (internet, gas, water, electricity, home insurance \~ranging between 600-900/month), cover the mortgage (\~650/month) and $250 extra just to help them our with groceries or other discretionary spending. Both my parents are retired so they also receive government pension payments.

This brings me to a recent blowout I had when my Dad sent me an invoice for his car registration as well as a utilities bill and told me to pay it. A day or two after that I called home to chat with my family and during that call I reminded him that I have already paid the utilities bill but I would not be covering the car registration as I reminded him that this wasn't part of what I had agreed to cover. He immediately went into a tirade saying how I'm a bad son and that basically I owed the duty of taking care of them cause they raised me (we are Vietnamese for context here). He said I was only sending him a measly $100 a month (which is infuriating cause apparently everything else doesn't count cause it doesn't directly go into his pocket). I was already getting really upset but I basically said ""I wont be paying the car registration because its already very unfair to my partner and his family, before I consider adding on more support I want to start supporting my partners family as well. So at this stage you'll have to cover that but we can certainly revisit this once my partner and I get raises and increase our income."". At this stage I am annoyed but I think I can let this go and this will roll over after we both have a bit of time to calm down.

Its here that I get most upset and most hurt, he says ""Don't you dare bring your friend into our financial matter, dont you dare bring your friend into our family discussions"". This is where I think my blood began to boil, my partner up to now had been so understanding and so supportive of the financial assistance I provide them (even skewed away from his own family). I tried to remain calm and replied ""You can't say that, P and I live together and my money is his money just as much as his money is my money"". Dad responds ""Don't bring your friend into this, your friend has no say in how we as a family spend our money"". He then adds ""You know what, if spending $500 for my car registration once a year is going to get in the way of your luxury lifestyle then you don't need to support us at all. We will take care of ourselves, I don't need your measly $100 a month"".

At this point my mum realizes thing are getting way too heated so she grabs the phone and says we should talk more later and then hangs up.

25,1ddrfmi,WIBTA for refusing to leave my dog with a stranger for three weeks to go on vacation?,"I (M36) and currently having a disagreement with my wife (F35) about leaving my dog with her uncle while we go on vacation.

This started when my therapist suggested that me sitting home alone all the time (I work from home) wasn't helping me (PTSD and anxiety from being an ER/PSYCH nurse) and that I should get a dog. I've never had a dog before so I figured I'd try it. My first attempt the puppy had a birth defect and died after a month of having it and I was devastated (no one knew about the defect till the puppy had passed away). My wife convinced me to give it one more go and that led to me getting Sadie, my newfoundland puppy.

This dog has been life changing. Better than any antidepressant I've ever had. My blood pressure is down, I lost weight, I don't have nightmares anymore since she wakes me up if I have one. I train her, I walk her twice a day, we go to group classes for dog training once a week, I brush her, I take her out to the park. She's amazing and she's the sweetest animal I've ever seen. I can go out in public with her without feeling like I'm about to be attacked by something. My therapist suggested training her as a service dog since I qualify for one if she was this helpful so I'm doing that but she isn't fully trained yet as she's only a year and a half old.

Well I was going to go on vacation, and my sister was going to watch the dog for me since my wife wanted some time just the two of us without the dog. I was okay with this when she was going to be at our house with my sister, but my sister's husband got transferred to another state and now they can't watch her. My wife suggested I leave her with her uncle who has a newfoundland and a fenced in yard.

I can't do it, the amount of anxiety I have over something happening to her is insane. She's the perfect dog right now, I'm terrified something is going to happen and I'm going to lose her and then have to go back to what life was like before I got her. I was miserable, no amount of meds helped me, no amount of exercise or eating right made any difference, It was soul crushing and now that I'm better I would do anything to never feel like that again. I know it sounds insane but I had totally given up on ever feeling like a normal person again and then I got Sadie and suddenly I felt like I was me again. I can't even begin to tell you how much of a difference having Sadie has made in my life.

My wife insists everything would be fine and that I'm being a crazy person for not wanting to leave the dog alone to go on a vacation but she understands and says she won't force the issue if I really have a problem with it but I feel like a serious POS for picking a dog over a vacation with my wife. I told her to give me some more time and let me finish her service dog training but she wants me to go on this vacation just the two of us and I'm just horribly uncomfortable leaving her with some stranger I've never even met in a place I've never even been.

27,1ddqmkm,AITA for not inviting anyone from my dad’s side to my baby shower?,"My mom threw me a baby shower this last weekend, and during the planning process, she seemed conscious of the amount of people being invited so I tried to avoid providing input. She never really asked me for a guest list, but my husband sent her a few names of his family members he wanted invited. After invites were sent, my mom told me who she had invited and asked if I wanted anyone else invited. At that point, about 30 invites had been sent out and everyone I wanted to be there was included, so I left it alone. The party was held at my house, but it was organized, set up, and paid for by my mom. We have a large yard, but wouldnt have been able to accommodate that many people inside if the weather turned bad, and parking would have been questionable. 

To keep the count down, we limited it to ladies only, but invited ladies from my moms side (immediate and extended family) and a few ladies from my husband’s side (immediate and extended family we both know and see). I honestly didn’t even notice my husband had included family from both sides of his family.

The party was this weekend, and there ended up being around 25 adults and 10 children at the event, so it was definitely the upper limit of people we could accomodate for parking, and it was the perfect size for being able to provide the kids with space to play, and comfortably seat the adults. 

The thing is, I didn’t really think to invite anyone from my dad’s side of the family. My parents have been divorced for 20 years, so my mom probably didn’t think of it either. I’m not estranged from my dad, but we’re not close either. He saw some tagged photos on social media and was extremely upset that I’d had a baby shower and his mom hadn’t been invited. I tried to be vague about the details to avoid hurting his feelings any more, but my dad could see my husband’s family in the photos too. From the photos, it was clear that my extended family had been invited (mom’s cousins, grandparents siblings, etc.), my friends, and even my husband’s family.

I feel awful for forgetting to invite them, but I don’t talk to most of his family or see them often at all—maybe every 5 years or so depending on the relative. Had I added on aunts/cousins/grandparents from his side, it would have meant an additional 10 people, all of whom I don’t see or talk to outside of family reunions every few years.

From the photos, it was clear that my extended family had been invited (mom’s cousins, grandparents siblings, etc.), my friends, and even my husband’s family.

I feel awful for forgetting to invite them, but I don’t talk to most of his family or see them often at all—maybe every 5 years or so depending on the relative. Had I added on aunts/cousins/grandparents from his side, it would have meant an additional 10 people, all of whom I don’t see or talk to outside of family reunions every few years. 


AITA for not including my dad’s side too?

28,1ddqijw,AITA for not giving my stepmother some of my inheritance ,"My stepmother, let’s call her Amy (now 59), was married to my father for over 20 years. She was quite a bit younger than my dad, but (plot twist) was the main breadwinner in the relationship. My dad was an alcoholic, had other mental health issues, and in his latter years had dementia, too, so didn’t work for most of their marriage. While she did take care of him financially, she did not take care of him in other ways - she was very dismissive of mine and my older brothers efforts to get him help for his alcoholism, and in fact moved back to her home country towards the end there when he was behaving oddly and showing signs of dementia, essentially abandoning him. Because of all this, she and my brother no longer speak at all. 

By the time he passed away two years ago, he had joined her in her home country, and together neither of them worked. By this point they had spent all the money that he had saved up early in his career when he was a high earner, as well as most of what she made in her high six figures job. They were just sloppy with money, did not know how to budget and blew a ton on dinners out, fancy hotels when traveling, and of course insane amounts of alcohol due to his disease. They did pay for my and my brother’s college tuition and housing expenses early on in their marriage, though that was stipulated as part of my parents’ divorce settlement. 

All this to say, in the last few years of his life, it became clear that they had spent all their money, and their retirement plan was basically wait until my grandfather died, and then live off of my dad’s share of that inheritance - about 350k. Unfortunately for her, my dad passed a few months before his father, so she received nothing. Also, because he barely worked in the twenty years that he was married to her, and she is not an American citizen, my mom (who was also married to my dad for 20 years) is receiving more of his social security benefits than she is. 

She now finds herself destitute somehow, and is apparently at risk of losing her mother’s home in her home country that she inherited when she passed. She already lost the home she shared with my dad in the US, along with all of their possessions. My brother and I never received anything when our dad passed - we were never expecting money, but family photos, his monogrammed cufflinks, other mementos would have been nice. All that is gone now, I assume repossessed and auctioned off without our knowledge. 

When my grandfather died, my brother and I split the inheritance that my dad would have received. Amy is now asking that we give her a monthly allowance to keep her afloat, because she is too grief stricken to work though it has been a few years. I refuse to do this and am no longer speaking with her either. AITA?

31,1ddqamk,AITA for telling my dad there's no reason to use a push mower,"Hi everyone,   
I (23M) was back at home visiting family for the first part of the summer before I went back to college to start my summer job. My mom is recovering from surgery, so I knew I would be doing more of the chores than usual. For context, my mom absolutely loves housework and yardwork, and she likes it done in a hyperspecific extremely detail oriented way. She once told me I mowed the lawn wrong because the streaks left weren't perfectly straight. 

Two years ago, she bought a ride lawn mover after she stopped using a mowing service, and it has been working very well (it also leaves more uniform streaks too apparently). She still has a push mower for that 1% of the yard that can't safely be accessed by a ride on mower. 

So my parents pick me up from the airport, and right when we get home, my dad, who doesn't live with us full time anymore, points at the yard and says, ""See, OP that's your job."" I tell him that I can do it very easily with the ride on mower. He says it would be inappropriate to use the ride on mower while my mom is recovering because ""we need to see that you are putting in the work for your mom."" I say that it makes no sense for me to use a push mower instead of a ride on mower for the 99% of the yard that can be done with it. He then tells me that I'm lazy and need to just do what he says so I ""really understand the value of hard work."" 

I then say it's ridiculous that he doesn't want me to use something that will make me get the job done faster, better, and less laborious all because he just wants to see me doing manual labor. Even my mom said she doesn't care if I use the ride on as long as it gets done.

32,1ddq4q9,"AITA for running away with my boyfriend after he called me ""insults""","Me (19F) and my boyfriend “Hee-Haw” (20M), have been dating for 3 years, friends since middle school and knew about each other a year or two before that, (our mothers are coworkers and live close by). 

Start middle school we were both two little fatties, in different classes and would get picked on by our peers, all you need to know is he got the names “elephant” and “pig” (in our native language) and they'd make elephant and pig sounds to bother him, for me it was “mango face” and “the lumberjack’s beast”/”donkey” (it's a saying in my country that refers to a donkey that carries wood a lumberjack gathers because they are all scratched up and bruised from the wood, people use it to describe anyone unkempt/ ugly, the girl that started it probably felt so smart lol).

Next year we were in the same class and we've been a team since, somehow we survived middle school and in high school we started calling each other those names as a joke, and honestly it really helped me get over how I felt about myself and those mean girls back then, Hee-Haw says it feels the same for him. Point is we are numb to these nicknames, and consider them affectionate (though I do like dropping “my sugar honey” every now and again to make him feel embarrassed)

Yesterday we went to buy ice-cream and soda sometime around noon between my classes and before Hee-Haw had to leave for his, so we decided to take the scenic route and walk through the park in our neighborhood. Hee-Haw likes taking his time walking, meanwhile I like jogging or speed walking. We were having a conversation about this and that's why I challenged him to a race and started running ahead.

So here is were maybe we fucked up, Hee-Haw knows I fall over myself when I'm running and laughing so he started saying things to make me laugh like: “think of the grave’s torture ‘donkey’?!” (I swear it makes sense in our language, it's like a villain monologue about how I should fear betraying him). We didn't notice but a family walked into the park, and the mother approached him. Hee-Haw immediately just started saying “sorry” over and over, he says “I didn't know how to explain”, she started lecturing him about how inappropriate it is to call a woman those things. 

Once I got back next to them he gestured towards me and said “explain!” I think I panicked too because I tried making the situation funny by: making pig noises. We both busted out laughing and he said between laughter “not like this mango face!”, which led to the woman calling her husband over. When I noticed, I grabbed Hee-Haw's hand and genuinely started running.

Now, he feels bad that we made a scene and ran away and wants us to find a way to clear things up with the woman. I feel like it was an innocent mistake, and she probably figured it out when we both started laughing. After much debate we decided to do the adult thing and leave it up to reddit, so AITA?

35,1ddpmv2,AITA for calling my friends out during a group swiping on Hinge?,"Last week I (22M) was hanging out with a 4 other friends (two M, two F, similar age to me). One of the girls, let's call her Mary, came up with the idea of going through her Hinge likes together, which there were a lot (showing up as 50+ on the app). I sat next to them watching. However, I felt that they were not seriously assessing the guys. 

All of them just kept laughing at what they wrote, at their pictures or their prompts. Some of the guys had a OK profile, but were 'X'ed because our friends did not like them. For a lot of profiles, they 'X'ed in less than 2 seconds after simply looking at their first picture and without scrolling down to see their profiles in full. Because Mary was not holding the phone herself, there were a few guys who caught Mary's attention but got immediately 'X'ed by our friends who did not like their vibes. As they went along, I asked them a few times why they 'X'ed that particular profile and my friends' response (not Mary's) was like 'no reason' or 'I don't like his vibe'. I then said they should at least spend more time to read the profile in full instead of swiping within a few seconds, but they didn't care. Mary also didn't care herself because all of them were laughing and having a good time swiping, and she had so many likes that she couldn't care less about them. At the end, I was annoyed and called them out for being a bit unfair to those people. Because I kept questioning them and calling them out, they thought I ruined the vibe, then stopped Hinge and moved on to talking other stuff.

I admit that I called my friends out not because I was feeling sympathetic to any of those guys who got 'X'ed, but because I have been unsuccessful on Hinge. All of us (except Mary and I) have a partner already. Mary, despite not having a long-term partner, is always having different situationships. However, despite having used Hinge (and even paid for it) for a year, I have had absolutely no luck on there. I barely have matches and have had 0 dates. When I saw them swiping profiles like a game, I was so angry because I know they might have spent a lot of time polishing their profiles, writing a pick-up line before sending Mary a like, just like me. However, a lot of profiles we like (like Mary) might not even spend 2 seconds reading our profile. They were just laughing at us and treated it as a fun group activity. Yes, I ruined their 'swiping game' because I was jealous, but I think I had my points. Those people might or might not be Mary's type, but Mary would never know because they were laughing their ass off and made a decision within a few seconds without going through the whole profile.

When I saw them swiping profiles like a game, I was so angry because I know they might have spent a lot of time polishing their profiles, writing a pick-up line before sending Mary a like, just like me. However, a lot of profiles we like (like Mary) might not even spend 2 seconds reading our profile. They were just laughing at us and treated it as a fun group activity. Yes, I ruined their 'swiping game' because I was jealous, but I think I had my points. Those people might or might not be Mary's type, but Mary would never know because they were laughing their ass off and made a decision within a few seconds without going through the whole profile.

36,1ddphd3,AITA for not trusting my husband because he only wants me to have attractive friends?,"I’ve never cared much about the physical appearances of people in my life. I would much rather have a friend that has a beautiful soul and sense of humor but may be ‘conventionally unattractive’ than someone who is pretty with a bad personality. Just to set the scene, that also applies to my romantic relationships. On a purely pragmatic approach, I am more ‘conventionally attractive’ than my husband but he was a pretty decent man so that wasn’t something that mattered to me.

Over the years I have known him, I have had close friends of all shapes and sizes and attractiveness levels. Again, I don’t care about that stuff. He sure does though, and it has started to get a lot worse. One of my closest friends for a while was a larger bodied girl, and every single time I hung out with her he had something crappy to say about her looks and size. I have one friend that is really pretty, and when I would hang out with her he wouldn’t stop talking about how I should bring her around more often and make threesome jokes even though he knows I am not attracted to women and would never do that.

Over the past couple years he has just started coming out and saying I should have more ‘hot’ friends because someone like me ‘deserves them’. Wtf?? He met one of my new coworkers recently and will. not. stop. talking about her. He wants me to become friends with her and bring her around. Except I don’t want to be friends with this girl, her personality kind of sucks and she is not the brightest bulb. And yet, her name keeps coming up even after I told him about that.

All of this behavior of his has started to make me not trust him, at all. Especially not around attractive women. Like does he want me to have hot friends just so he can stare at them when they are around? Or so he can try something more? I’ve never been a very jealous person but he has (especially anytime the smallest mention of an ex comes up) and I don’t understand why he thinks this behavior isn’t a huge red flag. It has started to make me less attracted to him as his personality is turning out to be a lot different than when we got together.

Hello i am female 19 years old and play Volleyball in my university. The teams are mixed and there are a lot of levels. It went from beginners to level 3. i would consider myself in the middle of it but because of the fact that I broke my wrist I did not play for 2 month and i started to play 2 weeks ago so i am not quiet at my old level yet but still better than beginner. 
Today we made 4 teams and somehow i was in the team with only new starters so you can guess how the game went. 
We had no gameflow and it was horrible. After the second game 2 more people joined and the trainer said they could play in our team. Then I went to the trainer and asked if i could switch teams 1. cause now we were 8 and i didnt want that 2 people had to be exchanged and 2. i wanted a team where they had more moves than just servings. So i asked him „hey I know it doesnt sound nice but could I switch teams cause I want more game flow“. Then the trainer said „well to be honest you are not way better than them. If you want me to take this question serios you should be at least way better than now. And i dont want this. I want respect for players that are not good and want to get better but yeah you can play with team xy“ that team had only 5 players so it was perfect. Now i understand what he means but i never said that the other ones were bad. I never said i was better. But i think that you learn volleyball more when you play with good players where you can watch and imitade and not just watch people drop the ball. 

I dont know if I am the asshole cause i just wanted the chance to play to get better and not watch how other people drop the ball.

39,1ddp0qu,AITA for Letting My Mom Lecture My Bf?,"
My boyfriend and I (20M and 20F) have been together for almost a year. I'm an only child of divorced parents and have lived with my mother my whole life, making us very close. I've struggled with drug addiction, which strained but ultimately strengthened our relationship. Given my history of lying due to addiction, trust between my mother and me is fragile.

On the other hand, my boyfriend comes from a large but dysfunctional family. He's always been the victim of his parents' arguments. They live together, but they're not close.

His background has made him a difficult partner, showing patterns of jealousy and distrust since the beginning of our relationship. These started as jokes but escalated into him screaming and starting fights daily. Understanding his family dynamic, I've been patient and conciliatory, offering reassurance, sharing my location and passwords, and finding compromises.

This month, stress from uni intensified our fights as I couldn't be as present. Despite texting and calling him whenever possible, our inability to meet physically triggered his trust issues even more. The stress of everything affected my relationship with my mother, who became paranoid that I was using drugs again. I avoid discussing my relationship issues with her to prevent over-involvement. My boyfriend believes that relationship issues should remain within the couple and finds discussing them with parents unacceptable.

Reaching a breaking point, I confided in my mom about our relationship struggles, hoping to alleviate her paranoia. I explained everything sympathetically towards my boyfriend's pov to prevent her from over-involving. She mostly understood but suggested sitting down with my bf to talk ""from a mother's perspective,"" an idea I rejected knowing he would hate it. I assured her I could handle it and that we could discuss it more if I needed advice but emphasized that talking directly to him was too much.

The next day, my bf and I planned to meet at my house before going out for dinner. While I was getting ready, he went to chat with my mom, as usual. After some time, sensing tension, I went to the kitchen to find my mom lecturing my boyfriend, exactly what I had asked her not to do. I felt guilty for both telling her and not anticipating this. Panicking, I intervened, thanked my mom for her intentions but said we could handle it ourselves, and apologized to my boyfriend. As we left the house, I knew a confrontation was coming. He didn't speak until we arrived, where he began a screaming fight, accusing me of sabotaging our relationship and calling my mom ""a crazy woman who raised a crazy daughter."" His words hurt deeply, given my mother's importance to me. For the first time, I snapped back, expressing my frustration with his constant tantrums and yelling. He insisted our arguments were never his fault and i am insane for thinking that, leaving me questioning everything.

I wouldn't mind as much if they fed them in the large vacant field behind the bike path, but I suppose since these people are walking on the trail they figure let me feed them here. 

Well this is quite a nuisance for runners and bikers trying to workout/ get places quickly using these trails. The only other option is go in the road, but the risk of getting struck by a car is pretty hight (especially in this specific area). 

So today I was commuting by bike and see 50+ geese sitting on the bike bath, obstructing anyone from passing. People are sitting on a bench right there feeding them and recording videos. So I repeatedly ring my bell and pump by disc breaks which make a squealing noise as I approach without reducing speed.

42,1ddorxp,AITA for not changing my wedding date for my mothers honeymoon even though she's paid a downpayment and I haven't?,"So my partner (29f) and I (32f) have been engaged over 2 years. We've told people we're planning the wedding for next May. I have just started formally planning a few weeks ago. Venues and caterers are chosen, a date has been set, but “save the date” cards haven't been sent, and down payments haven’t been paid yet.

Context for our choice of month:

Having an outdoor May wedding is pretty much the only thing we’ve been sure of since the engagement. We want an outdoor wedding so the months from October-March are off the table. Venues in my area are more expensive in summer months (June, July, August) and while we are stable, we are not well-off. September and April are big months for birthdays (including both of ours). Additionally, I am a professor so April is a hectic month for me as that is exam time in our country so I’m typically grading until the wee hours of the night. So… that left us with May.

The issue:

I am spending so much time explaining our choice of month because it turns out my mother (60's) and her new husband(60's) will be honeymooning all of next May. My mother and I have a fine relationship but are not particularly close. I have 100% told her we were planning for may, but she obviously doesn’t remember. My mother has put a payment down on her honeymoon. I only found out about her honeymoon this weekend when I called to tell her the date was set (her wedding was this year).

She keeps texting me alternative dates that we could do the wedding. But, and here’s where I might be the asshole, I don’t want to. I like the date we’ve chosen. We put a lot of thought into this. She is right, we could change it without any cost to us, but other months don’t work well for various reasons. I did offer to comprise by moving it early may and have her push her honeymoon back a few days, but this was rejected. This date will be our anniversary for the rest of our life. It will be the day where we schedule extra special weekends away and fancy dinners. The date of a honeymoon isn't as special, she could change it if she wanted.

It is also worth noting here that the two of them are very well-off. For context they own 3 homes and go on international vacations at least twice a year. Moving the honeymoon after placing a downpayment will be inconvenient, but it will not hurt them financially and they have almost a years notice to reschedule it. Additionally, me and my fiance are paying for the wedding entirely ourselves.

That being said… they do have a downpayment and we don’t. They have had this date set longer than us. And it is a honeymoon, not just a regular vacation. Also it’s not like a cousin can’t go, its my MOTHER. Should I change the date for her? I do want her there.

43,1ddop6k,AITA for not giving up my dad’s Taylor Swift ticket?,"I (19f) and my mom got tickets to the Eras tour for the fall in Miami. We were so excited because we were unable to get tickets to our home show. We are planning to get an Airbnb in Florida and make it a family vacation. We got four tickets so my brother and dad could come too.

While we were buying the tickets, my uncle found out and asked if him and his daughter could come with to Florida because he hates traveling alone and wanted to take a trip. He even offered to pay half of the Airbnb. We said yes and that has been the plan since we got the tickets last summer.

A few days ago, my mom was talking to my uncle and he said that he assumed that his daughter would get my dad’s Taylor Swift ticket because he knows my dad is not really a Taylor Swift fan.

Apparently, he’s been making these comments all year to my dad and my dad has been responding, “It’s up to [my name]”. If I asked him to, he’d give up his ticket because he is mainly coming to experience this with the rest of the family and not really as a fan. 

This is where I might be the asshole, I told my uncle that it was always my dad’s ticket and I want him there. My uncle said that his daughter is an actual fan and she would benefit more from having the ticket. He said that he might as well not go now.

I feel bad because he already told his daughter that she would get to go but my dad has been listening to Taylor Swift in the car, asking about the meanings behind different songs and he is a huge Kelce brother fan so he has been planning on wearing a Jason jersey and my brother is going to wear a Travis jersey. (My dad likes Folklore and Evermore and my brother likes Speak Now and Reputation)

Hello all - long post ahead.

My gf and I have been dating for almost 2 years, and we live in NYC. My gf is originally from overseas and is working in the U.S. on OPT (this is relevant). My family lives in Maryland, and I have 1 brother (30sM) who also lives in the NYC area.

\~4 years ago, my dad was diagnosed with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. For those who don't know what that is, it's akin to ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease. Based on his symptoms, we think the disease progression actually began somewhere between 6-7 years ago. The typical prognosis for this disease is 6-9 years. It's an awful disease, and I wouldn't wish anyone or the loved ones suffer the same thing.

My mom has been my dad's primary caregiver since 2021, when my brother and I had to return to NYC for our jobs. For the most part, she has tried to let us live normal lives, and not ask us to come home unless she really needs our help (e.g., she's had minor medical procedures that I've come home for to drive her to). Nevertheless, my brother and I have alternated coming home every \~1 month for \~1 week at a time to try to relieve the burden on her. We both always knew that at some point we would have to come back for a more extended period of time.

Since the beginning of this year, my dad's condition has progressed dramatically, and he is receiving in-home hospice care services. He can no longer talk, and must use a wheelchair. We have to assist him with all aspects of daily life - eating, bathing, medication, using the bathroom, dressing, getting in/out of his wheelchair. He also has bouts of pneumonia now, and periods of incontinence. (If you've ever had to clean up a parent's feces, you know how emotionally battering it is to see them in this state. There is something fundamentally backwards about taking care of a parent like they're a baby, but that's for me and my future therapist to discuss).

Because of my dad's condition, my girlfriend had not met my parents until very recently. My mom is a very private person, and she's always wanted to spare my dad the indignity of other people seeing him in his current state. However, I've been at my parents' house since mid-April when I took a leave of absence from work. I will be going to grad school in the fall, at which point my brother will come live at home. My dad's condition is at a point where my mom can't handle him on her own anymore. We are looking into caregiver agencies, but the process of picking one is slow, and they are expensive to hire. We won't be able to afford hired help indefinitely, and so we want to 'save' it for a time when it's absolutely necessary.

Because of this, my girlfriend has come to stay with me twice in the last couple of months. Everyone got along fine. My girlfriend brought small gifts for my mom and tried to be as helpful as she can. My mom was polite to my girlfriend, and made a lot of conversation with her.

My girlfriend had some health issues come up recently (primarily due to stress from work). In late May, she had an appointment with a primary care provider to take FMLA leave from work. I returned to NYC from MD a day early to accompany her to this appointment.

My girlfriend had a follow-up appointment scheduled for this past Friday. She originally asked me at the beginning of the week if I would be able to accompany her because she was anxious about it. Under normal circumstances, I would've, no questions asked. However, because I was in Maryland to help my mom with my dad, I didn't feel comfortable doing so without running it past my mom first. I asked my mom if I could go back to NYC on Thursday night, and come back home immediately after on Friday morning. She did say she thought it was unnecessary for me to go all that way for a 30 minute doctor's appointment, which I agree is dismissive of my girlfriend's feelings. My girlfriend suggested that my brother come home for the night to cover for me, but that would involve 2 people each traveling 3 hours each way so that I could attend a doctor's appointment with my girlfriend, which my mom veto'ed.

I do understand where my girlfriend was coming from, as her family all lives overseas, and I am the closest relationship she has in the U.S. (see, I told you that detail would be relevant!). Thankfully, the appointment went smoothly.

The next part of this story requires some more context: my mom has had clinical depression since I was a child. She has had ""meltdowns"" in the past where she becomes trapped in her own dark thoughts and won't listen to reason or anything we say. These were infrequent before, but have become more common as my dad has gotten sicker. Right now, the common theme of these is that after my dad passes, and her parents pass, she's worried my brother and I will abandon her (which won't happen). When she gets like this, she tends to lash out at people. I've been the subject of it in the past. It's terrifying to witness, and is worse because she's still my mother. I know she would benefit from therapy/psychiatric help, but I don't think now is the time to add that stress on top of what my family is going through. 

More recently, I had a big argument when my mom asked me if my girlfriend wanted me to return to NYC. I said, of course she likes it better when I'm there with her. My mom then asked if it was my girlfriend pushing me to find a caregiver agency. I have independently brought it up several times recently, especially after my dad's latest episode of incontinence, because I don't feel like we (my mom, brother, and I) are equipped to deal with this kind of thing. My mom started spiraling, and called my girlfriend irresponsible. She said I don't have that much longer left with my dad, and didn't think it was right for my girlfriend to try to take me away from him.

I will admit that I fucked up here. I tried to explain that it was my idea, that my girlfriend was just suggesting the caregiver idea because she knows my mom can't do it alone anymore (my mom has told her that in the past), but my mom wouldn't listen to anything. She said to not let my girlfriend come to her house anymore. Note that my gf was in NYC at the time, so I relayed what happened to her over the phone.

I ended up getting into an argument with my mom the next day, where I told her she didn't have to love my girlfriend but she shouldn't hate her. My mom is a very stubborn person, and I don't foresee that changing. Moreover, I don't think she is in a state of mind to have a rational discussion about any of this. I know she's being unfair to my girlfriend; I also know that there's nothing I can do or say to change how she feels at the moment. My brother called her several times, and I know he tried to defend my girlfriend, but my mom wouldn't budge.

My girlfriend has asked me to stand up to my mom / defend her if she says negative things about her in the past. This is a very reasonable request to me. However, I know my mom, and I know that when she has one of her depressive episodes, there is no talking back to her. I was honest with my girlfriend about this. My girlfriend wants me to distance myself from my mom in the future, which I semi-agree with. I am definitely abiding by her decisions at this time because of my father, and I will not need to do so in the future. But I would not feel comfortable shutting her out of my life completely. My mom is still my mom, and she essentially raised me as a single parent when I entered high school, as my dad lived and worked overseas at the time.

My girlfriend has said if this happens again, that she won't take it anymore and she will leave this situation entirely. I don't blame her in the slightest for feeling this way. We have been arguing on and off over the last couple of days about this whole thing. I can't defend her from my mom, and I can't change how my mom acts. My girlfriend keeps asking me to come up with a plan to stop this in the future. Right now, I can't see past the next few months. I can't really see past what will happen after my dad passes away.

Hello all - long post ahead.

My gf and I have been dating for almost 2 years, and we live in NYC. My gf is originally from overseas and is working in the U.S. on OPT (this is relevant). My family lives in Maryland, and I have 1 brother (30sM) who also lives in the NYC area.

45,1ddoj95,WIBTA If I tell my mom to leave me alone?,"I[19F] have 2 parents [Mom 41F and Dad 42M]. We've never had a close relationship once I past the age of 6. My childhood years were filled with me begging them to watch tv with me, play dolls, snowball fights or anything I saw happy families do on youtube or tv. [side note: a lot of those we didn't do before I turned 7 but it was at that age they started to tune me out] 

However, recently I started noticing since quarantine my mom has gotten weirdly clingy. She's been wanting to watch movies, play games or just want me in the room with her when she's doing things. I was fine with it for the most part, but now she's just really weird. For the past few months, she's been wanting to do stuff together everyday for hours on end. It's mostly watching movies or tv shows but I'm starting to feel suffocated. 

For starters, it's never a movie we both wanna watch it's always something she likes. I admit she's put me on to some good movies but now it's like she doesn't care if I like it, she wants to watch it so we have to. The past few days she's been making me watch Bridgerton with her and I don't like it. The characters infuriate me, and the storylines aren't that interesting. She doesn't care, she just barges into my room as soon as I come home and says ""BRIDGERTON TIME!!"" 

I just want some time to myself. I've gotten used to being alone in this house, but now she's not working and wants to spend all her time with me. Whenever I tell her I wanna be alone she just tells me ""don't be like that"" and it's getting really annoying. WIBTA if I told her to leave me alone?

46,1ddoh3w,AITA for taking my brothers phone,"So I (15m) and my brother (11m) get along pretty well despite differences in interests and everything. Since he is going into middle school this year I got him a iPhone for his 11th birthday. It wasn’t too expensive but still pretty big for my minimum wage paycheck. All was fine until a few days ago I came home from school to hear him yelling at a game. This wasn’t out of the ordinary since he plays this game pretty often. I just went into my room and got ready for the shift I had in a hour or so. Only like 20 minutes later I hear him nearly screaming the n word at the top of his lungs over and over. We are very very white. We have French and Scottish descent on both our parents sides. In the moment I just texted my dad who was at work telling him about it and went off since my grandfather was downstairs waiting to drive me to work.

Once I come home from work everything seemed normal and I expected that my dad did something while I was gone and it was dealt with. Not even a minute later he was back on the game and I learn that this wasn’t even the first time he’s done this. Both times now he’s gotten a talking to with zero consequences. The only thing he got was the promise of his game being taken away the next time it happened. I thought this was weird since talking to him didn’t work the first time and that probably meant it wouldn’t the second. For a while I left it but after talking to my mom and telling her how I thought it wouldn’t work she outright told me that this was how they were going to solve it and he’s been told what would happen if he said it again. Generally what I did for a day is ignore him and go on with my day trying to keep little contact with him.

Yesterday, I was sick and stayed home for half of the school day. He gets home around 2:30/2:45 and I had just been in my room until he started yelling again. I got up to tell him to quiet down since I had a pretty bad headache and I hear him screaming words like “black” and other slurs with the people he was online with. I just went in and told him if he wanted to be someone who was like that that I’d treat him like someone who said that kind of stuff. I took the phone I gave him telling him that he didn’t deserve the phone before leaving and going back into my room. 

Over the last day my parents have been up my ass telling me how I couldn’t do something like that even if I did own it and pay for it for him.

Or at least we've never had a mother daughter, I know what one looks like and everytime I imagine it with my mom it's very uncomfortable. 

Looking back now and based on how I feel I'd give her the term guardian. She's taken care of me but on emotional level I'm just not there tbh, I don't want a relationship with her.

I grew up in a household with constant yelling and arguments, I have a brother but I feel like an only child tbh. Parents got divorced, more yelling, more berating. I understand why she yells, I understand why she's mean, and I understand it's because of her childhood. Her mom let to many things go as a kid so SHE can't let the minor things go now, so she lashes out. She needs help, I recognize that, but I can't help, to be honest I don't want to. I think over the years the less I wanted her attention, so thats how I got where I am now. 

She's emotional manipulative and I don't think she realizes it (if you want examples ask me and I'll provide examples), obviously I observed her over the years and I know her behaviors, I would never tell her out right because everytime I communicate my feelings toward her she uses it against, I learned to just do what's she wants and I'll continue to do so. 

Anyway I got into and Ivy league college and a bunch of scholarships so I'm getting out my state. My mom asked if she could join me and we get a apartment together and I kinda laughed it off. Later my cousin who was there at the time asked why I didn't answer her and I kinda poured out how I felt about her to him.(He was kinda my safe space, family in general is very weird for me, I've been on my own for a long time) Which was bad cause he told my aunt and she told her husband and it got back to my mom with a lot of things out of context. 

So she went off on me, and we haven't talked in days, my mom's side of the family are calling me ungrateful and selfish, and I don't know what to do.

Obviously if I am wrong I gotta work out why i feel the way I feel you know.

Or at least we've never had a mother daughter, I know what one looks like and everytime I imagine it with my mom it's very uncomfortable. 

Looking back now and based on how I feel I'd give her the term guardian. She's taken care of me but on emotional level I'm just not there tbh, I don't want a relationship with her.

I grew up in a household with constant yelling and arguments, I have a brother but I feel like an only child tbh. Parents got divorced, more yelling, more berating. I understand why she yells, I understand why she's mean, and I understand it's because of her childhood. Her mom let to many things go as a kid so SHE can't let the minor things go now, so she lashes out. She needs help, I recognize that, but I can't help, to be honest I don't want to. I think over the years the less I wanted her attention, so thats how I got where I am now. 

She's emotional manipulative and I don't think she realizes it (if you want examples ask me and I'll provide examples), obviously I observed her over the years and I know her behaviors, I would never tell her out right because everytime I communicate my feelings toward her she uses it against, I learned to just do what's she wants and I'll continue to do so. 

Anyway I got into and Ivy league college and a bunch of scholarships so I'm getting out my state. My mom asked if she could join me and we get a apartment together and I kinda laughed it off. Later my cousin who was there at the time asked why I didn't answer her and I kinda poured out how I felt about her to him.(He was kinda my safe space, family in general is very weird for me, I've been on my own for a long time) Which was bad cause he told my aunt and she told her husband and it got back to my mom with a lot of things out of context. 

So she went off on me, and we haven't talked in days, my mom's side of the family are calling me ungrateful and selfish, and I don't know what to do.

Obviously if I am wrong I gotta work out why i feel the way I feel you know.

50,1ddnv9w,AITA for going to visit my nephew at my SIL home after her & my brother have split?,"Advice please 

Poss TW - DV, depression & mother/daughter relationships

my brother (27m) (who I've never actually got along with but for some reason my Mum (59f) seems to think does no wrong, despite the fact he constantly steals and lies to her) has a child (3m) with his now ex wife (33f). They split last year due to DV (brother being the perpetrator) and if it wasn't for me keeping a relationship with my SIL, my Mum and brother wouldn't have contact with my nephew. SIL refused for any contact because brother and Mum were very horrible to her (don't get me wrong, SIL gave some back) but I arranged for brother and Mum to see nephew once a month (now twice a month). The whole thing had me incredibly stressed but my sole aim was so they could have contact. 

My brother lives 2 hours away from SIL and nephew. My Mum drives to pick up nephew and drop him off. Brother doesn't pay my Mum petrol money etc and just takes advantage of it. 

I happen to be travelling down to where my SIL lives, we always got on and I haven't seen my nephew since September. I messaged her and we've arranged for me to stay over for a couple of days and spend some quality time with my nephew. 

My Mum has massively kicked off at me saying I've gone behind brothers back and I'm being selfish. Since then she's hardly spoken to me and I feel like I'm forcing conversation. We used to speak every single day and now it's hardly anything. It's gotten me so depressed because we usually have a great relationship, but I feel like this has ruined it as she's taking my brothers side on this despite me explaining the only thing that matters is my nephew. 

I just feel like I'm fighting a losing battle and I miss the relationship I had with my Mum but I can't stand being around my brother. Every time I'm around him he's moody, doesn't bother with nephew, takes photos for instagram and then leaves him alone. He's ruined a lot of special memories for us in the past and has always managed to make things about him (our relationship runs a lot deeper than this as I'm sure you can tell) but all in all he's just not a nice person. 

How do I get this relationship back with my Mum? AITA for arranging to see nephew? I feel like if I back down and cancel seeing them it's just another time of my brother kicking off and getting his own way.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-11,"AITA for going to visit my nephew at my SIL home after her & my brother have split?

About a month ago, we had an argument over text on Instagram, and since I had her account, I got notifications about her conversations.

57,1ddmtvb,AITA for yelling at my boyfriend over unfair treatment?,"My boyfriend (20M) and I (19F) have been having so many arguments lately. There has always been a huge gap in effort and romantic gestures, which mainly come from me. I put in all my effort to treat him as good as I possibly can- I plan dates, trips, I drive an hour to his house, I go over when he's sick to take care of him, and the list only continues. I have told him in the past that I treat him the way that I'd like to be treated so that he can have examples of what id appreciate. He doesn't seem to really go out of his way for much more than driving to my house to hang out or paying for dinner. If i want a date, I have to bring it up and basically do all the work myself. If I want to hang out, I have to tell him when I'm available and I have to keep track of both of our schedules to see when we could hang out. As you can probably tell, I adore him with my entire heart and would give him everything he asks for. I try my best to make him good food, tea, gifts, and everything else because I want him to be happy. Seeing his smile is worth so much to me, and i don't care if it hurts me in order to be able to see that.

I've also told him previously that I don't feel appreciated or cared for like I am his girlfriend. I end up feeling like just a friend or a friend with benefits. I know he loves me and I don't doubt it, but I dont understand why he isn't willing to go through the same efforts that I do.

I ordered him food twice in the past 2 nights, past 12am because he mentioned really wanting them. Fast forward to today, my period started and I become in crippling pain for the next 24 hours. I'm sobbing and hungry and the pain just overwhelms me to where it feels like I can't move. He calls me eventually, aware of whats going on, and makes no effort to come see me (he doesn't have work today), and simply says that ""oh I have stuff to do at home"". No mention of what stuff and I doubt it's not something he could hold off on to come hold me and help me. I also just kept telling him how hungry I was and that I need Tylenol, too, but that i was in too much pain to drive and get anything. In the end, he decided to say to me that ""I can't order you food but I'll pay for it or something if you ask""... to which I told him it's literally a single app to download, which he is aware of.

AITH for then yelling at him that he doesn't seem to think about me in times like this? He didn't offer to get me food even though I just went through the lengths of getting it for him the past two nights, which really hurts, and he just doesn't seem to care for me like i care for him. I don't get why I can't be shown the same love. It's hard getting him to do small things for me, which I always have to ask for, and it really sucks that I feel I can't be treated with kindness.

58,1ddmtsa,AITA For rescinded a travel offer to my stepdaughter and her family and inviting my son and his family instead,"My parents were missionaries in Africa when I (64M) was growing up.  They have long since passed, but I still keep in touch with friends that still live there and have made a few trips there to visit.  One of these family friends has operated a safari company for decades.  Whenever I visit, I usually stay them for a week or so.  It's been almost 8 years since my last visit and I want to go back.

My ex-wife and I divorced about 15 years ago.  Our son is now 35 and has a wife and twin girls (13).  I remarried 6 years ago and my current wife has a daughter, Pam (38F) from a previous relationship as well who also has her own family.  When I told my wife about wanting to plan another trip to Africa, she was very excited.

I contacted my family friend and he offered me a great deal to stay at their safari camp, but only for a specific 2-week window.  I told my wife about the deal my friend offered and she asked if it would be possible to invite her daughter and her family with on the trip.  I was hesitant because Pam and I have never really seen eye-to-eye, but I figured this might be the type of trip that would bring us closer through a unique shared experience.  

When we first approached Pam about the idea, she was totally on board.  But things went south pretty quick.  First, the window for the trip wouldn't work for them because Pam's daughter has a softball tournament at that time that she ""can't miss.""  They did however offer to help cover the higher cost so that daughter could still make the tournament. 

Next, however, came the dealbreaker.  Pam had asked how I knew my friends there and I explained that my parents were missionaries long ago.  A few days later, she came to visit with her daughters and told me that they are uncomfortable staying with ""colonizers"" and asked if we can change the trip completely.  I straight up told them ""no"" and told them they are no longer welcome to join us on this trip.  It turned into an argument and I had to ask them to leave.  My wife was in tears by the end of it.  

Not wanting to miss out on the deal my friend was offering, I instead extended the invitation to my son and his family.  He jumped at the opportunity without asking any questions.  When I told him about the time window and where we were staying, he said he didn't care and they would make it work.  No hassle.

I told my wife that my son and his family would be joining us on the trip instead and she got mad at me.  She told me that I should have at least tried to talk with Pam about it again to see if we could make it work before inviting my son.  

I told her that I am not going to bring Pam and her family after they insulted my parents and have been making everything more difficult from day one.  I told her my son and his family aren't making this nearly as difficult as Pam has been, and they also didn't call my parents ""colonizers.""

59,1ddmkgq,WIBTA for proposing the day before my gf goes to a bridal shower?,"Fake names used, throwaway / alt account to keep this private. 

I (24M) am planning on proposing to my gf (24F) before my family’s annual get-together on July 20th so that we can announce it to my family then. I’m on a tight deadline with finalizing the ring with the jeweler, getting the photographer set up, etc. so I was planning on purposing on July 13th (the Saturday before the get-together). 

The issue is, my gf’s lifelong friend Harold (24M) is getting married in September and his fiance Carol (25F) is having a bridal shower on July 14th. 

My gf and Harold have been friends since birth because their moms were best friends. Sadly my gf’s mom passed away when she was young which resulted in my gf getting very close with Harold’s mom. So close that we attend most of Harold’s family events. 

It is abundantly clear that Harold’s mom is a huge fan of my gf and to me it seems like Carol is a bit jealous/annoyed by that (likely made worse because Harold’s mom isn’t a huge fan of Carol, although she is still very supportive of their relationship). 

Carol, Harold’s mom and my gf will all be at the bridal shower. 

To make a long story short, I am worried that proposing the day before the bridal shower will steal attention away from Carol and ultimately “ruin” her day especially when Harold’s mom gets super excited at the news. My gf wouldn’t announce it there, but likely everyone would notice and talk about it. 

On the other hand, it means a lot to me that we do this before the family reunion and although I’m going to try to do it sooner, it likely will come down to that day.

They are a 12 hour drive away, and plan to drive to where we live and will rent an Airbnb for 9 days. In May my mom said she wanted to either visit Thanksgiving week because my dad has time off, or in October since the leaves will be changing and it's also around my birthday. I told her twice that we weren’t hosting Thanksgiving at our house, and that October would work better for us, once over message and once in person. I feel bad that we can’t really invite the rest of my siblings, and we just moved into our house this January and I really just don’t feel up for doing the whole dinner,etc. We have three small children.  

Today my mom writes that she’s going to make reservations to come visit for Thanksgiving week and wanted to know if she could make the reservation. I said that Thanksgiving week didn’t work for us, and what about the week after Thanksgiving, or the week before, since part of why they want to visit that week was my dad has three days off surrounding Thanksgiving. She didn’t like that option because they don’t want to drive during holiday travel days. 

She said that they would just come Thanksgiving anyways, and just stay at their airbnb or eat out for Thanksgiving so we don’t have to spend Thanksgiving with them, and asked if we were free the rest of the days Thanksgiving week. That sounded like a terrible idea to me,  I would feel bad going somewhere for thanksgiving while my parents are visiting, but don't want to be pressured into changing our plans because she won't budge on when they are going to be visiting.

They have a large family, and it's already really generous that they invite us over in the first place, since technically we're not related except through sharing in-laws.

She said her aunt had told her this would happen if her children moved away, that we would become too busy and have no time for her.

recently i had just finished a two week placement with a company i fell in love with, and they’re offering me a 3 month extension that has been geared around my holiday date.

then comes my stupidity. i had given the recruiter the wrong date. which was a week later than my actual flight. when i had corrected this to them, they said it’s going to be difficult taking me on because they had planned to have me help with their relocation of the main office, which was taking place a week before the wrong date i had given, and exactly a day before im flying away.

when i told my parents about this mess, they  expected me to prioritise flying home before anything else. They really want me to go back, as i haven’t been there in years. I offered them a compromise by flying there myself a week later which they weren’t happy about, as the money they paid for my ticket would have gone to waste, although i did offer to reimburse them with the money i make from the three months at the company. 

queue one of the worst arguments i’ve ever had with them in my life. if anyone can relate, Asian parents can be hell sometimes. I couldn’t even speak or reason with them without being screamed back at for being ‘disrespectful’. i just cried in front of them hoping they could understand but nothing would go through. they just said not to come at all, which is not what im asking for.

A lot of their reasoning boils down to whether sacrificing a week at our country is worth it for a three month internship. i just wish they understood that 1. the money i make in those three months is most likely gonna be more than enough to pay back the money lost for my part, and 2. even if it was just three months, that type of experience on my CV will help me out so much when looking for a full time graduate position in my field. I just don’t know what to do at this point. my parents are refusing to speak to me as of now.

Currently, my recruiter is having a think over it, but its likely im not gonna get this position if i were to go through with the holiday.

62,1ddm7au,AITA for not going to the zoo with my friend?," Hi all,

So I (M31) have a friend, let's call him Tom (M31) and we have been trying to go to the zoo in our city for almost two months now. We are in a group chat with my boyfriend and one other friend, lets call him A,who works on Sundays so scheduling has been a hassle.

Last weekend, while hanging with other friends, my boyfriend invited these other friends to the zoo this upcoming Saturday. I then reached out to the group chat asking if Tom and A would like to go. A said he could but Tom said he had a date on Saturday and couldn't go. Now, for context, Tom has a habit of falling for people really fast. Like, after one weekend of hanging out, talking about how he might love them and essentially becoming hyperfocused on them to the point he just stops communicating with me.  This has caused girls to feel ""love bombed"" (the words a mutual friend he dated used to describe the attention) and they end up ghosting him or telling him they just want to be friends more often than not. So ghosting is something he really hates but it's gotten to the point where he doesn't even like rescheduling dates because he doesn't want the girls he's seeing to feel bad (his words not mine). 

So when we asked him to reschedule his date he said he couldn't/wouldn't. We were all bummed but he's a grown man so we just accepted it. However, now more and more people are going with us, and I've invited more people including friends I've met through him (it's a group of like 10-12 of us potentially). I felt like it was a nice gesture to reach out and let him know so he didn't feel ostracized. However,  it hurt his feelings and he told me he felt left out and abandoned. That annoyed me so I explained, politely, that he wasn't being excluded, that he could change his schedule, and that we could just go to the zoo another day. He replied that he needed to take a step back from our friendship. So tell me, AITA?

64,1ddlsfn,AITA for not going on a family trip?,"My (22F) family wants to go on a trip end of this year. 

The issue is that I have a narcissistic brother-in-law (32M) who in June 2023 suddenly privately messaged my parents to complain about me being ""disrespectful"" to him. It was actually playful teasing that went both ways, which is why this came out of nowhere for all of us.

I apologised to him via text but he chose to ignore it for a month. We then had a chat that ended with me saying that I need time before I can go back to normal. He felt that I don't have the right to ""need time"" because he's the victim, not me.

In September 2023, he PMed my parents again claiming that l'm treating my other brother in law better than him. This was true because I still held resentment from the way he treated me in June. We then had another chat where my sister and parents told me to treat him like he's a sensitive kid and to apologise to him.

In Feb 2024, he got upset that I sent my sister a postcard and I didn't address him in it. He also lied that I forgot to wish him on his wedding anniversary even though I actually did. He told my sister to stop talking to me and PMed my parents again and told them a whole bunch of lies about me. We had another chat which didn't end well because I decided to stop apologising and I called out his lies. Once again my sister told me to apologise and treat him like someone who's jealous of how close my family is. Being a narcissist, he played the victim and blaming me for causing a strain in his marriage.

After the chat, there was a family medical emergency and everyone else forgot everything that happened. He and I decided to put the past aside. I still don't forgive him for the things he's done but I’m being cordial and pretending that I don't hate him.

I don't want to go on the family trip because l'm going to have to walk on eggshells for 2 weeks hoping that I don’t set him off or else the trip will be ruined. Plus he's good at being charming and making me feel left out because l'm naturally quiet and he's a very loud person. I also can't stand seeing how everyone sucks up to him to keep him happy just so that we have some peace.

I've explained this to my family and although they're all on my side in that he's just a narcissistic hypersensitive prick who's targeting me, they think that I'm thinking too much. My parents keep saying that I'm letting him win if I choose not to go. They will not go ahead with the trip if I don’t go.

65,1ddlr53,AITA for hanging out with my coworker’s ex girlfriend? ,"I (18F) work at a supermarket since september. A little backstory: since around november i’d say i started getting along really well with my coworker and a sort of supervisor Jack (20M). At some point we became so close that we told each other almost everything. He also told me about Ginny (19F), his ex that used to work there as well. Their relationship was toxic and he told me some things about i, but nothing under surface level information. He became a really good friend, but we didn’t really see each other outside of work. We did text on a lot of platforms, and there were instances we helped each other out on mental problems as well. 

Around January, he got a girlfriend, Sarah (19F, important for later). In March, i had gotten SA’d by a guy i didn’t know. Jack was the first one I told, mainly because i wasn’t able to go to work the following week because of this. Jack told me I could always talk to him when needed and all was fine. 

A week later I got a DM on Instagram (our main texting form) from him that he noticed he was starting to feel uncomfortable with how close we were sometimes, and that it felt unfair towards Sarah. He told me he didn’t want us to speak outside of work and about nothing that didn’t involve work. Obviously I was hurt by this but there wasn’t much i could do about it.

Jack and I have since then been okay with each other again, but Saturday we talked about how he’s been going through a lot of things, opening up a little and it felt like old times again. This was all at work so deeper than that wasn’t possible but it was nice.

Fast forward to now: a fellow coworker i get along with became friends with Ginny. At some point I recognised her and said something like hey, you used to date my supervisor lol. We became sort of friends. Jack really didn’t like this and made that very known to me, but I didn’t think much of it and last Saturday me and Ginny went to Mcdonald’s together. It was a lot of fun and she’s incredibly funny. Jack asked with who I was and I told him I was with Ginny. He scolded me and deleted me on almost everything.

I’m sad about it, I feel like an asshole especially since he’s been opening up to me and I really miss our friendship but at the same time, I’m old enough to pick who I want to hang out with and if he doesn’t want to speak to me outside of work, who is he to judge me on this? 

Advice would be nice, I don’t want this to affect the mood at work.

66,1ddlg2e,AITA for calling out a dude I’ve been talking to for refusing to initiate conversation and not listen or care to my feelings and the impression he gives?,"
I’m 23m and have been talking to this guy around my age that I met on Reddit. We’ve been friends on Snap for a while but seems like he’s never interested in talking unless it’s to argue. 

I’ll message sometimes seeing what’s up and he will assume I’m looking to do something else NSFW even when I don’t mention it and is just very short and gives the impression he doesn’t want to talk, despite making tons of posts about being alone and wanting a relationship. 

Because of this I’ve cut back on trying to reach out so now I see him posting about how he’s not “chasing conversation” and that it’s a “two way street” so I told him how I feel on it saying how I get the impression he doesn’t want to talk and he just starts going on a hypocritical argument that makes zero sense. 

He says he’s not gonna initiate conversation and I tell him it seems like you don’t want to talk to me and he proceeds to go on saying that he has too many friends Snap so it’s hard to be personable with everyone which I get, but doesn’t make sense considering he said he’s not interested in conversation. 

I also told him how I feel regarding it and he just tells me “I’m not responsible for other people’s feelings” which I get but when it comes to a relationship you can’t just be stubborn and refuse to hear anyone else’s opinion and I called him out on that saying that you can’t complain about being alone if you don’t want to talk to people and refuse to listen or accept how other people feel. 

He goes on to argue more saying I’m on a high horse and “perfection” for calling him out on it and not once denied he was interested in talking to me.

I have a big hobby for piano and since I live in university most of time, I don’t have much of an opportunity / time to practice or play. When we first got complaints I decided to move the piano as far away as possible from the shared wall and played quietly. They even told us that It was ok to play in the afternoon up to around 6pm. Everything was fine after this, although occasionally they would knock and ask me to stop playing - I would always comply and stop immediately.

71,1ddkmbj,AITA for starting a family feud over double booking my baby's first birthday?,"
My partner and I were planning my son's first birthday, which happens to fall on the Monday after Father's Day.  At a recent family gathering, we asked for scheduling feedback. The family was ambivalent. There was a lot of 'oh we'll make whatever work' and 'well, if we're going to get together anyway, we might as well just have the bday party that day'. So we planned the bday for this coming Father's Day at 1pm. Great! 

Not so fast. 

A couple of weeks later (today), and there is a msg in the family group chat from my sister stating that 'We are planning a Father's Day brunch at our place at 1030am' and asking for RSVPs. After staring at this msg in disbelief for a good minute, I state that as we discussed, we will be hosting baby's bday that afternoon, and we won't be able to do both. 

Partner and I are baffled. Input was sought to avoid this exact scenario; we literally cannot attend their family event because we'll be setting up our family event at another location. 

I wrote to explain that we did the early recon and planning with them so that we could avoid scheduling issues. I tried to highlight that we couldn't attend this if we wanted to, and the whole thing was rather confusing and hurtful. I threw an afterthought message of 'But anyway, what's done is done and there's no fix at this point. If you're coming to the bday party, I guess we'll just see you there'.

Sister says she did not intend to offend or disrespect, but that she always does a Father's Day event, and her kids would be upset if they did not. She says she is sorry if offense was taken & that 'I think we misunderstood each other because i never intended that we weren't celebrating Father's day, just that we could do both.' 

I took issue with that and responded that she misunderstood or didn't communicate, because I specifically sought clearance to plan for this day, and if there was already a plan it should've been communicated then so we could reschedule. I finished this msg asking for accountability. 

At this point my brother says he and his wife are also planning it, and 'sorry if you're offended but NOT sorry that we are planning said brunch'. Sister then says she's fine with her accountability, and again, sorry if I'm upset. She says 'I did not understand that you meant the rest of my day wasn't free to myself'.

Partner says it is just a confusing surprise 'not to be involved in any of the planning' when we tried to preemptively avoid this problem. 

Sister here says that she doesn't see the problem with doing both, so 'I'm a little confused about the drama. No disrespect was intended.'

At this point I kinda blew up & finished with: 'Ignorant. Obtuse. Insensitive. Call it what you will'. 

My brother and sister left the group chat, and i feel like years of growth&connection just got torpedoed.

The family was ambivalent. There was a lot of 'oh we'll make whatever work' and 'well, if we're going to get together anyway, we might as well just have the bday party that day'. So we planned the bday for this coming Father's Day at 1pm. Great! 

Not so fast. 

A couple of weeks later (today), and there is a msg in the family group chat from my sister stating that 'We are planning a Father's Day brunch at our place at 1030am' and asking for RSVPs. After staring at this msg in disbelief for a good minute, I state that as we discussed, we will be hosting baby's bday that afternoon, and we won't be able to do both. 

Partner and I are baffled. Input was sought to avoid this exact scenario; we literally cannot attend their family event because we'll be setting up our family event at another location. 

I wrote to explain that we did the early recon and planning with them so that we could avoid scheduling issues. I tried to highlight that we couldn't attend this if we wanted to, and the whole thing was rather confusing and hurtful. I threw an afterthought message of 'But anyway, what's done is done and there's no fix at this point. If you're coming to the bday party, I guess we'll just see you there'.

Sister says she did not intend to offend or disrespect, but that she always does a Father's Day event, and her kids would be upset if they did not. She says she is sorry if offense was taken & that 'I think we misunderstood each other because i never intended that we weren't celebrating Father's day, just that we could do both.' 

I took issue with that and responded that she misunderstood or didn't communicate, because I specifically sought clearance to plan for this day, and if there was already a plan it should've been communicated then so we could reschedule. I finished this msg asking for accountability. 

At this point my brother says he and his wife are also planning it, and 'sorry if you're offended but NOT sorry that we are planning said brunch'. Sister then says she's fine with her accountability, and again, sorry if I'm upset. She says 'I did not understand that you meant the rest of my day wasn't free to myself'.

Partner says it is just a confusing surprise 'not to be involved in any of the planning' when we tried to preemptively avoid this problem. 

Sister here says that she doesn't see the problem with doing both, so 'I'm a little confused about the drama. No disrespect was intended.'

At this point I kinda blew up & finished with: 'Ignorant. Obtuse. Insensitive. Call it what you will'. 

My brother and sister left the group chat, and i feel like years of growth&connection just got torpedoed.

72,1ddkkxg,AITAH for blocking a friend after arguing over her finding another friend's address,"I'm in a group chat with nine other friends from school on Discord and we were talking as usual until one of my friends, Maria, asked me if I wanted another friend (Aliyah)'s address (as a joke).

Before this, Aliyah made it clear that she didn't want Maria to find her address as well as share it with other people. Aliyah is also more sensitive than everyone else in the group chat and Maria also has a reputation for finding other people's addresses.

Apparently, Maria also joked around beforehand and ""sent"" it to another friend (named Caroline) and they both pretended that Caroline knew as well. Aliyah didn't like Maria finding her address after she repeatedly told them not to as well as sharing it with others.

I argued with Maria saying that she should've been more considerate of Aliyah's feelings after she told her over and over to not find it. Not only that, Caroline was on Maria's side and said that it was all a joke and that they were better than that. They were also saying how other people also cared about their addresses when Maria was looking for them as well (Maria also knows Caroline's address yet she didn't seem to care as much about her address being known to Maria.) Maria also barely showed any remorse or guilt for upsetting Aliyah throughout the whole argument.

I got really pissed at the moment and said some not great things that I regret saying to her. I also blocked Maria and left the group chat to let me cool down and relax. I kinda felt a little shitty since I could've reasoned with her for why her behavior wasn't unacceptable or tried to see her perspective instead of just blocking her entirely.

73,1ddkeeg,AITA for wanting my fiance's niece to be the flower girl than my father's AP daughter?,"I(28F) and my fiance(27M) are planning on getting married in October. We have the dream place that we have always wanted and have most of the planning completed. My father had an affair with his now wife. She has two kids from a previous relationship(6F,8M). My mother did remarry to my step-father, who I have a very close relationship with. My father offered to pay a signifciant amount of money for the wedding and wanted to walk me down the aisle. I told him that I only wanted my step-father to walk me down. He was heartbroken, but understood why I made my choice.

The bigger issue came up when my fiance and I decided to ask my his brother if his daughter(5F) could be the flower girl and she was very excited. I have no contact with my father's wife, so it took me by surprise when she sent me a long text message wanting to know if her daughter could be the flower girl as my father put a ton of money into the wedding. I told her that we had already asked my fiance's niece to be flower girl. His wife started sending me hateful text messages on how I am being ungrateful and this is the least I could do for my father. I told her that I would happily return the money that he gave me for the wedding. She sent me a few more messages calling me an AH and I had enough and blocked her. 

My father did reach out and thinks that I should compromise to keep the peace and let the daughter walk with fiance's niece. I told him that I was over all this stress and if this continued, then they would be uninvited to the wedding. I have been receiving calls and texts from my father's side of the family calling me an AH.

74,1ddkcuu,AITA for referring to my friend's girlfriend as a 'problem'?,"Basically, I, 18M, have a friend, Jacob, 19M, who has a super clingy, somewhat insecure girlfriend, Layla, 22F. Layla has a tendency to magically appear at pretty much any outing where Jacob is present, to the point where Jacob, who isabout as proficient with technology as my 80 year old great-grandpa, asked me to check his phone for any 'find my phone' feature. 

I have a tendency to ignore Layla, and view her essentially as a 'not my circus, not my monkeys' kind of way. Sure she can be a little grating at times, but thats none of my business, she is not my friend, Jacob is and its his decision who he chooses to keep around. 

The other day, Jacob showed up at my dorm and asked me if he could sleep there. I agreed, and didn't ask any questions, cause I like to keep my nose out of other people's shit. Jacob didn't elaborate on why he was there, but we had some sandwiches and he was getting changed when I heard knocking at my door.

This is the point where I might have been TA, I already knew she was at the door. She told me to tell her where Jacob was, and I told her he was in my room, as she'd likely figured. She tried to get in and I told her fuck no, and told her rather rudely to scram, because she was not my problem to deal with, Jacob was. 

She called me an asshole and left, and I went to sleep. Jacob's in class now and avoiding Layla. I told this story to one of my other friends, and she told me I escalated the conflict, and probably created a mess in Jacob's relationship, since now Layla probably felt like she was a problem to Jacob as well.

75,1ddk5r7,AITA if I dont want to pay for husbands law school,"Okay to start off, I am 28(f) and my husband is 38(m). He's been jobless for a few months but just landed a 6 figure job in Missouri. Our plan has been for me to finish school (2 more years of my engineering degree - currently doing.) work in the field for a couple years then try for a baby. Well, I ended up getting pregnant a few months ago and in the end, we decided to keep the baby. Our decision was that I would stay home with the baby during the day (not work) and take a couple night classes a week to finish my degree.

My husband has always been encouraging about me finishing school, but now wants to go to law school out of nowhere. Mind you, he already has 40k in student loans, a home foreclosure, a recent eviction, and bad credit. We are living with my parents right now until the move because of the eviction. He moved into a very expensive apartment and spent every dollar he earned. I had to cover everything when he lost his job and it was WAY out of my budget. I didn't pay rent when I first moved in. I always offered, but he always insisted I focus on school. Our new apartment will have to be in my name. On top of that, now he wants to randomly go to law school in the middle of all of this?!

I still have my FAFSA to pay for school and currently work as a server. He will be paying the rent while I'm pregnant and can't work - well some of my financial aide will go to expenses. Maybe I'm being selfish, but it seems unfair of him to spring this lawyer dream on me out of nowhere. Especially while newly pregnant. He wants to do it soon because he feels old (38) but our next couple of years are going to be financially stressful enough. We have been through A LOT financially and all of it due to his irresponsible spending. He is filing for bankruptcy soon but still hasnt yet due to money issues. I also don't see how he is going to have time for a newborn, law school, and his new job. I don't want to be a stay at home mom forever (nothing wrong with it, just excited to use my degree, get out of serving and also chip away at his debt).

It feels unfair for him to add more financial stress when he caused the issue we are currently in. Our kid will be around 3 when I plan to rejoin the workforce so I also feel like I'm making career sacrifices by taking less classes per semester and postponing internships to stay home with the baby. I just feel like an asshole for dissuading him from becoming a lawyer because he has always been supportive of my schooling and swears this is what he wants to do with his life.

He thinks it's unfair for him to support me through school and for me to not do the same for him. FAFSA is paying for my school. We would be paying for his. It's just so annoying because we randomly get hit with a baby while I'm the only one working, he finally gets a good paying job after us struggling for MONTHS so I thought we'd be able to catch up and breathe, but then he pulls this out of nowhere?!

76,1ddjz6b,AITA for inviting all but one girl to my daughter's birthday?,"I \[31F\] have a daughter, Mary \[9F\]. She is quite popular and is friends with all of the other children in her class. My daughter is turning 10 this weekend, and wanted to have a party with all of the children in her class at a local kid's venue, as she has had in previous years. However, she didn't want to invite a girl called Ella \[9F\].

Last year, Ella (who was new to the class) was invited to her Birthday party. Ella is a lovely girl, and her and my daughter actually get along really well, the real issue is the girl's mother. During the last party, Ella fell over and grazed her knee, she cried a little but I put a plaster on it and she was back to playing in no time. However, when Ella's mum came to collect her after the party and I explained what happened, she lost it. Her daughter was trying to say it was fine, but she cursed me and multiple parents out in front of the children and tried to complain to the school.

As close and my daughter and Ella are, Mary is now scared of Ella's mum and is worried that the same thing will happen again if Ella is invited. When I sent out invites this Monday, I did so privately to that Ella wouldn't find out, and I told everyone to please not mention it to everyone saying that I wanted something smaller this year. However I received a message from Ella's mother in which she was very angry and very rude. She called me a narcissistic bully and even suggested that the fact her daughter wasn't invited was racially motivated.

I messaged back and explained it was because of what happened last year, however she kept on insisting that was my fault. She sent me another message today saying that she has mental health problems and can't control herself sometimes, and asking for a second chance, but I said no and asked her not to contact me unless she really needed to.

I ended up doing it this evening however Ella's mother unfortunately refused and ending up being very rude again, I have decided it is best if I avoid talking with her for everyone's sake.*

I’m going on maternity leave next month and my friend has no idea how she is getting to and from work. She’s been trying to figure it out since I found out I was pregnant but she cannot drive, there are no driving schools nearby, the closest one is 2 hours away, and they have no family to help them.

I said I wish I could help more, but giving her rides while I’m on maternity leave but driving with a newborn at 6 am just isn’t happening.

She made a joke saying that he should because it’s his fault that I have to go out of work because he got me pregnant and as a friend she would appreciate the favor. I said I wish we could help but I’m not asking him.

She’s upset with me because I won’t even ask, but I already know my partner will say yes because he has people pleaser tendencies so im making the decision for him. Then she brought up how she wouldn’t have taken the job that I helped her get if she knew we wouldn’t be able to carpool anymore, she figured it out when I couldn’t give her rides due to illness or appointments, but now  I feel like she’s trying to guilt me and keeps insisting I just ask and won’t drop it.

Then she brought up how she wouldn’t have taken the job that I helped her get if she knew we wouldn’t be able to carpool anymore, she figured it out when I couldn’t give her rides due to illness or appointments, but now  I feel like she’s trying to guilt me and keeps insisting I just ask and won’t drop it.

I paid it as soon as they told us to my friend on the other hand, was trying to ask her mom over and over for the money after a few months when we were about to go on the first trip that we had I paid for her trip. Of course she was ecstatic and told her mother, her mother cussed me out and told me never to talk to her kid again. She said that I had taken away one of her responsibilities as a parent. She also claimed that if I ever went near her or her kids, but she was going to sue me.

80,1ddivdu,WIBTA for asking my dad to not attend my graduation?,"Hi, I(17F) will be graduating high school this week. Graduation isn't a huge deal in the country that I'm from (we don't have any ceremony), but my family moved to America 2 years ago and I was excited to have a big American graduation.

The thing is, my sister (10F) has a dance recital the day AFTER my graduation. So the dress rehearsal is on the same day as my graduation. My dad plans to leave halfway through the graduation to take her to the rehearsal.

I know that it's not a very competitive dance class, as it only meets once a week, and my sister missed weeks because she lost her ballet shoes one time, so I'm sure that missing a rehearsal isn't that big a deal. I know it's a dress rehearsal but it still feels pretty bad that it's being prioritised the way it is when it's my one and only highschool graduation. She's had dance recitals in the past and will have more in the future, so I don't think that it's as important as my graduation.

Nobody else in our family would be able to take her to the recital because we don't have many family members living near us, and the only 3 people who do will be at my graduation.

I told one of my friends about it at school today and she said that it's awful that my dad is taking her to that instead of staying the duration of the graduation, and she said that it's going to annoying if he gets up to leave in the middle of it and said that I should say ""if it's not important enough to stay for, you shouldn't come at all"".

81,1ddis0k,AITA for not telling my friend/roommate when her final paper is due?,"So my friend, I'll call Sam, and I are currently in our university finals week of this school year, and there is one class we share. In this class, Sam is convinced the professor dislikes her and is marking her down on her other classwork because of his bias (I don't know if this is true). Our final was a minimum 2,100 word essay utilizing the papers and resources discussed throughout the semester, so it isn't supposed to be a drawn out research paper with tons of outside sources. We were told about this paper at the beginning of the semester and were advised by the instructor to start it last week because no late submission would be accepted. 

I write down the due dates of all of my projects and essays one day early as a way to trick myself into not turning any in late (sometimes it works), and Sam knows this. This has caused Sam to not ask me when things are due because she says she works best under a time crunch, and I'll usually give her a different day.

While I was working on my essay four days ago, I asked Sam, who was watching a show, if she was going to work on hers. She told me she would start it later and that she would be fine, so I let it go. The following day I was working on my essay, and I would ask her about her essay, but eventually, she got fed up with my ""nagging"" and told me to stop asking her about it. 

I completed my essay by the deadline I had given myself, June 9th at 11:59 pm, and turned it in. During all of our other projects for the class, the deadline was 11:59 pm on the due date; however, apparently, for the final, the due date was 11:00 am on June 10th. Sam had planned on cramming her paper during the 10th, but since she is a late sleeper, she didn't wake up until well past 11:00 am, causing her to miss the turn-in time. When she woke up she realized that she had missed the time and got super upset. The final essay is worth 25% of our total grade, and since it will be going in as a zero she will likely either fail or barely pass the class because of her current grade. She asked me if I knew about the 11:00 am deadline and I told her that I had forgotten about it, but she didn't believe me. She told me that it was my fault that she was going to fail and that I should have told her the turn-in time because the professor would have found any excuse to knock down her grade.

In fairness, the turn-in time is explicitly stated in the Word doc instructions document the professor shared, but I had changed the due date and time on my copy as soon as I got it. On our University's classes website (We don't use Canvas, but something similar), you can find the time the submission page closes, so I could have found the official turn it time and told her.

My closest friend, 30F, has always been overweight and comfortable in her body and I’ve always supported her and agree with her how different she can be treated, especially in the medical world. For many of her health issues losing weight was brought up which always sounded like such bull to me, examples such as losing weight to help with a sore throat or cough. Her weight never really affected our friendship or the way I look at her.

The only reason I'm even thinking this way is because she was in a pretty bad accident a few months back and got knocked around. She's now in PT multiple times a week as they try to assist with pain management. She’s had other close friends bring up losing weight for her health in the past which never went over well. I agree with her that a low weight doesn’t mean healthy but she is significantly overweight and with the accident I’m concerned about her health and movement long term.

83,1ddi5se,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her “boy best friend” has a crush on her,"So basically from the title it might sound bad but there is some context required 

So my girlfriend has had this friend we will call Bob since the start of school. Now Bob got rejected by his crush about a month ago but ever since that happened he started to get really close to my girlfriend. Like Bob always is trying to stand next to my girlfriend in like a circle and whenever she asks him to do something he does it. Once she asked him to bring her bag to the other side of the school and he did it.

I thought that it was just a one way thing but then my girlfriend started being weird. About a week ago I went out biking with a group of people and I said maybe she should bike along the way I was going so maybe she’d bump into me but then she texted me saying she was lost but I couldn’t help because I was biking trails so i apologised and said I couldn’t help. The next minute I get a phone call from her and she’s telling me to come meet her which I can’t do but in the backround I hear Bob talking. I got a bit mad and she was just talking to him so I just said can I leave now and she hung up. I thought that she had just bumped into him but apparently she had phone him and told him to go out. 

This next bit requires more context. I was in the school show and during the rehearsals and stuff I got really close with this girl who we can call Betty. Now me and Betty only started to text eachother about a day or two so go while my girlfriend and Bob have been talking for a while. 

Recently me and my girlfriend went out to a city together and afterwards we went back to my house. When we were sitting, my girlfriend started looking on my phone and I saw she was looking through my messages with Betty who I had saved as Lil Sista as a joke because someone said you two could be siblings and we thought it was funny. While she was looking through our messages I looked on her phone to her messages to Bob. I finally saw what she was messaging him while on call to me. She was calling me a man child and all these horrible names. I couldn’t hold it together so I just showed her and she just gave me the worst apology ever and started saying to forget about it and how I was overthinking it. But today she started making jokes saying that my crush was Betty and saying that really mean stuff about Betty who’s is actually so kind and now she’s mad at me because she was talking to Bob and I started ignoring her.

84,1ddhnbf,AITA for telling my (29M) mom (65F) that she has to work before I give her money? ,"So, there would be like 30 years of context before having the full grasp on this issue.
But I'll try.

I live in Italy.
One of the european countries that has one of the highest average ""out of parents house"" age range.

At 29 years old, I am one of those.
My sister, 25 years old, as well.

The issue is: my mother and our financial situation.

I am not staying at my parent house because I want, but because I still can't move out.
I am planning to in a bit, but I can't right now.
From 19 to 26, I did a lot of intermittent jobs VERY short term in nature, and I couldn't afford to save money. 
During this time, my mother NEVER had a stable job, and also suffered from depression and would always ask money around, external people, friends, sons and daughters, institutions, State money etc. 
When I was young, she would guilt trip me into giving up on the things I wanted to do because ""we are a trio and we are in a dangerous situation"" and so I would give her a lot of the little money I would make and my life would stall so much because she would give the money back in like 5/10 euros every now and again, so I wouldnt be able to do anything. 

So I havent had anything saved up because of my difficulties t find jobs because of my anxiety and depression and dealing with my Moms own depression and anxiety. And she would also ask me or my sister for some of that money so we were always short. All the while, she wouldn't find a stable job and relied on State welfare and friends and my sister, more than me. 

So, right now I am at peace with what my mother is, but I recently told her, when she told me that ""I was the only chance to save the house"", and I actually gave her all rents money, that I would stop help her until she found a job. Then I would put my fair share of money into the house.

She answered ""no one tells me what to do or gives me ultimatums.""

My sister agrees with me on what my mother's faults are, but judges my boundary wrong because she thinks I live and have and effect on expenses so it's wrong to not put money into the house. She thinks that I should still put my share but not all, and if she cannot put her share then that's on her.

So, AITA for telling my mother to go get a job before I put any money on the house?

87,1ddfx45,WIBTA if I became a bridesmaid for a friend after her sister is no longer part of the bridal party?,"Obligatory on mobile. I (27 F) I have a friend L (26 F) who is getting married this summer. For context we knew each other as kids and then reconnected a bit in high school. We were never super close but I’ve kept up a long distance friendship/acquaintanceship for the last 6ish years. We hung out a bit in college but it was a bit weird. 

Her fiancé (29 M), M for clarity, and I dated briefly in high school. We were much closer friends throughout high school and middle school. M was even really good friends with my sister. In my freshman year of college we talked about rekindling a relationship but after a few weeks it was clearly a bad idea so we remained friends. When he started dating L I was very happy for them both. I wasn’t actively in their lives much as I went to separate colleges. It was a bit sad as M became very distant after starting his relationship with L. I was disappointed but happy for the both of them and we all had different career and educational prospects. 

I have known L’s other sister R (26 F) for the same amount of time as her. I was closer with R than L in high school. But, that wasn’t as strong of a relationship either as R was going through a lot of mental health issues that included lying I couldn’t keep up with. I am hoping she’s doing better now. I have not contacted her at all except for meeting up at mutual friends’ events I haven’t actively pursued friendship with her since high school. Context out of the way. 

I was just part of the bridal shower of L and got an email a few days later asking me to be a bridesmaid since she believes her sister hasn’t supported her as well throughout her wedding stuff I guess. I will also add that R was at the bridal shower and everyone seemed happy and fine. 

I think I may be the a hole if I get between two siblings right before a big life event of one getting married.

89,1ddfttf,"AITA For Calling My Friend's Mum Because She Is Living A Real Life ""90 Day Fiance""","So in the last few months my (28F) friend (27F) has gone through a lot of change. 

She broke up with her long time boyfriend and her childhood cat had to be put down after a traumatic case of paralysis. I was there to help her through it and as mean as this sounds, I was looking getting very emotionally drained from constantly supporting her, I love her but it was very mentally taxing.

Three weeks ago she told she was wanting to meet up with a guy. The guy in question was a (20M) who lived 8 hours away, she met him through PlayStation chat. They have been talking for at least 6 months, when they first started talking they both still in relationships. She assured me they were ""just friends"" and only started talking romantically after they had both broken up.

I never liked him, she said that he would prioritise talking to her over his then girlfriend, didn't have a job and just stayed home all day playing PlayStation.

I told her I thought it was a terrible idea as she said she planned for him to come to her house and stay for the weekend, I suggested they meet half way as he lives 8 hours away and she said no 

This was 3 weeks ago, he never left.

She made up stories about him missing the bus and he was going to leave the next day. She got upset and admitted she had been hiding things from me because she knew I wouldnt approve and it was all too quick 

I met him last night and it went as terribly as I expected (yes I only met him last night as I didn't even want to meet him at all).

He is Indian and doesn't speak English very well, he didn't engage with me at all and just sat on his phone watching tiktok. 

Her and I were catching up and I mentioned a recent dating fail and how I was ghosted. He perked up and laughed, he said that he would do that to my friend when they started talking, ""treat em mean, keep em keen"". He said it was fun to manipulate her because he knew she would be ""desperate enough"" to come back to him. I got up and left as I wouldn't have been able to hold back 

She confronted me today and we had a huge fight 

I told her my concerns, that it's a dangerous situation she has gotten herself into. She laughed and said that I'm over reacting, that ""it sounds bad when he says things like that but it's just a joke!""

She told me that she's enjoying it while it lasts because he will probably be deported soon as his visa is about to expire. She said that they were thinking of getting married so he could stay in the country. 

After that I called her mum, who knew nothing about this. My friend usually talks to her mum every day and always speaks highly of the advice she gives her. So I called her as I was concerned because I assumed she knew about this but she didn't and it didn't end well 

My friend has now left me dozens of messages and phone calls cursing me out 

AITA For Calling her mum because she plans to marry a man who is just using and manipulating her ?

Edit: someone called me racist for saying he doesn't speak English well.

The context is he is not from this country, he is here on a visa, she is taking pity on him and invited him to stay with her. Their communication is limited as she doesn't speak his language and his English is limited. They have translated conversations through google translate

90,1ddfoez,AITA Mom's funeral without son,"AITA

My 79yoF mom passed away last Friday after only 3 weeks in the hospital with an untreatable, aggressive, rare leukemia. She was a living saint. My 82yoM elderly father and three adult siblings (56yoF, 55yoM, 53yoM) are rushing through a funeral this Thursday out of convenience as as they pursue quick 'closure' for themselves. 

I have made it very clear that I am absolutely unable to return so rapidly (8hr drive), because I work in healthcare with no coverage and my children are also unable to attend on such short notice.

Yesterday, I discovered my siblings and father did not even tell me about Mom's funeral website or specs so that I could attend remotely. 

My one 55yoM brother offered a second ceremony where I live which my siblings would attend. I tried explaining to them an interment is different from the celebration of life our Mom wished for, and without question Mom would wish for me to attend any funeral of hers.  Further, the animosity they would feel having to drive 8hrs  (no airport nearby) simply on my behalf would only deepen the chasm already created.  Also, any funeral this Thursday or secondary interment would not allow extended family and friends to be present, of which there are many. I also expressed my understanding that cremains often wait months, even longer, before any such funeral, and rushing through her burial within a week of her passing will only deepen and prolong the grieving process.

In case you were wondering, the rationale for them proceeding with Thursday's funeral is indeed simple: a self-indulgent chase to rapidly ""get it over with"" so they can ""have closure and move on"". (The quotes directly relate their words to me)

How can my father and siblings justify moving so quickly so they alone can move on, yet completely disregard me and my children, and the wishes of Mom? I believe they are acting with selfishness and impatience, and I am trying to understand how they could so easily disregard me and my children, who btw have also lost their beloved grandmother. 

I've expressed to my siblings and father how truly sorry i cannot be there, but I'm even more sorry they believe it's ok I'm not, let alone even bother to tell me about my own mother's funeral.

I was also clear that if they could wait two weeks, then I would be able to return with half of my children. Knowing this, they still refuse to wait. 

I'm trying to understand the thought process here by my siblings and father, and I am completely at a loss trying to explain to my children why they won't be able to attend their grandmothers funeral.

Lastly, I am trying to clarify any future boundaries regarding my relationship with my father and siblings, knowing how they are so flippant to disregard me.

91,1ddfk4y,AITA for screaming at my family for arguing with my grandma at my birthday party and ruining it?,"I, 18F, celebrated my 18th birthday last week. My twin sister (also 18F) and I aren’t really keen on birthday parties with our paternal family, because we are always seen as babies. For a bit of context, my father 48M has two brothers, 54M John and 46 Joseph. The issue is my grandmother ,79F. My grandfather died 12 years ago and she’s still not over it. I don’t blame her for missing him, but she has stopped taking care of herself. I don’t mean that she doesn’t shower, or things like that, I am talking about not taking her pills, not checking her blood sugar and blood pressure…etc. 
So, my sister and I celebrated our birthday last Saturday with our family. Our Uncle John came with his wife and youngest daughter ,who is five years older than us, and our uncle Joseph came with his partner Mary( they aren’t married).
Everything was going smoothly until my mother( 46F) went into the kitchen to get the cake ready to sing us happy birthday. At that moment, uncle John noticed that grandma hadn’t taken her pills, so he told her to take them. Grandma refused, and they started arguing. My sister and I were really annoyed, since they only argued on our birthdays (it’s the third year that this happens), so we left the living room, went to our shared bedroom and closed the door. After 20 minutes, our mother entered our bedroom and asked us to please go to the living room so we could blow the candles. My sister and I agreed ( not that we were happy to do it) and while my mother was cutting the cake, my aunt (Uncle John’s wife) said something that was obviously targeted at me and my sister “Well, some people really like to make drama about just a disagreement because of pills”. At this point, I exploded. I started yelling at them that my sister and I were frustrated that they only argue on our birthday,that they can’t keep thinking that we don’t realize when they are arguing and that that’s why we’ve never liked celebrating our birthdays with them. After that, I went to my bedroom again and locked myself until the party ended and everyone left. My parents agree that the discussion was out of place, since it was a reunion to celebrate my sister and I turning legal adults ( I’m from a european country,where the age to become an adult is 18 and not 21), but my uncles are furious at me for screaming at them.I’ve received messages from my cousins saying I overreacted and that I acted like a kid. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: I've been answering some replies and I want to clarify some things. First, English is not my native language, so sorry for some mistakes. Second, I don't want to say that they ONLY argue at my birthday and not the other 364 days of the year, I meant to say that from all the times we get together in a 'mandatory' way(13 birthdays+three days during Christmas) they only argue on the day my sister and I celebrate our birthday. My grandmother lives alone, and she wants to have my father and uncles with her all the time. My father also argues with his brothers because he thinks that they can't continue like that( having to run to her house worried because she doesn't answer the phone to find her calmly watching TV, and my uncle John and my dad are trying to convince uncle Joseph to take grandma to a nursery home.
UPDATE: hey everyone! I've been reading your comments and I've talked to my family. I've apologised for screaming at them, and told them to please don't argue on birthdays again. They've told me that they are sorry and that they will try to not do it again, so i hope this is the end of this. Thank you so much for the advice and recommendations!

92,1ddfijr,AITAH: I want my spouse to help me with household chores ,"To add some backstory-  I’m currently a teacher on summer break while my spouse works year round in an office setting
The school year really burns me out, especially the end of it, and I struggle with overstimulation and such due to neurodivergence. 

I am now on my summer break and my spouse says that the entire house is MY responsibility because I have the time and they don’t because they are still at work

I do not want to spend my whole break playing Cinderella and cleaning the whole time. I need this time and space to refill my cup and care for myself - physically and mentally. 

I don’t think it’s fair to expect me to do 100% of the work just because I am home.

95,1ddf3ox,WIBTA for not allowing my father-in-law to keep a toolbox in my house with a lock to specifically keep me from opening it?,"My wife’s parents live far away but often come to visit. My father-in-law is not a handyman but he likes to do small house projects for my wife when he visits. 

In the past when he visits, he has gotten frustrated by not being able to find my tools like screwdrivers and vicegrips because they were not put back away properly after I used them. This is a very legitimate complaint as I sometimes get very frustrated by myself as well.  I have a bit of attentiveness ADHD and I often lose tools immediately when I put them down after or even during a project. It’s something I try to work on but it’s a constant struggle for me. 

A few weeks back I noticed a new toolbox 🧰 in our basement with a combination lock on it. At first my wife told me it was hers, but later I learned that my FIL had gotten some second-hand tools and sent them to my house so he can work on my wife’s projects.  The lock is there specifically to prevent me from opening the toolbox and using the tools—my wife knows the code (or at least she did at one point, she says that she has forgotten it and I believe her on that point). 

There was never any point where anyone explained to me that he was sending tools and/or that he wanted them to kept for his own use on projects. They just all decided to send this toolbox with a lock to keep me out. 

I should mention that my wife’s parents really love their daughter more than anything in the world and are of the idea that she should make all the decisions and I should just do whatever she tells me. I don’t really begrudge their view but I think this provides some context here. 

My initial response was to joke about it but I am really not comfortable with this. I appreciate his concerns and am comfortable saying that I simply won’t use his tools, even if I can’t find my own.  But having a lock there solely to keep me out of a toolbox in my own home feels very disrespectful.  I’ve expressed these feels but both my mother- and father-in-law have told me to get over it, which I think is not an acceptable response. 

I am trying to avoid a confrontation and/or bad feelings, or to blow this out of proportion. I don’t want him to feel unwelcome or that his handy work isn’t appreciated.  But I feel that this lock has to go—either it needs to be removed or the whole toolbox has to be shipped back to my father-in-law’s house. 

So WIBTA to tell my father-in-law that they can’t keep in my house a toolbox that is locked to specifically keep me out?

97,1ddeer0,AITA for treating my dog like he's my kid?,"I (25 F) live with my boyfriend Michael (31m) and my two dogs. Michael had a dog but it died just before we moved in together, so he's not new to dog ownership. A little while ago, my oldest dog Luis (an 11 yo Bernese Mountain Dog) was diagnosed with cancer and started chemotherapy. I take him weekly to the next town over for chemo and for a while, he was doing okay. I noticed that for 3-5 days after, he would be pretty nauseated and wouldn't eat his dog food, so I started adding boiled chicken and rice to get him to eat. Right after chemo, that's all he'll eat, then I ween him off of it as he starts to feel better until he's back on only kibble. These last couple of rounds have been harder on him, and he doesn't want to eat the kibble a week later, sometimes not even the rice. So I've been feeding him a chicken breast and a cup of rice twice a day. Michael has started making comments about Luis's refusal to eat kibble, things like ""of course he's not going to eat dog food, why would he when he's got chicken every day?""

Lately, Michael has started to help by feeding the dogs in the morning on the weekends so that I can sleep in a little. I came out one morning to find Luis lying on the ground by his totally full bowl and realized Michael hadn't put any of the chicken or rice in with the dog food to try to get him to eat. I asked about it and Michael said something like ""He's not going to ever eat dog food again if you keep feeding him fancy meals like chicken."" So Luis had just not been eating breakfast on the mornings Michael fed him, which he needs to do with his pills.

I tried explaining that the vet said chemo is especially hard on bigger dogs, that Luis only refuses to eat the hard dry kibble when his tummy is upset, and that if chicken and rice are what he'll eat while he's sick, then I'll keep feeding him chicken and rice for as long as he needs it. But Michael works full time while I am using all my savings on going to Nursing school full time and he says that it's expensive, a waste, and that Luis is just manipulating me into feeding him ""good food"" instead of dog food, and if I keep it up, he'll refuse to eat dog food for the rest of his life. I explained that dogs don't have the cognitive functions necessary to manipulate but that didn't help and we just sort of stopped talking about it. 

I'm upset that I feel like I can't trust Michael to feed my dog, and it makes me feel like I'm all alone taking care of Luis. I am also worried that I don't have the right to burden Michael financially when he's the one paying all of our bills and our groceries. If it's my dog, do I need to take on the financial burden of his ""fancy"" food and find some way to make some extra money so I can buy the chicken myself?

100,1dddp7a,AITA Going To Japan Without My Mom,"Throwaway Account. A couple of years ago before the pandemic I(27M) came into a bit of money from an inheritance my father left me (Nothing crazy but a good start) and lived with my mother. My mother fought quite a long legal battle to secure the inheritance and my mother and father weren't together during my lifetime. When I obtained the money I told her I would take her to Japan the following year (2020), I saw this as a thank you for all the years of taking care of me basically as a single mother for most of my life and a goodbye.

As I wanted to move into a new place with my girlfriend(now wife) soon after the trip. However due to travel restrictions the trip was cancelled, I (2021) promised I would take her the following year, which unfortunately didn't end up happening because travel restrictions were still in place for the country I live in.  However 2022 was the year I got engaged and moved in with my fiance. I decided to use the money I would have spent on my mom for the trip to Japan to buy my mom things for her home - new fridge, stove, vacuum cleaner. I got married in 2023 and went to Italy for my honeymoon - my mother constantly brought up Japan  said I rushed into marriage, she fought with me constantly about her she felt unimportant during the wedding, even though she was at a special table, she did a speech and we danced.

Now my fiance has decided to take us to Japan next year and my mom says if I go then she will never speak to me again and that it is so disrespectful to go and that I should go somewhere else otherwise I am ""stealing her dream"" Am I the asshole for going without her?

Some important context I think is relevant:
•I work for my mother's small business for many years earning a meagre salary, I also sometimes buy stock for her business. I also have side hustles which produce an income but this is my everyday job.
•Traveling to Japan was actually not always her dream and as an avid anime and fan of Japanese culture, I can attest to this.
•When she was younger she traveled to many countries - England, Spain, Brazil and others - on her parents' dime.
• I pay for half of a few of her bills as I did when I lived there.
•She often resorts to guilt tripping and very malicious insults when she doesn't get her way - she talks very badly about my wife as well.

I'm not sure what to do as she is the woman who raised me and took care of me my whole life but she seems to want to control my life and doesn't mind belittling me at if it suits her.

She is partially blind and diabetic so she relies on me to give her her medication and be her eyes when needed. I work from home so we are constantly with each other. I do love her but she can be over bearing sometimes. She babies my husband still and she kind of treats me like a child at times.

My husband is going off on a bachelors trip for a week and I wanted her to go to her other son’s house during the same time so I can have some privacy. She doesn’t get along with her other son’s wife, which is why she lives with us. But she is refusing to go spend time with her other son, so I can have some privacy with an empty house. 

Am I the asshole for wanting her to spend a week away so I can enjoy some alone time?

103,1ddddn3,WIBTA for not visiting my father on father's day?,"I apologize for grammar-mistakes, English is a second language.

So, I (29M) became a father last October. During the pregnancy of my GF (34F) we already realized we would do all the parenting alone, together with daycare. We both have (nearly) full-time jobs, and are taking a day of per week to limit day-care costs. The reason why we knew we had to do most parenting on our own and can't rely on family is that during the last year of my studies we moved in together in an apartment in a city 2,5 hours away from my parents (this was close to the university I attended) and we live here for 5 years now. My GF is from another country and her family lives 4 hours away by plane.
My parents and their entire family live within walking distance of each other, and I'm the odd one out (my younger sister bought a house 800 meters from my parents). It's a sour topic for my parents, and every time we meet, they at least mention twice, that 'if we lived closer, they could help'. But we don't, and we both have jobs closeby, and a daycare for our son (8months) of which waiting lists are seriously long (over a year). 
Now to the topic, Fathers Day is coming up this Sunday and I voiced to both my GF ánd my parents that I'd really like to celebrate it with my son, and GF, because it's my first father's day as a father. My mom insists that I should come to visit my father which would mean a 2,5 hour train-ride, alone, while my son and GF stay at home, because of the naptimes of our son. Travelling with an 8-month old anyways is a pain in the ass with feedings and naps. 
I suggested I could come a day before father's day, but they have other plans. I don't want to sacrifice my first father's day by going on a 7-8 hour trip, and barely see my son that day. My parents are visiting us next weekend because of my birthday coming up, and I suggested we'd celebrate father's Day then, at our place, but they think i'm being lazy and inconsiderate for not making the effort to visit them a week before their visit to us.

104,1dddc41,AITA for spending family gatherings on my phone (18F),"Family relations and visiting extended family is a part of my country's culture and religion, that includes first and second uncles, aunts, grandparents and cousins. This is very important to my parents, especially because they are the first child in both families and are expected to provide, my father financially, my mother in planning celebrations and building good relations with each family in the tree.

We visit each family house at least once a month, that's 6 days a month, we also go there during all our holidays, and us as our parents' children are expected to spend no less than 2 weeks there during summer holidays.

I am personally not a fan, none of my family members are around my age range, so I get to pick between either babysitting my cousins or sitting with the adults and awkwardly trying to nod along to their political beliefs. I pick the former most of the time, however when the kids are asleep or with their nannies my mom tells me to join them in the living room, where admittedly 90% of the time I open my phone and read a story or text friends, I am rarely if ever the only one on my phone, and the tv is on 24/7 so most are watching it or talking about something playing on it.

This habit has started a lot of tension with my mother, I've started avoiding her nowadays because I know if we end up in the same room it almost always ends up being about this, my mother explains how this habit is embarrassing us and how I'm isolating myself from my family, she says if it keeps happening she's going to take away my phone, I sometimes try to explain my perspective but the conversation quickly turns into fights and add more tension.

I'm not good in big groups and don't know how to join in, when there's only 2-4 people in the room I don't open my phone and join the conversation of course, I just find these big gatherings exhausting and can't keep up for more than 2 hours, especially when I can't get some time to myself to refresh. I explained this to my mother as “we have different personalities and I'd like some alone time”, she got more bothered by the idea of me hiding away in a room by myself, so I thought using my phone was the lesser of two evils.

I brought this up with my father, he's the peacekeeper in the family, he said he sides with me since he has a similar introverted personality and doesn't see it as embarrassing or disrespectful, from what I know they have had conversations about my habit but I haven't been included in them. My older sister sides with my mother and is similarly bothered by me, she has taken me to the side to talk about this before.

I feel bad, but I can't see myself participating like my sister and mother do without becoming a different person.

There's multiple other reasons I've had issues with these last 5 years I've worked with him but it's a long list. I've talked to HR about it at least 3 times now. 

The main issue now is he told an incredibly homophobic joke to another Co worker. I probably can't repeat it here without this post be taken down.

Unless it's specifically about work I just don't talk to him. He'll ask me how my day is going and I just shrug. He'll ask me about a movie and I just pretend he didn't say anything. Of course he noticed my change of attitude because even if I don't like someone I still enjoy chatting with people. And I still act this way with other Co workers. 

My manager came to me yesterday and told me Dave said I was being hostile to him. She of course knows what he did and while it's up to HR she hopes he get fired.

Eventually, my mom had to quit because the situation couldn't be resolved. I felt bad and wanted to help her. Since I have a good relationship with my boss, I talked to him about my mom looking for a job and asked if he knew of any openings. After discussing it, he agreed to hire her, and she started working as a personal assistant for one of his wealthy clients, with better pay than my job as an Accounts Manager. He provided her with a laptop and let her work office hours 9-17h.
On her first day I was on vacation trying to get internet access from nearby bars to help her with basic tasks like finding places on Google Lens, booking a hotel, finding flights, and making appointments. She panicked and asked for help, but I didn't want to do all of her work because it was my birthday and I was on holiday. I also felt she was capable of handling these tasks given her experience with online shopping, booking tickets, and managing appointments herself.
During her 8-hour shift, she only finished two tasks and sent them to her employer 15 minutes before her shift ended. I told her that although it was her first day, she had all the instructions and couldn't allow herself to do nothing all day. She responded by saying I should have helped her, even though I did, and that I didn't care, and sarcastically told me to enjoy my time in Africa. After a few days, she acted as if nothing had happened, but she continued to overreact and complain about everything at work, even though she should have been happy with the opportunity she got. She takes everything personally, becomes hysterical when things don't go her way, gets annoyed when her boss changes plans and asks her to cancel and book something else.
Instead of going to work 9-17h she goes 8-16h without even asking him for permission. She does so because of the bad transport, however deciding something like that without consulting now our boss I find rude. 
She also allows herself to share opinions to the client and our boss, whether asked or not in not so polite way. She shows when she is annoyed and doesn't like something openly. She says it's different for her because of her age being the same as our boss. To me this is not acceptable and shows me in a bad light too.
I tried talking to her, but that just results in more drama between us  and all I want is peace. I started replying on her messages just to do so, I am not really finding the strength in me to show any interest in her daily work stuff and she can feel that. She is trying to speak with me constantly and tells me everyday about her job, but I just can’t stand it anymore.

My parents to help me from time to time, but they don’t really have a lot of money too, due to their spending habits. I try as much as I can to save money, buy cheap stuff but to still live healthy and cook freshly. I still don’t earn that much money though. 

I notice every once in a while, that my groceries run out faster. I’ve had vanilla extract for my baking (a bigger package, so it costs less in comparison), which was still quite expensive. I had my own baking area in one of the cupboards and especially one of them (M, 22) uses my baking stuff. I realised he used up half of the vanilla extract (which is a lot. you don’t need much. that’s why it’s called extract).
The other day, I bought a net full of lemons and become I cut the net open, someone else apparently did it and took a lemon. 
I don’t really mind when people use my things, but I don’t like it when they waste stuff which is not theirs and which they didn’t pay for. 

I always tell them when they buy things for me that I’ll pay them back and I always do. 

The second problem would be, that I feel like, there’s no space in the kitchen where no one touches my stuff or takes it. Everyone has like this one part of the shelf to stack their groceries and then they also use at least two more other spaces in the kitchen, if not more. This is fine to me, but I tried to have my own baking area (I asked them beforehand if that’s okay, they agreed) and i put my baking stuff in a cupboard (my stuff used up a quarter of the whole cupboard). Then they asked me to put their baking stuff there aswell where i was like? Is there ONE space where i can put MY stuff and not have anyone use it? I agreed with them but only so they can put their things there as well, I did not agree to sharing. 
Now, as I mentioned earlier, they do take my stuff and use it without asking.

After prom we went to our friend’s house to drink, and he had offered to buy everything we needed. This was in early May. After prom I distanced myself from him due to the obvious feelings he had for me that I did not reciprocate, feeling as though cutting him off would be the best option. (That wasn’t the ONLY reason I cut him off he was also a complete weirdo). The night of prom, he asked me to pay him $60 back for everything he bought, which I was fine with doing, even though he did not ask anyone else who was drinking to pay him, just me.

",Asshole,2024-06-11,"AITA if I keep the money I owe my friend I (17F) have been friends with M (17M) for two years and due to us being so close we went to prom with each other— strictly as friends. After prom we went to our friend’s house to drink, and he had offered to buy everything we needed. This was in early May. After prom I distanced myself from him due to the obvious feelings he had for me that I did not reciprocate, feeling as though cutting him off would be the best option. (That wasn’t the ONLY reason I cut him off he was also a complete weirdo). The night of prom, he asked me to pay him $60 back for everything he bought, which I was fine with doing, even though he did not ask anyone else who was drinking to pay him, just me.

111,1ddb8pw,AITA for taking away my brother's plus one and inviting his girlfriend myself?,"I kind of know I am the asshole, but I need to know how bad it was.

My brother is 29 and has been with Lia for about 2 years. We all like her; she is super nice. I am getting married next April and sent an invite to my brother's apartment. We decided to send invites to households and not individuals. For example, our aunt received an invite for her family and not for each individual.

Last Thursday, we met at my parents' place. It was just the core family because of some tax reasons, lol. While there, I asked my brother about Lia's dietary restrictions. I know that she is a vegetarian for health reasons and that she cannot have certain raw vegetables.

He said that she wasn't going to come and that he was taking his girl best friend, Amanda, instead. Now, their relationship is weird af. Amanda has always been stringing my brother along, in my opinion. He always denies having feelings for her, but let's be real here.

Amanda would date other guys, blow off my brother, then when things were on the decline with her partners, she would be attached to him again. Her last boyfriend broke up with her right around the time my brother, his then ex-girlfriend, Amanda, and her ex were supposed to travel to Spain. What did my idiot brother do? Go with Amanda alone because Amanda was uncomfortable with his ex-girlfriend. Obviously, he acted blindsided when his girlfriend broke up with him. I didn't even say anything anymore because it's all so weird.

So, when he said that, I asked if Lia already had other plans. But my brother said that Amanda had asked if she could come because it would be an opportunity to finally see the old gang (we were in the same friend group in high school). I told him that I would have invited Amanda if I wanted her there. Amanda is mean and cold. She always makes disparaging comments about other girls. At every event, around one hour in, she will make some sort of scene that either has her running away crying or sitting mad at a table telling everyone to ""leave her alone"" and then making a cryptic comment about something ""hurting her.""

I told my brother I was revoking his plus one and Amanda was NOT coming to our wedding. He accused me of being misogynistic and bigoted because I don't understand opposite-sex friendships. Which is BS. My husband has a female childhood friend who is his best woman. I love her too and she has been amazing. AND SHE RESPECTS FUCKING BOUNDARIES. She always includes me and made a huge effort when I started dating my fiancé to integrate me into the friend group.

Anyway, I said my decision was final. He could take it or leave it, but I would be inviting Lia myself because I like her. He screamed at me and told me to keep out of his business. I said to get rid of his weird fucking feelings for Amanda.
He is mad at me. My dad said is none of our deal. My mom is furious with my brother. So Aita?


Edit: to answer some questions 

The invite was addressed to the ""smith's."" Funnily enough, Lia had the same last name as us. Granted, we have one of the most common last names.

Yes, they live together.


The tax thing is nothing huge. My parents have a small buisness but are really bad at keeping track of all their receipts. So every month we go and help them. We digitalis the receipts and put them in a bookkeeping software for the accountant

I called her when she was at the hospital with him (they're related) but didn't know because no one told me so. She told him, and i quote, ""Your girlfriend is SO annoying, I told her that we were gonna be here! But she doesn't care"" My boyfriend, R, got annoyed at me for it and didn't talk to me for a week. He came back after completely normal. She also bad mouthed me to my other best friend (let's call her M) thinking she wouldn't tell me. Guess what? she did.

I was upset and quickly called up C to confront her about her bad mouthing me to MY BOYFRIEND. All she did was blame me for it, saying ""Oh well, we were at the hospital it was a bad time to call.""

M confessed she had to pretend to be the girl who he cheated on me with. She was forced to be her. There is a guy named D and she used a photo of the actual guy, (The guy is real, but doesn't know I exist. C was pretending to be him because they used to be friends but stopped talking eventually).

114,1dda5ez,AITA for calling my parents evil?,"I (33m) had a very big fight with my parents over the way they speak to and about my wife Raine (32f). The end result of the fight is I asked them how they could be so evil and told them they should reflect on how heartless they are acting but that would require them to have a heart. Of course that is a very strong stance and calling someone evil is extreme. But they have infuriated me and I don't look at them the same anymore. But I want to know if I went too far.

So background: Raine and I met in college and we started out as friends who fell in love over time (2 years). We got married a year after Raine graduated and we knew we wanted to start a family so we agreed to try before we were 30. We were successful and Raine got pregnant with our daughter Miley.

But we didn't have a happy outcome. When Raine was 8 months pregnant with Miley, her father and brother were involved in a car crash. Raine's brother lived for 8 days after and her father for 9 and on the 10th day our beautiful Miley was stillborn. I struggled to hold it together but Raine's losses were just unbearable. That time of year is always difficult for Raine. Three losses in three days and she found it hard to come back from that. Those losses are still felt very strongly.

Fast forward a few years and Raine is expecting our son. The somewhat difficult part is he is due around that same time. It's somewhat bittersweet because Miley should be excited about a baby brother, my FIL and BIL should be excited about another baby joining the family, but they're not here. This is where my family comes in. My mom told Raine that she can now focus on happiness around that time of the year instead of sadness. I told mom she was being insensitive and my mom said Raine needs to decided this will only be a happy time so our son isn't burdened by the losses. Raine told my mom she would still be happy about our son but there'll always be a sadness about our losses. My dad's response was to say Raine should keep that to herself and act like it was any other time of the year. My mom agreed with him and said all honors to the dead should be kept private. Raine said that's not how grief works and it's not how love works. I told them it wasn't their decision how we honor or remember those we lost and I warned them to be very careful. So my parents decided to go for the worst thing they could say and they told Raine she will be a terrible mother to our son and he deserves better, that he deserves to be more important than loss and grief. I asked Raine to wait for me in the car and it's when the fight with my parents took place. They argued that Raine was being selfish and acting like she was the only person who ever lost anyone. They wanted me to take our (mine and Raine's) son away from her and oh, I still see red when I think about it.

Calling them evil hit a nerve and I was told by my parents and some of my siblings that I took it too far. While I'm not sure there's any coming back from this.

His mum is very kind money wise to her children and has paid large sums of his siblings weddings and would not make a difference here with ours. However I don't want this to be an issue that the day is then planned significantly around her ideas of the perfect wedding and not ours as there has been previous comments about how she doesn't like the colour scheme and how she thinks my engagement ring is tacky (I have a 1.5ct emerald cut Montana sapphire with a diamond paved setting).

In relation to the dance my dad died when I was 5 years old and my grandad who raised me passed away a few years back. My mum and I have discussed a dance (for both of us not him and his mother) and both agreed that it would just seem a bit awkward and we wouldn't really enjoy it so we were going to skip the father/daughter (SHE WOULD BE DANCING WITH ME IN THIS CASE) dance.

Sorry first time using this so didn't think to give details on fiancé (yes I’m definitely the AH for leaving his opinion out of this post) 

He doesn't want a first dance never mind a choreographed dance. He laughed the first time it was mentioned about the mother/son dance and said not a chance but she was insisting on it. He has agreed on a very short 1 minute first dance where the bridal party will join in after a slight sway to our favourite song as dancing in general makes him uncomfortable. I had always stated before the engagement that I didn't like the dances and he had stated that he'd only agree to a very short 1st dance after a number of drinks because he hates them. We've always been on the same page for that.

I will also add that my Fiancé wanted a destination wedding with a small number of guest, which I was quite happy to do as it would be very personal to us.

Which made me so angry I threw my phone at the wall ending the call. But now I am being pressured to allow my brother to stay.

117,1dd9cpe,AITA for asking a dumb question?,"So I have a huge crush on my friend. We aren't officially together and we haven't had that conversation, but he isn't seeing other people (neither am I) and we're just having a good time and it's been a lot of fun and I am really into him. We're both 18.

I should have expected that he had sex before, but he hadn't mentioned it. I asked asked him last night because I was curious and I was super jealous when he said yes.

I asked him who it was with and what happened, and that's when he told me about his ex girlfriend.

He said she was a lot older (and probably had a higher sex drive.) He said it was a good relationship and the sex was fine, at first, but they were fighting a lot and he stopped wanting to have sex with her as much and she would cry and guilt trip him or just insult him until he did it. He said she would always scream at him if he rejected her or cry, so he did just did it but he pretty much felt horrible all the time.

I really appreciated that he told me. I felt like we were really close, though, so I was surprised he didn't tell me before and it took me him this long. But it also made sense that he didn't tell me because it was a sore spot.

I said all the right things, at first. I said I was glad he shared with me and I love that he told me that. But then at the end of the conversation I said I had to ask something, he said go for it.

The thing is I'm a virgin, ok. So I stupidly asked, ""But what was the sex like? Like was it ever good? I mean, it was probably good at some point, right?"" 

He didn't look that thrown off. He said ""when it was consensual it was good, but otherwise definitely not."" 

I sort of left it there. I didn't think about it until I told my best friend about the whole thing because... she is my best friend. But when I told her about the question I asked she kinda freaked? 

She said ""wow, you should not have asked that."" I said he didn't seem that bothered and she said ""yeah, after confiding in you about that, that was not a smart idea.""

118,1dd9azh,WIBTA for forcing a roommate to move out?,"
I bought a home last summer with a family member (we each co-own, though family member does not reside in the home). I live in this 3-bedroom home while attending university and planned to rent out the 2 other bedrooms to help cover costs. Side note: I am not a very confrontational person.

Two friends, Trevor and Franklin, moved in and signed a lease in late summer 2023. We agreed they’d pay rent monthly, split electricity, and my family member and I would cover HOA fees, water, and internet. Although there were occasional arguments between both roommates, things were mostly fine at first.

Both fell behind on rent, but Trevor eventually caught up and all is well with him. Franklin, however, has only paid electricity and $300 towards the $7,000 he now owes in rent. He often donates blood for extra cash, but I believe it mostly goes towards ganja. He’s had multiple jobs up to this point while living there but always blames the establishment for leaving and changing jobs. 

About three weeks ago, I started dating a girl I’d been friends with for some time. I asked Trevor and Franklin if they’d be okay with her coming over. Trevor, who was going to be away, had no issue. Franklin seemed understanding but got upset when he met her, posting cryptic messages on social media. I apologized if their interaction made him uncomfortable, but the next day, he got mad that she was in my room with me, citing discomfort with a stranger in the house. This was ironic since he had previously asked me to stay in my room while he had a girl over, which I did around 8 months ago without complaining.

Franklin demanded that my girlfriend leave by a certain time. I didn’t see his text and took a nap. She left that evening, and I went to my parents’ place. The next weekend, I asked if she could come over again, and both roommates agreed. Trevor wasn’t home again. Everything was fine until the next morning when Franklin texted me, complaining it was his day off and he didn’t want to ""deal with this all day.""

Fed up, I told him he had no right to act this way, especially considering how much he owed in rent. He also said I was only acting this way because we were texting and I was out getting breakfast. He suggested we talk in person and once we did he got mad that I was raising my voice and asked if I “wanted to do something about it,” implying he wanted to fight. I refused to escalate and spent the rest of the day with my girlfriend.

Franklin later texted, claiming he’d been the most supportive friend out of all my friends and that it was insane I’d risk our friendship over a girlfriend. I found this to be a rather manipulative thing of him to say.

121,1dd8o9m,AITA for baking only one flavor of cookies ,"My (22f) brother has 2 nieces from 2 different women: Ann (6) and Zoe (8), never married to any of them. I was away for college but got a job in our hometown so I moved back. After settling in, I offered to help babysit my nieces on Saturday mornings as my brother and the girls' moms work. I have only been babysitting for a month.



The girls are well-behaved and get along. They are both animal lovers so a lot of our activities centered around my pet rabbits and parrot. Last week, however, the girls were watching a program which showed them how to bake cookies. They asked me if they could.



I don't have an oven but I have a small air fryer. I had a pretty good recipe for peanut butter cookies and asked the girls if they would like to make peanut butter cookies and Ann said peanut butter was her favorite but Zoe said she wanted oatmeal cranberry. I asked if they could compromise as it wasn't practical to prepare two types, with the air fryer being small and the amount of time we had left before their moms picked them up, but they insisted that was the flavor they wanted. Neither has food allergy of any kind.



I looked at the time, told Zoe that since Ann and I voted for peanut butter, we would make peanut butter cookies and she could have her flavor next time. Zoe sulked a little but was still involved in cookie making. Then they watched cartoons until their moms came over just as the cookies were finished so I packed them for the girls and they left.



Zoe's mom called me a few days later and said that Zoe told her of what happened and that she felt I was favoring Ann. She said the right thing to do would be telling both girls to wait another week so I could borrow larger baking devices so that I could make the cookies for both girls instead of telling one girl they had to wait while having to watch another girl get exactly what she wanted.

Context, my father was an abusive alcoholic throughout my life, and after being arrested and charged, my family has been NC with him ever since. Before that all came to a head, he kicked me out during a particularly combative period, where both my mother and I were at the mercy of his worst. I swallowed my pride and left, completely unsure of what to do or where I stood. Abusers have this uncanny ability at making you feel guilty for standing up to them.

Unsure of what to do, I called my grandfather(my dad's side) explaining the hell he put us through for years in the hopes that he would condemn his behavior and lend a hand. This is something I struggled explaining to people after the fact, because my father was very good at hiding that side of him. Many people in my life claimed they had no idea we were being abused because he controlled us in various ways - socially and financially - and we were terrified of speaking up.  
  
Instead, I received a tonedeaf justification, using my follies as a hormonal teenager as an excuse. Example? When I was 16, I once called my dad an asshole, or told him to STFU.

126,1dd7s9w,AITAH for not going to a family event?,"\*Throwaway account\* For context: My aunt and her family live 3h away by car and she has been organizing get-togethers for some time now bc my grandmother had breast cancer and wants my mothers side of the family to spend more time together. This time I was invited there to celebrate their baby's first and my mom's birthday. Now I don't hate these people, but let's just say I don't really like my mother's side of the family, they have all hurt me deeply throughout my life. I can spend a couple of days with them, but not the whole weekend. From what I got from mom is that the celebrating was meant to be on friday, but turns out it's actually on saturday and mom would like to stay till sunday. I don't have a car right now so I have to go with her and I don't want to be there so long so I told aunt I'm not coming.

At first she tried to call me, but I didn't answer bc I knew what was coming and I'm at work, but then she messaged me some clearly passive agressive things like ''oh, what can I do, I can't force the importance of my baby's birthday on others'' and ''the main thing is that the person is satisfied with their own decisions''. Then an hour or so later texts me again and it's a whole paragraph about how she doesn't understand how I thought it would be logical to celebrate on friday when we would be arriving at evening and the baby would already be asleep. Well, since we would clearly spend the night, I thought it would be celebrated the next morning or so. She also went on to say multiple times how she isn't mad at me and just sad and how she understands that she can't force people to care and that me ignoring her call and texting her instead shows how I don't find it important. Mind you she doesn't know why I didn't answer she just straight up assumed I don't like her (yes, she also mentioned something like that in her text).

Then when I told her how there is no need to overthink things and that I don't have any problem with spending time with her, but rather just can't mentally spend that much time with my other relatives and that I would have to give up my whole saturday and a lot of money for a bus trip back home she went on complaining how she spends so much time organizing and it's so tiring and time consuming and how she now has to explain to grandma why someone can't come which I totally understand, but woman...no one forces it upon you and I know grandma, she doesn't give a sht if someone can't come ONCE out of the tens of get-togethers.

In my country simple get-togethers and usually birthdays too are super laid back. My aunt takes control even at my grandma's and get's upset when things don't go her way.

She also accused me and some other relatives of losing the importance of family and acts absolutely devastated when people can't sacrifice half or even a whole weekend trip for a birthday.

Some background: I've always been sensitive to how much closeness we lack. When we were much younger, all 6 of us kids (3 and 3) were very close, and I do realize that probably had a lot to do with how much time we spent together. Our families would trade holidays. A life circumstance ended that tradition and things were never the same. There was no bad blood that led to the tradition ending, it just had to. Not something we could control. For a long time, I resented the circumstance and blamed it for us not being closer. Now, I acknowledge that the distance certainly did not help (we live 6/7 hours away by car), but it can't be the only thing to blame. People try if they want to, and they don't want to. 

I initiate contact. Over the years, I would try really hard to keep in contact with my godsiblings, especially Em as we're age mates, and they would very rarely respond. We'd exchange birthday messages, maybe, but that was pretty much it. If we didn't see each other, which was the reality, we just wouldn't talk. When we finally did see each other, it was nice but then we'd go back to silence for up to years.  

I used to get sad at the end of visits because I didn't want to leave their presence just yet. For the first time, on Sunday as we prepared to drive back home, I was sad simply being there. Being in their presence began to hurt more than not being in their presence. They don't feel like a second family. The title is just a title. It does not represent our relationship, at least to me. I feel foreign when I am there. I don't really know them and they do not know me. 

I don't want distance to spite any of them. I just pour into nothing and I'm tired of begging people for connection.

To preface any of this I have been wanting to leave since I graduated, but false promises, fear of failure, and being trapped have held me back from actually taking this step. I am relatively well behaved, however I do find myself in bad situations from time to time.

Me F(19) was adopted my family when I was 14 years old and lived full time with them starting at age 8/9. I used to have a really good relationship with my mother until I came out as gay to her. Ever since she has never been able to fully accept me. I am fully aware that she loves me, she just doesn’t like me. Through the years I have maintained good grades through out high school and was even class president. My mom has always been extreme and fairly hard on me, but I never got in much real trouble. When I was 17, my senior year of high school I threw a party at my house, it blew up and ended up having 200+ teenagers inside my home. It was genuinely an accident that blew out of control. I took fault for it, I know now I could’ve handled it much better. Due to this she drug tested me, which I tested positive for cannabis. She was LIVID. She was set on the fact that I was a drug addict who would turn out just like my (biological) mom and dad. She’s always been very painful with her words and was especially painful this time. My mom handled it by grounding me from school for a week (I stayed up and sat with her every second of the day), took my car away for months, my phone away for about 2 months, I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere for months, rarely even school related events. Anyways I didn’t have any other problems senior year and graduated with honors and spoke at my graduation. Fast forward a few years I’m now going into my third year of college. She has not changed on how she talks about me, still treats me like I’m 16 and is just mean to me. Recently I made another BIG mess up. I won’t go into too much detail but I got a minor in possession and possession of drug paraphernalia ticket. I was planning on keeping it from her because I thought I could hire an attorney myself and get it handled, but after research and having fear set in I reached out for help from my mom. She was the angriest I’ve ever seen her. She’s back on calling me a drug addict, I’m not better than my biological mom, and is forcing me to volunteer at her Catholic Church, selling my car, telling me I won’t be going anywhere til i graduate because “she just needs me to get through school” no one can come over even my girlfriend of 2+ years. And even getting rid of my cat which she knows means the world to me. I know I royally screwed up but she is making my life a living hell. My mom stands by her word so ik what she will do is actually what she says. 

Btw for anyone wondering why I hadn’t left sooner: I was promised a new car if I didn’t go away for college (never got it and turned down acceptance to my dream school for it), I pay for my car but it’s in her name and calls it hers so I have been saving up for a vehicle, and sadly fear I won’t be able to make it.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-11,"AITA for planning to leave my parents house in the middle of the night tonight

131,1dd6vej,AITA for letting my dog out at night?,"Hi,

I have a 2yo pup and a backyard attached to my rental duplex. I'm a night owl, and my dog tends to stay up with me. Her last potty breaks tend to be around 11 pm/midnight in the school year and after midnight in the summer. I've been really ill the last few weeks, so my sleep schedules been super off, and we've gone out a time or two at 2 or 3 the last few nights. My neighbor on the other side is a single mom with a very small, anxious dog who barks ANY time she hears anything from my side. My dog has been struggling with recall, so I've been yell-whispering for her to get in quickly recently, because I know we risk setting off my neighbor's dog when we're out there. She'll also get set off on a fit if she hears my door opening or anything. (I'm working on the recall with my dog in the daytime again)

So tonight, after a 12:15 potty break, I got a really long text from my neighbor, asking me to not let my dog out after 12, because it wakes everyone up with my door ""slamming,"" and the yelling. She's  ""'never had a neighbor do that before since renting and owning at the age of 18, so 18 years."" She says she has to be up at 5:30 and that it's been happening for months. 

I responded that I'll take her out on a leash at night until her recall is better (which may be a while--she found a raccoon a few months ago and has since kind of ignored me the first dozen times I ask at night), and I'll try to be really quiet with the door, but their front door wakes me up every morning. So I don't know how I'll keep my door from waking their dog up.

AITA? I mean, I can't just not let my dog pee, and she's gone inside before when I haven't let her out. And she does kind of insist on it.... I try to make sure she goes out before she barks, because then *their* dog will launch into a barking fit. So is this my problem? She's asked me for advice before about their dog, and I've told them she needs specific training for her anxiety (I'm a former vet tech). She hasn't done that. I also don't complain when they wake me up. Even in the school year, they wake me up an hour or two before I have to be up, and I just roll over. But I also don't want to be a rude neighbor. And now my own anxiety is keeping me up, worried about it.

Update: successfully snuck out of my house twice tonight, once at 10, and once at 1. Felt rather silly doing so, especially when my neighbor had food delivered at midnight... (it was delivered to my house originally and my cameras caught it). But at least I know I'm not the issue.",No A-holes here,2024-06-11,"AITA for letting my dog out at night? Hi,

132,1dd6rnn,AITA for insisting on moving into a certain room in our house.,"I live in a student house. My house mate (‘A’) has the best room in the house, it’s the biggest and has lots of natural light. He’s been in the house the longest and that was his reasoning as to why he had first choice of that room, fair enough. He’s sublet that room for 10 months, while living in another city and rarely visits. He has a job there and is now planning to move in with a friend in this other city. ‘A’ hasn’t signed on for the tenancy next year and barely spends any time in the same city as us, only coming down a few days at a time for major events. So out of me and the 2 other housemates who have been there the longest we all get first choice of our rooms, as is tradition which was set by ‘A’. ‘B’ & ‘C’ said they were happy & not planning on moving. I mention to ‘A’ that it seems in that case I’ll be moving into his room when he moves out. He was incredibly unhappy with that suggestion, saying he thinks a closer friend of his who’s only just moved into the house should get that room. I had a bit of a ‘sorry nothing you can do I’m moving in there’ sort of attitude. The very next day, ‘A’ and ‘B’ announce a new plan. ‘A’ is going to pay ‘B’ £100 pounds a month to ‘share’ the room and store his stuff in there while ‘B’ lives there. At the time I was saddened by this but it sounded quite reasonable and I didn’t feel I could argue with it. That was about 4-5 months before the tenancy change over. About 2 months before the change over I had a big realisation that just because ‘A’ wants to reserve his room and contribute to the rent of ‘B’ while storing his things there, doesn’t mean that he has any say, as he is officially moving out in terms of the contract. I spoke to ‘B’ and it resulted in a big argument between us. Me and ‘B’ are close friends and I don’t want to fall out with them. My point is that it’s exclusively up to me and ‘B’ who gets that room and should be decided by a coin toss.

‘B’ is planning on subletting his room for 2 months and I know for a fact that ‘A’ isn’t planning on moving in for those two months. ‘B’ insists that he needs that bigger room in order to ‘share’ with ‘A’. However ‘A’ no longer spends any significant time here clearly has no interest in doing so. The main thing I feel bad about is that it feels like I’m taking this £100 a month away from my good friend ‘B’. Part of me wants to back down from this, however I do seriously feel uncomfortable in my room and would be so happy in the other room. Some of our other housemates have told me I should backdown because ‘I should have said it earlier’ or I’m ‘Kicking ‘A’ out of the house’. I think those reasons are invalid but I also don’t feel like I really have everyone’s support. 

Would I be the asshole for not backing down, insisting on the coin flip and, if I win, move into that room? It feels unfair that I feel like I’m creating tension and pushing away mates due to calling out this unorthodox arrangement as unfair.",TL;DR,2024-06-11,"AITA for insisting on moving into a certain room in our house.

About 2 months before the change over I had a big realisation that just because ‘A’ wants to reserve his room and contribute to the rent of ‘B’ while storing his things there, doesn’t mean that he has any say, as he is officially moving out in terms of the contract. I spoke to ‘B’ and it resulted in a big argument between us. Me and ‘B’ are close friends and I don’t want to fall out with them. My point is that it’s exclusively up to me and ‘B’ who gets that room and should be decided by a coin toss.

‘B’ is planning on subletting his room for 2 months and I know for a fact that ‘A’ isn’t planning on moving in for those two months. ‘B’ insists that he needs that bigger room in order to ‘share’ with ‘A’. However ‘A’ no longer spends any significant time here clearly has no interest in doing so. The main thing I feel bad about is that it feels like I’m taking this £100 a month away from my good friend ‘B’. Part of me wants to back down from this, however I do seriously feel uncomfortable in my room and would be so happy in the other room. Some of our other housemates have told me I should backdown because ‘I should have said it earlier’ or I’m ‘Kicking ‘A’ out of the house’. I think those reasons are invalid but I also don’t feel like I really have everyone’s support. 

Would I be the asshole for not backing down, insisting on the coin flip and, if I win, move into that room? It feels unfair that I feel like I’m creating tension and pushing away mates due to calling out this unorthodox arrangement as unfair.",,0.0943164974451065,0,0
133,1dd6lz0,AITA - My roommate wants her red bull case reimbursed. ,"I can’t believe I’m making this post, but it’s just to prove a point. 2 months ago, 4/6 girls on my last lease moved out. I renewed the lease, stayed at the place and am now living with only one girl from the previous lease for the summer. I receive a text from one of the girls who moved out asking me to reimburse her a pack of red bull that she left behind. She said she came back for the red bull pack 2 months later……. I’m definitely not going to reimburse her. You moved out almost two months ago, leave behind a case of red bull and fail to mention it to me, nor did I hear anything of it from the other girl I’m living with (who red bull girl remains in contact with). I ended up having some, or shared it with my boyfriend and friends. If she had said anything about it way earlier on I wouldn’t have touched it, or if I did I maybe would’ve reimbursed her. But it’s been 2 months, you are seriously asking me to reimburse you for a pack of red bull? It’s also not like a personal item or anything, it’s a pack of red bull??? I’d get it if it was maybe alcohol. She moved out, shes not coming back, she should’ve made sure she took everything or said something if it really mattered to her that much. Anyways, AITA???

She often gets upset that we hang out apparently more than I hang out with her which is simply untrue as she sticks to me every second of the day. Until a few months ago, I could put up with this.

Then, one day she caused a massive fight which split my friend group of 8. Most people were comforting her as she was alone in the situation and told them I was leaving her out with Chloe.

Later, my friends learned the truth and are on my side.

She also talked about me behind my back to a girl who told me what she said. She said she hated me and found me so annoying.

She also always gets mad at me when she's in a mood. If she's having a bad day she will always stop talking to me and then later act as if nothing happened. When I ask her about it, she says she doesn't know why, she was just feeling like it.

135,1dd6edf,AITA for not wiping a small amount of grease off the fridge door?,"Last night it was around 10.30pm and I (33M) was in bed but woke up and felt like a snack. My girlfriend (30F) was in the shower. 

Since we had tacos for dinner I made myself a taco with some of the leftovers. I took out the bowl of taco meat from the fridge, assembled the taco, ate it, and then put everything back in the fridge. I guess I didn’t realise that I didn’t wrap up the bowl of taco meat so well and I must have got grease on my fingers, which transferred to the fridge door and shelf. Please note, I didn’t see this at the time but then again I wasn’t necessarily looking.

I went to wash my hands in the bathroom and my girlfriend was still in the bathroom at that time. She asked if I’d had something to eat? I told her yes. She didn’t say anything more, she just kept doing her bedtime routine in the bathroom and I went back to bed. 

My girlfriend then went into the kitchen for a glass of water and noticed orange grease marks on the fridge door handle and the fridge shelf. She was annoyed at me and came into the bedroom to tell me I’d left a mess on the fridge. She asked me to clean it up and said she had already wiped down the surfaces in the kitchen as part of her after-dinner cleaning process (my task after dinner is to vacuum) and she didn’t want to also have to wipe down again because of a mess I’d made. 

So admittedly I was annoyed at having to get out of bed again and I asked her to show me what mess she said I’d made. We went into the kitchen and she showed me where the greasy marks were. I had a look and to my eyes the greasy marks were so small that my first response was to laugh and say I could hardly see anything. 

This made my girlfriend really annoyed and she said it was inconsiderate of me to laugh at what she’d said rather than just grabbing a cloth to wipe the greasy mark. My girlfriend ended up wiping the mark and we went to bed on a somewhat bad note. 

I just think that the “mark” I left was so small that it didn’t actually need to be turned into any kind of deal. My girlfriend on the other hand said that I’d been inconsiderate as I knew she had already cleaned the kitchen for the night, and I should have checked my surroundings after eating to ensure no mess was left. 

I know this sounds somewhat silly, but am I the asshole? Like yes I could have cleaned the small greasy mark but I genuinely did not see it after I ate the taco. I don’t think it needed to have resulted in my girlfriend becoming as annoyed as she did.

137,1dd692a,AITA for moving out of my parents house?,"I (19F) am a nursing student getting ready to move out of my parents house. I am preparing to begin my third semester of nursing school in the fall, I have been working part time throughout the last two semesters as well. I have been taking college courses since I was a sophomore in high school and currently already have an Associate's Degree along with a high school diploma.

I am preparing to move out of my parents house and into an apartment with two trusted and reliable friends. I have planned and budgeted for this. When I leave I'll have to take over car insurance as well as my own phone bill. I've taken into account gas for my vehicle, utilities, internet, groceries, renters insurance, as well as setting aside some of each paycheck to put into my savings account. This is not a rash decision I am making out of anger or spite or a fit of rebellion.

My parents don't believe that. My relationship with my father has been complicated at best. It is a difficult relationship because he has looked down on me and belittled me since I was a kid. I won't go into specifics unless people ask, but to sum it up I've never been good enough and have been actively belittled and looked down upon for no real reason.

I started college last fall as the youngest person in our nursing program. Many of my classmates are 3-10+ years older, despite that I have been able to keep up with them both academically and socially. I have also spoken to some of these classmates about this situation and the consensus has been on my side. Throughout this time I have maintained excellent grades and haven't gotten into any trouble. Despite this my dad still has remained firm in his stance that I'm naive and unprepared for the real world. Because of his tendency to react negatively and yell and belittle I had not involved him in the process of me finding an apartment. Until my mom insisted when I was called by management saying I needed a guarantor. I fully expected it, I'm a 19 year old with no credit or rental history. But now I'm being told I have to do this the ""right way"" and have an adult conversation with both my parents about this.

Ordinarily I'd be all for that except I have not once been spoken to like an adult by my parents. I understand I'm their kid, but I think at this point I've more than proved I deserve to be treated like an adult if they're expecting me to act like one. After a conversation with my mom it's clear that they intend to try to prove I don't know what I'm in for and try to get me to change my mind. It's also clear my mom thinks I'm doing it because I'm angry with my dad, not because I just want the space and freedom to learn how to properly move about the world as an adult. I am not being given that here.

I want to know if I am being childish and bratty with this. Am I overestimating myself?

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for your support and comments. I did wind up sitting down with my parents and we discussed it and there are some things I hadn't taken into account. After discussing we came to an agreement where they'd be willing to ease up on some stuff provided we all communicate properly. I'll also be trying to help more around the house to get a better feel for what goes into taking care of your own place.

“Do you want diamonds or could it be another stone?”

Blue sapphires are my favorite. But I would also accept diamonds, rubies, or emeralds.

“Would you want a lab created stone?” 

I prefer natural but it doesn’t have to be a high carat. I don’t want a big stone. 

“White or yellow gold?” 

Either 

So he came to me today and seemed really vulnerable. He asked me if he could show me the ring he picked out and to give my opinion. He showed me the ring. It was pretty. It was an oval 1.25 carat lab created oval Diamond with a sapphire hidden halo. Again, it was pretty, but not something I would have picked out for myself. I told him so. 

He was really upset. He demanded to know what was wrong with it. I told him that he got the shape right. I liked the oval cut, but would prefer it if it was a smaller natural blue sapphire. My favorite part of the ring he picked was the sapphire halo. He said he really liked this ring and couldn’t afford to get me a real one in anything bigger. I told him I didn’t want anything bigger. I offered a compromise and said if he really had his heart set on this ring, there were smaller .3 carat natural diamonds he could put in the setting for the same price as a lab created 1.25 carat, that I thought was too big anyway. 

He said I deserved something bigger. And then he said that he would be afraid people would judge him if he didn’t get me a larger stone. I told him I don’t care about that.

141,1dd5iat,AITA for heisting my friends dog from my cousins house?,"I (M18) am taking care of my friend George's (M18) dog for the summer and I had to go on a 4-day trip so I asked my cousin Sam (F16) to take care of it while I was gone.

While I was freaking out over this I heard that Sam's family would be leaving for the day to the beach. I got my dad to help me because he has a spare key to their house, so we dodged their cameras and unlocked their house to take the dog back and drove off.

When they came back I got hundreds of texts from Sam and her family to both me and my family. Everyone in my and Sam's family knows the whole story believes that I am an asshole over this and that I should give the dog back because it is theirs now. My father is defending me but the stress of everyone else is getting to me and I also still need to tell George because of how fast it unraveled.

They are threatening to sue/call the police because of me ""breaking into"" their house.

He decides the night before to invite his child and there mom and step parent, whom he has never met, and has just started talking to within the last 2 weeks to our anniversary bbq.

143,1dd585g,AITA for not apologizing to my mom after a fight?,"Burner account as I am new on reddit and don't really know how this works

Context: I (25F) have moderate to severe ADHD and live with my mom (50F).

Story: Recently, life has had been rough. A dear dog I loved was put down, I have been working 6 days a week with little to no help from coworkers, and recently have been dealing with friends' drama. I have been seeing a therapist regularly and up until last Wednesday, I saw them weekly, now switched to biweekly.

As stated, Ive been working 6 days a week for going on 3 weeks. I haven't felt in tip top mental shape or physical shape for about a week or two now. When I tried to do some self care, my shower handle broke and the water to my house  wouldn't stop running and had to be shut off. In the midst of all this, I panicked. I tend to take my panic out on others and have been working with my therapist to not direct anything on anyone unless it directly affects them. I tried to internalize and get things done as quick as I could. My mom comes my bathroom trying to get the hex key for the handle and says ""Our water bill is going to be so high."" I scoff and say that I am going to our local hardware store to purchase a wider variety of hex keys. Needless to say, we get the water shut off. Being hyper aware of my panic and my embarrassment, I snap at my mom and apologize in a very direct manner, some can take it as aggressive. I start crying because my mother always seems to play the victim when others are around. She ends up telling my step mom and my dad about her troubles at work and how everyone is trying to make her job more difficult and talks about my reaction to the water situation.

Fast forward to yesterday. I show my mom my new gear or Muay Thai and no reaction. A little time passes and I try to show her a funny video about a show we both like, she ignores it. I pay no mind, she's busy brushing the dog. Keep in mind, the water is still shut off from the previous incident and the plumber was coming tomorrow (now today). She tells me to clean my bathroom because it's embarrassing to look at. I get upset and don't speak, trying not to take my emotions out on her. She sees this and says, ""Are you mad at me now because I didn't watch your video?"" I get upset and say ""No, I wasn't upset about that before but now I am upset that you think I'm upset,"" and get up to go to my room. As I'm walking back, she scoffs and says ""Wow, I can never fucking win, can I?"" before I enter my room to sleep.

We haven't spoken since then and we were supposed to attend a funeral today but she left without me and hasn't spoken to me since. I haven't been able to try and apologize or even find a way to speak to her.

144,1dd52wk,AITA for telling my SO he is ungrateful? ,"
I (30F) have a one-year-old daughter with my spouse (30M), who often complains that we don't spend quality time as a family and just pass our daughter to each other instead of all hanging out together. 

For context, he works 12 hr shifts 3-4 days/week, but he's actually out of the house for 14 hours per shift due to traffic and overtime. I work 7 hr shifts M-F. I typically drop off; he picks up our daughter from daycare. We split chores evenly.

Here are the issues: My husband spends time on random things when he gets home. For example, yesterday he cooked fried rice because he didn’t want to eat the already-prepared carne asada, and he only got about 6 hours of sleep, which is his average. 

He often complains about not sleeping enough, but if he used his time more effectively, he could sleep 7 hours. I also offer to pick up our daughter so he can ""sleep in"" a little more. Today, he was already awake by 4:15 PM even though I told him to sleep in until 5 PM, and I picked up our daughter to reduce his stress.

I asked my mom who is visiting for a bit to babysit last Friday so we could have a date night, and we went for dinner and drinks. He wanted to do an escape room too, but I was too exhausted. I compromised by making sure we had intimacy when we got home because I know how much physical touch means to him in terms of love languages.
 

During the week before he leaves to work we usually have dinner together and play with our daughter for a bit, and when it's our daughter's bath time, I get ready for bed (shower, etc).This way, after he leaves and our daughter is put to bed, I can clean up the day's mess and go to bed at a reasonable time because I have to take care of our daughter if she wakes up at night and then go to work the next morning.

Today, my husband complained that I took a 10-minute bathroom break while he bathed our daughter. He asked why I was taking a break during our family time if my mom had already cleaned the kitchen. He thinks I should have waited until after he left and our daughter was asleep. 

I got really upset and told him he was being ungrateful. I was literally JUST using the bathroom. He hasn't thanked me for anything, including doing the mental work of figuring out a babysitter for date night or not having to do chores this week because my mom and I have taken over completely. I'm disappointed, hurt, and in disbelief that he feels I'm not doing enough when it's just life as adults with crazy work schedules. 

When he was leaving to work I said ""get to work safe"" even though I was still upset and he spat ""I hope I crash and die on my way there"" then took off. Wtf?!

We have one more on the lease, MD(19M) but he moved out at the start of the month. Basically, the whole year, I have been the only one to do any cleaning other than putting plates in the sink. I used to share a bathroom with G and he never cleaned the toilet, would throw his dirty clothes on the floor, never took out the bathroom garbage, etc. He also never cleans anything else, all he does is put his dirty dishes in the sink, and load them in to the dishwasher every couple of weeks, then never unload it, proceeding to use the clean dishes out of the dishwasher until someone else unloads them for him when they need to use it. I wash all my dishes by hand, and do all the cleaning. I once made a chore chart, where for that week I: vacuumed, mopped, and cleaned the microwave. G had to clean the counters, MD had to clean the downstairs toilet, and B(18M)( he moved out about 6 months ago) had to do the dishes. all MD did was wipe the toilet seat with a paper towel, and G straight up said no - claiming he ""never used the counters"", and therefore never made a mess, so he shouldn't have to clean them. He will complain to teammates(we were all on a college wrestling team together) that the house is a mess, but that none of it is his fault. Currently he piled dishes in the sink so high that the tower fell and they're on the counter. That was 3 days ago and he  just made a new pile. He also filed up the garbage in the kitchen above the bin so the lid cant close, that was over a week ago, and now instead of taking it out he puts his garbage in grocery bags. I took pictures but don't know if I can post pictures with text. Also, recently we, as a house, decided to break the lease since MD wanted to move out early, but G (the leasee, the rest of us are roommates) didn't submit the form to break the lease for 2 weeks after the initial agreement. This made it so that MD requested off the lease and now he's not required to pay the lease break fee (800 each). G then asked me if I could come up with 500$+ for MD's portion and cleaning fees. When I told him that if he had filed the paperwork when we agreed, that we wouldn't be in this situation. He proceeded to call me a pussy and a bitch. So the question is - WIBTA if I don't clean when I move out and didn't contribute any extra money to cover MD who skipped out, which would then leave him to pay to clean the place since he probably wont do it himself, and also be held responsible for the portion of breaking the lease that MD won't pay

146,1dd51o2,AITA for not including my MIL in my Mother's Day plans? ,"My husband (33M) and I (33F) have been married for almost 10 years. We have two children, ages 6 and 3. 

Prior to having kids, we would celebrate mother's day and father's day separately with our own parents. Since having kids, it has generally been that we celebrate each other in the morning, then do lunch at with his parents and dinner with mine. 

The issues with this is are that I am always the one making plans, figuring out where/what to eat, what time works, presents, flowers, etc. My husband does not organize anything with his parents on his own. It is also exhausting trying to organize the kids for not one but two outings in one day. On top of that, when we are at his parents' house, I am cooking, cleaning, serving, putting things away. It is tiring and I'm so over it.

Back in April, I told my husband all this and said that this year, I would rather have our parents come to our house for dinner. That way everyone can see each other, we don't have to fuss with getting the kids out the door, and we get more time in the morning to enjoy the day to ourselves. I suggested that on mother's day, the men can cook/clean, and on father's day, the women will do the same. 

My husband said that sounded like a great idea and apologized for how tiring these holidays have been until now. He asked if there was anything specific that I wanted to eat, and that was the last I heard about it from him. 

On Mother's day, he asked me when everyone was supposed to be arriving. I told him I had told my parents to come for 5:30. He said ""Okay. What time did you tell my parents to come for?"" I told him I didn't invite his parents. He asked why not, and I said because they're his parents. He didn't invite my parents, so why would I have invited his? He said it was ""implied"" that I would do it because that's how it's been every year, to which I said that he should have been doing it himself all those years. 

He got upset and went back to cooking. After my parents arrived, he excused himself to get changed and asked to talk to me. He told me he was really upset about me ""excluding"" his parents, and I told him he was at fault for them not being there. I said he could call them now and invite them over so he did. 

After dinner, my MIL pulled me aside and asked if she or my FIL had done something to upset me. I said of course not, why would she think that? She said because they were invited so late, she assumed I didn't want them there. I apologized for making her feel like that and explained what happened, and she seemed very relieved. 

I don't think I am in the wrong here, but my husband still maintains that I should have invited his parents or told him to do it.

Although, we had truly hoped to do it amicably during the break. I mean, at the end we all got what we wanted at the end so theres not much to complain about.

148,1dd50sk,AITA for refusing to pick up my (20m) gf (24f) from work unless she leaves an hour early?,"Some context: My girlfriend is getting her car serviced this week so she is unable to drive to and from work. 

So, I leave for my work at about 4:25 in the morning, so I'm unable to drive her (she is getting someone else for that.) However, I'll be available after work. The problem is that I get home from work at around 4pm, so I am usually extremely tired from work (I am an apprentice for a trade). I told her that I can pick her up, but only if she can leave an hour earlier than normal because I don't want to have to chill at home for 40 minutes THEN have to leave and go and get her. She said she will ask her manager, but some of our mutual friends are saying it's an A-hole move, and that if it was THEIR girlfriend they would make the time to pick her up regardless. I told them it's none of their business but I was pretty irritated by their comments. I value my free time a lot because I hate my job.

Because of this I was wondering, AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-11,"AITA for refusing to pick up my (20m) gf (24f) from work unless she leaves an hour early? Some context: My girlfriend is getting her car serviced this week so she is unable to drive to and from work.

149,1dd4z7u,AITA for not confronting my friend?,"Hey everyone,
I have posted this also on r/friendshipadvice but thought I’d post on here just for more opinions :)
Using a throwaway for this one.

Title is not necessarily if I’m the AH but more would I be one in this case.

Currently I (20M) have two good mates (21M and 20M) whom I will use fake names for the sake of privacy, who I’ve known for quite some time.
Brandon who I’ve known since primary school and Lucas who I’ve known since year 7 from our sisters both being friends.
Now somewhat recently there’s been a bit of tension between the two and I don’t know who to side with even if I should. I don’t wanna take sides so I’ll spill what’s happened, but only the important parts or bits I think are the most important to know.

Brandon has an ex who they ended on good terms with, I never got to meet her because it was a short lived relationship, but they’re still friendly with each other even though they don’t talk much. Now Lucas has struggled a fair bit with relationships, he’s often ignored and not really given a chance by many girls and if he is they’re always pretty shitty to him and it really does hurt to hear and see.
Now, Lucas thought he’d try his luck with Brandon’s ex which Brandon didn’t know but he has always made it clear that he’s cool with anyone tryna get with ex’s unless he lets us know otherwise.
The problem is that Lucas, as much as I love him, isn’t the best comedian. He has his moments that leave us gasping for air from the laughter but a lot of the time he’s cracking edgy jokes that don’t have much of a punchline if you know what I mean. He made one of these to Brandon’s ex from a post she made saying that she’s stronger because of one of her abusive ex’s. Lucas replied to said post with something along the lines of “let me guess, Brandon?”
Now Brandon brought this to my attention after his ex sent him a screenshot of the interaction, and to be honest he seemed completely fine and just wanted to know why Lucas said something like that and wanted to ask me what I should do.
I honestly didn’t know so I said to ask him himself and talk it out. Lucas got defensive saying it was just a joke but didn’t give much reason as to why he made such ‘joke’.
Brandon isn’t pissed at all, he’s a very chill guy but Lucas came to me saying he doesn’t take Brandon seriously anymore because of a joke he made. I talked with him not mentioning that I had seen the screenshot and just tried to be civil but now there’s ongoing tension, mainly from Lucas, between the two.
I still hang out with both of them but I don’t know if I should pick a side or not or to tell Lucas what he did was wrong.
I don’t want to not talk to him because I know he’s a great guy but I also don’t agree with the joke he made.

All in all Lucas made a shit joke, got confronted, didn’t like that and now I feel like I’m picking a side.
What do I do?
Am I an AH?

Open to and happy to answer any questions to info I’ve missed or left out.

150,1dd4ypa,WIBTAHif I didn’t bring my mom with me to a concert after I already told her I would?,"So I’m gonna try and keep this as vague as possible, sorry for formatting issues on mobile. 
Me and my mom have always had a rocky relationship to say the least, but after covid she has pretty blatantly picked a favorite between me and my younger sister (about three year age difference). 
She actually just took my sister to a concert of a band we ALL enjoy and have enjoyed together since I was in diapers I wanna say. She didn’t even ask me if I wanted to go too, for reference I have a job and could have bought my own ticket and food and everything. She asked everyone in the house, plus her boyfriend before asking me.
That’s the most recent thing I think, onto the actual problem. I originally bought two tickets to see a huge artist play in our area, and invited her because she is who originally got me into his music through his movies. I thought it would be fun, i even got us memento tickets to remember the show. However as the date to the concert gets closer I started to think on everything she has done, intentionally excluding me from events and outings, disregarding my feelings, making fun of my interests, and recently sending my younger sister to send me shitty text messages threatening to throw my stuff away if I didn’t come clean it up (I had a few bags on the floor, our room is small and there’s not much room to put stuff, also most of the stuff in the floor wasn’t even mine just some clothes and miscellaneous trash) and recently has been refusing to text me (I’m staying somewhere else rn to clear my head up). I know I should try my best to talk with her or work this out but I don’t see a point anymore. I wanted to use this concert as a bonding opportunity for us but now it just feels like I’m wasting money just trying.
When I asked my friend she said I should take someone else with me who would actually appreciate it, and even said she would listen to the artist so she could go. And as much as I would like that I don’t want to hurt my mom’s feelings. No matter how many times my friends tell me that I bought the tickets and can take whoever I want. I don’t know, I’m confused mostly. So WIBTAH? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-11,"WIBTAHif I didn’t bring my mom with me to a concert after I already told her I would?

151,1dd4xb5,AITA for confronting my MIL’s best friend ,"So back story: I work with my MIL's best friend who has twisted my words before to create drama at 45 years old. During a lunch break at work, the friend (let's call her Jill) and I were in the staff lounge and after asking me how my day was going and me replying ""it's alright but i don't feel very good I have a headache my stomach hurts and feel nauseous."" She proceeds to ask me ""are you pregnant"" and I say no i am not as I am on birth control and could feel the pms symptoms starting. She asked ""Are you sure"" and i said ""yes i am sure"" and jokingly added ""but i guess it's always a possibility when in a relationship"". 

Anyways fast forward 3 days. I receive a text from my boyfriend of three years and says his mom asked him when I am taking a pregnancy test because Jill told her i said I am pregnant. I can understand how she may may have twisted my words but even if I was actually pregnant it's none of her business to tell. At least I think. Anyways This led my boyfriend (again of 3 years) to say I better not be pregnant because he 110% does not want a baby with me and it would for sure end our relationship. Keep in mind i have a 5 year old already from a previous relationship. When i explained to him exactly what happened he decided to call me all the names in the book and has ignored me since this conversation (going on 2 days). 

I confronted Jill at work asking why she would twist my words or even say it in the first place because what if my bf and I were trying for a baby and now she has ruined the surprise.

153,1dd4743,AITA for Ignoring a Toxic Friend and Getting Angry for When They Walk Out?,"A former friend of mine (who we'll call Trevor) had recently left the friend group just a few months prior. The reason he gave us as to why he left is that we were all manipulative and toxic. Before he left the friend group I had found out he was talking behind my back to another person we had banned from the friend group (that's a story for a later date). 

I had began distancing myself from Trevor so as to not cause any drama within our shared friend group. However, I couldn't keep from what I found out to myself so I confided in with my best friend ""Ollie"". We discussed Trevor's behavior and began to notice how toxic he had been over the years of our friendship. 

To name a few: when we talk to him about his problem or things that make us uncomfortable that he does to us, he ignores us and gaslights us into believing it is our fault. He took up for a person we had banned from the friend group because of their inappropriate behavior (such with their proshipping/art if that helps with why we banned them). And for when he always made me communicate for him whenever he made a mistake instead of doing it himself. 

I've noticed with the way he would use to treat out shared friends was that he would either belittle them, do things they weren't comfortable/liked, or gaslight them. Trevor has done all these things to me and possibly more. 

The thing is, when he left our group, he had used and coursed another close friend of ours into being his personal messenger instead of talking this out like adults. He had many items of other friends of mine and myself (which I didn't get back anything of mine) of which he needed to return. While doing so, we told him that we wanted our stuff back first due to us knowing his lying behavior. 

When we told him this through the messenger he had threaten to delete a server for which only a few people were deleted from by him. I was one of those people who were deleted from that server, the reason it's so important though was due to all of the shared memories that was put on that server. Such as photos, videos, heartfelt conversations, and many more. 

Trevor said he would delete it unless we gave him back our stuff, but we said he had to add us back onto the server. We came to an agreement and we gave him back his stuff but he never put us back on that server (even though it was dead and we only kept it for memories). 

But the reason I'm speaking up now is that lately I have began to feel guilty even though I feel like I've done nothing wrong and was just trying to get rid of a toxic person.
