0,1dddcvq,AITA for not calling my brothers spouse bhabee,So for context bhabee (I'm not sure of the actual spelling) means sister in law in Hindi. I have three brothers. Two who are older and married and one is younger than me. My oldest brother is married to woman who I call bhabee. My second oldest brother recently got married to his partner of two years. They're nonbinary but a biological woman. I have never called them bhabee because I didn't know if it was disrespectful or not I usually refer to them by their name or I call them doll or something. Yesterday we were all at my parents house for dinner. I was setting the table with my eldest sister in law and I was talking to her about this boy I've been seeing and I assume I was saying bhabee a lot. My brothers spouse asked me what bhabee means and I told them it meant sister in law. They asked me why I don't call them bhabee and I explained my reasoning. They started saying that's bs and saying that I was rude and disrespectful. I really wasn't trying to be. My brother and his spouse left and my brother texted me and told me I was rude to his spouse and accused me of not treating them like family. He said he wouldnt speak to me until I apologize to his spouse. My eldest brother and his wife are on my side but my parents just want to keep the peace and told me I should apologize.

I try to look, but I try more to focus on traffic, especially if I'm changing lanes. On this day, she wanted to show me something and I didn't pay attention to see it because I was changing lanes, which made her say 'Wow, you didn't look at what i show you' angrily, which made me angry and I said, 'Can't you fucking see I'm focusing on driving?', which caused a fight.

On another more recent occasion, I was cooking a stir-fry, and she wanted to show me something on her phone. I managed to look at the first one, but when I had to constantly stir the food, I couldn't look at the second thing she showed me.

2,1dd2w6b,"AITA for giving my nephew an ""extravagant"" birthday gift?","My brother (M47) and his wife (F45) have one son, Ryan (M17). I (M36) am unmarried without children, and Ryan is my parents' only grandchild. My brother and his wife are both public schoolteachers and do alright for themselves but are by no means wealthy. I'm an attorney and am well off but certainty not rich. 

Ryan and I have always been close. I used to have a job that required a great deal of travel, and I've taken him to Japan, Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and many countries in Europe. His parents approved of this as a way to help him expand his horizons and have never objected to me spending money on him before. However, last week he turned 17. For the last decade or so, I've worn a medallion featuring an Ancient Greek coin with the image of Poseidon. Ryan has always thought this was a cool piece - so for his 17th birthday, I gave him a medallion with a coin featuring the image of the god Apollo. For those who haven't brushed up on their ancient mythology, Apollo is the son of Zeus and the nephew of Poseidon. I thought the necklace was a great way to commemorate our relationship - it cost about $1,200. 

But my brother didn't like the gift at all. He told me the necklace was ""extravagant"" and accused me of trying to ""show up"" him and his wife. I pointed out that Ryan got a new set of golf clubs for this 16th birthday and would be getting a car for 18th birthday. Therefore, this necklace wouldn't compete with the other ""big gifts"" he received and would be receiving from his parents. I also reminded my brother that between airfare and hotels, I've spent more than $1,200 on Ryan during some of the trips on which I've taken him. But my brother didn't listen and told me to take the necklace back, saying I didn't need to ""rub \[my\] money in \[his\] face."" I refused, saying that Ryan is old enough to appreciate such things.

I don't think I did anything wrong, but AITA?

3,1dd2oub,AITA for planning to take one sibling out but not the other ,"Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my main 

I (19F) am autistic, I have fairly low support needs however I do require someone to be with me when I go out as I get easily overwhelmed and it's safer for someone to be with me if something were to happen.

One of my special interests is the circus, specifically the one in my town and as I have my own money I've decided that when I get paid at the end of the month I want to book to go, I looked at the ticket prices today and discovered that they offer a carers ticket and the minimum age requirement for that is fourteen meaning that I'd only have to pay for MY ticket rather than paying £19.50 each for myself and my brother (14M) 

My younger sister (13F) overheard me discussing the plans with 14 and she asked if she could join us, I explained to her that as his ticket would be free then I'd only be taking him, i then told her that if she wants ill take her on her own day out either before or after, maybe to the cinema as there's a film she wants to see, she said that I rarely take her out and that it's always him that I take out (she was mostly referencing to when I took him to the amusement park for my birthday but didn't take her as she isn't a  fan of rides) which I do understand but I do also take her out, last month i literally gave her £50 for her birthday, took her shopping, to the arcade and then bought her dinner when we got home.

She is still mad at me and has told our older sister (22F) who is telling me that I'm harsh for not just paying for her ticket as hers would only be about £13 because the kids ticket is obviously cheaper and while yes i can afford the ticket another reason for me taking 14 is the bonus of it being cheaper (+ me needing someone with me for support) 

I genuinely don't know how I am TA considering i have told 13 that I will happily take her out to the movies whenever she wants me to which realistically works out more expensive considering I'd be paying for both our tickets plus popcorn and a slushie for her like i usually do when I take her to the movies.

4,1dd2kzv,AITA for writing a tweet ,"So… bear with me, the story is longer
Me and my best friend from elementary school were close up until a couple of months ago. We always had a pact that he would be my each others MOH/BM
When I got together with my now husband 12 ya, he was immediately informed that my best friend is a guy, he’s one of the ppl I trust most in my life, and he is part of my family (I’ll call him Joe)
When hubbs saw our dynamic he immediately understood our relationship and always treated Joe like a brother.

Fast forward 18 Months ago
Joes daughter was born, everybody including me is excited, he calls me to tell me they are having a christening ceremony and we would be the godparents 
I am excited, buying gifts for my little goddaughter doing everything I can to help.
I noticed our communication drifting, naturally it comes and goes.
Her first birthday came, I know my SIL is pretty particular I just gift card for her bday.
We called them in the evening so my son can sing to her happy birthday, made some small talk and I didn’t hear from him for 4 Months (my son’s birthday) - they congratulated sang, again a little chit chat over and out.
Again months go by without even a text, and I am getting pretty upset at this point.
My mother had surgery, I’ve lost my job I had a pretty hard couple of months.
I tried to write but didn’t hear back.
I asked him what’s wrong 
It turns out - he read a tweet that I wrote about idiots being idiots, and he thought it was about him, and was upset with me because of it. He proceeded to tell my that he only invited me as a godmother to his child only so that we would not drift apart. He said “ You found someone that tolerates you, and you look happy, but I can not teach a grown woman how to behave” 
When I asked how I was selfish he told me that when we called so my son could sing happy birthday, afterwards I started chatting about random happenings from our lives, and taking the shine away from his daughter, and I’ve only sent a gift card instead of sending something material for her.
Another example of my selfishness is that when he called for my son’s birthday I again started talking about the adults afterwards. He proceeded to tell me how I didn’t send them an anniversary gift, or at least a card. His wife was noticing that and she was offended. She is from the south and they were really paying attention to send cards and stuff for everything [even though we haven’t received a txt msg for our anniversary]

He didn’t know a thing that was happening in the last months, but here I was labeled the queen of selfishness, and when I told him what’s up he said we should follow up the next day. That was 4 Months ago. I honestly don’t plan on contacting him, I drifted apart with a chunk of that friend group since it was pretty toxic, but I really thought he was a lifer.
I guess I am the AHole for not having boundaries idk

There are a few people that work there that are not gentle to those who are first learning and my girlfriend is not gentle to those who are can come across as bossy or a little mean. So, I’m afraid drama might come of it, people will know she is my gf because we share the same address one co worker already knows what my girlfriend’s name is and what she looks like. So everyone is going to know. (Also we are both lesbians and there are a lot of co workers who are homophobic. Most don’t know about me, only one.. maybe two. I’m pretty secretive about my private life at work). I’m afraid that in the end, it will make me look bad and will affect my position at the job. I know I shouldn’t say this, but I don’t want to end up getting embarrassed or caught in the mix.

7,1dd2gpi,WIBTA For telling my roommate his girlfriend can't stay?,"I'll start by introducing the characters. Me(20F) and my bf (24M, We'll call him Kevin) have lived together for 2 years and some change since we got together. We moved into a 2BR house, and stayed there for about a year before a friend of Kevin's that we'd been hanging out with for an amount of time asked if he could stay with us until he got back on his feet.  
  
I had my reservations considering he had a pattern of being irresponsible. For instance-- the reason he was even out of a place in the first place is because he broke his lease to go follow a girl he'd just started talking to to another state he had no family or support system in. This was after the girl had already abandoned him in our state with no calls or texts to let him know she'd moved away.

We had initially planned to stay together with him on our couch until our lease was up, and then go our separate ways. Long story short, we decided it would be better financially to move together into a bigger place with him as a roommate. Before we moved, we agreed that we would have no more roommates until we parted ways.

This brings me to my current situation. Roomate (21M, I'll call him Roger) has brought a new visitor into the house very frequently and it's been bothering us. It's not the fact that he has company-- we don't care about visitors on weekends, and that goes for everyone in the house. Nobody has company on a weekday, if at all. And if they are, they are only there for a couple hours.

Not only is his new friend (21F, calling her Stacy) a complete stranger to us, she's pregnant (not by him) and me and the boyfriend are adamantly childfree at the moment. Roger knew her and dated her for one day in high school before deciding she was the one 5 years later (with no prior contact). Her car is always in the way when she comes over (we have a tiny driveway barely large enough for our 2 cars) and as soon as she started coming over, she leaves her stuff around the house as if she's moved in.

Stacy herself is not the problem. She's actually not a bad person, it's just the frequency in which she visits when we placed boundaries with visitors before we even moved in together that has really put a strain on daily activities and house dynamics. Roger insists on bringing her over every day, and even has a baby crib in his room despite being told we don't want another roommate, much less a stranger's baby in the house.

Stacy also technically doesn't have a place to stay (or so I've been told). Roger refuses to go visit her because he doesn't like her roommates. This is where I'm thinking I might be an asshole-- Sure, it's annoying suddenly-- and I mean SUDDENLY-- having a random (to us) pregnant woman damn near move into our house with no discussion beforehand whatsoever, but do we really want to kick a (possibly) homeless pregnant woman to the curb?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-11,"WIBTA For telling my roommate his girlfriend can't stay?

8,1dd2dd3,AITA for Distrusting My Boyfriend’s Travel Plans After His Poor Budgeting Left Us in Debt Last Time?,"I (F, 26) and my boyfriend (M, 25) switched to remote jobs at the same company three years ago. Around that time, he proposed we use our newfound freedom to travel the world since we had no local responsibilities. He was incredibly passionate about it and planned everything, so I followed his lead. For six months, we had amazing experiences.

For context, even though he’s a year younger, he had been living independently for six years while I was still with my family. This trip was my first time so far from home, and I had experiences I never would have had without his initiative. However, the joy didn't last long because we returned home about 1600€ in debt each. He had assured me our salaries would roughly cover the trip, but we ended up short every month, and his spontaneous booking of our return flight added several hundred euros to the cost. It took months to repay the debt, and since then, my trust in his travel planning has been shattered.

I was shocked when he said, “In a few years, we won't think about the money anymore, but the experiences will stay with us forever.” He has a different background, having looked after himself since he was 16 and experienced bigger financial lows and highs. For me, it was my first job, and being in debt for the first time really affected me mentally and scared me a lot.

Since then, I've rejected all his suggestions for longer trips or traveling outside Europe. Today, he approached me again, explaining he now understands how much debt affects me and has a new one-month trip outside Europe in mind. He claimed he would ensure this trip stayed within our budget and emphasized that he wanted me to focus on our fond memories rather than the debt. He listened to my concerns and even reviewed our past finances to find ways to save money this time. He admitted his mistake with the spontaneous return flight booking and promised to book both flights together this time.

Despite his efforts, I didn't want to approve the trip because I’m still disappointed by his previous recklessness. He also seemed to expect gratitude for planning everything during the first trip, which he never received because I was too angry about the aftermath. He appeared very disappointed by my rejection and lack of thanks. He reminded me we were both young and that he had learned a lot about travel planning and my needs, acknowledging how important financial stability is to me compared to him.

His attitude made me angry, and I told him, “I wasn’t just young, I was also stupid. Stupid to blindly trust you.” This hurt him deeply, and he was speechless for a while.

I believe my concerns are valid, as his prioritization of adventure over stable finances still worries me.

9,1dd2cj1,AITA for flipping out on my flatmate-landlord?,"My (F21) flatmate (M34) is also my landlord and we have been living together for 2.5 months.

Recently I have flipped out on him after starting to resent him quickly after probably bottling all my discontent towards certain things. Since he is my landlord, I feel like we don't live on the same terms and he is in more power to set the rules. I also have mixed depression and anxiety disorder which my flatmate is aware of, including how it makes me feel over anxious about a lot of things.

Some things that have led me to flip out:
- he threw out my expired slice of bread ""for my own good"" that I still intended to eat (thus, I took it out of the trash can, he knows I ""trash hunt"" and don't care if something is expired) and my flat box that takes literally 0 space in the storage room, where I don't have any other stuff and there is still some space.
- he leaves his dirty pissed underwear in his laundry basket in the bathroom in plain sight.
- he leaves shit stains in the toilet.
- he makes jokes that he will burst into my room after I told him how I was angry with my previous flatmate who broke into my room after midnight when I was sleeping and was naked.
- he was calling someone today and was cleaning very loudly at 3 AM and didn't understand why I asked him to stop since I couldn't sleep.
- he doesn't understand that I am a girl living with a grown up man and any unnecessary act from his side can make me uncomfortable and I will be ""trapped"" in my own home. He makes fun of me not liking excessive touching after I told him I don't find it funny. He got upset when I told him I have preferred dancing with a ""MILF"" who volunteered to help me with Latin American dancing and I have found it rather arousing, but not dancing with him. He called my gym outfit ""sexy"", which I find to be unnecessary information, and so on. He has recently broken up with his girlfriend, I agreed to live with him since I knew he had a gf and I stated that I had a bf which made me consider him less creepy. It is also very hard to find a decent accomodation in my area so everyone is kind of desperate.

I think I may be an asshole and here may have been a lack of miscommunication from my side and I needed to tell him about my discontent and discomfort about some of his actions right away instead of bottling it up in me since he couldn't have guessed about my feelings.

10,1dd28op,AITA for letting my dad stay with me for an internship?,"For context, I’m a second year college engineering student who received an out of state offer for an internship for this summer. 

At first I was excited about going to the new state, but my dad then said I’m going to be coming with you after talking to my mom. 

Initially, I was upset because I wanted to be fully independent. My dads been working remotely and helping me out with dinner as he said he would so far. But other than that he’s just going to be there. He also helped me drive to this new state as I need a car for this job.

I’m a pretty family oriented person but the problem comes in with my girlfriend. My girlfriend first freaked out when she first heard that my dad will be staying with me during the internship and she asked me to tell my parents “no I want to be independent”. Having Asian parents, I asked but got shut down immediately with them asking what’s wrong if he comes, and “you already stay out of state for college anyways so you can’t expect to stay all alone again”. I genuinely did not have a response nor did I know what to tell my girlfriend. I 100% see their response as possessive but inside I didn’t really know what’s “absolutely insane” about my dad coming over. he’s just going to help me out when he can, other than that he’s basically my roommate. 

She doesn’t have a similar family oriented lifestyle, and usually gets mad at me whenever my parents do something toxic which is understandable, but does that change anything.
Even her mom thinks I’m being “spoonfed” and a “p*ssy”, which is the same things she’s telling me.

It’s been a week into the internship, and my girlfriend still brings up that this is “insane” and told her friends that my dad joining me for this internship out of state, and they also seemed to think it was insane. She calls me a child and less manly repeatedly and idk how to respond. Am I off for thinking this is somewhat normal and doesn’t compromise me being independent for the rest of my life? I genuinely love her to death but idk what to do. She thinks I’m justifying me staying with my dad when I tried telling her that for me, it’s not that big of a deal it’s bc I just grew up that way. But she keeps saying I have the wrong judgement and she’s rethinking her decisions about the relationship based off of my judgement for this situation. She’s said she’s not going to talk to me until the internship ends, and just said “you’re right, enjoy”

Am I the asshole, any advice on what I should say or how I should feel? I really don’t know myself and I can’t stop thinking about it.

11,1dd2215,"AITA for yelling and threatening divorce on my wife after she ditched me, even though we agreed to be partners in an activity together?","I (21f) got angry at my wife (20f) for ditching me with another friend in an extra-curricular orienteering course when we agreed that we would partner together. 

 

Let's call my wife Janessa. Basically, this other girl I'll name Margaret usually hangs out with me and takes me away from my wife. She only takes me and doesn't try to hang out with anyone else. Honestly, it's been annoying, especially since it's obvious she only wants to hang out with me and not my other friends. 

My wife was mad that I kept on ditching her for Margaret- which I didn't want to do; I have a hard time saying no. I told her that I can say no, it's just that Janessa has to back me up and say that I'm team mates with her so I don't look stupid by saying no, making it appear like my wife doesn't love me. She agreed with this, and I thought that we would be fine, but APPARENTLY NOT! 

The next day we went to our course. Margaret came over, asked, and I politely declined. She asked repeatedly, so I looked up to my wife who was talking with Shane and asked her to back me up but instead she walked off. I understand she didn’t hear me, but later when I was standing with Margaret, Janessa was sitting on a bench staring at me. When I went with Margaret, I remember being sad because if she’s not trying to stop me then she doesn’t care that I go with her.  

After an hour of orienteering, I came back to where we were all stationed. I planned on having a civil talk with my wife at home but before leaving, Shane walks up to me and says, “your wifes been complaining about you.” Then pointed towards my wife who was angry. 

I was confused- I believe I did nothing wrong. She started yelling at me in front of everyone. I told her to stop yelling because here wasn’t the time yet she continued. Luckily people were ignoring us so I started yelling back. She said I was the one who left, breaking the promise. I was mad because I was standing there and SHE walked off. She said she didn’t hear me and Im at fault for talking to Margaret in the first place. How am I supposed to tell her no without talking to her? She said it was my fault for not talking loud enough and that if I truly loved her then I would’ve yelled louder. I apologized for not yelling loud enough but said that I wasn’t acting wrong. She continued yelling so I had enough; I threatened divorce. I agree this is uncalled for but for context: when we argue she ALWAYS threatens divorce and claims that she’s right. She always brags about how she’s right and I can’t disagree with her or she’ll start yelling at me.  

Currently we are on break and she is with her parents. We have the same hobbies so we can’t exactly stay away from each other. Shane is great and is kind of a peace maker. We can hang out in our friend group but don’t talk with each other, if we do it’s mostly mean comments. I do admit that I am rude with her when we talk because I seriously can’t with her right now. I believe I’m right but she’s making me think I’m the asshole.

12,1dd1qkm,WIBTAH if I don’t attend my childhood friends wedding?,"Throwaway since my friends know my main. This year three of my childhood friends have/are getting married. I’m extremely excited for them. For backstory, I (30F) have grown up with this group since 3rd grade and we became very close in middle and high school. During college I drifted apart, but reconnected in my mid-20s. We talk in a group chat almost daily, however I’ve only really connected on a one-on-one level with one friend, we’ll call her Emily. 

In October, Emily got married to our other friend Sam and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was overjoyed and took off two weeks of work to attend the out of town bachelor/bachelorette weekend, wedding activities and wedding itself. The wedding was held in our childhood town so I was able to drive there and have another friend watch my dog during that time. Still the trips and excursions were expensive and I had just started a new job and moved to a new state in June.

Now my other friend, we’ll call him Josh is getting married in August across the country (I live on the East Coast of the US). Then another friend, Kevin, is getting married 10 hours away from me in October. As much as I want to attend both, I’m looking at spending around $1.3K - $1.5K for Josh’s wedding and around $750-$900 for Kevin’s. Not including the cost of boarding my dog.

I’ve been saving for both, I started to work at a food delivery service to help, even though I work 40-50hrs a week at a high level job. 

I just found out that Josh has scheduled a bachelor/bachelorette weekend with the entire group this month, except me. He’s invited his other friends as well so it’s not just our group. He messaged me to let me know because he didn’t want me to be upset if I saw the pictures online. I know he doesn’t mean any malice, but it does hurt. I’m not sure I want to spend such a large amount of money to attend this wedding, but I know it will damage my relationship with the entire group.

I feel selfish since I’m not sure I would’ve been able to afford or take off for Josh’s bachelor/bachelorette trip anyway, but it hurts to be excluded then expected to make such an investment for the wedding. Also, to be clear not everyone invited on the trip is in the wedding party.

Also, Kevin invited me to his bachelor/bachelorette weekend in July which I can drive to, is a group cabin and I already have accommodations for my dog. So it wasn’t too expensive. I’m also not in Kevin’s wedding party.

I think I’ll look like an asshole if I attend Kevin’s wedding and not Josh’s. I just don’t know if I can afford both. I also feel unwanted since Josh did not include me in their weekend. He did include Emily, so it’s not a gender issue.

Would I be the asshole if I don’t attend Josh’s wedding and attend Kevin’s?

13,1dd1n38,AITA for not letting extended family stay at my house?,"AITA for refusing to allow extended family stay with me because I felt I was unfairly treated by them in the past? 

I am close with my family and we often vacationed/visited extended family together even as grown adults.  Of 5 siblings, me and my younger sister were both married. Each time we traveled to visit family out of town, my sister and her husband would be provided with a bedroom, while my husband and I were given common areas to sleep.

This wasn’t due to seniority of age or relationship length. I was married one year prior to my sister as well as was in a relationship with my husband for several years longer than she was with her husband. 

This happened approximately 10 times, not all with the same family but with various vacations. Fast forward to today, the extended family that put me in a common room every time I visited is coming in to town and needs a place to stay. I said since my younger sister was always so kindly accommodated by this family member, she should return the favor and let the extended family stay with her. 

All my sisters are saying I’m being an asshole to not make a sacrifice to host, and insane to care where I slept and that my little sister wasn’t given special treatment and I need to get over it. The only reason I’ve ever been given (beyond “I don’t remember”) is that no one liked my sisters husband and they wanted him to stay in a room where they didn’t have to hangout with him. 

To clarify, my younger sister now has five kids and all my siblings think it would be “easier on everyone” if I let the extended family stay at my house and in my bedroom and I just couch surf at my sisters while the extended family was in town. 

I am admittedly against this because I resent this family member for how she treated me like I was less important or deserving of privacy and also I don’t want to give up my house for 2 weeks especially because I work remote 2 days a week. But mostly it’s about the past if I’m being honest. AITA?

14,1dd1kte,AITA for not trying to get into contact with my brothers baby momma for a 2nd time,I 28F have a twin brother. He has 2 baby mommas but I am not close to neither one of them. I have had contact with the 1st baby momma on and off for the last couple of years. They have 1 son who is about to be 5 in about a week. My brother went to jail at the end of January. This isn’t his 1st time but it will be his longest. Now I normally see my nephew through my brother because he lives with me but with him in jail I would have to get ahold of her instead. I didn’t think this would be a problem considering this wouldn’t be the 1st time me and her have had to interact with each other because my brother wasn’t around to be the middle man. I have had her number saved in my phone since they were in a relationship but I didn’t have to message her till October 2022 to let her know that my brother was in jail and that I would be watching my nephew in his stead. We had to keep communicating to set up drop off and pick up times and location. We didn’t have any issues. Now my brother decided to go back to jail at a bad time. I had just gotten a new job so I was working crazy hours and didn’t really have that much time. I did contact her to let her know about my brothers situation. Now I can say that my job took up so much of my time that I didn’t have time to watch my nephew. B4 anyone comes for me she didn’t try to contact me either and she could have. My schedule kinda opened up about a month in a half after my brother went to jail. I tried contacting his 1st baby momma to check up on them and to see if there was any days that she needed me to take my nephew. When I messaged her I didn’t announce who I was because I didn’t think I needed to. Now after the few interactions we’ve had I thought she would at least have my number saved in her phone or our chat history saved so when I messaged her she would no who I was but instead her response was “I’m sorry Idk who this is. Maybe wrong number.” I didn’t respond after this because I feel like she should have known who I was because we’ve messaged back and forth b4. This got me wondering if this was why she hadn’t contacted me since my brother went to jail. And even if she didn’t have my number saved I have my brother’s phone and she could have reached out to me be through there.

15,1dd16wf,WIBTA for attending a company potluck lunch without bringing any food?,"I work as a software developer at a company. I am a junior, level 1 engineer (not sure if that matters). This is my first job out of college and I've been working at this company for 5 months. Normally, I work from home but I've been invited to go to the office tomorrow for a team potluck lunch. I just got the invitation this afternoon for the event tomrrow afternoon.

A lot of people have signed up to bring food already. The only thing I could sign up for is a salad or chips/salsa.

Would I be the asshole if I go to the team potluck/gathering without bringing any food since I received the invitation so late?

For some more info which may or may not matter, I'm planning to quit this job early next month. The salary isn't high. I've secured a new role more aligned to my interests in a new city and with a much higher salary and benefits.
