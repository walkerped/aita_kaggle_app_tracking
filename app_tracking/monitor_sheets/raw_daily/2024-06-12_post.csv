1,1de9r7e,WIBTA for going on my family float trip and making a boundary that my aunt will not float with us.,"As a little backstory, my (24/F) aunt (59/F) has been a pain within my family for many years. Not just to me, but pretty much to everybody. I‚Äôm not going to put the whole story here but to summarize she lived in another state for many years and was pretty succesful working in the travel industry. 

Well she moved back here (my home state) about 10ish years ago to be closer to family and things have just gone down hill. She originally had an apartment but got laid off from her job and had to move in with my grandmother. No judgement for getting laid off at all but after that she basically decided she didn‚Äôt want to work anymore and was just going to live with my grandma.

She has become incredibly argumentative and is very much ‚Äúher way or the highway.‚Äù She‚Äôs overall unpleasant to be around and although I know she has trauma that likely plays a role she refuses to go to therapy. 

Cut to now. This summer is my families yearly float trip/family reunion and I am dreading it. This year my boyfriend (23/M) along with my sibling (19/NB) and their girlfriend (20/F) will be coming to the trip as well and my parents have already stated that they don‚Äôt want to float this year.

My parents aren‚Äôt old but I can see how it just isn‚Äôt as appealing but also my aunt floated with us last year and made the whole thing kind of miserable. About halfway through the trip (which is about 6ish hours) she started complaining about how hot it was, how much her eyes hurt, how worried she was about leaving my grandma back at the hotel (my grandma is a very capable woman for being older, she would call if something was wrong). My boyfriend was also at the float trip last year but we had only been together for about two months at that point and my aunt would touch him on the raft occasionally (not innapropriately but still weird) and it made him uncomfortable.

My aunt had made it clear that she still wants to float this year which leaves me in a predicament because only me, my bf, my sibling and their gf wants to float and so my aunt will obviously ask if she can join us.

I‚Äôm considering basically telling my parents before the trip that me and my sibling and our partners are planning on paying for our own raft so that way there really isn‚Äôt any reason why we can‚Äôt go alone. Neither of me or my siblings partners like my aunt either and would likely be very uncomfortable alone, trapped on a raft with her for 6+ hours.

Not only is my aunt hard to be around but she has also never met my siblings girlfriend in person and I worry things would just become very uncomfortable. My sibling is gay and is also non-binary while I am bi (aunt does not know) but I have a boyfriend and she definitely speaks about our relationships differently. 

I don‚Äôt want to subject anyone to weird comments or hostility on a trip that is supposed to be about having fun and getting tipsy (if you want). 

I‚Äôm honestly wondering 1) how I should bring this up to my parents and 2) is it asshole behavior to not want my aunt to float with us?

4,1ddw03s,AITA for resenting my MIL because of her boyfriend?,"**Throwaway account for privacy reasons**
My (23F) mother-in-law (43F) got engaged out of the blue to this man (41M) that she has known for a couple years. She lives with her mother (70F), and allowed him to move in a couple months ago. A few days after he moved in, they got engaged, and have been together since then. This man, who we‚Äôll call Mark, is a total tool and I immediately got the ick about him the first time I met him. No job, no license, no college or HS diploma, uses her for money‚Ä¶ you get the gist.

Fast forward to present day. My husband (24M), our children, and myself stayed over for the weekend at his grandmother‚Äôs house, to spend time with everyone. TLDR: the weekend was okay? I guess? Spent a lot of time with his grandmother, which was wonderful. However, his mom and her fianc√©e never left their room, unless she had to go to work. This is odd, because she loves seeing our kids and always wants to be around them. And overall, they both were acting very odd; he was very grumpy and snotty, and she was just extremely panicky if she was out of their room for too long.

The last day of our stay, we decided to go to a carnival that was in town. My husband, me, our kids, MIL, and her fianc√©e all decided to go. This is where it gets bad. While driving around to find parking, I was on the phone with her trying to designate where we could go. I make a turn, she follows me, and all hell breaks loose on her end. He starts screaming at her, calling her names, cussing her out, and demands to be let out of the car. I guess she followed my turn and almost got hit by another car, but she didn‚Äôt see the car until she turned (which was an accident). I hang up, and she calls me back moments later, crying her eyes out, followed by telling me all the things he does to her. Gets mad when she is on her phone, doesn‚Äôt like her being out of their room to see anyone, makes her be on the phone with him ALL DAY while she is at work, picks fights over little things‚Ä¶ overall, very toxic!

She goes out and looks for him, shortly after we get back to their house. My husband and I had already talked that we will not allow ourselves or our kids to be around him, due to these behaviors or sudden outbursts he has. Well, unfortunately, she decides to forgive him and they ‚Äútalked it out‚Äù. I‚Äôm beyond upset, and I pack our things together, and we all leave. She asked us if we were okay, and I just say ‚Äúyep‚Äù as we leave.

6,1ddvv02,AITA for pestering my father about why he‚Äôs upset? ,"Hi guys. This is more of a petty post. But yeah. Basically I had completed a workout not too long ago (just walking on a walking pad for 1 hour and a half but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been trying to keep myself to) and decided to just watch AGT with my family. I was pretty zen at that point (probably because I was tired). 

My mother came home and said she wanted to walk, but didn‚Äôt want to do it alone, so I agreed to it. But she wanted to see a singing act first. That ended up delaying by two hours because of a plethora of commercial breaks.  

I (jokingly) said I would just walk around the house in the meantime as I waited for her. My dad decided to respond by yelling ‚ÄúGo lift weights! At me. I‚Äôm sensitive to those kinds of comments as I feel I‚Äôve been getting better about exercising so I didn‚Äôt know how to react except with offense. 

I thought he was yelling at me to do it and it felt like unsolicited advice, so I asked him to kindly not do that. It was a bit of a perceived slight.  

At this point I was being defensive and he told me I needed to work on that which, yeah, fair enough. 

My mother then interjected saying that he was just giving me advice. And that I should know how he speaks having lived with him all these years. So I tried to move past it, and told him thank you for clarifying. 

He also snuck in a little comment about how something was offf with me if I didn‚Äôt know how to interpret his tone because he‚Äôs my father. 

When I tried to ask him a question later he gave me the silent treatment, which pulled me out of any good mood I‚Äôd had before because‚Ä¶ what did I do to deserve silent treatment? 

So I tried asking him what I did and was insistent because I really don‚Äôt like being treated like I did something unforgivable over being offended for less than 10 seconds because of misconstruing. And I was confused why he was adamant about not speaking to me. 

I was so angry at that moment that I was moved to tears and basically probably ruined the mood. My mother was disappointed in me telling me to just let it go and that he had a right to be upset as much as I did.

She wants to have a goodbye dinner and get it done with asap.  There were two weekends that were thrown out as possibilities.  Sort of last minute.  We had some camping planned for both and my son has soccer on one of the weekends (that I didn't think would conflict with the timing of this dinner).  I replied (without consulting my wife) that we would make either weekend work.  My thought was whatever we had going on, a dying woman's last family gathering was more important.

Fast forward... the date and time was picked and the time means my son has to miss his soccer game.  Well my wife was pissed and said I should have ""told my family about his commitments"" so they could schedule around his game.  She doesn't mind that camping will be cancelled.  Just about missing the soccer.

I am dumbfounded by her suggestion.  I didn't think it would conflict but as it turns out the only time of day she isn't debilitated with pain is when the gathering is scheduled for.  But even if I knew that was the case I would not have considered telling my family we can't go then because of his soccer game.

and she replied 'im not coming if he's there'

fast forward to today, im three years sober. lived with my dad ever since the argument, and me and my mom still have an on and off rocky relationship. my current bf of four years proposed about 6 months ago, and we've been trying to get things planned for next summer. we want to make sure we're prepared, which includes our save the dates, best thing is to be early right?

what my mom said has always stuck with me, so i decided to not send her an invite, she has a tendency to be snotty, make petty comments and cause drama, especially  with my dad, and i didnt want a big blow up at my wedding.

she saw my brothers invite and messaged me asking where hers was. i ignored her, and she rang me. i told her i remembered what she said, and she cant come because my dad is coming. she told me not to be ungrateful and that she raised me and she should be invited anyway. i told her im not having her ruin the wedding, and hung up. i feel kind of guilty because she has done a lot for me, but i feel like its a situation where she loves me because im her daughter, but doesnt like me as my own person

11,1dduh20,AITA for reporting another student for racism after he called me a 'Snow bunny'?,"My school has started doing a programme with another school which allows their Sixth Form students to come and study a subject at our school.

I'm not in Sixth Form, I'm 15F, but my Tutor is a Sixth Form teacher so we take Morning registers in her classroom in the Sixth Form block. Other people who go to school in England will know that your Tutor's class is kind of like your base. At least it is in my school. 

Anyway, a group of boys from the other school have come here to study Programming or something idk, but they line up outside my class three mornings a week. Their bus brings them early and so whenever we leave for our classes in the morning, they're all crowding outside our Tutor's classroom.

Since Easter, they've been cat-calling and generally harassing myself and the four other white girls in the class. They're obnoxious anyway with the noise, swearing, loud music on their phones etc as we're still in the classroom so we avoid eye contact, talking or even looking in their direction. But I had enough today and so did my friend.

We were walking past and they started again with the same thing they keep saying, 'need me a snow bunny', 'need to make it snow' and other disgusting things all centred on the phrase 'Snow Bunny'. 

I told my Tutor and said 'I was racially abused and it's been happening for weeks now', she heard me out and agreed it was a disgusting term and so she escalated it to my Head of Year. She heard me out and said it wasn't racist. I disagreed and said they haven't said anything like this to the other girls in the class who are either Punjabi, Chinese or Mixed-race.

She patronised me about American attitudes (I'm American but my parents moved to England for me to attend this school), told me that they're from a different lifestyle because they're from (it's an inner-city place) and I should have 'cultural compassion'. I told her 'I don't know why you're treating them like aliens, aren't manners universal'. She considered that to be disrespectful and called my parents. 

Long story short, my Headteacher has said that the language used was dehumanising and degrading and so the boys will be made to apologise to me. She said if I felt uncomfortable then they will be removed from the school.

My Mom is firmly on my side but my Dad thinks calling it racist is 'an overexaggeration'. I don't think it is but now this evening I've seen a 'bait' page on TikTok for their school posting about me being racist and a white supremacist. I don't think I was being racist and I do want them removed but I also don't want my face and name plastered everywhere online over this.

My friends all agree that they were gross and haven't stopped naturally when we've ignored them so what else could we do? But my classmate who is mixed-race thinks it's a microaggression and we're being 'retaliatory'.

EDIT; so I‚Äôve been compared to the woman who lied about Emmett Till and been accused of lying because no black boy would ever do anything to a white woman. I‚Äôm muting this now.

My uncle is diabetic and needs to measure out his meals. He can‚Äôt eat many things so he has his own foods that only he eats. Otherwise, my aunt and I share the same food in the fridge and she always gets new things to try.

Last night I was making Mac n Cheese (it was really just random pasta with some different cheeses in the fridge) and grabbed some shredded cheese to use. Halfway through adding it, my aunt says that‚Äôs my uncle‚Äôs shredded cheese that he started using for meal prep. I didn‚Äôt finish the bag but I took enough where it would probably not add up to enough ounces for his meals. (About 3 pinches)

We don‚Äôt have the best relationship. He has anger issues and attributes it to work. I don‚Äôt have a job and rely on them for groceries, but I do help around the house and babysit my younger neice. I got the idea to replenish the shredded cheese to avoid any arguments about someone touching his food. I searched around in my room for any spare change or dollars I could find and went to the grocery store to buy another bag of cheese.

When I got back, he was home and asked where I went. I told him I accidentally used some of his cheese and I bought an extra bag. He then starts yelling at me for eating his cheese, that he only has limited things he can eat, why did I eat the one thing he has to flavor his meals, and that I‚Äôm trying to play martyr buying more cheese when I have nothing to spend. 

I tell him I‚Äôm just making up for my mistake and he says to stop playing the hero and that I shouldn‚Äôt have done anything or told him anything. He says if I could buy my own cheese then I should buy my own food instead of eating their‚Äôs.

My aunt assured me he didn‚Äôt mean what he said but that I should‚Äôve just waited for her to replace the cheese instead of ‚Äúcalling attention to yourself‚Äù. She said I was acting dramatic by spending what I had left on his cheese instead of just admitting to him that I took the cheese first.

She automatically tells me that I don‚Äôt care about her, and that ‚Äúpeople only care when you‚Äôre 6 feet under‚Äù. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúyou never loved me, you‚Äôre selfish and only think about yourself. I hope you end up old and alone with your bitter attitude.‚Äù 

This has all been said to me for not answering the first call. 

I haven‚Äôt been the only one to tell my mom to seek out mental help. I know she has some trauma, as a lot has happened to her immediate family and herself (I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, as some of it is very graphic and traumatic). But, at the same time, I don‚Äôt think any of it warrants this reaction to not picking up the phone the first time. 

So, AITA for not responding to my mom‚Äôs calls straight away? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-12,"AITA for not answering phone calls, and telling my mom to get help? I‚Äôll try to keep this as clear as possible. 

My mom (51F) and dad (53M) got divorced last year. I, (23F) and sister (19F) got stuck in the middle quite often. 

Long story short, my dad kept the house. My sister and I still live with dad. Mom lives elsewhere. 

My mom calls nearly daily. Sometimes, I‚Äôm busy after she gets off work (job hunting, out with friends, on a date with boyfriend, etc.) and miss her calls.

17,1ddt8id,AITA for telling my friend shes better off without her ex?,"My friend (37F) recently broke up with her boyfriend of several years and is devastated by it, I am sympathetic to this, but the guy made a list of why he was breaking up with her.

My friend, lets call her Elle, suffers from extreme anxiety and sevre depression. She recently finished 2 years on workers comp for mental injuries sustained at work. During that time she built and moved into her own home. The partner, lets call him Ted, moved in also.

After two years in the newly built home he demanded she move with him to another city 2 hours away from her family and friends, because he hates our country town. She did, giving up her newly built home.

While in the new city she studied for and got a new job, settled into a new home and made new friends. After 8 months in the new city he dumps her. He told her:

She lacks drive. Her mental health issues are all in her head. She doesn't exercise (mind you shes like 80kgs and slim). Her new job doesn't pay enough. Taking time off from work for mental injuries is pathetic.

Now I am aware I may be biased as shes been my friend for 25 years and I always found this guy arrogant.

I've been supportive because of how hurt she is, but I have also told her she is better off without him.

18,1ddt5k7,AITA for refusing to go to my gf's nieces dance recital if i have to sit by myself?,"| [20M] was invited to my gfs [20F] 4yo nieces dance recital. I agreed, it wouldn't be my first time doing things like this with her and i tend to enjoy it. problem is that the venue has assigned seating that you have to pay for, and the available seats are not all together. my gfs family is pretty large and they were able to get seats roughly grouped together, but id have to get a seat away from them or switch with someone who will sit away from everyone instead.

I don't want to sit by myself, it would just be very awkward for me. her niece is only 4 and she probably won't notice me if im not with the rest of her family, and there will be plenty of opportunities later on when she's older. so basically i told my gf that if i have to sit by myself i wont go. my gfs sister (nieces mom) offered to sit by herself so she can get a seat closer to the stage, so in my head everything works out.

but my gf is now upset with me because i didn't accept the initial proposal and my attendance would feel insincere. to her it feels that i dont want to go and im only going because she asked, not because of her niece. i love that kid and i do want to go, but im simply not close enough to her or her family to justify paying money to sit alone when she won't even remember i was there.

i don't understand why she's so upset with me even though we found a solution, but i can understand her perspective and refusing to go if im sitting alone definitely doesn't help my case.
