1,1de9r7e,WIBTA for going on my family float trip and making a boundary that my aunt will not float with us.,"As a little backstory, my (24/F) aunt (59/F) has been a pain within my family for many years. Not just to me, but pretty much to everybody. I‚Äôm not going to put the whole story here but to summarize she lived in another state for many years and was pretty succesful working in the travel industry. 

Well she moved back here (my home state) about 10ish years ago to be closer to family and things have just gone down hill. She originally had an apartment but got laid off from her job and had to move in with my grandmother. No judgement for getting laid off at all but after that she basically decided she didn‚Äôt want to work anymore and was just going to live with my grandma.

She has become incredibly argumentative and is very much ‚Äúher way or the highway.‚Äù She‚Äôs overall unpleasant to be around and although I know she has trauma that likely plays a role she refuses to go to therapy. 

Cut to now. This summer is my families yearly float trip/family reunion and I am dreading it. This year my boyfriend (23/M) along with my sibling (19/NB) and their girlfriend (20/F) will be coming to the trip as well and my parents have already stated that they don‚Äôt want to float this year.

My parents aren‚Äôt old but I can see how it just isn‚Äôt as appealing but also my aunt floated with us last year and made the whole thing kind of miserable. About halfway through the trip (which is about 6ish hours) she started complaining about how hot it was, how much her eyes hurt, how worried she was about leaving my grandma back at the hotel (my grandma is a very capable woman for being older, she would call if something was wrong). My boyfriend was also at the float trip last year but we had only been together for about two months at that point and my aunt would touch him on the raft occasionally (not innapropriately but still weird) and it made him uncomfortable.

My aunt had made it clear that she still wants to float this year which leaves me in a predicament because only me, my bf, my sibling and their gf wants to float and so my aunt will obviously ask if she can join us.

I‚Äôm considering basically telling my parents before the trip that me and my sibling and our partners are planning on paying for our own raft so that way there really isn‚Äôt any reason why we can‚Äôt go alone. Neither of me or my siblings partners like my aunt either and would likely be very uncomfortable alone, trapped on a raft with her for 6+ hours.

Not only is my aunt hard to be around but she has also never met my siblings girlfriend in person and I worry things would just become very uncomfortable. My sibling is gay and is also non-binary while I am bi (aunt does not know) but I have a boyfriend and she definitely speaks about our relationships differently. 

I don‚Äôt want to subject anyone to weird comments or hostility on a trip that is supposed to be about having fun and getting tipsy (if you want). 

I‚Äôm honestly wondering 1) how I should bring this up to my parents and 2) is it asshole behavior to not want my aunt to float with us?

4,1ddw03s,AITA for resenting my MIL because of her boyfriend?,"**Throwaway account for privacy reasons**
My (23F) mother-in-law (43F) got engaged out of the blue to this man (41M) that she has known for a couple years. She lives with her mother (70F), and allowed him to move in a couple months ago. A few days after he moved in, they got engaged, and have been together since then. This man, who we‚Äôll call Mark, is a total tool and I immediately got the ick about him the first time I met him. No job, no license, no college or HS diploma, uses her for money‚Ä¶ you get the gist.

Fast forward to present day. My husband (24M), our children, and myself stayed over for the weekend at his grandmother‚Äôs house, to spend time with everyone. TLDR: the weekend was okay? I guess? Spent a lot of time with his grandmother, which was wonderful. However, his mom and her fianc√©e never left their room, unless she had to go to work. This is odd, because she loves seeing our kids and always wants to be around them. And overall, they both were acting very odd; he was very grumpy and snotty, and she was just extremely panicky if she was out of their room for too long.

The last day of our stay, we decided to go to a carnival that was in town. My husband, me, our kids, MIL, and her fianc√©e all decided to go. This is where it gets bad. While driving around to find parking, I was on the phone with her trying to designate where we could go. I make a turn, she follows me, and all hell breaks loose on her end. He starts screaming at her, calling her names, cussing her out, and demands to be let out of the car. I guess she followed my turn and almost got hit by another car, but she didn‚Äôt see the car until she turned (which was an accident). I hang up, and she calls me back moments later, crying her eyes out, followed by telling me all the things he does to her. Gets mad when she is on her phone, doesn‚Äôt like her being out of their room to see anyone, makes her be on the phone with him ALL DAY while she is at work, picks fights over little things‚Ä¶ overall, very toxic!

She goes out and looks for him, shortly after we get back to their house. My husband and I had already talked that we will not allow ourselves or our kids to be around him, due to these behaviors or sudden outbursts he has. Well, unfortunately, she decides to forgive him and they ‚Äútalked it out‚Äù. I‚Äôm beyond upset, and I pack our things together, and we all leave. She asked us if we were okay, and I just say ‚Äúyep‚Äù as we leave.

6,1ddvv02,AITA for pestering my father about why he‚Äôs upset? ,"Hi guys. This is more of a petty post. But yeah. Basically I had completed a workout not too long ago (just walking on a walking pad for 1 hour and a half but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been trying to keep myself to) and decided to just watch AGT with my family. I was pretty zen at that point (probably because I was tired). 

My mother came home and said she wanted to walk, but didn‚Äôt want to do it alone, so I agreed to it. But she wanted to see a singing act first. That ended up delaying by two hours because of a plethora of commercial breaks.  

I (jokingly) said I would just walk around the house in the meantime as I waited for her. My dad decided to respond by yelling ‚ÄúGo lift weights! At me. I‚Äôm sensitive to those kinds of comments as I feel I‚Äôve been getting better about exercising so I didn‚Äôt know how to react except with offense. 

I thought he was yelling at me to do it and it felt like unsolicited advice, so I asked him to kindly not do that. It was a bit of a perceived slight.  

At this point I was being defensive and he told me I needed to work on that which, yeah, fair enough. 

My mother then interjected saying that he was just giving me advice. And that I should know how he speaks having lived with him all these years. So I tried to move past it, and told him thank you for clarifying. 

He also snuck in a little comment about how something was offf with me if I didn‚Äôt know how to interpret his tone because he‚Äôs my father. 

When I tried to ask him a question later he gave me the silent treatment, which pulled me out of any good mood I‚Äôd had before because‚Ä¶ what did I do to deserve silent treatment? 

So I tried asking him what I did and was insistent because I really don‚Äôt like being treated like I did something unforgivable over being offended for less than 10 seconds because of misconstruing. And I was confused why he was adamant about not speaking to me. 

I was so angry at that moment that I was moved to tears and basically probably ruined the mood. My mother was disappointed in me telling me to just let it go and that he had a right to be upset as much as I did.

She wants to have a goodbye dinner and get it done with asap.  There were two weekends that were thrown out as possibilities.  Sort of last minute.  We had some camping planned for both and my son has soccer on one of the weekends (that I didn't think would conflict with the timing of this dinner).  I replied (without consulting my wife) that we would make either weekend work.  My thought was whatever we had going on, a dying woman's last family gathering was more important.

Fast forward... the date and time was picked and the time means my son has to miss his soccer game.  Well my wife was pissed and said I should have ""told my family about his commitments"" so they could schedule around his game.  She doesn't mind that camping will be cancelled.  Just about missing the soccer.

I am dumbfounded by her suggestion.  I didn't think it would conflict but as it turns out the only time of day she isn't debilitated with pain is when the gathering is scheduled for.  But even if I knew that was the case I would not have considered telling my family we can't go then because of his soccer game.

and she replied 'im not coming if he's there'

fast forward to today, im three years sober. lived with my dad ever since the argument, and me and my mom still have an on and off rocky relationship. my current bf of four years proposed about 6 months ago, and we've been trying to get things planned for next summer. we want to make sure we're prepared, which includes our save the dates, best thing is to be early right?

what my mom said has always stuck with me, so i decided to not send her an invite, she has a tendency to be snotty, make petty comments and cause drama, especially  with my dad, and i didnt want a big blow up at my wedding.

she saw my brothers invite and messaged me asking where hers was. i ignored her, and she rang me. i told her i remembered what she said, and she cant come because my dad is coming. she told me not to be ungrateful and that she raised me and she should be invited anyway. i told her im not having her ruin the wedding, and hung up. i feel kind of guilty because she has done a lot for me, but i feel like its a situation where she loves me because im her daughter, but doesnt like me as my own person

11,1dduh20,AITA for reporting another student for racism after he called me a 'Snow bunny'?,"My school has started doing a programme with another school which allows their Sixth Form students to come and study a subject at our school.

I'm not in Sixth Form, I'm 15F, but my Tutor is a Sixth Form teacher so we take Morning registers in her classroom in the Sixth Form block. Other people who go to school in England will know that your Tutor's class is kind of like your base. At least it is in my school. 

Anyway, a group of boys from the other school have come here to study Programming or something idk, but they line up outside my class three mornings a week. Their bus brings them early and so whenever we leave for our classes in the morning, they're all crowding outside our Tutor's classroom.

Since Easter, they've been cat-calling and generally harassing myself and the four other white girls in the class. They're obnoxious anyway with the noise, swearing, loud music on their phones etc as we're still in the classroom so we avoid eye contact, talking or even looking in their direction. But I had enough today and so did my friend.

We were walking past and they started again with the same thing they keep saying, 'need me a snow bunny', 'need to make it snow' and other disgusting things all centred on the phrase 'Snow Bunny'. 

I told my Tutor and said 'I was racially abused and it's been happening for weeks now', she heard me out and agreed it was a disgusting term and so she escalated it to my Head of Year. She heard me out and said it wasn't racist. I disagreed and said they haven't said anything like this to the other girls in the class who are either Punjabi, Chinese or Mixed-race.

She patronised me about American attitudes (I'm American but my parents moved to England for me to attend this school), told me that they're from a different lifestyle because they're from (it's an inner-city place) and I should have 'cultural compassion'. I told her 'I don't know why you're treating them like aliens, aren't manners universal'. She considered that to be disrespectful and called my parents. 

Long story short, my Headteacher has said that the language used was dehumanising and degrading and so the boys will be made to apologise to me. She said if I felt uncomfortable then they will be removed from the school.

My Mom is firmly on my side but my Dad thinks calling it racist is 'an overexaggeration'. I don't think it is but now this evening I've seen a 'bait' page on TikTok for their school posting about me being racist and a white supremacist. I don't think I was being racist and I do want them removed but I also don't want my face and name plastered everywhere online over this.

My friends all agree that they were gross and haven't stopped naturally when we've ignored them so what else could we do? But my classmate who is mixed-race thinks it's a microaggression and we're being 'retaliatory'.

EDIT; so I‚Äôve been compared to the woman who lied about Emmett Till and been accused of lying because no black boy would ever do anything to a white woman. I‚Äôm muting this now.

My uncle is diabetic and needs to measure out his meals. He can‚Äôt eat many things so he has his own foods that only he eats. Otherwise, my aunt and I share the same food in the fridge and she always gets new things to try.

Last night I was making Mac n Cheese (it was really just random pasta with some different cheeses in the fridge) and grabbed some shredded cheese to use. Halfway through adding it, my aunt says that‚Äôs my uncle‚Äôs shredded cheese that he started using for meal prep. I didn‚Äôt finish the bag but I took enough where it would probably not add up to enough ounces for his meals. (About 3 pinches)

We don‚Äôt have the best relationship. He has anger issues and attributes it to work. I don‚Äôt have a job and rely on them for groceries, but I do help around the house and babysit my younger neice. I got the idea to replenish the shredded cheese to avoid any arguments about someone touching his food. I searched around in my room for any spare change or dollars I could find and went to the grocery store to buy another bag of cheese.

When I got back, he was home and asked where I went. I told him I accidentally used some of his cheese and I bought an extra bag. He then starts yelling at me for eating his cheese, that he only has limited things he can eat, why did I eat the one thing he has to flavor his meals, and that I‚Äôm trying to play martyr buying more cheese when I have nothing to spend. 

I tell him I‚Äôm just making up for my mistake and he says to stop playing the hero and that I shouldn‚Äôt have done anything or told him anything. He says if I could buy my own cheese then I should buy my own food instead of eating their‚Äôs.

My aunt assured me he didn‚Äôt mean what he said but that I should‚Äôve just waited for her to replace the cheese instead of ‚Äúcalling attention to yourself‚Äù. She said I was acting dramatic by spending what I had left on his cheese instead of just admitting to him that I took the cheese first.

My mom (51F) and dad (53M) got divorced last year. I, (23F) and sister (19F) got stuck in the middle quite often. 

Long story short, my dad kept the house. My sister and I still live with dad. Mom lives elsewhere.

17,1ddt8id,AITA for telling my friend shes better off without her ex?,"My friend (37F) recently broke up with her boyfriend of several years and is devastated by it, I am sympathetic to this, but the guy made a list of why he was breaking up with her.

My friend, lets call her Elle, suffers from extreme anxiety and sevre depression. She recently finished 2 years on workers comp for mental injuries sustained at work. During that time she built and moved into her own home. The partner, lets call him Ted, moved in also.

After two years in the newly built home he demanded she move with him to another city 2 hours away from her family and friends, because he hates our country town. She did, giving up her newly built home.

While in the new city she studied for and got a new job, settled into a new home and made new friends. After 8 months in the new city he dumps her. He told her:

She lacks drive. Her mental health issues are all in her head. She doesn't exercise (mind you shes like 80kgs and slim). Her new job doesn't pay enough. Taking time off from work for mental injuries is pathetic.

Now I am aware I may be biased as shes been my friend for 25 years and I always found this guy arrogant.

I've been supportive because of how hurt she is, but I have also told her she is better off without him.

I agreed, it wouldn't be my first time doing things like this with her and i tend to enjoy it. problem is that the venue has assigned seating that you have to pay for, and the available seats are not all together. my gfs family is pretty large and they were able to get seats roughly grouped together, but id have to get a seat away from them or switch with someone who will sit away from everyone instead.

I don't want to sit by myself, it would just be very awkward for me. her niece is only 4 and she probably won't notice me if im not with the rest of her family, and there will be plenty of opportunities later on when she's older. so basically i told my gf that if i have to sit by myself i wont go. my gfs sister (nieces mom) offered to sit by herself so she can get a seat closer to the stage, so in my head everything works out.

but my gf is now upset with me because i didn't accept the initial proposal and my attendance would feel insincere. to her it feels that i dont want to go and im only going because she asked, not because of her niece. i love that kid and i do want to go, but im simply not close enough to her or her family to justify paying money to sit alone when she won't even remember i was there.

i don't understand why she's so upset with me even though we found a solution, but i can understand her perspective and refusing to go if im sitting alone definitely doesn't help my case.

21,1delaup,AITA for refusing to help someone I don't know?,"EDIT: forgot to add, she asked me to be the person to make the phone call.

So this happened a couple of nights ago and at first I didn't think I was the AH but I'm not so sure anymore.

My (28f) mother (46) called me at 8pm, now my mother rarely calls me. We have an okay relationship but I do most of the communication, so this was odd .I answer and the first thing she says is ""I need you're help, I think you're the only one that will help me,""
Oooookay, so I ask what's up and it basically boils down to the following situation;
Mum manages a petrol (gas station for those in the US), one of her young employees is pregnant and going through a hard time was working and a customer handed in a wallet found near the station. Owner of the wallet was found but has claimed there was $300 inside when it was lost. Customer who turned in wallet admitted to and played back $100 that he stole. 
It turns out that the employee has admitted to taking the other $200 and will give it back.

Now to me this doesn't sound like an issue, give the money back and it all goes away (what owner of the wallet wants, doesn't want police involved unless it is his last resort), easy right? Apparently not. 
My mother has had the idea to make an anonymous phone call to her assistant manager at the station, claiming to be the mother of the customer who handed in the wallet, and say that they found that their son lied about the money and that they will be returning the money to the station for return to the owner so that this employee doesn't face any repercussions.

I said no immediately and told her that this plan was way too complicated and would blow up and the only (and easiest) way for this to be handled is if this employee returns the money and admits what she has done, and that I wouldn't stick my neck out like that for someone I don't know. 
This turned into an argument, in which, my mother said ""I expected you to help because you've been in trouble before and I've helped you, she reminds me of you, and it doeant matter if you dont know her, I do.""

While yes I have gotten myself in trouble, I knew where to draw a line. I never stole from my employment and I worked extremely hard to turn my life around. Not only that, she's my mother, if she wouldn't help me who would have?

Also ik it‚Äôs him bc my mom is dieting and my dad is diabetic so they both only have desserts sometimes.

 So anyways this problem really starts bc i bought a mini fridge so i could save someone the food i made before my brother could eat it (for example i only eat like 1/12 cookies my dad would eat 1/12 and my mom would eat 1/12 my other siblings would eat 1/12 and my brother just eats the rest)‚Ä¶ I have the mini fridge in my bathroom so my brother can‚Äôt eat it (ik im pretty) but i made cookies recently so i just physically gave the cookies to my other family members and in our family group chat my other sibling was complimenting me and our brother got super mad. he was like ‚Äúi pick you up from school everyday and i do blah blah blah‚Äù (there‚Äôs a school bus i can take but he picks me up cus he likes driving) but now i feel bad but atleast i can eat in peace and actually enjoy what i bake for a couple days after i make it.

My brother isn‚Äôt necessarily fat but he‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúfitness bros‚Äù and a ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù so he‚Äôs entitled. he eats all of the oreos within a week so i got my own pack and i haven‚Äôt finished it in 2 months. Also i made banana bread and he ate it before me and my dad couldn‚Äôt have a piece bc my brother ate it.. There was a lot so it could have been finished by the next few days but he ate it ofc. Also ik it‚Äôs him bc my mom is dieting and my dad is diabetic so they both only have desserts sometimes.

 So anyways this problem really starts bc i bought a mini fridge so i could save someone the food i made before my brother could eat it (for example i only eat like 1/12 cookies my dad would eat 1/12 and my mom would eat 1/12 my other siblings would eat 1/12 and my brother just eats the rest)‚Ä¶ I have the mini fridge in my bathroom so my brother can‚Äôt eat it (ik im pretty) but i made cookies recently so i just physically gave the cookies to my other family members and in our family group chat my other sibling was complimenting me and our brother got super mad. he was like ‚Äúi pick you up from school everyday and i do blah blah blah‚Äù (there‚Äôs a school bus i can take but he picks me up cus he likes driving) but now i feel bad but atleast i can eat in peace and actually enjoy what i bake for a couple days after i make it.

tldr: my brother eats everything i bake (way more then me and the rest of the family) so i got a mini fridge so i can have extra food now he‚Äôs mad. ",0.0,-0.01267949491739273,0,1

25,1dek5u2,AITA for kicking my stepsister out of my birthday trip?,"I (19F) am the daughter of separated parents, and my father's new wife has a daughter, Sophie (18F).

Last year my friends and I, including my best friend, May (20F), Debby (20F), and another 4 girls, decided to go on a trip for  to celebrate my birthday.

My father called me to ask me to take Sophie with us, because she felt a little left out and i acepted it, even if me and her didint have a close relationship.

The trip was one of the best of my life, but I noticed that May was a little down. I asked what was wrong and she said she was fine, just a little tired, so I believed her.

When we returned home, we promised that the following year we would repeat the trip if possible.

But this year, when I started preparing everything, Debby came to talk to me and showed me prints from a group chat that i was not part, which had the exact date of the time we were on the trip, last year, where Sophie was talking bad about May and calling her names, like  ""Whale"", ""Fat bit\*\*"" and other cruel things.

(For context, May is a fat woman.)

I spoke to May and she confirmed that during the trip, Sophie was completely unpleasant to her, always commenting on her body and her personality, for no apparent reason. But she didn't say anything, so as not to ruin the vibe of the trip party, and to not create tension between me and my father's side of the family, and after the trip, she ended up forgeting about completly.

I went to my father's house, and told Sophie that I knew everything, and she turned pale when she saw the prints I had.

I basically kicked her out of the trip and told her I didn't want to see her again.

Now, the other girls in the group, apart from Debby and May, are saying that I was an asshole for kicking Sophie out for something so insignificant, and that if Sophie doesn't go, neither will they.

26,1dek1lp,AITA for calling out my brothers BS even if it causes arguments? ,"Since I was about 10, I realised my parents argue a lot, they aren‚Äôt romantically together but they both clearly care about each other a lot. 
My parents have unconditional love for me (27F) and my brother (30M), we are very fortunate and had the same, very loving upbringing. 

When we were teens my brother was mischievous and lazy, my parents would discipline him by taking away his PlayStation. But after he got too old for that and I think they were at loss with what to do except shout and moan.

He‚Äôs never done anything TERRIBLE but he is so lazy! 
His room is a tip, stacks of plates going mouldy, condiments, his clothes everywhere, it stinks! 
He‚Äôs never does any chores (without being asked), is wasteful with no concept of cost of bills. Almost everything he does do is for a selfish reason. 

Thrown out of school at 17 ish, was mostly unemployed until he secured a decent, physically demanding career at 27. I thought this might have been a new beginning but it didn‚Äôt changed anything except bcome a new excuse why he is ‚Äòtoo tired‚Äô to contribute towards household chores! 

Since we were teens and he started treating my parents like this, I call him out on it, which lead to tension in our relationship. 

After 21, Id tell my parents to throw him out! Let him learn what the real world is like, pay a bill, fend for himself instead of relying on them, but neither of them have the heart. His behaviour has caused very heated arguments over the years. 

I can‚Äôt stand it anymore. My parents are getting older now. When I come home to visit, I see them hobbling up and down the stairs, doing all the chores to look after themselves and this man child!

My dad has completely given up, he doesn‚Äôt say anything anymore, just allows it. My mum honestly is an enabler, she mollycoddles him by ‚Äòworrying‚Äô if she hasn‚Äôt cooked anything for him. She will half heartedly have a go at him sometimes but I think she lacks the energy now and fears that if she fights with him, he will abandon her love. 

He hates me for calling out his BS. It causes arguments and I think my parents wish I would just leave it be. But how can I just watch them be used? I can‚Äôt shake the thought that I think he‚Äôs putting them into an early grave and it makes it hard for me to even smile at him when we are trying to have family time. 

Honestly, I partly despise my parents for this too. If they had listened all those years ago and threw him out, it might have been rough in the beginning but it might have fixed his attitude. I might have a grown up, non-selfish brother and we might actually get on as a family. I often feel lonely when I wish for what could have been a ‚Äòproper family‚Äô.

27,1dek0mz,AITAH for wanting my fiance to give me a gift?,"

I, (40 yr/f) and my fiance (54 yr/m) have been together for 3 years. Firstly, I'll start off by saying that I do love my fiance and appreciate everything he has done for me. He helped me work through the roughest time in my life and for that I will forever be greatful. We have had a lot of financial struggles throughout our relationship but always make things work somehow. 
Anyway, getting to the story. My fiance has never bought me a gift. Not for Christmas, my birthday, our anniversary etc. I have with the exception of his birthday this year have always managed to buy him a gift. Not always huge gifts but something to make the day feel a little more special. Now, the reasoning behind me not purchasing him a gift for his birthday this year was, I requested that for my birthday (which is a month before his) this year that I wanted him to pick me out something. It didn't need to be diamonds or something insane just something small. All month leading up to it I gave him hints as he asked time and again. Welp, my birthday came and went and he said he didn't have time to buy me a gift and he would give me cash next time he got paid. I was really hurt. Fast forward to his birthday. I didn't purchase a gift but I did make a birthday banner and printed out photoshopped personally funny memes and displayed them all over. I felt to guilty not doing anything for him but that was my choice. 
A few weeks ago I cam across a vintage KISS button. Growing up he loved the band and dressed up with his friends as the band for Halloween etc. I was excited to give it to him and thought he would love it. 
Here's where I may be the big ""A"" in this situation. This morning (we share phones not a big deal if he's using mine for something I use his vice versa) I was on his phone and a messaged popped up from a girl that was a heart emoji. I clicked on it because I mean who wouldn't. I saw that he had messaged her asking if he wanted a vintage KISS button. I was so hurt. For 3 years this man has NEVER bought me a gift or made me a gift. I confronted him about it and how it hurt me and why. He said I was acting ""crazy"" about it. I tried to explain why it would hurt me on various levels but he didn't seem to care at all. This girl he's worked with for a few months gets given a gift that I gave to him. 
So, am I overreacting?

James is pretty chill, hangs out with us and joins in the conversations, only issue is James only wants to talk about his favourite anime and will bring it up in any conversation regardless of the topic, the mood or hell even if someone else is actively talking at the time.

At first we all tried to be kind about it, using the good old ""Huh, thats neat"" or ""yeah thats cool"" when those didn't work we tried explaining that none of us have seen the anime and none of us are particularly interested in it, we try and steer him back onto whatever we're talking about but its gotten to the point most of us just let James say his 'try and get us to talk about the anime' prompt so we can ignore it and move on with whatever we were doing.  
  
Its now gotten to the point that James will get quiet and end up leaving hang outs early because none of us can pretend to be interested anymore. Which feels really bad since James was the one who introduced the group to each other.

  
We've all acknowledged to each other that James looks pretty hurt by this but none of us want to bite the bullet and have to listen to another same conversation about that fucking anime.

So give me y'all's thoughts cause i damn well feel like the asshole.

TL:DR: Friend makes friend group then gets excluded from conversations cause none of us can handle his hyperfixation anymore. ",1.0,0.9796254634857178,1,1
32,1deiw9i,AITA for refusing to watch my cousin's kids anymore after she let me live with her rent free?,"I have a job coming up in a different state, and I wanted to visit my family before I went, since it's far away. So temporarily, my cousin said she would let me stay with her rent free.

I've been living on the couch for a month, and probably will for another month, since my offer was pushed back. I had to pawn off a lot of my stuff, since there was no room for it, which I've mostly accepted, since it was short notice. I do wish I had at least my own space.

She's also been paying for my food, since I wasn't expecting it to be this long, and didn't save up enough before moving, so I didn't want to complain. I haven't been doing chores much either, since her kids are MESSY, and I don't want to clean up after them constantly.

Initially, I didn't mind watching her kids, or letting her use my car. But it feels like she's taking advantage of me now. I've even told her I don't want to watch her kids all the time. She's started treating my car as her own, and will even leave it somewhere if her boyfriend picks her up, leaving me stranded. She will also plan on me watching her kids when she leaves, without asking me.

Yesterday, she said she was taking her kids somewhere, so I thought I could finally have some time to myself, but surprise, I had to watch her youngest because she's ""too young to go."" I normally go to the gym, but now it always feels like I'm too busy with her kids to do anything I want to do, and when I force the issue, it's mainly just to visit people I've been putting off visiting because of her, and I don't feel like I have any time to myself. I understand it's like that for parents, but I'm not a parent. They aren't my kids.

So I told her this, and said I can't keep watching her kids anymore and that she needs to get her own. It's too much for me, and they aren't my responsibility.

She got mad at me and told me if I hate it so much, that I should move out. That she's doing me a favor, and that since she hasn't made me pay rent and bought my food for me.

I agreed on that, but noticed that watching her kids is basically a full time job at this point, with permanent overtime. My SIL says that I should help her for her letting me stay and that I should also be helping with the chores, because being a parent is exhausting. Her husband (my brother) seems to understand my frustration, but wants to stay out of it, which I understand.

AITA for refusing to watch her kids anymore?

Edit: I don't mind watching her kids sometimes, or even letting her use my car. What I do mind is doing it 24/7. My point about the gym is that I go to the gym 30 minutes to an hour a few times a week, and I don't even have time to do that. I've also let her stay at my place before, before she had kids, and didn't ask anything from her.

Edit: Being an on call babysitter 24/7 is not equivalent for meals and only a couch to sleep on. She's getting way more out of this deal than I am, and people are on here calling me a deadbeat and a leech.

Edit: I've also offered to pay her $500 after I get my job. I think that's more than fair for what I got out of it.

33,1deitrt,AITA for being willing to run against my friend for student government ,"I have this one friend (I'll refer to her as P) in school who I'm really close to. I'm a high school sophomore this year, and I've known her since we were about 8 years old, but we only got super close last freshman year. P ran for student government this year and was unchallenged for the position she ran for. I feel a bit rude for saying this, but the other person who was supposed to have run against her was much more likely to win because she has started fights with about 60% of our grade.

I was talking to her and another friend of mine today about how I wanted to run for a position next year. My senior year will be pretty lax, so I'll have the time, and I'm also pretty well-liked, so I have a chance of winning. She got mad and asked if I would be willing to run against her, saying it's shitty of me to do that because it would affect our friendship. But that led to me being annoyed internally because the only reason I'd be willing to run against her is because she's my friend, and I trust that our friendship wouldn't be ruined by something like this.

She proceeded to get mad and run off when I pointed out that I'd be willing to run against her. At that point, my other friend (I'll call her S) and I decided to take a walk around the school. When we got back, P and her boyfriend were there and they were talking. P proceeded to ask her boyfriend if either of us would win, and he instantly said she would, which makes sense because he's her boyfriend. He then went on to say that he'd be telling all his friends to vote for her instead of me if we ever ran against each other, even though I'm significantly closer to his friend group than she is.

I did apologize to her about it because I felt bad, and she said she was upset because I was willing to run against her even though we're interested in completely different positions anyway.

  
Edit: I just wanted to add that when I was walking around with S, we were talking about it, and she was saying that P has been insecure about her popularity because her boyfriend is insanely popular and she barely talks to people.

Today he went to school while I, my mother and my other brother (3m) stayed home. My littlest brother, who I will call MA, had the TV all morning to keep him quiet. At about 10am she took him out, and at about 3pm I got on the TV to play Minecraft. At about the same time, my other brother, who I will call LU, came home from school. 

Its worth mentioning here that he has a game he really loves to play that he can ONLY play on our Xbox. So after an hour of play I handed the Xbox over to him so he could have a turn. Almost immediately, out mother came barging in, demanding that he turn his game off so MA can have the TV. I suggested that MA watch his cartoons on my phone so LU can have a turn on his game- therefore, everyone is happy. She shot me down saying everyone was happy anyway so why bother, ignoring LU's protests that he WASN'T. So when she went outside to smoke I went behind her back and put the cartoons on my phone. MA was perfectly happy until he realised LU was getting a turn on the Xbox and then demanded his cartoons back on the TV. So my mum walked in on this and got pissed off because she'd said it was MA's turn on the Xbox. Then she went and physically turned off the TV to stop LU playing. I got up and turned it back on. I told her plain and simple that I thought she was being unfair. She replied 'life's not fair.' She asked me why I thought LU deserved a turn on the Xbox and who would keep MA entertained. I replied that *I* would. 

(For context, this is a weapon she uses regularly, the whole 'well you're not going to do anything that inconveniences you so you've got no leg to stand on'. She has a whole thing about how selfless she is and how everyone else owes her and how hard life is for her so she's allowed to do whatever she wants.)

At one point she even turned on him and said 'this is how I raised you. I distracted you with screens'. I don't know what the aim was but the tone was malicious as fuck.

36,1deio99,AITA for not wanting a friend to pass this year?,"
I‚Äôm in a trio of friends. One of them has bad grades, and I hope he won‚Äôt pass this year. I feel like my two friends don‚Äôt like me being part of their friendship. For example, we had a week full of school trips. On Monday, we had a 3-hour bus ride to a location. The week before, we had planned that friend 1 would sit next to me on the ride to the location, and friend 2 would sit next to me on the ride back. However, they both ended up sitting next to other people. The night before, they changed our plan and said I would sit alone on the first ride. Since I‚Äôm not a social person, I had no one else to sit next to. They said I could sit next to one of them on the ride back.

When we finished at the location and were about to leave, friend 2 was sitting next to me, but when friend 1 arrived at the bus, he switched seats. Friend 1 chose to not sit next to the person she wanted to first. On Wednesday of the same week, we had another trip. I arrived at the location with friend 1, but as soon as we arrived, both of them started talking and often discussed things I didn‚Äôt know about. I always try to fit in and talk about these things as much as I can.

After the event, we had some time to spare. The whole class was sitting in a park, and my friends and I were in a hidden corner. They made comments and jokes about how I weigh triple the weight of friend 1 (it‚Äôs not even double). I sarcastically said that this helps a lot with my eating disorder. For context, I had an eating disorder a year ago, and the issues with my friends make my mental health worse, so I started to stop eating again. Friend 1 said that I don‚Äôt have one, and it sounded like she was defending friend 2 because he made the comment.

After that, they decided to play phone games, which I hate, so I didn‚Äôt join them. I left because I felt bad when they were playing and spent an hour alone. It was also planned to go out after the school trip, but I decided not to because I was done with this. I have the feeling that they are excluding me, and since Monday, it‚Äôs gotten worse.

I explained my reasonings why and it also stems from my job, I am a paediatric nurse and over the last several years I have worked with a range of illnesses, I have worked with babies who have sadly passed due to contracting RSV and herpes from being kissed by someone with a cold sore. So as a nurse we always advise parents about being careful when allowing people to kiss their babies. 

Anyways fast forward and when my daughter arrived we send out a very generic message to everyone which included about we would appreciate that people would not kiss the baby. 

Every time my mum sees my daughter she is always over the top and constantly rubbing her face on my daughter's face and sniffing her face (nose touching) and then always makes a comment ""I'm not kissing"" but always looking at me.

Also at the end of most visits my mum always waits until everyone else is out of earshot (including my husband) and asks me if she can give her a kiss and even after I say no she responds ""but why"", ""come on just a little kiss"".

41,1degsel,AITA for redecorating my partner's family home where I live,"throwaway account...

I live with my partner of nearly 5 years in his family's old ranch home. We have livestock, and we both work. I work from home and am the day-to-day ranch manager. I'm also the one who takes care of the house mostly. I've been living here since spring 2022.

This house is about 100 years old and the ranch has been in my partner's family for several generations. When I first moved in his mother (who grew up in the house) was living here. For health reasons, she had to move out and go live with her husband about a year and a half ago. They really don't get along, and she wishes she were still living here. She and her husband visit every weekend for lunch and spend about 6 hours. She still has a bedroom here but hardly ever stays over.

I've always really struggled with the way the house was decorated and organized. It was filled with knick knacks and hobby lobby farm charm art. It felt crowded and tacky to me. It was also super hard to keep clean. Since the mom moved out, I've been slowly ""de-decorating."" At first it was just to help me keep it clean more easily. There is a huge housefly problem here and anything fabric or with nooks and crannies just gets so dirty, covered in fly poop and their little dead bodies. But then I started to really like how it looked-- and how I felt-- when there was less clutter. So I kept going. Re the organization, it's a small house and all the most accessible spaces were filled with staged knick knacks. Then you're not left with anywhere to put the things you actually use... I reorganized so that these spaces are for what we use most often. I've also been replacing the soulless Hobby Lobby art with family photos. I got some of her old photos restored, colorized, and framed. I'd like to also get some nice photos that were taken here blown up. The final thing I did was install a dishwasher.

I never did ask permission for these changes (except the dishwasher). Partly because she had moved out and had said (several times), ""well, you guys live here now."" Anything that was removed was carefully packed up and put into a storage shed to keep it safe. And I haven't made any permanent changed (except the dishwasher). I also didn't ask because I just wanted to get things done and, honestly, I didn't want her input. These are all things that help us be more comfortable and take care of the ranch and home more efficiently. She doesn't understand our needs, and we just have really different taste.

Recently, I think I crossed some sort of threshold. I removed this giant photo/ print of water pitchers that was propped up on hutch. It really overpowered the room, and so it was pretty apparent that it was gone. Now she's very anxious about all this stuff and texting my partner to ask where I put random things and what I've changed. In many way she still regards this as her house. For example, she likes to read farm decor magazines and will sometimes who up with decorations or a new idea for a project (that she wants us to do). I feel like we're living in her doll house.

I'm working my \*ss off trying to do my full time job and run this place day-to-day. I would really love to just feel comfy in the house. I'm a person who's sensitive to their surroundings, and I need a place to live that supports me. I don't want the emotional or mental work of asking permission and consulting on this sort of stuff. I think there will be a big talk this weekend. I am happy to tell her my plans, which are mostly more storage in the mudroom, improvement to my little office space, and cool animal photos in the living room. But I won't be asking permission. Even though these are relatively small things, I fear she will say ""no"" just out of a panicky need to assert herself.

I am very close with my daughters but they were both definitely mama‚Äôs girls. My wife was a magnetic woman. She was beautiful, intelligent, kind, and people were drawn to her. 

An important thing to know about my wife is that she had a passion for writing. She was unfortunately in a profession where she didn‚Äôt write much so, she did a lot on her own time. One of her favorite things to write was letters. She wanted people to know that she cared about them. 

After she had each of my daughters, she wrote them a letter. She wrote each within days after their births and wanted to give them away on their graduation days. She put them in the fire box in our basement to avoid losing or forgetting about them. She wrote the letters with the intention of giving them to our daughters herself 18 years later as a sort of time capsule type of thing. Both letters contained mostly words of wisdom and information about what was going on when they were born. 

Maeve graduated from high school today and I went to her room with the letter tonight. I let her cry on my shoulder as she read it and at first she seemed happy to have her something directly from her mother. However after she read it she turned to me looking surprisingly angry. She asked why I had waited so long to give it to her. She had so many rough moments and heartbreak in the last 8 years where all she wanted was her mother‚Äôs wisdom and I withheld the letter. 

I told her that I was just doing what her mother had said she wanted and Maeve shot back that her mother also hadn‚Äôt planned on being in the accident. Alex heard the shouting and came into the room and Maeve told her about the letter. 

Now they‚Äôre both upset and don‚Äôt want to talk to me. I feel so awful about this whole situation. I was raised by my single mother after my own dad took off so on one hand, I‚Äôve always wanted to be the best father I can and I feel terrible that I withheld something that would‚Äôve brought them comfort.

I lost her in a car accident 8 years ago. We had two beautiful daughters together, Maeve (18 now, 10 when her mother passed) and Alex (16 now, 8 when her mother passed). 

I am very close with my daughters but they were both definitely mama‚Äôs girls. My wife was a magnetic woman. She was beautiful, intelligent, kind, and people were drawn to her. 

An important thing to know about my wife is that she had a passion for writing. She was unfortunately in a profession where she didn‚Äôt write much so, she did a lot on her own time. One of her favorite things to write was letters. She wanted people to know that she cared about them. 

After she had each of my daughters, she wrote them a letter. She wrote each within days after their births and wanted to give them away on their graduation days. She put them in the fire box in our basement to avoid losing or forgetting about them. She wrote the letters with the intention of giving them to our daughters herself 18 years later as a sort of time capsule type of thing. Both letters contained mostly words of wisdom and information about what was going on when they were born. 

Maeve graduated from high school today and I went to her room with the letter tonight. I let her cry on my shoulder as she read it and at first she seemed happy to have her something directly from her mother. However after she read it she turned to me looking surprisingly angry. She asked why I had waited so long to give it to her. She had so many rough moments and heartbreak in the last 8 years where all she wanted was her mother‚Äôs wisdom and I withheld the letter. 

I told her that I was just doing what her mother had said she wanted and Maeve shot back that her mother also hadn‚Äôt planned on being in the accident. Alex heard the shouting and came into the room and Maeve told her about the letter. 

Now they‚Äôre both upset and don‚Äôt want to talk to me. I feel so awful about this whole situation. I was raised by my single mother after my own dad took off so on one hand, I‚Äôve always wanted to be the best father I can and I feel terrible that I withheld something that would‚Äôve brought them comfort. On the other hand, my wife had very specific instructions about her intentions with the letters and I just wanted to follow through with that.

It lets me enjoy some of the summer break with them and gives their dad a bit of a break before I have to get into work mode for the day. It‚Äôs a city park that consists of a large grassy area with a playground in the middle. The playground is not fenced in, but it is its own delineated area that is bark chipped, so it‚Äôs still separate from the grassy area. It is a dog friendly park, and while there are no posted rules, generally people keep their dogs out of the playground area. I have no issue with dogs in general or at the park.

What I do have an issue with is sometimes in the morning, there is a woman who will train her dog to do runs on the playground equipment. (I am not sure if ‚Äúruns‚Äù is the right way to describe what she‚Äôs doing‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs literally like she‚Äôs doing a dog show course with the dog, up the stairs, through the tunnels, down slides, etc and then gives the dog treats when it does well) 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with this. It doesn‚Äôt feel safe. I know it‚Äôs a dog friendly park, but the playground space is designed for kids and kids should allowed to play in their space without worrying about a dog. Also, It‚Äôs clearly a well loved pup and I don‚Äôt want to be held liable if my kid accidentally slides into it or something like that.

50,1defiz4,AITA for 'metagaming' during a party game?,"I (18M) went to a party with some of my friends and two cousins of mine, all of us from 17-19 years of age. Worth noting that my cousins and I are black.

The party (a schoolmate's birthday with a lot of neighborhood kids) was chill and we decided to play a bit of pictionary with pokemon, as many of us were, and there were a lot of colored markers. I was on a team with my white ginger friend (Falkner) and one of my cousins and we were playing against 4 teams of mixed ethnicity but there was one team of all white people including Pryce (also about 18). It was my team's turn and Falkner started to draw for our team. We guessed Onix and Jigglypuff then he drew the next card

His eyes went wide on the next card. He discarded his black marker and picked up a purple one before freezing. He seemed panicked so on a whim I said Jynx. We got another point and continued playing the game. We didn't win but we got very close to getting third place of the 5 teams.

Afterwards the pizza arrived and when we were eating Pryce said I was against the spirit of the game. He said that I was watching Falkner's mouth  mannerisms, which was not a good look. He started to elaborate saying that Jynx was a stereotype and he commended Falkner for not even drawing it. I was so confused on his high and mighty stance and asked him about it. ""Why are you talking about stereotypes to bring the mood down?""

He said that wasn't his intention but then deflected to Falkner. He said that FAlkner should have just discarded the card and it would be more fun that way. I was annoyed at him deflecting everything but I just asked him to shut up so we can keep enjoying the party but afterwards it felt like he was judging me silently

After that I walked home with my friends and cousin about how annoyed I was with Pryce. They were saying things like ""Well Pryce is always like that"" and I didn't have to take the bait. THey said I should essentially get over it but I feel like Pryce attacked my character. I said that I didn't want to play a game with Pryce and my cousin got mad because we had other game plans with Pryce and his girlfriend (my other cousin).

53,1def7ov,AITA for telling my mom not to come visit me when my child is born?,"My mom (54F) has been a loving mother, but an immature one. She took all the responsibility of raising me after she and my dad divorced. She got married when I was 8 to a douchebag that surprisingly did treat me very well. She took care of me and fought for my life when I had a life threathening condition. 

 However, when I was around 14 yo and she god rid of her useless husband she got involved with one of her employees who was 18 at the time (she was 38).

 I was mocked and ridiculized because of this. The ""relationship"" (they were never official/public) lasted for 10 years and it was very toxic, and his family took advantage of my mom and betrayed her. I do know that my mom did wrong as he was really young and she was in a position of power, besides knowing him since he was a child as he was our neighbour. 

 She did totally innappropiate things like taking him to my college accomodation when she visited me and making him sleep in my bedroom. 

After that affaire ended she hooked up with a quite nice and age appropiate guy (I'll call him Gabriel), however she scared him by being to clingy and he very politely and nicely told her that he wasn't interested in having a relationship with her. 

She, however got obsessed. A few months after this she offered him a job in her shop,  creating a position that didn't exist just to have him around. I kept my mouth shut since she is very explosive and always tells me I don't get to have an opinion on her life choices.

 I live aborad and I got pregnant after being bullied and fired on my job, which lead me to sue the company. Needless to say, it's been a rough year. 

As I am pregnant I can't work, so I asked my mom if I could help her at her bussiness for free, as I can do it remotely. She told me she had to ask Gabriel... I didn't say anything but was shocked. He gave her lame excuses and she told me it wasn't possible for ""technical reasons"". 

I showed her it wasn't true, and that Gabriel was lying about some stuff and she lost it. She told me that I wanted him fired, yelled at me and told me that if I was that interested in the business I had to move back home. I had enough at that point and told her Gabriel doesn't love her and never will, and that I wanted her out of my house. 

I'ts been 2 months and I haven't spoke to her. She was supposed to come in august when my baby is born but I decided I don't want her here, as she clearly prefers Gabriel over me.

So, am I being unreasonable? It hurts me so much that she didn't let me work in the family bussines just to keep a man that, by the way has a girlfriend and has made very clear is not interested in her.  

Am I being the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-12,"AITA for telling my mom not to come visit me when my child is born? My mom (54F) has been a loving mother, but an immature one. She took all the responsibility of raising me after she and my dad divorced. She got married when I was 8 to a douchebag that surprisingly did treat me very well. She took care of me and fought for my life when I had a life threathening condition. 

 However, when I was around 14 yo and she god rid of her useless husband she got involved with one of her employees who was 18 at the time (she was 38).

 I was mocked and ridiculized because of this. The ""relationship"" (they were never official/public) lasted for 10 years and it was very toxic, and his family took advantage of my mom and betrayed her. I do know that my mom did wrong as he was really young and she was in a position of power, besides knowing him since he was a child as he was our neighbour. 

 She did totally innappropiate things like taking him to my college accomodation when she visited me and making him sleep in my bedroom. 

After that affaire ended she hooked up with a quite nice and age appropiate guy (I'll call him Gabriel), however she scared him by being to clingy and he very politely and nicely told her that he wasn't interested in having a relationship with her. 

She, however got obsessed. A few months after this she offered him a job in her shop,  creating a position that didn't exist just to have him around. I kept my mouth shut since she is very explosive and always tells me I don't get to have an opinion on her life choices.

 I live aborad and I got pregnant after being bullied and fired on my job, which lead me to sue the company. Needless to say, it's been a rough year. 

As I am pregnant I can't work, so I asked my mom if I could help her at her bussiness for free, as I can do it remotely. She told me she had to ask Gabriel... I didn't say anything but was shocked. He gave her lame excuses and she told me it wasn't possible for ""technical reasons"". 

I showed her it wasn't true, and that Gabriel was lying about some stuff and she lost it. She told me that I wanted him fired, yelled at me and told me that if I was that interested in the business I had to move back home. I had enough at that point and told her Gabriel doesn't love her and never will, and that I wanted her out of my house. 

I'ts been 2 months and I haven't spoke to her. She was supposed to come in august when my baby is born but I decided I don't want her here, as she clearly prefers Gabriel over me. 

She asked me today if I'll allow her to come and I told her no. 

So, am I being unreasonable? It hurts me so much that she didn't let me work in the family bussines just to keep a man that, by the way has a girlfriend and has made very clear is not interested in her.

A few weeks ago, me, Sally, and another friend decided to go see one of our favorite comedians. We agreed on a date, I bought the tickets, and they each sent me the money for their ticket. The tickets were $100 a piece (good venue, good seats, prominent/famous comedian). 

Late last week, Sally told me she couldn't go anymore due to a scheduling conflict with her work that she had misscheduled. She asked if there was any way I could send her the $100 back. Because the ticket is nonrefundable, I told Sally that I would send her the money back if someone else could buy the ticket from me, or if Sally could find someone to buy the ticket from her. Sally agreed that was fair. 

Well, now the show is the day after tomorrow and I have no takers. One friend, Jane, said she could go but she couldn't afford the ticket right now. Jane said she fully understood if the ticket went to someone else who could pay, but said she'd be glad to come along if there weren't any takers by showtime and she didn't have to pay. Jane even offered to drive us all and be DD so we could drink at the show, in order to contribute as best she could. I basically told Jane that if no one had bought the ticket by the day of the show, it could go to her so it wouldn't be wasted. 

I followed up with Sally today to tell her no one has wanted to buy the ticket so far, and Sally said she hasn't had any luck either. I told her that if I couldn't sell it by the day of, I would give it to Jane, but that Jane couldn't pay. Sally says that in that case, I should send her $100 because I'm giving away her ticket. I argued that someone should get the ticket if it's going to go unused, but Sally says it's her ticket and if she wants it to go unused then it should go unused, or if she wanted to give it away she should be the one to give it away. I asked if she would just give it away to Jane on the day of so it wouldn't go unused, but she said no, ""it's the principle of the thing."" She just hates the idea of her ticket that she paid for being given to someone else for free. 

WIBTA if I just give away the ticket a few hours before showtime? Or am I actually stealing something that doesn't belong to me?

59,1deei7x,AITA for wanting space from my NEFT friend (now ex),"
So I had this friend since college. We were practically inseparable. We used to stay like couple buildings apart in college. And used to stay over at each others place for some days when preparing for exams and stuff and it never really created a problem to share each others space for that short span of time. Now In college also this thing about her used to really frustrate me that she never put her effort into any assignment and always blindly copied from me. But that was it. No other problem and never confronted her about this either. 

So anyway fast forward to 5 years later, we both get a job but in different cities. I move to my own place and have a nice life actually. She doesn‚Äôt like the city she moved into and wanted to move closer to me. And I let her. She would now be sharing the same room with me. It did bug me but I thought it didn‚Äôt matter because my boyfriend was long distance anyway and I was under the impression that I would like her company. But after I made this call of letting her stay and before she actually moved in I broke up with my boyfriend and was single. And when she came to live with me I actually started seeing someone else. Now obviously I am in a new relationship phase with someone and wanted to spend time with them and couldn‚Äôt do it at my place because she was there so we had to be at his place always. Thus began the allegations of not spending time with her. I wasn‚Äôt even 20 days into dating this guy and I had to rush back home. I spend 1 month at home and when I came back she had gone away. For the whole month. So I don‚Äôt know how the fuck is it my fault that she was there for me to spend time with her. And she obviously had a problem that when she wasn‚Äôt there I spent time with my boyfriend. In this time she has already managed to create problems by being rude to my landlady who wanted to kick her out but she was shameless enough to keep staying there because of which my rent increased. all these reasons kept distancing us and she couldn‚Äôt spend time with her own boyfriend because the situation didn‚Äôt allow and then he moved abroad. Before he moved, she never missed one single fucking chance to have him over whenever I went to be with my boyfriend. And it was still somehow me who was boyfriend centric and not her.We were already sharing a room and she called her brother to stay with us for 2 weeks without asking me. And on confronting her the reply was that I am anyway not there im always at my boyfriends so what difference does it make if she called someone to live with us. Fucking miser. finally when things got out of hand we had a major falling out. After 4 months she confronted me and her blame was that she was going through a tough time because her boyfriend moved abroad and I wasn‚Äôt there for her.

61,1dedklh,AITA for lashing out on my ex and his friends?,"I (15F) and my ex bf (16M) had been in a relationship for 9 months and since we were together for long, some of his close friends ended up becoming mine. We had a group chat and we had really good times, as some even ended up becoming some of my friends too. Keep in mind that I had some failed situationships the past couple of years and I do have trauma from that. Moving on, my bf that time was amazing and I was the best I could be, but I sometimes felt he was distant with me after a couple months into the relationship. This was his first relationship, which I understood and guided him on how to be a good boyfriend, but I felt he was lacking at times. We did communicate well, so there wasn‚Äôt an issue but I still felt hurt sometimes and felt I was bothering him, so I blocked him twice. It was purely impulse and I don‚Äôt know if I was wrong. Near the end of the relationship he was really distant and didn‚Äôt talk to me much. He did tell me his mom had cancer and he had to be there for her, but I still felt like he could have made some time for me and talked a little. After this went on for a while, he broke up with me. I predicted this was going to happen eventually.. so I just didn‚Äôt care. After this, all our mutual friends stopped talking to me, except maybe one or two of them. When I tried asking what went wrong, they refused to tell me and told me to talk to him instead. 

My ex did have this one girl friend but he assured me repeatedly that she used to keep annoying him and talking to him even when he didn‚Äôt want to since she always asked him for relationship advice and if I ever wanted, he would block her without a moment‚Äôs notice, though I said I was fine with him talking with her and I told him I knew he was not a person to cheat on me. After we broke up, I heard some rumors from the girl that she liked him and I was hurt cause I thought nothing was going on between them. So, I assumed he was cheating on me and that is why he broke up with me. I even confided in my friends about my assumptions. A couple of weeks later, one of my oldest friend decided to make a group chat so everyone could talk it all out, with my ex included. I wanted to have a civilized chat, but they attacked me by saying I was the one who ruined the relationship.. even my ex gave a list of reasons why I was ‚Äúapparently a bad girlfriend.‚Äù He also clarified that he broke off his friendship with his girl friend and never cheated on me. He was mad that I spread rumors about him, when I clearly just confided in 6-7 of my friends.. but I got defensive, explaining that I didn‚Äôt know that and that it was his fault. I tried to explain how I just acted impulsive and that these were my emotions, but none of them weren‚Äôt accepting that answer. I get really mad when someone pisses me off, so I started shouting at them and eventually blocked all of them including my ex boyfriend. And now, none of us are talking to each other.

First Part. I'm a corporal at a small correctional facility in the American Midwest. The security department is not provided gloves for our day to day operations.

Second part.

69,1decqa3,AITA for kicking my mil out of my house?,"
I 25m and my wife 23m met we knew we were ment for eachother and a year into our relationship I proposed to her and 
the moment I married my wife I knew I was in for a wild ride with her mother She was a woman of strong opinions and an even stronger voice, never shy to share her thoughts, especially when it came to me.

The first time I met her, she eyed me up and down like I was a sheep at the market. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs been courting my daughter? I hope you‚Äôre not planning on living off her good graces.‚Äù I barely managed a polite smile, already feeling the sweat trickle down my back.

Every Sunday, we‚Äôd go over to her house for dinner, and every Sunday, it was the same routine. My mil would critique my clothes, my job, and even the way I buttered my bread. ‚Äú are you sure you know how to do that? You‚Äôre making a right mess of it,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, as if I hadn‚Äôt been buttering bread my whole life.

One particular evening stands out in my memory. My wife and I had just announced that we were expecting our first child. I was over the moon, but my mils reaction was less than enthusiastic. ‚ÄúWell, I hope you‚Äôre ready for sleepless nights and dirty nappies. It‚Äôs not all fun and games, you know,‚Äù she said, with a stern look that could curdle milk.

As the months went by, her comments became even more frequent. ‚Äú do you really think you can handle being a father? You can barely keep the house in order!‚Äù she‚Äôd exclaim, shaking her head. I tried my best to stay patient, for my wifes sake, but it wasn‚Äôt easy.

When our little one finally arrived, I was determined to prove My mil wrong. I changed nappies, rocked the baby to sleep, and even managed to cook a few meals without burning them. But no matter what I did, it never seemed to be enough. ‚Äú, are you sure you‚Äôre holding the baby right? You don‚Äôt want to drop her,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, hovering over me like a hawk. She always wanted us to formula feed our daughter but my wife wanted to breast feed and her mother seemed to have a problem with that but she never said why 

One day, I‚Äôd had enough I walked into my daughters room and there was my mother in law givingbher formula i grabbed the bottle off her and asked her ""what the fuck she was doing"" i was trying to keep my cool ""why are you giving out daughter formula"" I said really pissed off ""my granddaughter needs to be on formula so I can take her to my house"" and sye said it in such confidence but that just pissed me off more. I said to my mil I don't know who the fuck you think you are but that is MY daughter and my wife decided she will be  breast fed and if you don't agree with that get the fuck out"" I ripped ny daughter out of her arms 
 
My mother in law gave me a disgusted look as if I had called her every name under the sun

The first time I met her, she eyed me up and down like I was a sheep at the market. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs been courting my daughter? I hope you‚Äôre not planning on living off her good graces.‚Äù I barely managed a polite smile, already feeling the sweat trickle down my back.

Every Sunday, we‚Äôd go over to her house for dinner, and every Sunday, it was the same routine. My mil would critique my clothes, my job, and even the way I buttered my bread. ‚Äú are you sure you know how to do that? You‚Äôre making a right mess of it,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, as if I hadn‚Äôt been buttering bread my whole life.

One particular evening stands out in my memory. My wife and I had just announced that we were expecting our first child. I was over the moon, but my mils reaction was less than enthusiastic. ‚ÄúWell, I hope you‚Äôre ready for sleepless nights and dirty nappies. It‚Äôs not all fun and games, you know,‚Äù she said, with a stern look that could curdle milk.

As the months went by, her comments became even more frequent. ‚Äú do you really think you can handle being a father? You can barely keep the house in order!‚Äù she‚Äôd exclaim, shaking her head. I tried my best to stay patient, for my wifes sake, but it wasn‚Äôt easy.

When our little one finally arrived, I was determined to prove My mil wrong. I changed nappies, rocked the baby to sleep, and even managed to cook a few meals without burning them. But no matter what I did, it never seemed to be enough. ‚Äú, are you sure you‚Äôre holding the baby right? You don‚Äôt want to drop her,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, hovering over me like a hawk. She always wanted us to formula feed our daughter but my wife wanted to breast feed and her mother seemed to have a problem with that but she never said why 

One day, I‚Äôd had enough I walked into my daughters room and there was my mother in law givingbher formula i grabbed the bottle off her and asked her ""what the fuck she was doing"" i was trying to keep my cool ""why are you giving out daughter formula"" I said really pissed off ""my granddaughter needs to be on formula so I can take her to my house"" and sye said it in such confidence but that just pissed me off more. I said to my mil I don't know who the fuck you think you are but that is MY daughter and my wife decided she will be  breast fed and if you don't agree with that get the fuck out"" I ripped ny daughter out of her arms 
 
My mother in law gave me a disgusted look as if I had called her every name under the sun 

My mother in law just turned away and left 
My wife gave out to me telling me I was too harsh

Am I the asshole for finally snapping at my mother in law after she kept trying to micro manage my baby",0.0,0.04973049461841583,0,1
70,1deckcx,AITA for telling my BFF I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her,"So, for context. My bf and I have a rule that when we are actively watching a show or movie together we aren‚Äôt to be on our phones to avoid arguments or feeling like the other doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm also pregnant, and have had struggles with emotional regulation my whole life, even before the pregnancy hormones let alone now. I also had a slight scare in the very beginning of my pregnancy that the doctor said was most likely caused by stress. My bff is aware of ALL of that. 

This situation took place two days ago while watching Stranger Things with my bf. I saw my bff sent me multiple videos on Snapchat as well as a picture. That‚Äôs not uncommon at all, and the videos she sends she usually asks me to open alone. Plus I‚Äôm in the middle of watching this show. So I save the videos and picture so I can look at them later. And go back to the show

Eventually my bf goes to the bathroom. I take those few seconds he‚Äôs doing his business to go on Facebook and like and comment on a single status before he came back out and we returned to the show. 

When the show is over I excuse myself to our bedroom so I can finally look at the videos and picture my bff sent and she‚Äôs deleted them all. She‚Äôs done this before in the past when I wasn‚Äôt answering her in a time frame she felt was appropriate. So I assume she‚Äôs throwing a tantrum and message her saying ‚ÄúC‚Äômon dude. Don‚Äôt be weird. I wasn‚Äôt ignoring you, I was gunna look at everything once I had the chance‚Äù.

She immediately responds with a video back saying with a lot of attitude and vitriol that I‚Äôm a bad friend because the videos and picture she sent were of her daughter who‚Äôd been hurt and it was clear as day that‚Äôs what it was but I‚Äôd rather be on Facebook liking and commenting on statuses then caring to check up on her or her kid. I was immediately so hurt and triggered by this because she‚Äôs never talked to me like this before. And I‚Äôve been her best friend since we were 11 yo. I was there throughout her whole pregnancy. I even just attended her daughters prek grad and I bawled my eyes out cause I was so happy and proud. So I sent her a video back saying that I understood her being upset but I didn‚Äôt hurt her daughter, and her putting this on me wasn‚Äôt fair. I of course love her and her daughter but I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what had happened and her trying to make me feel bad for not answering her is cruel. I finished by telling her I was really hurt and I hope her daughter is okay but I don‚Äôt want to talk to her right now. 

My bff then proceeds to blow up my phone calling me non stop, texting me saying if I don‚Äôt answer her then she‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù with me. And she even left me a voicemail saying she doesn‚Äôt know who I am anymore cause me before pregnancy would never run away from communicating and run away from all my problems and no relationship of mine will ever work out if I act like this. I texted her saying she was being entitled expecting to talk to me with such disgust yet then wanting me to talk things out with her right away. I needed some time to calm down because I wanted to look at the situation clearly and not say things I didn‚Äôt mean. But a day later I still feel like I‚Äôm not in the wrong and I texted her saying if she wants to talk to let me know. And my bff says she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me now for a while because I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her right away. I said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not ready that‚Äôs fine just lmk when you ARE ready‚Äù.

71,1decjtt,WIBTA telling my dad he‚Äôs a coward for not telling me he got remarried?,"My (f23) dad (m51) recently got married again without telling me. My mom died last august from cancer and my dad started dating again this February. I was aware of the relationship (though my feelings have been mixed) and knew he was planning to get married again. Though when he originally told me he was seeing someone he did say that he had no plans of getting married again and that the woman he was seeing was an childhood friend (whom I‚Äôve never heard of) and that they were taking it slow. Around April he told me he was in love it her and that he was considering on getting married. He asked me then if I wanted to be there for the wedding in which I answered that I was not sure since I haven‚Äôt met the woman yet but that I would like to know when it was happening. 
In May after my college graduation he ambushed me at my brother‚Äôs with the woman so we could meet.  That interaction left me crying because he had dropped on my that he was moving in with her and that the wedding would be soon. 
Though I understand his need for a partner in life, I do not agree with the ways he‚Äôs been handling it. 
Today I finally asked my older brother if they had gotten married (because I had a gut feeling) and he admitted that they did. 
My issue is that he hasn‚Äôt even tried to discussed it with me at all. Not even a text message to let me know that he got married. Though I know overall this doesn‚Äôt affect me much since I am an adult now. I can‚Äôt help but to feel hurt by his sudden decisions in the last few months. My mom hasn‚Äôt even been gone a year and it feels that he‚Äôs already moving on while I am still grappling with the fact that she‚Äôs gone. 


Edit for more context. 
So some have made comments about the time I cried when I was forced to meet my dad‚Äôs new wife/fiancee. Let me set the stage, though my dad did say he would like to have me meet her after my graduation we never set a date (I was putting it off so I could prepare myself emotionally). He did messaged me during finals week that the day after my graduation he was going to have her meet one of my brothers (the one who knew) and his family. I left him on open cause at the time I was really busy and never committed on anything. When he did mentioned it again I told him that was also the day I was moving back from my college apartment (cause who wants to meet their dad‚Äôs new girlfriend after moving back from three hours away). I was also super emotional already having to go through graduation without my mom being there. She was my biggest supporter and proud of me for going to college (she was not able to). I had just got back from moving (my oldest brother helped me) and got a call from my other brother asking if we were back yet. We had told him we were unpacking the car and would call him back later. When we did we found out my dad was heading to the house (the house my parents lived in together). To avoid having to deal with them after a long day and emotional weekend we decided to go ahead to my other brother‚Äôs house. We were there for about thirty or so minutes before my dad and his girlfriend pulled up unannounced. I will admit I was surprised on just how hard it was seeing her but I tried to be as polite as I could to her. She congratulated me on graduation which I thanked her for and made a comment on how glad I was to be done. My dad asked me if I wanted to head down to her house for lunch the next day. I made an excuse saying I needed to renew my license and start unpacking so I could be ready for work. The plan was that my father and I would live in the mother-in-law suite that‚Äôs connected to the main house (he doesn‚Äôt like staying in the main house with mom gone). My eldest brother is in the process of buying the house from him now, his wife and him now live in the main house. I was supposed to take the smaller bed room that was used as a storage room by my mom so I was going to need to clean it out and go through all of her things. After making two excuses my dad pulled me to the front porch. He told me then that if I didn‚Äôt want to spend time with her I didn‚Äôt have to but if the reason was because of moving into the small room not to worry about it he‚Äôs moving out (first time he mentioned this). He continued saying that the wedding was being moved forward quicker than he originally told me (it wasn‚Äôt supposed to happened right away). I either said okay or just nodded (don‚Äôt really remember) but my facial expressions outed me for being upset. He immediately said that I wasn‚Äôt happy about it and asked why. I didn‚Äôt think it was the time or space (his girlfriend was literally inside) to have the discussion so I said I really don‚Äôt want to talk about it. He then tried to change the subject to my boyfriend (who‚Äôs the first one I‚Äôve had) which is when I actually started to cry and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk about that either. I walked away to my brothers who were standing outside around the truck drinking beer (it‚Äôs the south). I told them what happened while in tears. I cried because I was already having an emotional weekend and then forced to deal with another emotional situation without being prepared. My one of my sister-in-law walked out to check in on me and told me that my dad had asked if I had been dumped the minute he came inside. (Meaning he thought the reason I was crying was because I was going through a break up and it had nothing else to do with him). We went back inside after I calmed down a bit and said our goodbyes. Dad hugged me and said we would talk later. 
The later came a few days later when he was picking stuff up at the house. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a conversation since I really didn‚Äôt talk but the gist was that he understood I was upset but I shouldn‚Äôt be because nothing between us was changing that he was still taking care of me and was going to help with my student loans like he promised (will believe it when I see it). 
Talking to my dad had never been easy. He‚Äôs old school and growing up we were taught the mindset that children are to be seen and not heard. So even now that I am an adult it‚Äôs hard for me to communicate my feelings with him when feelings were seen as being weak or even disrespectful when I was growing up. It has led to me coping by internalizing all pain and emotion till I literally cannot hold it in anymore. (Which makes it worse I know and I have actually gotten a lot better). 
So for more context as to why only one brother knows while I and the eldest did not know about my dad is getting married. I think the biggest reason why is that that brother is my half brother (we don‚Äôt share a mom) and my dad felt like he wouldn‚Äôt care as much to him moving on fast. My dad also claims that I said I didn‚Äôt want to know after I said I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it at the first meeting (which I said I did wanted to when asked months ago). But if that‚Äôs really the case why did my eldest brother get left out. My eldest brother was my mom‚Äôs son from a previous marriage but my dad was the one who raised him and still calls him his son. 
It‚Äôs looking like my two kids (brother and sister) from his previous marriage is the only ones that knew he got married. Apparently this was weeks ago and the brother that knew told him I was asking about it. He was pushing my dad to tell me and he still didn‚Äôt.
I‚Äôm upset he didn‚Äôt tell me and I am trying to work through this new situation the best I can while I am still grieving. I understand it‚Äôs different for everyone and people move on at different times and moving on doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt love anymore but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair for me to ask for time instead of being pushed. I feel like the only reason my dad pushed us to meet her that day was so he could marry her with a clear conscience ‚Äúwell the kids did meet her‚Äù. It was apart of his check list basically. 
At this point I don‚Äôt want to get to know her or have a relationship because of my feelings with my dad being unsolved. In this moment she could be literally the best person in the world but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see that through my anger with my dad. It would be unfair of me to take that out on her when she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong. I‚Äôm trying to be an adult about this but being an adult doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings just go away.

72,1dechu1,AITA for Confronting My Sister About Her Hurtful Behavior During a Mental Health Episode?,"My (36M) sister (33F) struggles with mental illness. She‚Äôs been terribly abused by our mother, and she sometimes exhibits behavior that tell‚Äôs me that she struggles with delusions sometimes; says and believes things that are too out there. I think she was on meds for bipolar and suddenly went off of them.

Yesterday she started a fight with a lot of people seemingly out of nowhere that was triggered by my mom. She sent long texts to a lot of people saying really hurtful things. My sister believes she‚Äôs having an episode. I didn‚Äôt think so when I talked to her, I heard her out and everything seemed to track since my mom did and always has been digging at her with targeted remarks.

I heard her out, she calmed down, and everything seemed to be calming down. 
When I went home, I heard from my other sister, who‚Äôs living halfway across the world that she‚Äôd sent her a long text also saying unspeakably hurtful things. I totally understand where she‚Äôs coming from because I was once in the receiving end of these low blows.

Today as I was talking to her on the phone, I asked her what happened, and she says she‚Äôs always been victimized by our little sister and that what she said was nothing compared to what she‚Äôs been through. I told her that, to be honest, she can go a bit too far when she get‚Äôs angry, and that she could communicate in a better way. She said she had reached her limits and had let out all her hurt at once and that our little sister deserved to hear all those things. What scared me is her lack of remorse about it all. I asked how she can say such things and not feel about them one bit. How it doesn‚Äôt hurt her to have hurt her sister so much. She didn‚Äôt like that and hung up the phone on me.

She then called me back a few minutes later guns blazing starting a whole tirade. I hung up the phone before she could go any further. She tends to use whatsapp to send her attacks, so I blocked her there. When I called her again to give her a chance to be heard in a safe way, I realized she‚Äôd blocked me.

I know, under normal circumstances, it wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to bring attention to hurtful behavior, but I wonder if, given her mental state, when she needed to be validated and heard, I made feel attacked like everyone else. I was the only on her side, and now she has no one. I‚Äôm sure she feels betrayed. In her mind, I unfairly attacked her because her pain was just too big at the time. I realize it wasn‚Äôt the best time to do that, but I didn‚Äôt think it would escalate like that out of nowhere.

Now I feel like I‚Äôve failed her, and might have exacerbated her, possibly traumatic, episode. Her mental health issues are as severe due to the abuse she‚Äôs endured all her life. She needs to be loved and supported as much as possible. I feel like I‚Äôm not supporting her as she needs to be supported. That it was insensitive / cruel of me to call her out when she‚Äôs in such a fragile state. So, am I the asshole?

She then called me back a few minutes later guns blazing starting a whole tirade. I hung up the phone before she could go any further. She tends to use whatsapp to send her attacks, so I blocked her there. When I called her again to give her a chance to be heard in a safe way, I realized she‚Äôd blocked me.

I know, under normal circumstances, it wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to bring attention to hurtful behavior, but I wonder if, given her mental state, when she needed to be validated and heard, I made feel attacked like everyone else. I was the only on her side, and now she has no one. I‚Äôm sure she feels betrayed. In her mind, I unfairly attacked her because her pain was just too big at the time. I realize it wasn‚Äôt the best time to do that, but I didn‚Äôt think it would escalate like that out of nowhere.

Now I feel like I‚Äôve failed her, and might have exacerbated her, possibly traumatic, episode. Her mental health issues are as severe due to the abuse she‚Äôs endured all her life. She needs to be loved and supported as much as possible. I feel like I‚Äôm not supporting her as she needs to be supported. That it was insensitive / cruel of me to call her out when she‚Äôs in such a fragile state. So, am I the asshole? ",0.0,0.10556019842624664,0,1

AITA, for not inviting my sister to my wedding unless she wears a dress ? I (33m) am marrying next year. Me and my wife 33f are planning a big glamorous wedding and are very concerned about my sister's 27f,(I ll call her Mary) appearance to our wedding.

Mary doesn't want to wear a dress to my wedding,she is very firm about it and we ( my and my wife ) really dont want her to come unless she wears a dress.She says she would wear almost anything that I choose for her that she can afford as long that s not a dress or a skirt, but we think that it would be more appropriate to wear a dress in her case in our wedding. Not only she would look amazing and would end all the gossip.

More info: Mary is masculine. She is so male appearing that many people wouldn't tell she is a woman by looking at her or even having a small conversation with her.She has hormonal condition (CAH) and she naturally produces more testosterone. As a result,she has not feminine face features, she is hairy and she hasn t a feminine voice.All that wouldn't be a problem if she'd just dress more feminine but she chooses to dress and behave rather manly.

That was causes for people to talk behind her back and being mean to her. Although she is hurt by the comments, she makes NO EFFORT to change her appearance AT ALL in order to stop the mean comments and the gossip.She never wears makeup, she only wears jeans,t-shirts or suits,often has short hair and she is muscular, also,she is not so consistent with her hair removal, she says she forgets or doesnt have the money.When I suggest that she should be more feminine she wouldn't listen and she says she loves the way she looks and she can not understand why she should change it for others.

I love her and I hate seeing people treat her like that especially at my wedding, because in reality she is very beautiful. She has very attractive, angel like,features but because she uses no makeup and not taking care of herself because of her depression, no one could see that.

We want our wedding to be perfect, we have put so much money and effort into it and we don't want everyone to talk about my weird sister.

My sister agreed to shop for the wedding with a friend of mine to help her pick up an outfit but at her budget and her restrictions it would be a miracle to find something that she doesn't look underdressed or cheap ,but I can get her a nice dress on her budget and she would look amazing! My sister wouldn't wear it.She said she would feel awful and she couldn't stand it.She says that she sacrificed enough by agreeing not cutting her hair until the wedding and because she agreed to professional makeup, hairstyler,hair removal she shouldn't have to wear a dress.She says that I should meet her halfway and she called me an AH for pressure her too much.

I called her to check on her and she reassured me everything was okay just wants to be private.

I looked her account up and saw she was posting new things, I looked her new highlighted stories and saw she was selling my mom's things, she didn't pick up when I called her so I took screenshot and sent to her to call me.

Long story short, because B&C moved in with each other, I was labelled as codependent/jealous and ended up ending my side of the relationship. I was with Bailey for about three years and I was with Chris for about a year. B&C are still living together while I‚Äôve been at university. We decided to stay friends because it wasn‚Äôt a messy breakup, more that I needed to work on myself a bit. That's the basics of the situation. 

Things didn‚Äôt start to get iffy until about 8 months ago, when I noticed B&C were reluctant to hang out with me. Chris is unemployed and has been since I met them, while Bailey worked a 9-5.

79,1debyub,AITA for insisting my daughter take more driving lessons before her test.,"I have a daughter who is learning to drive. I have a friend of a relative who knows a good driving instructor who has offered to teach my daughter for free. He has previously taught my son for a well under market fee and was excellent.

However my daughter is the kind of person who always thinks expensive things are better and was unhappy from the start that I wasn't paying someone else.

She comes up with all kinds of excuses and unfairly criticizes and accuses the instructor of things.

For instance she has said the car is filthy when it isn't that bad, come back with gum in her hair and claimed he either put it there or it was in the car. Sometimes when the instructor is driving to show her things he accidentally touched her while changing gears and she claims it was on purpose. I told her to tell him you don't like that and she did and he said it was an accident since his other car is wider than the one he uses for lessons.

Then she also claimed he sometimes spits when he talks and that he shouts at her and said it was on purpose.

She dismisses his feedback and when he tells her that she didn't shoulder check or hesitated when changing lanes she claims he is lying.

I'll admit I know this person has a peculiar sense of humor different from my daughter but he means no harm and his heart is in the right place.

My daughter after driving for only 6 months (learning a stick shift) says she wants to take the test to get it over with. However I asked her instructor and he says she should practice for a couple more months as she lacks confidence.

My daughter is now upset with me as she is confident she can pass but I feel she just wants to stop the lessons. And even if she somehow passes, I do feel that more practice makes sense and will help her.

For instance she has said the car is filthy when it isn't that bad, come back with gum in her hair and claimed he either put it there or it was in the car. Sometimes when the instructor is driving to show her things he accidentally touched her while changing gears and she claims it was on purpose. I told her to tell him you don't like that and she did and he said it was an accident since his other car is wider than the one he uses for lessons.

Then she also claimed he sometimes spits when he talks and that he shouts at her and said it was on purpose.

She dismisses his feedback and when he tells her that she didn't shoulder check or hesitated when changing lanes she claims he is lying.

I'll admit I know this person has a peculiar sense of humor different from my daughter but he means no harm and his heart is in the right place.

My daughter after driving for only 6 months (learning a stick shift) says she wants to take the test to get it over with. However I asked her instructor and he says she should practice for a couple more months as she lacks confidence.

My daughter is now upset with me as she is confident she can pass but I feel she just wants to stop the lessons. And even if she somehow passes, I do feel that more practice makes sense and will help her. While I haven't seen her drive since I don't trust her with my car yet, I do believe the instructor and trust him in this regard especially with all the experience he has.",1.0,1.045738935470581,1,1

82,1debn13,AITA for getting in touch with a friend who is in a relationship,"F(early 20s). I have a friend I know since we met at Uni, but ended up not going to the same class after a while.

We would still hang out sometimes and text each other.  
He's a very specific personality and annoying, but it's part of his charm.

I met his girlfriend a while back, they are together for some time now. I can't tell if my friend is that into her in a serious way, or she was just something unusual and new. Whenever I ask him about her or their relationship, he only kind of says it's all fine. Some time after I met her, she started acting off and jealous, she pretty much told me so when we talked just the two of us, while I was still in the country.

I get her insecurity. She is older than my friend and at her age it's already late to still be just dating, especially someone my friend's age and expect that it has a future. She was upset because she has some insecurity about how I talk to and look at my friend, although we always have been just friends, and even though he is a good guy and partner material I would never really say he's my type.

I told her all this and that she shouldn't worry, but that she doesn't have the time to not have it figured out if this is what she wants and if this relationship is for someone like her. She said that me always contacting him makes her uncomfortable.

I was in relationships since knowing my friend, so I don't get the big deal really. I am abroad for master studies, and ever since I don't get to really even see or talk to him much. He has this thing where he changes phone numbers so he is sometimes not easy to get a hold of, but I still try to catch up and see how he is doing.

I think she's still the same, because I got in touch with him recently and even though he doesn't not want to talk to me, he does seem a little bit distant.   
He always made it clear that he doesn't like clingy or jealous or girly girls, so it's probably because of her that he is kind of off like this.

She told me she was autistic and now I'm wondering if her overreactions about me are just usual insecure girl drama that she passes off as autism, because then maybe he just feels bad about leaving her. He doesn't seem happy. That kind of thing wears him down. 

My mom loves him, he was there for my graduation, but somehow he got colder after his girlfriend's moods hit.  
He was always the hot and cold kind of guy, even with me, but that's just what it's like being friends with him. He is like that with his girlfriend apparently too so maybe she doesn't like it, but that's no reason to be less talkative with me even than usual.

I think she is using autism as some excuse for being over the top about me contacting him, and I am even wondering if I should try to influence him to realize he is keeping himself trapped with her and move him towards getting the courage to just leave her. But if I try that, she will find a way to make it look like it means she was right and somehow I want him.

84,1deb6ac,AITA for asking my brother to save $400 for a plane ticket to my wedding in 3 months ,"Context: I 23 (M) am getting married at the end of September to my fianc√© (23F) in a state (USA) 2 states away. My engagement was in may and we‚Äôre having the wedding early for a family member who may not live long enough to attend if we planned the wedding any further.
 My brother (23) is PO due to the wedding being so early (three months) and says it‚Äôs unrealistic for him and my other siblings to fly out to attend. I‚Äôve offered to pay half the flight $200 usd  and pay for food lodging etc. he‚Äôs fought back saying he won‚Äôt be attending due his bills being too high. The man doesn‚Äôt drive doesn‚Äôt pay utilities and has a job which pays almost twice what I do this may sound selfish but when I explained to him how he could save money or pick up a side job like DoorDash since it doesn‚Äôt require having a car as he said he couldn‚Äôt get more hours at his job, I got pissed off that he wasn‚Äôt going to attempt to be there and he left the family chat and blocked all most social media. This is where things get fun. After the initial conversation I‚Äôve learned from one of his coworkers that he‚Äôs actively giving away hours to help his ‚Äúsick grandparents‚Äù and hasn‚Äôt been working weekends for quite a few weeks now. When confronted about this I asked him why I haven‚Äôt heard about our grandparents being sick he dodged the question, he got defensive and said he won‚Äôt be coming to the wedding and I‚Äôm being insensitive to his financial situation and that I have unrealistic expectations for my family to attend. 

Aftermath: my brother and most of my mom‚Äôs side of the family plans on not coming due to funds despite my willingness to rent hotels pay for planes and food. I‚Äôve been labeled as the bad guy and now my wedding will only have 3 members of my family my father and my two ‚Äúsick‚Äù grandparents. Am I wrong for being upset? AITA? 

More context: he‚Äôs openly admitted to having roughly the same debt I have and I‚Äôve learned he went from 40hrs a week to 30hrs willingly and he makes roughly ~$20hr plus tips.

TL:DR my brother turned half my family against me over a $400 plane ticket despite me offering to pay for the trip and all amenities that would be required.

85,1deb3ds,AITA for asking my sister to move out of my house?,"More than a decade ago a new job took me (now 45F) to another state. At the time, my younger sister (now 33) was living with me in a home i'd bought a 4 years earlier, paying minimal rent. I asked if she wanted to ""rent"" the entire house at cost while I figured out what I wanted to do with it (didn't know if it would be long-term, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to sell right away and renting to strangers seemed intimidating).

She agreed, but was in school for teaching and couldn't afford the entire bill, so she lived there for more than a year paying well under the taxes/mortgage. She eventually got on more even footing and started paying the full cost, but there have been times over the years when the rent will be late or not the full rent for various reasons.

Time, kids, job changes, and the pandemic happened, and now 10 years have passed. My sister is still paying the same amount even as rents have boomed; she's paying more than $1K under market rent. In the meantime, lots of stuff on the property is needing repairs/replacement, some of it really expensive. I know this is necessary for the upkeep of the home, but typically repair costs can be covered by rent income, at least to a degree, and not my personal emergency fund.

Simply put, the maintenance costs are feeling unsustainable and I want to sell or rent out the property at market rent with a management company (if I sold it, my equity in a savings account would bring in $8K - $10K per year, so I'm leaving lots of money on the table). The problem is both that my sister has said she thinks it is wrong to ""profit"" off of family, and that her credit isn't great and she thinks she will have trouble moving out.

I could see letting her stay if she could pay closer to market rate (on the low end). I wouldn't gouge her but I'd like to be able to build up an emergency fund to handle repairs at the very least.

In theory I'd love to be able to continue to help out family, but I didn't sign on with a plan to subsidize her lifestyle forever.

87,1deatgd,AITA for not supporting my mums new relationship? ,"Hello everyone, I am a long time lurker and am just looking for some advice about this. 

Backstory: my mum (51f) got diverced from my(27f) dad when I was 2ish due to infidelity on his end. She then met my stepdad(now 41m) when I was 4 who raised me for most of my life. Their relationship ended due to mental health problems on his end and amicably split 10 years ago, and are still good friends to this day. He has gone on to have 2 more children so there is no chance of them getting bak together, they are better as friends anyway! Me and my mum have a very rocky relationship, I brought up my sister(17f) for the past 10 years as my mum worked away, and doesn‚Äôt see that I carried the household on my shoulders and that I missed out on a lot in my early 20‚Äôs. 

Fast forwards to last year she flew to Egypt for a holiday with my sister where she met a man out there (I think he‚Äôs in his 30‚Äôs?). She has only met him face to face for roughly 6 weeks in total with her flying back to Egypt twice since. They have spoken continuously for the past year. She last flew out a couple of weeks ago and has come home saying they are going to get married so he can come live with her in England. 

Now I normally don‚Äôt care what my mum does but she will be moving this man into a household with my younger sister and grandma who is quite frail at the moment from a number of falls. 

But my issues with this relationship is:
- I have not spoken to this man even over FaceTime 
- She hasn‚Äôt told my grandma he is coming and that they are getting married. 
- He has shouted at her when she‚Äôs flown out to him for stepping into the bathroom with the wrong foot and singing whilst in the bathroom. 

I am worried that he is going to take advantage of her and just simply use her for her money and citizenship! 

My mum isn‚Äôt happy that I don‚Äôt support this and doesn‚Äôt bring it up around me. And has called me an ahole for not supporting her with this and giving my blessing. 

But I am worried I am being to harsh about this and not supporting her. So aita for not supporting this?

My roommate works from home. Their office is in our den but they regularly work from the couch in our living room or their bedroom.

I work at the office every day but occasionally, maybe once every 2 months, work from home. On those days my roommate and I watch tv together.

I'm coming down with a cold and asked my roommate if I can have unfettered access to the TV if I need to take a sick day this week.

They said no and were very annoyed and unsympathetic that I would even ask because that's their office. I reminded them their office is our den and we only have 1 living room. I said that everyone else who works from the office gets to enjoy rot days when they're sick and it doesn't feel fair that I have to share, especially when they don't have to share on their sick days.

We're going on a trip for two weeks starting this weekend but I explained that I wont be sick next week and we'd be having the same argument if they weren't going on a trip. They also mentioned how we're moving soon to a bigger place which will likely have multiple living rooms but that doesn't change the fact I'm asking for a day this week, in our 1 livingroom apartment.

We also share the tv on the days after work where we're all home. They regularly go out with their partner or mom and on those days I have the tv to myself but that's not whats being discussed. We are discussing sick days.

I get 5 days a year where I can be home and rot. Everyday I get up, shower and commute to and from work.

90,1deahb1,AITA for changing my grown son‚Äôs room into a room for my granddaughter?,"I have 2 kids: Kathy (29F) and Michael (25M). Kathy lives with me , pays a portion of the bills and has no plans on moving out anytime soon. We have our own business that we operate out of our home. It‚Äôs easier for her to live here and it‚Äôs great because I have help with the bills. Whereas, Michael lives about an hour away for work and has his own apartment. For awhile, I kept Michael‚Äôs room as is. He‚Äôs shared several times he has no plans of moving back home as his job is in the city he moved to.

Kathy had a very close friend who has a 2 year old daughter, Zoey. Friend named Kathy her daughter‚Äôs godmother as well as guardian should she pass. Unfortunately, that happened 6 months ago. Kathy‚Äôs friend was a single mom, so Kathy was granted custody. At first, Zoey was sharing a room with Kathy as she had extreme separation anxiety. However, she‚Äôs now ready for her own room. As our home is a 3 bedroom. We don‚Äôt have anywhere else to put her.

When I told Michael what we were doing, I said I‚Äôd get a pull out for the living room or I could get a daybed for my room when he visits overnight for holidays. I know rooming with your mom isn‚Äôt fun, but I want to give him options. 

He‚Äôs mad that I gave the room to Zoey. He says that was his room. I said I understand but he doesn‚Äôt live with me. Kathy does and pays bills. She‚Äôs even paying more now because she feels she‚Äôs using more resources with Zoey living with us. I‚Äôd feel different if Kathy and Zoey were moving out soon but they‚Äôre not. At this point, Kathy plans to adopt Zoey. I want to help her. My mom helped me raise my kids, her mom helped her, it‚Äôs in our culture to have a multigenerational household. 

Moving isn‚Äôt an option. I can make the space more private for Michael when he spends the night (a divider in the living room). But as he usually only sleeps her 2 or 3 times a year, it just doesn‚Äôt feel practical. 

I said if Michael ever needed to move home permanently, we‚Äôd make something work. And I‚Äôd also help him with his child if he was in this situation. He says he doesn‚Äôt want kids. I said that‚Äôs fine but this is the situation at this moment.

Am I (24) the A-hole for telling my Husband (26) that I am giving him 4 months to get things in order for us to move out of his parents house that we have been living with for 8 months now.
To put things in context my husband and I had an emergency situation when I had my baby the last week we had our lease for our previous apartment. The only option we had for a roof over our head was to live in the In-Laws home, have an Aunt and Uncle hold on to my cat since in-laws have a cat attacking dog, and our dog had to permanently be outside.
Our dogs in the beginning got along perfectly, but it escalated slowly and surely to the point where the brutal attacks they would get into every day multiple times a day would end up with both of them bloody and scarred. It ended up with me convincing the mother in law to keep their dog indoors like she previously was and keeping the dogs absolutely no contact. Any time they are both outdoors, our dog is in the crate and there are covers over it so that they can‚Äôt even see each other. However whenever she is in the crate she thinks that she is going to be left in there and goes manic. This makes the in-laws angry with her because of the noise, so they sometimes will leave her in there for even longer and continually yell at her to stop and use the beep/vibrate/shock collar on her (both dogs have one).
The other night our dog was panic barking, and father in law used the collar to get her to be quiet, but when he did her barks changed and she cowered underneath the mat in her crate. Which is extremely unusual for her to ever do. He might have accidentally hit the shock, but we don‚Äôt know.
On top of it the in laws are decent people, but they drink often. The father in law is a nice drunk, but he won‚Äôt say the nicest things. Almost nightly he will tell me about our dog
 ‚ÄúEcho, I love ya; but I hate ya.‚Äù 
‚ÄúDog if you were out on the farm, you would be on the farm for long‚Äù (meaning that he thinks that she is smart but disobedient to the point where she would be put down)
Every time he says it, it breaks my heart and a spark of rage is lit in me.
On top of it I have been working on training her for months and working on understanding how she works best with discipline, but he will try to discipline her and train her in his own way which undoes the trust I‚Äôve built with her. Then he‚Äôll turn to me and say,‚Äù Well she‚Äôs your dog, and you guy‚Äôs have your way of training her. It‚Äôs not the way I would have done it‚Ä¶But.‚Äù
Long story short to say that I snapped after the crate cowering incident and told my Husband that I‚Äôm absolutely done with all of this and that I‚Äôm giving us four months maximum to get out of here. It‚Äôs for the safety of our little family, and I know that it‚Äôs a matter of time until one of the dogs gets aggressive with us or turns it towards our eight month old baby. ( both dogs individually are absolutely amazing with the baby, but when the in-laws start yelling at their dog I can tell that she is barely holding her herself together).
I feel bad for pushing this all so directly to my husband because he is always working a hard and crappy job and has to come home to quite literally holding the in-laws together with every little situation. But we both agree that we can‚Äôt continue with this in our family. We thought we would only be here for a month, but now it‚Äôs eight months.

94,1dea9n7,WIBTA if I tell my friend to stop seeing this guy?,"I have this friend in my class. She's 17 and we're to graduate high school later this year. We don't talk about our love lives much at all, but from what I've heard she's been talking to this guy on Instagram. I didn't care much to begin with. She's a 17-year-old girl, course she's gonna be talking to guys and looking for a boyfriend.

But then, the other day when we were just hanging out, I randomly decided to ask her what's the oldest she'd be willing to go out with. Her answer was that it was complicated, because the guy she was talking with was about 5 years older than her. Meaning, this is a 17-year-old who's been talking with some dude in his 20s. And earlier today I overheard her say that she went out to watch a movie with this guy and that he kissed her a few times.

As someone who ""dated"" someone 5 years older than them when they were still a minor, I'm worried that she seems to be in a somewhat similar situation, and I'm worried this might end badly for her. I really want to tell her to stop seeing this guy for her own good, but I keep thinking she might get upset with me for butting in and getting involved in something that's none of my business, or that she might think I'm underestimating her ability to make good decisions and think I know better than she does.

Obviously she was devastated when we told her the news but she was more hysterical over the fact she was ending treatment which yes is sad but it is her choice. Come to the planning of the funeral.

98,1de9iq9,AITA for wanting my husband to breathe through his mouth?,"Little bit of context for what I‚Äôm about to write, firstly I am very sleep deprived from inconsistent sleep due to a number of factors but the main one being my husband‚Äôs snoring.

We‚Äôve been together for a long time (10yrs ish) and my husband never used to snore. Over the last year he has put on a lot of weight (to which he is now technically overweight) and has made him start to snore. I don‚Äôt particularly care about the weight gain except for the fact he complains about it but refuses to change his eating habits or do any exercise but that‚Äôs besides the point.

Since he has started snoring it has started to affect my sleep but also our kids (young kids who wake up screaming when his snoring sounds demonic, and yes it sounds like a demon on crack sometimes). He has flat out refused to use a sleep apnoea machine, says it will interrupt his sleep (ironic much?) but I noticed one day when he was sleeping and his nose was so blocked he was forced to breathe through his mouth‚Ä¶

And the snoring stopped!!!


I told my husband this discovery but he REFUSES to breathe through his mouth. Says it makes his life more difficult as if his snoring isn‚Äôt the bloody problem! It‚Äôs to the point where I will keep waking him up when it gets ridiculously loud.

I wear ear plugs, have music going, I have even slept on our uncomfortable couch to try and get away from it but I can‚Äôt keep stuffing my neck up because he doesn‚Äôt want to help me in the slightest.

Anyway, am I the arsehole for wanting him to breathe through his mouth so we can all actually sleep?

99,1de9gy6,AITA for wanting tv time between me and my brother to be proportionate?,"So I 22m live in an apartment with my brother Jake 26m. I have been dating my gf Lora 19f for 2 years and I've lived in this apartment the entire time we've been together. Lora doesn't live with me, but she stays over at my apartment in my room multiple nights a week and we usually watch tv in the living room before bed. We usually use the tv at night around 4 nights per week. Jake never really used the tv and would usually just use his laptop in his room to watch something on a streaming service, so this worked out before.

Jake has recently started dating Mara 30f. She was fine and got along with me and Lora so I never minded her coming over to hang out with Jake. One night, I got home with Lora and we were gonna watch tv, but Mara and Jake were already using it. This was annoying, but I didn't say anything and we just went to my room. The next day, I got home from work and Jake was watching tv again with Mara. I didn't want this to be an argument later or a reoccurring issue so I told Jake we needed to discuss sharing the tv and he agreed.

Later that night, I told Jake that splitting the tv was fine, but I think that I should get to use it 3-4 days per week and he should get it 1-2 because I've been with Lora longer and we've been doing that to spend time together for our whole relationship so it's more important. Jake got mad at me and said this is unreasonable and that I can't expect him to still just use his laptop in his room because it's smaller and more uncomfortable for two people. I explained that me and Lora's history was the only reason for this and it wasn't to make him feel like I was pulling rank and that if they were together for longer it would allot more time (in my opinion). He just left and went to his room and I didn't see him again.

After this I noticed he was rarely home in the evenings anymore. He usually came back later to go to bed and Mara was never with him. After a week of this I asked why he never was home and he explained that he spends most of his time at Mara's place. I asked why and he said that I am annoying and entitled and it's not worth the petty arguments. I asked for examples and he mentioned the tv along with other things, but mainly discussed the tv.

103,1de8lwu,AITA for getting upset and starting an argument with my bf for going to a classmates birthday? ,"My bf (18 M) went to his friends (18 F) birthday after I (17 now 18 F) asked him not to go. The reason being when our classmate, who I'll call Sara, started inviting people she was a bit off when referring to me. 

To better explain Sara has a large circle of friends and my bf is semi in that friend group, I am not. I at the time was okay with this. Until the invitation sending part came out. While for the other friends she simply sent messages online when it came to my bf she sat next to him (I was also next to him) and asked him to go. I was okay with the lack of hi or hello since we aren't really that close but she kept glancing over at me. I just went on my phone to avoid the awkwardness. I finally looked up because it went silent and Sara was looking at me. She laughed and said ""What will you do with her?"" The 'joke' caught me off guard and I looked for some sort of reaction from my bf but he started laughing with her. I felt out of place. 

The next day I asked my bf if he was going.  He said yes if I allowed him. I said it's up to him but I'd really prefer if he didn't go because she was rude to me. He laughed and said she wasn't being rude and that was just her personality. I got annoyed with him and didn't talk to him for a while. 

About two weeks before her birthday he told me he wouldn't go. I was relieved and told him I was glad he wouldn't go after she was acting so off. 

Then it was the day before the birthday. And a mutual friend told me my bf was going and she knew because he was still in the group chat where they were planning how to get there and designated drivers and such. I was shocked and asked him immediately. He said he changed his mind impulsively and was going. 

Later on I figured out it wasn't an impulsive decision because he had bought a new formal shirt for the birthday (the birthday was the kind where the guests had a specific color palette) and I knew the color of his shirt which isn't a normal/typical color of dress shirt to get especially for him. And I knew he bought that shirt weeks prior. 

I was already annoyed by all of this but then it got way worse when I found out my bf got drunk and went home at four in the morning. And that he had slept at her house for most of the night only going home after his friends took pictures of him and sent them to me. 

When he sobered up the next day I was annoyed and upset about him lying to me and sleeping at her house despite having a designated driver. I started an argument and he got upset and we didn't talk for a while. This happened a while ago but I really think that i was in the right to be upset. So I'm wondering was I an asshole?

My bf (18 M) went to his friends (18 F) birthday after I (17 now 18 F) asked him not to go. The reason being when our classmate, who I'll call Sara, started inviting people she was a bit off when referring to me. 

To better explain Sara has a large circle of friends and my bf is semi in that friend group, I am not. I at the time was okay with this. Until the invitation sending part came out. While for the other friends she simply sent messages online when it came to my bf she sat next to him (I was also next to him) and asked him to go. I was okay with the lack of hi or hello since we aren't really that close but she kept glancing over at me. I just went on my phone to avoid the awkwardness. I finally looked up because it went silent and Sara was looking at me. She laughed and said ""What will you do with her?"" The 'joke' caught me off guard and I looked for some sort of reaction from my bf but he started laughing with her. I felt out of place. 

The next day I asked my bf if he was going.  He said yes if I allowed him. I said it's up to him but I'd really prefer if he didn't go because she was rude to me. He laughed and said she wasn't being rude and that was just her personality. I got annoyed with him and didn't talk to him for a while. 

About two weeks before her birthday he told me he wouldn't go. I was relieved and told him I was glad he wouldn't go after she was acting so off. 

Then it was the day before the birthday. And a mutual friend told me my bf was going and she knew because he was still in the group chat where they were planning how to get there and designated drivers and such. I was shocked and asked him immediately. He said he changed his mind impulsively and was going. 

Later on I figured out it wasn't an impulsive decision because he had bought a new formal shirt for the birthday (the birthday was the kind where the guests had a specific color palette) and I knew the color of his shirt which isn't a normal/typical color of dress shirt to get especially for him. And I knew he bought that shirt weeks prior. 

I was already annoyed by all of this but then it got way worse when I found out my bf got drunk and went home at four in the morning. And that he had slept at her house for most of the night only going home after his friends took pictures of him and sent them to me. 

When he sobered up the next day I was annoyed and upset about him lying to me and sleeping at her house despite having a designated driver. I started an argument and he got upset and we didn't talk for a while. This happened a while ago but I really think that i was in the right to be upset. So I'm wondering was I an asshole?

107,1de75vm,AITA for asking my BIL why he went to his half siblings for money when he knows they'd never help him?,"My sister Faye (29f) is married to Jared (30m). As long as we've known Jared we knew he had half siblings who had no relationship with him. He was open with us about his father having an affair that he was the result of and the kids from his father's marriage not liking him. He also mentioned that when his father passed, because he was still married to their mother (only legally, apparently they no longer lived together and Jared's parents were in a relationship), he inherited nothing from his father and suing did not help either. Jared was about 13 or something when his father died. His contact with his half siblings was basically over once his father had passed. But he was aware their mom had given them the money from their father and Jared was upset his half siblings didn't offer him anything from it since he was also their father's son.

Over the years he has brought this up on occasion and has expressed some hurt but also some anger that he was shunned and cut out and treated like he wasn't also his father's son by his father's other children.

I bring all this up because of the conflict between us. So Jared and Faye had some money issues and it was a stress. It's dealt with now. But Jared mentioned two weeks ago that he had tracked down his half siblings to ask if they would be willing to help him out given he never got anything from their late father and seeing as he is their sibling. Needless to say, they made it very clear he was not getting a single dollar from them. Which came as no surprise to me when he said it. But he was so shocked and I guess angry about it. He rambled on for a bit and I asked him why he went to them for money when he knew they'd never help him in a million years. He flew off the handle and told me to stop being such an ass and I have no idea what it's like being him. Faye tried to settle him but he said I was being a rude jackass and judging him for being a decent person. He demanded an apology and ever since then he's been demanding apologies from me for being so negative to him.

I'm genuinely confused by his actions but maybe I was TA to ask?

In summary: My brother (20M) and I (25F) live with our mom, while my sister (40F) lives with her spouse and their son (14M). My brother, sister, and I, all work for the same company, so she gives us a ride to work every morning.

Additionally, my sister gives us a ride back. My sister and I come out at 4:30pm and my brother comes out at 5:30pm.

My mom also sends her food she cooks for her family, since my sister ends up arriving home around 6:00pm.Things have been this way for about 2 months now.

3. It is not my sister's responsibility to help walking our dogs.

Lastly I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a physiological thing but the scent of weed just irritates my nose inside my nostrils.

I was so mad I went up and knocked pretty hard on his door (but not hard to break anything just enough to know I‚Äôm pissed) and as soon as he opened the door it was obvious that he‚Äôd been smoking inside his room. I told him that I will not tolerate this and that we discussed about him smoking away from our apartment.

Last thing I want to add on is that I‚Äôve already had a roommate before who smoked a crap ton of weed before and I let him keep pushing my boundaries and it got to the point where the apartment smelled liked weed 24/7 and he would always smoke outside on the porch which would still stink up the place.

114,1de5yq4,AITA For wanting my grandma's kitchenaid?,"My (20f) newest hyperfixation has been baking, more specifically, baking bread. However, the past few times i've made it, i've been using my hands, and anyone who has made bread knows that the dough ends up inconsistent, weirdly shaped, and it's never kneaded enough, making it sort of dense and lacking flavor (because science, in case you don't know). So, I expressed interest in a Kitchenaid mixer.

The first issue arose when my boyfriend (21m) mentioned we have a mixer. And technically, we have two. One is a hand mixer, which isn't really used for making doughs. Especially heavy ones like bread dough, as it could overheat the mixer, break the attachments, etc. The other mixer is very old, and basically a glorified hand mixer we got from his mom that she got from her grandma (his great grandma) from the 70's (i think, based on the model, Sunbeam, but regardless, VERY old). It's a cool vintage knick-knack, but I'd never want to use it for cooking.

I tried explaining this to him, but he wasn't understanding my concerns, so I let it go, and asked my Mom if my grandma's old mixer was in the market for pickup.

Here's where I may be the asshole:

My grandma died in 2018, for context, yes it's been 6 years, but there's still some of her things in my grandpa's house, as she died when I was 14, so a lot of things I didn't have a use for until years later, i.e. her car, jewelry, and now her kitchenaid mixer.

My boyfriend and I have lived together for a year, and we recently got a shelf that the mixer would definitely have a home on. I suggested getting the mixer and he declined, saying since we had the space, we should get a new, bigger model.

The models have not changed since my grandma bought hers, it would be free, it has the attachments i would need, and even if a few were lost or broken, it would only be a $50-$100 attachment instead of a $400-$500 mixer, sans attachments.

I told him it would be a waste of money and space, but he insisted that it would be a better purchase since it would for sure last longer. He then brought up his great grandmother's mixer again, claiming that if I wanted an older mixer, we already had one.

I tried explaining again, but he didn't want to hear it. If I didn't want to use his great grandma's mixer; why should I get my grandma's mixer? I understand his attachment to the mixer, but he's never used it. I don't think it's been used since his great grandmother. And the one i would be getting is the mixer I learned to bake with. And to be clear, I'm not suggesting getting rid of his great grandma's mixer.

Am I the Asshole for wanting my grandmother's kitchenaid mixer, and not using the one we have?

Update:

Thank you everyone for the puns and the advice. A lot of people were asking if I explained it to him, and yes, I really tried to. Showing him how tough bread dough is to knead, taking a normal whisk and trying to mix dough with it, etc.
Safe to say- he didn't understand why I still wanted it because ""we have the sunbeam"".
Whatever. I want my rightful Kitchenaid.

I went to my grandfather's house last night, and mentioned the kitchenaid. He was ecstatic that I was ready to take it (frees up some space in his dining room hutch, where it's been freeloading the past six years), and he even offered me her bread machine!

Needless to say, I'm taking both when we have dinner with him next week, and my boyfriend is none the wiser.

117,1de483y,AITA for not being sensitive to my former roommate‚Äôs text?,"I (29 m) and my former roommate (29 m) had a falling out in 2022. 

Background:
We were homies in high school. We went separate directions after. I went to college and he joined the army. We started hangout again in 2017 after he came back home. I got a job in 2017 at a car manufacturer. He got the same job in 2019. He walked off the job 3 months in and had trouble keeping a job but I would help him out with money. 

Living situation:
In 2021 he was rehired for a higher salary at the same car manufacturer he quit. We had a 70 minute commute from our city and decided to move closer. We signed a 15 month lease for a 2 bed apartment which cost $2800 total. He would not do his dishes or clean the kitchen after using it. Would use food coma as the excuse. Leave the living room messy and with trash everywhere. He trauma dumped about the past everyday and was crying over spilt milk. He walked off his job at the car manufacturer again. He became a full time student and used his GI Bill to pay for rent. 

Fallout:
We go out for a guys night out. We are checking out girls from across the bar like a normal guys night out without being too loud or obvious. I say ‚Äúdamn she‚Äôs fine as fuck bro‚Äù to him. He makes a comment about my relationship. ‚ÄúIf you ever say that in front of your fianc√©, I don‚Äôt want to have to get involved. I have respect for women because I have sisters and a mother.‚Äù 

Moving out:
Months 5 of 15 on the lease, he tells me he can‚Äôt keep a 4.0 gpa as a full time student. He tells me he will go part time to keep his 4.0 and can‚Äôt use his GI bill and will move back with his parents because he‚Äôs now broke. He offered to find me a replacement roommate off the web but we both had agreement to not live with strangers. I agree to pay his his half of rent. He leaves his room and bathroom a mess. Takes the tv stand that was being used to give to a relative in a different household. I now pay $2800 month for the remainder of lease .

Present :
I text him last year to check on his mental health. But no reply. That‚Äôs ok. he texts me this last Sunday. My coworker tells me I should be more careful from how I text him because he thinks he has severe mental health problems.

118,1de3qin,AITA for being uncomfortable with how well my gf and girl best friend get along?,"I (22M) have been friends with Katie (22F) since our first year of college. She is a great girl, really chill and down to earth. We hang out often and do things most women I date aren't into (e.g watching South Park). Ig bc of this bond most of the girls I've dated dislike Katie and become resentful of the time we spend together even though she's a lesbian and not a romantic option. 

I started dating Penny (20F) around 6 months ago and she felt the same way towards Katie. She told me she didn't like how much time I spend with Katie vs her, didn't feel included when we all hung out together, and thought Katie was too quiet. Katie could tell Penny was not keen on her. I asked them both to REALLY make an effort to become friends, for me. It slowly got a bit better.

A few weeks ago, Katie invited Penny to come with some other girls on a weekend art trip (my college has societies that do this). It was an olive branch and I encouraged Penny to take it. When they got back they were laughing and grinning together. Katie personally dropped Penny off at my flat, they hugged, and after she left Penny talked for an hour about how she had such a good time and that she hadn't realised how funny Katie was until now. I tried to point out that this is what I had been telling her but she kept going on about how nice Katie was and specifically how great it was to be JUST THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER.

Since the trip Katie and Penny have been meeting up 2-4 times a week to hang out. They do things like go on walks to sketch and attend local gigs, and only invite me half of the time. When it is the three of us they usually end up giggling together at stuff I've said and when I try to make inside jokes with Katie like we used to she makes it awkward by explaning the joke to Penny or just ignoring it. It's gotten to the point that they will make comments about stuff I do (leaving my laundry on the floor, trying to 'mansplain' things to them) and giving eachother knowing looks. It's like they have a new secret language they are using against me.

I know that I was originally the one who wanted them to have a friendship, but now I'm starting to regret it and wish things were back to the way they were before. I will ask Katie to hang out and she will often say she's already agreed to do something with Penny that day. When I'm with Penny she will show me memes Katie has sent her. When they hang out without me I feel like they are spending time mocking me.

Also, Penny is bisexual. She told me she has never been with another woman but my mind is filling with possibilities. What if Penny wants to explore her sexuality with Katie?

120,1de3hti,AITA for leaving my best friend while on vacation together?,"I very well may be an asshole, but how do I redeem myself?

I'd planned this vacation initially for my birthday (23F) back in April and invited my best friend, let's call her Luna (23F), when the original invitees couldn't make it. I had a loose itinerary for the 5 days we'd be at this island for the first time, but booked an island tour for the last day.

Luna booked a flight (she lives in a different city) and I met with her after traveling via land. Shortly after, we realized that the DIY land tour that we wanted to try was too expensive, so from that point on we improvised. Or tried to.

I matched with Nico on the second day, who asked me on a date for the next day, before Luna and I hit the club of the day, and then the after party, and then the after after party. I let Luna know I was leaving with a guy, making it back to our accommodation at around 5AM.

Later when I woke up, I loosely suggested we could meet later tonight for another night of partying as my date was at 2:30PM and Luna helped me get ready for it. I lost track of time and only made it back at around 2AM. I'd completely failed to update Luna on my whereabouts.

This is when I assume it all went to shit. Luna was getting up as I got back and the vibes were already off. No questions, no hype. I asked if she wanted to do anything later, if she had any plans or something. I told her that I could just set an alarm or she could wake me up because I was okay with that, and I also told her that Nico was planning on taking me out again to go up north. Luna didn't really give a solid answer so I went to bed and set my alarm anyway. I wake up to my alarm at around 8AM and find her gone. No message, no note.

So we spent our fourth day on the island mostly apart until dinner. My birthday dinner, which Luna had suggestions and would pay for. I asked her if I should leave Nico, as I was with him since 3PM, and have him pick me up after our dinner, but she said him dropping me off and picking me up seems a bit much and that he could come. We went to the first place she suggested because it was the closest to where we were at, except I didn't know it was a fine dining-esqe situation. When the bill came, Nico had his wallet out but Luna insisted on paying. Turns out we went overbudget (because there was a third person, she tells me later).

Then we partied, Nico bought us drinks, and I left with him. Came home around 6AM. The island tour pick up was at 7AM and only when our ride was there did Luna inform me she couldn't make it because she didn't have the budget for it since she spent most if not all on dinner last night. She all but pushed me out the door before I could think up a response. I came back around 3PM and confirmed that the last ferry ride to mainland was at 5PM. I was wrong, we'd just missed it, and Luna stormed off, making separate accommodations. We took the same ferry to mainland, but essentially parted ways.

So... AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-12,"AITA for leaving my best friend while on vacation together? I very well may be an asshole, but how do I redeem myself?

I'd planned this vacation initially for my birthday (23F) back in April and invited my best friend, let's call her Luna (23F), when the original invitees couldn't make it. I had a loose itinerary for the 5 days we'd be at this island for the first time, but booked an island tour for the last day.

Luna booked a flight (she lives in a different city) and I met with her after traveling via land. Shortly after, we realized that the DIY land tour that we wanted to try was too expensive, so from that point on we improvised. Or tried to.

I matched with Nico on the second day, who asked me on a date for the next day, before Luna and I hit the club of the day, and then the after party, and then the after after party. I let Luna know I was leaving with a guy, making it back to our accommodation at around 5AM.

Later when I woke up, I loosely suggested we could meet later tonight for another night of partying as my date was at 2:30PM and Luna helped me get ready for it. I lost track of time and only made it back at around 2AM. I'd completely failed to update Luna on my whereabouts.

This is when I assume it all went to shit. Luna was getting up as I got back and the vibes were already off. No questions, no hype. I asked if she wanted to do anything later, if she had any plans or something. I told her that I could just set an alarm or she could wake me up because I was okay with that, and I also told her that Nico was planning on taking me out again to go up north. Luna didn't really give a solid answer so I went to bed and set my alarm anyway. I wake up to my alarm at around 8AM and find her gone. No message, no note.

So we spent our fourth day on the island mostly apart until dinner. My birthday dinner, which Luna had suggestions and would pay for. I asked her if I should leave Nico, as I was with him since 3PM, and have him pick me up after our dinner, but she said him dropping me off and picking me up seems a bit much and that he could come. We went to the first place she suggested because it was the closest to where we were at, except I didn't know it was a fine dining-esqe situation. When the bill came, Nico had his wallet out but Luna insisted on paying. Turns out we went overbudget (because there was a third person, she tells me later).

Then we partied, Nico bought us drinks, and I left with him. Came home around 6AM.

121,1de3d3v,AITA for kicking a drunk girl out of my apartment?,"Basically I 19M, have a friend Ben, 19M. Ben has a girlfriend, Amy 22F, who has a tendency to be clingy at times and a bit overly controlling. Obviously, this is none of my business, so I stay out of it, despite my personal dislike of her behavior.

So, what happened was that, I, having the biggest apartment out of our friend group had a party, where alcohol may have been present. Ben drank way too much while we were talking, and having never been around alcohol much before, I hadn't noticed. He started talking to me about his relationship issues, though he was being vague, and kept going on about Amy being 'mean' to him, but didn't elaborate further when I asked.

By the time I used my brain, and went hold up there's a limit to how much alcohol you should drink, he was swaying and stuff. He asked to stay with me, cause he didn't want to go home so I half-dragged him up to my room and he fell asleep on my bed. Before that he told me he didn't want to be with 'the meanie', AKA Amy, as he had referred to her several times in our conversation.

Then, I got people to start leaving cause it was late. Amy was also drunk when I saw her and told me she wanted to stay with her boyfriend, as they came together. I told her no, I did not want her in my home, especially overnight. I called her and her friends an uber, and told her to go home with them. She started yelling at me, calling me all kinds of names, which is the point where I kicked her out, and he friends took her to the uber.

Ben isn't up yet, and probably won't be for a while and feeling guilty about the exchange. Was there a better way to handle that? Obviously Ben is my priority, Amy is just my friend's girlfriend, not my actual friend. But maybe I shouldn't have done that?

124,1de2q9t,AITA for dismissing my sister saying I need to rename my son because it's on her baby list and telling my parents she better buy the rights for names if she wants to stop people using them?,"This is so petty but maybe I went too far.

I (26f) have an older sister Jade (28f) who is not in a relationship, is not pregnant and is not planning to have kids anytime soon. While I had my son a few days ago. I'm not close to my family. There's a very big golden child thing with Jade and my parents really should have stopped at their one perfect darling kid (what they call her) because I got the short end of the stick with them always.

So when they found out my son's name is Finnick, Jade came and told me I could not call him Finnick and needed to rename my son because Finnick is on her baby boy name list so she's going to use it one day and not me. I laughed in her face and told her to leave and dismissed her request by saying she had no authority in this.

My parents decided to jump in the next day and they told me I should listen to my sister and choose another name to be a good sister to Jade. They said to think about how Jade would feel and she prides herself on that list. I decided to bring some snark into this and my response was simply that if Jade wants to own the rights to names then she better get rich fast and buy those names because otherwise she cannot stop people from using the ones on her list, not even me. For the record, I know it doesn't work like that.

My parents started to freak out over this and basically told me I was being a bully saying things like that and how dare I dismiss Jade. I threw them out too. And what followed was texts from Jade and my parents saying I had no reason to treat them so rudely. I blocked them. I might be done. But did I go too far?

My brother and I have always been super close, throughout the years he had many girlfriends and I generally made it a point to get along with them. 

I liked the vast majority of them so that task wasn‚Äôt that hard, I had good and close relationships with most of them while they were still dating James, and remain in close contact with 2 even after their breakup (with James permission, of course). One being his high school gf Diane (26F), and the second one being his baby mom Sofie (29F). 

When James started dating Laura 2 years ago I also tried to get close to her but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to befriend her. Laura and I are completely different people and have little to nothing in common, she isn‚Äôt a bad person by any means but just not someone I would want to hang out with or talk to on a day to day basis. 

At the end of the day she made James happy, and was a decent step mom to my nephew Rio (4M), so me liking her as a person wasn‚Äôt really important. I also had little to no interactions with her, since whenever I visited James at their apartment she would claim she was too busy to hang out with us, so I would mostly only see her during family reunions/holidays. 

After they got engaged Laura asked me to be her bridesmaid, I refused since I already had a part in the wedding as the grooms sister, was happy with my current position and didn‚Äôt feel like spending thousands to go on a bachelorette trip where I didn‚Äôt know anyone. 

Last month James ex Diane also got engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. I agreed since Diane has been a close friend of mine for years and I was honored that she wanted me to have such an important role in her wedding. 

When Laura heard about this she called me saying that I was really immature for rejecting her request to be a bridesmaid but agreeing to be Diane‚Äôs maid of honor. I told her that Diane was my childhood friend so it was different, Laura then began to interrogating me and asked if Diane and James were the ones getting married would I also refuse her request and be content with only being the grooms sister in the wedding party. 

I told her that that situation was irrelevant since it‚Äôll never happen, Laura continued to bombard me with questions before I finally told her that as her future SIL my only obligation towards her is to treat her with respect and I‚Äôm already doing that, so I don‚Äôt understand what more can she want from me. 

After hearing that Laura ended the call and blocked my number. Her friends are now harassing me and telling me how awful I am for saying that to Laura. 

I‚Äôm genuinely confused since I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve said anything remotely awful or offensive, but I might be missing something. AITA? 


Update: I decided to call James just like some of you guys suggested. I explained to him the entire situation with Laura and sent him screenshots of the texts her friends kept sending me. He was surprised since Laura never mentioned it and said he'd get back to me.

Instead of calling me back James showed up at my apartment an hour ago. He told me that he talked with Laura about the entire situation and he finally understood what made her act that way. 

Turns out when James‚Äôs friend group held a get together last month, some of his childhood friends were reminiscing and mentioned how they always thought James and Diane would get back together eventually and how odd it was that they are now both engaged to different people. Another friend also mentioned how James and Diane were clearly a better fit and tried to prove his point by pointing out how I liked Diane better than Laura, and since I‚Äôm basically the female version of my brother that must count for something. Apparently while James was completely unaware that this conversation happened Laura overheard the entire thing. 

Instead of telling James what she overheard, Laura fixated on what those friends said and tried to use my approval like some sort of weird competition to prove she was ""better"" than Diane. So when I agreed to be Diane‚Äôs MoH after I refused to be her bridesmaid she kind of spiraled, and tried to use her friends to pressure me and make me feel bad for not joining her bridal party. 

Although James understands what led Laura to act this way, he is mad at her since she went about it in the worst way possible, and this entire situation could‚Äôve been avoided had she communicated with him like an adult. 

He told Laura that he needs some time alone to process what went on, so he‚Äôll be sleeping in my apartment tonight and meeting her tomorrow morning.

Although James understands what led Laura to act this way, he is mad at her since she went about it in the worst way possible, and this entire situation could‚Äôve been avoided had she communicated with him like an adult. 

He told Laura that he needs some time alone to process what went on, so he‚Äôll be sleeping in my apartment tonight and meeting her tomorrow morning. 

Btw, I ended up showing him this post and he said that I as far as he‚Äôs concerned I‚Äôm in the clear, but he did call me an idiot for not calling him earlier and instead sharing what went on with strangers on the internet. ",0.0,0.029886335134506226,0,1
127,1de2693,AITA for snapping at my son‚Äôs grandad? ,"AITAH for snapping at my sons grandad? 

So I (30m) and my partner (27f) have a beautiful 20 month old son, and another on the way. 

I have an issue with the behaviour of her father and sister.

 I am the main provider to our family and have worked damn hard to earn a decent salary to support us. 

We do a great job of raising our son, he‚Äôs very happy and has the most wonderful personality. 

Due to my partners father living very close by, he comes over most days to watch our son while I work in my office. 

I have found out that, behind my back, he and my partners sister (who lives 80 miles away) have discussed in their own group chat, organised and paid for a toddler group 2 days a week at a place round the corner from our house. 

The issue with this is that I am immunocompromised due to treatment for a chronic condition, so I become extremely unwell when picking up the common cold etc. I have explained numerous times that, at the moment, I do not want him in classes every single day as it is not necessary and he is doing just fine developmentally. (He still goes to other toddler classes every week a couple of days).

I have respectfully explained this situation many times to him. So yesterday, when he told me that they had enrolled and paid for 3 months of additional toddlers classes elsewhere, I snapped. 

I said ‚ÄòHow many times do I have to say this? I am his father. Do you have an issue being able to respect the decisions I make for my son or do you just not respect me?‚Äô 

He looked a bit taken a back. I immediately felt horrible. He‚Äôs extremely sensitive and I know he took it extremely personally. I know they‚Äôre trying to help, but it feels like there‚Äôs a committee making decisions about my son that I‚Äôm not part of. 

Again, I know they‚Äôre only trying to help, but this isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve made decisions about what they think is best. I‚Äôve told my partner that our son is our son, and we as his parents make the decisions. 

I have tried politely setting boundaries numerous times, it‚Äôs not working. I just want them to understand the decisions I make are for my son and the benefit of our family. 

I‚Äôm tired of being the bad guy. 

NB: I have also had issues in the past with her father, parading my son round in public and telling strangers it‚Äôs his son. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-12,"AITA for snapping at my son‚Äôs grandad?  AITAH for snapping at my sons grandad?

128,1de213h,AITA for telling my younger siblings I'm not their dad and they need to stop acting like I'm their parent?,"My parents had me (22m) at 19 and I was an only child for 6 years. Then they had three kids back to back who are now 16, 15 and 14. My parents were never the most attentive parents but did a better job with my younger siblings than they did with me. But at some point while my siblings were still really young they started to come to me like I was an adult instead of mom or dad and mom and dad let it happen. They were still there but my siblings would ask me to make them food or they'd ask me for money (I had none back then) or they'd want me to help with homework or they'd come to me if they struggled to do their chores. It got annoying very quickly and I asked my parents to do step in so I wasn't always saying no or having a sibling throw a tantrum because I wasn't acting more like an adult in the house who was there to do stuff for them.

My parents were there for the basics and if my siblings didn't come to me, they'd deal with stuff, but otherwise they seemed glad to not have to deal with all the parenting. They still weren't as good with me as my siblings either. It was things like prioritizing supporting my siblings instead of me, or making a big effort for their birthdays but not mine. Christmas was another time it was super obvious because my siblings got gifts they wanted and I got needed stuff like hygiene products and socks and underwear. I brought it up to my parents when I was 15 and they used the excuse that they had me at 19 so they just didn't know how to connect with me the same and didn't have the means to provide for me like they did my siblings.

When I learned how to drive and started working my siblings relying on me got worse. They wanted me to drive them places, give them money, they wanted me to take them to school and pick them up, they would expect me to buy birthday gifts for their friends and take them shopping for that stuff. My youngest sibling even asked me to be a parent chaperone on field trip when I was only 16. It was suffocating and my siblings could not be spoken to about it. They just wanted me to be the dad. They even called me dad sometimes. I was desperate to get out and Covid almost fucked it up but I was lucky my girlfriends family let me move in with them. Once I left I tried to better enforce my boundaries and created distance but they still wanted me there and they'd cry down the phone about me leaving and not being there for stuff.

Now that my siblings are teens I tried to talk to them about it again but my sister (16) said I had to do these things because I'm supposed to. I asked her why I was supposed to and she said because you're basically our dad. My brothers agreed. I admit it pissed me off and I told them in a firm and angry tone that I am not their dad and they need to stop acting like I'm their parent because I'm their sibling, the oldest sure, but I'm not their parent and I'm not responsible for them.

130,1de1yji,AITA for declining a stranger to sit at my table in a restaurant?,"Hey,

so stupid story, but I've wanted your input on this. I'm not native, so sorry for any mistakes on my part writing this.

I go out quite regularly, usually once or twice a week. Always to the same two restaurants, and - If not with my parents or friends on a special occasion - I'm alone.

Now, two weeks ago I visited that one restaurant, the waiter directed me to a table of four. He knows my name and my usual order, and after a few minutes brings me the starters. The restaurant got full to the brim shortly after i entered; all tables were occupied.

It was then, as I was eating my starters, that an older woman (around 80s, I'd say) came to my table, put down her bag on the chair opposite me (without saying anything), and turned around to the waiter. She was a regular as well, started talking to him. The waiter could see the confusion on my face. As she was facing him - and thus didn't see my face, i was in her back - the waiter could see both her and me, and i shook my head once to signal him that I did not want some stranger sitting with me. He saw that and told the woman that all tables are filled up right now, but in around 5-10 mins there should be an free table for her.

The woman then chuckled, saying that ""Its all fine"" and ""I can sit here"". He pointed out that she can't just sit down at some occupied table, which she dismissed, turning around to me and asking me with a smile if I had a problem with her sitting with to me. I just looked her in the eyes with a neutral expression and flat out (but not so that others could hear me) said ""Yes."" She didn't like that answer, got a bit angry (she didn't make a scene though) and grabbed her bag to wait in the restaurants door.

Well, as the waiter ""predicted"", after around 5 mins there was a free table and she got to sit down and order. Now while most of my friends (and also my parents) say that I didn't do anything wrong, and that it was weird she was actually just gonna sit down there, some of my friends said i am TAH cause I was sitting alone anyways, so why would it matter to me, it was just mean denying her a place.

Yes, I sat at a table of four, but it was the waiter that gave me the table. There is one table of two in the restaurant, but it was occupied as well. And even if she was a regular (i have seen her face before),  i just don't know her, it feels weird for me to eat or read a book while some stranger sits opposite me and watches me doing it. Also, while I don't know her personally, I do know she is quite a chatty one and most like would've talked to me without end. I go out (alone) to have some peace and quiet and enjoy some good meal...

But still - does declining that woman a place at my table make me an AH?

Edit: Something I wanna add cause it was brought up frequently: I'm from Germany. I've done this ""once or twice going out a week"" thing for like 5 or 6 years now, and something like this has never happened before. First time for me; Never happened to my parents or friends either.

For the past 2 years my parents have wanted my brother to get a job. Any job, part-time or casual, minimum wage it doesn‚Äôt matter and somehow the blame is put on me as I‚Äôve refused to help him. Apart from being incredibly lazy, my brother has no ailments holding him back. He is an able-bodied adult. He has a car, lives at home and has no bills. He gets an allowance from both my parents and they pay for everything from phone bill, to car insurance to groceries. 

My sister (31F) and I never had any help in this regard. When our parents cut us off financially at 18 and told us to get jobs, we did. To us it‚Äôs just a fact of life: once you become an adult, you need to get a job to sustain yourself. My parents supported him through culinary school and whatever pathways he wants to try. In my opinion, he is manipulating his incompetence. Simple things like washing the dishes‚Äîmy mom will do them because he doesn‚Äôt do it correctly.

She‚Äôll also avoid a part of the house because that‚Äôs where his room and bathroom are, and she knows if she sees that, she‚Äôll get upset.

Today, she took my brother to the local RSL where she knows an employee to try and get him a job. That person was unavailable, but she met someone else who speaks the same language as us, and they gave her a contact number of someone who can get him a job out of state. My mom asked me to send a message to them on her behalf, and when I said no, a fight erupted. Basically, I argued that I would not help with anything to do with him. She called me cruel and selfish and said it wasn‚Äôt helping him but helping her because she can‚Äôt afford to support him. She brought up that I won‚Äôt help him edit his resume, send messages for him, or find him a job. My rebuttal is that he‚Äôs 21; he can use ChatGPT to edit his resume and seek has a quick apply function for job applications. As it got more heated, I told her that under no circumstances will I help him, he could become homeless and I still wouldn‚Äôt do anything for him.

My friend of six years we‚Äôll call soap keeps reposting videos clearly about me saying I abandoned her for braking up with her. Me and her where inseparable and she was never bad to me until I started hanging out with other friends (Just to be clear I wasn‚Äôt leaving her out she joined us even tho the other people didn‚Äôt like her) I stared to notice signs in text, she was crying about one of the girls I hung out with (I ‚Äôll call butter) even though she never did anything. I tryed to calm her down through the phone until she said the rudest thing, she said ‚Äútbh she‚Äôs kinda fat‚Äù I was shocked and she deleted it immediately. About 7 mouths later than we had a sleepover, nothing was out of the ordinary until I was trying to sleep when I heard butters voice in a phone she was talking normally, I felt like I‚Äôd recognised the message like I‚Äôd heard it before. A few seconds later I heard MY voice I realised she was snooping on my phone while I was asleep. I messaged her during a text fight that she has 30 second to say what ever until I blocked her. I do feel guilty because she transferred schools ""because of me"" (she actually transfered because she was lonely) 

She did other things like 

-Gave away my private TikTok ACC
-Didnt respect others space 
-Would open the door and laugh when you where in the bathroom 
-was friends with my bully 
-told me not to be friends with a girl because she was really rude, turns out she just didn't wan me to be friends with her
-would steal my stuff 
-would constantly go on about things like ""you invited her not me that's so unfair""
-she was transphobic and said that it's weird and unnatural 
And would gossip about other people 

So AITA????

147,1ddzmhv,AITA fir not changing my plans for a friends son to enjoy a binge fest?,"
I've had a friend for over a decade. In the past few years we've kind of parted ways, as I've started being more of a SAHM and our circles don't really mix too much anymore, as she has a life and works a lot. 
She has two children 12M, and 6F. I love these kids. I was babysitting  them, picking them up,  taking them to school,  taking mine to school,  picking them and mine up at 3 separate times and locations,  and then feeding them while 8-9 months pregnant  until I had my last child and then I sort of stopped hearing from her once I had my most recent son, I believe because I was no longer available as a sitter once I delivered. I've been working on putting up more boundaries if she asks for favors.  It might be in my post history.
 I also have a son, 8M, who always adores her son, and they loved to play together, so when I didn't hear from her,  it kind of sucked because our children are friends. Our last major interaction was my sons first birthday,  which I invited her to about a month early. She said she would come.  At the same time she invited me to a last minute Easter party thing at her house and I told her I probably wouldn't be able to make it because my partners family wanted us over.  I never heard from her again about my sons party. I texted her and called her to see if she was going to show and got no response. 
For some reason, she's become a very tit for tat person.

She reached out to me last week and we've been chatting again.  Well she asked me if I could pick up her son from something across town this week. Normally I would be free,  I have no life and I'm a SAHM but that day happens to coincide with a certain TV shows release date,  and another friend and myself had already made plans for her to come over and us to binge this series together. While I have free time,  the friend I'm hanging out with works a full time job,  and is on summer break from being a full time student so our time together is limited.  What she wants is at 1230, I'd get done by 1, and my friend and I were supposed to get started at 12.
Now I've told her that I can't get her child. And she's mad because I won't take the time from whatever I'm doing with this other friend,  claiming I always make excuses for when she asks me for favors and that's why we're not friends, even though my family and other friends of mine/ours have told me to set boundaries with her,  which is what I'm attempting to do. I already had plans, even though they are adjustable.  I have no clue what her other plan was to get her child.  
Now I've told her I'll ask my friend if we can postpone,  but I only got asked this favor yesterday.  I feel like getting mad I last minute am choosing not to help  is extremely poor sighted of her,  as it's taking time from what I had already been looking forward to do,  despite it not being a priority.

I had been in a very bad mental space that was pretty concerning. I had gotten help and was taken to a behavorial institute for a week. After coming home my mom was given a very big warning to take it slow with me as she was the reason for most of my trauma's, triggers, and health problems. She was given a list of my triggers and my mdd medicine and insomnia medicine. 2 days later she started making me do all the chores: cleaning dishes, cleaning every room, vaccuming, sweeping, ETC. She exhausted me before school even had a chance. I started not getting up for school and didn't go for a week and a half due to being tremendously tired and not having any motivation to even move. Some days I physically couldn't. To make a very long story short. She started saying I was faking everything because none of it was a problem before hand but that was because I always hid away and never talked. This other day she started yelling at me for not doing the dishes. Btw. She was supposed to take me to one on one therapy every Saturday at noon and I've been taken 3 out of 11 times.

151,1ddzaqa,"AITA for spending ""our"" money on ""dumb stuff""","Hello,

Tldr: I've spent about 350‚Ç¨ on skins in cs within a timespan of 6 months. My girlfriend insists that I should be saving my money but I feel like we're comforable enough to afford having some fun.

I (20m) have been dating my girlfriend (20f) for two and a half years now. 

We've had our ups and downs, but we're overall happy. However, there's a thing has risen up that my girlfriend thinks is a problem, which I oppose. 

To preface, I have been working since I was 17. I have saved up some money during the years (~30k) and still live at my parents house. I currently work at my dad's garage and make pretty shit money, about 2000‚Ç¨/month while working for about 55-60 hours a week. 

My girlfriend has been working on and off for two years now, and has about 22k saved up on her bank account. She's currently studying for her nursing degree, which will take about 1,5 years to finish. She makes somewhere from 700-1400‚Ç¨/month.

We are planning on moving out and buying a car by autumn, which I have been putting off because of money. I now feel we're secure enough to move out and live comfortably.

Here's the issue: I used to play a certain game that mainly focuses on slots but has some first person shooter elements in it: Counter Strike. 

I recently picked it back up and have been having a blast. I got back into skins, and started buying a couple at a time. 10-20 bucks here and there. Then eventually I got the big two, gloves and a knife. Right now my inventory comes up to around 350‚Ç¨.

I feel like I should say this: I don't open cases or use sites like empire (gamble). I always buy what I want.

I hadn't told my girlfriend about this spending (because I didn't feel like I was obligated to and have already apologised) and she heard about this during a party at my friend's house, when my friend asked if I had gotten any new stuff and flexed his new shit.

My girlfriend thinks that I'm throwing away our money when I should be saving up to move out. I have been on the skin train for months now, and it had taken me around half a year to come up to this number. Plus in my defence cs skins are sellable for real money.

I do understand that cs skins are, well, a stupid purchace, but I do think I should be able to spend a bit of money on fun stuff just because. I feel like it's not fair that she gets to get lip fillers and her lashes done etc but I can't get skins when they're kinda the same thing in a sense. Plus my inventory costs just 50‚Ç¨ more than a single lip filling appointment!

Feel free to ask questions if needed.

153,1ddz4ti,AITAH for telling my BF that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it‚Äù in regards to his ex best friend telling him she‚Äôs going to stop drinking?,"I (24M) recently got in to an ‚Äúargument‚Äù with my BF (20M) over his ex best friend. For context he had this friend (20F) who he was close with on and off throughout highschool. I personally have never liked her just as a person but tolerated her out of respect for him since we‚Äôve been together. This past August him and I moved in to our first apartment together, and his best friend (at the time) also moved in to help reduce costs. I was hesitant but just went with it at the time because I assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be that bad. However over the course of the last year she has been an absolute nightmare of a person and a roommate. She stopped her plans of going to college and refuses to get her license. She works part time as a hostess and calls off all the time and never works, which has caused her to be late on our rent a couple times. She also has developed a pretty severe drinking problem and goes out nearly every night and gets absolutely fucked up. This has lead to her being drunk and riding home with her friends who were also drunk and crashed in to my parked truck and nearly totaling it, and she proceeded to lie about the situation. She brings random people to our place all the time, several of them being actual felons. Mind you I have payed for and furnished everything in our apartment except her room. She also is just a terrible roommate, never cleans, never helps with paying for things like toilet paper or paper towels, and her room smells so bad that if she leaves the door even cracked the whole place smells.

Now several months ago my BF and his friend started a fight because she takes advantage of him and uses him for money and rides and manipulates him into always feeling bad for her and always taking her places and hanging out with her because of her ‚Äúmental state‚Äù or her ‚Äúfamily problems‚Äù. After this they distanced themselves from each other and she‚Äôs just gotten worse.

There is a lot more that I‚Äôd love to share but I don‚Äôt have the space to type it. 

Well over the last couple weeks they‚Äôve been talking more and hanging out some. I‚Äôm not happy about it but it‚Äôs his choice and not my place to say otherwise. In these past weeks she still constantly disappoints him and shows she doesn‚Äôt care but I think he just doesn‚Äôt see it.

Well today, I overheard her tell him that she was calling off of work(again) and I asked him what that was about. He told me that she found out last night that her mom is going to rehab and she‚Äôs just down about it. (Her mother has ongoing problems with substance abuse and poor relationships) I said ok that‚Äôs fair. He then told me that she confused in him that she is going to stop drinking because she realized that she‚Äôs just turning in to her mother.

Now for context over the last year she has informed him and I many many times that she is going to stop drinking because she has a problem or that she is turning in to her mother.

So in response to this I just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure what nerve I struck but he told me that I was being rude. He then proceeded to tell me that ‚Äúat least her mom is getting help, unlike your dad who just decided he was going to overdose and kill himself‚Äù (which is true and something I confided with him out of trust. When I tried to ask what that was about he told me that she was ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù this time and that it‚Äôs different and that her drinking problem in relation to her mothers is much better than ‚Äúyou doing drugs when your dad died from them‚Äù.

2 months later, she was struggling to get them to come and mentioned that places are expensive too. And that she was struggling with a lot of parts of her plan. 

Last time 2 of them stayed (3 including her) and they left the patio door open all the time before leaving and moved seating outside and just left a bunch of red solo cups and liquor on the counter before they‚Äôd go do whatever.

155,1ddyijm,AITA for wanting my share of the house sale.,"So part of our inheritance from my grandparents was a house for my dad, my adult brother and I to share anywhere we wanted to live. 

We had been sharing a apartment after I came back from college so we chose central FL.
So in the spring of 2019 my grandfather gave us the money to purchase one.
Unfortunately from being out of state and being on a time crunch of needing to be out of our apartment lease we got suckered into buying a dud.

We ended up spending way too much time and money over the past 4 years trying to fix and maintain the house. Quite a bit of it kept falling on me and it was draining me so this time last year I moved out of the house, into a apartment with my boyfriend. 

My dad and brother both have expressed that they felt like I abandoned them with this house but I feel like I am finally getting to live my life. I'm in my late 30s so I couldn't be expected to live  with there forever. 

Well I didn't know how abandoned and overwhelmed they were because apparently the last few weeks they have been working with a realtor company who would take over fixing the house up and putting it up on the market. Without my knowledge. 

Until today Dad randomly texted me that he was selling the house. I didn't think much about it, maybe he had been arguing again with my brother and he was just annoyed. 
Then a hour later I get a call that they had notary on the line and they wanted me to sign on putting the house on the market, them planning on splitting the profit without me.

I was blown away! First off my name is on the deed so they couldn‚Äôt legally not split it without me. Secondly, that house was clearly to be part of all 3 of our inheritances and even though I didn't live there anymore I definitely put my dues in on that house.

Sure they might have put quite a bit in the past year and could use the money, that doesn't mean I don't deserve it too. 
I ended up getting the contact info the realtor company and was able to make it clear that if we were to put the house on the market I would expect my share and a notary is coming tomorrow to make it official. 
I know my dad and brother are probably pissed about this since they will get less splitting it 3 ways but I am just as hurt that they think I don't deserve it.

I feel like I‚Äôd be the asshole because there is no good reason to not carpool, I‚Äôd be negatively impacted their finances and adding to more traffic as emissions all because I find them annoying. ",0.0,0.08439846336841583,0,1

On this night, i started to draw a man, at the early stages I decided to switch it to a woman, and continued on, I don't claim to be an amazing artist, but I really don't like when people just point out the errors in my art, expecially when all my friend said was ""she looks like a dude"". Because she'd said it so many times and the feeling had been festering I raised my voice and said ""Fuck off about the guy thing!"" It was kind of out of no where and she was like ""Jeez!

What starts as a favor, quickly becomes an obligation. This happened to me when I was in college (in my country we live at home until we get married). I was in the same group with a ""friend"" from high school, my dad would pick me up at 9:30 pm. She didn't have transportation, so my dad would drive like 12 extra blocks in the opposite direction to make sure she got home safely and never charged her a dime. This lasted about 5 months. At the end of the semester, our Calculus teacher gave everyone the chance to take a test to improve bad scores, but I didn't needed, I had a very good grade, therefore I didn't have to assist that day. She knew about it, she asked me about the test and I told her I didn't need to take it. The next day, I arrived and everyone was mad at me because apparently,I ABANDONED her, she was alone at night and her mom had to take a taxi to pick her up. I didn't understand, was I supposed to go to class that day JUST TO TAKE HER HOME??? Funny thing is, after that day she never spoke to me again or even thanked my dad.

The salon she goes to is in an area within a fairly large shopping center. There's a lot of cosmetic services related shops in this corner and the clientelle is very young as it is in a high school and university area.

When she was done she didn't ask me to drive their either and it was raining much more heavily by then and while she didn't say anything about the rain she got upset at me and doesn't seem to understand my issue with parking near those shops.

My mom ended up telling me to go to my room to calm down, but now I‚Äôm sitting here, pissed while they joke around. It feels like I‚Äôm a common enemy now, that I‚Äôm the problem. And maybe I am, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking Reddit, AITA?

167,1ddwgqo,AITA for not paying back my friend for a service I did not receive ? ,"My friend (18F) and I (17M) went on a vacation to Toronto together. Since I didn‚Äôt have a credit card, she was supposed to make the reservation. I kept asking her to look for hotels and activities a few weeks prior, but she wouldn‚Äôt until the day before we left (we stayed a day in Montreal). She wouldn‚Äôt tell me which hotel she picked and when I showed her hotels, she would automatically say no. The evening before we left for Montreal, she told me to find a place, because she was staying at a friend‚Äôs appartement. I ended up at my aunt‚Äôs. The next day, we arrived at Toronto near 11pm. She had already paid a $90 deposit on the room. We went to the front desk and they asked for our Ids. I gave the guy mine, and said I was too young. Immediately, my friend asked if she was allowed in since she was a year older. The answer was no. She spent 30 minutes looking at hotels on her phone, refusing to tell me the name of where she was looking at so I could call them, and denying all of my suggestions. I have crooked knees, so I cannot stand up for too long. Tired and in pain from waiting half an hour, I called the first hotel I saw on google and immediately got a room. I ended up paying the full price at once. We were supposed to stay there two weeks, but she told me the morning off that she was only staying three days. She ended up accepting to stay five days, and I stayed a little bit longer at another hotel by myself in Montreal. Walking towards the subway station, I told her we were not going to the same station (I was going to an hotel and she was going to the bus station). She just said ‚Äúbye‚Äù and walked off. 

A few hours later, she sends a voicemail asking for my part of the deposit. I politely declined, telling her I wouldn‚Äôt pay for a service I didn‚Äôt receive and that it was her fault for not reading the website and confirmation email, both of which states the age restriction. She called me poor, said that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to go to Toronto without her because she paid for the train tickets from Montreal to Toronto with her credit card (I paid her pack on the same day), and that I would‚Äôve made the same mistake as her. I sent her a screenshot off the hotel‚Äôs website which stated on the first line of the rules that it was 19+. She deleted me from every group chats we had together and told me that if I wanted to do something with our friends or talk to them, it would be without her (that was after two shorts messages from me).

She is still calling me poor, refusing to pay me back for what I paid for her (more than the $45 I ‚Äúowed‚Äù her), and won‚Äôt have a normal adult conversation about it. I was about to pay her like 20$ before she went on her tangent, but I didn‚Äôt offer it after everything went down.

168,1ddvz9t,AITA for not supporting my friends Business?,"I 27 and my Best friend 26M who we')) call Jack. Opened his own business recently. I supported him in the beginning due us being friends for a long time. The business he opened was my original business idea I had a while ago. N9thing fancy. But would've had a large starting customer base due to the amount of people who lived in our city and both of us either being related to alot of them of family friends with alot of them. I was not allowed to open my business or start it at the time as my family said no to me doing such a thing in our drive way. My friend however has just opened his 3 weeks ago. I supported him early on, giving him pricing ideas, showing him how to do certain services. All around trying to be polite and happy for him. It was the other day I called him and asked him for his services and asked how much, knowing full well the price would be $150. To my surprise he told me that the cost would be almost double at $295. We had been friends for a long time and I wanted to show my support though he originally took my idea and ran with it. I told him that is well out of my budget and asked why he doubled his price in only 3 weeks of the original pricing. ""There's a poor tax for you. You want the services, you needa pay for it. There is no reason for you to be poor in 2024. Pay it or do it yourself!"" And added some profanities in there. I am in no way rich or even doing ok financially. I'm in alot of debt I'm struggling to pay off and have lost my own family due to my sexuality and had to start from scratch in a new city, new and low paying job and struggle to get by. Even haven't bought clothes in 2 years and shoes in 3 years. I have been as polite as I could and this morning he called me and said ""I'll do the service for $250, just cause you're a friend, how about that?"" I told him ""No, it's still out of my budget and I can do it better than you myself"". He hung up and proceeded to send me messages boasting about how much he's making out of this business and calling me poor.
