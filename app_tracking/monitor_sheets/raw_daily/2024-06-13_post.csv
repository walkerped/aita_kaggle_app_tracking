0,1denzn2,AITA for not including my groupmate's name for an assignment?,"For context, we have 4 assignments assigned to be done in groups of 2 or by yourself. I was asked by, let's call her A and I said yes. For the first assignment we worked on it together and decided to do the rest the same way, since it's so much easier to communicate in person. We would meet before class to work on them together. We did the same for the 2nd assignment with no problem. 

Now for the 3rd one, A didn't show up. I message A but she didn't reply until a few days later (said she was sick) and I have been working on the assignment and finished almost all of it. A then messaged me the night before it was due asking if it was finished and I told her that there was only one bit I didn't finish (I left the easiest part last). She did that and sent it to me and I handed them with both our names on it.

She still did not show up to classes until today (last day of class), after two weeks. I finished the last assignment on my own and handed it in with only my name on it. I told her about it after class through text and she asked if there was any reason that I didn't include her name. I thought it was obvious since I worked on it alone. I do feel bad since she was sick but I'm tired of people not showing up with no prior notice. 

So, AITA?

2,1denk4w,AITA My boyfriend got mad at me and hasn’t talked to me,"We started off our day going to get our eyebrows done at this place I regularly go. We were both on board until we got back to the car and realized he didn’t like them. I told him they looked good seeing them at a distance however, he’s kinda upset over the situation saying he’s never going to let them do his eyebrows. I asked him why he didn’t tell them to fix them up and his response was because you said they looked good. In this situation I felt bad and wished he said something. I just made it my whole issue because he wasn’t happy. Im overly sensitive so I was trying to prevent myself from crying cuz I just felt bad even though I felt like it wasn’t a big issue knowing that he could fix and trim them when he gets home. We get to a gas station cuz he needs to get gas and I usually fill it up for him but this time I don’t go cuz I’m a little upset that he’s s upset at me. I start feeling like an asshole cuz he’s tired and we’re just both upset but he gets out and slams the car door and doesn’t talk to me the whole way to his house. During this time Im just trying to keep myself from crying cuz he’s never slammed a door in front of me nor gotten so heated up. In the car I asked him “why he’s so upset” and got no response.

3,1demot0,AITA for uninviting my friend on my trip to see my family?,"I (26F) have a friend, 30F, Jessica. Jessica was invited by me to my trip to see my family in Jersey in september. 
Well, the other day trip plans came up, and i made a joke that im going to be at the beach everyday. Jessica got upset and said “if im not going to be accommodated then maybe i should go on my own.” 
she was making plans to go to boston (for a *day*). NYC for 3 days, and philly last day before we leave.  1 day was allotted for jersey. 

this trip is meant to be a trip to see my family, specifically my 85 y/o grandmother. i invited her so she could see my hometown and have fun at the shore, and mentioned we’ll probably go to new york one day. 

i felt as though she was co-opting my trip. 
fast forward that night, we’re in my hot tub, and she won’t get out. i left her in there and then about an hour later told her she needs to get out (she was in here by herself, sleeping on a pool float). she gave me an attitude as to why i was pushing her out of the hot tub. i said “well, if you drown in here it could be a big problem for me” (she was asleep & drunk) 

she said “ok i got it, go inside” so i walked inside and then she came in, all upset for whatever reason? 

i had been stewing on these plans she was making all day. i blurted out “i think we have different expectations for the trip, im going to see my grandmother, not to go to new york everyday” 
she followed up with, “if you don’t want me to go then i won’t” 

and i said “yes” and she got upset, and stormed out of the house and drove home drunk (no one told her to leave). 

my partner (30F) told me it was uncalled for, as i was the one who invited her on the trip, and we previously discussed letting things play out and see if jessica uninvited herself to the trip. 

my partner told me i acted unhinged, and it was not the time to say that since she was already upset and the tone i said it in made her feel attacked.

4,1demmr8,AITA [M21] for not telling my girlfriend [F22] my weekend plans earlier?,"
I’m planning to go see my family for the weekend. I made this decision today, about an hour ago after talking with my mom on the phone. Later she calls me after work. I asked about her day and let her know what my plans were for the weekend

She was unhappy that I didn’t tell her earlier in the week even though I only made decision today. She says “in the future even if you’re thinking about other plans I want to know.” This is strange to me because we don’t see each other every weekend. I let her know a while ago that since I moved for work and I’m no longer as close we would be seeing each other every other weekend. Plus she was over my place just this past weekend

She said “I don’t like change so I like to be made aware so I know how to plan my weekend.” This part especially left me scratching my head because if no plans were made then nothing changed and whatever plans she had for her weekend won’t be affected by mine being that they won’t intersect. Lastly we talk every day and whenever things come up I tell her so it’s even like this is a pattern

This honestly feels clingy and controlling but what do you think? I don’t think I did anything wrong here and I’m not even sure how to improve. My weekends are mine; if we want to spend time then we let each other know. Otherwise we have our own lives

5,1demmno,AITAH for telling my uncle his wife is a thief?,"I (24f) told my uncle (30m) that his wife (31f) is a thief.
There are several people involved in all of this.
Steve: Uncle.
Missy: Uncle's wife.
Eddy: Uncle's dad.
Addy: Cousin.

This are the circumstances:
- Around 2 years, $5k were stolen from Eddy's home. No one knew who it was, but they suspected it was Missy. 
- Around the same time, Steve's roomate told him that Missy had stolen close to $1.5k from him. Steve did not believed him and ended up loosing his roommate. 
- Around 6 months ago we notices that my mom ""lost"" some jewlery that was very hidden in her room. Amounting close to $5k. The only ones that had access to my mom's room were them.
- Close to a month ago Eddy's wife ""lost"" some jewelry that was less than $1k
- Two weeks ago, Eddy left his phone on the table and it disappeared from the table.

Addy called my mom and told her Eddy had his phone stolen and, again, the only variant was Missy. She was the only person who was an ""outsider"" in all of this circumstances. All of them happend when she was around. No one had told Steve anything since we had no proof. No one had proof of anything. The family was starting to notice that, in fact, she was the only variant. Always.

So, I asked Steve to call me when  he was alone. It took him close to a week to do so, and when he did, i told him everything. I also called Addy and told her to expect a call from Steve since he wanted more information on this.

Today i woke up to my mom yelling at me for getting into ""her"" business and ratting out Missy to Steve. Saying that it was not my place and i had no right to tell anything to Steve. Maybe it wasn't my place to say anything? 

Why did i do it? The thing is... Steve is in his last year as a resident. And his roomate was a resident as well.

Examples:  In 2019 my car died.  I asked for a 2016-2018 to replace it.

Still, I appreciated the thought.  FF to now.  He gets himself a 2024, fully tricked out with all the best features.  It irks me a bit that he got me a basic and himself a premium.

If this was the only time, I’d maybe feel a little hurt then let it go.  But it happens a lot.  He gets himself the latest phone every 2-3 years, but mine literally has to die, sometimes after 5-7 years of use, and I always get one a few years old.  He has no problem buying expensive tools for his garage that he uses maybe 1-2 times a year (if that), but if I want to drop a bit of money on a new set of quality cooking equipment (the kind that comes with a lifetime guarantee) it’s too expensive, and I cook at least one meal every single day, usually two meals.

I grew up with a mother who abused me, including constant gaslighting.  It has made me constantly question my own thoughts and perceptions.  Recently, I’ve finally sought therapy, which is helping, and is making me raise these questions.  I’m wondering if I married a malicious narcissist like my mother was…
