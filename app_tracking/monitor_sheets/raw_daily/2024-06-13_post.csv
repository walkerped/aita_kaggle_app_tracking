0,1denzn2,AITA for not including my groupmate's name for an assignment?,"For context, we have 4 assignments assigned to be done in groups of 2 or by yourself. I was asked by, let's call her A and I said yes. For the first assignment we worked on it together and decided to do the rest the same way, since it's so much easier to communicate in person. We would meet before class to work on them together. We did the same for the 2nd assignment with no problem. 

Now for the 3rd one, A didn't show up. I message A but she didn't reply until a few days later (said she was sick) and I have been working on the assignment and finished almost all of it. A then messaged me the night before it was due asking if it was finished and I told her that there was only one bit I didn't finish (I left the easiest part last). She did that and sent it to me and I handed them with both our names on it.

She still did not show up to classes until today (last day of class), after two weeks. I finished the last assignment on my own and handed it in with only my name on it. I told her about it after class through text and she asked if there was any reason that I didn't include her name. I thought it was obvious since I worked on it alone. I do feel bad since she was sick but I'm tired of people not showing up with no prior notice.

she said “ok i got it, go inside” so i walked inside and then she came in, all upset for whatever reason?

4,1demmr8,AITA [M21] for not telling my girlfriend [F22] my weekend plans earlier?,"
I’m planning to go see my family for the weekend. I made this decision today, about an hour ago after talking with my mom on the phone. Later she calls me after work. I asked about her day and let her know what my plans were for the weekend

She was unhappy that I didn’t tell her earlier in the week even though I only made decision today. She says “in the future even if you’re thinking about other plans I want to know.” This is strange to me because we don’t see each other every weekend. I let her know a while ago that since I moved for work and I’m no longer as close we would be seeing each other every other weekend. Plus she was over my place just this past weekend

She said “I don’t like change so I like to be made aware so I know how to plan my weekend.” This part especially left me scratching my head because if no plans were made then nothing changed and whatever plans she had for her weekend won’t be affected by mine being that they won’t intersect. Lastly we talk every day and whenever things come up I tell her so it’s even like this is a pattern

This honestly feels clingy and controlling but what do you think? I don’t think I did anything wrong here and I’m not even sure how to improve. My weekends are mine; if we want to spend time then we let each other know. Otherwise we have our own lives

5,1demmno,AITAH for telling my uncle his wife is a thief?,"I (24f) told my uncle (30m) that his wife (31f) is a thief.
There are several people involved in all of this.
Steve: Uncle.
Missy: Uncle's wife.
Eddy: Uncle's dad.
Addy: Cousin.

This are the circumstances:
- Around 2 years, $5k were stolen from Eddy's home. No one knew who it was, but they suspected it was Missy. 
- Around the same time, Steve's roomate told him that Missy had stolen close to $1.5k from him. Steve did not believed him and ended up loosing his roommate. 
- Around 6 months ago we notices that my mom ""lost"" some jewlery that was very hidden in her room. Amounting close to $5k. The only ones that had access to my mom's room were them.
- Close to a month ago Eddy's wife ""lost"" some jewelry that was less than $1k
- Two weeks ago, Eddy left his phone on the table and it disappeared from the table.

Addy called my mom and told her Eddy had his phone stolen and, again, the only variant was Missy. She was the only person who was an ""outsider"" in all of this circumstances. All of them happend when she was around. No one had told Steve anything since we had no proof. No one had proof of anything. The family was starting to notice that, in fact, she was the only variant. Always.

So, I asked Steve to call me when  he was alone. It took him close to a week to do so, and when he did, i told him everything. I also called Addy and told her to expect a call from Steve since he wanted more information on this.

Today i woke up to my mom yelling at me for getting into ""her"" business and ratting out Missy to Steve. Saying that it was not my place and i had no right to tell anything to Steve. Maybe it wasn't my place to say anything? 

Why did i do it? The thing is... Steve is in his last year as a resident. And his roomate was a resident as well.

My mom also felt insecure about him retiring and told him about that. He told my mom that he has stocks and that **she can work if she's feeling insecure**.

My dad always think housewife is an easy job, and he's the only one who's being tired and should take a rest. Also he said that he's not going to do any chores after retiring cause my mom is the one who should do that.

I don't know if my feeling toward this is right but if my mom's job is to do chores, isn't his job to get income for our family??

I asked him what will he do after retiring and he said stay at home and do nothing. I told him that sounds like a bad idea and he pissed off, saying no one in the home is on his side. 

My dad has a nice job and income, I know he worked really hard to be on his current status and does not think he should just quit now.

Also, our family don't buy brands, eat in expensive restaurants, or go on expensive trips so spending less money won't be an option.

So, AITA for saying he probably shouldn't retire.

10,1dfcxz0,WIBTA For Not Helping My Mom With Her Dog If I Told Her Not To Get It?,"I (22nb) live with my mother in a decent sized house with two dogs and a cat. The first dog we got is almost 12 years old, and has never been a fan of other dogs. She also has a lot of hip issues, as is common with her breed. Because of this, her activity is limited, and I try to avoid situations where she'd be forced to move a lot (long walks, hopping on furniture, etc.) 
She's been having these issues for a while, so when my mom mentioned the aspect of getting a new puppy, I immediately voiced my opposition. My mother is older and also has a lack of mobility, so I already knew the needs of this puppy would fall to me, and I had ZERO interest. I struggle caring for myself, and did not want another thing on my plate. 
My mom insisted, and I told her then and there I would not be a caretaker for this dog. Of course I wouldn't neglect him, but I would not be taking him to appointments, walks, etc. 
As soon as he arrived, he immediately kept knocking over our other dog, tearing up things, and being, well, a puppy. I was incredibly annoyed and angry because she immediately started asking me of favors regarding him. 
It's been a year since he's arrived and he has not been trained. He still destroys things, chases the cat, and is too rough with the older dog (we can not let them out into the backyard together or he WILL knock her down.)
He currently has a bad rash and is breaking out, and my mom told me to take him to the vet tomorrow. WIBTA if I said no? I had plans and I don't want to wrangle him.

11,1dfcqbu,AITA for not helping my coworker?,"Ok so, we’re both doing Task B at a huge conference. Task B is not as taxing as our boss implies, so I have downtime. On downtime I normally do other things, but I had to give up my work laptop to one of our IT guys. So I was pretty much spacing out. 

My coworker proposes they train me on Task C, which I readily accept. This is an in depth task they’ve been doing for years. I, a new hire, wasn’t even aware it was a thing. Anyway the training starts out well but my coworker eventually begins to speak to me like I am retarded. Very rude and brusque way of speaking, which I wouldn’t even mind if they were being helpful. But they weren’t. They gave me unclear information then proceeded to get angry and mocking when I asked for clarification. How this ends is, after our lunch, they turn to me and ask if I want to give Task C another try: I say no. They blow up at me and demand to know what I’m doing then, and I reply what’s written on my schedule. AITA for doing that? Being talked down to by someone who isn’t my boss for a task I wasn’t assigned is annoying. 

You can stop reading here if you want, what’s below is mostly ranting.

Anyway this coworker calls my boss and complains about my behavior. I don’t know what exactly they said, but they framed it in such a way that it seemed as if I was trying to get out of work. My boss was suspect as well though.  I called my boss to discuss it and apparently this task, which has up to this point been framed as optional (even by my boss who just yesterday jokingly said “she isn’t supposed to be training you!) is now actually totally something I was meant to be doing all along and my boss just forgot to tell me or put it on the schedule I’ve had for two weeks. 
 
I don’t think I’m in trouble as I clarified to my boss I only refused to do the task due to my coworkers rude behavior, but I’m now worried said coworker is gossiping about me behind my back. I do feel my coworkers are annoyed that I’ve had little to do due to scheduling. My coworker has also had little to do, but she’s everyone’s best friend so of course she’s faultless here.

14,1dfc4ic,AITA For not letting my dad stay when he had no where to go?,"Sorry for the long post, I am just mentally drained.

This is a throw away account. When me and a couple of my siblings got old enough, we decided to rent together and split expenses. The only parent we had any contact with is our father. He does not have his life together. The only thing I can remember him helping us with was maybe a light bill once and that was our late teens going into our twenties and having one of our youngest siblings (YS) stay with him.

But some of us ended up sending him money on multiple occasions. To fix cars he buy and would say it’s so he can see us more often, I can count on one hand the amount of times he has come to see us over the years. We always ended up visiting him. To renovate an apartment with a shady landlord with no lease agreement. For food when he really didn’t have any. For the internet. I was young and dumb and allowed him to put the lights and internet in my name for one place that he ended up losing because he got arrested. I ended up having to pay the balance he left behind.

Always saying how he misses us but does not put in any effort to see us. When we do plan something fun and cover his cost, he would either forget or would arrive very late. So, we stopped inviting him. He gets arrested again and it’s disappointing especially when we find out it’s for the same old mess. The shady landlord came to my YS that was staying with my dad and said that he is not allowed on the property anymore/that they found a replacement for him and was hinting at how soon YS is able to collect their things and leave.

We did a mad dash to rent a moving truck to pack up all our YS things & get them out to move in with a friend in less than 48hrs. While we are done packing and hopping in the van we get a call from our dad. He was released and was cracking jokes and downplaying the whole situation.

Once our YS got situated in their new place we tried to get back to our normal life. Still getting calls for money. At one point he calls one of us hinting that he may have to come stay with us. He was told that we were not comfortable with that. Our leasing office has a zero policy with what he was arrested for and that could have us evicted if they found out. I also believe in my heart of hearts that he stole from our YS before. 

AITA? I have moments where I feel like I made the right choice. Anytime we have a crisis, we solve it on our own. We didn’t ask him for help because we knew he was not reliable. Then I have moments when I remember him paying for the lights once or driving our moving van when we first got together (we were young and didn’t have experience driving trucks at the time). But then I remember all the money that was sent and how we clearly helped him out more monetarily than he has done for us.

16,1dfbvui,AITA for not picking up my friend for a group dinner and causing a fight?,"For some context: there are 7 of us in this group (all 23 y/o), we all were coursemates in University. 4 of us, including myself, live and work in the same part of the city. The remaining 3 stay further away from us.

As 4 of us live closer to each other, we’re able to meet up more for dinner, movies or just general hangouts. One of my friends, we’ll call her N, is part of this smaller group. N lives about 5KM away from me. Whenever the group decides to go out, N usually asks me to pick her up and send her home as she doesn’t have a license and she does not want to spend money on Grab (our version of Uber). I don’t mind this, it’s a short drive (25 mins with traffic).

On the Saturday that 7 of us planned to have dinner, I wasn’t feeling too well so I decided to just rest. I went to sleep around 2PM and woke up really late (around 6.30PM), so I just took a quick shower and rushed to leave the house because we planned to meet at 7PM and I hate being late. Most of my friends are there when I arrive. We start catching up and we realise around 8PM that N had not shown up yet. 

As it turns out, N had texted our group chat at 3PM saying she would be ready at 6.30PM. I did not see this text as I hadn’t opened our group chat since I went to sleep at 2PM. Everyone was confused so we call N multiple times but she didn’t pick up. We get a bit worried and check her location on Find My and see that she’s still home. I check my phone and see that she left me about 5 missed calls but my phone was on Do Not Disturb, so I didn’t receive any of them. The group starts getting worried and paranoid thinking something bad happened so we leave dinner and go to her house. When she opened the door, she looked straight at me and said “Fuck off.” and just closed the door. 

We were all super confused and we waited outside her house for about 45 mins, trying to get her to come out and talk to us but she refused. Everyone was pretty much in a shit mood at this point, so we all just called off the night and went home. 

I find out the next day that the text N had sent to the group chat was meant for me. She was informing me when she’d be ready so I could go pick her up. The thing is, she didn’t mention my name nor did she tag me in the message. All she said, word by word, is that she would be ready by 6.30PM.

She basically expected me to understand this and pick her up. She says that I’m an asshole because I should know that she needs to be picked up because I’ve been the one picking her up for months. She won’t talk to me or reply to any of my calls/messages. The group is divided on this. Some think that I’m in the clear here because I didn’t even see the text, but the other half feel that I should’ve at least checked and asked if she needed a ride given that I’ve been the one driving her all this time.

A lot of passive aggressiveness is going on right now in the group between everyone and it genuinely sucks.

I'm going 53 I'm in the left lane, I'm passing people in the right lane, this guy is riding my ass, as we're coming up to a red light I pass a truck just enough for the guy to cut in front of the truck so we're sitting next to each other at the light.

18,1dfbo56,AITA for requesting (F20)my father(M45) to share half of the maintenance/etc fee for his own car? ,"Background to understand my POV:   
My father has always been absent in my life, my mother took his second car with her during divorce back when I was 15. He never really interacted with me until I started working.  
My mother wasn’t the greatest person and I was diagnosed with depression few years back.  
My father are aware but he thinks I’m delusional and is actually perfectly normal.  
  
My father’s income definitely has no issue to support 4 person’s general life expenses like food, utility bills. I do not know if his girlfriend share any of this expense.  
Ever since I started working at 18, I give around 10-15% of my income monthly to my father for general usage. I paid for dinner for all - almost for 8 months then.   
I now rarely eat at home, and I buy every possible thing that I use (think toiletries, food that can be stored in shelf rather than fridge, everything) with my own money.  
I can’t use house’s fridge or shelf or else they will be gone by the second day and no one will listen to my request of NOT TOUCHING them. I can't share items either..  


  
Point:  
This is the sixth continuous month (with being almost every other month ever since I started working) of him asking me to pay for fees like insurance, maintenance or change of parts for his car, and I have what my country call a minimum wage and I could not afford to even have lunch by the end of the month , and I can't give him almost 40% of my income for his car.  
  
I have paid dozen time in full for this car, each time I told him I’m financially struggling. He dismisses and always mention ""you have so many money to spend"" and I just never respond to that.  
I do borrow his car every other week to drive to work, I alternate with his girlfriend who work at the same company as I do.  
I fill up the car if it is running out of gas. He use the car when I don’t. He has another car that he own.  
There’s always something wrong with this car, and I’m not clueless about how car works. Almost every month he will ask me to pay for something. Last month was engine fixing?? Then in April was something about tire, then march was about changing four of them. Before that he did some tweak here and there but he refuse tell me the details about it.  
  
Then we got into an argument this morning.  
  
He told me the yearly tax is due next month and I asked him if we could share the fee and each pay half as I'm really trying to save up for my goals of studying/moving out (he doesn't know that I want to move out).  
He got really mad and told me that I’m ungrateful, said that I never did anything for this family and is selfish, that I use the car *the* most and I should pay for everything, including loan payment/maintenance/tax/insurance for the car. I simply can’t afford it and I told him I could stop using it if he’d like.

19,1dfbfio,AITA For not letting my dad stay when he had no where to go?,"Sorry for the long post, I am just mentally drained. 

This is a throw away account, I know some of my family uses reddit and I don’t want them to put two & two together. My dad has been in and out of jail since I was young. Mom gave up custody while I was young as well. Me and my siblings were raised by our grandmother. 

When me and a couple of my siblings got old enough, we decided to rent together and split expenses. The only parent we had any contact with is our father. The issue is that he does not have his life together. The only thing I can remember him helping us with was maybe a light bill once and that was our late teens going into our twenties and having one of our youngest siblings (YS) stay with him.  

But some of us ended up sending him money on multiple occasions. Money to fix cars he would randomly buy to get around (this happened 2x from what I remember) and would say it’s so he can see us more often, but I can count on one hand the amount of times he has come to see us over the years. We always ended up visiting him. Money to renovate an apartment with a shady landlord (this is important) that he was staying in with no lease agreement. Money for food when he really didn’t have any. Paying for the internet. I was even young and dumb and allowed him to put the lights and internet in my name because he couldn’t do that with his credit for one place that he ended up losing because he got arrested (this is a pattern). I ended up having to pay the balance he left behind. 

Always saying how he misses us but does not put in any effort to see us. When we do go out of our way to plan something fun and cover his cost, he would either forget or would arrive very late. So, we stopped planning things with him. He would use to say how he wanted us to all live together (I'm assuming because he missed out on our childhood) but when I made it clear that was not happening, he stopped. He gets arrested again and it’s very disappointing especially when we find out it’s for the same old mess. The place he was currently staying at (renovated apartment from the shady landlord) came to my YS that was staying with my dad and said that he is not allowed on the property anymore/that they found a replacement for him and was hinting at how soon YS is able to collect their things and leave. 

So, we did a mad dash to rent a moving truck to pack up all our YS things & get them out to move in with a friend in less than 48hrs. (Our leasing office is very strict with letting people stay over for a certain amount of time. Once our lease ends, we will find a bigger place and have them move in). While we are finally done packing and hopping in the van we get a call from our dad. He was released and was cracking jokes and downplaying the whole situation. I didn’t find it funny.

Once our YS got situated in their new place we tried to get back to our normal life. Still getting some occasional calls for money. At one point he calls one of us trying to hint that he may have to come stay with us. He was told that we were not comfortable with that. Our leasing office has a zero policy with what he was arrested for and that could end with us getting possibly evicted if they found out. I also believe in my heart of hearts that he stole from our YS before (it was the time we were planning a vacation, and they were saving and doing overtime to go and a couple hundred in cash ended up missing. We grew up too poor to go on family vacations and when we finally got stable we wanted to go on trips together and we do now. We just save and do payment plans).  

AITA? I have moments where I feel like I made the right choice. Anytime we have a crisis, we solve it on our own. We didn’t ask him for help because we knew he was not reliable. Then I have moments when I remember him paying for the lights once or driving our moving van when we first got together (we were young and didn’t have experience driving trucks at the time). But then I remember all the money that was sent and how we clearly helped him out more monetarily than he has done for us. I'm just tired of feeling like I am responsible for him, but I still have the sadness of him not having his life together.

I am terrible at differentiating what's a red flag or what's not, but when he said he still wants to be friend with his ex, I had a bad gut feeling. 

He cut contact with her two weeks before we started dating (supposedly he emotionally detached long before that) and they only dated on and off for about half a year. 

We have been dating 2 and a half months, taking for a month before that. 

Recently he has started to talk to her. He told me directly the circumstance on how it happened, and told me his intentions, which is great communication. 

I didn't say anything at the time, expect ""ok"" or along the lines of another neutral ""aknowlagement"" comment. 

It has since bothered me, from my POV, why would you want to continue a friendship with someone who you were previously attracted too when your now dating someone else? It makes me feel like I am not enough, and I sort of see it as disrespectful as I cut all contact with my previous situationship (a guy I have lost all feelings for, and one I do not wish to rekindle any sort of friendship with). Should I be concerned that he cares for her so much that he really doesnt want to adhere to my request?

I told him that their friendship makes me uncomfortable, and that I don't mind them talking or being in group settings together but I don't want them hanging out alone.

His ex is unwell, I feel bad asking him to not be friends with her as I don't want to make her illness worse and put her through emotional distress, nor do I want to put the guilt onto him that he can't be there for someone he cares about. 

He knows what it's like to be betrayed, I believe he wouldn't wish that on anyone, let alone me. I'm starting to think my distrust lies more with the ex rather than him.

Shortly after we moved in, three of our family members were evicted, including the person who gave us the property. We immediately offered that one person a place to stay, but they refused and instead asked us to take in their adult child.

Now here's the part where there are issues. I bought a pre-owned switch and new copy of scarlet on the gamestop website for delivery.

Now we have the switch and game at the store to try and return it and we're having issues.

They came up with going to Las Vegas for a week as we’ve never been before and it’s kinda infamous for being fun. Im not a massive partier especially since I meet my bf but I thought it would still be nice to spend quality time with all my girls. So I agreed and was excited until I told my bf about it. 

We ended up getting into an argument because he told me it wasn’t a good idea and he didn’t want me to go. He said that most of my friends are single so they can go off and party but I’m not so I shouldn’t go without him. My bf’s two concerns was my safety and men hitting on me in clubs/partys. I was saying I have my friends with me and with guys hitting on me, I just tell them I have a boyfriend. I did start to get annoyed with him because it started to sound like he didn’t trust me. So I told him that just because he’s previous gf cheated on him that he doesn’t need to project that onto me. I know my bf does have an issue with a few of my friends as he thinks they are a bit “rowdy” but I don’t think it’s fair of him to judge my friends just because they like to party.  

We‘ve just booked our tickets but my bf is still arguing with me and telling me hes not just letting me go to Las Vegas so I can ”act single” He said that he’ll take some time off work next month and we can go on a trip to have fun together but that’s not the same as going with my friends. I do respect my partner’s opinion but I should be able to do what I want. I told my friends about my bf being annoyed about Las Vegas and they all told me he’s being insecure/controlling about it.

Also he wanted that amount of money before hand but I held off until the day comes. I missed out on two of em. So finally he takes me to go test drive one and of course it doesn’t happen. So now as of today I been waiting for 4 months. My dad surprised and said he found me a 2019 and he ordered It. He didn’t mention it, offer to show me pictures so it was a total surprise. I’m not gonna lie I’m already feeling depressed so hearing that made me cry. I felt like I been put on hold and missed opportunities for the wrong car. If I was wasn’t paying then yeah I’d drive it.

I am only a teenager but my mother had my brother at 16 making him in his 30’s. Ever since i was young I have always talked about naming my future daughter Scarlett, I don’t know why but I have always adored the name. Every time the topic of babies, names, and children comes up I always say that my daughter will be called Scarlett, everyone in my family knows this. Last week, my sister law gave birthday to a healthy baby girl, as you can probably guess, they named Scarlett. I was really upset at my brother as he knows that was my top name, I didn’t make a big deal about it I just left the room obviously upset, Scarlett isn’t a family name or anything and my brother has never mentioned liking the name, one time he said he wasn’t a fan. I asked him why he would name his daughter that and he told me to stop over reacting and get over it and that i don’t own the name. I get that It doesn’t belong to me but just because I am a teenager doesn’t mean
that I am not allowed to have plans for my future.

EDIT: when i say walked out I didnt like storm out or anything i just excused myself. A lot of people are saying that its common for cousins to have to same name but not here and in my family. And. Scarlett isnt a common name here ❤️❤️

I (24NB) am currently living with my parents since finding a place to live while also going through college and trying to enter grad school is too much currently. They're more than happy to let me live with them. However, I'm not out to my parents as being nonbinary. When I used to identify as a trans man, I tried to come out to them and was immediately bashed, so I went back into the closet and hid (this happened when I was 15). I'm perfectly fine with staying this way for as long as I need, but there's one issue that's been bothering me for a while now. My dad (60M) named me after his mother (my paternal grandmother), who died well before I was born when he was in his 20's. I won't divulge too much for privacy's sake, but it was very traumatic and he never got over it. He wanted to keep the memory of her alive, and thus her name became mine. My family doesn't even call me by that name and instead calls me by my middle name, which is just immensely confusing honestly. Anyways, I chose a different name for myself when I was 15 and figured out I wasn't cis. Since I didn't want my name to be feminine, I chose a more neutral/masculine name and it's stuck ever since. Only close friends, my girlfriend, and coworkers know that I go by this name, I've kept it hidden from my family for fear of what they might think.

A little while ago, my dad and I were talking when my mom was off at work. We eventually came around to the conversation of gender (I can't remember how at this point) and I decided, rather impulsively, to test my luck and see how my dad would respond to me telling him about my identity. When I got to telling him about my name, he got very defensive. He told me I was being disrespectful to her legacy by changing my name, that I could identify however I wanted but I couldn't change my name. It hurt to hear him say this because I've always respected my grandmother, even if I never met her. She was a lovely woman from what I hear from my dad's stories and I would've absolutely loved to meet her (same with my grandfather but he died when I was just a baby, so I have no lasting memories of him at all). I tried defending myself since being trans doesn't just mean transitioning physically, but also socially. Changing my name and my pronouns is part of that transition. Instead of listening, he started crying, screaming ""fuck you!"" at me and calling me a brat for being so disrespectful. Eventually, he stormed out to have a cigarette and cool off. The last thing he said to me that day after he came back was to not tell my mom about this. I locked myself away in my room and refused to speak to him for the rest of the week after that.

anyways heres the prob, yesterday she gets home at 4 n were outside. its now 5:15 im actively making dinner and she comes up from her room (i think she was napping) and says in a mean clipped tone “[sons name] you need to stop jumping” then closed her door in his face. now, i do get the jumping being annoying but its stimming for him i cant just make him stop (i do redirect we have a little trampoline and a big couch but i cannot do it every second) this made my little dude so upset he came to me crying and was so sad. well that got to me as mama and i had to say something.

34,1df7xke,AITA for not retaking the family photo since my DIL was not in it,"Every couple of years we get everyone together and do family a giant family photo. In total it is about 40 people. 

Our last one was in 2018 and we decided to do this again. I organize the whole thing and everyone was told that small pictures will be done at 4 and the big picture was at five. Afterwards we get dinner.

The issue is that my son and DIL were running late. Wasn't a big deal since it was just small pictures. They get here in time for the large picture. I asked everyone to be there on time. I called twice asking if anyone is missing. Everyone is lined up and the photographer takes like 15 minutes of the big picture.

Everyone is hungry and hurrying to get food. My DIL soon comes out asking about the picture. It is around 5:30 at this point. She told me that she was in the bathroom fixing her hair when the picture was being taken. She asked me to round everyone up again to get a picture


I told her no, that she was late coming to the event and couldn't care enough to actually be on time for the picture. I am not gathering everyone up again and paying the photographer an extra hour ( he was done and packing up at this point)

This caused a huge argument between her and me. My son is demanding I get her in the picture and I told him to pay someone to photoshop her in

38,1df736e,AITA for wanting money back from a friend who lost/destroyed my property they borrowed,"So I(17m) was friends with this one girl (who I’ll call Belle) for about a lil over a month. So to just get to the point we got close quickly; we exchanged sweaters and over time stuffed animals. All that stuff, I also gave her a couple other things to borrow, which we both agreed upon. For context we both work at the same job, me and friend helped her get the job. So basically last Friday we had a shift all together and I just wasn’t feeling it so I just didn’t talk to anyone during the entire shift(shift is abt 8hrs long). During that time our mutual and her were what I assume talking crap about me for whatever reason. Our mutual came up to me and said that Belle wants me to give the stuffed animals and sweaters to him; I was obviously fine with it and also stated that if that was the case then I would like all my stuff back. So at the end of the shift I just wanted to go home, nobody talked to me so I did the same and immediately went home after closing and everything. The next day our mutual called me weird for not driving Belle home since I usually did that but I just shrugged it off. Then a couple days pass and I get sent a message that one of my sweaters was thrown out by her dad because she left it to dry after her cat peed on it. I was pretty annoyed and was just going to ask for some money for it. So the next day I ask when she was going to give me my stuff back; she then proceeds to leave me on read not saying anything which kinda had me a little pissed off. Since not only did it not seem like she was going to say anything about my sweater that was thrown out but she wasn’t going to tell me when I should pick up my stuff. So I just said that I wanted some money for my sweater and that I’ll just pick the rest of my stuff up the next day during work and commented on how she just left my message asking her about my stuff on read. She then replies saying that she’s not paying since it’s not her fault and after that it just escalated quickly to her pretty much trying to attack me emotionally because I was refusing to back down on getting money for my sweater. I pretty much just left her on delivered since then and opted to communicating through our mutual since I was just done with her crap. I then figured out she’s been trying to bad mouth me to everyone I know, including our managers. It’s just annoying now, though last night I received my stuff and to my surprise when I open the bag I’m still missing some things so I just messaged her earlier about either bringing my stuff or to pay me.

39,1df70xu,AITA for only cleaning after myself and not doing more house chores?,"Due to financial reasons, I (F29) rent an apartment with my sister (F24). My sister is a real clean freak, I... not so much. I like when things around me are clean, but I don't really care about some mess in my room or dishes not standing perfectly even on the shelf. Whatever.

At the beginning, I tried to do my share of chores. Cleaning the bathroom, kitchen, all that jazz. However, no matter what, how long and how meticulously I was doing, my sister was always doing the same thing once again, correcting me. I washed dishes? She washed them again, because ""they weren't clean enough"". I cleaned the shower? She did it again, as ""I wasn't careful enough"". And so on. What's more, later she kept snitching to our parents that ""I never help her"" and am messy.

Mind you, I WASN'T using weaponized incompetence. I even started watching and reading tutorials how to clean things properly because I thought that it was a ""me"" problem. But it is not. Even our parents admit that she's obsessive when it comes to cleaning.

So, I stopped doing chores. It doesn't make sense for me to do them, if she re-does them after me, usually taking even more time. I make sure to throw out garbage when I see they're full, I wash my own dishes and clean after myself but that's it.

My sister says that I am the asshole as I don't help her and leave her almost alone with cleaning the whole apartment. She snitched to our parents and while my mother says that ""her cleaning behaviour isn't normal"" (verbatim quote), I should keep helping her anyway. But I don't see any sense in helping her if she corrects me EVERY time, taking even more time than I do. I consider moving out but due to financial issues there's no way that either of us will be able to do so any time soon.

Little background info. I have never been for lack of a better word a girly girl. I wear makeup for work or occasions but otherwise prefer not to. As for clothing I wear casual jeans, shorts, nice tops but nothing special. Unless it’s for work or again a special occasion.  

I was married at 18 and divorced in my early 40’s. Am quite happy with my single life. I go, do when and whatever I want. I like myself and being alone does not bother me.

I was married at 18 and divorced in my early 40’s. Am quite happy with my single life. I go, do when and whatever I want. I like myself and being alone does not bother me.

43,1df6qoc,AITA - I (31M) Refuse to Pay Parking Ticket That my GF (34F) Got With My Car,"I'm out of town and street cleaning comes on Friday. My car is on the street. I told her on Monday that my car is parked on the street and I will be gone and unable to move it. She agreed to move it for me.

Early Thursday evening, I reminded her to move the car. She agreed. Thursday night before bed, I reminded her again to move the car. She agreed and said she would do it in the morning. Friday morning, I texted her to please move the car. No response. She called me before she got to work, saying she did not move the car and that she is willing to split the ticket 50/50 with me since it is my car and ultimately my responsibility. I said I am not splitting the ticket.

Multiple reminders were given on multiple days. She explicitly agreed to move the car each time, accepting responsibility for the task. Moving the car is a simple task; she just had to pull it into the driveway 10 feet away and had ample opportunity to do it.

She hit me with, ""If someone broke into your car, would you expect me to pay for it?"" saying that it is the same exact scenario. I replied that this is a random occurrence out of our control, and I would never expect her to pay for that. Moving the car is a specific, simple request I made that she agreed to. It is completely different and unrelated.

If the roles were reversed, I would pay for her ticket as I took responsibility for the car while she was gone and had agreed multiple times to do so.

Anyway, she is mad that I'm not willing to split the ticket. AITA?

**TLDR:** I am out of town and parked my car on the street 4-5 days before street cleaners come outside my GF's place. GF agreed to move the car, with multiple reminders on multiple days.

44,1df6l9r,WIBTA if I declined to create a memorial tattoo? ,"Throwaway since I don't know who is on here. 

Background: I (60f) had neighbors who I was friends with for many years; lets call them Betty and Sylvester. Our kids were close in age and we would hang out quite a bit. We even went on vacations together. 

Sylvester seemed to have issues with me. He could be nice one minute then insult me the next. I started avoiding him but since we would all hang out at Betty's parents house I still saw him on regular basis. 

Some examples of Sylvester's behavior: he insisted we join  them in Mexico after my dad died ""Because you need something to smile about"". As soon as the plane landed Sylvester became a different person. He told everyone where to meet up for dinner except our family, he screamed at his wife and kids for inviting us to the pool, he offered my husband his side of guacamole then had a tantrum when my husband shared it with me, etc. It was an awful vacation to say the least. He would be the life of the party then after a few beers would become mean an insulting. Too many time I saw him make Betty and their two daughters cry. This kind of nice, then mean behavior was pattern that was exacerbated by his excessive drinking. Sylvester was a raging alcoholic that would get blind drunk every weekend. At one point in our friendship they got divorced. 

Sylvester blamed me for the divorce, blamed me for him having to move out, blamed me for everything. Whatever, he wasn't my ex so I didn't have to deal with him. Betty would tell me he was saying awful things about me to anyone who would listen. I would also occasionally hear from his older daughter. She would tell me that he referred to me as the devil and demanded that she stay away from me. This was usually done when he would drunk dial her. Of course that didn't happen. 

So years passed. I no longer spoke with Betty (we drifted, our lifestyles changed, that sort of thing). The older daughter moved out of state. Her and I stayed FB friends but that was it. 

I saw on FB that Sylvester died unexpectedly. I commented my sympathies but didn't reach out since I hadn't actually spoke to any of them in over 12 years. 

The older daughter just reached out to me asking if my husband and I (we are both artists with a speciality she is quite fond of) would mind designing a tattoo to commemorate her father using a cartoon Sylvester as the base. 

I feel very awkward using my skills to create something to honor a person that hated me. I mean he HATED me. Everything that happened to him was a result of his alcoholism but he made me the scapegoat. I talked to my husband about it and he doesn't want any part of it. 

TL;DR: a neighbor that I haven't seen in over 12 years just asked if I could create a tattoo to commemorate her recently deceased father. This is a man who openly hated me, insulted me and was cruel. I feel very uncomfortable working on a project like that but I do feel guilty saying no since she had no part in her father's behavior. 

So WIBTA if I politely declined?

45,1df68pm,AITA or are they the AH?,"For context, I have been extremely supportive of this friend who has ADHD for many many years. The diagnoses is later in life and has brought a lot of clarity to why this person behaves the way they do. However I would like to understand from the community how much of this is AH behaviour and how much is ADHD.

Some context:

Timekeeping:
Timekeeping has ALWAYS been an issue. As long as I have known this person they are minimum an hour late. Regardless of the event (including meeting for my birthday day out. Reason for being late that time.. she had seen a hairstyle online she wanted to try and it took her far longer than she anticipated.. an hour longer..)

From discussions, they do have the capacity to be places on time (work.. kids parties etc) but never for when we are due to meet.

Lately, I have tried to meet up with this person for almost a year and for one reason or another the plans fall through. So much so I missed spending time together for both their birthday and their kids birthdays.

Come to last weekend. A summary of what happened:

We were due to meet at 3 at a mutual location that was an hour for her and just under an hour for me. 

As she is routinely late (and I am sick of being on time and waiting) I asked her to let me know when she was leaving as it made sense for me to leave when she was on the road (as it would take me less time).

I waited and waited waited for the call.. nothing. 

I reached out initially had nothing, calls were ignored and was eventually given excuses as to why the lateness. 

She didn’t end up leaving home until 3:30, with little regard for me or my time or later plans.

The lateness pisses me off to no end but is just expected these days.

But the kicker was what happened when we were together.  She spent the entire time on her phone trying to sort out an issue at home (missing parts for a kids toy.. nothing critically urgent). So much so that we couldn’t even go into stores together because there was little signal. There was a lot of texting and “I am listening” which was just frustrating. 

I called it out and said “can’t your partner just deal with this” and she replied “that would be nice wouldn’t it” and carried on. 

Due to me having plans later in the day, we only ended up spending an hour and a half together that day.

When we said our goodbyes. I handed over the gifts for her and her boys birthdays I missed and we parted ways.

And now..I haven’t heard a thing.
No “thanks for the gifts, they loved them” no “it was amazing seeing you, we should do it again soon”. Just silence.

So I would like to hear from the ADHD community. How much of this can’t be helped and how much of this is just disrespect as I am struggling here to keep this up.

I have a lot compassion for her as I have lost both parents and I know the pain involved. I am sad for her pregnancy loss as well.

Recently she has wanted more support than ever before, which I understand due to the circumstances. I have tried to offer it. Most of the time I will stop what I'm doing even if it upsets my spouse, my kid, or whoever I'm with and I will call her. I've cancelled plans, gone over time on my 30 minute lunch break, I've stayed up way too late, I've been late to social engagements in an effort to be on the phone with her and support her.

I myself am going through a divorce. I was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer which was caused by not eating much due to anxiety. I'm not in a great place myself. 

My friend has recently gotten upset with me because I wasn't able to immediately fly and travel to see her the day after her unplanned surgery. Her husband was caring for her physically but she wanted more than just him while she recovered. She offered to pay for a plane ticket but my spouse was traveling and I had no one to watch our pets. I also had two doctors appointments during the days she wanted me there.

My spouse was not comfortable with hiring a pet sitter we don't know to be in our home. And with my doctors appointments, I told her I could fly to see her three days later than she wanted. She was not happy with my offer and viewed it as a rejection. She did not take me up on my offer to come see her when I was able. I checked on her daily and I sent a gift to her with minimal response. 

Next incident a few days later I had picked up my spouse from the airport, and we immediately had to go drive to our child's karate graduation. My friend called me and I answered in the car even though my spouse finds it rude to be stuck in the car while I'm on the phone. I spoke with her for 20 minutes then said I had to hang up because it was time for our kid's event. She understood but about an hour later texted asking me to call when I left the event because she needed advice. I explained in text that I was at my kid's event, and we were taking him out to dinner after and I would not be able to call that night. I offered to call in the morning before work, on my 30 minute break at work, after I got out of work, or all three if it would help. She responded telling me she needed a break from our friendship. 

Since then she ignored for days and then texted one line saying her father was dying. Of course I responded that I was sorry and I know how hard that is. After that she replied with a long text about how I've rejected her and she can't handle it.

I did my best to be there for her. Texting, calling, sending a gift. Offering to travel as soon as I was able. Offering to call her as soon as I was not in the middle of family obligations.

Since then she ignored for days and then texted one line saying her father was dying. Of course I responded that I was sorry and I know how hard that is. After that she replied with a long text about how I've rejected her and she can't handle it.

I did my best to be there for her. Texting, calling, sending a gift. Offering to travel as soon as I was able. Offering to call her as soon as I was not in the middle of family obligations. Am I the asshole?",0.0,0.0017249116208404303,0,1
50,1df5paf,AITA for not paying any more to my daughters Debs ball ?,"Ok , kicking off , in my time 20years back , we closed the 7th grade school year with a small function. Say an informal party/dance much like in many American programs. Music , snacks and a late night of innocent fun.

This year 2024 my daughters school has chosen to throw a formal Debutants ball . Dressing up , makup , coordinated dance events the whole 9yards. Participation trophy's for all attendants. 

Ok as a dad I want the best for my daughter and have bought in to the experience. We payed for her attendance ticket , payed for our attendance tickets , bought THE  dress , got her some cute costume jewelry and are currently looking for the perfect heels.

Yesterday my daughter came home from school with a 15page manual for the event. Couple of points that caught my attention were One the school is asking for equipment donations. Tables/chairs/table dressings and what not , each listed with the monetary value should a parent rather straight out pay for equipment. Each listed item ranging from the equivalent of 2 weeks pay to some at 1weeks pay. Ok fair enough they looking to make it special , I dont have that kind of disposable income and have already put a lot into this but maybe others will be able to help out.

Point two is when it really started sinking in for me. The manual goes on to explain how  children are encouraged to approach friends/family and local businesses to sponsor a ""special message of encouragement"" to be announced at the event and specific to the pupil for a fee , the larger the fee the more extravagant the announcement. 



My response at this point has been to sit my daughter down and explain to her the trappings of greed. How the school is clearly over exerting its position. She is to return to school after the holiday in general keep quiet but if pushed , explain how her parents are embarrassed at how desperate the school is to sell the children's end of year experience.

AITA for placing a hard limit on when I will stop opening my wallet for my daughter end of year event ?

I (he/him) am still in secondary school and am very close friends with this girl. However, she is like really insecure and overbearing icl.

In fact, I rarely respond to her texts at all (we still talk irl though). I did tell her to get professional help if it’s that bad and she even apologised at one point yet she still keeps doing it.

54,1df4ylu,AITA for telling my best friend that she shouldn’t have dated her ex?,"I, 15F, have a best friend that I love the most dearly named Aiza. She’s the same age as me, and we’re both at the end of our sophomore year. 

Our quarters are split in 4 because of our school district. Both of us were single up until 3rd quarter of the school year. Around the beginning of that quarter, I got a boyfriend, and he really suited me. We both started talking at the beginning of our sophomore year, and started dating. He likes the same things as me, and I love the same things as him;

However, my friend Aiza got a boyfriend in the last quarter, meaning she would have little to no time to get to know her ex. Theres obviously the summer, but her ex’s parents takes away his phone during the summer. Or so what we think. She starts talking to her ex boyfriend around the end of the 3rd quarter, entering the 4th. Her ex boyfriend, Amir is a well known bad kid in the school. It’s even gotten to Aiza several times as well. He’s known to be a troublemaker, and a heartbreaker to girls. Aiza was really being delusional, and thinking that he could potentially change for her. (Which was wrong)
They get out of the talking stage and enter the relationship. 

They both are not suitable for each other because they both have 2 different personalities, and styles. I’ve told Aiza plenty of times that he’s bad for her, and she always would shut me out and start to talk about how nobody expected me and my boyfriend to get together, and that we’re not good for each other to try to get back at me. This obviously hurt me, so I got plenty of evidence to show how delusional she was, and once on a call with her, me, my boyfriend and the ex boyfriend, he would say really rude things about her to me and my boyfriend while she would leave her phone for a while. We took this to heart and told her once we got off the phone. She was in clear disbelief about this situation and wanted proof. It was a facetime call, so we obviously couldn’t have provided evidence that he said it. 

Fast forward a week later when I tell her he’s not suitable for her.

We were walking around the beautiful beach, and she brings up her ex as a topic, so naturally I did too. I start to speak about how I don’t think he’s good for her and that she deserves much better because she was just carrying every girl’s hand-me-down. She took my comment offensively and started to say that I was acting like a bad friend, and started cussing at me, causing a scene. We left the beach so we wouldn’t cause any trouble, and she started to listen to the people that told her not to get with him. A day later, she catches him cheating in some random closet in the school and breaks up with him. I can’t believe that I got to tell her ‘I told you so.’ She told me to fuck off, and told me to have fun with my boyfriend. I sort of feel bad now..

55,1df4tdk,AITA for telling my partners friends they're bad friends and people,"I (24F), have been with my partner (23M) for around 18 months. He has a close friendship group consisting of around 7/8 guys who have all been friends throughout school - some of these friendships have been since they were 4 years old, but most of them are a good 10+ years old.

I can't OBVIOUSLY speak for every group of male friends, but I always find the dynamic of these groups is quite sibling like, especially when they have grown up together. They bicker and bitch about each other A LOT and are all quite different people outside shared interests in drinking, football and playing playstation. I see these guys genuinely every week and would call myself and them 'friends' now. 

We are all going to Marbella in a few weeks time, it was suggested as we got a little older, mostly between me and the other girlfriends, to do a big group trip as we all hang out together a lot and it saves that jealous/stressed out week while your partner is on a 'lads holiday'.

The issue is, my partner is the one that is used as the bait of all the jokes. When they went to Zante last year (only the guys went), they got him out of bed at 4/5am and threw him in the sea EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. Due to this becoming a running joke, the 3 of them that like to do it have made it a mission to tell me at every possible opportunity how this holiday will be no different.

I get its a lads holiday, and maybe i've ruined it slightly by adding women to the mix and doing a group one. But for a trip i've paid £1000+ for? I don't want to be awoken at 5am to men grappling in my bed? I also like to sleep naked.. which I have told them several times which is met with dumb jokes and 'i don't care im not looking at you' comments. 

My partner had tried to tell them no - they do not listen and do not care. So I told them myself as I'm slightly more aggressive in tone, which was just met with comments that I was controlling and boring? AITA?

56,1df4qzx,AITA for going after a promotion?,"I started in Fall 2023 working in the packaging department of a facility that manufactures medical products. Passed my probation period with flying colors and got offered another position to do in addition to packaging and happily accepted and have received many compliments for how I manage both tasks. Fast forward five months and two new positions opened up in the office. Positions like this opening are exceedingly rare due to how long the employees usually work at the company/hold their positions. One of the two positions hasn’t been vacant in 20 years, and both come with a hefty raise. Financially, whether I want the job or not, I’m not in the position to turn down any opportunity that would offer me more money. So when two of the three supervisors approached me asking if I’d be interested in applying, I jumped at the chance. 

After the official interview for the two positions today, the two other people in my department (one has been there for 24 years, the other for 3 years) won’t speak to me, and are openly complaining to anyone who will listen, including the aforementioned supervisors, about me. Their complaints come from how well the packaging department functions with the three of us, how helpful the other position I already have on top of packing is to the department, and how well we all get along. If I get the either of the new positions, they will have to train someone new, they’ll have to do the tasks I always volunteered for that they didn’t want to do, they don’t have the help from my other position, and it could very well put the department behind in production. They complained to a coworker today that they’re angry I’m “going after the jobs” and that “the supervisors are letting me go after them” and that if I get it I’m “taking the opportunity from people who have worked there longer and are more qualified”.

Now I’m feeling guilty for even applying for the positions because as a people pleaser, I understand the inconvenience me getting the job would have for them, but my husband is out of work and I have a one year old so money is tight and this could change a lot for me.

Am I the asshole or selfish for going after this job?

57,1df4eyn,AITA for telling my mom to put her dog up for adoption because of my allergies?,"About 2 years ago, my mom (39F) got my sister (17F) a dog as an emotional support pet, despite both me (14M) and my mom being allergic to dogs and common household pets in general (granted, my allergies are worse than hers). This wasn't a huge deal at first, as the dog would be small enough to fit in a cage and I generally didn't have to interact with it as much.

However, over the course of last year, things got worse, as the dog would be running around the house more frequently and is generally more free than before.

If you couldn't tell already, I don't get along with animals, especially dogs. In fact, I have a severe phobia of dogs due to traumatic experiences from my childhood (that my mom is very much aware of). I get PTSD whenever I'm too close to a dog and my heart starts racing (as silly as that sounds). And that really presented a problem since I'd frequently see the dog in various parts of the house and it usually starts running toward me. There'd be multiple occasions where I'd have full-on panic attacks because of it.

Even when not interacting with the dog, I'm still effected by it, as it sheds frequently and gets my allergies to act up. Not to mention the fact that the dog had been poorly trained, so it frequently urinates and poops on the floor and chews up anything in its sight (including stuff belonging to me).

The dog had very much effected my life to say the least, as I found myself spending more time in my room and only leaving it when I *absolutely* need to leave the house. I've pitched the idea of putting the dog up for adoption to my mom on several occasions, as other family members were clearly fed up with it too, but she seems to be the only one to wanna keep the dog and always got mad at me, saying ""if the dog went to a different family, it'll die"".

I understand getting attached to pets, but the fact that my mom made the decision to get a dog in the first place knowing that I infamously don't get along with animals baffles me, especially considering how out of the blue it was. I honestly feel betrayed that I wasn't considered while making this big decision and that my mom refuses to put it up for adoption. So, AITA?

(Edited to include paragraph breaks).",Not the A-hole,2024-06-13,"AITA for telling my mom to put her dog up for adoption because of my allergies? About 2 years ago, my mom (39F) got my sister (17F) a dog as an emotional support pet, despite both me (14M) and my mom being allergic to dogs and common household pets in general (granted, my allergies are worse than hers). This wasn't a huge deal at first, as the dog would be small enough to fit in a cage and I generally didn't have to interact with it as much.

However, over the course of last year, things got worse, as the dog would be running around the house more frequently and is generally more free than before.

If you couldn't tell already, I don't get along with animals, especially dogs. In fact, I have a severe phobia of dogs due to traumatic experiences from my childhood (that my mom is very much aware of). I get PTSD whenever I'm too close to a dog and my heart starts racing (as silly as that sounds). And that really presented a problem since I'd frequently see the dog in various parts of the house and it usually starts running toward me. There'd be multiple occasions where I'd have full-on panic attacks because of it.

58,1df495q,AITA: For driving into a parking spot at the same time as someone else? ,"I’m not really sure how to put the title. There were two parking spots, so neither car was without a space, but I was clearly in the one they wanted. 

I’ll try to keep this short and neutral (ish). I was parking and drove into a spot, at the same time as another car. The two spots were back to back, so the bonnets of our cars were facing each other. I didn’t think this was an issue until he got irate and threw up his arms telling me to  move. He’d clearly intended on driving through his spot and into the one I was in. I refused to move - we were both in a spot, we arrived at the exact same time. There was no way for me to know he was intending to drive through - I hadn’t even seen his car until I was in my spot because there was another car obscuring my view of his (not in a dangerous way). I just shook my head and said “Nope. That’s not how it works.”

He was clearly angry because the spot he was in had a car whose wheel was over the line on one side, and the trolley parking on the other. He could still fit but it was a squeeze to get out. 

I didn’t see this as my problem. Either one of us could have moved - he could have moved if he didn’t like that spot. But the way I see it, is we were in our respective spots, and if he didn’t like his, he could move. If I’d have intended to drive through into his spot, I wouldn’t have expected him to move because he was in that spot. 

Nothing else happened. Nothing else was said. This isn’t some major issue or ended in an argument or something. But I don’t know if I was actually wrong and should have just moved? 

AITA for not moving my car, when he was clearly angry? 

(Not relevant but I specifically didn’t move because I have a chronic illness, my joints are horrendous and pop in and out, and I was in pain, so chose a spot close to the doors. I don’t have a disability badge, neither did they. This wasn’t a disabled spot, just a regular one close ish to the shop. I have a sign on my car for any emergencies as it impacts care. They were older, but not old. Like maybe 50s. I’m not going to speculate on any mobility issues, because I probably looked fine to them. If I was having a less painful day, I maybe would have but I’m not convinced… )

I never really knew how their business worked or how they were able to afford such luxurious lifestyle despite being in a very competitive and low margin industry. Well my friend spilled the beans and it’s tax evasion + breaking labour laws. They don’t report majority of their cash transactions and keep the sales tax they hold and they also exclusively hire undocumented immigrants who have little to no leverage. Minimum wage in our area is $15/hour, they’re paying their workers $7/hour. They also don’t get overtime pay or benefits. 

It just rubs me the wrong way that his family was literally living such an excessive and wasteful life style while they exploited immigrants and pay less tax than me.

62,1df39wm,AITA for telling my sister how I feel?,"

I (30f) have 1 older sister 36(f) I will call Lyssa. Since childhood I've never really got along with Lyssa she was always doing things like lying, stealing, etc then blaming me. She always accused me of being the favorite and treated me badly because in her words my parents ""loved me more"" or I was the ""favorite child"". That was never my experience, I was always treated more strictly by my parents since she would not listen and was defiant. I can give a million examples of how different I was treated because of her but 2 always stick out. 
• Like when we were in private school and she failed all her classes and did summer school for 6 years before she got put in public school and I failed 1 class 1 year and was immediately taken out no second chances. 

•When my parents bought her a used car she begged them for, even after they offered her a brand new one and she refused, then eventually that car broke down and she blamed my parents. She got upset after they got a brand new car for me to use that I had to share with my mom while her car was just for her. 

(They have also given her thousands of dollars to help her with rent and other things and she never paid back, the few times they gave me any financial help I was expected to pay back every penny.)

She was always ungrateful and said my parents never helped her and they always helped me. And blamed them for all her problems and misfortunes even though everything was because of her own choices. So, after so many years of the same thing I finally told my sister I'm tired of her BS and I'm not dealing with her anymore that she needs to grow up and take responsibility. She got upset and blocked me on everything then blamed my parents for me not wanting to talk to her. And now she has decided to cut my parents off and they are suffering because they can't see my niece or nephew.

I feel like ITA because my parents have always tried to help her and keep in contact because their words ""she is our daughter"". But I'm tired of her lies, irresponsibility and toxic behaviour. And so told her off but now she is keeping the kids from my parents. They are suffering especially my dad as he has no other family.

Edit: Ok quick edit I realized the issue might seem confusing. The issue is my sisters treatment of my parents and also myself. She has always treated me badly by trying to manipulate me into feeling bad for anything I accomplished in life. Example when I graduated college she said my parents let me stay home and not work while she got a job so now it's their fault she never finished college. They told her to get a job because she was just drinking and doing drugs so they trying to keep her busy. She would manipulate the story to make me feel favored and my parents seem like bad parents. 

After I became a mom I realized the love my parents had for her and me. I just could not tolerate her treatment to them and I could no longer stay quiet just cause I wanted a sister bond that was maybe never gonna happen.

64,1df2v86,AITA… for not splitting my friend’s train tickets home after getting different flights due to missing our original flights home?,"AITA… for not splitting my friend’s train tickets home after getting different flights due to missing our original flights home?

Context - all 26F. We have just been on holiday and missed our flight home due to oversleeping. We woke up and I was panicking as I had work the next day so was looking at flights. I had originally found a cheaper option which would mean us getting a cheap coach to another airport meaning that we get the cheaper flight to a different city in our country, and that my partner would pick us up and drop us home. 

They didn’t want to get the coach even though it would’ve worked out cheaper for all of us, so I had to make a decision and found one seat on a direct flight home which would get me in earlier. This was okayed by two of them but one of my other friends said it was selfish. I booked the flight and then helped them find an alternative flight for the three of them. Splitting any of the costs wasn’t discussed or agreed at this point. 

I left for the airport and then got a message from one of them asking if I would be cool to split the costs of all the flights together. At first I wasn’t sure but had a think about it and decided it was fair as they got more expensive flights. My flight was delayed by 9 hours and they ultimately got home before me. They had to fly to a different city and get train tickets home for a 3 hour train. 

The next day I sent over the calculations of what I would have to send each of them but they weren’t happy as I hadn’t included their train tickets, but they would’ve had to buy transport home regardless of if we made our original flight (albeit the new train tickets they bought were more expensive). This wasn’t a cost agreed and now there is back and forth about what I should pay as they spent more on getting home. 

I didn’t choose the earlier flight due to cost, just to get home for my responsibilities as I had work the next day whilst they had an extra day off. Now I feel villainised for doing so, although they were okay with it at the time of me booking my flight. I feel like I’ve been more than fair in splitting the flights but the train was a surprise cost put on me. Before the holiday I hosted them the night before and my partner gave us a lift to the airport which saved us about £50-£60 in airport transfers and he also paid for the drop off cost. 

Am I the asshole for disagreeing with this? I struggle to set boundaries sometimes and feel a bit bullied into this. I feel like they have fallen out with me over this, which seems pointless as we have had a lovely holiday. Has anyone got any advice with this? I want to say no but I am struggling with advocating for myself here. 

UPDATE: As I said in the post, I’d split the difference and I’ll stick to my word but put my foot down at paying train fair. They flew off the handle and now today one of them is asking me to split their extra bag fee that they incurred because they flew with an airline that’s more strict with cabin sized bags.

I replied that I was just asking to understand and no need to be rude to which he replied ""you don't be rude either, fuck/fank you!"" I can't say for sure that he said fuck you given that he had a foreign accent and the bus engine is quite loud, but at this point I was just mad at how he was to me so i pulled the doors manually to open, forcing him to stop so that i could get off.

He asked if I was silly and I just said you didn't need to be rude to me and walked off.

66,1df2p6g,AITA for insisting on keeping an anthill in the apartment despite my roommates objections?,"I (27M) share an apartment with my roommate Alan (28m). We've lived together for about a year and usually get along fine. Recently, I've gotten into ant-keeping as a hobby. I've been reading a lot about it and decided that I want to start my own ant colony. I bought an ant farm kit and a queen ant with a few workers to start my hill. It started small, but it turned into several colonies and I was very interested and content.

When I first shared my excitement with Alan, he immediately started freaking out about the possibility of ants escaping and infesting the apartment. He has a daughter who comes over on weekends who is allergic to ants and is terrified of them as a result too. I tried to reassure him that I had taken precautions to prevent any escape, but he's been acting like i'm harboring a plague.

To appease him, I moved most of the colonies into my bedroom. He still wasn't happy. He makes snide remarks about my ""unusual hobby"" that could potentially ""send his daughter to her grave"" (what?). Last night he dropped the ball that if I don't get rid of it, i'll be forcing him to move out which I thought was unfair because I can't afford rent on my own and he knows that. He says he's equally getting screwed over since he has to pay for his daughter and a whole new apartment.

Honestly, I still think he's being unreasonable. These ants aren't harming anyone, and it's my space too. I should be able to pursue my interests and hobbies without Alan constantly nagging me and making me feel like a POS.

67,1df2frv,AITA for planning an out with my sister?,"I (F almost 17) live in my house with my dad (M56), mom (F53), older sister (F almost 30), and temporarily grandma (F74).  I have to keep it short due to the limit.

Let me give some context. We're not American, we come from a different country and I'm the only one in my family that was born in the US. 20+ years ago, my family had immigrated here to the US mostly for the sake of my sister to have a better education and better job opportunities, and they're staying here for me until I graduate college and get accepted into a good job. A specific thing to note is, in my culture we absolutely do not move out of our parents homes until we get married. It is not normal for 18 year olds to move out.

Last week, it's safe to say that shit hit the fan. My mom is known to be very pressuring no matter how much you try to tell her that she's crossing boundaries, and she crossed a big boundary of my sister's, causing an argument. My mom started her usual rant of ""you're being disrespectful, ungrateful, I have the right to yell at you because I'm older, you need to earn my respect"", and so on. Something important to know about my sister is, she's the most calm and collected person. She almost never raises her voice, but if she does (which is incredibly rare), you know you really fucked up. She finally had enough, and got mad at my mom, and now for days they haven't been talking to each other and ranting to each other to me.

As much as I love my mom, I don't blame my sister. For years, my mom would get mad for over the littlest things and would give us way harsh punishments that we didn't deserve. She's somewhat verbally abusive, and there's nothing we can do about it because it's so normalized in our culture unfortunately. She also guilt trips us if we ever mention just going away from home for a couple days to some place far away and she spit nasty words at me when I let it slip out of my mouth that I wanted to move out for college in an argument.

My sister and I have been slowly plotting a way to get out of the house once I do turn 18. We're both thinking about saving up some money to have a decent place where the 2 of us could live together. But lately I feel guilty for it because I don't want to leave my dad, who's innocent in all of us and unfortunately is tied down to my mom, and while we're mad at her, we still love our mom.

My (25f) and my friend, will call her Layla (29f) always go to concerts together. I have another friend who I will call Maggie (29f) who I've also gone to concerts + trips on. However, with Maggie, she does not like all of the same artists, so its rare to go with her. 

  
One of my favourite artist announced his tour date in my city so of course Layla and I had already planned to go. When I mentioned it in my group chat with Maggie, Maggie said she also wanted to go and to get her a ticket. I told Maggie I was getting the most expensive ticket and she said that she will match whatever I got. Ticketing went down, I got Maggie and I floor tickets, while Layla was only able to get lower bowl tickets because floor sold out. Everyone was happy, plans were made and Maggie said she would pay me in a couple of weeks. 

  
Within a week, Maggie and I's favourite band announced a world tour but the tour was not stopping by our city, so we would've had to travel. Maggie said she would travel to go see the band but that would mean that she could not go to the concert in our city (even though the ticket was bought already). This wasn't the first time Maggie would switch plans on me so obviously I felt some type of way. I assumed she would prioritize travelling over the ticket I had already bought. 

  
I called Layla and told her what happened and also offered her the floor ticket and told her that I could just give Maggie the lower bowl ticket instead if she still wanted to go (maggie still hadn't paid for the ticket). Layla said yes so I messaged my group chat with Maggie to tell her the new plans and tell her that this way, she can pay for a cheaper ticket and have the option to go to both since I felt like she was already flaking on our plan. 

  
Maggie started calling me aggressive and said I shouldn't have done that and that I shouldn't have assumed her plans. I said I only did it to make her decision making easier and that way she didn't have to stress. She went on a spiral in our group chat sending endless messages, I stopped responding because I started getting mad and I'm not the one to talk about things while mad, I like to let things cool down and talk when we're in a more reasonable state. But she kept messaging and messaging about it and then overall left the group chat and blocked me that same night.

I should also add my father has MS and says he can't travel to see us BUT he can travel across the country for poker tournaments.

I recently sent my father a gift for this birthday and recieved this text:
""GM [*redact*], Thanks for my present but you know what would be a better present seeing you and the kids. I just don't understand how you can't find a way to make time to see your mother and father. I know I wasn't the best father and I could have done a lot of things differently but I helped bring you into this world, took care of you always. You and [*brother*] and your mom were my priority and I didn't ever deviate from that. Tell me why there is so much hate between us , [*husband*] and you. Do we really deserve to be treated like we really don't matter? Keep all of these texts that I have sent you and after I am gone you can read them over again to realize how broken hearted I have been over this. And yes, WE are trying to be sensible and understanding but we only have one daughter and one life.""

I constantly recieve texts of this nature and am at a loss. I go back and forth between feeling like IATA and questioning if I deserve this for moving away. AITA?",0.0,0.011920263059437275,0,1
76,1df093m,AITA for asking my Dad for money?,"30 y/o F, living at home with family - So my parents got divorced a couple of years ago. The circumstances were complicated but my question more so has to do with my dad's financial responsibility...

My mom has been a stay at home mom my entire life and my Dad worked as the sole provider for the family. This was something they mutually agreed on.

When I was in 8th grade, we took in a lost cat. This cat has been in my family ever since but as he approached the age of 15, he got feline diabetes. As you can imagine, that comes with a lot of costs. At the time, my dad was still at home and so he was covering the costs of caring for our cat. But since he left the house and the divorce was finalized, he has stopped financially supporting the care for our cat. Regular care (checkups, grooming, food, etc), planned medical expenses (medication, diabetes supplies), and emergency medical expenses.

And because my Mom does not work and is unable to work, she is not able to contribute to the cat expenses. Therefore, these costs have fallen on me. And I'm not sure that is right, given that this was a family pet that we took in when I was only 12.

And my dad has just completely not acknowledged this element of the divorce. He essentially just abandoned the responsibility and left it for me to pick up the pieces.

My wife and I have been together for about ten years. This problem has finally come to a head and I want some outside perspectives. 

Long story short, our families have much different communication styles. I was taught to listen, respond, and then listen some more, and then respond. Conversation is a boat we row together. 

Her family, I don't know how else to put it, just talks. Like long stories that hem and haw and divert and occasionally converge. Everyone else plays on their phone and tosses out a grunt now and then, until they find an opening to tell their own long story. Then the cycle continues. 

I find this extremely, incredibly rude. Shockingly rude! But we only see them like six times a year so I shut up and browse reddit. 

Well, her mom finally asked why I'm so quiet when we visit. I'm usually really good at dodging, but she was kind of persistent about it, like ""no seriously, tell us how everything is going with you!"" This is the absolute first time she or her ex husband or her son (my BIL) have expressed interest in my life. 

I started talking about my big work project and, sure enough, they all just unlocked their phones and started playing, so I just stopped talking and watched the clock. A full two minutes went by before someone realized it was silent in the room.

88,1dey5pk,WIBTA if I refuse to be my sister’s digital art teacher?,"WIBTA if I refuse to be my sister’s art teacher?

Recently, my parents brought up the issue of my little sister (17F) wasting her time playing all day. They are saying that I should spend time to start teaching her digital art instead because she has an interest in it and that it’d be better than wasting time playing all day. We are 1 year apart. 

Frankly, I have no issue with teaching her a little bit except that they want me to give her my iPad which I bought myself for a few hours each day and when I buy a new one, to give her my old one completely. Now, this is a little problematic since I was planning to sell my iPad and put the money towards buying a new One. I bought my own iPad when I was 15 too anyways because no one else was willing to buy one for me. 

Another issue would be that I’m really bad at organising time. I go to the gym, work, study and read as a hobby. And that takes a major chunk of my time. My scheduled is not set in stone, I do things when I want to do them. Which is bad, but I can’t help It.

  
Sometimes I work, sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I laze around, sometimes I go hours doing something I find interesting. This freedom of time helps me to focus when it’s needed. It sounds weird, I know, could be something undiagnosed. I need this freedom though, and I can’t do anything if someone is using my device for hours. And also the fact that I’d have to actively teach her everything. It’d throw off my whole schedule.

Lastly, I have a principle that I don’t teach anyone who doesn’t seem passionate about it. I have had issues with people wanting to learn from me, but get bored and ditch midway. Whenever I teach, I teach fully and completely. It’s against my philosophy to get such a student that doesn’t want to learn

So WIBTA if I refused to? I already told my parents all these issues, but they are telling me that I’m being selfish. It’s not my sister, or my parents fault, it’s me. I just can’t handle it

Tldr; They want me to teach her and give her my iPad. I can’t because it’d take time, energy and mental space I’m not willing to give up

93,1dewyrn,AITA look at your phone,"I (35m) was in my home last night after a flight lesson. Called my GF (40F) and asked if she wanted anything to eat. She said yes and proceeded to tell me about her day.Normally she isn’t very talkative on the phone, but she proceed to tell me how work was stressing her out and how she’s wanting to get her nails done an how annoying her it is that her nail guy isn’t available anymore. 

I get close to home and ask what she wants to eat and she says sonic. Ok cool, I get there and they don’t have something she wants. So she starts texting “Wtf” “I cant” “ok WTH” “I cant catch a break” “stupid. I guess I’m not meant to have fries”. So, I text her “ I pull away and ask if she would like something else or sonic still.” She said “You could have parked in one of the drive up spots”

 I said “Ehh not in Big hurry. I was just watching the cars pull up while I was blocking the speaker lol” she gives me her new order and I pull back through and let her know it will be a minute there are 3 cars ahead of me.


Now, when I get home I walked in and was like “woooo I’m tired that was a rough flight and a long day at work after spilling coffee on myself lol”

We sit down to start eating and I was retelling the events at sonic because I thought it was funny. I looked at her and said ”but someone couldn’t answer me quick enough so I had to pull away” sarcastic. Instantly she blew up “you don’t think I know that, I don’t keep my phone in my face all day I was working. You send me updates constantly about your day so I don’t waste my time looking at my phone every time you message”. This was a shot because when I’m home I’m either studying on the iPad or playing on my phone while she finishes work (WFH) or does stuff around the house like get her clothes ready, makes her snacks for the next day, does her laundry.

She had asked me to let her know when I’m leaving sonic to take the dog potty so we could eat when I got home. Is it unreasonable to assume that she should be paying attention to her phone when she specifically asks me to let her know something, so that we can be on the same page? AITA?

*I want to be clear when she isn’t doing anything, I make it a priority to stop studying or playing on my phone to spend time with her. I use to follower her room to room having conversations while she did her things, but I am going to school now so I have to find time to study plus after working/school from 4am-8pm I want to unwind and relax instead of walking around and following her.*

I could hear my other neighbors asking them to keep quiet, but they weren't shutting up, so I called the police. 

The police came, and I guess things escalated because they arrested one man.

The next day, I could see Facebook posts in the neighborhood group, and surprisingly, the rude and mad comments were directed at a person who had called the police (me lol).

I figured out that it was someone’s birthday.

just so you have a better understanding, I’m translating one post from that group: 

“when the dogs are barking and howling all night long, you don’t seem to be bothered and you are mad over sounds of fun and happiness? people are so unfair, May God bless you with many loud birthdays George!”


Today, a woman came to my door, visibly upset (I could see her through the peephole). I didn’t open the door. She somehow figured out who called the police, and I figured she's the wife of the man who got arrested. She was calling me names and saying that I wouldn’t be at home forever, and I'll get my share of fairness. Kinda sounds like a threat if you ask me.

Am I the asshole for calling the police?

Should I apologize?

95,1dew8wr,WIBTA if I apply for a job I helped a colleague apply for?,"I am in a very personal dilemma at the moment. Recently my company has gone through a redundancy process and many colleagues have been left without a role to go back into with the company.

I luckily have found a role within the company’s new system and am settled prior to beginning this new job in a few weeks time. My colleague who we will call Sarah, didn’t apply for any internal roles and was happy to take the redundancy and leave.

Last week all teams were informed a role was freed up as the original person who held that position had been promoted. In office Sarah told me she was applying and after some time had regretted not applying for the other internal roles.

I helped her put her application together and proof checked answers to questions to make sure she was prepared and in the best position to get the role. The problem is after she left I was speaking with a member of the team with the opening who told me they were hoping I would put in an application as they felt I would be a good fit.

I informed them I wasn’t sure as, although the role is enticing and fits my skill set, I had helped a colleague without a confirmed role apply and I had a job lined up already. Their response was that they could understand but I need to look out for myself and if this role is better for me then I should go for it.

I took the time to think it over and it was definitely a job I would have taken in a heartbeat had I not been made redundant or secured a new job. They are adamant they would like me to apply but I already feel guilty even thinking of applying, let alone doing it after helping another colleague with her application.

WIBTA if I apply for this job and potentially take it from this colleague?

TLDR - My friend/colleague has gone for a new job and I have helped her. Her job gets made redundant soon.

96,1dew0hy,AITA for making my cousin look bad in front of her firends?,"I and my cousin became very good friends four years ago and I really like her a lot. She helped me overcome a period of self doubt and anexiety and in turn I helped her, when she was struggling with a toxic relationship. In general I am an introverted person (more ambivert) and she is really extroverted. So she helps me coming out of my shell and living in the moment and I help her to be more rational and this works really well for us.

So before I say some negative stuff about her, I want to make clear that she is a good person with good values.

The problem I have with her, is that she is very chaotic and unreliable. Here are a few examples:

- She suggests to make a vacation trip and then does none of the planning, so me and her friends have to book and plan everything for her.
- She forgot or lost her passport three times when we were flying with her and we have to deal with it.
- She is not on time very often. Sometimes she is over an hour late, even when she is the driver.
- We have to keep an eye on her all the time, otherwise we loose her (for example at concerts).

The other thing is, that she is always glued to her phone. Everything must be an Instagram story and she always has to look good. When she looks into her phone, the world around her vanishes. You can't even talk to her. It's as if you don't exist.

We were driving with a group of cars to go hiking. I was the lead driver and she was my passenger and I told her to enter the destination into the navigation system on her phone (it was her car). Everyone was waiting for me to drive and she was typing on her phone. Initially I thought she was searching for the destination, but it turns out she was writing with a friend. I told her a second time but she was still chatting. I got so annoyed that I told the others over our walkie talkies that she is rather chatting than doing navigation duties. She then snapped out of her phone zombie mode and entered the destination.

We arrived at the mountain and started hiking. The conversation turned to funny stories and I was telling two stories where my cousin forgot about me. The first story was a few days before the hike, where she called me if I wanted to visit her and if I wanted pizza, since she was ordering and I said yes. Then she immediatley forgot about me and ordered only pizza for her and two other friends. The other story was when she called me and she said she would pick me up at the train station only to immedialey forget and after half an hour waiting I called her and then she remembered that I was waiting.

After the trip she told me, that she was really hurt, because I was making her look bad in front of her friends. We talked about it and I told her my point of view. She apologized for overreacting.

99,1deusg5,AITA for not replacing the neighbour's fence?,"I know most people on here are from the US and I'm not so I'm going to outline how things work with fences in my country in case it's different (it may not be). Where I am, where a fence is between two properties, one of the properties is responsible for ""maintaining the boundary"". That does not mean that they legally need to put up a secure fence but the boundary must be marked in some distinctive way. The people who are responsible for maintaining a boundary will be the legal owners of the fence/hedge/whatever that they put there. Standard practice is that you install a 6ft high fence and ensure it is fully secured unless the style of garden would indicate otherwise. 

Imagine there are three houses: A, B, C and D - all in a row. We live in C and own the boundary between C and D. We have installed a fence between C and D that has no gaps and is secured - that is standard practice. House A owns the boundary between A and B - last year, House B fell out with House A because House A did not maintain the fence fully and a gap allowed for House B's dog to escape into House A's garden and subsequently out onto the street. Eventually, House A replaced the fence and the garden was then secure - but the relationship didn't recover and House A and House B don't speak. House B also don't speak to us (House C). We returned House B's dog to them if we found it out when it was escaping. Now, the fence between House B and House C (owned by House B) has holes in it which allows their dog to get into our garden and our dog to get into our garden (neither garden allows them to get into the street, just between the two gardens).

The neighbours are refusing to repair their fence to stop the dogs getting through to each other's gardens.

That is true - under the law, we are expected to ensure our dog stays on our property and we do not have a rabbit but, equally, we purchased a house where the garden was fully enclosed so that our dog wouldn't escape and could be left with garden access but the neighbours have failed to maintain this. I also think they're being hypocritical because, firstly, they also have the same legal obligation to keep their dog on their property and aren't doing so plus they fell out with House A because House A were doing exactly what they're doing now.

Before my brother left he warned me not to take the dog up on the couch, because the dog sheds a lot. Keep in mind we have a white sofa. We were both chilling in the living room (me on the couch and the dog on the carpet) and I suddenly wanted to get some water. I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water and when I came back I saw the dog on the couch, snuggled up in my blanket laying on a white pillow. Me being nervous quicly got him off of the bed and cleaned the pillow with a sticky roller. Then I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and when I came back I saw him on the couch having an extreme gag reflex. I quickly ran, jumped over the little table in front of the couch and dropped him off of the sofa. Keep in mind that in the living room, there is a big, thick carpet in front of the couch and on the right side there is just wood flooring. I dropped the dog so that he could vomit on the wooden flooring and he litteraly turns around and does it on the carpet. I panicked and quickly called my brother and told him what was going on.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-13,"AITA for not being quick enough to pick my dog off of the couch when he was about to throw up? Me - a 17 year old boy, was at my brothers aparment (25) and was alone with his french bulldog. Before my brother left he warned me not to take the dog up on the couch, because the dog sheds a lot. Keep in mind we have a white sofa. We were both chilling in the living room (me on the couch and the dog on the carpet) and I suddenly wanted to get some water. I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water and when I came back I saw the dog on the couch, snuggled up in my blanket laying on a white pillow. Me being nervous quicly got him off of the bed and cleaned the pillow with a sticky roller. Then I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and when I came back I saw him on the couch having an extreme gag reflex. I quickly ran, jumped over the little table in front of the couch and dropped him off of the sofa. Keep in mind that in the living room, there is a big, thick carpet in front of the couch and on the right side there is just wood flooring. I dropped the dog so that he could vomit on the wooden flooring and he litteraly turns around and does it on the carpet. I panicked and quickly called my brother and told him what was going on. He then started screaming at me at the top of his lungs, scolding me for even letting him on the couch for as little as a millisecond.

This was hard and my mental health started to take a dip so I told her and I backed off a bit, messaging when I can but not being round as much as normal. In May was her and her daughter birthday and I got them both gifts and I went round and every everything seems fine. A few days later I got a message and she basically said she was cutting me off because I wasn’t there for her. I responded and said I was trying my best to be there for her while also juggling work and my own mental health and my physical health she ignored my message, and I just continued with my day. A few weeks later was her birthday and I went round and brought gifts and everything seemed fine. we’ve been out since she called me. Things went back to normal.

110,1desk5o,AITA for asking my boyfriend to skip one family supper with his family to join my family's?,"For context, I (F, 21) had told my boyfriend (M, 22) that my dad had invited him to this upcoming father's day dinner with our immediate family. My boyfriend has told me he can't come because his mother isn't letting him. She said to him that the supper is the only time all the family spends time together. Keep in mind that the dinner I'm having on father's day will be at the same time as their supper, and that she doesn't want to break this tradition. Plus, if they were celebrating father's day, I would understand, but it's just a regular supper. Mind you, my boyfriend has supper everyday with his family.

A couple of pointers: so he has told me that his mother fears that, once the door to 'skipping' dinner opens, it won't close back. I had told him it's not like you have an inability to say no to things when it comes to my family dinners or/and gatherings. I had told him it's the first time we invite you on the one day everyone is available for once. I told him I'm always the one adjusting my schedule/our hangouts around his own family's regular suppers (and hence his schedule), and it's not like there was one time when I stopped him to go to his regular suppers (unless we hung out in the evening and ate together) because I respect his family dynamic and how 'tight-knit' his family is; His mother is almost always somewhat involved in a reason of why he can't do this or that (i.e. him leaving early from our hangouts) when there's no real need or emergency for it. I am tempted to say he is a mama's boy but he also is smart enough to know when she's bullshitting yet he still follows on some of her ridiculous ideologies (i.e. supper as 'tradition' for skipping the one supper out of 365 suppers a year); the fact that she won't allow him to skip once supper is to me ridiculous, it's only once, like lady let your son live his life, goddamn.

We have been together for > 6 months, and I understand his family might be a bit more strict than my family. However, I have met his mom a few times, and we chit-chatted. I don't understand the need for the mom to constantly be a barrier like this. I told him exactly "" if the regular supper is more important than seeing my immediate family that don't gather often, then I see where your priorities lie."" I would be more understanding if the reason of refusal came truly from him rather than from his own mother.

I've been having problems with his mom's behavior that is very subtly controlling imo. I can still notice at times she can be a difficult person in letting him do things with me, almost as if she feels threatened by my presence, like she's too scared to let go of her 'poor and precious boy'.  It's almost as if my bf his mother's puppet. He says he's progressing against this but I don't think he's doing so in this context because why couldn't he make her understand why this was so important to me??

We had planned a special dinner for his daughter for her birthday at a restaurant for her but we had to bump the time back due to other things. So while we were there with us, the kids, my parents, his mom, his cousins and their kids, my brother and sister, his ex wife texts him.

My bf says she can call right then so she does. Willow and her brother are total mama's girl/boys. So when she's on the phone they're ignoring everyone else there. My grandmother tried to talk to Willow and Willow completely ignored her and kept talking to her mom (and my bf didn’t even put the phone on speaker he just handed it to her so I have no idea what her mom was even saying) and eventually after a little over probably five minutes I tell Willow to hang up the phone.

113,1deryrb,AITA for telling my family it was wrong to eat my cake?,"I (18f) live with my dad(50m), mom(49f), and brother(10m). for context I spent hours making a cake for my Boyfriend(18m) as a present. It was the best cake I have ever made and i was extremely proud of it. when I made it i told my family to not eat it, and to ask me if they wanted some. i mentioned it multiple times and they all agreed and promised they wouldn’t. this was a very important cake to me and since it was technically my boyfriends i didn’t want them eating it without permission. 

when i gave my boyfriend the cake he loved it and it was a really nice moment. fast forward to today( a day later ) i was still telling them to not eat it. i had decided to go to my boyfriends house and hang out there today, i trusted my family to leave the cake alone as they new how much it meant to me and they told me they would leave it alone. me and my boyfriend had a good day but when i had gotten home i realized a whole chunk of the cake was gone. i got upset because the part they had eaten was the part with his name( that was the part i specifically saved for him ) 

i went to my brother and dad and i asked them if they had eaten it and my brother told me that he had LICKED the frosting of of part of it. so basically the cake part was just thrown away or someone else ate it. i got upset and said that he should have asked me, but my dad got defensive and said that it was my fault for keeping it here and if it was my boyfriends i should have taken it to his house. i said that i was just mad because i had told them specifically to ask me and they still didn’t listen. he started yelling at me and calling me rude and selfish and saying i was being over dramatic. i told him i wasn’t and that i was allowed to be upset, but then my mom yelled at me and was asking what was going on and when i told her she said it was stupid and i was being over dramatic and said i was choosing my boyfriend over my family.

i feel like they should have understood why i was upset and not have eaten it without asking in the first place but i don’t know AITA?

114,1ders5c,AITA for asking my partner to choose between me and a former friend of mine that he is now close to?,"THIS POST IS EXTREMELY SHORTENED. 

My partner and I share a mutual friend, someone I used to be close with, but over time, my perspective of her changed because of incidents that led to feelings of discomfort and jealousy.

The situation became uncomfortable when she stayed alone with my partner in our apartment while I was abroad for work. Although we had previously invited her to stay if she returned to the country, her being there alone with him made me uneasy. The discomfort escalated when, on New Year’s Eve, I saw that my partner had texted her “I love you.” While he explained that he says this to his other female friends as well and I was okay with that but with her I couldn’t shake off the unease I felt. 

I had an argument with a waitress, which embarrassed him. He walked out with her, leaving me behind with our other friends. She sat behind the driver’s seat and started playing with my partner's ear and hair, which I felt was a boundary being crossed. My partner also went out of his way to pick her up despite usually hating traffic. 

After a two-month work trip, we attended a party where she had a go at him for not inviting her and spending less time with her now that I was back. This upset both my partner and me. She once gave my partner a leg massage in the presence of colleagues and friend, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable when he told me about it.

My partner shares her IG stories when tagged, but rarely shares mine, dismissing my posts as too cheesy. 

A year ago, my partner added her to our Apple Family and Amazon accounts. When I noticed it, asked him about it, he responded that she didn't have enough storage on her phone, and it was not a big deal since he paid for it anyway. I let it go, but it has continued to bother me, especially since their falling out temporarily relieved my anxiety, only for her continued use of these accounts to trigger my discomfort whenever I see her name or orders.

Recently, I saw her message pop up on my partner’s phone, which made my heart sink and left anxious. I told him about my feelings, and he assured me he wouldn’t message her anymore. However, when another message from her appeared the other night, I felt the same intense discomfort, sparking an argument between us. 

He doesn’t like choosing because it would be uncomfortable for him to explain to her that I’m not okay with it. He argued that her using those accounts doesn’t affect us since we don’t use half of the Apple Family storage and she pays for her own Amazon orders.

I understand that my partner doesn’t like being forced to choose between friends and me, but this was the only situation I’ve asked him to because I just couldn’t take it mentally and emotionally anymore. 

So, AITA asking him to remove her? Am I being petty and irrational? Am I wrong to feel jealous and uncomfortable about a friend I used to be close with?

My mum has been a single mother for a while now trying to support me, Money has always been very tight for the 3 of us but our mum has never made it obvious when we were growing up she is truly an amazing mum.

in recent years me and my sister have finally gotten old enough to help support us all now and even take some nice trips out for dinner (which me and my sister will pay for) however cause of our money problems we haven’t had a trip as family in ages and even my mum hasn’t had a break in 8 years so we discussed having a family trip and we would be able to save in a year if we all bought our own tickets. 

Now heres were I think I could be the Asshole cause of being very less fortunate money wise as a lot of my friends I never really got to get anything when I wanted unlucky them and it stuck with me (which is silly) so when I started to make my own money I’ve been terrible at saving and will splurge which I know is a problem. But I love my family and know how hard it’s been for all of us so I have been saving and I’m on track to have enough money and even some extra for a trip.

the issue is I’m not saving for the trip I have never been saving for the trip. I’m saving for my dog called Nala she is a Rhodesian Ridgeback (very expensive dogs usually but we got her for free) she was free since she was going to be a breeding dog but she has a terrible hip injury where her leg isn’t even in the socket and has been fused together further down her pelvis (will show images of request) she is in constant pain not unbearable but she will whine when walking sometimes and cries a lot well sleeping. 

I have been saving to hey her hip replacement which will cost around 10K (this is in Australian currency) which cost about 4x the amount i’m spending on this trip with my family, cause of this I don’t really want to spend on this trip me not going won’t financially cost my family anything however I understand how much they love me and would love to have our first family trip.

with where i work i’ll be able to save for my dogs surgery by the start of 2026 which is already a while but that’s only if I don’t spend anything on the family trip I don’t want to my dog have this pain any longer then she has to by 2026 she will be 5 so by the time i’d save for it with the family trip expenses as-well she would of lived half of her life with it.

but at the end of the day I have truly no one I can blame but myself for not being able to control my spending impulse earlier. so Reddit am I the Asshole

117,1der2k0,AITA for making my science fair partner cry?,"Hello, I (14 f) just graduated middle school and in 8th grade we had to do a mandatory science fair project. My (then) friend (14 f) comes to school and asks me if she could work with me the day after I came up with a project. We were really close at the time, so I agreed. I ended up doing all of the work, I had to grow the plants, do the majority of the background research, collect the data, make the graphs, put together the notebooks while she did practically nothing! She missed a lot of school during the time we worked on the science fair project (edit: there was online stuff I asked her to do outside of school, which I understand, if she was out with something bad, she may not have been able to work on it, but this was during the time she claimed she felt better.) The day before Thanksgiving break was the last day to work on the project in the classroom, I was rushing to put together the board because a fire alarm went off and took up half of my science period. While I was working on that she was copying the information from my science fair notebook into hers and talking to the people behind us. For context I was standing at the table in front of them because the board and papers took up all of the space.

As I was cutting some of the paper for the board, the person she was talking to asked me if I would rather have another partner for this project, I answered honestly and in the nicest way I could saying ""yes I would have rather worked alone or someone who works at my pace"" (I hated waiting until the last minute to do something while she sometimes procrastinated). I turned around because I wanted to get the rest of the work done, when I heard her mumble under her breath ""bitch"". I had had it with her, I hated the fact that I did all of the work for a project that took up 70% of our grade, so I turned around and said to her in an assertive voice ""I don't know why you're talking I did all of the work for this project, while you did absolutely nothing. Whose notebook are you copying right now because I know it's not yours"" I turned back around and continued to cut and started to pack up the board and everything because it was almost time to leave when I hear her start to cry. I did honestly feel bad for her, but I heard from my other (then) friend (also 14 f for the 1000th time) that she was just embarrassed because the two boys behind me were messing with her after that.

We ended up making it to states (she didn't even know what our project was about the day before we went to state science fair) and winning an award and $50 (I was not credited for the project; she was the one called on stage and she was the one who got the $50).

I recalculated gas+wear and tear per mile with AAA numbers. That number is about $164. Most ppl I ask say I’m already being generous with $100.

I’m thinking about telling her dad that I actually want $200, b/c I’d be losing $64 at $100, and I’d be losing the opportunity cost of working.",0.0,1.0539121627807617,1,0
121,1deqfuy,AITA for not picking up more shifts because my bf pays for a lot of stuff even though it’s physically tiring for me?,"
My bf (25M) and I (19F) just got into a huge argument because he said I’m always thinking about myself and not putting myself in his shoes for not picking up more shifts as a server for 4 days in a row. I live with my mom btw, this isn’t a situation where we live together.

I am a server at a huge restaurant, part-time since I am a college student. I usually work 3 days a week. My shifts are very tiring as they require me to walk around for 8-9 hours, lift heavy things, stand, deal with rude customers, you name it. I go in at 5 PM usually and leave at 1 in the morning, and my mother waits for me to make sure I get home safely.


My bf works full time at a furniture.Every single time we go out, I offer to pay but he denies because I “don’t have enough and will be even more broke if I do help pay” (Even though I do have enough). Earlier, I told him that I was going to start picking up shifts because I needed the money. I am already scheduled for 2 days to work this week, and since I am offering to pick up another day this week, that’s already 3. One of my coworkers asked me about an hour ago if I can pick her shift up tomorrow, that’s already 4 days back to back, which is extremely tiring for me. I told him that she asked me and he said you should pick it up, and I said I wasn’t too sure about 4 days in a row because it’s extremely tiring for me.

He then proceeds to tell me how he’s annoyed that I said that. I said “You don’t understand because you’re not a server”. He used to be a manager at a retail store, so he replied with “Yeah your server job is a million times harder than running a business, my bad”. “I’m over here making sure I can pay for everything, but you can’t work 4 days straight, unbelievable”. He goes on to say “You’re complaining about working an extra day and acting like you work such a laboring job like I don’t run around lifting 300lb sofas on a daily basis”. I then proceed to tell him how he is invalidating my feelings and is not thinking about my physical health and how it’s tiring for me to work 4 days straight, and I tell him how I am putting so much effort into our relationship but he tells me how I’m not and I’m just thinking about myself. I told him that I try hard in our relationship and if he doesn’t think so, I don’t know what to tell him. He said “If that’s your excuse, then please don’t contact me till you fix that way of thinking. I’m not replying back till you sort yourself out”.

I just can’t tell if it’s wrong of me to not pick up more shifts even though it’s so tiring for me, and he tells me how I’m not thinking about him. I’m just really upset right now, and can’t believe he said I only think about myself, while I literally tell him it’s tiring for me to work 4 days straight :( Am I the a-hole?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-13,"AITA for not picking up more shifts because my bf pays for a lot of stuff even though it’s physically tiring for me?

124,1depztu,AITA for refusing when my friend wanted to join my fiance and I on our first trip together?,"
I (22F) and my fiance (23M) are going on our first trip together. I'm really excited as this is my first time on a plane, and even leaving the state I've lived in my whole life. We've been planning for this trip since earlier this year, and we've gotten our tickets as well as accommodations. All together, we've already spent about $4500 USD on everything, which has been something we've been saving for as we're both college students. Our trip is in about a month, and in comes my friend, we'll call her Ashley (22F), who's been my friend for about a year. She'd brought up going to Japan as well, kind of jokingly, when we told her about the trip. I didn't think she was serious, but then she brought it up a few more times, even saying that she had a family member she could stay with. She asked if she could spend some time during the days joining us on our adventures while this family member was at work. I was supportive of this idea, as I know this would be her first time to Japan as well, and I care about her. However, all of a sudden, she told me she wanted to get the tickets, but her family member no longer would have space for her to stay. She wants to know if she can stay in our accommodations and join us on our flight back home. I let her know that our accommodation has strict rules against having more than 2 people, and there's only one small bed in this studio. She said she'd be fine sleeping anywhere on the floor or couch, etc. I told her that I'd feel more comfortable if we didn't chance a fee or getting in trouble in general, as I really just want a comfortable stay. I told her that we're still willing to spend time with her during the day, and I began sending her accommodations in her budget. I was hoping this would be enough. Instead, she's just asking if we can cancel our accommodations and pay for larger accommodations that can have a bed for her as well. Mind you, she's not saying she will help us pay for the more expensive accommodation or anything else for that matter. She simply just wants to stay with us and for us to pay for a different accommodation. It seems like no matter what I say, she just keeps trying to manipulate me into letting her stay with us. This is also hard cause I know my fiance and I really wanted this to be a romantic trip for us both, as we likely won't be able to afford another for a few years as we finish school. I'm just stuck on what to say or do, and if I'm the asshole here. Should I be okay with my friend staying in our accommodation and joining in on our trip?

Update/ Note: As I'm reading the comments, there's a lot saying that I should be upfront about it being a romantic trip. When I first told her about the trip, I did tell her this is basically going to be our honeymoon. I may have said it jokingly to her, but I did mean it. My fiance and I have been talking about going to Japan since we got together 8 years ago. I thought this honeymoon comment as well as me bringing up activities like making our anniversary cake at a shop in Kyoto - clearly set the tone in which I planned this trip to be. I do agree that I should reclairfy that this is a romantic trip, but I feel uneasy that she'd receive this well, as she's shut down all my logical reasons.

I was hesitant when she brought up spending some time with us, but I thought maybe it was just something nice to do? I get that's a romantic trip, but my fiance was fine with it and supported her coming along on some of the more normal things like going to universal, since it was only going to be a few days of our trip (like 4 out of the 30+ days we'll be there) that she'd want to be with us. She originally said she'd only be in japan a week, and she'd only need to be with us while her family members at work from 7am-5pm ish. But now, things have changed, and she's saying it could be longer. 

I do have trouble with boundaries, and I always want to be the one helping people out when I can- which doesn't seem to work out for me, but I'm working on it. But, as she has been pushing for the last few hours no matter what I say, I've been getting more upset. I just didn't know if I was being selfish towards a friend in need. Now, I can definitely see that this was probably the plan all along, and she isn't in a tight spot. She just wants to use us. This realization does hurt as I thought we had gotten really close in our shared major, but I guess she really doesn't care about my feelings like I care about hers cause ultimately I just didn't want to hurt her. She recently got dropped out of our major, so I thought she was just really sad and needed a pick me up.

UPDATE:
I ended up refusing for the 10th time but told her no bluntly and as clearly as possible. As you guys have said, ""no"" was a sentence used. I also made sure to say that I wasn't down with changing anything and that I want to spend time with only my fiance. That I've been trying to nicely say no, but I don't appreciate getting manipulated nor having my partners and I's feelings ignored. She said, ""we've been talking about this trip for so long. Why didn't we just work it out earlier? It's not my fault that this is last minute. Why won't you just do this one? It's not much different, but there's an extra bed. "" and sent me a link to a specific accommodation. (Where the 2 beds are side by side just BTW, I'm weirded out.) She basically ignored what I said, so I have ignored her since. We're in the same friend group, so I think it's probably going to get weird. But honestly, I'm okay with that. Regardless of how that goes, my fiance and I will be going alone and not meeting up her or anyone anywhere during our trip. 

I'm going to work on the saying no thing and setting harder boundaries. I just had an abusive upbringing, and I'm still working on it all. I keep needing to remind myself that I'm not in that place anymore.

125,1depz55,AITA for asking my partner to choose between me and a former friend of mine that he is now close to. ,"So this issue has been going on and off for over a year now.  I have voiced it out to him multiple times but he always sided with her. 

My partner and I have a friend. She used to be a girlfriend I used to hangout with. But my perspective of her changed over time. 

A lot has happened that made the feeling of uncomfortableness and jealousy. 

1. She stayed with my partner in an apartment when I was away in another country for work. Yes, we did invite her to stay with us if ever she came back to the country. That made me uneasy, but then I tried to shrug it off. But the thought just kept pushing its way to the surface. I mean, we did invite her to stay with us if she is back in the country. But I hoped, she just messaged me that she was staying there and asked if that would be okay because it's just her and my partner. Meh idk it probably just a me problem. Even our friends, clocked on it but I played it cool. This is where the uncomfortable and jealousy started. 

I voiced it out to my partner, and we had a huge argument over it. Because he couldn't get why I started feeling that way towards her. He flew me back to the country to celebrated New Year and talked about it in person. We did talked it out and he even got me and her to talk in a restaurant. I felt so little that moment, yes I maybe irrational and emotional they both did made valid reasons during that talk but the uncomfortableness and jealousy is still there.

2. Then came New Year, I saw him text her ""I love you"", I did not bought it up during the moment because I froze and my heart ached physically. And the we talked about it and he showed me that he says I love you to his other girl friends that was okay for me I didn't feel uneasy when he showed me those messages to his other girl friends, but with her I just couldn't shrug it off. 

3. Whenever my partner and I had an argument before they had a falling out, he always go to her. They would go for dinner and do activities. 

4. One time we went to a club, I got into an argument with a waitress because the way she handled us. My partner got embarrassed of my attitude, and he walked out with her leaving me inside the club with our other friends. I felt hurt when I saw him walking with her in the hallway being so close. 

5. Same night we went out, she was sitting behind the driver's seat and she started playing with my partner's ear and hair from behind for a brief moment, that made me really jealous and uncomfortable. Yes, my partner has very close girl friends, but idk if it's a me problem but that shit crossed the boundary of being a girl friend. 

6. My partner is always up for picking her up even though it's far and has a lot of standstill traffic. When my partner really hates standstill traffic. I feel jealous of this, because whenever he does it for me he always moans but when it comes to her I don't hear any complains. 

7. My partner and I went out for a party when I came back from a work trip that lasted for over 2 months, she then had a go at him for not inviting her and for not spending time with her anymore that he changed because I was back in the country. This instance also threw my partner off. 

8. One night whilst I was in a work trip, she gave my partner a leg massage while she was still staying in the apartment. And they were hanging out with my partner's colleagues and another friend. When my partner told me this, I felt really uneasy. 

9. He can easily share the IG stories of her that he is tagged. Like whenever they're in a car together, doing some activities, a selfie of both them. Which made me jealous, because he does not do that to me so often. That my stories are too gay or cheesy. He does share some stories of me, mostly annoying me but that how he shows love. He did post and repost some of the less cheesy stuff at times. I have told him multiple times, both jokingly and seriously that I hope he reposts my stories too as much as he does with hers. Kudos to him, all his 4 IG posts have me in it. 

I know some of these statements are petty and irrational, but can you blame me? Idk if it's the low self-esteem and insecurities I have that I felt this way. 

So, my partner added him to our Apple Family and let he use his Amazon account (which I also use) a year ago. When I saw the notification, I jokingly asked him why did he do that and his response was along the lines of  ""She does not have enough storage on her phoneIs there a problem? I pay for it anyway."" So I let it go. 

But since they had a falling out, that took out a huge weight in my head and my heart. Finally the jealousy and uncomfortableness subsided. 

Although she was still using the Amazon account and Apple Family, which trigger my feelings whenever I see her name on my phone setting or her orders and details on the Amazon account. There is always a tinge of uneasiness. 

Just this week, I saw her message pop into my partner's notification and oh boy my heart sank and I couldn't breathe that I froze. I told him that, and he said he won't message her anymore. And then low and behold, the other night I saw another message from her pop up again. Same feeling of my heart sank, my body froze, and all the feelings of jealousy and uncomfortable came rushing back down. This sparked an argument between my partner and I, and that's when I made him choose. He said he does not like it that way. Because how it will be uncomfortable for him to tell her that I (a former friend of hers) am uncomfortable to have her share those things when it does not affect us anyway. Like we don't use 50% of the Apple Family account and she pays for her own amazon orders. I know my partner does not like choosing between friends or me, but this is the first time I did asked him because I just couldn't mentally, emotionally and physically take it anymore. 

  
So, AITA to ask him to remove her? AITA for being petty and irrational? AITA to feel jealousa and uncomfortable to a friend that I used to have a close bond with?

4. One time we went to a club, I got into an argument with a waitress because the way she handled us. My partner got embarrassed of my attitude, and he walked out with her leaving me inside the club with our other friends. I felt hurt when I saw him walking with her in the hallway being so close. 

5. Same night we went out, she was sitting behind the driver's seat and she started playing with my partner's ear and hair from behind for a brief moment, that made me really jealous and uncomfortable. Yes, my partner has very close girl friends, but idk if it's a me problem but that shit crossed the boundary of being a girl friend. 

6. My partner is always up for picking her up even though it's far and has a lot of standstill traffic. When my partner really hates standstill traffic. I feel jealous of this, because whenever he does it for me he always moans but when it comes to her I don't hear any complains. 

7. My partner and I went out for a party when I came back from a work trip that lasted for over 2 months, she then had a go at him for not inviting her and for not spending time with her anymore that he changed because I was back in the country. This instance also threw my partner off. 

8. One night whilst I was in a work trip, she gave my partner a leg massage while she was still staying in the apartment. And they were hanging out with my partner's colleagues and another friend. When my partner told me this, I felt really uneasy. 

9. He can easily share the IG stories of her that he is tagged. Like whenever they're in a car together, doing some activities, a selfie of both them. Which made me jealous, because he does not do that to me so often. That my stories are too gay or cheesy. He does share some stories of me, mostly annoying me but that how he shows love. He did post and repost some of the less cheesy stuff at times. I have told him multiple times, both jokingly and seriously that I hope he reposts my stories too as much as he does with hers. Kudos to him, all his 4 IG posts have me in it. 

I know some of these statements are petty and irrational, but can you blame me? Idk if it's the low self-esteem and insecurities I have that I felt this way. 

So, my partner added him to our Apple Family and let he use his Amazon account (which I also use) a year ago. When I saw the notification, I jokingly asked him why did he do that and his response was along the lines of  ""She does not have enough storage on her phoneIs there a problem? I pay for it anyway."" So I let it go. 

But since they had a falling out, that took out a huge weight in my head and my heart. Finally the jealousy and uncomfortableness subsided. 

Although she was still using the Amazon account and Apple Family, which trigger my feelings whenever I see her name on my phone setting or her orders and details on the Amazon account. There is always a tinge of uneasiness. 

Just this week, I saw her message pop into my partner's notification and oh boy my heart sank and I couldn't breathe that I froze. I told him that, and he said he won't message her anymore. And then low and behold, the other night I saw another message from her pop up again. Same feeling of my heart sank, my body froze, and all the feelings of jealousy and uncomfortable came rushing back down. This sparked an argument between my partner and I, and that's when I made him choose. He said he does not like it that way. Because how it will be uncomfortable for him to tell her that I (a former friend of hers) am uncomfortable to have her share those things when it does not affect us anyway. Like we don't use 50% of the Apple Family account and she pays for her own amazon orders. I know my partner does not like choosing between friends or me, but this is the first time I did asked him because I just couldn't mentally, emotionally and physically take it anymore. 

  
So, AITA to ask him to remove her? AITA for being petty and irrational? AITA to feel jealousa and uncomfortable to a friend that I used to have a close bond with? ",,0.9974278807640076,1,0
126,1depd46,AITA for going to prom ,"Hi I F17 have been dating my bf M18 for 3½ years . We met online and were doing long distance until my dad got a job opportunity that moved us a couple of states away (My dad is American and my mum is British). Well I ended up missing prom in the UK due to the move and my boyfriend surprised me by asking me to his prom. 

I said yes and found the most stunning dress. It was an emerald green dress with a slit down the middle (important info). 

My mum & I ended up staying in a hotel 15 minutes away from my bf's house. My mum did my hair and makeup while my sister did my nails. When my boyfriend picked me up we went for chick-fil-a. When we pulled up to the Prom venue a couple of girls started to make snarky comments about me and my dress. Saying I used my ""daddy's money"" 

Most of the night they kept making comments about my body, face and my fake jewellery. Well my boyfriend and I were voted Prom King & Queen and those girls weren't happy. They ended up going too far when they threw dr pepper and sprite on me. I snapped saying they've ruined a dress that costed me $250 and they better pay me back every cent, I then told them the ring that was ""fake"" was my grandma's who passed away a few months ago. 

There faces went pale when I mentioned the cost of the dress and they looked sick when I mentioned my dead grandma. I told them I want the $250 in the next week and an apology. 

Once me and my bf left the Prom I got messaged from people saying that the girls were sorry but I was a 8itch for coming because I'm not from here so I shouldn't of even came. I got upset and went home a day early thinking I was in the wrong. It's been a few weeks and I still get messages. So AITA.

We both go to college and are currently having finals week. She just had her last exam and was having 2 friends of her over to play some board games. She asked me to come over and meet her friends for the first time, I agreed but I would only stay 30 min because I still had to study for a big exam the day after. Now honestly I was just way too stressed out for the exam and really wasn't in the mood but I didn't want to dissappoint her because I know she really wanted me to meet her friends so badly. Mind you i'm also autistic so meeting new people isn't always easy for me and definitely not when i'm already really anxious about my exam. When i arrive at her dorm I see there are 2 more girls and it turned rather into a girl's night with plans to go clubbing. I was a bit overwhelmed by the extra people and the noise of them talking loudly, I also had the feeling most of her friends were really not interested in getting to know me even though i tried to socialize with them. They just randomly started telling each other I looked like some guy they know from class. Then suddenly they began talking about their h0e stories and I heard some things that my girl did that upset me a bit. And at that point everything in my head builded up, the new people, the noise, the h0e story about my girl, me not feeling welcomed by her friends. So i just decided to leave only after 10 minutes of being there and just told everyone I couldn't stay longer because I needed to do some revision for my exam. My girl walked me out to the door and she knew something was up but I refused to talk to her and went home without saying much and no kiss goodbye. She was really upset for this, she thought it was really childish of me to walk off out of the blue without explanation to her and said i embarrassed her in front of her friends by leaving so quick.
