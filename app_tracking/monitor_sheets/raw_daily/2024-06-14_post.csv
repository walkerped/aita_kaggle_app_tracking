0,1dfhng8,AITA for ignoring a girl in my class that constantly brings attention to me for no reason,"Some context I’m a teen in high school, I don’t socialize much with people I’m not friends with and have some sensory issues so I’m in small private school for a quieter environment and am currently in summer school. Even with my limited socialization most people know me as one of the kindest kids in school.

There’s a girl that I never really liked because she repeatedly and purposefully says my name incorrectly and tries to have people say my deadname, she over heard me say it to a close friend when I was explaining why some people call me a different name.

Mispronouncing my name usually doesn’t effect me much(it is still seen as very rude and disrespectful in my culture and it reminds me of some less than positive memories) as it can be harder for some people to say but even people with accents or that speak different languages can say it correctly most of the time.

My issues started when she started saying other names instead of my actual/preferred name.  I have some hearing sensitivity and often hear my name when it isn’t actually said so I don’t tend to react to it when mispronounced.

Once she noticed I didn’t respond to the incorrect name she started to just shout the incorrect name at me until I would respond. She once said my “name” so many times the teacher told her to stop bothering me in class.

This has been going on for weeks and I have, in the past, directly told her why it’s rude and offensive to me. 

At this point I only give her one word responses and try to avoid her as much as I can, this behavior has done the opposite of have her leave me alone.  She is constantly trying to make me talk to her, she also openly insults me while sitting behind me in class, to the point that other students tell her to leave me alone.

Today, she was trying to gossip with my best friend saying I was rude and very disrespectful for not reacting to her when calling my “name”. 

My friend defended me and said how I have my reasons to ignore her. That made her ask me directly why I “hate her for no reason” and how she “has only ever been kind and respectful to me”.

I reacted kinda immaturely by just saying “oh sorry for how I act when you don’t even give me the same respect as a dog” she looked at me shocked than I just walked away.

I know I should have acted better but she didn’t try to talk to me again after that. My friend said I was in the right for what I said but I feel a bit bad about it.

I spoke about this with my therapist. She said I had the right to say how I felt but should talk to someone that could directly help with this weird half bullying situation I’m in.

1,1dffpyh,WIBTA if I asked my sister if I can test textures for my bridemaid dress?,"Hi, 

I am needing to know something. My sister is getting married in December this year. She’s going for a very basic boho theme. Next month, we’re going to our dress fittings.

Problem is that I’m autistic and I have a problem with textures on clothes. I get hyper sensitivity so easily and I’m afraid I’m going to embarrass myself at this wedding. My sister doesn’t really understand my condition and has always tried to push me out of my comfort zone and into hers.

I wanna make my sister feel proud and supported. So I asked her if I can order swatches for the dresses for me to test out and find out what I like. But she has this absolute vision of her wedding that no one can really change its aesthetic. So, I asked if I can try different textured dresses to see what I like. She told me she would handle it and that it’s not an issue.

Would I be the asshole for testing textures to find a dress that won’t mess with my sensory for her wedding? And if so, what can I do to change and help my sister?

Edit: so I talked to my sister. Turns out, I’m not planning or picking anything. That I’m just in charge of the kids and walking down the aisle with her brother…yay, I guess.

7,1dfe206,AITA for wanting my best friend to break up with her boyfriend?,"I (28F) have a best friend, let's call her Tandy (30F), who recently started a relationship with someone who is already in a relationship.

I generally try to be supportive, I try to create a space in our friendship that is non-judgmental,  but this is rubbing me the wrong way. Tandy told me a few nights ago that she wants to break up with her new boyfriend, let's say Daniel, because she feels he isn't making enough time for her. She has consistently complained that he is always busy, that he never seems to prioritize her, that he always seems distracted and I've been doing what any sane friend would do and telling her to address these issues or walk away because they may just be incompatible.

What Tandy failed to mention however is that, outside of his work commitments, Daniel has a whole other relationship that he needs to tend to. One that he has been in for YEARS. When I found this out I immediately advised her to drop out of the relationship because it already didn't seem like it was working and she was now one part of a cheating duo to boot.

What shocked me the most was the fact that Tandy knew he was already in a relationship when she started going out with him. This, specifically, was upsetting because she broke it off with her last guy because he started cheating on her and here she is now doing the same.

I'm still trying to be non-judgmental and a safe space for her but I don't know how supportive I can be when I feel like I don't even know her anymore. Tandy's already expressed that she wants out of the relationship but is finding it hard to leave him and I must be heartless or something but I cannot, for the life of me, understand that logic. There's a part of me that wants to ask her if this is her cry for help as her last relationship seemed really serious and she was torn about the ex, Tristan, for a long time.

Tandy's been watching tik tok videos that affirm that people's relationships are not the AP's responsibility and that women in relationships cannot be mad at their partner's AP if their relationships fall apart, which I'm finding ironic because she's been bad-mouthing Tristan's new girl on top of everything else.

I'm wondering if maybe I'm being biased here and seeing things through my own distorted lens because I come from a household that was broken up by cheating or if this is a valid concern? I'm actually questioning our whole relationship at this point.

8,1dfdq6t,AITA for spending my moms money and not buying my brother food?,"Me an my family are going on a trip so my mom spent a lot of money on me like 3,000+. I’m usually very wary of spending money and I never use either of my parents money a lot. It’s important for my to inform you guys that my parents are divorced. 

So, I was packing for the trip when my mom props up the idea that we should get dinner. My mom and brother was downstairs discussing so I didn’t really hear what they said. I told them that I’d order food using my dads card for myself. I only did this because I thought I heard them say that they had food already.

I ordered my food and when I went downstairs my mom started yelling at my for not ordering for my brother and that I was selfish for doing so. I only did order because I wasn’t aware that he didn’t have anything to eat. Then she yelled at me again because she said that I used her money to buy the food. I wasn’t aware that I was able to use her card at all. I thought that I was using my dads card. I felt terrible so I gave her my own money, about 20 bucks which was 5 more than the actual order. She was mad and I kept apologizing. I will be honest and say that my tone wasn’t the best as I was annoyed and upset about how she was painting me to be this terrible person. But her tone towards me was even worse. 

I kept trying to explain to her how this whole thing is an accident but it felt like that went over her head. She kept saying how she doesn’t want to use anymore money on her card which I understand as I offered to pay her back. But she then said that I was twisting her words. She went off to say that I was selfish for not ordering for my brother and that I never pay her money back. She gave the example of how my step dad didn’t want to pay for our dogs groom because I never pay them back. I would have done so if they just asked me in person at home. I would have given them the money. 

Mind you I don’t have a job because I don’t have a car. I don’t get allowance either, I only use money from my dads card and money from new years. I try not to use money from my dads card too much because he had 3 other children 1 which is a new born and I don’t want to burden him too much. He’s already paying for my college tuition and it makes me feel bad that he keeps paying for these small things. But my mom kept saying that she’s spent so much money on the tickets and that I always feel bad for my dad and not her. 

I ended up cry and telling her that this whole thing wasn’t my intention and that I feel like she’s making me seem like a bad person. Needless to say that did not end well and only got me a scolding in return. I left the 20 bucks in her room and sobbed in my bedroom.

I wasn’t aware that I was able to use her card at all. I thought that I was using my dads card. I felt terrible so I gave her my own money, about 20 bucks which was 5 more than the actual order. She was mad and I kept apologizing. I will be honest and say that my tone wasn’t the best as I was annoyed and upset about how she was painting me to be this terrible person. But her tone towards me was even worse. 

I kept trying to explain to her how this whole thing is an accident but it felt like that went over her head. She kept saying how she doesn’t want to use anymore money on her card which I understand as I offered to pay her back. But she then said that I was twisting her words. She went off to say that I was selfish for not ordering for my brother and that I never pay her money back. She gave the example of how my step dad didn’t want to pay for our dogs groom because I never pay them back. I would have done so if they just asked me in person at home. I would have given them the money. 

Mind you I don’t have a job because I don’t have a car. I don’t get allowance either, I only use money from my dads card and money from new years. I try not to use money from my dads card too much because he had 3 other children 1 which is a new born and I don’t want to burden him too much. He’s already paying for my college tuition and it makes me feel bad that he keeps paying for these small things. But my mom kept saying that she’s spent so much money on the tickets and that I always feel bad for my dad and not her. 

I ended up cry and telling her that this whole thing wasn’t my intention and that I feel like she’s making me seem like a bad person. Needless to say that did not end well and only got me a scolding in return. I left the 20 bucks in her room and sobbed in my bedroom.
