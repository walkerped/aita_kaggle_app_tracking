0,1dfhng8,AITA for ignoring a girl in my class that constantly brings attention to me for no reason,"Some context I’m a teen in high school, I don’t socialize much with people I’m not friends with and have some sensory issues so I’m in small private school for a quieter environment and am currently in summer school. Even with my limited socialization most people know me as one of the kindest kids in school.

There’s a girl that I never really liked because she repeatedly and purposefully says my name incorrectly and tries to have people say my deadname, she over heard me say it to a close friend when I was explaining why some people call me a different name.

Mispronouncing my name usually doesn’t effect me much(it is still seen as very rude and disrespectful in my culture and it reminds me of some less than positive memories) as it can be harder for some people to say but even people with accents or that speak different languages can say it correctly most of the time.

My issues started when she started saying other names instead of my actual/preferred name.  I have some hearing sensitivity and often hear my name when it isn’t actually said so I don’t tend to react to it when mispronounced.

Once she noticed I didn’t respond to the incorrect name she started to just shout the incorrect name at me until I would respond. She once said my “name” so many times the teacher told her to stop bothering me in class.

This has been going on for weeks and I have, in the past, directly told her why it’s rude and offensive to me. 

At this point I only give her one word responses and try to avoid her as much as I can, this behavior has done the opposite of have her leave me alone.  She is constantly trying to make me talk to her, she also openly insults me while sitting behind me in class, to the point that other students tell her to leave me alone.

Today, she was trying to gossip with my best friend saying I was rude and very disrespectful for not reacting to her when calling my “name”. 

My friend defended me and said how I have my reasons to ignore her. That made her ask me directly why I “hate her for no reason” and how she “has only ever been kind and respectful to me”.

I reacted kinda immaturely by just saying “oh sorry for how I act when you don’t even give me the same respect as a dog” she looked at me shocked than I just walked away.

I know I should have acted better but she didn’t try to talk to me again after that. My friend said I was in the right for what I said but I feel a bit bad about it.

I spoke about this with my therapist. She said I had the right to say how I felt but should talk to someone that could directly help with this weird half bullying situation I’m in.

1,1dffpyh,WIBTA if I asked my sister if I can test textures for my bridemaid dress?,"Hi, 

I am needing to know something. My sister is getting married in December this year. She’s going for a very basic boho theme. Next month, we’re going to our dress fittings.

Problem is that I’m autistic and I have a problem with textures on clothes. I get hyper sensitivity so easily and I’m afraid I’m going to embarrass myself at this wedding. My sister doesn’t really understand my condition and has always tried to push me out of my comfort zone and into hers.

I wanna make my sister feel proud and supported. So I asked her if I can order swatches for the dresses for me to test out and find out what I like. But she has this absolute vision of her wedding that no one can really change its aesthetic. So, I asked if I can try different textured dresses to see what I like. She told me she would handle it and that it’s not an issue.

Would I be the asshole for testing textures to find a dress that won’t mess with my sensory for her wedding? And if so, what can I do to change and help my sister?

Edit: so I talked to my sister. Turns out, I’m not planning or picking anything. That I’m just in charge of the kids and walking down the aisle with her brother…yay, I guess.

7,1dfe206,AITA for wanting my best friend to break up with her boyfriend?,"I (28F) have a best friend, let's call her Tandy (30F), who recently started a relationship with someone who is already in a relationship.

I generally try to be supportive, I try to create a space in our friendship that is non-judgmental,  but this is rubbing me the wrong way. Tandy told me a few nights ago that she wants to break up with her new boyfriend, let's say Daniel, because she feels he isn't making enough time for her. She has consistently complained that he is always busy, that he never seems to prioritize her, that he always seems distracted and I've been doing what any sane friend would do and telling her to address these issues or walk away because they may just be incompatible.

What Tandy failed to mention however is that, outside of his work commitments, Daniel has a whole other relationship that he needs to tend to. One that he has been in for YEARS. When I found this out I immediately advised her to drop out of the relationship because it already didn't seem like it was working and she was now one part of a cheating duo to boot.

What shocked me the most was the fact that Tandy knew he was already in a relationship when she started going out with him. This, specifically, was upsetting because she broke it off with her last guy because he started cheating on her and here she is now doing the same.

I'm still trying to be non-judgmental and a safe space for her but I don't know how supportive I can be when I feel like I don't even know her anymore. Tandy's already expressed that she wants out of the relationship but is finding it hard to leave him and I must be heartless or something but I cannot, for the life of me, understand that logic. There's a part of me that wants to ask her if this is her cry for help as her last relationship seemed really serious and she was torn about the ex, Tristan, for a long time.

Tandy's been watching tik tok videos that affirm that people's relationships are not the AP's responsibility and that women in relationships cannot be mad at their partner's AP if their relationships fall apart, which I'm finding ironic because she's been bad-mouthing Tristan's new girl on top of everything else.

I'm wondering if maybe I'm being biased here and seeing things through my own distorted lens because I come from a household that was broken up by cheating or if this is a valid concern? I'm actually questioning our whole relationship at this point.

8,1dfdq6t,AITA for spending my moms money and not buying my brother food?,"Me an my family are going on a trip so my mom spent a lot of money on me like 3,000+. I’m usually very wary of spending money and I never use either of my parents money a lot. It’s important for my to inform you guys that my parents are divorced. 

So, I was packing for the trip when my mom props up the idea that we should get dinner. My mom and brother was downstairs discussing so I didn’t really hear what they said. I told them that I’d order food using my dads card for myself. I only did this because I thought I heard them say that they had food already.

I ordered my food and when I went downstairs my mom started yelling at my for not ordering for my brother and that I was selfish for doing so. I only did order because I wasn’t aware that he didn’t have anything to eat. Then she yelled at me again because she said that I used her money to buy the food. I wasn’t aware that I was able to use her card at all. I thought that I was using my dads card. I felt terrible so I gave her my own money, about 20 bucks which was 5 more than the actual order. She was mad and I kept apologizing. I will be honest and say that my tone wasn’t the best as I was annoyed and upset about how she was painting me to be this terrible person. But her tone towards me was even worse. 

I kept trying to explain to her how this whole thing is an accident but it felt like that went over her head. She kept saying how she doesn’t want to use anymore money on her card which I understand as I offered to pay her back. But she then said that I was twisting her words. She went off to say that I was selfish for not ordering for my brother and that I never pay her money back. She gave the example of how my step dad didn’t want to pay for our dogs groom because I never pay them back. I would have done so if they just asked me in person at home. I would have given them the money. 

Mind you I don’t have a job because I don’t have a car. I don’t get allowance either, I only use money from my dads card and money from new years. I try not to use money from my dads card too much because he had 3 other children 1 which is a new born and I don’t want to burden him too much. He’s already paying for my college tuition and it makes me feel bad that he keeps paying for these small things. But my mom kept saying that she’s spent so much money on the tickets and that I always feel bad for my dad and not her. 

I ended up cry and telling her that this whole thing wasn’t my intention and that I feel like she’s making me seem like a bad person. Needless to say that did not end well and only got me a scolding in return. I left the 20 bucks in her room and sobbed in my bedroom.

I wasn’t aware that I was able to use her card at all. I thought that I was using my dads card. I felt terrible so I gave her my own money, about 20 bucks which was 5 more than the actual order. She was mad and I kept apologizing. I will be honest and say that my tone wasn’t the best as I was annoyed and upset about how she was painting me to be this terrible person. But her tone towards me was even worse. 

I kept trying to explain to her how this whole thing is an accident but it felt like that went over her head. She kept saying how she doesn’t want to use anymore money on her card which I understand as I offered to pay her back. But she then said that I was twisting her words. She went off to say that I was selfish for not ordering for my brother and that I never pay her money back. She gave the example of how my step dad didn’t want to pay for our dogs groom because I never pay them back. I would have done so if they just asked me in person at home. I would have given them the money. 

Mind you I don’t have a job because I don’t have a car. I don’t get allowance either, I only use money from my dads card and money from new years. I try not to use money from my dads card too much because he had 3 other children 1 which is a new born and I don’t want to burden him too much. He’s already paying for my college tuition and it makes me feel bad that he keeps paying for these small things. But my mom kept saying that she’s spent so much money on the tickets and that I always feel bad for my dad and not her. 

I ended up cry and telling her that this whole thing wasn’t my intention and that I feel like she’s making me seem like a bad person. Needless to say that did not end well and only got me a scolding in return. I left the 20 bucks in her room and sobbed in my bedroom.

My (26F) sister (25F) long term boyfriend unexpectedly died last 2 months ago. 

My whole family has been very supportive of her and been trying hard to help her, she also has biweekly therapy too.

We are living together in an apartment with 2 bedroom. Since the death of his boyfriend, I have been quietly helping financially to his boyfriend hospital bill to other expenses needed until this day.

I found out this week that my bill for my cc for this month has been 5times my usually bill due to helping, I didnt stress it out that much but I have been thinking what to do about it silently.

I reach out to her if she can pay me the food we have ordered throughout the last month so I can use it to pay my cc. However, she made a lot of unnecessary comment when I sent her the breakdown of the food she ordered and ate, this was around 5% of the cc bill. 

she said something “where will I get the money to pay you” (she has work and part time and is making enough) “we shouldnt really doing debts because I dont like this” - I just said I agree

She also computed everything one by one making sure I got them correctly - I didnt include everything and made some of the item cheaper than it should - which she eventually found out since she tried to compute

when i said I also have to pay some cc bills she said its not a problem to you since you have a lot of money - I work 2 full time jobs, 1 part time, and other gigs just so I can somehow buy some things I want

I am working very hard for that money and making it sound so easy really triggered me that made me mad and say things like “I didnt get the appreciation after trying to be the nice guy - not asking you to pay for other stuff, not asking you to pay electricity bill, not asking you to pay other things we need in the apartment”

17,1dg3d74,AITA For the way i (19F) reacted to my brother (30M),"I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Every-time my family get together, Mainly when my brother (30M)  and Dad (60M) are in the same room. My brother ends up doing something that hurts my feelings or just being straight up disrespectful yet my Dad always tells me to ignore it and be more gentle towards him because he’s “sensitive” 

The recent one that made me snap back, my brother came over and i opened the door for him, he said out loud “EUGH YOUR HAIR” just because i let it be natural and curl, instead of straightening it, of course i got offended and upset because it was uncalled for. My Dad of course tells me to be mature and take a joke, basically to just let him treat me horribly again. 
I go into a quiet mood, then they both basically ignore my existence and act like im being dramatic. 

Me and my brother after 30 mins or so go out to go food shopping, he starts saying that he already said sorry and that i basically need to get over it, i try explain why it made me feel bad and he just argued back for ages. Which obviously makes it worse. As were walking down the street i tell him he sounds like our sister we dont have contact with anymore because she would gaslight in a similar way so he says “f**k off” and leaves me in the street alone. After an hour of staying out because i couldnt bare the thought of going back home knowing they’d both gang up on me. As i predicted i was right, they both completely ignored my existence and didnt speak to me. I hid in my room in the end. 

I eventually sent a message to my brother explaining how i felt and he said sorry but all he could say is he’s having a hard time and doesn’t know how to handle his emotions, its not fair because its always about him hes been treating me like this since i was like 10 and its always about his emotions yet they cant seem to fathom i have feelings too they tell me to be mature but im basically still a teenager while hes a full grown man. It bothers me that my dad will always jump to his defence even tho my dad is basically my best friend i know my dad loves me with all his heart and even heard him say im his favourite to his ex girlfriend. So thats why i dont understand why he defends my brother all the time.

For a bit of context i don’t have a Mum that can help me and my brother has been babied his whole life, he’s the only son and is basically a 30 year old jock who’s always drinking and acting like a teenage boy, losing his money to drinking constantly so my dad then has to fund his entire existence. Hes a spoiled 30 year old baby. If i did this to him i know i wouldnt hear the end of it.

My brother ends up doing something that hurts my feelings or just being straight up disrespectful yet my Dad always tells me to ignore it and be more gentle towards him because he’s “sensitive” 

The recent one that made me snap back, my brother came over and i opened the door for him, he said out loud “EUGH YOUR HAIR” just because i let it be natural and curl, instead of straightening it, of course i got offended and upset because it was uncalled for. My Dad of course tells me to be mature and take a joke, basically to just let him treat me horribly again. 
I go into a quiet mood, then they both basically ignore my existence and act like im being dramatic. 

Me and my brother after 30 mins or so go out to go food shopping, he starts saying that he already said sorry and that i basically need to get over it, i try explain why it made me feel bad and he just argued back for ages. Which obviously makes it worse. As were walking down the street i tell him he sounds like our sister we dont have contact with anymore because she would gaslight in a similar way so he says “f**k off” and leaves me in the street alone. After an hour of staying out because i couldnt bare the thought of going back home knowing they’d both gang up on me. As i predicted i was right, they both completely ignored my existence and didnt speak to me. I hid in my room in the end. 

I eventually sent a message to my brother explaining how i felt and he said sorry but all he could say is he’s having a hard time and doesn’t know how to handle his emotions, its not fair because its always about him hes been treating me like this since i was like 10 and its always about his emotions yet they cant seem to fathom i have feelings too they tell me to be mature but im basically still a teenager while hes a full grown man. It bothers me that my dad will always jump to his defence even tho my dad is basically my best friend i know my dad loves me with all his heart and even heard him say im his favourite to his ex girlfriend. So thats why i dont understand why he defends my brother all the time.

For a bit of context i don’t have a Mum that can help me and my brother has been babied his whole life, he’s the only son and is basically a 30 year old jock who’s always drinking and acting like a teenage boy, losing his money to drinking constantly so my dad then has to fund his entire existence. Hes a spoiled 30 year old baby. If i did this to him i know i wouldnt hear the end of it.

I just need advice i dont know how to handle it anymore am i being an asshole for reacting back? Should i be more considerate? I just cant tell if i really am being dramatic or if theyre the mean ones.",0.0,0.005500425584614277,0,1
18,1dg3cvz,AITA for not donating clothes to a struggling family,"
My mother and I have a complicated relationship - she would regularly tell me how she needed to have therapy in order to have children and that didn't do well did fostering a great dynamic between us. 

I am currently 7 months pregnant and it has not been easy, mentally or financially. My industry was in strike and I wasn't able to find work for nearly 6 months. I am luckily employed now but we are paying off debts and trying to prepare as best we can before the baby arrives. Naturally this has caused a whole lot of anxiety. 

My best friend has a 5 yr old boy and she generously gave us his entire wardrobe ages birth-6m with promise of bigger sizes when our child needs them. We accepted with huge gratitude and the promise to return them once we no longer needed them. It meant one thing we didn't need to worry about is clothes. Because of this, we have asked people to please not gift us any, and instead have provided a list of things we need and would prefer should anyone insist on giving us gifts (very much not expected though!!)

My mother, however, refuses to listen to this request. She has insisted on knitting a huge number of cardigans (our baby will be born in the summer..) and buying outfits that match them. When asked not to she has agreed, only to say she can't help herself. I have had to be very firm that we do not want any more clothes. 

This evening she asked me if she could have some of the clothes we have to donate to a refugee family that she knows with a baby, and I didn't know how to respond. It felt loaded to me, given that we have had to repeatedly ask her not to give us more clothes, as though we must have so many that they will just go to waste. I also have a nephew who is 6 months old, but she's not asked for his clothes. It feels as though she is challenging me to either donate what I have or admit that I don't have enough so she can be greenlit to keep buying us more. 

While I would love to help a struggling family if I could, it would feel like I was putting on someone else's oxygen mask before my own, but I can't tell if my anxiety at this request is reasonable or tainted by what feels like an uncomfortable guilt trip that my mother has designed. This is our first baby and I don't know if we will need everything my friend gave us.

Lucy met her ex when we were 16 - he was older. They married 3 years after. It was awful, only lasted a year and she was traumatized. Her parents were always very polite but cold, maybe that's why she fell in love so quickly. They gave her her college fund and moved to a warm country to retire. When the marriage ended she had nothing, it was hard, we helped her and she said she was never going to be deceived again. She threw herself to school and work in such a way that, other than the ocasional long weekend with us, she didn't even went on vacations. No bf either. In her early 30s she owned her house, her car, had savings and decided to be a mom. I was very proud. Lucy has 2 wonderful kids donor conceived. I am godmother to the oldest.

After cov!d the oldest struggled with socializing and one of his teachers, ""jake"" helped him and started to interact a lot with Lucy. Late last year they announced they were moving in together. We were happy for them.

Now, here is where us girls (me and our friends) started to worry. She always told the kids their dad is an amazing man that gave them as a gift to her. We are the only ones who know about her journey to be a mom. We were with Jake several times and some of his comments sounded odd to us.

20,1dg30ix,AITA for kicking out my BIL who's a single father going through a divorce ,"TLDR; brother in law stopped doing the stuff we agreed on and became a bad parent so we kicked him out. 

It's been a year since my BIL has moved in with his 3 year old. He moved from Cali to the Midwest escaping his abusive marriage. We've helped out alot, babysitting so he could find a job, giving him a place to stay, feeding him and his child, giving him money for a car ect. My wife and I have spent a portion of our savings to put him in a position to better his life. We expected this, so it wasn't a big deal. 

When he firsted moved in we set boundaries, which IMHO they were pretty lax. Don't bring people over unannounced, don't go to our side of the house because it's dangerous for the child(and i have privacy issues), and if you're not paying rent then you have to do the communal chores(ie. Dishes, keeping the living room clean, and helping with yard work; we didn't make him do our laundry or anything that was specific to us) he was cool with it.

It was nice for a few months, coming home to dinner and a clean house was super cool, he got a part time job, but eventually the chores stopped getting done and his BF started coming over unannounced, eating food, doing his laundry, hanging out even when he wasn't home and staying for weeks at a time. He would get on his phone and completely ignore his child, and do nothing. After a few months of this(and him losing his job) we decided to have a talk about it with him, which lead to us being verbally accosted, he called my wife narcissistic, and mocked her for standing her ground on the deal we all agreed to.

I was pissed, but I put on my big boy pants and tried to have an adult conversation, which turned into(I kid you not) a PowerPoint presentation from him, to us, about how we were miserable to be around and how we're bad roommates, how he was all alone in this with no support. I laughed, hard at this presentation and accusations. I couldn't help it, and told him he's got to go. 

I want to say, I love the kid, I don't want anything to happen to the kid, the kid is awesome, smart and pretty funny for being 3. I wish it would've worked out but I can't help someone who won't/can't help themself.

21,1dg309b,AITAH for forbidding my ex-BIL from seeing my kids?,"My sister, Marge, met her ex-husband, Shane, in 2010. Shane has always been a liar. He started the relationship by not telling my sister he had a 2 year old son and was living with his ex. When she found out, 6 months into their relationship, she broke up with him for a month. In that time, Shane started sleeping with a coworker and continued to do so when they got back together, breaking it off a few months later. Marge found out after he broke it off because the coworker found her and messaged her about it. Marge forgave Shane.
Fast forward, Shane's son was diagnosed with cancer. It was an awful 5 year battle that took his son's life in 2017. We were all affected, especially Marge who cared for her step son like he was her own. Marge became severely depressed. She was a different person and Shane refused to get her help. On July 1, 2023, Marge woke up to Shane moving out. She had no idea he was planning to leave.
After, Marge discovered he had canceled her credit cards, emptied the bank account and savings, canceled internet, and paid for 1 month of electricity and rent. Marge had been a housewife since her stepson was sick. Shane left her with nothing, knowing her mental health. Marge had my support and that of our 3 sisters and mother. We all helped out but I was the closest to her. I watch her fall apart and rebuild herself. She got a job, went to therapy and was doing better. She opened up to me about her relationship with Shane.
I found out Shane abused her repeatedly, mentally and physically. He encouraged her to fight with her everyone and told her to hurt herself when she said she wanted to. I was so enraged by the things she told me and happy that he was finally gone. During their divorce, Shane reached out to Marge and they decided to date. I told her it was a bad idea but she didn't listen. They've been dating for months now, and he's around every weekend. Marge has caught him in lies since they have been dating.  
My children were very close to him and when he left, my middle child took it so hard. After what he did and the things I learned about him, my husband and I decided we did not want him near our family. 

My mom and sisters say I'm overreacting..they think I need to ""get over it"". They believe that since Marge forgave him, we should respect her decision and allow him back into all our family functions. I can't do it. I told my mom that if he was around, my family would not be. I was basically told that was my choice but he's welcomed at my mom's  house. 
Today, Shane and Marge showed up while I was getting my daughter from my mom's house (my mom is our babysitter when needed). I was upset and asked that they tell me when he's going to he there so I can ensure we are not.

**TLDR:** My girlfriend (F44) wants to travel alone to Italy to meet a male friend, making me anxious and angry. AITA or should I draw the line? I’m M42

Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on a situation with my girlfriend and whether I'm in the wrong here or if I should draw a line.

I'm (M42) and my girlfriend (F44) have been together for 2.5 years. Recently, she mentioned that a male friend of hers, who lives in Thailand, is traveling to Italy and asked her to meet him there. She is considering traveling alone to Italy to catch up with him, and this is making me very mad and anxious.

Here are some important points:

- She has known this friend for over 10 years. She traveled with him and another girlfriend to Greece more than 10 years ago.
- She has described him as a ""player"" and has said she doesn’t approve of how he treats other women.
- My girlfriend often travels alone, but usually with girlfriends or by herself. When she visits her home country (USA), she sometimes meets up with other male friends and even some exes, which also concerns me.
- She believes women can be friends with men and sees this as a good opportunity to reconnect.
- I have communicated my feelings about this to her, and she responded by saying, ""this is who she is, someone that has male friends.""
- There have been some trust issues in our relationship, especially with an ex-boyfriend who contacts her every six months. This ex-boyfriend once accused her of giving him herpes, which changed our relationship dynamic significantly after just 3-4 months of dating.

I feel very uncomfortable with her going to Italy alone to meet this guy, given the history and my feelings of insecurity. Am I being unreasonable? Should I put my foot down on this matter, or am I overreacting?

**AITA for feeling this way, or should I draw the line on her meeting him in Italy?**

23,1dg2vcb,AITA for making my mom feel like she’s disrespected ,"ok so heres the situation that really made me send this post. literally 20 minutes ago i was taking a nap letting everyone know to not wake me up. but for background, these past 3 days ive had finals for school clearly studying and stressing every single day. i should add that my mom does not show any support in me in whatever i do. neither does my dad honestly. im an immigrant and i had to learn proper english on my own as a 7 yr old. i feel like they still hold a grudge on me for being a child that held tantrums but i cant really go back and change time. i come from an indian background so whatever i did to defend myself they would automatically tell me that i should not be talking and just finish school. whatever i do makes me feel really bad about myself anyway. but about finals, today was my last day of them and i would be done with junior year next week. 

i was taking a nap since it was a half day just happy that i have no more work to do for a while. slept at 2 and at 3:30 my mom comes in my room and just messes around in my room. told her to leave me alone because i knew things were gonna go south. then at 5:30 she comes in or should i say barges in quick and jumpscares me due to the doors sound. she then screams like literally for no reason telling me to wake up multiple times. i then ask her why she did that and how that was unnecessary. we got into an argument and proceeded to throw a large water bottle at my leg (not child abuse) i hope everyone understands my frustration. i should also add that i am an only child. she does this all the time and is this because shes lonely? i have to be honest with u and say that she grew up in indian standards and refuses to learn when i tell her that she cant be acting like this in america. and she threatened my dad and me multiple times that she wants to go back to india because she feels like shes being treated like a housemaid. which i have to add by saying some nights i purposely say im not hungry just so she doesnt have to cook because i know she hates it. my dad treats her like shit but way better than an average indian husband including my grandpa. in my opinion she likes seeking attention by always making me the bad guy even though im the one that always gets hurt. her family hurt me more and its coming to a point where i might cut off my mom and her family from my life.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for making my mom feel like she’s disrespected  ok so heres the situation that really made me send this post. literally 20 minutes ago i was taking a nap letting everyone know to not wake me up. but for background, these past 3 days ive had finals for school clearly studying and stressing every single day. i should add that my mom does not show any support in me in whatever i do. neither does my dad honestly. im an immigrant and i had to learn proper english on my own as a 7 yr old. i feel like they still hold a grudge on me for being a child that held tantrums but i cant really go back and change time. i come from an indian background so whatever i did to defend myself they would automatically tell me that i should not be talking and just finish school. whatever i do makes me feel really bad about myself anyway. but about finals, today was my last day of them and i would be done with junior year next week.

26,1dg2byb,AITA for exposing my brother to his girlfriend about how he treats us? ,"I'm (30F), he's (26M)

To the outside world, he's the perfect man—attractive, a hard working nurse, respectful, and caring. Everyone LOVES him. However, at home, he's a terror, everyone lives around him. He does whatever he wants, it's easier than standing up to him. We live with our parents and 2 siblings. Since he's gotten a girlfriend, he's never home, only coming here to shower and eat. When he IS here, he treats us like scum compared to him and his girlfriend's family.

1. He broke one of my mugs, part of a set I've had for years and can't replace. When I told him I was upset, he told me to ""shut the fuck up"" and walked away.

2. My mom told him, not to park in my dad's spot. He told her to ""shut the fuck up, don't talk to me,"" and walked away. It's a known rule, everyone else respects it.

06/11: Last week I texted his GF, asking if she wanted to get a pedicure. I like her and I'm close with my other SIL too. She agreed. The night before, I confirmed the time at 3. My brother called, wanting to change it for a last minute kayak trip. I asked why he planned that knowing our plans and that I was upset because he doesn't respect me or my time. He repeatedly called me a clown, pathetic, and a joke, gaslighting and insulting me because I ""overreacted"". He demanded I apologize, saying he’d finally respect me if I did. I refused and blocked his calls and texts. His GF still wanted to go, I agreed.

06/12: The next day, he caused $1,700 in damages to my parents' brand new 2024 car. He offered to pay 50% my mom insisted he pay all. He said he’d pay 75% max, she said pay it all or move out. He LITERALLY laughed in their faces and said ""you can't make me leave."" he actually counted on his fingers of what they are and aren't going to do. ""First of all, you're not going to threaten me. Second of all...etc."" finished it with. ""sue me for the money"" and left to his gf's house.

He planted some flowers a few months ago and they're finally blooming.

06/13: My 16 yo brother and I were fixing part of the house when I accidentally broke a flower stem. He called us retards and idiots because we can't be careful. Actually started taking a video calling me an idiot me for Snapchat. Inside, he berated our little brother. I told him to leave him alone it was my fault. He said ""shut the fuck up."" I started recording and asked him to repeat it for the camera, he did. I told him I was going to send it, he said ""I don't care, do it"". So I did.

This led to a full blown fight. He verbally abused our mom and dad, refusing to pay for the car. She kept telling him to get out of her room and he just kept screaming at her. He declared he was done with us and was cutting us off for good.

On one hand, I feel like TA because he cried, saying I tried ruining the one good relationship in his life. Can't believe his sister would do that. On the other hand, he's only upset because he got exposed for how he treats us. His ""only good relationship"" is built on a lie. AITA?

UPDATE: I showed my mom this post, she agrees yet is making excuses for his behavior. She refuses to even consider kicking him out, so I'm leaving. I've already applied to multiple apartments and I'm looking into long term Airbnbs until I get approved for one.

28,1dg1wbe,WIBTA for asking friends to chip in for airbnb for our recent trip?,"My 2 good friends, let’s say Sam and Kate, and I had recently done a trip in Italy. They met for the first time on this trip and wanted to do a girls trip in Italy for my birthday — it was such a kind gesture and we had already agreed we’d split things evenly. I never traveled with Sam before and normally travel with Kate which has always been fantastic. We normally are very budget friendly travelers and never really book things in advance— just happy to sight see and walk everywhere. Since it was Sam’s first time in Europe she wanted to make an itinerary and book places for dinner so we said sure she can choose. It was during the trip Kate and I realized Sam had booked all the fancy expensive place for lunch/dinner so there bill for 3 people after each meal was about 150-250+ total. Sam refused to do public transport and only wanted first class tickets booked, and to take ubers only which were about €30 every time. We each took turns covering the bills. The trip was initially supposed to be for 4 nights but Sam wanted more days as she was flying over from the States. She begged me to extend the trip but I had already said beforehand that I couldn’t afford more days and it would go way over my budget. She kept insisting saying she will cover the hotel and will book me in for a spa day with her. I felt bad and didn’t want her to come all the way and not do everything she wanted and gave in. We spent those two days going to her favorite luxury stores so she could do some shopping.  I was happy seeing her so happy but I feel like I was paying extra hundreds each day splitting lunch/dinners and then standing around. When we got to our next destination I had covered almost everything for her as I was showing her a place I considered my hometown. After the trip I’ve been stressed looking at my credit card statement feeling bothered I didn’t speak up or refuse sooner because I just wanted everyone to have a good time. By the end of this trip everyone had complained that they’re way overspent and so no one has brought up paying me back for the airbnbs I booked which were over 1k for 4 nights. i didn’t bring it before hand because i normally wait for the entire cost to come out (conversions etc) before giving a number.

31,1dg171x,AITA for refusing to go out with my boyfriend and his coworkers?,"when my boyfriend and I first started dating, I told him that my ex-boyfriend used to lie to me a lot and sneak out and go to the bar, cheat, and it caused a lot of problems, ultimately ending up with our relationship ending and me having a permanent phobia of dating somebody who goes out all the time.   


my now boyfriend was well aware of this and things were going fine and he was going out once or twice a week with his coworkers- no big deal. i’m aware it’s my insecurities and nobody else’s responsibility to manage them. however, he made a comment to me saying that his coworker was lying to his wife about going out. then the week after that, he told me HE lied about going to the bar every day that week (he told me he was home). there was literally no reason for it. i’m not sure if he was talking about himself when he brought up his coworker, or just decided to do the same thing. either way it was out of nowhere because i felt like i could trust him and he made me feel comfortable about him going out prior to that.  

now I have a lot of trouble believing just about anything he says. he told me he lied because he felt like he was trapped and couldn’t do what he wanted- mind you we don’t even live together. it’s not like he’s coming home to someone who’s angry with him or anything.

 now naturally i’m an over thinker. why would he lie about going to the bar if he knew i didn’t have an issue with it in the first place? is there a waitress, bartender, or someone he felt he needed to hide? i voiced this to him and he denied it. case closed, whatever. or so i thought?

he ended up telling all of this to his coworkers, who likely have voiced this to the bartender (they usually go there every night after work).
i’m now extremely uncomfortable obviously and feel like anything i tell him will end up being told to his coworkers, and now i’m sure everyone’s under the impression i’m some controlling miserable insecure twit.

my boyfriend is now pissed off with me because he wants me to go out with them all tonight and i have no intention to. i probably sound ridiculous, but i’d love to hear if i’m the jackass in this scenario or if i’m over reacting.

Anyway, early this year, the players decided to start playing more often, and now it has become every Saturday night….at our house. If you work a full time M-F 8a - 5p job, you can understand that Saturdays are the only day where you didn’t work earlier in the day before and you don’t work the next day. It’s the only full free day. And even if that weren’t the case, I’d still ask that every Saturday at my home wasn’t taken. I feel like when you have roommates, you need to be able to compromise, and what I’m asking for isn’t a big ask. 

I tried to compromise with my brother and the players by asking that they play only 3 Saturdays per month instead of all 4. My brother said no. I then asked if they could do 3 Saturdays and one weekday. My brother said no. I asked if they could do 3 Saturdays and one day at someone else’s house. My brother said no. It seems that my brother is the ultimate decision maker, even though sometimes the players can be somewhat open to compromise, they end up going with whatever my brother decides. 

And then, my brother began a second campaign at our home. So now, every Saturday AND one weekday, his friends are over at our house for dnd. Now, every once in a while they can’t play due to schedules or whatever. But, on average, they are playing 3-4 Saturdays per month, PLUS the second group playing one weekday most weeks. And sometimes when they do have to miss a week or two, they’ll end up making up for it by playing twice a week or playing a longer session. The players don’t seem to comprehend how often they’re at my house. 

Our dining room is the dnd room and the room next to that is the media room. Dnd can be loud, with the music and talking over each other, and shouting. My boyfriend and I don’t get much time to spend together during the week, as he works late hours and we’re both exhausted from our corporate Healthcare jobs, so we like having Saturdays to spend in the media room playing video games or watching a movie in the evenings. But also just not having guests over every weekend would be nice. We can’t afford to move out on our own for another year or so. So in the meantime, the rent here is cheap, but the living situation sucks. 

I think if you have roommates, there will always be a need for compromise. At the end of the day, I just want to be able to have a planned one weekend a month where there aren’t a bunch of guys hanging out in the house. Not just “oh they couldn’t play tonight” at the last minute. I want to know in advance that it’s a free calm night in my home to make my own plans with my boyfriend or my own friends. And I think asking my roommates that they only play dnd at our house 3 Saturdays per month is more than reasonable. Or, AITA?
",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for asking my roommates to not play dnd at our house so often? 
Update:  My brother and I talked in person after reading all of the comments. He agreed to speak to the dnd guys and see if they can all compromise on giving me one scheduled Saturday with no dnd in the house. I will put it on the calendar in our kitchen each month.

33,1dg0uvf,AITA for telling my friend we all hate her bf?,"Hi all, first post so sorry in advance if its hard to follow

I (31F) have a close friend (28F) who I’ll call Tina. She’s been dating her boyfriend (33M) who we’ll call Matt for 2 years. Matt is generally an asshole, flakey, and inconsiderate, for example not even getting Tina a present on her birthday because “she had enough shit”. Great guy, I know.

Last week, Tina announced at dinner their engagement. I was horrified, and talked to our other friends about it the next day. They all hated Matt, but loved Tina and didn’t want to hurt her, so they told me not to say anything.

I couldn’t do it. A couple of days ago, Tina and I had a planned lunch. My ability to stay quiet grew thinner and thinner until she started talking about the wedding, and I couldn’t take it anymore. This is where I might be the AH. I broke, telling her marrying Matt was a mistake. He didn’t care about her and didn’t deserve her. She blew up at me, telling my I ‘barely knew him’, that she was the love of his life and he of hers, and that I was a terrible friend. I tried to explain that I was only telling her to save her from this marriage, and not to hurt her.

She said that just because I was ‘jealous’, I shouldn’t ruin her special day, and I got mad. I told her it wasn’t just me, to find someone who actually likes him, that we all hate him, and stormed out.

She called our friend group and told them what I said.

34,1dg0kh8,AITA for refusing to be the Matron of Honor,"I (37f) and my twin sister have never been close. We have never really liked or disliked each other, even as children and then adoscents. We mostly just coexisted in the same house until I went to college. We share no friends, hobbies, or interests. We have the same DNA and birthday, which has meant absolutely nothing over the years. We never wore matching outfits or tried to dress opposite because we are identical as children. We don't hang out, even living in the same town. We don't call each other for help. Nothing.

She asked me recently to be her Matron of Honor. I politely told her no because I am already going to be a bridesmaid for my best friend. My friend and I have known each other since we were in elementary school. We were in the same clubs and on the same sports teams. We had regular sleep overs. Eventually we went to college in the same state so we could still hang out. We are each other's go to for advice, cheering up, encouragement. 

This wouldn't be an issue except both are marrying on Valentine's Day next year, as it's an anniversary for both of them, either their first date or when they officially became a couple. One is marrying in Hawaii and the other in our hometown in the Midwest. I just can't do both. Also, I introduced my friend and her fiance, who is also a good friend of mine. I've met my sister's fiance twice and we only spoke a handful of times casually. 

My sister is furious. She says my friend is stealing her Matron of Honor after she stole her Maid of Honor spot at my wedding. At that point she was yelling and calling my friend names and I flat out told her she wouldn't even have been on the list to be my Maid of Honor anyway because after we moved out, we spoke on major holidays or if someone died. Not because we were mad at each other. We just have nothing to say to each other. Even then, it's awkward. Honestly, I wouldn't even know how to be her Matron of Honor because I know very little about her beyond her job. We have no funny stories. I know nothing about them as couple. She would have to write her speech herself.

Now our mother, cousins, and other extended family are calling me and saying I'm not considerate of my family at all. My mother was crying and saying she just wanted to see her daughters together and take photos. My sister said the same and I really think our mother put her up to asking me because I can't imagine another reason why she would ask someone she only speaks to on Christmas and then it's small talk before we go talk to other people. I honestly thought she had the wrong number at first. My father said they didn't have a photo of us together alone since we were 10 years old, so it shouldn't matter now and that both she and my sister are being dramatic. Then everyone said we were both assholes. 

AITA?
Edit: I couldn't get this off my mind so I called my dad after posting this. I learned that he refused to pay for the wedding because my sister's fiance has cheated on her with two different women since they got engaged alone and she is hoping for me to pay for the wedding. That's why she waited so long to ask me. He just told her a couple weeks ago after finding out that he isn't paying. He thought I knew because he assumed she's already passed the fees on to me. Definitely won't be paying or her Matron of Honor without any guilt. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for refusing to be the Matron of Honor I (37f) and my twin sister have never been close.

36,1dg05lc,AITA For Excluding My SIL?,"I (35F) recently purposely excluded my SIL (40F) from a family vacation, and now she is kicking up such a fuss that I am wondering if I was a jerk.  

Background: My SIL has always been a difficult person to get along with.  While she is not outwardly rude or anything,  she has several personality traits mixed with enough questionable morals that she can be extremely grating.  The most relevant issue is that she is breath-takingly lazy.  On past trips together, she has happily sat and done nothing while everyone else cooks, cleans up after meals, and even watches everyone clean up the rental while we are all trying to leave.  She is like this in all aspects of life, even going so far as to use scooters in stores to avoid walking (she is not disabled).  The last time she was included on a big family trip, she treated us all like servants to the point my mother swore to never EVER go on another trip that includes her.

The second issue is that she shamelessly mooches off of her father (mother has passed away) for money.  She will do anything and everything to get her father to pay for her many vacations, up to and including stealing her other siblings' vacations that their father tries to gift them. For example, she will pretend she is helping to book the rental and purposefully pick a date her youngest brother can't make, then graciously go in his place. This has happened for about 4 years in a row.

Fast forward to the current problem: I have been planning a vacation to Virginia Beach for a year, and snagged a huge rental to accommodate my side of the family (we all go out there at least once a year.  Pooling money reduces the costs a lot).  My brother and his kids had to drop out due to last minute issues, and I figured that this would be the perfect opportunity to invite my husband's brother to join us since he has been jilted out of a family vacation for at least four years.  Knowing my mother refuses to vacation with SIL, and given that she has stolen his other trips, I purposefully did not invite SIL, pretending that there aren't enough beds.  There is a pull-out in the rental that we could offer,  but I feel like she is neither entitled to the trip, and frankly would ruin it.  Also, she would just milk her father for money to pay for her share, and he is a retired man on a limited income. 

Now SIL is posting on social media about how she is left out, and everyone is leaving her behind.  She is getting a lot of sympathetic reactions and support from friends and family to the point where I am starting to wonder if I am really the asshole here.  So I leave it to you to decide, AITA?

I bought food, and told them to pay me back (which some of them didn't.) but it was fine. All of our parents came with us to our photo spot to help take pictures, which turned out SUPER cute! After the night was over, we made a large group chat and exchanged the photos. They then took it to Instagram and made cute posts with cute captions. I did the same, but only posted mine to my story, which deleted after 24 hours. Then, in April (This is important), I posted a slideshow of photos with the caption ""Name a better group of friends."" One of the pictures included was one of the ones from homecoming. I was being heavily bullied at school, and I didn't know who my true friends were, so I made that post to represent the people who cared about me. Then, last night I received a text from one of the girls asking me to take the post down. She said it made them ""uncomfortable."" I was taken aback, and asked her why I needed to take it down. She said and I quote, *""You didn't have our consent to post the photo.""* ....I'm sorry?? I quickly showed the text to my parents, and went to her Instagram page.

40,1dfzdrx,WIBTA if I told my Parents I didn't want to do two wedding ceremonies?,"Hey there, I'm Luca, (26m) I have a fiancé Penny (25f) we've been dating for 5 years and recently got engage. We're planning to have the wedding in January next year! We decided to have the wedding here in Oklahoma, where we live.

My fiancée family has no issues coming up here for the wedding. They live mostly in Arkansas and some of them we're going to be assisting with travel

The issue is with my Family... there is a lot more history here that just can't fit into this post. But my Father (60m) used to be abusive for many years, he got much better but he is still manipulative at times.  I left home 4 years ago and now live 15 hours away from my parents. My Mom (60f) had a stroke 8 years ago and since then has gotten much better health wise. She still takes a couple meds but has reduce it to a few verses the ten she started on right after her stroke. She is disable still though, and uses a cane. They live in Colorado.

My Dad and Mom don't feel comfortable having my Mom fly out to our wedding. Because my Dad doesn't think my Mom can fly because she's disable. My mom is anxious about flying and doesn't want too. I understand that flying is scary, but I also was afraid to fly out to visit them the 4 times I've flown out the last 4 years too but I still did it to see them for 1-2 weeks at a time each. When I've flown they always help disabled people on the plan and they usually go onboard first. It's usually a 1-2 hour flight, very short easy flight from one small airport to another. Once in the airport, I've seen little buggies transport people around to their gate.

We've offered to pay for their flight and even get them first class. They could stay with us, and we would pick them up from the airport. They don't want to do that, My dad wants us to do a small ceremony with them before the official ceremony. He wants to plan it out, in the way he wants, and he wants to determine the outfits and the ritual and such to be more akin to his culture which is different than the more traditional wedding style we want to do... but it's not what we wanted to do.

I've been heartbroken over the fact that they won't be at my wedding for months since I found out, but I haven't told them because my Dad will certainly not take it well. 

**WIBTA if I told my Parents I didn't want to do two wedding ceremonies?** And I just wanted to do the Wedding me and my wife-to-be planned out? The offer to fly them out would still be on the table. And to assist with everything we can should they choose too, but they probably won't. My Dad will probably accuse me of abandoning my culture (only one of many that make up my DNA) because I don't want to do the Wedding the way he wants. He's done that in the past. Or maybe he'll tell me I'm being selfish and not considering the family...

41,1dfz2u1,AITA for making my boyfriend return money to me when he’s broke?,"My long term boyfriend (27m) and I (27f) have been living together for 5 years, since college. I have always been more financially comfortable, even in our school days, since my parents gave me more than enough and his parents didn’t. I understand that’s a privilege. 

He chose a niche major and he just got a new job that pays USD 55k annually. I’m making USD 90k annually. Right now he needs to pay USD 400 monthly for 3 months until he can get healthcare from his job. I cover utilities like wifi and power because he’s still finding job stability and I don’t mind. We waste a lot of money on takeout and weed and frankly I don’t think he can afford that lifestyle.

I want to note that aside from money problems, I really love my boyfriend. He is supportive and honest and loving and we’re the perfect fit. We’ve been together for 8 years and been through lots of ups and down together and he’s the person I want to be with for life.

Throughout the past 2 years, he has accumulated a debt of $10k+ to me from missed rent payments and me covering for his car insurance, weed picks (we both smoke), etc. A few months ago we had a big talk because I knew he owed me some money, but he only just told me he never paid me back for 4 whole months of rent, when I asked him how many months did he owe me. Big talk: me raging and him apologizing basically. He always says things like “I’m kinda low this month. Mind covering for me and I’ll pay you back?” But he neglected to tell me that he never paid me back.

After the talk, his solution was to pay me 10% of his income every month. With his current income, it’ll take 2-3 years before he can pay off his debt. I told him that he needs to cover my part of rent for the next 10 months instead. I vowed to myself at this point that I will respect myself and be much harder on him from now on.

June came along and he sent me $900 for rent ($1100 monthly per person) and asked if we can delay the plan by one month and he will pay the rest of his share ($200) when he gets paid the friday after. I said fine but he needs to pay 50% of my share, so he was supposed to pay me $750 on his payday. A week after payday I told him to pay up. He said he had car maintenance fees, etc. and he was really struggling and can’t pay me right now. He sounded really troubled. I got pissed and told him to pay me AT LEAST his share ($200). We got into a huge fight and he told me to be more understanding because he would have only a few bucks to survive on for the next week. I did not let it go until he paid me the $200.

AITA for forcing him to pay me back his share of rent when he may not have enough to survive? 

Some more facts:
- he had a debt of around 1-2k to me that I’ve forgiven in college because he was struggling financially. I made him promise to get better at money.
- he is not ready to get married because he wasn’t making/haven’t saved up enough. I think it’s noble of him but also I haven’t seen him make any long term goals to save up.",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-14,"AITA for making my boyfriend return money to me when he’s broke?

42,1dfyzrs,WIBTA if I reach out to service dog agency,"Edit: Ok, heard you loud and clear! I will stay out of it. Appreciate those of you who gave thoughtful responses. 

My sister just shared that her family has been approved for their disabled child to get a service dog through a training program. The agency covers the costs of the animal and training, but the family is expected to pay for the day to day costs - food, veterinary, grooming, etc. My sister's family is behind on every bill, only one parent works while the other one fritters away cash, and they routinely borrow money from their parents. They run their car by adding two dollars of gas here and there, they forgo their own prescriptions, and you can forget maintenance like furnace filters or oil changes. It's not that I don't want the child to have the dog, but I see no universe in which this dog's needs are met, and it's going to be the first one to suffer when money inevitably runs dry.

43,1dfyyik,AITA for throwing a coin in the 9/11 memorial?,"This is my first ever post, so apologies if it looks weird.

I am an upcoming Sophomore in high school and currently on a trip with my middle school I went to in 8th grade. The reason why I'm on this trip despite being in highschool is because us 8th graders were told that we would go after our Freshman year, if we were to go on this trip.

Now, our trip consists of going to Washington DC for 3 days and NYC for 2 days. As of writing this, we just visited the 9/11 memorial.

When we visited, I was paired up with a friend, who was very excited to visit the 9/11 memorial as it meant a lot to him. His mother was actually a combat camera, and was responsible for taking some of the photos of the 9/11 incident you see on Google, so this visit was very meaningful to him.

He gave me a coin to throw in the memorial so we could pay our respects, since that's usually how it works at most memorials. However, we learned that wasn't the case here.

One of the school staff pulled us aside and made us sit down on the side while everyone else got to explore the rest of the memorial. She never gave us any chance to explain ourselves, no chance to hear our side of the story, and if we had been made more aware of the rule, we absolutely wouldn't have thrown a coin in there. There were no signs that said we couldn't throw coins in, so we were unaware that it was disrespectful here.

We made sure to be as respectful as possible, being especially careful not to seem impolite, but she wouldn't care. She assumed that we had intentionally been disrespectful, which could never be more wrong.

I'm extremely disheartened that I not only never got to see the full memorial, but that I was so quick to be punished, without any care for how much this memorial meant to us. So I'd like to know if I'm in the wrong here.",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-14,"AITA for throwing a coin in the 9/11 memorial? This is my first ever post, so apologies if it looks weird.

One week from now, we will both travel together back from Spain to Ecuador to see our families and one of the key points of our return was to do it together so none of us would have to travel alone. We have to take two flights back, one longer one to Colombia first (around 10 hours) and a shorter one after to Ecuador (around 1:45 hours).

We will be flying back seating next to each other on the longer, ten hour flight, so no issue there. The problem is that due to some uncertainties when I was booking my ticket, I am able to sit on a “Premium” seat on the shorter flight, while she is not. 

My friend would like me to downgrade my seat to a regular one so I am able to seat next to her since she has a history of flight anxiety and would appreciate me supporting her through that specific flight, since she has flown it before and knows it can get a little bumpy. 

I’ve told her I’m not willing to downgrade my seat since I don’t usually get the chance to fly on premium seats and that we will already seat together for the longer flight.

He does have IBS and he blames his behavior on that. 
If I lock the door he will use a penny or a screwdriver to open it as it's one of the locks that you can open from the outside. We have small kids so we don't want them to accidentally lock themselves in the bathroom that's why the lock can be opened from the outside.
I can't take long showers or baths when he is at work as I need to be watching our children, so I have to wait till he's home.

Every time, no matter if he's already used the bathroom before I go in he comes in. He gets mad at me for locking the door as it takes him longer to get in. One time I pulled out the drawer under the sink to prevent the door from being opened more than an inch and he got really mad over that.

He says that because he has IBS that he can't help it and I'm being a jerk taking up time in the bathroom. I said he could use the other bathroom but he refuses and said I should just get over the smell or not take baths

My friendgroup and me, (youngest 25, oldest 33) started to plan our vacation back in january through Discord. We had some trouble with planning the date because of a different person that ended up not coming with us, but mostly it was fine and we planned it fairly quick. We were supposed to go with 7 people total and we continued the booking process. We all agreed that everybody that said yes before the definite booking date (the date where it its impossible to get money back after that) would have to pay for the vacation if they were coming or not. This was so we wouldn't end up with more costs if someone decided to drop out. As the booking day and paying day came, This person said he would not be able to pay until he had his salery. This raised concerns for the rest of the group, since this was not a high cost vacation (a little over 100 euros per person). We questioned if he would be able to pay for the other costs a vacation would bring with it and he said he could save enough money.

As we continued to plan we asked people to meet up a few times on discord. This one person we could not agree with most of the time, but we always came to a compromise. The last time we agreed to discuss stuff, he told us ""I'm fine with whatever you guys decide, but I can't stay on this call, you guys just decide"". So, that's what we did. We decided to splitt the costs of fuel and grocerys between all of us and we would use an app to split the costs. Once he saw this in our groupchat, 3 days before the vacation, he started arguing that he did not agree to this. Mind you, it was first send 4 weeks before that. He never said a word before. We asked this person to get on discord as to not have an argument in chat. He ignored that for the first 8 times, while the rest of the group, including me got more and more agitated.

Once he did come on discord the whole scene was very hostile and this person kept saying that we demanded to have insight into his finances and ""look into his wallet"". We were unsure if he was able to split in the costs due to his hostility and once the emotions got too high, people started yelling and texting me that if he was still going, they would drop out, we decided that we couldn't let him come on the trip.

52,1dfxtb4,AITA for not cleaning my house  for the buyers when I sold it?,"I am a first time home seller.  We closed last month and got a rent back for about 3 weeks. Prior to moving out, I asked our realtor if I needed to have the house cleaned.  Our realtor confirmed that no, we did not need to have the home cleaned, as our contract states the home was being sold “as is.”  She further stated that it was not an expectation that we would have it professionally cleaned prior to moving out. I also knew the buyers were planning to do some construction on the house prior to moving in, so I figured the house would get dirty from that and they’d clean it once construction was finished. The buyers did a walk through prior to closing with no comments, and we also accommodated their multiple requests to coordinate with their contractors so they could come by and take measurements.

Several days after we moved out, we heard from our realtor that the buyers want to withhold some of our rent back deposit for deep cleaning of the house, cleaning of the fireplace (it was not cleaned out prior to any open house/the house being sold), and “dead plants” in the backyard. The items they specifically listed as needing to be cleaned were not clean prior to closing (ie: fireplace, under the kitchen sink, or oven), and the plants they listed as being dead are either seasonal so turn brown in the summer (when we moved out)  and green in the spring (when they  bought the house) or were dead when they bought it (staging pictures show prove that.). They are upset that the yard looked lush and green in the spring when they bought it and looks like it hasn’t been watered in a while now. We live in a part of California that is hot and dry in the summer, and the plants we planted in the yard are native to the area to withstand the summers and droughts we often have, but they do naturally turn brown in the summer (ie: ca poppies).  

I understand that it would suck to move into a house you feel isn’t up to your standards of clean and having to clean up someone else’s mess (even if you unknowingly contractually agreed to.) I also understand that it can be surprising and upsetting to see what look like several dead plants in the backyard when you remember things being more green.

We all lived together (boyfriend excluded) when the boys were first born, and I was very close to them before they moved away. I didn't see them again until they were 13, when they spent a summer with me and my family. It took some adjustment, but soon it was like I had two new sons. When the summer ended, one returned to their mother, while the other, citing behavioral issues at home, stayed with me. He had some challenges but adjusted well and became a really great and kind kid (still is). After about a year, his mother wanted him back, but he strongly preferred to stay. I discussed it with my sister, but she was against the idea.

Five years later, the boys are now young men. Although I haven't seen them during this time, we easily reconnect when we meet. We joke, talk, and they share updates on their lives with me. During a recent conversation, they confided in me (asking me not to tell my sister) that they have jobs and their mother and her boyfriend convinced them to hand over their debit cards under the pretense of ""saving their money."" Both my sister and her boyfriend are unemployed and have been using the boys' income to support themselves, and spent every dime the boys have earned (~5k). The boys want to leave, and I advise them to wait until they finish high school.

That was the plan until a few days ago when one of the boys argued with my sister and threatened to cancel his card. To which she threatened to kick him out, and he called me, asking for help. I promised him a bus ticket to my state if she followed through on her threat. Last night, both boys called me and said they wanted to leave. True to my word, I bought them bus tickets.

He had some challenges but adjusted well and became a really great and kind kid (still is). After about a year, his mother wanted him back, but he strongly preferred to stay. I discussed it with my sister, but she was against the idea.

Five years later, the boys are now young men. Although I haven't seen them during this time, we easily reconnect when we meet. We joke, talk, and they share updates on their lives with me. During a recent conversation, they confided in me (asking me not to tell my sister) that they have jobs and their mother and her boyfriend convinced them to hand over their debit cards under the pretense of ""saving their money."" Both my sister and her boyfriend are unemployed and have been using the boys' income to support themselves, and spent every dime the boys have earned (~5k). The boys want to leave, and I advise them to wait until they finish high school.

That was the plan until a few days ago when one of the boys argued with my sister and threatened to cancel his card. To which she threatened to kick him out, and he called me, asking for help. I promised him a bus ticket to my state if she followed through on her threat. Last night, both boys called me and said they wanted to leave. True to my word, I bought them bus tickets.

My sister called me today, furious that I hadn't informed her about any of this. AITA?

56,1dfw6w3,AITA For not playing a game with my GF,"For context: My (28) girlfriend (26) has been begging me to play fortnite with her. I may have played with her a few times to make her happy but I told her I don’t really care about fortnite. Its a fun game sure it has its fun game modes. And I enjoyed it when I was younger but now I don’t really care for it. 

So today she asks if I would play with her and I tell her the same thing I usually tell her and say I’m not really that into it. This leads her to getting mad and in a hissyfit saying that because I’ve played with my friends ( I told her I played a prop hunt with one of my very good friends literally twice. Any other time he hits me up I’m usually like nah. Because again i dont like fortnite lol).  Her: you play with them and it makes me feel like you think I’m not interesting or fun to play with. “ I told her I played with them probably the same amount of times I’ve played with you. So I don’t understand how you’re telling me otherwise. “

I’ve asked her other times about other co op games to play together or other shooters that arent cartooney or literally just anything that isn’t fortnite. Recently I’ve gotten into FFXIV and I love it I like mmos I like rpg’s. I dont mind some couch co op games and a lot of the games I do play are single player. I’m willing to compromise on playing any other game that isn’t fortnite. 

But because she loves this game (she has adhd big adhd feelings fear of rejection trauma) she takes me not wanting to play it with her as me not caring about her feelings or her interests.  She has not ever made a compromise with me for a game that I found interesting or wanted to play. I played It Takes Two with her for a bit and it was fun ( a game she also picked and again I compromised) .  But that was about it. 

I’m just really tired of these arguments circulating around a kiddy game I outgrew and don’t really have an interest for. I’m not knocking it I’m not saying it isn’t a fun game in general, its just for ME PERSONALLY I dont want to play it. I dont want to buy skins I dont want to play different games modes. Controller vs my old pc key board mouse is completely different and I’m just not into it. 

She’s taking it really personal and I feel like we’re a little too old for these little tantrums because anytime I’ve suggested a game I want to play and she doesn’t want to, I don’t get butthurt I just go on about whatever I’m doing. But for her it’s the end of the world I dont want to spend time with her I dont care about the things she finds interesting etc. when its not even that its just idgaf about no fortnite 😭.  So please reddit am I tweaking?

this friend and i had a TERRIBLE falling out, causing me to move schools. they were manipulative and extremely jealous of my gf. i started trying to distance myself healthily and they blew it up to be something HUGE. i had communicated with them in the past about a few things that were uncomfortable and they didn’t listen to me and kept going. anytime i called them out, all of a sudden i was the one in the wrong apparently??? 

there was one fight we had where they literally SAID they were jealous, so i mentioned it and they tried to gaslight me into thinking they didn’t.

anyways, putting that aside, when we were friends, they made an instagram account using an email I OWN, to prevent their parents seeing the account. owning the email, i have the ability to reset the password, and i’ve been wanting to do it for a while. i’m tired of getting emails of a login from an unfamiliar device, it’s annoying and a constant reminder of them.

59,1dfvq0r,AITAH for going off on my sperm donor after contacting me 31 years later looking for sympathy ,"There's a lot to put here but I'm gonna explain things as best as I can. Me and my sperm donor have a very strained relationship. From the stories my mother told me, he used to do drugs a lot before and after I was born. She told me that while she was pregnant with me, he never once helped her do anything. He took her money, made her cook and clean and treated her like shit. He even allowed his friends and family to treat her like shit. After I was born, he got worse until he just took everything (his stuff and all of the money. He left my mom $38 to use to take care of me) and left. My mom told me that when he left, he looked at her and then me and said ""she'll be alright"" then ran off down the road like a fucking drifter. 

There were a few times he came into my life trying to be involved but they were all big let downs. Nothing to sing home about. So, fastforward to yesterday, I get a message from him on FB Messenger with him saying ""I love you"". I was confused and basically just asked really blunt questions of what he wanted. He told me he wanted a father-daughter relationship and that, ""when I'm ready. Let him know"" 

I will admit reddit, I saw red and the 31 years of built up anger, rage, and sadness exploded like a damn. I. Went. Off. I told him he was a terrible father and that he walks around caring about other people's kids and preaching about how God wants us to do this and that but he could never follow those teachings and do right by me. He ignored every single attempt I made to get him to recognize that he didn't do right by me. He flipped everything around to make it seem like he's the victim. He even had the nerve to shame my mother for choosing me instead of him! I was a newborn. I needed her but all he cares about is himself. I left him a long message pointing out his faults and how he needs to better himself then called it a night. 

About two days later, he messages me while I was playing Fallout 76 with my friends and tells me to ""grow up"" ""and that I don't know anything about him"" (yeah no shit. You left me dumbass) he then throws in a curve ball by telling me he has cancer and that if I don't want a relationship with him then it's basically my loss and he'll pray for me. 

Now, I will admit I may be an asshole on how I went off on him but I feel like my feelings are warranted. His side of the family doesn't care about me. His mother preaches God to me every time she calls me on my birthday and pressures me to have children because I have yet to give her grandbabies. I'm not against having children but I'm enjoying life before I focus on carrying for a little human. His sister used to make fun of me and call me a football player as a baby because I was a chubby baby. (Ironic since her daughters look like pit bulls) They don't even try to get to know me. The only time I matter is my birthday and that's if they care enough.

60,1dfvmxr,AITA for blowing up at my stepdad?,"I, (14m) have been getting increasingly angry with my stepdad (53m).Him and my mom were married for about 9 years, and as of recent his cheating was surfaced. They are trying to work things out and i’ve been as understanding as I can be. I leave them be when they need to talk, I watch my little sister, and I am trying to be nice to him despite the fact he walked out on my family. 

Their relationship has been on and off for months now. He’ll leave on his truck to see the other woman a couple hours away, leaving us high and dry until he needs my mom to manage his company. I’ve put up with it for my mother.

Now, here is where I couldn’t stand it anymore. My mom had to leave a couple states away because my older sister was having a baby. Instead of letting me stay with a friend (trust me, I begged) or letting me go to my grandmas she decided it was for the best I was left alone with him for a week. I was incredibly upset about this obviously. I was just trying to get through it. I woke up at 6 and went to school without any conflict everyday and then whenever I got home I would come home to find him absolutely wasted. My mom told me to tell my grandma if this happened but I didn’t feel comfortable being alone in the house with an angry man while waiting for her so I chose to keep the peace and keep my sister safe from him.

This repeated for a couple days, and whenever I wasn’t in my room he would nag me. He would ask me over and over again “why are you mad at me?” and “what did I do?” which was a topic I was trying to avoid. I would just tell him I wasn’t mad and that he was fine. On multiple occasions when I said this he went “I don’t even want to talk to you anyway; you’re so f**king negative all the time.” Finally after this happened for maybe 3 days he was driving me home from theatre, he continued with his questions and he yelled at me. I couldn’t stand it that he would yell at me. So I finally told him off. 

To summarize the argument I kept a very cool tone without any yelling, just being stern. I went “everyone has told you what’s wrong you just want me to feel better” and “you’re an alcoholic, you’re lazy, you’re cheating on my mom who is the nicest woman in the world, and you clearly just don’t care.” Then when he said he loved our family I said “you say that, but you don’t have any actions to back it up.” He went quiet. I felt bad for being so angry but he wouldn’t stop asking what he did, so I gave him my honest answer. 

When I told my mom she scolded me saying “You didn’t have the right to call him a piece of shit.” Saying I could have handled it better as if I had any other choices. They refuse to acknowledge that I am a teenager who can’t regulate my emotions and that I was totally in the right for being upset.

62,1dfvgzh,AITA for telling my mom her house is unwelcoming,"So, my mom is on her 6th marriage, to whom she has now been married to my step dad for around 5 years. Growing up she always had super strict rules to the point you got yelled at for shoes being left by the front door. At a pool party she went and bought big plastic runners to put down so not a drop of water got inside. At one point a living room that you weren’t allowed to sit on any of the furniture. At that point she was average middle class like I am today with 2 teenagers. 
Jump forward 20-30 years. Now I have 3 boys ages 8,12,16 and my mom and my step dad (who is very wealthy- I’ll get to the point of that in a second) and they live nearby. They bought a farm and built my step dad’s multimillion dollar dream home. They said their goal was to entertain and my moms one requirement was it was kid friendly for her grandkids. Well the craziness started before the house was even built. The kids would bring their 4 wheelers out and would be told they could only ride in the back of farm where you couldn’t see the tire marks from the road. They treat the 30 acres as a golf resort. They built a pond with a liner  for my boys to fish since that’s their biggest hobby. Well now no hooks can get close to the liner, No skipping rocks, kayaks can only be paddled in certain areas and so forth. 
Then the house… it’s beautiful, with game rooms, movie room and everything someone who wanted to entertain 100s of people would want. Yet they have a 15 guest rule. Family  are divided into days to come visit. Full of expensive furniture to the point for meals we end up eating outside or the game card table because to prevent stains. The couch has to be sat on properly, on the floors no shoes and only “clean” socks, no bare feet. They won’t let their dog come in this house as he sheds and so he has his own garage. Then the game room can’t be used unless they are there for fear of scratches or damage. The movie theater can’t be used because unless they are also in there. (I have good kids, who usually have to show them how to work all this stuff) 

It’s so frustrating and the kids get to the point they don’t want to visit due to all the rules. So my mom was upset saying she felt like my boys didn’t want to come stay there anymore. But anytime you go it’s so unwelcoming and stressful. She blames it on my step dad as he never had kids. But growing up she was hard to please as well. So I told her the reason the kids dont want to come is because they created this place that could be so fun, but they made it unwelcoming.

Then the game room can’t be used unless they are there for fear of scratches or damage. The movie theater can’t be used because unless they are also in there. (I have good kids, who usually have to show them how to work all this stuff) 

It’s so frustrating and the kids get to the point they don’t want to visit due to all the rules. So my mom was upset saying she felt like my boys didn’t want to come stay there anymore. But anytime you go it’s so unwelcoming and stressful. She blames it on my step dad as he never had kids. But growing up she was hard to please as well. So I told her the reason the kids dont want to come is because they created this place that could be so fun, but they made it unwelcoming.  Now she is upset at me and says if I can’t respect her rules than to not come over. ",0.0,0.05855809897184372,0,1
63,1dfvft9,AITA for choosing Great Clips over my neighbor’s salon,"Throwaway/Fake names.

I am 27m. My neighbor from down the street Jamie (36f) runs an independent hair salon she opened a few years ago. It was her lifelong dream and everyone who lives in my neighborhood has been supportive of her, including me for a while. I like Jamie well enough as a person but I’ve run into the following problems with her salon:

1. Walk-ins are nonexistent, and if you want an appointment at her salon, you have to schedule days in advance because she only has one other person working there.

2. The price is bonkers. I’ve paid as much as $45 for a trim.

3. This one is a little petty, but Jamie will talk customers’ ears off about dates she’s going on that haven’t worked out, gossip about neighbors, etc. 

A few months ago, I had a job interview and needed a trim ASAP. There’s a Great Clips up the road that was offering walk-ins, and I left with one of the best haircuts of my life for which I only paid $17. Since then, I have been a pretty loyal customer, and it’s always yielded great results.

Last weekend, I was at a cookout, and Jamie was there and noticed I had gotten a haircut. She asked where I had been, as she hadn’t seeing me come into the salon in a while, and I told her the truth, that I had gone to a different place but had walk-ins available since I needed a quick trim.

Jamie was really upset, saying that she felt betrayed, and that I ‘shouldn’t turn my back on supporting independent businesses for the sake of convenience.’ I later found out she hasn’t been doing as great of business as in the past.

I don’t think I did anything wrong, and while I do love and prefer to support independent business, something like a haircut is important enough that I would rather go to the place than be nice.

64,1dfva1z,AITA for trying to sleep?,"Hallo Redittors!

Have a question for yall:

My wife and I (both 43) are having a dispute.  I am the sole provider of the home. She is a stay at home wife/mom. We have an 11 yo boy who is mostly self sufficient.  Most nights after the boy is in bed, we load up the PS and jump on some CoD.  We play for a bit then I need to be in bed by 11ish as I get up at 6 am every day. She gets off the game with me, but lately has been wanting to jump back on around 130 as she enjoys playing.  Problem is... the TV is in our room, and while she is *mostly* quiet, I can hear her ""pssssh"" in disbelief, the creak of the chair, the game coming through the headset (not loudly... but in an otherwise silent area... it's def noticeable) and mostly, the flicker of the TV.  She gets mad because it wakes me up *every time* and I absolutely can not go back to sleep. I've tried. I don't give 2 fucks that she is playing the game.  I care that it interrupts my sleep. I get about 6 hours and that's it.  She says ""you're being dramatic.  I'm silent.  I'm not disturbing you"".  And I retort with ""well... I *am* awake am I not?"". 
She is a smoker, and I have a 3rd PS setup on the back porch with a smart tv... but it got broken about 3 weeks after i got it.  
Am I the asshole because I tell her she can't be playing that while I'm trying to sleep?  

She doesn't work, the household chores take maybe 8 hours out of the week, and she watches shows most of the day and could play then.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for trying to sleep? Hallo Redittors!

65,1dfv8kz,AITA for asking for money I was owed almost a year ago?,"
So to summarize my story one of my family members asked to borrow money from me, and I gave her money which was $150 about a week later she asked for $300, and then a month after that she asked for $400.
 
She promised to pay me back, and I realized she was struggling ATM because of her stupid financial decisions like tattoos, and paying for her friend's dinner which is like 7-10 people, so I gave her the option to pay back the whole $850 by simply buying me an item for $300 she agreed to it, but told me to wait. Then a month and a half went by and I asked again ""When are you gonna get the item"" She asked if I could wait and I simply replied back, just pay me in payment of $100 per week. 
So she paid me $100 for one week then ignored and blocked me for about a month then I managed to get her mom to tell her to contact me and she did. 
 Then she bitched about me being annoying wanting my money back, and saying I am super impatient, which I clearly am not. Also, during those times she still got tattoos and paid for her friend's events and stuff. 
Then she just said that she would rather have her mom pay the rest of the money to me than deal with me and told me to fuck myself and then blocked me for about a month, also her mom didn't pay me at all, then one of our good friends died and that when we saw each other at the funeral, I was little angry but quickly went away because I shouldn't get mad at personal things at my friends funeral. 
So a year passed by and I asked her mom if she had paid her back, and she refused to tell me if she did or not saying that I shouldn't worried about it, so I asked my family member who owed me money if she paid her mom anything, and she said go ask her mom then I replied she saying it non of my business. 
Then she said wtf am I digging up old shit and I said because I didn't get all my money back for a whole year, then she said that I'm the pathetic one for asking for money and try to say that I'm trying to get money from her mom and ATM her mom is going through some rough time like not having much spending money to spend on junk, but the bills are paid though. Then try to say that she hasn't asked for more money from people at all and told me to fuck myself, and said that the ordeal was settled a year ago, to which I replied it was settled at all you ran away and ignored me like a bitch. After that I said all I wanted to know was if you paid anything at all to get Mom, at this point I wanted the money to go to her mom cause her mom helped me, so I was hoping the money would go to her. Then told me fuck myself and said that I'm pathetic and that I'm asking for money and ignoring me and it happened 2 months ago now and still ignoring me.

I am a professional with experience through a larger company, and I typically charge around 20-30% less than the market rate for the kind of work I do through my business. 

My brother (32M) needed his gutters cleaned and a lot of moss removed from his roof. He tried doing it himself but his roof is so steep it requires rope work so he asked me to do it. I gave him a quote that he agreed to so I put him on my schedule (it was about 50% less than I would normally charge). I also let him know that when we remove moss we typically only scrub 85-90% off as to not damage the roof. Then we would put moss treatment when it gets rainy again. This is an industry standard. 

So I do the work and when he gets the invoice he is a little bitchy about it saying something along the lines of “c’mon, you’re really going to charge me for this?”. All after I just spent a couple hours busting my butt on his roof as there was a lot more moss than I remembered. 

Then a few hours later he messaged me that he is really unhappy with the work because I didn’t remove 100% of the moss. Again, I work to industry standards so as not to damage the roof. And I explained this to him. So then he says “damn I could have done this myself and saved a couple hundred bucks”. The past week or two have been very tense between us. Any time I ask for any sort of help he says something along the lines of “I’m going to have to charge you for that”.

67,1dfunfl,AITA for telling a friend that not being in office and only WFH was impacting her pay raise?,"I think I was too blunt and truthful. To be clear I understand some folks prefer hybrid, some fully WFH and some fully in office. It’s a preference and I myself prefer full WFH until last year after I got a promotion-responsibilities had change and twice a week in office made sense.

My friend and I work for the same company but different locations in the same city. Our positions used to be the same and we did the same work. Since early 2020 we were made fully WFH. Before the pandemic our work was about 40% offsite and in office. This type of work was phased out until early 2023. At the time we were first asked to do some local travel to vendors for outreach meetings. I was out of practice and hesitant but I was the first to start doing this (across all roles there is offsite travel as part of our job description). 

My friend was very very vocal that this was no longer a part of our job description and that she has a young family and she will not travel or go in office. To her point when they notified us of WFH the email stated moving forward all travel and in office work had ceased -we all interpreted this as that this was something no longer a part of our job. 

Last year, when some of us got raises we all thought it was project specific-new virtual outreach was doing well. However, we just got our new round of raises and almost all that received a raise either attended off site events or were in office about once a week. 

My friend flipped out -a lot about boomers, disrespect for moms and capitalism. Which she had a few fair points on but I did express that based on what’s been said at meetings we were expected to return back to our roles. I had noted that she was told last year to take back on her original duties and she refused and has been snarky to others who do go in. She was more upset than I thought she would be and called me an asshole and she was drowning in debt.

We walk our neighborhood daily—super family friendly, people are walking here all day every day. I bring a double stroller in case my son gets tired of biking. We are walking along a very quiet street when a white truck passes us and turns around to park facing us. I’m just minding my business. The guy (mid 30s, very clean cut, cartoony Avengers shirt on) stays in his truck. I notice. My son is whining asking me to help put his stuffed animal in the cup holder of his bike. I put the brake on the stroller and still have the strap around my wrist. I turn around and quickly stuff Fox in there. Took maybe 3 seconds. As I’m turning around and letting up the brake the guy is opening the door to call the eight feet away that I “shouldn’t park your stroller there. She is going to be coming home soon and I don’t want her to hit your baby.” I look and I’m at a part of the sidewalk that intersects passed a driveway. Pretty standard neighborhood stuff.  

There were no cars on the road. None audible anywhere near us. I was kind of caught off guard because the whole thing was so quick and it was preposterous to think I would’ve left my baby parked there to be hit by a car that wasn’t even there. It was also silly to think that someone was going to come speeding so fast down a residential loop and pull into their own driveway so fast they wouldn’t see a huge double stroller and a person standing there. And…it was barely three seconds. 

I replied: “I think we are all set” with a little smile. He grimaced at me and said: “well, I wouldn’t want something to happen or someone to get hurt.” I probably should’ve just pacified him with a “thank you” but I said “I’m a vigilant mother. Thank you.” He couldn’t leave it alone either and snarked back: “oh, I’m sure you are.” It was just so odd and got under my skin. It all seemed so passive aggressive and contrived from the start.

Of course my adorable child chimes in the he likes the guys shirt and asks him what is on it.  The guy ignores him, opens his car door, takes (or pretends to take) a call, and closes the door. The whole way down the street I looked to see if another car came quickly and no other cars came. 

Should I have just said “thanks” and just left the unnecessary comment alone? AITA? I feel a little creeped out by this person now. 

TL;DR: guy implied I was being unsafe by pausing my stroller in a driveway for three seconds when his parked car was the only one around.

70,1dfu1rp,AITA for not giving back my exes belongings because I had another appointment?,"My ex (m/22) broke up last Friday. We always had problems with time management because he had a lot of things to do. He is going to the gym, working, trading, and getting his driver's license, and he wants a second job. I understood that and gave him all my patience. At first, he was really cute, texted me a lot, and wanted to spend a lot of time with me. I planned my whole week just for him, and whenever he was free, I rushed to him. He said I needed to be patient, and after he got his driver's license, he would have all the time for me. After that, I gave him so much alone time and didn’t ask that we see each other, and so on. He didn’t text a lot, and I thought he wouldn’t send me texts from his own. So I tested it.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for not giving back my exes belongings because I had another appointment? My ex (m/22) broke up last Friday. We always had problems with time management because he had a lot of things to do. He is going to the gym, working, trading, and getting his driver's license, and he wants a second job. I understood that and gave him all my patience. At first, he was really cute, texted me a lot, and wanted to spend a lot of time with me. I planned my whole week just for him, and whenever he was free, I rushed to him. He said I needed to be patient, and after he got his driver's license, he would have all the time for me. After that, I gave him so much alone time and didn’t ask that we see each other, and so on. He didn’t text a lot, and I thought he wouldn’t send me texts from his own. So I tested it.

71,1dft1p3,AITA for blowing up at a friend over sensory issues,"I (m 14) have many issues with touching and sounds of things, some of the things I physically can't stand the touch of are; paper, chalk, silk, cardboard and polystyrene.

Friend A (infront) noticed I gagged when I touched my paper and asked what was wrong with me, I explained that I can't stand the sound or feel of paper but that I understand I can't not hear paper in a maths lesson so I deal with it but the touch was too much.

 After this friend B (next to me) started rubbing his paper and shoving it in my face, after I asked him to stop, not very nicely admittedly as I have had issues with boundaries with him before like him saying I was fat and making fun of my home life, friend A also started rubbing her paper. (I would like to add I am not autistic as I know many autistic people suffer with these issues and if 'sensory issues' is an autistic only term I'm sorry). 

But it all started getting too much for me and I ended up covering my ears as the classroom was getting too loud and I felt like I was focusing on everything and I was tearing up. After this friend B used a card to let him outside and I loudly stated ""thank God"" not realising he could hear me. He is now very angry at me and is very upset.

74,1dfs97b,AITA for getting my ex husbands car repossessed? ,"AITA for getting my ex husband’s car repossessed? 

Throwaway 

My ex husband is extremely upset with me for getting his car repossessed. We purchased the car in October 2018 in my name and him as the co-signer because he didn’t have credit. I paid the car note from October 2018 to some time in 2019. He took over the payments but some how he got it repossessed right before I gave birth at the end of 2019. I ended up paying for it to get out of repossession with part of a loan from my retirement account that was to last me through my maternity leave. I had to come back from maternity leave early too. 

2020 I moved away from him and I was still paying the car insurance on the car and he was making the car note payments. 2022 we decided to give it another go for our relationship. When he came back the car was in the rears. And mind you the entire time he was gone the car was never paid on time. (Fucking up my credit) So my actual car had gotten totaled and I was able to get a settlement. I paid for his car to become current and like 2 months in advance. We broke up again in 2022 and I stole his car from him because I didn’t want to go through the same thing twice. I purposely let it sit somewhere and didn’t pay on it and waited for repossession. 

Also not one time did he ever offer to pay half the insurance to me. We tried to get it in his name but they kept quoting him like $800 to $1000 for the monthly insurance payment. He kept on filing claims and I know some were fraudulent and my premiums kept on going up every 6 months. 

Fast forward a year after repossession the creditor took us to court. I filed bankruptcy because I refused to pay for it. (Bankruptcy best choice I ever made and credit is doing fantastic now) He chose not to file for bankruptcy and now they are garnishing his checks. 

He had ample time to prepare for this and didn’t. I offered to help him by going over his income and bills and coming up with a plan for them to take the maximum 25% of his checks. 

And this was his response below 

As much as it would be nice going over my bills with someone. I don’t want to with you. Especially with the garnishment. This car is slowly dying on me. Wasted so much money on my charger, you deliberately made them take it. My wages are about to be garnished while I’m barely making ends meet. Now you want to help me? Really? I’ll see you on Thursday to help you move. 

When he’s saying he wasted money he is referring to the payments and to fix it up and when he refers to this car is slowly dying on me he’s talking about his current car and he never showed on Thursday to help me move because he’s in his feelings 

Now Reddit am I the AH for getting my ex husbands car repossessed because he wouldn’t pay on time or help with the insurance?

75,1dfs00r,AITA for buying tickets to a sporting event before my partner had made up his mind about going?,"A couple nights ago, my fiance (26m) was rightfully annoyed at me because I stayed out at drinks with a friend about an hour later than I said I would be out. It was a genuine mistake, and I apologized and tried to move on with the evening, but he stayed pissed off at me. 

Later that night, I suggested that we get tickets to a soccer game this weekend.  I knew he would want to go to because the teams had an important rivalry and I found really good seats at a decent price given how late it was. When I showed him, he just said he wasn’t in the mood to make weekend plans. I’ll admit that I was disappointed, because I was trying to do something nice and I knew we’d have a good time at the game. 

I thought about it for a while, and then decided to buy the tickets anyways. They were selling out fast, and if we waited to get them we’d end up paying more for worse seats. Plus, I could always resell them on Ticketmaster if we didn’t end up going.

The next night, my fiance mentioned that he thought we should get the tickets after all. I was excited, and told him I’d already gotten them as a treat, because I knew he’d want to go. He got a little huffy and said that I’d overstepped (he’s not pissed off enough to not go to the game, though). The way I see it, I would have been wasting money (and possibly missing out on something we both wanted to do )by waiting for his bad mood to pass before buying something I knew we were going to buy either way. He said that’s not the point, and I should have waited on principle even if I knew he’d come around. AITA? 

Note: we’re not in a fight about this, it’s just a debate. My fiance does know I could have resold the tickets if he didn’t want to go, so it’s not about pressuring him into plans.

78,1dfqiyg,AITA for going on vacation without my girlfriend if she can't pay her way?,"Hi all, I (39M) am dating someone (33F) and have been for the last 3 months. Things are going well until the topic of my 40th birthday came up.

Next year I turn 40. And I've never taken an actual vacation. I've extended work trips to do something fun where I am. I've traveled to visit friends or family. Always just for a long weekend (never more than 3 days total). I want to take a week and travel purely for recreational purposes. My criteria is that the trip needs to be at least a week and be international.

I've also worked hard to get my finances in shape since my 20s. And now I have a decent business and some money set aside and I feel like I'm ready for a trip and next year woukd be a great opportunity as it is a milestone birthday.

My girlfriend is great. She works hard and supports herself. But she doesn't make as much money and, most importantly, is currently saddled with around $20k in credit card debt arising from a period of unexpected unemployment she had in the past that forced her to burn through savings and live on credit cards.

When the topic of this trio came up she first asked if she could go. I said sure. She then asked if we could go to Vegas. I told her about my desire for this to be an international trip. Then she expressed concern over if she could afford it while it debt. I told her I'd be willing to cover our lodging and, depending on where we go, help her pay for airfare. Because we haven't been dating long I don't feel comfortable paying her whole way and feel she should contribute financially to come along.

She then told me she didn't feel she could afford to cover meals + half airfare even if I went somewhere relatively cheap (I was thinking possibly carribean where trip flights are running typically under $500). So I said that I understood but I also have been wanting to do this milestone birthday thing for a while now and I still intend to go even if just by myself and would only be gone a week.

She became upset that I would travel without her and it caused a bit of a fight. My friends and family are split. On the one hand some point out how many things I wanted to do but didn't get to do because my ex refused to ""let"" me and so I should go forth with or without her. On the other, some are saying it is cruel of me to be planning a vacation in front of a person who is trying to pay off large amounts of debt anyway.

79,1dfqewv,AITA for comparing my parents to other parents like how they compare me to my peers?,"My parents are immigrants and always compare me to my friends, family, their friends' kids, and random successful kids they see online.

This all started because my dad saw me playing a game after I was done my homework and gave me a lecture on how I shouldn't be playing games but I should be studying.

He started complaining about my grades and truthfully I don't know what my parents are complaining about because I'm a straight A student. I literally got 100% in a class but they don't care because it's not math.

My parents act like I'm going to become homeless because I'm not getting 100% in every single class when I have above 90% in every class I take. He started comparing me to some student he read in the paper who actually did get 100% in every class and I got so frustrated.

I told them that compared to my friends' parents, they can't speak or read English so I have to do everything for them, including tagging along to every store to buy things for them. All my friends have parents to help them with school if they are stuck yet my parents never completed elementary school. Because of their ignorance, they refused to take me to a dentist until a few months ago because I was in so much pain. Then they even *argued* with the dentist on treatment.

I told them how hard it is to be their translator because they always interrupt the other person while speaking to talk to me while I'm trying to listen and then translate. How every representative blows up at me because of their behavior and tells me to shut my parents up. None of my friends have to deal with that.

I feel like they dumped the responsibility on me to kind of raise myself. I had to figure everything on my own and teach my parents that I needed glasses, needed regular dental care, developed good study habits on my own, and arrive to school on time because they always made me late and my teachers blamed me.

I ended up telling my parents that they don't get to lecture me on my grades because they dropped out and know nothing about the school system.

My mom told me that I was too harsh and said I needed to apologize to my dad because he was really hurt by what I said but I feel like I told the truth. I know that other kids would never say that to their own parents but they always compare me to my peers to point out all my flaws (like my height and acne lol) when I honestly believe that they're lucky to have me.

 This monday, my friend (who we will call Jane) said something about wanting a sugar daddy and wanting my dad as her sugar daddy. I said my dad wasn't available since he is already seeing someone and he is way too old for her. She says something pretty NSFW so I won't be saying it here, but it was fairly graphic. I didn't hear it at first and she was reluctant to tell me, but her friends quickly told me and I was shocked. I told her it wasn't funny and she started to apologize, but not a real apology.

She started apologizing again after classes but I told her to leave me alone. The next day, at lunch, she comes yet again to see me and starts apologizing. I, again, tell her to leave me alone as I didn't want to speak to her. She tells me to get over it since it had been a day, which is when I got mad.

NOW she's in a new relationship, I'm 18 now and I don't mind the guy, they've been together for 4 months. Now here's what I'm struggling to deal with, he has 3 of his own kids, 11, 15, and 17. I'm one of 4 now, 2, 11, and 14.

Now here's where I might be the AH. I hate his kids. I now live with my bfs family but l'm still around at home, but my mums bf (let's call him Greg ig) kids are around a shit ton. I only officially met them because I was forced to when my mum bought us all tickets for the Easter show. But now they're constantly over.
From my perspective, they're bratty.

I grew up where we were JUST getting by. I see myself now as very careful with money and extremely appreciative. His kids expect from Greg like no tomorrow and yell at him for little to no reason (my dad would've absolutely clobbered me if I yelled at him for the reasons they did). And they don't care about money he spends, and wastes it. (E.g we all went to a festival $60 a ticket and his eldest slept majority of it). I find it extremely disrespectful, I hinted that and got filthy looks but no come back.

They treat my mums house like their own. Greg's middle kid constantly picks on my mum, calls it banter, and my mum has a go at me for having a go at him. Greg's youngest, she's not that bad, but is constantly shitting on and trying to tease my bird (making my bird aggressive, if you own a bird, you know) just so she can say she hates my bird. Greg's oldest has brought her boyfriend over to MY HOME without even asking my mum, uses my mum to make her own mother jealous, and expects money and
'gifts' from my mum too even though we're still not that well off.

I will take accountability that I can be and look like a bitch. I completely ignore them until they do something to my mum or siblings, I yell at them and tell them to back off, but I always end up being in trouble for not showing respect.

85,1dfp701,AITA for refusing to move my wedding date because of my competitive stepsister?,"My stepsister “Wren” has always been competitive with me. It was mostly fuelled by her mom, who was always extremely competitive between the “families”, but Wren kept it up. I’ll admit I fed into it a bit when we were teenagers but I grew out of it. She never did. She goes out of her way to try to one-up me and she thinks everything I do is to one-up her, which isn’t the case. 

That’s the background to the main issue. Wren is getting married in November, and she’s been planning the weeding for over a year. I got engaged a month ago. My fiancé works an extremely high pressure job and because of the nature of his job, next year and the year after will be incredibly stressful. It’s part of the reason he proposed when he did. I don’t want to wait two years to get married, so I got in touch with a wedding planner who was able to work something out so that we can get married in august. It will be an extremely small wedding, a reception dinner of about 20 people over one weekend. This is in contrast to the 150 person traditional wedding that Wren has planned. 

Wren is livid that we’re planning to get married before her. She knows the reasons but she still insists that I’ve planned this to upstage her wedding. She is giving her dad no end of shit for putting money towards my wedding and helping me to humiliate her (her words). She is also causing trouble amongst mutual friends she has with my fiancé (this is not a huge deal because they’re not wanting to get involved but it was extremely embarrassing because she announced the date of our wedding before we did). 

My mom and her dad are now hinting that maybe we should move the wedding. They keep saying maybe a winter wedding (I guess after Wren’s) would be better, and that it would be nice if the family could attend both weddings with everyone on good terms. My stepbrother has also said that while he knows I didn’t do it on purpose, because of past issues this will be extremely hard for Wren to get past. He also said I was naive for thinking that just because my wedding is different from hers that she would let it go. He may be right about that. 

I still don’t really want to change the date of the wedding. I don’t think doing it in the winter will appease Wren, and two have to wait over a year just because of her childish vendetta seems grossly unfair. But I don’t like being the one to rock boat and I do sometimes feel a bit sorry for Wren. Maybe this isn’t the time to take a stand. I really don’t know if I’m in the wrong here ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for refusing to move my wedding date because of my competitive stepsister? My stepsister “Wren” has always been competitive with me. It was mostly fuelled by her mom, who was always extremely competitive between the “families”, but Wren kept it up. I’ll admit I fed into it a bit when we were teenagers but I grew out of it. She never did. She goes out of her way to try to one-up me and she thinks everything I do is to one-up her, which isn’t the case. 

That’s the background to the main issue. Wren is getting married in November, and she’s been planning the weeding for over a year. I got engaged a month ago. My fiancé works an extremely high pressure job and because of the nature of his job, next year and the year after will be incredibly stressful. It’s part of the reason he proposed when he did. I don’t want to wait two years to get married, so I got in touch with a wedding planner who was able to work something out so that we can get married in august. It will be an extremely small wedding, a reception dinner of about 20 people over one weekend. This is in contrast to the 150 person traditional wedding that Wren has planned. 

Wren is livid that we’re planning to get married before her. She knows the reasons but she still insists that I’ve planned this to upstage her wedding. She is giving her dad no end of shit for putting money towards my wedding and helping me to humiliate her (her words). She is also causing trouble amongst mutual friends she has with my fiancé (this is not a huge deal because they’re not wanting to get involved but it was extremely embarrassing because she announced the date of our wedding before we did). 

My mom and her dad are now hinting that maybe we should move the wedding. They keep saying maybe a winter wedding (I guess after Wren’s) would be better, and that it would be nice if the family could attend both weddings with everyone on good terms. My stepbrother has also said that while he knows I didn’t do it on purpose, because of past issues this will be extremely hard for Wren to get past. He also said I was naive for thinking that just because my wedding is different from hers that she would let it go. He may be right about that.

86,1dfp5ze,AITA for moving across the country and telling my daughter that they are the reason I am an “absent grandparent”,"So I have two grandkids that are 4 and 7. I live about 45 minutes away from them. At the beginning I was still working so it was hard to make time to visit them. I would go up to visit them and it sadly was not fun. I am not baby crazy and do not want to spend my whole day watching a kid sleep. So I would stay for 2 to 3 hours beofre going home. My daughter hated that I wouldn't spend more time and I told her when they are older we will bond more.

I got in a car accident, it wasn't bad and it was my fault. The sun got in my eyes and I bumbed into someone's car. In total it was like 300 dollars of damage since their car had dents in the back. It was very minor accident.

After that my daughter forbad me from driving anywhere with her kids, so now when I go up, I can't do anything with the kiddos. There is only so much I can do in the house and I would have loved to take them out to places. I have asked her to drive down since I live in a walkable area but no. It is too difficult to get them loaded up and down here.

I still tried but the more she didn't want to visit me the more I got tired of this. Not to mention she was always on me about not being more involved. I have told her so many time that you don't let me do much with them. My breaking point was last summer. I was babysitting them in the summer and I brought up a kids sprinkler. You connect it to the hose and the kids run through it on the splash pad. The kids had a great time but my daughter was pissed since it ruined the grass. The water made mud and kids running messed up the grass.

After that I just stopped trying, I told her to take he kids to me and she refused. I am retiring and selling my home.

I wish to move near the blue mountains which is across the country. I told all te kids and everyone wa a happy for me but my daughter. We got a huge fight about me being a shit grandparent. I told her she is the reason I am absent grandparent.

She calle me a jerk.

87,1dfoz1c,AITA for not leaving leftovers for my girlfriend?,"My (27M) girlfriend (30F) has no appreciation of good food. Before me, she was eating microwavable mac and cheese, jarred alfredo and noodles, salad kits and pretty much nothing else ever. Doesn't cook at all. Those things are fine or whatever, but I can't eat that everyday. I'm an amateur chef, and I like to cook. Like most days. I'm not into any crazy expensive meals or anything, but I'll put $30 into a grocery store run and make food for us all the time. At the very least, if I'm using pesto from a jar, I'll go buy some cherry tomatoes or a chicken breast and keep parmesan around. That's too much to her.



She doesn't want to contribute to dinner like *ever* claiming she's fine with microwavable ramen for dinner and can't afford to pay for groceries all the time (she makes $55k per year and we split all expenses half and half) so I end up footing the grocery bill every time I cook.  I understand, there's no way to change her relationship with food. There's no way to change mine. I'll just buy the groceries. (To clarify, we go on grocery trips together where we split the costs 50-50, we just happen to only get stuff like drinks, snacks, common ingredients sometimes.  Rarely full ingredient lists for meals)
So like 3-4 times per week, I get the urge to cook something cool and go buy all the ingredients myself, never charging her for those meals. 



So I make meals sometimes like giant pots of curry or enchiladas. Before we moved in officially, I'd take most of the leftovers home or sometimes all. I'd take the leftovers with me to work too. She claims that I'm being possessive over food and that I'm not thinking about her when I take food. I bought frozen breakfast burritos for a pre-work in a hurry meal, and she was eating them for lunch at home when there's other stuff to eat. I had an issue with that because they're for me on certain rushed mornings so I don't have to stop and get fast food. Of course she thinks that's the most unattractive quality in a partner that I did that. 



I think it's hypocritical that she says ""I didn't *ask* you to cook that food for me, I shouldn't have to pay for the groceries. Its not fair for me to spend money to fund your passion"" while simultaneously believing ""that's so selfish of you to not leave me leftovers when you cook."" She told me ""I would never ask you to pay for half of my gym membership, because that's *my* hobby, not yours""



It's not like I'm leaving her with no food. There's all kinds of stuff to eat around the place, ramen and all. Also, most of the time she actually had access to the leftovers. I just tend to take them with me to work nowadays before she comes home to eat the next day.  She just would rather eat the good food that I cooked. I don't make *that* much money. Probably about 2/3 of what she makes. I'm relatively frugal and don't like to eat out much, so expensive meals are my version of that at times. I always feed her, but am I actually selfish for this mentality?

88,1dfoysr,WIBTA if I ask for my stuff back,"So my friend/neighbor accused me of telling management she is smoking in her apartment. Her reasoning is because the day before management said something to her, I asked her to not smoke in front of me because i have lung problems post COVID. This is despite the fact I have known she's been smoking in there for 5 months and that it is now extremely noticeable in the hallway that she has been smoking in there (she stopped opening the window to smoke because it's too hot). I figured eventually someone was going to notice and she'd get in trouble that or she'd actually manage to quit cause she keeps saying she is trying. I hadn't realized she'd accuse me of telling on her. 

Anyway I feel like the trust has been broken ever since she called me a snitch and told everyone she knows that she thought it was me who told on her. I am wanting to ask for the stuff she is borrowing back and give her the stuff I'm watching for her back to her. WIBTA for that? In a way it's punishing her but I also just don't like someone who thinks so lowly of me having my stuff.

89,1dfonga,AITA for telling my girlfriend she will have to take care of walking the dog if she wants one?,"Me (M27) and my 2 yrs girlfriend (F28) are not currently living together, but hope to in the future. Talking about living together and what not, she stated that to her having a dog at someplace in our future is fundamental. I love dogs, but do see a big effort in taking care of one and always thought I would be more of a cat person in life - I'm not very keen on the idea of having to take a dog for a walk twice a day, in the long run I would consider it a burden, and I would want to make a sure a pet of mine can have a happy, healthy life, which would be harder if I get lazy and don't take it for regular walks. Basically, it wouldn't be fair to the pet.

I don't mind having a dog in my home, I just don't see myself having the patience to walk it all the time, there are days I don't want to go out of the house and that would force me to.

So I told her that I acknowledge the importance of her desire to have one, and that I would be ok, but that she shouldn't take for granted the fact that I will walk it as often as her. In the house I'll be happy to give it baths, buy it toys, clean etc, but I want her to be sure that she could bear the effort of walking the dog by herself, and not only considering me as part of the equation.

This is also because she currently lives with her family, they have two dogs, but they are family dogs so when she moves out they would remain with her parents and sister. Since her parents are the only ones who constantly take the dogs out, and she also doesn't feel like walking them most of the time, and knowing me I'm afraid I'll be the one who has to do it when she doesn't want to, just like her parents. 

She says that she would do it if her parents didn't and it was only up to her, but she also blames me for only wanting to take care of ""the fun part"" of having a dog. I do see her point, but I think a relationship is about compromises and I'm trying to compromise about having a dog - which I hadn't pictured in my life - and dog related chores, while it feels like she is reasoning in absolutes (""I have to have a dog in our life""). At the same time I feel guilty, I should trust her to be able to take care of it but previous experiences in my life led me to resenting my then partner for leaving all the workload on me and I don't want that to happen again - which is why I think these conversations beforehand are important.

Plus I really didn't love the idea of having my stepsister as a roommate. I don't really care much for her and I already live with her so I wanted a break. But one student ended up not coming because she was sick so they had an uneven number of students and we were asked to ""buddy up"" again. I chose my best friend again and because they don't like each other at all (best friend and stepsister) we were never contenders for my stepsister to share with. She ended up with two other girls. My mom and her husband were so pissed when they learned my stepsister ended up with two girls she didn't really know. It was explained to them why the buddy up happened the way it did and they told me I should have chosen my stepsister over my best friend for that, especially when my best friend has more friends and would've had more fun without me than my stepsister could.

So the issues with my best friend and stepsister started back in second grade. This was before my stepsister was my stepsister. It got worse when my mom married again because my stepsister wanted me to choose her over my best friend and I never have, never will. She wanted a sister and best friend in one but I didn't want that. Since then her jealousy got so bad. She'll complain that I do stuff with my best friend like share a bed, (on vacation we had to share a room before and only had one bed and I took the couch in the room instead) or that I shop for my best friends birthday but let mom take care of gifts for her. She's jealous that my best friend and I have matching friendship necklaces. She pestered me for selfies together because I have loads of me and my best friend and one of those is the contact photo on my phone but I have nothing special for her. I did try to hang out with my stepsister a few times but she expected me to drop my best friend so I stopped hanging out with her instead.

My stepsister was hurt I wouldn't choose her for the buddy up thing, her dad was pissed and took my phone and laptop for a week, my mom let him and told me it could have been a good chance for us to have a ""sister moment"" and when I made a face she told me I could have my stepsister a lot longer than my best friend.

93,1dfnn0r,WIBTA for raising the rent for just one tenant? ,"I (26F) share a house with my bf (34M) and our friend (28M) Jack. Jack's gf used to live with us but they broke up a few years ago so now it's just the 3 of us. 

We all get along really well, and split all the bills equally. Now the problem is Jack is incredibly lazy, my bf and I literally do all the house work, all the garden work, everything. 

Jack's bedroom is absolutely disgusting. Think all your clothes just spread out all over the floor covered in dust and food take out containers just littered amongst it, dirty cups, bowls, plates etc. No sheets on the bed just a duvet insert covered in stains. But that's his room so I have no jurisdiction there besides a small eyebrow raise and a 'you really should clean this.' I won't even go in there anymore cause it's gotten so nasty. 

The rest of the house my bf & I work so hard to keep clean, using all our non work days to do housework. On Jack's weekends he'll just disappear for 2 days and come home hungover, make a mess, and go straight to his room and order food. During the week he leaves dirty dishes, hair all over the bathroom, mud all over the shower from working outdoors, tobacco all over the kitchen counters where he insists he must roll his cigarettes despite me repeatedly asking him either not to or clean up after himself. When he gets packages delivered he'll just unbox whatever it is and leave the packaging all over the living room. Repeatedly will buy food and forget about it and it will just go mouldy in the fridge until I chuck it out.

Recently my bf & I went on holiday for 2 weeks and came home to a thick layer of sticky dust on every single surface, hair all over the bathroom, trash everywhere, all the bins overflowing and stuff actually growing in the kitchen and we had to spend 3 hours cleaning right after our plane landed.

I'm seriously considering raising his rent so he pays half and bf & I pay 1/4 each. It's not even a money thing and I don't really want him to agree I just hoping it might push him to change his ways. Even if he picked up the hoover or mop once a week or mowed the grass that would be enough, I'm not sure he's ever taken out the trash in the 5 years we've lived here. I've asked him multiple times he needs to step up but he just turns it into a joke and calls me a nag, or he says he will and just never does. 

Here is where I think I WBTA, Jack does work extremely hard. He is usually already gone before my 5am alarm and sometimes I don't hear him get home until I am in bed at 10pm. He has a very physically and mentally demanding job and is usually exhausted. 

I'm at my wits end though. Bf & I are child free and have never wanted kids, idk how we ended up in the situation where we are parents to a 28yr old man child but here we are 

Edit to add: 

It was a VERY messy breakup, we were with him through it all. This was roughly 4 years ago now though and he's moved on completely. We talk openly about mental health and check in on each other pretty much everytime we see each other. He has good and bad days but not currently spiraling or anything like that.

The messy thing is just how he is and has been like that as long as I've known him, when we all moved in together his ex used to clean up after him which I guess is why it didn't matter too much because she picked up his slack.

I realise now that my post makes it sound like I don't like him and he is insufferable but that is 100% not the case I was just venting, he is one of my closest and oldest friends and is in bf & I's main friends circle, he is actually incredibly reasonable, kind and genuinely a good guy. It's just the mess thing, whenever I bring it up he gets defensive or just walks away, it's like he doesn't see it as an issue so he doesn't understand why it has to be done.

I love every inch of her and don't think anything needs to change. Over the past few months, she went through a really rough time with some family and work stuff, and as a result ditched a lot of her exercise and healthy eating habits. As a result of overeating junk food, she put on about 10 pounds. While I tell her every day that she's beautiful (and mean it too!), she is uncomfortable and 2 weeks ago started talking about how she wants to cut out junk food, start exercising again and go back to her baseline weight. I support her efforts to return to healthier habits. 

Last week, on my way home from work as I often do I stopped in my favourite bakery in the city. I usually stop at least once per week and while in the past I would always pick up something for myself and my girlfriend, this time I only got something for myself because she's been vocal about how she will cut out pastries. I got myself a big cinnamon roll with cream cheese glaze. 

When I got home, she saw the bakery bag and asked mmm what did you get. I had to admit that I didn't get anything for her, since she said she wants to cut out pastries. She got upset and said I should have texted her when I'm in the bakery and asked if she wanted anything. I said I just didn't think she would since she's been so vocal about wanting to cut out certain foods. She then said I shouldn't have gotten anything for myself either since now I'm just ""flaunting it"" and making her feel fat. She cried a lot and she's still a bit cold towards me. 

I'm genuinely confused. AITA?

My mum was unaware of my dad's wife or my older siblings when she had me, however, despite this, rather than direct her anger at my dad, SM chooses to direct it at my mum and at me. Honestly, I'm pretty indifferent to my dad's douchebaginess, sure he's a bad person, but he's a good father.

My SM, doesn't interact with me much and treats me with indifference mostly, we exist in the same house but we don't care for each other. I don't mind this, but what I do mind is her occasional comments on my mum.

Earlier today, while I was in the conservatory studying (i like natural light), She came in on her phone, talking to her friend, and basically called mum an ugly slut in a 'look at what he cheated on me with' way.

I interrupted, and said if mum was so bad and dad cheated on SM with mum, what did that say about SM? She went red in the face, cut the call and then tried to yell at me, but I essentially called her a jealous bitter old lady, took my books and went up to my room.

A lot of this is from Karley being the baby who was babied and the center of attention for many, many years. She loves having the spotlight on her and always seemed to dislike Lauren getting any of the attention. When Lauren graduated high school a very big deal was made out of it and Karley threw a huge tantrum so their father had to leave the celebrations with Karley so Lauren and the rest of the family could celebrate. She was only 10 at the time and a kid, so I know kids don't always act the best. But that was just the beginning in what seems to be a jealousy or a resentment of Lauren whenever she gets any attention. Karley fussed when Lauren and I got married because she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid and was told she could not wear the white dress she got for it. She was 16 at the time and whined like a 6 year old over that dress. She tried to wear it on the day and was told she would be left at home if she didn't wear something else.

When she heard Lauren and I were struggling with infertility she made some snarky comments whenever anyone told us not to lose hope or that we'd be okay no matter what. Some of them were cold. Like when she said it wasn't like we lost a baby. Just shitty.

Then when Lauren did miscarry and was in the hospital, Karley announced her own pregnancy at Lauren's bedside to us and their parents. She also chose Lauren's birthday for her baby shower and shut down any mention of Lauren's birthday on the day.

Karley has a 5 year old daughter with her partner and apparently they have been trying for baby number two unsuccessfully. So when Lauren and I successfully had two children together, she went crazy. It was after our son was born actually (our youngest). He's 6 weeks old and Karley admitted to everyone in a rant that she was hoping Lauren wouldn't be able to get pregnant or would miscarry every time, she admitted to praying for that, she said someone as fat and ugly as Lauren doesn't get to have kids, while someone skinny like her should have no problems. She accused us of stealing the name she wanted for a girl when we named our daughter Ella. We had no idea she ever wanted that name and her partner said no. But apparently he agreed it could be used for a second girl. She also called Lauren a bad sister for having two kids when she was struggling to conceive again. It shocked their parents when she came out with all of this. They scolded her. But she didn't stop there and went directly to Lauren after the first outburst and said all these things to her about being selfish. Which is when I stepped in and called her a spoiled little brat. Karley and her partner said I should have stayed out of it and was cruel when it wasn't my place. Lauren was grateful because she was hurting too much at the time to respond.

98,1dfmfxb,AITA for calling my parents stupid during an argument?,"This happened less than an hour ago and I'm really conflicted. I (16,🏳️‍⚧️m) have never really gotten along with my parents, especially in recent times. I'm not going into details but there's been a lot of incidents that have solidified my belief that the best option for me when I turn 18 and go to university is to cut off all contact and get the hell away from this family for my own sake. I also just want to mention that I have an eating disorder (ARFID) and sensory issues when it comes to food, just for some context.

 About half an hour ago - so, at the point of me writing this, about 8:45am - I went downstairs to see what was in the fridge because I was hungry, took something, and went to leave. But my dad stopped me and told me to ""stop f**king eating,"" which were his own words. I said that I was hungry and he got even more upset and told me to eat something ""proper."" I asked him what I should eat since there was no bread or anything for me to make toast, and I don't like cereal because the texture of most of them, especially the ones my parents buy, make me feel nauseous. He got even angrier and told me that I was being a brat. Then he called my mother into the room because we ""needed to have a proper talk.""

My mother said that it ""felt like they were abusing me,"" by letting me eat so much junk food. I pointed out how dumb that sounded and she told me to stop arguing back, which confused me because if I didn't respond, she'd just say I wasn't listening and get even angrier anyway. They offered no real solutions outside of ""you need to eat more,"" which I will never not think is stupid. My mother then told me that I will become fat if I keep eating, which, while I do very much understand is a thing that happens, also thought was stupid because I'm not even at a healthy weight due to my disordered eating, let alone over it.

I don't really remember what happened for the next few minutes apart from a lot of back and forth since I was just kind of blanking it out, but I do remember that eventually, they came to the solution that the best way forwards would be to restrict what I eat even more, and set specific times when I can eat. I asked if they were going to be making me ""proper food"" to eat for those times and they deflected the question.

I kind of just lost it after that and called them stupid to their faces, and asked them what the hell they were trying to achieve by controlling my food intake while it's something I've been struggling with myself for ages. I pointed out that they were worried that letting me eat junk food was abuse, but that they somehow think that restricting my food and what I eat isn't, and is a perfectly normal solution. They got even angrier, said I was overreacting, that what they're going to do isn't abusive, and that they would throw out everything in the house if I came downstairs to get something to eat again before 1pm. At that point I just left.

He got even angrier and told me that I was being a brat. Then he called my mother into the room because we ""needed to have a proper talk.""

My mother said that it ""felt like they were abusing me,"" by letting me eat so much junk food. I pointed out how dumb that sounded and she told me to stop arguing back, which confused me because if I didn't respond, she'd just say I wasn't listening and get even angrier anyway. They offered no real solutions outside of ""you need to eat more,"" which I will never not think is stupid. My mother then told me that I will become fat if I keep eating, which, while I do very much understand is a thing that happens, also thought was stupid because I'm not even at a healthy weight due to my disordered eating, let alone over it.

I don't really remember what happened for the next few minutes apart from a lot of back and forth since I was just kind of blanking it out, but I do remember that eventually, they came to the solution that the best way forwards would be to restrict what I eat even more, and set specific times when I can eat. I asked if they were going to be making me ""proper food"" to eat for those times and they deflected the question.

I kind of just lost it after that and called them stupid to their faces, and asked them what the hell they were trying to achieve by controlling my food intake while it's something I've been struggling with myself for ages. I pointed out that they were worried that letting me eat junk food was abuse, but that they somehow think that restricting my food and what I eat isn't, and is a perfectly normal solution. They got even angrier, said I was overreacting, that what they're going to do isn't abusive, and that they would throw out everything in the house if I came downstairs to get something to eat again before 1pm. At that point I just left.

99,1dfmdns,"AITA for ""overreacting"" when my family talked to my daughter like she's an idiot?","Last week me (37F) my Husband (36M) and my daughter (12F) went to a family reunion

My daughter has Selective Mutism, she only ever speaks around me, her father and grandmother (my side of the family) she's always been a shy one

While we were at the reunion pretty much all of the adults would talk to her very slowly, even though she's perfectly capable of hearing and isn't stupid, I didn't know this was going on because she was playing Mario Kart with some of her cousins on their Nintendo Switch's in the basement of her grandma's (same one as mentioned earlier) home

Later that day during lunch all of the adults started talking to her like she was 3 and not 12, I told the adults that my daughter isn't dumb and that she can process words just like everyone else at the table

Now this is what caused me to go into Lois (Malcolm in The Middle) mode, my brother told me that it's not their fault she never talks and that they just thought she was special needs (she's not) and that if me ad my husband just stopped ""spoiling her"" that maybe she'd be functional

I told my husband and daughter to go to the car and that I'd be there soon and we'd leave

After the 2 of them left I let my brother and my family have it

Some of the things I said, aren't really suitable for this subreddit, I basically told them that they all might as well switch places with their kids because they're actually capable of treating my daughter with basic human respect, and that they can all fuck off, I then went to my car and told my husband that I'm done with my family and that I'm cutting them off

Flash forward to today, I was hanging out with my closet friend, same age as me, we've known eachother since the 3rd grade, I told her what happened and she told me that I overreacted and all I needed to do was just to take my husband and daughter to the car

And so we moved into our appartment in October 2022.

It was my ex-best friends birthday which we celebrated with our parents (they are in a relationship). I still haven't been feeling comfortable and honestly wanted to move out.
I also was starting school in another city soon so my way to school would've been even more difficult.
Her mother saw that I wasn't been feeling good on her daughter's birthday but I didn't want to talk about it on that day since I didn't want to ruin it for her.
When we arrived at home, she basically told me to tell her what's up so I did open up to her because I believed I could trust her.

It broke out into a huge argument that I haven't been living here long enough to say that I'm feeling unwell living here.
My ex-best friend screamed at me the whole time but I stayed calm as I was talking.
I told her, that I was sorry it had ended this way but that I will search for my own appartment in the city I will attend school.
Her and her mum said I wouldn't find another appartment for the next 1-2 years but I did search and stayed with my Boyfriend at that time.

He told them, even tho I wanted to tell them myself which basically ended in another argument in which I got called many names like c*nt and a disgrace.
I wasn't backing off with moving out why they told me I had to move out 'til October and that I had to pay every day I haven't taken all my stuff with me.
I did everything as they told me to and happily moved out with the help of my boyfriend, my Friends and my family which I am really grateful for.

105,1dflnt3,AITA for making a TikTok about how much I hate my ex best friend?,"ok guys I am very aware that the title doesn't sound the best Burt hear me out. I (14F) and my friend (14F) (let's just call my friend Mia) were in a trio with my ex bestfriend (14 no gender) (lets call them Alex). I just transferred to my new school that year with my friend Mia. Mia went to a different school than me before we both transferred at the same time, same year. Mia and I both met Alex at the same time first day of school. we all immediately got along so fast and got super close. in the first 3 days of us meeting we had our first sleepover. looking back now I do notice some red flags. Alex has autism and nothing against that and at the time I thought we could get along better because my younger brother Bruce (8M) is very high on the spectrum to the point where he can't do a lot of things and can't even talk., this caused me to make many presentations to my whole middle school about autism aweness and being accpecting to everyone no matter what (this will be important later on). during the friendship Alex would do a lot of things so here's a list below:1-peer pressure into doing substances (we didn't comply)2-ingores boundaries when set3-using autism for an excuse for everything when it had nothing to do with autistic traits or anything related to autism4-being very negative all that time constantly (EX: Alex would rather complain about being to hot instead of finding a easy solution or they would talk shit all the time, Alex told me I looked ugly when I did my hair a certain way and that I should stop doing it. just really anything negative they had to say it)5-making everything about themselfs6-never took things srsly until it came to them7-never saying that their wrong when they are8-tried to steal all my friends from my old school (not mias school though)9-just a very nosey person

so yeah because of all of this we were having problems in the friend group. during this time period we met our new friend James (14M). Alex did not like James at all in fact they had to pretend to like him. Alex accused James of saying slurs and just being an unfunny person. Mia and I eventually cut ties with Alex and Alex got angry, sad, I really can't put a word on the emotion they were feeling/describing to us. Alex shecduled a meeting with the school consluer and Mia and I did not like that (Mia and I came from bad over crowded public schools so we thought this was unnessray and was wasting the poor consluers time.) nothing really happened with the consluer Mia and I just doubled down on what we said about not wanting to be friends with Alex. 3-4 months go by and Alex hasn't spoken a word to me Mia or James (it was heaven). and suddenly Alex started talking to us again. this felt really sudden but it had been 3-4 months so Mia James and I decided to keep it civil. civil meaning if Alex talked to us, we would talk back, we never came up, texted or talked to Alex on our own free will. We all noticed that Alex was getting a bit to close and we noticed that maybe they think we are friends again (with autism and stuff I was trying to be understanding). because we noticed this we made it very clear that we were not friends with them, and never will be again. during this time where they thought we were friends with them here's what would go on: 1-they stole inside jokes between me Mia and James 2-Alex made a lot of jokes regarding my friend, James, asthma and allergies, but when the card was pointed back at them, we were the bad guys 3- bad jokes like about weight, hair, looks (I will say I did do these things to but its because I was still hurt by the things they said to me during the friendship and I understand that's still bad) 4-being so damn negative all the time

everything built up so so so so so high, with sensitive jokes (that I will not be explaining anymore of), and just being being really annoying, it got to a boiling point. on the last day of school I made a TikTok titled ""I told people to wave to the camera but in reality I just told everyone I hated to wave to the camera"". this video only included about 3-4 people but the video was about 30 secs long. you might ask ""how long where all these people waving for?"" and the answer is about one second. how I had enough people was that Alex was in this video multiple times, to the point the recurring theme was that we did not like this person, in fact we hated this person. I didn't care about what anybody thought and if I hurt anyones feelings because it just felt so good to get everything off my chest and how im never going to be seeing these people ever again so its not that big of a deal to me.

I get back home and I see a lot of nofitactions coming from my phone. the video had about 75 likes and I don't remember how many views, but it got a lot for only being posted for about 10 minutes. in the comments Alex was angry (rightfully so) and then later private messaged me and Mia on snap and messages (not James though surprisingly). Mia and I decided to give them the slient treatment (we decided to do this because during our friendship in the beginning Alex would pick fights (mostly with Mia) and then when we would try to make things better they would leave us on read/seen/devilred for a day until they calmed down and changed the subject). the slient treatment was going amazing until I told my step brother about this. He decided to take matter in his own hands and comment under my post replying to Alex's comments backing me up. sense slient treatment was broken I could read the messages Alex sent me privately. these messages said a lot but the only important one is that they asked for reasons why Mia James and I are not friends with them. after 30 minutes or so Mia and I came up with a 16 point list about why we don't want to be friends with us. this list was colored coded into 3 parts black-points blue-evidence red-solutions (we gave them solutions to help better themselves in future friendships because since we are aware they have autism its helpful to know how to fix things socially because nobody ever taught anyone these things. these solutions were actually very helpful.)

Mia and I sent the list and then went right to bed. I woke up early that morning to a present. a point checklist about me to, expect it had bad points that don't help me in the future, no evidence, and no solution. but I didn't really care. I honsetly didn't read though it and didn't care enough. I told my step brother about the list and he wanted to read it out loud. he read the list out loud and we laughed together. the list was just basically calling my albelist the whole entire time because they have autism. now remember what I said earlier about my brother having autism and that Im a public supporter of the autism commmutitym, well this comment calling my ableist got under my skin a lot. Because you guys don't know Im really close to my brother Bruce, Im really close. I sarcfirce a lot of him and my whole life revolves around Bruce (im not being over dramatic im being fr) and this comment hurt a lot because even the thought of me hurting my brother was horrible and made me sick, and thinking I hurt another person in the same community as Bruce hurt me even more. so am I the asshole?

",TL;DR,2024-06-14,"AITA for making a TikTok about how much I hate my ex best friend? ok guys I am very aware that the title doesn't sound the best Burt hear me out. I (14F) and my friend (14F) (let's just call my friend Mia) were in a trio with my ex bestfriend (14 no gender) (lets call them Alex). I just transferred to my new school that year with my friend Mia. Mia went to a different school than me before we both transferred at the same time, same year. Mia and I both met Alex at the same time first day of school. we all immediately got along so fast and got super close. in the first 3 days of us meeting we had our first sleepover. looking back now I do notice some red flags. Alex has autism and nothing against that and at the time I thought we could get along better because my younger brother Bruce (8M) is very high on the spectrum to the point where he can't do a lot of things and can't even talk., this caused me to make many presentations to my whole middle school about autism aweness and being accpecting to everyone no matter what (this will be important later on). during the friendship Alex would do a lot of things so here's a list below:1-peer pressure into doing substances (we didn't comply)2-ingores boundaries when set3-using autism for an excuse for everything when it had nothing to do with autistic traits or anything related to autism4-being very negative all that time constantly (EX: Alex would rather complain about being to hot instead of finding a easy solution or they would talk shit all the time, Alex told me I looked ugly when I did my hair a certain way and that I should stop doing it. just really anything negative they had to say it)5-making everything about themselfs6-never took things srsly until it came to them7-never saying that their wrong when they are8-tried to steal all my friends from my old school (not mias school though)9-just a very nosey person

so yeah because of all of this we were having problems in the friend group. during this time period we met our new friend James (14M). Alex did not like James at all in fact they had to pretend to like him. Alex accused James of saying slurs and just being an unfunny person. Mia and I eventually cut ties with Alex and Alex got angry, sad, I really can't put a word on the emotion they were feeling/describing to us. Alex shecduled a meeting with the school consluer and Mia and I did not like that (Mia and I came from bad over crowded public schools so we thought this was unnessray and was wasting the poor consluers time.) nothing really happened with the consluer Mia and I just doubled down on what we said about not wanting to be friends with Alex. 3-4 months go by and Alex hasn't spoken a word to me Mia or James (it was heaven). and suddenly Alex started talking to us again. this felt really sudden but it had been 3-4 months so Mia James and I decided to keep it civil. civil meaning if Alex talked to us, we would talk back, we never came up, texted or talked to Alex on our own free will. We all noticed that Alex was getting a bit to close and we noticed that maybe they think we are friends again (with autism and stuff I was trying to be understanding). because we noticed this we made it very clear that we were not friends with them, and never will be again. during this time where they thought we were friends with them here's what would go on: 1-they stole inside jokes between me Mia and James 2-Alex made a lot of jokes regarding my friend, James, asthma and allergies, but when the card was pointed back at them, we were the bad guys 3- bad jokes like about weight, hair, looks (I will say I did do these things to but its because I was still hurt by the things they said to me during the friendship and I understand that's still bad) 4-being so damn negative all the time

everything built up so so so so so high, with sensitive jokes (that I will not be explaining anymore of), and just being being really annoying, it got to a boiling point. on the last day of school I made a TikTok titled ""I told people to wave to the camera but in reality I just told everyone I hated to wave to the camera"". this video only included about 3-4 people but the video was about 30 secs long. you might ask ""how long where all these people waving for?"" and the answer is about one second. how I had enough people was that Alex was in this video multiple times, to the point the recurring theme was that we did not like this person, in fact we hated this person. I didn't care about what anybody thought and if I hurt anyones feelings because it just felt so good to get everything off my chest and how im never going to be seeing these people ever again so its not that big of a deal to me.

Since Christmas she's been pointing out things she wanted and ALL of it is green. Green water pistol: ”Can I have it for my birthday?"" Green shoes: ”Can I have it for my birthday?"" Green sheet of paper: ”Can I have it for my birthday?""

Every time, I say ""You can wish for it"", and we've been teaching her that means we know she wants it, but doesn't mean she'll get it.

Now she can use and like other colours, but green is by far her favourite.

Fast forward to last week and her birthday. We got her lots of little green things, paper, dice, a plushy, and she loved it all until we reached the one thing that wasn't green: a story book that just so happened to have a protagonist that shared her name, which we thought she would like, but the cover was primarily orange. 

Cue meltdown. She screamed that it wasn't green and threw it aside.

Now I feel like crap for knowing that this was kind of a criteria for her, but we picked something that we liked.

107,1dflax7,AITA for going on vacation without my boyfriend ,"I (27F) am going on vacation out of the country in a few weeks. My boyfriend (31M) has now given me an ultimatum. We have been together for 6 months. 

I am going to Europe for a few days with my coworker. They got 2 tickets to see Taylor Swift and know I love her and asked if I would want to go. I said yes before checking with my boyfriend because of excitement, and then later told my boyfriend about the plan. He was pissed, but ultimately said I could go because it’s my choice, but voiced he was upset I did not talk to him about it before saying yes (I agree I should have talked to him and reacted on excitement). 

Now that the trip is very soon he is saying how he is so uncomfortable with the trip and I don’t respect him because I didn’t talk to him before going on the trip. He said his future wife would never want to do any big trips without him and that me going on this trip is living a single life. All this trip would be is seeing Taylor Swift and doing touristy stuff. I would be gone for 5 nights. I’m going with my female coworker and would never cheat on him. I’m not partying at all on this trip. 

He says I have no respect for him or our relationship because I’m going on the trip. He says that I’m choosing Taylor Swift over him and how in a committed relationship I shouldn’t be making “lifetime memories” without him, and how all the big moments need to be with him now. He says if I ever want to be married with kids then I need to act like it and traveling far away without him will never get me that. We do have different past life experiences. I have had a couple of serious relationships before and he has as well, but he also has 2 kids (with 2 different women) and has had to “grow up” much faster than I ever have. I’m trying to see his side, but I don’t think this should be breakup worthy. He gave me an ultimatum, and I said I was going to go on the trip because I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong. I would never cheat or anything close to that. He has now changed his relationship status on Facebook to single as a result of this.

She was told to get there at 10am and ended in waiting til 2pm, so we were just there to support her and keep her company.

Now a relevant detail is I am fat. Not chubby, not morbidly obese, just plain old fat. Jiggly arms, fat thighs and rolls on my stomach and back. I can move, although I run quite slowly, I can wash myself fine, I don't have trouble breathing. The only medical problem I have is an hormonal imbalance which is likely the cause of half of my weight (the other half is food, because I like to eat.) The other relevant detail is that obesity runs in the family and both my mother and grandma had a gastric bypass so they could lose weight, but they were far heavier than me now.

At this point I was smiling and ready for a pleasant session of small talk, but she wasn't. She looks me dead in the eyes and with the most patronising voice ever she says: ""Are we thinking about losing weight?"".

113,1dfjuqj,AITA for disregarding family secrecy?,"22M in a household of 2 parents and 2 older siblings. I have a few millennial siblings (parents had 2 kids each when they met). We didn’t grow up with them so we don’t talk about *everything* with them so mom tells them and others, *her* versions. But it’s always 💩-talking her own kids and husband. Yep, a liar for gossip.

114,1dfjpnm,WIBTA if I gave up on driving?,"I (17) despise driving. I always knew I was going to hate it, since I was around 10 or so I just remember hating the thought of it. My parents have been very accommodating to this because they are worried that I would get into a car crash. I also think I would get into a car crash because of my awful insomnia. I fall asleep everywhere. Once I was sleeping sitting up on a rolling chair, no table, because I was just so tired.  Plus, I have astigmatism and see lights a bit weirdly so driving at night would be difficult. I also can never pay attention to anything for too long which I imagine is dangerous for being on the road. 

Here’s the big problem, the school I go to is 40 minutes away from my house, and since I can’t drive, my parents have been driving me. They are getting tired of driving for so long everyday, and I completely understand because I also hate driving for just a few minutes, I can’t imagine even half an hour. So they’re trying to get me to drive myself. 

I got my learners permit when I was 15, but only to have photo id of myself and it recently expired so I had to get a new one. My parents since then have been obsessed with getting me to drive. They signed me up for drivers ed instead of teaching me themselves, mostly because of criticism from my older siblings on their methods. The drivers ed teacher was nice but he could definitely see that I didn’t want to be there. For a while they didn’t have me do anything because I just hated it so much. He told my parents that he couldn’t teach me how to drive because I just couldn’t learn and clearly didn’t want to. My parents were very upset about this and told me to just tell them that I want to learn to drive. I’m very apprehensive about this. 

Since then my parents have been trying everything to get me to drive. They got me an electric car so I can save on gas and said once I get my license I can change the color. They mostly have been focusing on saying I can decorate the car how I want, but I don’t see the point when I can decorate my room the way I want and spend a lot more time there. Plus, they banned stickers on the car and have used it to take the dog around, so now it has a lingering smell that gives me a terrible headache. 

I don’t want to come off as being ungrateful or spoiled or anything like that, I just hate driving so much and have actual worries about it that my parents seem to have started ignoring. I have broken down crying just at the thought of being behind the wheel. My parents say it will give me a lot more freedom, but it feels like I’m being trapped into it.

Instantly my boyfriend felt disrespected. Understandable. I told him it was okay however, I disagreed with him for letting her upset him as much as she did. I wanted to continue to shop without tension. He wasn't having it. So the rest of our trip was quiet. Once we got to checkout an older white lady was our cashier. I asked her for a large paper bag for our grocery's and she said she had just gotten up to the register and didn't know where any were. I asked politely if she could find some because we had a lot of groceries and didn't want to carry them without a bag. She finally retrieved a very SMALL bag that had a rip in the bottom.

117,1dfjoeo,AITA I was smoking on my balcony and my neighbor came out on theirs above mine.,"So last Sunday night around 2am I was smoking a joint on my balcony with 2 of my friends, one of my top floor neighbors came out on theirs as well mid smoke. I think I heard them mention the smoke (I’m not going to smoke a joint ever again on the balcony) 

Anyways the next morning they dumped a bunch of water down through their balcony on to mine, which I have chairs and rugs so they were purposely doing this. They are also throwing all of their cigarette butts down on to my porch and ashing their cigarettes on to my porch.

Today I noticed there was like 15 cigarette butts on my porch so I collected them all up in a little snack baggie and threw it up to their front door. I am just tired of dealing with their nasty ass antics and their bum ass shit.

Edit: I forgot to mention this joint was NOT D9 thc normal street weed, this was Thca hemp so 100% law abiding product that I bought at a headshop. So idk if this adds anything or not but the smoking was technically legal but I was still on my balcony so this is the screw up 

Update to my update: I just thought logically and went to go talk to them by knocking on their door, we both said sorry they were apparently never mad, they claimed their dog kept knocking over the ash tray or something on those lines but fucking 15 cigarette butts is insane, as well as at least 10 burn holes all over the carpet.

118,1dfjlkh,AITA for repeatedly kicking the persons chair in front of me,"So just last night, me (19f) and my boyfriend (19f) went to go watch my brothers school performance. All was going well until we got seated. These 4 kids who were 2 years younger than us sat in front of us. They were obnoxious and loud, constantly yelling out stupid remarks like ""Oh my god! Is that Peter Pan??"" Whilst looking at a picture of Peter Pan (the play was about Peter pan) I actually ended up responding ""no its George Washington"" but ofc they ignored me as they were just doing it to be stupid which in itself was rather annoying. 

Me and my bf ignored them choosing to focus on the show but that got even harder to do as they apparently knew one of the kids that were performing so every time they saw this person they would start standing and throwing gang signs in the air trying to grab this little child's attention. Mind you they were around 16/17 and the kid was like 10 or 11. They were also constantly giggling and sitting on top of each other. Occasionally they got up and started fighting over whose chair they wanted. 

Eventually, I got tired of this and began to subtly kick the chair in front of me. Not hard but repetitively. They didn't notice at first but then began scooting their chair forward so I would not be able to reach. They also started complaining to the friends who kept looking between me and the chair. I ofc just ignored them and watched the play as I kicked.

121,1dfiw4m,AITA For letting my friend in the house to use the bathroom even though my mom doesn’t want any strangers in the house,"I am 17(M). My mother and I tend to move around a lot due to the military. While we move around a lot she’s told me to not let strangers into the house, including friends of mine. Aside from the usual stranger danger reason, she tends to not want strangers in the house because we have a lot of possessions and she considers the house to be in less than desirable condition.

Since our recent moves, we’ve had to move into smaller houses and this has resulted in my mother’s possessions being found around the house in a way that is not considered neat.

That brings us to today. I was out with my friend’s family on a hike. We were going back to their house to eat but I needed to stop by my house and pick something up before heading back out again. We planned to leave the hiking area and drive to my house and back then to my friend’s house in one go to avoid backtracking.

My friend asks me if I would mind if he used the bathroom. This friend is someone my mother has known well for about 5 years and knows his family very much as well. They go as far to consider us our their due to the time we’ve spent together. I allowed him inside if he simply used the bathroom and did nothing else.

Later when my mother arrived she was very angry at me for letting someone in. I responded by saying that it was only “insert familial friend’s name here” and that they only used the bathroom and nothing else, yet she was still very frustrated with me.

In my mind I didn’t think she would be angry with me because my friend didn’t touch anything furniture nor move anything around. I’m not exactly sure how she found out but I feel that it isn’t as big of a deal she is making it out to be because it is someone we have known for 5+ years.

I believe she is frustrated at me for letting anyone in general into the house that wasn’t me or her. Yet I’ve always thought it was simply strangers that she doesn’t know. She also states that I should’ve made my friend my friend use my bathroom instead of hers and that the house is a dump.

In my point of view, the house is not as messy as she makes it out to be. It isn’t the most cleanly place due to the sheer amount of things she owns but it isn’t a dump in my opinion.

However, due to our current living situation, I have the master bedroom and therefore the bathroom inside of the master bedroom whilst my mom has another bedroom that uses the bathroom that isn’t connected to any room. Throughout our history, all guests have used my bathroom, (even females) because my bathroom was not connected to my room since I typically had a twin sized room. But now since I have the master’s bedroom, guests now use my mother’s bathroom since she uses the one that is available to the entire house.

Aside from the usual stranger danger reason, she tends to not want strangers in the house because we have a lot of possessions and she considers the house to be in less than desirable condition.

Since our recent moves, we’ve had to move into smaller houses and this has resulted in my mother’s possessions being found around the house in a way that is not considered neat.

That brings us to today. I was out with my friend’s family on a hike. We were going back to their house to eat but I needed to stop by my house and pick something up before heading back out again. We planned to leave the hiking area and drive to my house and back then to my friend’s house in one go to avoid backtracking.

My friend asks me if I would mind if he used the bathroom. This friend is someone my mother has known well for about 5 years and knows his family very much as well. They go as far to consider us our their due to the time we’ve spent together. I allowed him inside if he simply used the bathroom and did nothing else.

Later when my mother arrived she was very angry at me for letting someone in. I responded by saying that it was only “insert familial friend’s name here” and that they only used the bathroom and nothing else, yet she was still very frustrated with me.

In my mind I didn’t think she would be angry with me because my friend didn’t touch anything furniture nor move anything around. I’m not exactly sure how she found out but I feel that it isn’t as big of a deal she is making it out to be because it is someone we have known for 5+ years.

I believe she is frustrated at me for letting anyone in general into the house that wasn’t me or her. Yet I’ve always thought it was simply strangers that she doesn’t know. She also states that I should’ve made my friend my friend use my bathroom instead of hers and that the house is a dump.

In my point of view, the house is not as messy as she makes it out to be. It isn’t the most cleanly place due to the sheer amount of things she owns but it isn’t a dump in my opinion.

However, due to our current living situation, I have the master bedroom and therefore the bathroom inside of the master bedroom whilst my mom has another bedroom that uses the bathroom that isn’t connected to any room. Throughout our history, all guests have used my bathroom, (even females) because my bathroom was not connected to my room since I typically had a twin sized room. But now since I have the master’s bedroom, guests now use my mother’s bathroom since she uses the one that is available to the entire house.

122,1dfiv2s,AITA for questioning my friendship after she got a boyfriend?,"Everyone in this story is in high school. Please keep this in mind. So I (16 yo female) have had this friend, let’s call her Sandra (also 16yo female) who I met through a mutual friend. We were very close until she got her first boyfriend, Tom. I supported and even encouraged this relationship. He seemed nice, and I have nothing against him to this day. 

However, about 6 months or so ago I’ve noticed how distant Sandra has become. Over the summer I asked her to hang out with me and a few of our other mutual friends multiple times, but she always declined, and I mean literally always. She’d say she was tired, or didn’t feel like it, but never that she had other plans. But she would constantly hang out with her boyfriend and always seemed happy to do so. Understand, I’m not upset that she’s spending time with her boyfriend. I just feel hurt that she doesn’t ever want to hang out with her friends. We have always invited her every time we hung out together, and she usually declined. The only time I saw her over the summer was on my birthday. The first few times she did this, I wasn’t upset because I figured it wouldn’t be more than a couple times. 

This became a common reoccurrence, and it started to hurt me. It felt like she didn’t care about me or our friendship. She would only hang out with me when it was convenient for her, or when she invited her boyfriend Tom as well. For example, in freshman year before my friend group could drive, Sandra came over to my house after school multiple times every week. I loved her company, and my family always welcomed her. As soon as her boyfriend got his license, she only hangs out with him after school. It feels like she ditched me. Me and my other friend, who can drive, have often invited her to hang out or get food after school, but she always says that she’d rather stay with Tom. 

Sandra and Tom have a very healthy relationship from what I understand. They see each other everyday in school, after school, and outside of school. I just don’t understand why she doesn’t hang out with me, or anyone in our friend group anymore. We don’t have much longer in high school, and I just want to spend as much time as possible with my friends before we all graduate.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-14,"AITA for questioning my friendship after she got a boyfriend?

123,1dfir5y,AITA for accidentally getting the same wedding band as my SIL,"Short post! 

I got blown up on the way home from work today from my brother. My brother saw that my fiancé ended up picking out the same wedding band as my sister in law. 

My brother started mad messaging me “we need to talk.” Sends me photos of his wives hand with the message. And I reply “lol, are the wedding bands too similar or something?” He messages “no they are exactly the same. I laugh it off and say “nice!”. He’s pissed and says “not nice!” 

Well then he calls me and says I need to fix this, unsolder the ring and pick a new one because his wife is crying. I said I am not doing that, the wedding is in a month and I just got it engraved. I said it was personal but we were really set on this band and our engagement rings are completely different!

So AITA?


Update:

Thanks for the responses. I was trying to get other perspectives on the situation but it seems everyone agrees with me. After reading all these post I felt a lot better about my decision to keep it the way it is and not change my fiancés ring.

I reached out to my brother to see if we could bury the hatchet. I said I was sorry they were upset and I had no idea it was the same wedding band. I had no ill intent accidentally picking the same ring. But I felt it was ridiculous to ask me to change it after being soldered and engraved. 

He basically told me I have a lack of empathy and this would be the same as him stealing the names I want for my kids (I’ve wanted the same names for a long time). I chuckled at that comment because I can’t own names, I don’t have kids, just go for it. This pissed him off more. He also mentioned that if the wedding band is so common and generic then what’s the problem with making us feel better and unsoldering and bringing the ring back!

I’m without words Reddit. Thanks for the comments! Really enjoying the feedback!!

I was completely sober. It was quite a serious car crash tho. One of my friends (Call her sophie) was in the car was in a relationship with one of my other good friend who wasn't in the car. 3 of the people in the car including sophie got out unharmed. Myself and 2 others got out with minor injuries. Whilst we were driving before the accident occurred 2 of the people in the car including sophie were not wearing their seatbelts. I told them about 3 times to put them on and then they called me no fun and told me i had a stick up my ass Luckily sophie finally listened to me and put her seatbelt on but one of the others didn't listen and ended up with minor injuries. After the accident i checked on everyone making sure they were all okay. 3 of us were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The other 3 went home as they were unharmed. Whilst i was in hospital getting checked up on. i messaged everyone making sure the were okay. Including Sophie's Boyfriend. I messaged him making sure she was okay and apologised for what had happened. 

A month later I had been giving Sophie's boyfriend space because i could tell he was angry about what had happened. 
I ended up bumping into him and he told me he was still angry at me for what had happened and that an apology over text doesn't count as an apology. I told him to get over himself. And that he didn't have a right to have an opinion on the car crash as he didn't experience it. I also told him he didn't have a right to be angry but he had a right to be upset. I told him to be grateful everyone was alright. He disagreed and said he had a right to be angry. I told him to grow up and get over himself and his ego

While on the phone with my parents today, the topic of the lunch was brought up and my mom mentioned that it would be rude to not invite a few other family members (who live here) to the lunch.

129,1dfh0n6,AITA for sleeping instead of taking my boyfriend car shopping?,"Yesterday evening me (23F) and my boyfriend (29M) agreed that I would take him to look at some cars this morning. He lost his previous car in a crash (not his fault) and because he's not a covered driver on my insurance I've been driving us everywhere since the accident.

This morning I woke up around 8. I asked him ""what time are we supposed to go and see the cars"" and he didn't know because the sellers hadn't responded to him yet. Since he wasn't sure I said ""ok, I'm going to go back to sleep"" and did.

I fully expected him to just wake me up when it was time to go. I am not a heavy sleeper, I am not grouchy or combative when woken up, and it hasn't been a problem in the past for him to wake me up when it's time for us to go somewhere. I didn't expect that he would need to be specifically instructed to wake me up when it was time to go. But instead I ended up waking up on my own at noon without him ever entering the bedroom at all.

I came out kind of groggy from oversleeping and asked him if the people selling the cars never got back to him. He snapped at me ""they did. HOURS ago."" I asked him if it was time to go soon and he said ""NO. We f-ing missed it because of you. And now the one I wanted is sold."" I asked him what about the other ones and he just said forget it. I asked him why he didn't wake me up and he said I chose to blow this off by going back to sleep in the first place.

He ignored me when I tried to suggest a few methods of how this could be resolved, like tell me which car it was and I'll look for similar ones nearby, until he snapped and just screamed at me that I'm selfish and I ruin everything and I can't ever be relied on for anything. Which seems extremely unfair as I've been driving double his commute to get him to and from work 6 days a week for over a month and have never missed a day. He told me he was going over to his friend's house (an alcoholic who he only ever hangs out with to get drunk) and hasn't come home or communicated with me since.

On one hand I do feel bad for oversleeping but I kind of feel like he might be using this to get back at me because i've been hounding him to replace his car so i don't need to keep driving him everywhere. Like maybe he wanted a reason to be angry with me more than he wanted to look for a new car. But my mom scolded me for sleeping in when I called and told her about it. AITA?

Edit: To answer a few questions,

1. Yes he was insured. Yes, he has the payout check from the accident. No, he hasn't spent it.

2. He's not a covered driver on my insurance because he said he wouldn't pay the cost difference if I added him on.

3. No he doesn't reimburse me for gas.

4. His friend's apartment is in walking distance, he wouldn't have needed a ride there.

6. I do not know which type of car he wanted, its actual sale status, or whether he actually did his due diligence in trying to set up a time to go see it.",0.0,0.08580252528190613,0,1
130,1dfgvv0,AITA For giving my sister “ yucky brother kisses”?,"Okay so I (13)m have a little sister (8)f. She can be really annoying sometimes like all little sisters but I love her.

I give her kisses everyday on her cheek and the top of her head. She always responds with "" gross yucky brother kisses "" and giggles our parents always tell me she's just being a silly kid and that it's fine for me to keep kissing her. 

But the other day my gf (13)f was over at my house and saw me kissing my sister and my sister went "" gross yucky brother kisses "" and giggled again, when my sister was out of the room my gf got really mad asking me what was wrong with me kissing my sister when she clearly didnt like it. I told her I kiss her like that everyday and have for a long time and our parents say it's okay. 

She said it was a horrible thing to do and got up and called her parents to pick her up cuz she didn't want to be around me. 

I tried to talk to her today but she just told me to leave her alone. 

I asked my parents about it again and they both said there's nothing wrong with giving my sister big brother kisses and that it's sweet and cute.

Im still not sure what to do my gf says I have to stop kissing my sister but my parents say it's okay.

Edit: Okay I'm going to talk to my sister tomorrow and ask her if she doesn't like it when I kiss her and if she wants me to stop. If she wants me to stop I will stop if she doesn't more yucky brother kisses for her.

Edit: I talked to my sister today and asked her if she says my kisses are yucky because she really doesn't like them and if she wants me to stop. She said she loves my loves my kisses and ""they're not that yucky"" LOL. I'm glad I know she is okay my kisses now. Thanks everyone for your help. Im off to give my sister some yucky brother kisses.
