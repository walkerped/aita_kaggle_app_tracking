0,1dgql47,AITA for refusing to expose my daughter‚Äôs transgender bully?,"My (39F) daughter (16F) has been best friends with this girl who I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúJuniper‚Äù (16F) since they were both 9 years old. Juniper was originally a biological boy, but came out as a transgender girl a few years ago. Her parents are very old fashioned Catholics, so they‚Äôre still unaware that she‚Äôs trans. Last year, Juniper had a falling out with my daughter because someone sent her an anonymous blackmail message threatening to out her as trans to her parents, and Juniper assumed that it was from my daughter.

My daughter is very shy and has a hard time making friends, so she‚Äôs stuck to the same friend group for the past several years. Juniper told all their friends that they had to choose a side, and all of them chose Juniper‚Äôs. She also forbade them from talking to my daughter out of loyalty to her. I‚Äôve tried to get her to forget about them fake friends and make some new ones, but she says there‚Äôs no point in making new friends when the friend‚Äôs she‚Äôs known for so long ditched her just like that. Additionally, even classmates she used to be friendly with have started to become standoffish with her, which she thinks is because of Juniper. I suggested joining an extracurricular club, but she said she had to leave them all since Juniper shared the same interests as her and has influenced the other members into ignoring her. My daughter is miserable at school. She hides in a bathroom stall all lunchtime and sometimes even skips lunch because of how embarrassing it is to eat alone in the cafeteria.

A few days ago, she confronted Juniper to try and tell her it was a misunderstanding. It turns out that several weeks prior, Juniper had already found out the truth - it had been her ex boyfriend who blackmailed her, not my daughter. My daughter asked why hasn‚Äôt she apologised and made it up to her yet, and Juniper said that the friend group realized they preferred hanging out without her.

My daughter asked me for the contact information of Juniper‚Äôs parents. I told her that I would happily talk to Juniper‚Äôs parents on her behalf, but my daughter insisted on talking to them herself. It turned out that my daughter had concocted a plan. She gathered evidence of Juniper being trans: text messages, social media posts, photos. She planned on sending everything to Juniper‚Äôs parents, knowing full well they would disown her if they found out.

I told her it was an awful idea. Juniper may be a bully, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should stoop to her level. If I outed her, she would lose her home and her family, and I can't in good conscience put a 16 year old in such a precarious situation. My daughter was furious with me and accused me of choosing Juniper over her. She thinks I'm being unfair by protecting her bully.

We accepted.



A day later, F told GF he had an answer for us. She called me and handed the phone to him, where he told me that I threatened him and to stay away from the house & his wife/younger daughter.

My GF is completely on my side, and has numerous issues with F around communication, the way he treats M, and a few other things. He is a massive hypocrite and listens to metal music, but won't allow horror movies in the house, as an example. I voiced to my GF that I think he is a misogynist & a homophobe.

3,1dgkq6h,WIBTA if I told my boss to start gendering her daughter correctly in front of hotel guests,"I (25NB) started a front desk job at a hotel 2 months ago. Once I was offered the job I asked to be called James. I was nervous but my boss (52F) immediately responded, ‚ÄúYou are in the right place, James.‚Äù She told me her daughter (17MtF) transitioned. That obviously made me hopeful, and since then, I‚Äôve met her daughter and have been able to have good casual talks about transitioning with everyone I work with, including my boss.

I have to describe the hotel culture bc it matters. Since we aren‚Äôt corporate but are still incredibly nice and in a beautiful spot, guests develop close relationships with the staff and come back year after year, some for 2+ generations. My boss has worked here 15 years so guests often hug her upon arrival and are overall extremely friendly. Many of them heard about her ‚Äúson‚Äù growing up over the years. The guests are mostly age 50+ wealthy white couples/families. (BTW - we don‚Äôt get tips of any kind at the front desk, so she isn‚Äôt buttering anyone up for money.) 

When I first started to be uncomfortable with my boss, it was actually about ME. I started hormone therapy 5 weeks ago, so my voice betrays my otherwise pretty androgynous appearance, especially on the phone. Most guests will ‚Äúassume‚Äù I said Jane instead of James, or misgender me in person despite my clearly masc name. My boss has also repeatedly misgendered me ‚Äî ‚Äúslip-ups‚Äù that rarely go acknowledged. She hears me repeat my name on difficult phone calls and laughs bc I‚Äôve made jokes before, but she doesn‚Äôt understand you can‚Äôt always brush it off.

I made the decision to wait out my contract (ends in November) before finding something new bc job hunting is exhausting and I can deal with it. HOWEVER.

~2 weeks ago, my boss greeted some guests and started talking about her ‚Äúson‚Äôs‚Äù upcoming graduation party. SHE misgendered first, not the guests. Previously, my boss told me she always went neutral and just says ‚Äúkid‚Äù now. She literally started off that way, and the guests were following her lead, but then she switched pronouns so the guests did too.

It‚Äôs happened again since then, so I want to try to explain to her that it‚Äôs an extreme betrayal. Her reasoning has been that it would be an awkward conversation to have 300 times with people she barely sees. Trust me, I KNOW. But she‚Äôs not trying, and I know she doesn‚Äôt understand what a real failure it is even if she thinks she‚Äôs being supportive to her daughter at home. 

However, I also don‚Äôt know whether she spoke to her daughter about this. I believe their family is actually very open. It could be her daughter doesn‚Äôt care what happens here, or even wants to avoid the attention. I don‚Äôt want to insert myself into my boss‚Äôs family business as some kind of trans crusader, but I also think it‚Äôs making her complacent about how I, and other trans people, can be normalized and treated in public.

6,1dg7i9f,AITA f)or giving my brother's Discord to a girl without asking him?,"Last week, I (21M) took my little brother (15) to an anime convention in our state. It was my brother's first time going to one, and he's pretty nerdy to boot, so he had been very excited about going in the weeks leading up.

My brother isn't a very social kid, by his own admission, he's a massive introvert. He doesn't have a ton of IRL friends, and on the drive up to the hotel room, he told me he ""Wanted to make at least one friend"" during the weekend, I told him I'd help if I could.

Early in the second day of the convention, me and him are waiting in line for the dealer's hall to open, and in front of us is a girl about my brother's age, playing on a Nintendo Switch.

I ask her what games she plays, and when she mentioned one that my brother (a huge Nintendo fanboy) had played, I say, ""Oh, my brother here is a big fan of those too, isn't that right, (Brother's Name)?""

He sheepishly agrees and to my surprise, actually starts talking to the girl about the game, and then some other ones, before moving on to other nerdy things they had a shared interest in. It was the most I'd ever seen my brother interact with a stranger, and it made me very happy to see.

Eventually the dealer's hall opens, and me, my brother, and the girl all end up at the same booth, buying merch. As we're checking out, I point to the girl and ask what my brother thought, he just as sheepishly tells me that he thought she was cool and kind of cute.

""You should go ask for her Discord, I bet she'd give it to you.""

""No."" is all he says in response.

When I press him on why, he says he's nervous about coming off as creepy and besides, what if she says no?

I tell him that as long as he isn't approaching her in a creepy way, then he probably doesn't have to worry about that, and if she says no, then she says no. That rejection is part of getting to know people, and learning to handle it well when you're young would be a big help for when he's an adult.

He tells me no again, and by that time, the girl is gone anyways.

Later during that day, me and my brother got separated, and I was walking around on my own. At some point, I notice the girl at a booth and go up to her.

I ask what she thought of my brother, and her response was remarkably similar to my brother's. She thought he was funny and cute, and wanted to talk to him more about Switch games.

I offered to give her my brother's Discord, and she agrees.

A few hours later, she finally messages him, a simply 'hey' with an introduction and how she got his Discord. My brother was PISSED, he immediately started telling me that it was a total breach of his privacy to give out his Discord without his permission. I pointed out that he had told me that he wanted to make friends at the convention, and that I basically dropped one at his feet.

Last week, I (21M) took my little brother (15) to an anime convention in our state. It was my brother's first time going to one, and he's pretty nerdy to boot, so he had been very excited about going in the weeks leading up.

My brother isn't a very social kid, by his own admission, he's a massive introvert. He doesn't have a ton of IRL friends, and on the drive up to the hotel room, he told me he ""Wanted to make at least one friend"" during the weekend, I told him I'd help if I could.

Early in the second day of the convention, me and him are waiting in line for the dealer's hall to open, and in front of us is a girl about my brother's age, playing on a Nintendo Switch.

I ask her what games she plays, and when she mentioned one that my brother (a huge Nintendo fanboy) had played, I say, ""Oh, my brother here is a big fan of those too, isn't that right, (Brother's Name)?""

He sheepishly agrees and to my surprise, actually starts talking to the girl about the game, and then some other ones, before moving on to other nerdy things they had a shared interest in. It was the most I'd ever seen my brother interact with a stranger, and it made me very happy to see.

Eventually the dealer's hall opens, and me, my brother, and the girl all end up at the same booth, buying merch. As we're checking out, I point to the girl and ask what my brother thought, he just as sheepishly tells me that he thought she was cool and kind of cute.

""You should go ask for her Discord, I bet she'd give it to you.""

""No."" is all he says in response.

I‚Äôll note that these have twice the noice cancelling capacity of the previous model, and as I‚Äôm sitting here typing I have a big box fan in the window on full speed and music in my AirPods. It works really well.

Today I came home from work and my husband asked if I had to stay late, I told him that I didn‚Äôt but that I finally broke down and got new AirPods because the old ones kicked it a while back. I said it was my birthday soon so I just wanted a little something and that if he wants to he can skip getting something else for me (we share finances, so while I could have labeled this a personal purchase I was offering to say we each paid half and he didn‚Äôt have to worry about it if he didn‚Äôt want to), because I know $189 isn‚Äôt super cheap (down from $249 so I got it on sale). This part he was fine with, and even said that he still wanted to get something for me.

I told him I was going to go and try out the noise cancellation and other features. Cut to an hour and a half later, and I‚Äôm listening to music and reading my book. Totally forgot I left noise cancellation on when it didn‚Äôt need to be. My husband comes in and looks angry, so I turned off noise cancellation and asked what was wrong. Apparently he‚Äôd yelled from the kitchen several times to ask if I had any opinions about dinner, and then eventually got mad and decided to make whatever he felt like (I‚Äôm fine with that, I‚Äôll eat it) - he did make enough for two. 

He‚Äôs mad at me now, and he said that if I knew the noise cancellation was so good that I wouldn‚Äôt hear him yelling for me then I shouldn‚Äôt use it. I argued that the noise cancellation was half the point of getting the nicer model, and that he knew I was going to be testing them and that noise cancelation was a feature I‚Äôd be testing out. I said that I was sorry he shouted a bunch and felt ignored, but that I also hate when he does that and he knew that I‚Äôd be hearing impaired while I played with my new toys. He got annoyed with that and said that I should be available audibly when I‚Äôm at home, because otherwise he can‚Äôt get my attention unless he waved his hand in my face - I said he could have texted me at any point and I would have come down/texted. 

He said it was a dick move to intentionally not be able to hear other people in your house, and then went to eat his portion of dinner outside and left me inside.

She has said multiple times to many people how childish the invite looked, how I have poor taste, etc. Again, it was not even something I had put any work into, just something I was looking at. This week, I finally found a wedding invite both me and my FH thought looked nice, and had something that was important in our lives (deer hunting) in a classy way. I put in all the info, edited it, and sent it to my FMIL to see what she thought. She loved it. My mom saw it, and proceeded to blow up on me. Her major complaints being: The antlers look stupid, there is no mention of your parents on the invite anywhere (they claimed its customary for the invite to say ‚ÄúMoB and FoB and MoG and DoG invite you to the wedding of‚Ä¶‚Äù which we could find no evidence of that being a thing), and for catering there isn‚Äôt a meat choice they get both meats. This turned into a MAJOR blow up yesterday, as my FH finally hit his limit with how we have been treated. He said ‚ÄúIt feels like we‚Äôre not even the ones getting married since we cant seem to pick out one thing without them hating it.‚Äù 

Last night, we had a dinner with the wedding party. My brother (was a groomsman) showed up, and demanded we apologize to my parents for how we have acted and the pain we have put them through. We tried to explain he has only got one side of the story, but he did not want to hear it. He kept making vague threats that my family was going to cut me, even bringing up trying to go after my house (they are cosigners but have not made payments) He also recorded the whole conversation to show my parents. 

My brother has now said he wont be involved in the wedding anymore until we apologize, and let my parents make the choices. This is where I may be TA, because I refuse to apologize for mine or my FH actions. I understand that my parents are paying for the wedding, but it seems like its just a showcase of how great our family is doing, not an event about the love between two people. 

I love my family, and would be crushed if they didn‚Äôt attend my wedding, but I cant keep going like this. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-15,"AITA for not apologizing?  I (23F) and my fiancee (24M) are getting married this year. We have been together for almost three years at this point, and got engaged 6 months ago. 

Since getting engaged, its felt like a constant power struggle with my mom specifically. She has made choices I either didnt like or didnt choose, but claims it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhat I wanted‚Äù because it ‚Äúfits the aesthetic‚Äù of the wedding theme. She also has begun using the term ‚ÄúI pay, I say‚Äù when it comes to choices for the wedding. There have been multiple instances recently that have resulted in fights, but this is the most recent

17,1dg550i,AITA for always trying to hide my food from my family?,"I am 15F, I always disliked when my family eats my stuff, especially if it's not for the house. As I am writing this, yesterday, my father and I went to the grocery store to go and buy my aunt some ketchup. My father asked me if I wanted anything, remembering that my band teacher was having an end of year party as we can bring in food and drinks to share with other band members, I didn't want to seem selfish or be the only person not bringing anything, so I decided to buy some brownie bites, they were small brownies inside a container for a good price. When I returned back to my aunt's house, I put them on the counter, this is when the ""my family eating my stuff"" comes in, my cousin, 26F, brings her three children, 5M, 3F & 3F(theyre twins), to my aunt's house for her mother to watch them as she's slacking off with her girlfriend, not doing anything really important where she can't take care of her own kids, everytime they come over, they immediately EAT. Literally anything edible in sight, is eaten. My cousin doesn't seem to care what they eat as long as they eat something, but what spites me is when she has them specifically eat MY stuff. I remember one time, going to a Costco, and buying muffins for my own use, specifically blueberry and cornbread (as I thought nobody would eat the cornbread), I come downstairs to get a muffin, and I notice her children eating them. They also waste food, if you were to give them something as big as the muffins that they were eating, they wouldn't finish it and just waste it, as that's what happened. This really angered me as I don't like when people eat my stuff. Traveling back to now, I come downstairs again, and I notice that the brownies were half-way full inside the container when it used to be up to the top. So what I did is I put them on the very top shelf of the cabinet in order to hide them in which nobody would reach (because most people inside my family are short), backfired. My aunt calls me downstairs and yells at me for putting them on the top shelf even though she didn't buy them, doesn't eat them, and doesn't have control over what I do with them. I practically have no choice but to let my stuff be eaten out before I can even get a bite myself as I try to explain this to my cousin, but her being arrogant and doesn't care genuinely pisses me off.
