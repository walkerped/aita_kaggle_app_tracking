0,1dgql47,AITA for refusing to expose my daughter‚Äôs transgender bully?,"My (39F) daughter (16F) has been best friends with this girl who I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúJuniper‚Äù (16F) since they were both 9 years old. Juniper was originally a biological boy, but came out as a transgender girl a few years ago. Her parents are very old fashioned Catholics, so they‚Äôre still unaware that she‚Äôs trans. Last year, Juniper had a falling out with my daughter because someone sent her an anonymous blackmail message threatening to out her as trans to her parents, and Juniper assumed that it was from my daughter.

My daughter is very shy and has a hard time making friends, so she‚Äôs stuck to the same friend group for the past several years. Juniper told all their friends that they had to choose a side, and all of them chose Juniper‚Äôs. She also forbade them from talking to my daughter out of loyalty to her. I‚Äôve tried to get her to forget about them fake friends and make some new ones, but she says there‚Äôs no point in making new friends when the friend‚Äôs she‚Äôs known for so long ditched her just like that. Additionally, even classmates she used to be friendly with have started to become standoffish with her, which she thinks is because of Juniper. I suggested joining an extracurricular club, but she said she had to leave them all since Juniper shared the same interests as her and has influenced the other members into ignoring her. My daughter is miserable at school. She hides in a bathroom stall all lunchtime and sometimes even skips lunch because of how embarrassing it is to eat alone in the cafeteria.

A few days ago, she confronted Juniper to try and tell her it was a misunderstanding. It turns out that several weeks prior, Juniper had already found out the truth - it had been her ex boyfriend who blackmailed her, not my daughter. My daughter asked why hasn‚Äôt she apologised and made it up to her yet, and Juniper said that the friend group realized they preferred hanging out without her.

My daughter asked me for the contact information of Juniper‚Äôs parents. I told her that I would happily talk to Juniper‚Äôs parents on her behalf, but my daughter insisted on talking to them herself. It turned out that my daughter had concocted a plan. She gathered evidence of Juniper being trans: text messages, social media posts, photos. She planned on sending everything to Juniper‚Äôs parents, knowing full well they would disown her if they found out.

I told her it was an awful idea. Juniper may be a bully, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should stoop to her level. If I outed her, she would lose her home and her family, and I can't in good conscience put a 16 year old in such a precarious situation. My daughter was furious with me and accused me of choosing Juniper over her. She thinks I'm being unfair by protecting her bully.

We accepted.



A day later, F told GF he had an answer for us. She called me and handed the phone to him, where he told me that I threatened him and to stay away from the house & his wife/younger daughter.

My GF is completely on my side, and has numerous issues with F around communication, the way he treats M, and a few other things. He is a massive hypocrite and listens to metal music, but won't allow horror movies in the house, as an example. I voiced to my GF that I think he is a misogynist & a homophobe.

3,1dgkq6h,WIBTA if I told my boss to start gendering her daughter correctly in front of hotel guests,"I (25NB) started a front desk job at a hotel 2 months ago. Once I was offered the job I asked to be called James. I was nervous but my boss (52F) immediately responded, ‚ÄúYou are in the right place, James.‚Äù She told me her daughter (17MtF) transitioned. That obviously made me hopeful, and since then, I‚Äôve met her daughter and have been able to have good casual talks about transitioning with everyone I work with, including my boss.

I have to describe the hotel culture bc it matters. Since we aren‚Äôt corporate but are still incredibly nice and in a beautiful spot, guests develop close relationships with the staff and come back year after year, some for 2+ generations. My boss has worked here 15 years so guests often hug her upon arrival and are overall extremely friendly. Many of them heard about her ‚Äúson‚Äù growing up over the years. The guests are mostly age 50+ wealthy white couples/families. (BTW - we don‚Äôt get tips of any kind at the front desk, so she isn‚Äôt buttering anyone up for money.) 

When I first started to be uncomfortable with my boss, it was actually about ME. I started hormone therapy 5 weeks ago, so my voice betrays my otherwise pretty androgynous appearance, especially on the phone. Most guests will ‚Äúassume‚Äù I said Jane instead of James, or misgender me in person despite my clearly masc name. My boss has also repeatedly misgendered me ‚Äî ‚Äúslip-ups‚Äù that rarely go acknowledged. She hears me repeat my name on difficult phone calls and laughs bc I‚Äôve made jokes before, but she doesn‚Äôt understand you can‚Äôt always brush it off.

I made the decision to wait out my contract (ends in November) before finding something new bc job hunting is exhausting and I can deal with it. HOWEVER.

~2 weeks ago, my boss greeted some guests and started talking about her ‚Äúson‚Äôs‚Äù upcoming graduation party. SHE misgendered first, not the guests. Previously, my boss told me she always went neutral and just says ‚Äúkid‚Äù now. She literally started off that way, and the guests were following her lead, but then she switched pronouns so the guests did too.

It‚Äôs happened again since then, so I want to try to explain to her that it‚Äôs an extreme betrayal. Her reasoning has been that it would be an awkward conversation to have 300 times with people she barely sees. Trust me, I KNOW. But she‚Äôs not trying, and I know she doesn‚Äôt understand what a real failure it is even if she thinks she‚Äôs being supportive to her daughter at home. 

However, I also don‚Äôt know whether she spoke to her daughter about this. I believe their family is actually very open. It could be her daughter doesn‚Äôt care what happens here, or even wants to avoid the attention. I don‚Äôt want to insert myself into my boss‚Äôs family business as some kind of trans crusader, but I also think it‚Äôs making her complacent about how I, and other trans people, can be normalized and treated in public.

6,1dg7i9f,AITA f)or giving my brother's Discord to a girl without asking him?,"Last week, I (21M) took my little brother (15) to an anime convention in our state. It was my brother's first time going to one, and he's pretty nerdy to boot, so he had been very excited about going in the weeks leading up.

My brother isn't a very social kid, by his own admission, he's a massive introvert. He doesn't have a ton of IRL friends, and on the drive up to the hotel room, he told me he ""Wanted to make at least one friend"" during the weekend, I told him I'd help if I could.

Early in the second day of the convention, me and him are waiting in line for the dealer's hall to open, and in front of us is a girl about my brother's age, playing on a Nintendo Switch.

I ask her what games she plays, and when she mentioned one that my brother (a huge Nintendo fanboy) had played, I say, ""Oh, my brother here is a big fan of those too, isn't that right, (Brother's Name)?""

He sheepishly agrees and to my surprise, actually starts talking to the girl about the game, and then some other ones, before moving on to other nerdy things they had a shared interest in. It was the most I'd ever seen my brother interact with a stranger, and it made me very happy to see.

Eventually the dealer's hall opens, and me, my brother, and the girl all end up at the same booth, buying merch. As we're checking out, I point to the girl and ask what my brother thought, he just as sheepishly tells me that he thought she was cool and kind of cute.

""You should go ask for her Discord, I bet she'd give it to you.""

""No."" is all he says in response.

When I press him on why, he says he's nervous about coming off as creepy and besides, what if she says no?

I tell him that as long as he isn't approaching her in a creepy way, then he probably doesn't have to worry about that, and if she says no, then she says no. That rejection is part of getting to know people, and learning to handle it well when you're young would be a big help for when he's an adult.

He tells me no again, and by that time, the girl is gone anyways.

Later during that day, me and my brother got separated, and I was walking around on my own. At some point, I notice the girl at a booth and go up to her.

I ask what she thought of my brother, and her response was remarkably similar to my brother's. She thought he was funny and cute, and wanted to talk to him more about Switch games.

I offered to give her my brother's Discord, and she agrees.

A few hours later, she finally messages him, a simply 'hey' with an introduction and how she got his Discord. My brother was PISSED, he immediately started telling me that it was a total breach of his privacy to give out his Discord without his permission. I pointed out that he had told me that he wanted to make friends at the convention, and that I basically dropped one at his feet.

Last week, I (21M) took my little brother (15) to an anime convention in our state. It was my brother's first time going to one, and he's pretty nerdy to boot, so he had been very excited about going in the weeks leading up.

My brother isn't a very social kid, by his own admission, he's a massive introvert. He doesn't have a ton of IRL friends, and on the drive up to the hotel room, he told me he ""Wanted to make at least one friend"" during the weekend, I told him I'd help if I could.

Early in the second day of the convention, me and him are waiting in line for the dealer's hall to open, and in front of us is a girl about my brother's age, playing on a Nintendo Switch.

I ask her what games she plays, and when she mentioned one that my brother (a huge Nintendo fanboy) had played, I say, ""Oh, my brother here is a big fan of those too, isn't that right, (Brother's Name)?""

He sheepishly agrees and to my surprise, actually starts talking to the girl about the game, and then some other ones, before moving on to other nerdy things they had a shared interest in. It was the most I'd ever seen my brother interact with a stranger, and it made me very happy to see.

Eventually the dealer's hall opens, and me, my brother, and the girl all end up at the same booth, buying merch. As we're checking out, I point to the girl and ask what my brother thought, he just as sheepishly tells me that he thought she was cool and kind of cute.

""You should go ask for her Discord, I bet she'd give it to you.""

""No."" is all he says in response.

I‚Äôll note that these have twice the noice cancelling capacity of the previous model, and as I‚Äôm sitting here typing I have a big box fan in the window on full speed and music in my AirPods. It works really well.

Today I came home from work and my husband asked if I had to stay late, I told him that I didn‚Äôt but that I finally broke down and got new AirPods because the old ones kicked it a while back. I said it was my birthday soon so I just wanted a little something and that if he wants to he can skip getting something else for me (we share finances, so while I could have labeled this a personal purchase I was offering to say we each paid half and he didn‚Äôt have to worry about it if he didn‚Äôt want to), because I know $189 isn‚Äôt super cheap (down from $249 so I got it on sale). This part he was fine with, and even said that he still wanted to get something for me.

I told him I was going to go and try out the noise cancellation and other features. Cut to an hour and a half later, and I‚Äôm listening to music and reading my book. Totally forgot I left noise cancellation on when it didn‚Äôt need to be. My husband comes in and looks angry, so I turned off noise cancellation and asked what was wrong. Apparently he‚Äôd yelled from the kitchen several times to ask if I had any opinions about dinner, and then eventually got mad and decided to make whatever he felt like (I‚Äôm fine with that, I‚Äôll eat it) - he did make enough for two. 

He‚Äôs mad at me now, and he said that if I knew the noise cancellation was so good that I wouldn‚Äôt hear him yelling for me then I shouldn‚Äôt use it. I argued that the noise cancellation was half the point of getting the nicer model, and that he knew I was going to be testing them and that noise cancelation was a feature I‚Äôd be testing out. I said that I was sorry he shouted a bunch and felt ignored, but that I also hate when he does that and he knew that I‚Äôd be hearing impaired while I played with my new toys. He got annoyed with that and said that I should be available audibly when I‚Äôm at home, because otherwise he can‚Äôt get my attention unless he waved his hand in my face - I said he could have texted me at any point and I would have come down/texted. 

He said it was a dick move to intentionally not be able to hear other people in your house, and then went to eat his portion of dinner outside and left me inside.

She has said multiple times to many people how childish the invite looked, how I have poor taste, etc. Again, it was not even something I had put any work into, just something I was looking at. This week, I finally found a wedding invite both me and my FH thought looked nice, and had something that was important in our lives (deer hunting) in a classy way. I put in all the info, edited it, and sent it to my FMIL to see what she thought. She loved it. My mom saw it, and proceeded to blow up on me. Her major complaints being: The antlers look stupid, there is no mention of your parents on the invite anywhere (they claimed its customary for the invite to say ‚ÄúMoB and FoB and MoG and DoG invite you to the wedding of‚Ä¶‚Äù which we could find no evidence of that being a thing), and for catering there isn‚Äôt a meat choice they get both meats. This turned into a MAJOR blow up yesterday, as my FH finally hit his limit with how we have been treated. He said ‚ÄúIt feels like we‚Äôre not even the ones getting married since we cant seem to pick out one thing without them hating it.‚Äù 

Last night, we had a dinner with the wedding party. My brother (was a groomsman) showed up, and demanded we apologize to my parents for how we have acted and the pain we have put them through. We tried to explain he has only got one side of the story, but he did not want to hear it. He kept making vague threats that my family was going to cut me, even bringing up trying to go after my house (they are cosigners but have not made payments) He also recorded the whole conversation to show my parents. 

My brother has now said he wont be involved in the wedding anymore until we apologize, and let my parents make the choices. This is where I may be TA, because I refuse to apologize for mine or my FH actions. I understand that my parents are paying for the wedding, but it seems like its just a showcase of how great our family is doing, not an event about the love between two people.

As I am writing this, yesterday, my father and I went to the grocery store to go and buy my aunt some ketchup. My father asked me if I wanted anything, remembering that my band teacher was having an end of year party as we can bring in food and drinks to share with other band members, I didn't want to seem selfish or be the only person not bringing anything, so I decided to buy some brownie bites, they were small brownies inside a container for a good price. When I returned back to my aunt's house, I put them on the counter, this is when the ""my family eating my stuff"" comes in, my cousin, 26F, brings her three children, 5M, 3F & 3F(theyre twins), to my aunt's house for her mother to watch them as she's slacking off with her girlfriend, not doing anything really important where she can't take care of her own kids, everytime they come over, they immediately EAT. Literally anything edible in sight, is eaten. My cousin doesn't seem to care what they eat as long as they eat something, but what spites me is when she has them specifically eat MY stuff. I remember one time, going to a Costco, and buying muffins for my own use, specifically blueberry and cornbread (as I thought nobody would eat the cornbread), I come downstairs to get a muffin, and I notice her children eating them. They also waste food, if you were to give them something as big as the muffins that they were eating, they wouldn't finish it and just waste it, as that's what happened. This really angered me as I don't like when people eat my stuff. Traveling back to now, I come downstairs again, and I notice that the brownies were half-way full inside the container when it used to be up to the top. So what I did is I put them on the very top shelf of the cabinet in order to hide them in which nobody would reach (because most people inside my family are short), backfired. My aunt calls me downstairs and yells at me for putting them on the top shelf even though she didn't buy them, doesn't eat them, and doesn't have control over what I do with them. I practically have no choice but to let my stuff be eaten out before I can even get a bite myself as I try to explain this to my cousin, but her being arrogant and doesn't care genuinely pisses me off.

19,1dgv0pm,AITA for screaming at my childhood friend at her sister's party?,"I (24F) has a childhood friend (24F) who I'll call Sarah. I was asked by her sister (27F) to sing at her party because she wanted a live band celebrating getting her PhD. I used to sing alot but it has been like 2 years since I last sang infront of people. I got together with friends I played live with before. We practice for 3 months before the party. 

Now to the party, Sarah helped us setup and we talked about casual stuff, mostly about the party and how proud she is of her sisters hard work. I started to get stage fright which is normal for me but it has been a while since I was on a stage so it was quite intense so I went into a seperate room and Sarah followed. Sarah started to talk about her ex which she frankly has nagged my ear off about for over a year. I asked her to please talk about something else or let me have some space because I felt anxious. She didn't stop and kept on talking until she made herself cry and I just got angry instead and snapped. I told her to leave me alone because I felt like shit and she didn't make it better. She didn't leave so I went out where the party had already started and my anxiety got worse that I could feel a weird feeling in my chest and felt like crying. 

I went up on stage and I did terrible, my voice was really shaky but I don't think the notes were false, the people watching atleast seemed to have a good time but it was nowhere near as good as we had practised. 

After the set I went out to get some air and Sarah  had apparently followed me out. She started to tell me I made her feel bad for getting angry at her and I never felt such rage, it felt like someone took the lid off for my anger regarding this subject. 

I screamed at her no I'm not sorry, I told her I was feeling anxious and she made it about her and I'm not her psychiatrist and she should get help. Here is where I think I might be an asshole, I yelled at her that she is selfish trying to make everything about her and the fact that she take it up during her sister's party even if we were in a private room it is disrespectful to her sister to dampen the mood to everyone around her to get sympathy. That she has made her ex seem like a prince charming but he's just an alcoholic hateful racist and creep who cheated on her and he dumped her.

She ruined my mood and made me feel like shit before, on and after playing live instead of being supportive. 

She just left to go home, I went into the party after calming down and had a good time, got some compliments I didn't feel I deserved but started to feel better. The band told me to leave the cleaning up to them, they probably noticed I didn't feel too good.

20,1dguw9p,AITA for closing our shared credit card,"So like the title says, but here's more context:

I got the Apple credit card in 2021 and added my now ex girlfriend to it when I got it (we had been together since 2019 at this time) and when I opened it they gave me an 11k limit. She broke up with me a few months ago and she's been the primary person using the card since we got it. I've used it for one major purchase in its history which was for a PC but I paid off the entire purchase on the following month. It has almost always been at 75-100% utilization and has always hurt my credit but I figured that until I finish school and get a better job, I'll let her manage it on her own since she was basically the exclusive person using it. 

Now here's my dilemma, and I sort of know what everyone will suggest but it's definitely harder when you're the person in the situation. I don't use an iPhone. I have an iPad Air I use for some stuff and can pay and access the balance from there, but I'm not able to actually use the card unless I have the physical card with me since its primarily used through Apple pay. That said, I don't check it often. 

I knew the balance was maxed when she broke up with me so I let it go and told her ultimately I opened the card so I'd clear the balance and I took out a loan from my credit union for the $11,000 and paid it off in May. I didn't close it because I got her verbal commitment to set a $1000 limit to the card and use it only for emergency expenses because although she broke up with me and moved out, she told me it was so we could work on ourselves and try dating again after a few months. The balance is now almost $5,000 only 45 days after I took out that loan.

Am I the asshole if I close it and not give her any option to negotiate with me to keep it open? If she permanently stops speaking to me over this, is it really on me? I feel the answers in my chest but it's easier giving advice than acting on things yourself, help me out please.

Daughter is in her mid 20s and son is in late 20s. My son has a stable job and daughter despite being computer science BTech has not managed to hold stable jobs. My son will be marrying soon and has already found a girl and my daughter is unmarried. First job she got fired then second one she was laid off and then third one was with a call center and she did not like it as they were cheating their clients and quit.

To help her, I spoke to an immigration agent to help her move to Canada and get a job. The agent organised everything, from work to accommodation, airport pickup, everything and I paid for it. The only thing is for visa purposes, she had to go as a student and enroll in a college and take some simple diploma courses.

She went and has been there for almost one year now, however she has not liked it that much and complained a lot. Her main issue is the accommodation because she has no bedroom of her own and lives with 11 other people. She is complaining about little thinks like finding a place to change etc because most of the others are men and she does not feel safe, although they are Indian only and I have spoken to them on whatsapp video call sometimes and they seem nice. There is also one other women.

She also complains because she has to do many jobs that are cash pay because of student visa but all this is organized by the agent and they are not related to her degree and tend to me service / cleaning jobs.

She cannot take her own place as the rent is very expensive. Recently we got in argument because she was talking about finding another place or coming back. I told her I cannot support that as I have invested a lot in her for her education and sending her to Canada. She has not yet sent me back sufficient money to cover what I want her to help us with. I need to build an extension to our house in India as when my son marries, he and his wife can live in that extended unit. In India this is typically the norm in my region that the bride goes home to the sons family.

Also this is in her own best interest, the agent will help her transition her visa to stay in Canada after she finishes the diploma course and then she should be free to seek other jobs that interest her. But she does not understand that to have good things you need to struggle a bit.

",Asshole,2024-06-15,"AITA for sending my daughter to work abroad and telling her I will not support her if she comes back too soon. I live in India and have 2 kids. Daughter is in her mid 20s and son is in late 20s. My son has a stable job and daughter despite being computer science BTech has not managed to hold stable jobs. My son will be marrying soon and has already found a girl and my daughter is unmarried. First job she got fired then second one she was laid off and then third one was with a call center and she did not like it as they were cheating their clients and quit.

To help her, I spoke to an immigration agent to help her move to Canada and get a job. The agent organised everything, from work to accommodation, airport pickup, everything and I paid for it. The only thing is for visa purposes, she had to go as a student and enroll in a college and take some simple diploma courses.

I love him very much and I truly believe he is the one for me. He always makes me feel appreciated, prioritise me and have been my biggest supporter throughout the years. I have met his family and they have been very loving and welcoming.

The reason why I have kept this from my parents is because there are a few requirements they expect before approving this man to date their daughter:

1. Social economic status - he has a college degree and is currently working for a chain restaurant with hopes to take over the business one day. In my parents eyes, any potential son in law must have a university degree. (This is not a requirement for me personally because I see that he has a job and is not a bum that laze around all day.)

2. Religion - I come from a religious Christian family. My boyfriend is a non believer, and I don't mind this either. But it is an important requirement to my family.

There are a few more reasons which are a bit personal, but these are the main two reasons.

My boyfriend is understanding (his family too) and he does not want my family to cause me stress so he is okay with this. But there will come a time when we will take the next step in our relationship, and my family will have to know about this.

AITA for keeping this secret for so long? When they do find out, it may be a few years from now. But I am keeping this secret to keep the peace and not cause my all parties stress and conflict.

25,1dgthcc,AITA for not forcing my daughter to share her PS account with her brother?,"I (34f) am a divorced mother. I have 2 kids. Not using their real names for privacy reasons, but they are Luna (9f) and Leo (12m). 

In this house, we don‚Äôt have much assigned chores. (Do not comment to give more chores, I will be ignoring those. These are my rules) It‚Äôs pretty simple. 

If you make a mess clean it, pick up your own stuff and your stuff only. You are not obligated to clean everything because it‚Äôs there, my kids are not my maids. They just have to clean their own spaces and messes. I do ask for help sometimes and they both give. We all have healthy relationships. They can do things inngs outside for money, to teach them that money isn‚Äôt free and that their work pays off.

I got a playstation 4 for my kids, they are both well behaved. I don‚Äôt limit their time extremely, I just make sure they do take breaks for their health. Luna does extra things, like outdoor pickup, for some extra cash because she wants to. With that, she asked to get the playstation online. I bought it for her, she is very grateful and plays online regularly.

Leo also has an account, not an account he can play online though. He does not do the extra things, it is his choice. Recently, Luna has noticed she has more friends she did not add and achievements for Leo‚Äôs games. She asked him, and he said he does play on her account online. She told him he does not want him on her account, he said okay and it seemed fine. 

Since he does not have online, he uses the weekends for free PS+ to play online. During those, Luna lets him have the playstation the whole weekend as she feels it is fair for him to have a turn too.

Recently, Luna came to me and said Leo has been playing on her account even though she asked him to stop. I went and sure enough, Leo was on the PS4 on her account. I told him to close out of the game and go to his account. He was upset and complained he wants to play online too, outside of those weekends. I told him he can get online if he helps Luna with outdoor pickup. He said he does not want to. 

Fast forward to yesterday, Leo came to me and said Luna put a password on her account and won‚Äôt let him in. I asked what the issue was, that it‚Äôs her account and she worked for her money, and that she doesn‚Äôt have to let him go off of it. My sister was over during that and gave me a weird look and said that it isn‚Äôt a big deal, and PS+ isn‚Äôt much. 

I feel like if I got Leo PS+ for free, it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to Luna because she works for hers.

27,1dgtcsp,AITA for going to my daughter‚Äôs graduation after my son relapsed?,"My (M51) wife (F48) and I have two children: Jake (M23) and Jess (F18). 

Although they had the same upbringing, Jake sadly surrounding himself with the wrong people during his late teenage years and made some bad life decisions. Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements.

This has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally. 

Jake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months. Jess' graduation was the other day, and my wife and I had tickets and couldn't wait. She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her. 

However, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration.

My wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment. 

My wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment. This went on for a while, and I ended up sleeping on the couch. 

I still feel I made the right decision, but I know I hurt my wife, and Jake's recovery is obviously of paramount importance as well.

He came back to me asking how I expected him to make a living. 

We had both talked to him about getting a degree that had more prospects and maybe doing a minor in dance. Our daughter who is a doctor did her undergrad in music. But she also took premed classes and rocked her MCAT. 

He says that he didn't want to do that. He wants me to tell him what to do. I am just kind of lost. So I told him it's a good thing he's pretty.

30,1dgsrdu,AITA for crying and not wanting to go on a family vacation ,"I've never posted on here but I am in a shitty situation and i dont know what to do. 

So, I'm an 18yo female (recently turned) and i live with my mum (46), stephdad (67) and my autistic halfbrother (16) and halfsister (12) most of the time (the autistic part is relevant). My dad (49) and my stephmum live further, so i rarely see them because i don't have my drivers license yet. I'm my dad's only child and at my mums I'm the oldest. I've been raised by my mum to shut up and listen and never backtalk which is why its very hard for me to do anything other than that now.
Anyhow, a while ago my mum started talking about a mandatory family vacation for summer, but I really don't want to go. Every time we go on a family vacation it just ends up shit because they always fight and my stephdad is borderline abusive. He always directs his anger at my brother and my sister is the typical youngest who can't ever do anything wrong, so my brother gets the blame. Then he just yells back at stephdad, mum is in a bad mood and Sis is being entitled. Brother and sister are also always bickering, and even when they're just having honest fun stephdad has to yell at my brother to 'leave her alone'. I'm just always inbetween there like a fucking babysitting referee and I've mentioned I do not want to go on family vacations anymore multiple times, especially this one.
Well today, mum called me to her because she wanted to start booking so i sat next to her and i guess a certain moment i just started crying because when she looked at me again she just lost it. She sarcastically said 'Well i see how excited you are' and then went on and on about how 'yk what it's my fault i should have known my oldest doesn't like her family anymore' (i havent for a long time btw). So now she said 'you know what stay at home go to your dads i dont give a shit do what you want, i'd rather go to vacation without a mood killer anyways'. I tried to explain my point as calmly as i could between tears but she just left to work. I hope she was serious about me not having to go but the risk is that my brother will now also be difficult because I am not going, which could make them stay and then I won't have rest either way.

31,1dgsp09,AITA for reporting my neighbors noisy house party?,"I (27F) live in a small apartment complex where most residents are generally respectful and keep noise levels down. Recently, my next-door neighbors (late 20s M/F) have been throwing frequent parties that go well into the early hours of the morning. I'm usually tolerant and understanding, but this particular night, the noise was unbearable‚Äîit was past midnight, and the bass was shaking my walls.

After trying to ignore it for a while, I finally decided to call our building manager to complain. It took a while for someone to answer, but when they did, I explained the situation and asked if they could intervene. The manager assured me they would handle it.

Sure enough, within about 30 minutes, the noise started to die down. I was finally able to get some sleep, but the next morning, I noticed my neighbors glaring at me as I left my apartment. Later that day, the guy from next door approached me in the hallway.

He asked if I was the one who called the manager on them. I admitted that I did, explaining politely that the noise was just too much for me to handle, especially late at night. He seemed really annoyed and said it was just a birthday celebration for his girlfriend, and they didn't mean to disturb anyone.

I felt a bit guilty hearing that, but I also didn't think it justified keeping the entire building awake. He didn't seem satisfied with my explanation and walked away looking upset. Since then, there's been a noticeable tension whenever we see each other.

Now I'm wondering if I overreacted. I know it was late and noise ordinances are there for a reason, but was it really worth potentially souring relations with my neighbors? AITA for reporting them, or should I have handled it differently?

32,1dgs7mg,AITA for sharing personal information about my now ex best-friend?,"Around a month ago my best friend suddenly began ghosting or ignoring my messages, we had always agreed upon prioritising communication, so I knew something was really wrong when I'd ask if something was wrong and she'd ignore it. Eventually she just told me she wanted space from me, so I gave her it. 

A few days later she then explained that there had been a lot going on and she just needed time away from me to focus on herself, which is of course understandable, but it concerned me that she hadn't said this to any of our other friends. The next message I received was her explaining that she'd been told I'd been talking shit about her behind her back, this confused me greatly as many of my friends who didn't even know her would hear me drone on about how much I loved this girl and was grateful to have her in my life. 

I explained how I highly, highly doubted this was true, as I would have remembered going out of my way to purposefully put her down in front of others. Plus, even now I can't think of anything negative that I would have said about her. But she refused to tell me what she had actually heard, and eventually I was asked to give her more time, so we went another couple of weeks with no contact. 

This explanation then adapted to how I had shared something personal about her with someone else. I racked my brain for hours but still couldn't think of what this thing had been. When we have deep conversations that we don't want sharing we always make sure that we keep it confidential at the end of the talk, and I couldn't think of anything she'd told me that I'd then told someone else. The reaction from her applied to me that this must have been something very serious, and it's strange to me that I can't remember this as I would have felt so guilty after, but perhaps that is part of the problem, that I didn't take it seriously enough what she had told me. 

I never got an answer to what it was I shared, so all I can say on this post is that it was personal. I can't imagine why I would have done this, if anything it wasn't intentionally harmful or malicious as I would have remebered betraying any friend in this way. I do have suspicions of another shared friend that she got incredibly close with after this, and who made her jealousy over our friendship and closeness very obvious. Whether this other friend made something up, or whether my ex bsf made something up as an excuse I don't know. But assuming that she is being honest and this actually happened. I need to know from others know their thoughts on my actions, so that I can learn from this and eventually forgive myself and the situation, before then I don't think I'll be able to find closure. 

So please be as honest as possible, I need this to move on from her.

39,1dgq93c,WIBTA If I asked my roommate to find another place? ,"WIBTA if I asked my roommate to find another place?

I‚Äôve posted in a diff sub about this situation and was told i had too many rules, but i believe this is reasonable when sharing a living space with someone. Our ages are: Me (20F), my husband (21M) and my roommate (24F)
I have a roommate that‚Äôs renting out a room for $650/month. This is in the PNW so rent out here is not cheap. I have 4 reasons why I want to ask her to look for another place: 
The 1st is that we asked her to not do any drugs in our home because my husband cannot be around them whatsoever (he is military), we told her we don‚Äôt care if she does do drugs, just not do them at home. We came home and the house smelled like weed, and we asked her about it and she admitted to smoking inside the house but it was just a dab pen. We told her we know it wasn‚Äôt a dab pen and asked her not to do it again or we would have to ask her to move out, she didn‚Äôt do it again, okay great! 
The second is that she has only been living with us for 5 months and recently threw out 2 50gal industrial sized trash bags from her room and it was all garbage. Now idk how or why this happens but it was kinda.. I helped her take it out and everything but it rubbed me the wrong way. I grew up with a mom who cleaned houses for a living so i know what built up trash does to a home. 
The third kind of ties into the trash thing. She had about 10 little to medium sized boxes in her room and she set them in our entry way (6‚ÄôLx2‚ÄôW) and said she would take them out the next morning. This was on Tues, it‚Äôs now Sat. I understand procrastination but in a shared living space like an entry way i feel like it‚Äôs kind of necessary to keep it tidy. 
The fourth and final thing that really irked me was that I came home Thurs and Fri to a complete stranger in my house. This was the guy she‚Äôs been talking to for about 2-3 weeks. It was just her and i with a grown man in the home. Now idk if it‚Äôs just because i watch too many true crime shows but that isn‚Äôt really a situation i‚Äôm comfy with!!! We also only have one exit and entry point so it‚Äôs def not a good situation if things went south. This may just be paranoia but as a woman i feel like it‚Äôs reasonable. 
In my recent post in a different sub i wrote that i was mostly upset about the fact that she didn‚Äôt text me about it to give me a heads up. Now i do admit that i did write ‚Äúlike a day before or the morning of‚Äù which does sound kind of like parenting but i would have appreciated at least a couple hours in advance! We always text her ‚Äúhey i‚Äôm planning on having a couple friends over tonight/tomorrow/a couple days from now‚Äù in case she wants to be involved or just wants to be left alone. So it‚Äôs not like all of these ‚Äúrules‚Äù are just for her, we follow these rules out of common courtesy for her and each other. 
I also admit that I do have a couple pew pews in my room that aren‚Äôt locked up and because of my recent post to that sub that i should lock up.

42,1dgq2a0,AITA for hanging with my ex's former best friend?,"I (23M) recently went through a breakup with a girl (29F) about a month and a half ago.  We dated for 6 months. We're both regulars at a local bar/music venue, and were friends prior to dating. I really saw a future with this girl. I was basically living at her apartment, and I eventually wanted her to meet my children. Shortly after we started dating, she stopped being friends with one of her best friends (22F). I knew 22F, and was not a fan of her at all. This was a difficult time for my ex, and I was there to help her through it. Another close friend started to date 22F,  and I would call him regularly, telling him to avoid her at all costs, based on her treatment of my ex, as well as other behaviors I had noticed. My ex and 22F have not spoken since January of this year.

I was very upset for awhile after my ex broke up with me. At the beginning and the end of the relationship, we had thoroughly discussed how we were certain we would remain friends if we ever broke up, and that the respect we had for one another was real.  After the breakup, we hung out at the bar several times, and were getting along great as friends. The last time we hung out, I went to her apartment and picked up a few things, and we had fun catching up and laughing.

A few days later, I saw her briefly as she was leaving the bar, and she reminded me of the $700 I owe her. Money has been tight, as I have hardly been working, and I told her it would take some time before I could pay her. She told me she understood, and that I could break it down into smaller chunks, and there was no rush. I was very flustered and surprised by this conversation, as I had forgotten about the debt. I was admittedly very drunk during that conversation, and continued to drink heavily for the rest of the night.

After my ex left the bar, her former best friend, 22F walked in and struck up a conversation. Eventually, one thing led to another, and I went home with 22F to her apartment. We have since been hanging out nonstop. Since my ex and I split, I have been living at my parents house, but 22F has said I can stay with her whenever I want. I have been enjoying her company thoroughly.

My ex found out about this, and she is very upset. When I have seen her at the bar since she found out, she will not talk to me, and instead basically laughs at my face or ignores me completely. She has since started to send me individual venmo requests for all of the times she gave me money, with the dates and descriptions. Now she is sending reminders through Venmo every other day.

While I appreciated my ex girlfriend a lot, and did hope to be friends with her post-breakup, I feel like since she broke up with me, she can‚Äôt be mad at me for who I hang out with now. I really didn‚Äôt like 22F before, but my opinion has changed since I have gotten to know her more intimately.

44,1dgpy44,AITA for going to a party without my girlfriend?,"I am a student about to leave my last year of school. For a while me and my friends have been planning a party for a while for when we leave and now it's finally about to happen next week. My and my girlfriend were going to go together, however she got uninvited - let me explain. My girlfriend is in the year (/grade) below me, which means she isn't leaving school. My friends say that because it's technically a leavers party, it should just be for us to enjoy. I tried to disagree and say it shouldn't matter because I knew my girlfriend was really looking forward to it, and I really wanted her there, but no avail, I was outvoted. 

However, now my girlfriend is telling me I shouldn't go either - she says ""they're not your real friends anyway"" and ""I hate most of them"". When she was still going, she was really excited to go and now that she's not, she's acting like it's a completely different party. But there's more...

She says she'll do activities we'd planned to do together, with other people and leave me out to spite me. She's telling me she isn't my number one priority and that if I loved her I wouldn't go. But wait. There's more. My girlfriend is bisexual and says that she'll have a sleepover with the girl she had a crush on saying she'll happily snog her completely sober - blatantly threatening to cheat on me. BUT WAIT... there's more. She says she's been hurting herself lately (I know it's a sensitive topic) thinking about the idea of me going without her and tells me I'M the reason she's flunking her end of year's (mocks/finals). 

I feel like she's being unfair. After a long 5 years at school I feel as though I deserve a few hours for one night with my friends because half of them leave for another college of which I see as often or even ever again. I feel like I'm being manipulated to not go. I came to the conclusion that I'm going to the party anyway and when I tried to make her understand, she yelled at me and hung up without saying the usual ""I love you"". I don't feel like I'm asking for much, but I understand she was also uninvited from the party by simply being a year below so I also see her point of view.

I tried to disagree and say it shouldn't matter because I knew my girlfriend was really looking forward to it, and I really wanted her there, but no avail, I was outvoted. 

However, now my girlfriend is telling me I shouldn't go either - she says ""they're not your real friends anyway"" and ""I hate most of them"". When she was still going, she was really excited to go and now that she's not, she's acting like it's a completely different party. But there's more...

She says she'll do activities we'd planned to do together, with other people and leave me out to spite me. She's telling me she isn't my number one priority and that if I loved her I wouldn't go. But wait. There's more. My girlfriend is bisexual and says that she'll have a sleepover with the girl she had a crush on saying she'll happily snog her completely sober - blatantly threatening to cheat on me. BUT WAIT... there's more. She says she's been hurting herself lately (I know it's a sensitive topic) thinking about the idea of me going without her and tells me I'M the reason she's flunking her end of year's (mocks/finals). 

I feel like she's being unfair. After a long 5 years at school I feel as though I deserve a few hours for one night with my friends because half of them leave for another college of which I see as often or even ever again. I feel like I'm being manipulated to not go. I came to the conclusion that I'm going to the party anyway and when I tried to make her understand, she yelled at me and hung up without saying the usual ""I love you"". I don't feel like I'm asking for much, but I understand she was also uninvited from the party by simply being a year below so I also see her point of view. That begs the question - am I the asshole for going to this party even though she doesn't want me to?",0.0,0.05954016000032425,0,1
45,1dgpmyp,AITA for throwing away my roommate's food because I didn't like the smell?,"I (25M) share an apartment with my roommate, Dave (24M). We've been living together for about a year, and generally, things have been fine. We get along well, split the chores, and respect each other's space. Recently, though, we've hit a rough patch.

Dave has recently gotten really into cooking, which I initially thought was awesome because it meant I didn't have to cook as much. However, he's been making a lot of dishes with strong spices and ingredients that I don't particularly like. Specifically, he's been making a lot of curry and other heavily spiced foods that leave a lingering smell in the apartment.

At first, I didn't mind too much. I thought it was great that Dave was exploring new recipes and enjoying his hobby. But as time went on, the smell became more and more overwhelming. Even after he finished cooking, the scent of curry would linger for hours, sometimes even into the next day. It got to the point where I felt like I couldn't escape it, and it was starting to make me lose my appetite and feel uncomfortable in my own home.

I approached Dave about it a couple of times, asking if he could maybe cook something else or at least use less of the strong spices. I tried to be polite and understanding, explaining that the smell was really bothering me. Dave listened, but he said that this is what he enjoys eating and cooking, and he didn't want to change his diet. He suggested that I could open a window or use an air freshener if the smell was that bad.

Two days ago, I came home from work and the whole apartment smelled like curry again. I was already having a bad day, and walking into that strong smell was the last straw. I was really frustrated and, in the heat of the moment, I decided to throw away all of Dave's curry from the fridge. I thought this would be a good way to make the point that the smell was a real issue for me and that I needed him to take it seriously.

When Dave came home and found out, he was understandably furious. He said I had no right to throw away his food and that it was incredibly wasteful and disrespectful. He pointed out that he had spent a lot of time and money on the ingredients, and now he had nothing to eat for the week. I could see how upset he was, and I immediately felt guilty. I apologized and offered to pay for the ingredients, but Dave is still really angry and has been avoiding me since.

I've tried talking to him a few times, but he's been giving me the cold shoulder. Some of my friends think I overstepped, while others agree that Dave should have been more considerate of the shared living space. I understand that I acted out of frustration, but I also feel like Dave wasn't considering how his cooking was affecting me.",Asshole,2024-06-15,"AITA for throwing away my roommate's food because I didn't like the smell?

46,1dgpksa,WIBTA If I accepted a house bequeathed to me by a friend over his children?,"I (33M) have recently been bequeated a house near Austin, Texas, by a much older friend (M67) of mine. This surprised me more than a little since, while we always got along famously (we share multiple interests and go to the same church), I didnt think we were THAT close, and was expecting all of his key assets to go to his wife and adult children.

My friend was from the US and has three adult children and a spouse. His youngest daughter (19F) and spouse (50s), based in Thailand, are already benificiaries of his main assets, mainly financial investments worth slightly over USD 10 million held in trust, of which my father and I are trustees. He, however, has left his two adult children, a son (35M) and daughter (approx 30F) by previous marriage only token bequeathments.

These two older children are very unhappy about the situation, and does not accept the will. While I knew that my friend had estranged adult children (something about political and lifestyle differences, I do not know the details) by a previous marriage, I have never seen the elder two children, either visiting my friend at his retirement residence in Thailand or our two joint holiday in the US. The financial health of the two siblings seems to be rather bad; neither of them own a house yet, and the younger daughter also has a certain amount of debt. I do sympathise with their situation; to bequeath a house to a friend over the head of one's children (even estranged ones) would be seen as extraordinary here in Thailand.

I am considering the following options:

1. Accept the house as bequeathed to me by my friend, and either selling it or renting it out.
2. Decline the bequeathment in favour of my friend's adult children.
3. Accept the house, but sell the property and donate the proceeds minus tax and fees to charities which would have been approved by my friend (our mutual church, red cross etc).

His Thailand based wife and daughter had already indicated they consent to me taking any of the above choices.

Additional information:

A consultation with a US based law firm is of the opinion that we have basically zero chance of losing this case if it comes to court, as the will was witnessed by several of my friend's ex colleagues of good repute, and retained a lucid (I would say brilliant) mind right up to his death.

The house is located in an Austin suburb, and is woth approximately USD 1,800,000

My financial position is reasonably well off, though to be very blunt accepting a USD 2 million house will add more than a few percent to my net wealth also.

So I 20f started dating Josh 19m 6 months ago. We have a lot in common and we have a lot of mutual friends. I started dating Josh after we met while he was working at KFC. He gave me a free meal and since then when have spent basically everyday together.

Everything was good from my point of view until 2 months ago. When we would order food he would always forget my order or just order what he wanted. This got really annoying especially when I would ask him to order me something dairy free and he would get dairy anyway meaning I couldn't eat it.

I remember we ordered a Pizza and were watching Netflix at my dorm. I asked him to get me a pizza without cheese. He got a plain cheese Pizza.

I called him out on it and we got into a fight. He called me ungrateful and then tried to say he forgot. I asked if he had been to the doctor about it since that's a basic thing to be forgetting and he got mad at me and called me a dumb b.

Since then I started testing him. I would ask for the most basic things. Plain salad no dressing, carrot sticks, plain rice etc. He would get it wrong every single time. So finally a month ago I started asking him to get me water. just plain water.

He forgot. I finally had enough. I told him it's over since he can't even get water right. He started blowing up my phone calling me selfish and a hoe. He accused me of sleeping with his friends and of only dating him for food.

Now my sister Kaylyn 23f is saying I should pay him back for all the stuff he bought me during the relationship. I told her I would if I had been able to eat any of it.

Both were supposed to happen during June, as we left school early this year because of graduation (normally we have school until the end of June, but we were finished the first June week this year).

We both agreed to have this month to just chill with each other and friends and rest before starting work for the rest of the summer. 

We were supposed to go a trip with friends which will last 5 days. We planned and agreed on this in December of last year (2023) and booked everything as well. We also agreed with transport management, where there would be 2 cars, me and another friend, taking everyone. I am pretty good driver but I lack confidence when driving, esp. to new places through roads I haven't driven on before. So I need someone in the car with me, which was supposed to be my BF. On our drive we would pick up a few other friends as well.

Another trip was supposed to be just the two of us, for 2-3 days. Just to get to spend some alone time together, with a bit of a change of scenery as well.

Well all plans flew out the window when my BF got a job starting right after graduation. At first he was trying to convince me that he will still be able to go on both trips. Then he cancelled our holiday for just the two of us, but he kept convincing me that he will be able to take the other trip. Well then he cancelled the trip with friends as well. He did not cancel completely tho, he is going to be able to come for the 1st and 2nd day, and he will have to leave literally at noon on day 2. And because of this we had to change the car arrangement as well as several activities that requiered having two cars to take everyone to the place where the activity would be (like hikes, sightseeing etc.)

This made me very upset as in September I am starting college 300+km away from the city where he lives, and we also live about 150km away from each other as is. Since I am starting to work next month I won't have much time to spend with him as well, and I was very excited to spend time together during June. He promised me that we would spend this time together, and it honestly scares me that if can't find the time to spend with me rn, what will happen when I'll study 300km away from him. 

But I feel I am in the wrong for getting mad at him for this, because he isn't really the one who got him the job, his dad is.

50,1dgp7uj,AITA For Not Cleaning Out My Boyfriend's Dog's Cage?,"Backstory: My boyfriend and I have been living together for a year. We have 3 dogs (2 out of 3 for mine and I take sole responsibility and care for them). I also do a majority of the chores around the house. His only major chore (other than the dog) is taking out the trash, of which he requests that I have it tied up and by the door so it's easier for him to get it. I wasn't too crazy about the idea of getting a 3rd dog, but he kept saying how he'd always wanted his own dog and how much he wanted a relationship like I have with my dogs, so I caved. We got his dog back in December. 

Before we got his dog, I sat down and had a serious conversation with him about responsibilities. I told him that this was HIS dog and he was responsible for it the same way I'm responsible for my dogs. He agreed, albeit with a bit of an attitude, but I didn't mind it too much.

I WFH 4 days a week, but have 2 jobs so I am usually quit busy. He works around 20 minutes away from our home, but is home on Thursdays and Fridays all day. Because I am home more often than him, I agreed to talk all 3 dogs out on their daily walks until he gets home from work (12pm, 3pm, and 5pm just for his dog). He is supposed to be responsible for her walk before bedtime. If the dog is not taken out before bed, sometimes she will have an accident in the cage. I used to clean this up a lot since he gets a bit squeamish with dog crap, but it got to the point where, if she has an accident, he expects me to help. This was never something I fully agreed to; I just felt bad for sitting around and watching him clean it up.

Recently, I've tried to put my foot down about cleaning out the cage. He doesn't always feel like taking her out when he gets home from work, so sometimes she'll have accidents. A few nights ago, she had an accident in the cage that I noticed first. I mentioned it to him before I took my dogs out. After I came home , I noticed her soiled blanket was thrown lazily next to her cage. There was still some mess on the inside that was clearly visible. I didn't want to nag him, so I didn't bring it up, hoping he left the blanket there because he was going to come back for it later. That night, I brought him a new blanket for her and let him know, as nicely as I could, that he needed to make sure her cage was clean before he put the blanket in or it would stink. He said the cage was clean and put the new blanket in. I could still see the dog crap in the cage but I really didn't want to start an argument, and I knew if I kept pushing, it would lead to one, so I kept my mouth shut and went to bed.

The next morning, I mentioned it again, and he got upset and said why I didn't just clean it if I knew it was still dirty. I said because it was his responsibly and the poop was very clearly still on the cage, and that if he didn't just half-ass clean it in the first place, he would've seen it too.

I WFH 4 days a week, but have 2 jobs so I am usually quit busy. He works around 20 minutes away from our home, but is home on Thursdays and Fridays all day. Because I am home more often than him, I agreed to talk all 3 dogs out on their daily walks until he gets home from work (12pm, 3pm, and 5pm just for his dog). He is supposed to be responsible for her walk before bedtime. If the dog is not taken out before bed, sometimes she will have an accident in the cage. I used to clean this up a lot since he gets a bit squeamish with dog crap, but it got to the point where, if she has an accident, he expects me to help. This was never something I fully agreed to; I just felt bad for sitting around and watching him clean it up.

Recently, I've tried to put my foot down about cleaning out the cage. He doesn't always feel like taking her out when he gets home from work, so sometimes she'll have accidents. A few nights ago, she had an accident in the cage that I noticed first. I mentioned it to him before I took my dogs out. After I came home , I noticed her soiled blanket was thrown lazily next to her cage. There was still some mess on the inside that was clearly visible. I didn't want to nag him, so I didn't bring it up, hoping he left the blanket there because he was going to come back for it later. That night, I brought him a new blanket for her and let him know, as nicely as I could, that he needed to make sure her cage was clean before he put the blanket in or it would stink. He said the cage was clean and put the new blanket in. I could still see the dog crap in the cage but I really didn't want to start an argument, and I knew if I kept pushing, it would lead to one, so I kept my mouth shut and went to bed.

The next morning, I mentioned it again, and he got upset and said why I didn't just clean it if I knew it was still dirty. I said because it was his responsibly and the poop was very clearly still on the cage, and that if he didn't just half-ass clean it in the first place, he would've seen it too. So that's where we're at. ",3.0,0.0620083212852478,0,0
51,1dgp671,AITAH for calling out a friend in public,"I have a friend and classmate that I often feel makes questionable decisions regarding my child. He‚Äôs done a couple things in the past that haven‚Äôt been a huge deal, basically just calling him fat or pantsing him at a party (he‚Äôs 19 months). Usually I just move past it but this time I couldn‚Äôt.

We were at a class event and we were playing spikeball with a group of friends and my kid was a good 20-30 feet from the net with my wife watching him. The ball went behind him and in turn behind my kid that was standing a ways back. The point had already been scored and the ball out of play. Rather than walking or running around my kid he decided to hurdle my one and a half year old unnecessarily. It bothered me because realistically one slip or misstep and he could‚Äôve seriously injured my kid. If the ball had been in play, or if it was an attempt to not injure my kid, I would‚Äôve understood more, but I felt like in the situation it was uncalled for.

As he walked back I told him ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that if you don‚Äôt need to‚Äù he responded I didn‚Äôt need to and laughed. I repeated, ‚ÄúI know, don‚Äôt do that if you don‚Äôt need to‚Äù to which he responded ‚Äúyeah, don‚Äôt tell me that again‚Äù and started to roll his eyes and laugh to the rest of the group present. He began to tell them that he‚Äôs fine and‚Ä¶ I jumped in, at this point all respect and politeness were gone and I was raising my voice, saying shut up you‚Äôre putting my kid at risk for no reason. Then I said I‚Äôm done, quit playing, threw the ball to him, and started getting my kid‚Äôs diaper bag and told my wife we were going to leave rather than stay there. 

Another friend playing approached me, shook my hand and said hey I get where you‚Äôre coming from. 
I responded, ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm just not gonna deal with that crap.‚Äù

The first friend that jumped over my kid came back and (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting some word for word stuff) said:

Me ‚ÄúI already am leaving, I‚Äôve obviously already grabbed all my stuff‚Äù

Other stuff was said but I can‚Äôt remember everyone word for word.

Once we got home I texted the group (other than the culprit) and apologized for making the situation so uncomfortable.

i love him a lot, and he does think my intentions are bad with the way i wont take a picture with him, but i really just barely take pictures of myself at all and really hate taking them, and i feel like tik tok is especially different because the stuff i post has nothing to do with my looks. im talking about stuff im interested in in all of them. am i the asshole? do i suck it up and just take a picture?

I'm in the stage of buying furniture and stuff for my new place. My dad (44M) is a very controlling guy imo and always wants to be involved in everything and make decisions for everybody. Our relationship has always been pretty frayed cause of this. 

At the start of this process he kept talking about furniture, insisted on coming with me to open houses, led conversations with the letting agents and that sorta thing. We had an argument because he insisted that I have to buy my own pots/ pans etc because using what came with the house even after cleaning them would be gross, so I bought my own. 

 I told him I didn't want him to buy *any* furniture for the place, and that I wanted to pick out and buy the furniture. Last night, I told him I was going to the warehouse store today to look at furniture, specifically a coffee table.  I found one I like and want for my place. 

When I came home, he had bought me a coffee table. Admittedly it's  way cheaper than the one I want, but it looks like crap and isn't anything like I want. I reacted really badly and just shrugged, because inside I was so pissed he'd done this when I'd already said I didn't want him to do it. I told him I'd already picked some out and he'd have to return them. Turns out he glued some of the parts together when he put it together so he can't take them back to the store so he said I have to take it. I told him well then he could do whatever he wants with it but it's not going to my place. 

He came into my room just there and did a whole ""I'm sorry, I just thought I was doing good, I couldn't pass it up, it's a good deal and you need one,"" 

I told him that I know he wants to be involved in the move but that it has to be 100% on my terms. He said fine but has been acting upset and distant since. We were gonna go to the store together and grab some beers but told me not to bother coming. 

I think I might be TA because the table is bought now and would  be fine in my apartment, so I should just use it since it would save me a lot of money  - but I know he'd use me accepting it now as an excuse to never take my no seriously.

Now, I‚Äôm 18, on the verge of graduating and going off to college. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to, but my mom put the idea in my head that I need to in order to have a good future.

The other two are much past that stage, so I suppose it‚Äôs me. Which, I‚Äôm grateful for, but I don‚Äôt have a choice either way.

Back to how I said I was kinda spoiled, my parents never seemed to mind too much before, as we made good money.

Like as though every financial decision she made is somehow my fault, she‚Äôll use it in her lectures whenever I ask for anything, saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already got to buy all this for your grad party (or other thing).

As for prom, she decided on her own that we should stay at the expensive hotel my schools using as a venue for convenience, which was included in her lectures, as though that was my decision as well. Which, wasn‚Äôt. 

The other day, I found out that I‚Äôm allowed to decorate my grad cap. I told her about it, being that I‚Äôd need her to drive me to the store and I‚Äôd need $$ (she always told me not to get a job and to focus on school for the time being), and she gave me the lecture again.

Part of me feels I should just be grateful for everything I‚Äôm given and stop complaining, but the other side feels as though I‚Äôm being guilt tripped when most of these expenses are not decided by me, yet somehow are my fault and I‚Äôm shamed for it.

58,1dgo79h,AITA for telling my younger sister that I'm angry and I don't want to talk w/her?,"
For some context:
Me (26F), disabled and in college (late in life due to my disability), living with my dad 'cause my mom's also disabled and can't afford to support me. So, I live with my dad (54M), his wife (45F), and their three daughters (17, 9, and 8).
They don't cover any of my expenses and I contribute financially to the household. Lately, they've not been saving any food for me at all (they usually cook extra but now they're just making enough so I don't get any leftovers), so I've stopped helping out with household chores except the ones that concern me (washing my own dishes, feeding and keeping the pets clean, and cleaning the bathroom after I use it). Occasionally, I also do their laundry, hang it, and iron it.
Recently, the youngest got into my room and stole some of my makeup, giving it away at her school, which hurt me a lot 'cause I often buy them gifts (clothes, toys, candy, etc.) and help them with their homework. I told my SM and she talked to her, but at the end of the day, she said she didn't know if it was her or not, but she'd pay for the losses. Thing is, I don't care about the material stuff or the money; what bothers me is the betrayal, and I think at 8, a kid knows stealing is wrong. Even if she had taken them for herself, I would've forgiven her no problem.
No one told me what happened; they just swept it under the rug. My other sister recently told me the truth, and more than angry, I was really sad 'cause it felt like a straight-up betrayal and she already knows and understands these concepts.
I didn't show my anger or say anything, but the next day, she was trying to talk to me, and I just said, ""[Sister's name], I'm mad at you for what you did,"" and nothing more. I said it calmly, didn't raise my voice, and didn't curse.
That night, my SM confronted me and said what I did was out of line because she already dealt with it and I had no part in it. I told her I have the right to be mad and express it healthily and that at 8, she should learn actions have consequences. SM argued I have no part in raising her, but I think if she hurt me, she should at least apologize.

We both worked on our anniversary as it was on a wednesday so i was not expecting any special surprises but i was expecting to exchange gifts and have a dinner together that evening.

My mum's parents lives in a pretty remote place that is at least an hour away from us(and can't really receive any signal at all).

So, we won't visit them unless there is some kind of festival or holiday or birthday, which in a place where we celebrate both Chinese and western holidays, we basically visit them more than I can meet my friends.

I have a bunch of reasons of why I hate to go. But the most important one is, I hate the sound of mahjong. But my grandparents and my mum love to to play mahjong, so everytime their sons and daughters(they have more than one) visit them, they play mahjong. My mum always get there earlier just to do that and as we only have one car, when she goes, all of us have to go too. That actually turned to getting my dad to drive her there first and picking us up later...but that's not the point.

I have expressed my hate of them playing mahjong and asked her just to leave me alone in the house so many times to a point where my mum and I HAD an agreement that I would only visit them if they don't play mahjong. But of course after like 2 or 3 times, my mum just didn't care about the agreement...as expected. I am bad at arguing with people(especially those aggressive people like my mum and my elder sister) so I just ghost them all whenever it was time to go visit my grandparents. And everytime they come back from it(like near midnight), my mum would scold me for being unfilial for not visiting them. I understand my grandparents are old and not in their best health, and that's probably the only valid reason on my mum's side.

She looks at me and says ‚Äúare those my shorts?‚Äù I simply respond with ‚Äúyeah they were in the trash‚Äù she goes ‚Äúin the trash? Well they‚Äôre mine. I just got those.‚Äù I say ‚Äúwell they were in the trash and I didn‚Äôt know u just got them.‚Äù She goes ‚Äúyeah well give them back they‚Äôre mine‚Äù and she angrily asked ‚Äúwhy are u always wearing my stuff?‚Äù I simply said ‚Äúthey were in the trash so I thought you didn‚Äôt want them tf‚Äù and then went to my room. I decided to take the shorts off and go wash the entire bag of clothes I had taken out of the garbage so I could give her everything back bc I was so pissed off. Like I understand they‚Äôre your shorts but she was the one who threw them out? She kept saying she didn‚Äôt go through the bags she threw out but once again that‚Äôs her fault. How was I supposed to know she didn‚Äôt mean to throw out the clothes I got in the trash? Later on, I go to the washing machine so I can go and dry the clothes and my sister decides to come tell me ‚Äúdw about the shorts, I was just tripping.‚Äù I was obviously pissed off bc she literally made a whole scene about the shorts and I said ‚Äúdw im giving you all the clothes I got from the trash back.‚Äù She literally LAUGHS straight in my face and gives me a side eye which once again pissed me even more off. I decide to just storm off to my room and she said something but I didn‚Äôt hear what she said and idc either. I‚Äôm just pissed off bc she‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs my fault that she threw all her clothes out and like I stole everything that I got.

65,1dgn1jj,AITA for telling my mom it‚Äôs me or the dog?,"I am currently 6 months pregnant and living with my mom due to a housing debate with my boyfriend. I was helping pay bills up until I got pregnant and my mom stopped asking me to help so I would be able to save money for the baby. For the past year or so I have been the only one to clean the house throughly. She does do the occasional sweep, however I am the only one who mops cleans the bathrooms etc. I tend to do the dishes and my grandmother will do them if she comes over and sees any in the sink. I still buy groceries and take care of the dogs during the day while she works and she watches them over night while I work.

We have 5 dogs, four of them are hers and one is mine. The oldest of the five is an 18 year old blind deaf and partially paralyzed weenie dog. He wears a wrap diaper to keep him from peeing all over the house. We have a doggy door but he has stopped using it since he can‚Äôt jump anymore. He doesn‚Äôt wine or stalk the door when he needs to go #2 he just walks and poops. This makes it fairly difficult to tell when he needs to go outside. I try to put him outside regularly though the day, but since he can‚Äôt navigate he just stands right outside the door and barks, I let him back in and he poops inside. I have told my mom maybe it‚Äôs time to put him out of his misery, he‚Äôs been paralyzed three different times and seems to bounce back. While he does get zoomies around the house every now and then he crashes into walls and barks at chairs. She has suggested in the past that we put him in a kennel with a cushion and puppy pad so he is confined to one space. However now that I‚Äôm suggesting we try to actually implement that she says it‚Äôs inhumane to have him in a kennel all day. 

I‚Äôm getting too pregnant to keep cleaning and changing a senile dog when I‚Äôm going to have my own baby to clean up after. I‚Äôve told her I‚Äôm done, since I can‚Äôt go one day with a clean floor without him pooping all over the place. It‚Äôs unsanitary and it‚Äôs not going to be clean for the baby. It‚Äôs me or the dog. She said I was AH for telling her to kill her dog and I‚Äôm just having crazy pregnancy hormones. I would move out but she was the one who convinced me to stay here while I‚Äôm taking care of the baby. We live in a fairly large house and I was going to help with the bills if I had anything left over in my monthly budget. She also told me she doesn‚Äôt want to live alone and she doesn‚Äôt want me to struggle while I‚Äôm dealing with a newborn. I‚Äôm planning on taking one year off of work so I can be there with my baby. If I was moving out soon I would just bite my tongue until she had to take care of her own dogs.

So I offered her a room in my house and she was happy to take it. Like I said I live alone so the house is fully furnished, but I didn't want her to have to get rid of the bulk of her furniture so I got rid of my living room set in order to accommodate her furniture. We'd live together for about two months when one Sunday, she told me ""thank you so much for letting me live here, but I'm gonna start looking for another place"".

We have had this conversation about her job, about the stresses of her employment, things of that nature multiple times, So my response to the last conversation about her job, I basically told her I didnt know what she wanted me to say because I could only go over the same talking points so many times and at this point I told her more what I thought rather than telling her what she wanted to hear.

The only thing he does is work 3 days a week, friday, Saturday and Sunday as a server. Other than that he stayed home and plays video games.

71,1dgmgoe,AITA for not forgiving my friend?,"(F15) 2 years ago, one of my close friends and I had a fight. Let's call her Alice. She was upset because I was getting closer to two twins that she used to be friends with, but now she mutually hated them. I would sometimes talk about them, and I gave one of them a nickname, let's say it was coco. Whenever I called him coco, Alice would blow up at me, and would tell me I'm insensitive. She wasn't wrong about that, but then she just started ghosting me. It was hard to avoid each other because we were both in a close friend group

One year ago, talked about what happened, and made up. For about half the year we were pretty close again, and completely comfortable with each other. We were in a musical together, and everything was great until she ghosted me again. Alice would barely look at me or talk to me, and if I asked about it she would shrug it off. I started getting really stressed when she stopped eating lunch with our group and with some of our other friends, because whenever I walked past they would stop talking and all stare at me. Those other friends also started acting less friendly to me, and what felt like a chosen family kind of just fell apart. I don't know if Alice was telling them stuff about me, or something else, but she didn't tell me what I did.

Last month our friend group got into a big fight on our group chat, the main people involved being Alice, me, and some others who were also having trouble with her. Off the group chat I found out that they thought Alice said something to their other friends too because they were acting weird. We all went to the park to meet up and talk.

Near the end of our meeting thingy, Alice told everyone that the reason she was cold to everyone was because she needed space, which is totally valid. When I asked why she never said anything, she said that since she has autism, she has communication issues, which was also totally valid. One of the problems though was that whenever someone got mad at Alice, she would kind of just blame it on autism. Lots of my friends are autistic, and the spectrum is obviously huge, but I feel like she wasn't owning up to any of the stuff she said at me and the others when she was mad and I felt like her apology wasn't enough after us fighting for so long. Honestly her apology just didn't feel sincere.

I still don't know what Alice said about me to all the others, but I'm scared that they hate me for something I didn't do. After the meeting, I apologized to her for thinking she was mad at me, but now having a month to think about it I'm starting to see more layers. I don't know how I feel about her, but I don't think I'm ready to forgive her yet. I just want to disclaim something because I think this post might get backlash, I have no problem with her being autistic. I was so happy when she came out to me because I knew that meant she felt comfortable enough around me. I just felt like Alice was using it as a shield for everything.

So, AITA for not forgiving my friend?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-15,"AITA for not forgiving my friend? (F15) 2 years ago, one of my close friends and I had a fight. Let's call her Alice. She was upset because I was getting closer to two twins that she used to be friends with, but now she mutually hated them. I would sometimes talk about them, and I gave one of them a nickname, let's say it was coco. Whenever I called him coco, Alice would blow up at me, and would tell me I'm insensitive. She wasn't wrong about that, but then she just started ghosting me. It was hard to avoid each other because we were both in a close friend group

One year ago, talked about what happened, and made up. For about half the year we were pretty close again, and completely comfortable with each other. We were in a musical together, and everything was great until she ghosted me again. Alice would barely look at me or talk to me, and if I asked about it she would shrug it off. I started getting really stressed when she stopped eating lunch with our group and with some of our other friends, because whenever I walked past they would stop talking and all stare at me. Those other friends also started acting less friendly to me, and what felt like a chosen family kind of just fell apart. I don't know if Alice was telling them stuff about me, or something else, but she didn't tell me what I did.

Last month our friend group got into a big fight on our group chat, the main people involved being Alice, me, and some others who were also having trouble with her. Off the group chat I found out that they thought Alice said something to their other friends too because they were acting weird. We all went to the park to meet up and talk.

Near the end of our meeting thingy, Alice told everyone that the reason she was cold to everyone was because she needed space, which is totally valid. When I asked why she never said anything, she said that since she has autism, she has communication issues, which was also totally valid. One of the problems though was that whenever someone got mad at Alice, she would kind of just blame it on autism. Lots of my friends are autistic, and the spectrum is obviously huge, but I feel like she wasn't owning up to any of the stuff she said at me and the others when she was mad and I felt like her apology wasn't enough after us fighting for so long.

72,1dgl8jg,AITAH for trying to send my step daughter to camp the week we go on vacation?,"My husband and I each have three kids from our first marriages. I have 17F, 15M, 15M, and he has 16M, 15M, and 14F. We met because our kids are all in the same sports and activities and we‚Äôve been around.

There‚Äôs this week long summer intensive camp that is offered through the dance studio the girls are part of. You have to be invited to even audition and it‚Äôs this whole thing. Usually both girls make it, but this year only my step daughter did.

At first this caused a lot of arguments about hurt feelings and stuff, and I asked my husband not to let her go just to keep things fair. This was the last year my daughter was eligible and his daughter still had 3 more chances. He ultimately left the decision up to her whether or not she wanted to go.

During the same time, my sister invited us all to her lake house for a few days during that same week. This was a blessing to keep my daughter‚Äôs mind off of it, and just some fun for us. 

I admit I have complained a lot about my step daughter to my sister, so she already had a negative view of her, and that was completely wrong of me. I felt like to cause less problems, my step daughter can go to the camp and we can go on vacation.

My husband told me problem solved, his daughter would rather come to the lake house with us. I started pushing for her to go to the camp. This camp is an amazing opportunity, and it‚Äôs only for ages 12-17, so there‚Äôs a limited amount of times they can go. My husband was confused because I was initially adamant that she didn‚Äôt go to the camp and now I‚Äôve changed my tune.

I didn‚Äôt have a chance to really say much before he started acting like a guard dog. We are all currently fighting. My step sons have even been disrespectful towards me. My husband says he feels like I‚Äôm just trying to pawn his daughter off on whatever is easiest for me, and that him nor any of his kids are coming to the lake house. It‚Äôs madness right now. I genuinely believe this is just the least problematic solution for everyone involved.

My girlfriend got defensive, saying I yelled at her aggresively, getting all revved up. She snapped speaking in a bossy manner towards me, while I kept it as calm as possible, explaining her that I did not scream at her, nor was it aggressive , it was just a plain loud yell, something that you do in order to catch the attention of anything that‚Äôs living, for example when your dog is doing something bad and you just let out an ‚ÄúE e e e‚Äù (making weird sounds as a form of ‚Äúdo not do that‚Äù has been done before multiple times but she says it never was this loud).

She got mad when I brought up the fact that you do this to animals and I too, think I could have just told her ‚Äústop it‚Äù, but I thought it would be funnier just letting out that sound. She continued to raise her voice and angerly squinting at me while saying that she considers it aggressive. I told her that I apologize for it but she should stop with the attitude as I kept calm the whole conversation and she was just getting more revved up over the sound I made.

74,1dgkhtk,AITA for taking money out of my son's mom's desk to comp the sitter?,"Our 9yo Jeremy went to sleepaway camp on Tuesday. On Thursday the camp called us and said he lost one of his shoes and we needed to get him a new pair. He was just wearing sandals and they weren't going to take him hiking or trips. The camp is a couple hours away.

We have a sitter who works at the same day camp as our 7yo and he takes him to and from camp and watches him afterwards. I told my ex that I would see if the sitter could find a way to drop off a pair of shoes and we'd pay him twice the amount of whatever hours the trip took him. He said he'd let me know Friday AM. 

Yesterday he said he'd go drop shoes after taking our 7yo to camp and I said great. Later in the afternoon he texted me and said Jeremy already had shoes. I asked what he was talking about and he said my ex placed an Amazon order to the camp. He said he was a bit miffed that he lost pay at the day camp to help us out when he didn't need to make the trip after all. 

I said I didn't even think about your losing pay at the camp and I had no idea my ex placed an order on Amazon. In fact the camp said they don't allow Amazon or UberEats or other delivery services. I said I'd take care of him either way. I called my ex and she said she called the camp director the night before and asked if she could just have shoes delivered and he made an exception.

I told her that our sitter drove all the way out there and is mad. She said that she didn't know he was going. I said no one knew that you placed an order. Had you told me that then I wouldn't had asked the sitter to go. She asked what I wanted from her and I said you should comp him for wasting his time. I'll pay to comp him for half the day and you the other half. So $120 each.

She refused because it was a ""mistake"" and I typically pay him for babysitting. I said this needs to be fixed ASAP because finding a good sitter is very hard to find. She said no.

Last night I went to pick up my 7yo from her house and it was sitter payday. I know my ex keeps thousands in cash in her desk drawer. I took $120 and gave it to the sitter in addition to my $120 and his normal pay.

I told my ex and she was furious and demanded that I pay her back. I said I didn't care. I possibly prevented him from quitting over a lack of communication. Keeping him happy is way more important.

So we had a great morning, I was laying in bed and I get up to grab something and I see the door wide open.( we live on 3rd floor apartment for some context) We have 2 cats and a dog and the dog was on porch barking and cats were nowhere to be found. 
I started yelling for her and she didn‚Äôt respond so I start freaking out and searching for the cats while yelling for her to come help. I find one cat under stairs in our driveway within a minute, but couldn‚Äôt find the other cat. I go up on porch and start screaming for her with no response still, she was upstairs changing and came down, the cat was only in driveway and I screamed at her learn to shut the door because this is the second time in a week she has left it open and the animals have gotten out. 

She acted like it was no big deal and that I was crazy for being upset about it, but it‚Äôs not like we live in a residential neighborhood we live right off an extremely busy main road where cars constantly go 45-50 mph. The bottom of stairs are only 10 feet from the road. 

For some background I have extreme OCD about doors being closed and locked, I will
Leave the house and turn back around to make sure they are all locked if I didn‚Äôt triple check them. It‚Äôs not healthy and is annoying sometimes but I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm having a panic attack if I don‚Äôt know if they are 100% locked and closed. 

Our first fight (4 years ago) was because she left the outdoor gate open and let  my first dog outside accidentally and he almost got out.  

I feel bad and I hate that I screamed at her but my biggest fear is our animals getting out because of the main road and other variables that could happen. I apologized after I calmed down but she‚Äôs still upset with me and won‚Äôt come home.

78,1dgjxaz,AITA for responding harshly to my dad's text? ,"Yesterday, I (31F) went with my fianc√© and a friend to a fair. I had never shot any kind of gun before (for context, law regulations in my country are very strict) but my grandpa had a shotgun and my dad taught me how to aim when I was a kid (with the shotgun unloaded). 

A bit more of context, my relationship with my parents is a bit strained for several reasons. I can give more context if asked, but it's a bit harsh. 

I went to one of those games where you shoot the cans with a bb gun and I did a pretty decent score  (7 in 9 cans, considering I had 12 shots and the gun discharged the last 3 in a row because it was faulty). I was kinda proud of myself and texted my dad about it. The message exchange went as follows:

Me: Turns out I'm quite good at aiming

Dad: You got that after daddy. At 50m, I would shoot off the head of a match. What you don't know is that shooting games always have their aims out of tune so that you purposely miss the target. Which means that you shoot poorly, but due to that you ended up shooting well. üòÑ

Me: No, the aim is right, the bottom cans are just weighed. And even then there were only 2 cans left. I sent you a message because I was happy and proud, and because you were the one who taught me how to aim, but thank you for immediately giving that answer

Dad: Wow, calm down, no one is calling you names or saying bad things about your aim. Sensitive as fuck üôÑ. Of course it was nothing against you. Forget about the fucking paranoia that everyone is out to get you and stop seeing the bad in everything people say to you. It doesn't get you anywhere and it just upsets you.

My dad was pretty mad and thinks I'm kind of an Ahole for saying what I said. I might have been harsh. But this comes after a lifetime of him undermining or underestimating everything I do.

79,1dgjo5v,AITA for wanting my sister to pay for MY car bills after I trusted her with my keys,"I (18, female) and my sister (19, female) were heading into the store to grab a gift for a friend of mine. While I was pulling up to the parking lot, an older man knocked on my window asking me to jump his car. Obviously, my car isn‚Äôt in the best shape, and I was clearly in a rush, so I gave the man an excuse, saying I didn‚Äôt know how to do it. Before I left, my sister interrupted me, saying she knew how to and that she could do it for me. I was a bit peeved, but I still handed over my keys and went inside the store.

When I came out, my sister came over to me and said that my car was smoking. At this point, I was freaking out; I had no clue what was happening. When I finally got to the car, I saw smoke coming from inside and out. I got in and tried to start the car‚Äînothing. I tried again‚Äînothing. After a few minutes, I got it going. I was fully relieved but still upset because we could have avoided this issue if she hadn‚Äôt said anything. I asked her, ‚ÄúHey, why did you tell that guy yes?‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice you didn‚Äôt want to help.‚Äù I honestly just looked at her in disbelief.

Right before we pulled into the road, my car suddenly stopped. We were freaking out because there were cars coming, so we just sat there. Luckily, our house was just across the street. My sister ran home to get her car, hoping we could jump mine. She came back, and we tried jumping it‚Äînothing. After around 30 minutes, some guy came to see what the issue was. He said it wasn‚Äôt a battery issue but more of an engine issue; something had melted. At this point, I was flipping out in my head, but I still had no clue what to do. The man was kind enough to put my car into neutral and pushed it backward all the way into a parking lot.

After some time, I had to go, so I gave my sister the keys and left. When I got back, I got my keys from her and called up a family friend mechanic. He finally got the car to work again, but he said he needed to take it to the shop because there were a bunch of things messed up and melted.

Now, we come to this: I obviously know I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. When I asked my sister when she‚Äôs going to pay for the car bills, she told me she wasn‚Äôt and that it was my car and she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.

80,1dgji1u,AITA for not picking up grandma? ,"#UPDATE: thanks everyone for your responses. I‚Äôm going to tell everyone we‚Äôre going to make the 16 hour drive ü´∂üèª I really needed to hear from outside perspectives that I was in the wrong too. Thank you again. 

My grandma is my mother figure. She never learned how to drive, and even if she did, she would‚Äôve never been able to afford a car. Before I moved 4 hours away, I would take her wherever she needed to go. Most of the time, she stays home. My aunt (call her Jenna) is her primary caretaker and lives next door.

Grandma broke her foot 4 weeks ago and is having a hard time with it. Jenna is going to the beach in a few weeks and was concerned about who is going to be around to check on grandma every day. Jenna had the idea that it would be nice if grandma could stay with me during that week she‚Äôs at the beach. When grandma brought it up to me, I thought, that would be perfect. I live 3 hours from the beach they‚Äôre going to (straight shot) and it would only be a 30 min detour for them to take the route by my house instead of the one they would‚Äôve taken. Then my grandma said ‚ÄúJenna said she doesn‚Äôt have room to take me and said you should come get me‚Äù I live 4 hours away. Any other time this would be fine, as I‚Äôve offered it before. I asked Jenna if she could just bring grandma and we got into an argument. She said she might not have room and she wants to travel on the road with her SIL. I told her she needed to prioritize grandma if she wants her to be taken care of. She started saying that ‚Äúshe bends over backwards for her and I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and tell her she doesn‚Äôt prioritize her‚Äù I apologized for making her think that but told her out of all the options, the most logical one is for her to bring her. 

We came to a compromise, or so I thought, that we‚Äôd meet in a city 40 mins from my house that they have to pass through on every route possible to the beach.I mentioned she‚Äôd get to really relax because she wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about grandma at all during vacation? And it would be a vacation for grandma too because she never gets to go anywhere! Then she told grandma what happened. Grandma was upset last night she‚Äôs the reason we are arguing. She feels like she‚Äôs causing problems and said she might as well not come. Jenna told her that I‚Äôm making her feel like it‚Äôs her responsibility to take her and that I could come get her easily. And J asked grandma why I was so willing to come get her any other time except for this time. She said ‚Äúif we weren‚Äôt going to the beach they‚Äôd have to come get her anyways‚ÄùShe‚Äôs making grandma feel like an inconvenience and at the same time, blaming me saying that the reason I won‚Äôt come get her is because I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôve always said I‚Äôm willing to go get her, but it just sounds crazy to me since Jenna is coming this way. AITA? 

TLDR: grandma can‚Äôt drive, aunt is going on vacation and has to drive through my state to get there. A small detour would allow her to bring grandma to my place so I can watch her and spend time with her, but she wants me to drive 16 hours total to come get her instead.

81,1dgjbo9,AITA for addressing an issue with my brother after our dad's funeral?,"My (27 F) dad recently passed. The whole family attended the funeral and the next few days we had to pack up his house. It was me, my husband, my three siblings and their spouses who did the packing. Day 2 of the packing, I got frustrated and hurt when my sister-in-law (let's call her Beth) kept calling my brother (Jay) by a nickname.

Back story: My sister and older brother are close in age and they have a close relationship. Jay (25 M) and I are about 13 years younger than them and had (and still have) a very close bond growing up. I used to call him by a nickname when we were young. Beth (29 F) was my friend before she and my brother ever became friends or romantically involved. At a certain point in our friendship, when she and Jay became friends, I told her about the nickname I used to call my brother when we were young. She said it's cute and that she is going to start calling him that. It bothered me when she then did call him by the nickname, but I decided to just leave it. 

During their engagement and wedding my and my now husband's relationship with Jay and Beth was not good (don't want to go into that). After we both got married, the relationship gradually improved. However, still every time Beth uses the nickname I am really hurt by it. The nickname was even one of the answers in their wedding crossword. For me it has sentimental value and it feels like she stole it from me. It's something that was special to me and between me and my brother.

So, as we were packing up my dad's house I kept hearing her call him by the nickname. At one point I took him aside and politely asked him to ask her to stop calling him by the nickname infront of me as it is hurtful. I have asked him previously, but he has ignored the request. He came back and told me this is unreasonable and he doesn't even remember the nickname, he only knows her ever using it. We had a fight. Then a few minutes later Beth asked to speak with me and told me I am being childish. She says she can't remember me telling her about it and she heard someone else calling their boyfriend by that name and that's where she got it.

I know it's just a nickname, but it feels like she stole it. It was a special memory between me and my brother that is now tainted. I just wanted to address the issue, as it hurts every single time.

82,1dgjbnr,AITA for not genuinely hating my friends bf and not caring that his feelings are hurt,"AITA for not genuinely hating my friends bf and not caring that his feelings are hurt

Little backstory- I (16F) have two close friends who have boyfriends, both(17F), my friend who we will call Claire. Claire has a boyfriend of around 8 months, he will be called Mason. My other friend we will call Jasmin.
 
Mason is the biggest prick I think I‚Äôve ever met, to Claire and to me and Jasmin. Before they started dating he was playing both of them and telling them not to tell each other, when they started dating (Claire and Mason) he started making fun of me and Jasmin, he would make fun of our looks and our weight and would just be rude in general, he lies about literally everything under the sun even when it‚Äôs just blatantly not true. He‚Äôs made fun of us and he‚Äôs just really mean to Claire, they argue all the time and it gets to the point where she is upset and gets mad at us for saying something when he makes comments about us. I don‚Äôt know why she won‚Äôt just break up with him but it‚Äôs not really my business. Anyway this brings us to this week. 

On Tuesday me and Jasmin are scrolling through TikTok and we see Claires account and all her posts about Mason are down and then we go to his account and the same thing (we thought they broke up). We don‚Äôt want to pry so we wait for her to come to us, when she comes back to school on Thursday she tells us that they were just fighting again but they weren‚Äôt breaking up, and me and Jasmin were like oh ok‚Ä¶.. because right before this fight she got one of those ‚Äúhey girl‚Äù texts from a girl talking about Masons actions at some party out of town. 

Yesterday, Jasmin,Claire and I were at the mall and we went to the food court, while sitting there Claire gets a text from Mason and it‚Äôs a photo of us sitting there eating food, which in itself is really weird. We look around and it‚Äôs almost close so like no one is around. She asks him where he got the photo and he won‚Äôt tell us, he makes weird cryptic comments and is saying like he has eyes everywhere like he‚Äôs the damn CIA. Mind you he‚Äôs at whole party making a joke out of this to his friends. At this point we are all freaked out because it‚Äôs 8:30 in an almost empty mall getting cryptic ass texts. So we leave, later that night we get a text from Claire and she is mad because Mason got a text from Jasmins older brother telling him to basically Fuck off. Now she‚Äôs mad at us because Mason got a text and went to Claire complaining that his feelings are hurt. She gets me at us a lot and and she is always upset that I really hate him and Jasmin really doesn‚Äôt like him for her own reasons. I just want to know if it‚Äôs justified because I don‚Äôt get why she doesn‚Äôt see why I literally hate him.

Here‚Äôs where I may be the Asshole- when she asked us where Jasmins brother got the number and got mad at us I told her I really didn‚Äôt care how Mason felt and that he deserved some for of ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù for how he‚Äôs been acting and that he was gonna walk all over her if she doesn‚Äôt do anything about it I feel like I may be because I could‚Äôve said it better and it came out a lot meaner than I thought it would.

91,1dggphb,AITAH for asking information about a trip?,"I am a 23-year-old female and my boyfriend is 24. A few weeks ago, we had an argument about a trip to Puerto Rico. Originally, this was supposed to be a vacation for him and his friends, but they dropped out. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be on this trip because I had planned to start school a few weeks before. However, I decided to defer my admission due to burnout, just a week before the trip was scheduled.

Seeing that his friends had dropped out, he persistently invited me to join him on the trip, offering to pay for everything. I appreciated the gesture and agreed to go, thinking it would be a nice experience. However, when I asked for the Airbnb information, he refused to share it, stating that since he was paying, he didn‚Äôt need to tell me. My mother wanted the information and to exchange numbers since it was my first time traveling to another island on my own. It‚Äôs to keep both of us safe. He insisted that my mother didn‚Äôt need to know and said he would tell her himself. The Airbnb was bought last minute three days before the trip. The catch is that I had to pay 200 dollars back since the plane ticket was 500 bucks.

Over the span of three days, this became a point of contention. On the last day, I sent him a text, suggested by a friend, which said:

""Hey, I won‚Äôt be able to go on the trip with you. I'm just not comfortable going when I don‚Äôt even know where we‚Äôre staying. If the money is the problem, I‚Äôm open to speaking about it.""

I sent the text because he had previously told me that if I didn‚Äôt want to go, I should stay home, which I took literally. I also offered to pay him back for any expenses. 

Immediately, he began calling me repeatedly, threatening to break up with me if I didn‚Äôt answer.

I was only asking for a simple request that just blew up out of nowhere.


When first bought he states it‚Äôs in San Juan but I just wanted to know the address of where I‚Äôll be living in or send the Airbnb link at least.",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-15,"AITAH for asking information about a trip? I am a 23-year-old female and my boyfriend is 24. A few weeks ago, we had an argument about a trip to Puerto Rico. Originally, this was supposed to be a vacation for him and his friends, but they dropped out. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be on this trip because I had planned to start school a few weeks before. However, I decided to defer my admission due to burnout, just a week before the trip was scheduled.

Seeing that his friends had dropped out, he persistently invited me to join him on the trip, offering to pay for everything. I appreciated the gesture and agreed to go, thinking it would be a nice experience. However, when I asked for the Airbnb information, he refused to share it, stating that since he was paying, he didn‚Äôt need to tell me. My mother wanted the information and to exchange numbers since it was my first time traveling to another island on my own. It‚Äôs to keep both of us safe. He insisted that my mother didn‚Äôt need to know and said he would tell her himself. The Airbnb was bought last minute three days before the trip. The catch is that I had to pay 200 dollars back since the plane ticket was 500 bucks.

Over the span of three days, this became a point of contention. On the last day, I sent him a text, suggested by a friend, which said:

""Hey, I won‚Äôt be able to go on the trip with you. I'm just not comfortable going when I don‚Äôt even know where we‚Äôre staying. If the money is the problem, I‚Äôm open to speaking about it.""

I sent the text because he had previously told me that if I didn‚Äôt want to go, I should stay home, which I took literally. I also offered to pay him back for any expenses. 

Immediately, he began calling me repeatedly, threatening to break up with me if I didn‚Äôt answer. When we finally spoke, he angrily explained that the Airbnb information wasn‚Äôt available because we hadn‚Äôt checked in yet at 8 am. I told him I had no idea and asked why he hadn‚Äôt mentioned this before. He told me that it‚Äôs not my responsibility to say it and could‚Äôve googled that information.

92,1dggilg,AITA for talking back to my mom?,"Yesterday, I (22) talked back to my mom (41) because I felt like she is not hearing my side of the story.

Recently, my mom (41), my dad along with my two younger siblings: Female (15) and Male (3) went away to take care some things concerning the properties they have bought over the years. They went away for 4 days, which left me with my other sibling, male (21).

They came home yesterday morning but while still travelling, my mom already texted me to tell my brother to cook breakfast (my brother is the designated cook in the house) since they will arrive earlier than expected. After receiving the text I immediately informed my brother but he refused to cook saying he still needs to do the laundry. After hearing this, I immediately informed my mom that my brother is doing something else. I think she got mad (based on her tone in the message) and insisted that there should be food already when they arrive.

Scared that she would get mad, I took it upon myself to do the cooking (I only cooked noodles as per her instructions). After cooking, I also cleaned up the house and took care of the dogs.

When they arrive, I was surprised of her outburst saying how useless I am and my brother. She said a lot of hurtful words and I just cannot stand it that's why I talked back. I explained to her that my brother refused to cook since he wants to do his laundry. After hearing this, she raised her voiced at me and I just had enough. I talked back and told her how she always thinks she's right and did not even tried to hear my side of the story and just immediately concluded everything.

Turns out, my brother told her that I did not informed him that they were coming home that is why he did not cook. When my brother went home, I confronted him in the presence of my mom, and after realizing what truly happened my mom did not even apologized to me. Instead, she proceeded to list the things I failed to do while she was away. I'm just so sick of our situation because it feels like whatever I do is not enough for her. She has always been like this before but I never talked back because in our culture it is disrespectful to do so. I just had enough today and there are lots of things on my mind (I have an exam coming up so I'm a bit stress). She later then on sarcastically said that I am always right since I'm about to graduate college and I'm looking down on her. She also added that she'll get back on me if ever I asked her for a favor in the future. And now, she's giving me the silent treatment.

I know she is trying her best to be a mom to us but she just never try to understand us, the only thing important to her is her opinion and that she should be always right.

94,1dgerww,AITA for not going to my friend‚Äôs grandparent‚Äôs funeral?,"I (24f) have a friend (23f) who I‚Äôve been friends with for about a year and a half. We will call her Brooke. We have known of each other since grade school, but did not become close until the end of 2022 and she asked me to be one of her bridesmaids as she was recently engaged and ended up getting married that fall. Everything was fine up until about six months ago. Our friendship unfortunately began to grow distant. It was a collection of things - one part was that our busy lives took over and the other part was that I felt like I was always a second choice for Brooke. Anyways, we hadn‚Äôt hung out since this past March for my birthday and we texted rather infrequently at this point. 

At the end of last month, she reached out to me to let me know her grandpa had passed away. I had met him a few times during our friendship but didn‚Äôt know him super well. I extended my condolences to her and let her know I was there if she needed anything. I read about the viewing and funeral services on Facebook, but I was going out of town. Also, I have a lot of trauma around funerals, and my impression was that these services were for those who were very close to the family or deceased individual, and I was neither anymore. So I showed my support in the way I felt best. 

A few days go by and I checked in with Brooke to see how she was doing, and she said she‚Äôd be okay. I extended my sympathy to her again and with no response, but I wasn‚Äôt upset - she was grieving. About a week goes by, and I read on Facebook that Brooke‚Äôs grandma had also just passed away. I messaged her giving my condolences to which I was received no response. Again, I understand. Last night was Brooke‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs viewing and I reached out once more checking in with her on how she was doing. About an hour goes by and she responds to me that she doesn‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm texting her and she‚Äôs disappointed that I did not attend any of the services for her grandparents and that she thought I was her best friend. I responded with a longer message basically summarizing everything aforementioned in this post. I also explained to her that if she had communicated to me that she could have used my support in person I could have tried harder to make it. I added in that I didn‚Äôt think I needed to show up in person to be a good friend especially since I had reached out to her multiple times since their passing. I apologized nonetheless for hurting her. As of this morning, I have not received a response and I‚Äôm not sure if I will. 

Personally, I don‚Äôt feel it an obligation to attend these type of services and I definitely would not expect my friends to show up if I were going through the same thing especially if they did not know the deceased individual well. I would be content knowing a friend cared enough to reach out to me period. I also know a lot of people don‚Äôt like funerals and I would never expect someone to put themselves in an uncomfortable environment just to ‚Äúprove‚Äù they are a decent friend.

He struggles not to drop or break things, doesn't have good eye-hand coordination. He has always appeared ""clumsy"" and while he does his very best to be careful and to take good care of things, he can't always prevent accidents, breakages or spillages from happening. This is something my sister has expressed frustration about over the years. He was the type of toddler (and now kid) who will be eating or drinking something and it falls to the floor or he knocks stuff over without meaning to because he's reaching for something else. It's not his fault, he does OT to help him and has done physio in the past to boost his strength. But there is no ""cure"" he's just getting help to go through life.

My son has broken many things because of his condition. If it belonged to someone else we have always replaced it or paid for the damages. We also started making sure he used his own stuff/our stuff to prevent this from happening, especially toys my sister's kids have.

But his condition means he can't do everything other kids his age might be able to do. Now this is a huge problem for my sister.

She confronted me after this and asked me what I was teaching my kid when he won't help out family. I told her we're teaching him to work within his means and to not help out someone who will berate him for his condition which she will do. She said we're coddling and spoiling him, that he's more than old enough to learn how to be more careful, to do better and to cause less accidents and make fewer mistakes and he needs to learn to help family. And we need to make him do ""stuff"" for family to be good parents. I told her my son will never help¬†*her*¬†with ""stuff"" because she lacks the compassion and understanding that his efforts would require. Her response was that it was an asshole thing to say that he wouldn't help specifically her and that she's still his aunt and my sister and I'm supposed to be her brother. I told her she's supposed to be my sister and my son's aunt but she edges on bullying him over this and it does not make her a suitable person for him to try helping out.

98,1dgdfat,AITA for refusing to share stuff with someone I don't trust?,"Am I (15 male) an a$$ for telling my sister (17 female) that I don't trust someone (12 female) to take care of my stuff?

For some background my parents are divorced and my sister lives with my dad and I live with my mum. For a while we both lived with my dad but i moved out and when i did i took all of the games for the 3DS and all the Pokemon games for the switch as they had all been giving to specifically me as gifts, I left all my games there that were not Pokemon games however.

My dad shares a house with another family that consists of the mum and 2 kids, I'm not related to any of them and don't consider them family as I share no blood with them and never see them. I think my sister sees them as family which I understand but it's not a mutual feeling as there's little to no reason for me to see them as family. This family tends to be very messy and not take care of most of their things as well as losing stuff a lot.

Recently my older sister asked me to lend her one of my games to give to one of the kids, Lily(female 12), I told her no since I didn't trust my sister or Lily to return the game in a timely manner or in a good condition. My sister got extremely annoyed and claimed it was a game to share, I reminded her it was given to me as a birthday gift years back and this annoyed her further. 

She claims that I couldn't play all my games anyway but I simply don't trust them to return it considering they've lost one of my games for several years until someone miraculously found it. My sister tried to get my mum involved to make me give it to her which was a complete fail considering my mum was fully on my side but now my sister is mad at me and it's really annoying me considering she barely comes over and is now spending her time mad at me.

We meet up all together usually once a month just to get together and catch up and which generally turn into pretty late nights. One of my closest friends ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù (27M) was in attendance tonight which is a rare occasion due to him traveling frequently for work. He and Ashley don‚Äôt particularly care for one another but never have had any large altercations until tonight. 

We were at one of our local biergartens just hanging out and Ashley and I were just getting ready to say our goodbyes. We had all had a few drinks in the time that we had been there. We usually stay out with everyone but Ashley and I have an appointment at the bridal shop at 10 am and with the florist at 11:30 and a few other errands for the day so we didn‚Äôt want to be out super late. Alex and a few others were going to go to a club after the biergarten and they invited us out with them but Ashley politely declined. Alex said ‚ÄúWho asked you?

We started to get our things together and leave and Alex said ‚ÄúStop being a pussy. She‚Äôs had you by the balls since you guys started dating. I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs the man in the relationship.‚Äù

After that, I let him have it. His ex girlfriend ‚ÄúAmy‚Äù of 3 years cheated on him with his brother and his former roommate and I said ‚ÄúMaybe if you had been ‚Äúthe man‚Äù in your relationship, Amy wouldn‚Äôt have felt the need to sleep with other men. I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and allow you to speak to my fianc√© and I this way.‚Äù That definitely set him off. He started to berate me for the low blow and told me that what I said was fucked up. A few of our friends also said that what I said wasn‚Äôt cool. In the moment, I personally didn‚Äôt care. I just didn‚Äôt appreciate him be so disrespectful towards us.

Like dont get me wrong they play the same games but they have whole diferent vibes, while john has some acidic humor (wich i wont lie i have too), the group is more soft and friendly (wich i can be too), so im certain they wont handle each other well

I am a whole diferent person with john, and another one with the group (as in the memes like ""when i use my personality of friend group 1 in friend group 3"", but i dont do it for the meme thats just the way i am idk)

Anyway I feel Im doing something wrong but at the same time i feel Im not please help ",4.0,1.057259440422058,1,0

115,1dgady2,AITA: Quitting my job?,"I am currently 20(F), but when I was 16, I decided to get my first job at a fast food restaurant due to the pressure of my parents, only because they thought I should learn some responsibility. I agreed, and got hired immediately on the spot at my first interview. (16 is the minimum age to be hired legally in my state) 

Everything was going well at first, and I got to know all my coworkers who were a lot older than I was. A few shifts in, I noticed the manager being very flirtatious and joked a lot about the minor girls who got hit on when they worked here to me, at first I thought it was just friendly banter, but soon I felt a weird gross feeling in my stomach every shift that would happen. I knew something was wrong and decided to open up to my therapist about it. (I was too nervous to tell my parents) She validated my feelings and told me the things he would do and say to me don‚Äôt seem like a normal and safe work relationship, and after a month of enduring this behavior, I open up to my parents about it. 

My mom, being the sweetest person ever agreed that this was a creepy and odd work environment that I was in. My dad on the other hand, ridiculed me into thinking I was overthinking it, and that ‚ÄúHe was just being nice,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you so bothered by men talking to you?‚Äù And basically gaslighted me into thinking I was flattering myself, and a part of me did believe him. I felt ashamed in myself, but eventually after opening up to more women in my family about it, I finally felt strong enough to just leave the job all together. 

My dad WAS NOT happy about this in any way. He not only yelled at me for weeks after this, but constantly reminded me of the fact that he believed I quit because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like guys talking to me.‚Äù and that I ‚Äúmisjudged a man of good character and that I should be ashamed of myself.‚Äù And often laughed about it after I had to explain why I quit my first ever job to others.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-15,"AITA: Quitting my job? I am currently 20(F), but when I was 16, I decided to get my first job at a fast food restaurant due to the pressure of my parents, only because they thought I should learn some responsibility. I agreed, and got hired immediately on the spot at my first interview. (16 is the minimum age to be hired legally in my state) 

Everything was going well at first, and I got to know all my coworkers who were a lot older than I was. A few shifts in, I noticed the manager being very flirtatious and joked a lot about the minor girls who got hit on when they worked here to me, at first I thought it was just friendly banter, but soon I felt a weird gross feeling in my stomach every shift that would happen. I knew something was wrong and decided to open up to my therapist about it. (I was too nervous to tell my parents) She validated my feelings and told me the things he would do and say to me don‚Äôt seem like a normal and safe work relationship, and after a month of enduring this behavior, I open up to my parents about it. 

My mom, being the sweetest person ever agreed that this was a creepy and odd work environment that I was in. My dad on the other hand, ridiculed me into thinking I was overthinking it, and that ‚ÄúHe was just being nice,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you so bothered by men talking to you?‚Äù And basically gaslighted me into thinking I was flattering myself, and a part of me did believe him. I felt ashamed in myself, but eventually after opening up to more women in my family about it, I finally felt strong enough to just leave the job all together. 

My dad WAS NOT happy about this in any way. He not only yelled at me for weeks after this, but constantly reminded me of the fact that he believed I quit because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like guys talking to me.‚Äù and that I ‚Äúmisjudged a man of good character and that I should be ashamed of myself.‚Äù And often laughed about it after I had to explain why I quit my first ever job to others.

Imagine my surprise today when I went into my credit tracker and found my credit score had dropped over 100 points! I frantically checked for the reason, thinking it was because I had applied for pre approval for a car loan (one of the reasons I‚Äôve been working on my credit score).

NOPE. Turns out, our mortgage hasn‚Äôt been paid in over two months.

BACKSTORY: I‚Äôve been married 17 years. At the beginning of our marriage, I handled all the finances. About 12 years ago, I complained once that it was stressful to pay all the bills while working a full time job. Husband, who has ADHD and bipolar (important later), reacted by seizing all the bills and putting them in his name. I let him do it because it really was stressful to manage a house, young kids, a job, and the bills!

Several times over the years, he has gone on a bipolar bender. I won‚Äôt go into details because it‚Äôs a totally different story, but it‚Äôs has been very traumatic and is usually prefaced by him failing to pay bills, running through our money, and then lying about it.

I have tried numerous times to take back some autonomy over the bills over the years. We have set expectations with our therapist that I have access to all of the accounts and bill pays‚Ä¶ and that lasts a few months. The last time he switched jobs, he failed to sign up for direct deposit (mine goes to our joint account), so I never know how much money he is sitting on. He makes twice as much as I do, and we have longstanding norms that our money is shared. 

We happened to be in the car together when I discovered the credit slip.  He assured me the mortgage had been paid, and I started to gather the info needed to contest the derogatory mark. All of a sudden, he went on a tirade about all the things he‚Äôs doing wrong and all the people he‚Äôs disappointing. I knew then that he had lied‚Äî the mortgage hadn‚Äôt been paid.

Relating to these types of restrooms, my understanding has always been that a closed door indicates ""occupied"" and an open door indicates ""unoccupied"".

There is a local bar near me that has this type of restroom and 90% of the time I use it, I get walked in on.

128,1dg81ib,AITA For Not Offering To Care For My Unwell Ex-Husband?,"Throwaway Account

I (56f) have been married to my wife ""Angela"" (56f) for a year and we're planning our first anniversary celebration with a trip overseas. I was very excited to spend this time with my wife but unfortunately my ex-husband ""Dan"" (58m) recent hospitalization is putting a damper on my plans.

Backstory: I met Dan in college and we got married shortly after graduating when we found out that I was pregnant. At the time it felt like the right thing to do but looking back it was a bad idea. I resented having to put my career aspirations on hold in order to be the full time caregiver and Dan resented having to be the main financial provider. However, this did not stop him from constantly bringing it up whenever I asked him to help with the kids or the home. He also never defended me when his mother would stop by (unannounced) and the household wasn't up to ""the Queen's standard."" I felt so exhausted and trapped and if it weren't for my kids Junior (34), Sarah (32f), Michelle (29f) and Mike (29m) I would've left years ago. Unfortunately, Dan did not have the same values as me and blindsided me with divorce papers. It was a rough process but after the first year of our divorce being finalized I got my groove back and within the next four years I was able to get a nice apartment and good career.

Present Day: A couple of weeks ago Dan was rushed to the hospital and while the doctors were able to save him, his health took a turn for the worse. His wife is now essentially working to provide for their kids, while her parents watch them to save on daycare. I learned all of this through my children as I do not care to have any direct contact with Dan, but almost every time I talk to them they always bring up how stressed and tired they are over having to look after their father. I thought I was just being a sympathetic ear but a couple of days ago my children came together to confront me about my lack of willingness to offer assistance to their father and as their mother I should want to care for him to make their own lives easier. My children know that while I have a full time job I can make up my own hours and they want me to come into his house at least twice a week to make sure he's clean and fed or pay for a nurse to come do it. I refused stating that Dan and I have been divorced for years and that their stepmom can handle that. That's when they told me that she didn't care about their dad like they do and is most likely hoping for him to pass so she can collect on his insurance policy as the legal wife.

My daughter Sarah then began to cry and asked me if I cared whether or not she had a dad anymore while Junior and Mike thought that I was being bitter. Michelle asked me to put them first and that I can reschedule my anniversary trip with Angela. My former In Laws are also calling me to say that I need to do this and that I'd be a horrible mom.

Now with the issue. My stepdaughter a few months ago started wearing boxers. Just around the house no big deal no different than any other lounge shorts she owns. But the past 2 weeks  I've noticed her leaving the house or coming home wearing the boxers. A few nights ago I told my wife that I found it weird that she's wearing boxers out In public.

It still bothered me. So this morning when my stepdaughter was downstairs in boxer shorts and a t-shirt I asked if she's going out in that today. She shrugged and said probably, why. I said well I think you have plenty of other short options to wear. She asked what was wrong with what she was wearing. I just said wearing boxer shorts in public makes her look stupid and that she has many other lounge shorts she could wear instead of boxers.

My car was in no way hindering his ability to get in and out of the garage. When he got home from work, he decided to park diagonally directly in front of my car, blocking me in. I was only staying a few hours; it wasn't even like I'd be there overnight or for an extended period of time. I had gone out with my parents in their car, and when we got back, we saw how he'd parked, and naturally I was pissed. My dad laughed about it and parked in front of my brother's car, thus blocking HIM in. My mom immediately got defensive and was saying ""maybe he had groceries to bring in; maybe he needed the bathroom"" etc. and coming up with all kinds of excuses. I said, ""Clearly he was being a spiteful prick and is just blocking me in"" I'm also 6m pregnant and hormonal rage is real, and my parents told me I was over-reacting. A while later, my brother came downstairs to go out somewhere, and seeing his car was now blocked in, he just took my parents car out wherever he was going (he didn't ask, just left) and my parents said nothing to him in passing. My mom then proceeded to tell me to go move my car and drive over the lawn, and again, there's a steep hill and several bushes and trees that would have to be carefully avoided in order to do so. Also, I was still pissed and felt like my parents should have told HIM to move HIS CAR! Or said anything to him about it at all.
