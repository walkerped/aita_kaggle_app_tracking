0,1dhcmlk,AITA for yelling at my parents while they were arguing?,"hi. throwaway account.

so im 17 [ftm] and im dating sam [18 ftm]. i've known him for over 10 years so we know a lot about each other and our home lives and whatever. my parents [both 41] have been married for 17 years but they should not be married. they don't like each other and they don't work together. they get into arguments often. they used to get very intense, but that doesn't happen anymore luckily. i also have a sister, mary [14 f] who has witnessed this shit for most of her life.

so my parents have been having another one of their time periods where during the summer they argue fucking constantly. it's really annoying and stressful for me, and i can tell it upsets my sister as well. my mom screams at the top of her lungs when they argue so it's literally impossible to ignore, even if you go outside. i had sam over at my house a week ago and we were just hanging out in my room when i hear my mom starting her screaming fits. i was mad, because why the hell are you starting this when i have a friend over?? i also thought my sister still had her friend over, who hasn't known her for long and i didn't know if he knew about how our parents are, so i was mad for her too.

they were in their room with the door closed, which is down the hallway. i stepped out of my room and yelled ""shut up! we have people over! what the hell is wrong with you??"" and then went back in my room. they stopped after that. i'm protective over my sister so i tend to get really angry when they argue like that. they are adults. there is no need to scream at people over laundry.

when we took sam home, my mom yelled at me in the car about being disrespectful and getting into their arguments. she's been mad at me since and won't talk to me or take me to work. it just really made me upset that they would argue like that when i have someone over. that's disrespectful to the guest imo. aita for getting mad at them though?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-16,"AITA for yelling at my parents while they were arguing? hi. throwaway account.

We have the casual tiff but this was the biggest one. I’m a tattoo artist at a local shop in our area, I’m still apprenticng, wich means money is a bit harder to come by. My best friend’s bully (19F) sent me a message a couple of days ago regarding a tattoo and I decided just to half swipe her and leave it there. My best friend and her bully used to be close at the beginning of school but they ended up having a falling out. Her bully spread countless routers about her and both me and my best friend hate her guts.
Yesterday, I was working. I went out to the bathroom and came back in to see one of my co workers (32 M) writing in my bookings book while talking to the said bully! He had seen I had a full day available on Monday and was doing me a solid. A full day is $500 and I have a big holiday trip coming up and need the money as I have been saving big time.
I let my best friend know that I was going to tattoo her bully. She now won’t talk to me and made sure I knew I was being a horrible friend.

2,1dgx3xt,AITA for telling mum I don't want a scholarship?,"My mum's always been very hardworking. When I and my siblings were younger, we lived in a very low-income household. Mum had to figure out how to balance 2 kids and 3 jobs, which meant a lot of the little money we had went to sitters, and I had a \*lot\* of health issues which meant hospital bills, too. We're well off now, living comfortably in a middle-class home. Mum worked really hard to make sure we were able to afford good schooling, too. I attend one of the top schools in my state, but mum feels I don't make much of it.

For a little more context here too, I'm autistic. I'm very particular about how things have to be for me to focus, and in the massive public school (with over 4,000 students) she put me in, I am incredibly easily overwhelmed. The school never thought I was sufficiently autistic enough to get help in classes, so I struggled a lot. I've also been diagnosed with clinical depression, and sometimes have huge slumps where I can't find the motivation to get up and do things.

Most of this has translated into poor grades, and my mum is very disappointed in me; says I'm lazy and should be ashamed of myself. I try my best, but struggle to get very much done under pressure, so I understand what she means.

Not long ago, an offer was extended to mum and I saying that if I can maintain a 3.0 GPA or higher, I can get a fully paid scholarship to any school in the US. Mum was ecstatic, talking about how big of an opportunity this was and how it would save tens of thousands- saying I could go to a good college with a good art program (I've always been a creative) and be set. But I told her that I couldn't handle high school as it stands, and that I needed time to think about it. She was devastated, but said it was ok to just sleep on it.

I told her that I don't want to go to college, which is half-true. There's art schools I've looked at, you know, obviously I've thought about it, and I understand that finding a career without it is more than just difficult, but I know myself well enough to know that I can't handle the stress of having so many things to do, so little time to do it, and I also know that having to walk around a campus would be terrible for me (due to medical issues mentioned at beginning of post).

Mum got really heated, saying I didn't know what I was talking about and that I needed to go to college if I want to do anything with my life.

3,1dgx1n1,AITA for Calling Out My Friend for Ruining My 21st Birthday Celebration at the Bar?,"I (m21)recently celebrated my 21st birthday by going out to a bar with a group of friends. I was really looking forward to this milestone birthday and had planned a night of fun, drinks, and just enjoying the company of my friends. One of my friends, Tom (22m), who I've known for a few years, joined us. Tom has a tendency to make everything about himself, but I thought he could manage to keep it cool for one night.

The evening started off great. Everyone was having a good time and I was finally able to legally enjoy a few drinks. But then Tom showed up and immediately started talking about how he just got promoted at work. While we all congratulated him and I was genuinely happy for him, he kept bringing it up and monopolizing the conversation.

Things got worse when Tom decided to turn the whole celebration into his own spotlight. He started buying rounds of drinks, but instead of just celebrating, he kept making toasts to himself and talking about his promotion, his plans, and his bright future. He even stood on a chair at one point to get everyone's attention to tell some long story about a project at work.

I finally had enough and pulled Tom aside. I told him that while I was happy for him, this night was supposed to be about my birthday, and he was completely taking over. Tom got defensive, accused me of being selfish and jealous, and stormed out of the bar. Now, some of our friends are saying I overreacted and should have just let it go.

4,1dgwgj0,AITA for telling off my girlfriend's parents?,"I (20m) have a girlfriend we'll call Mal (20f). Mal was very sheltered growing up and her parents were very harsh. Her relationship with them was a weird mix being very close and them making her feel awful. Mal is also autistic and they knew that but insisted that her go without extra help for that. I have heard a lot of stories of her growing up and I didn't like them at all. 

When we got together, Mal was 18 and had moved out of her parent's house without them wanting her to. She was really nervous around her family for a while because her moving created a lot of tension. After months of that things were closer to normal again. She and I were very close but she was worried to introduce us as she was sure her parents wouldn't like me. After a while she introduced us and before hand she gave me a list of things not to bring up so that they don't start anything weird. The meeting went ok, no yelling or fighting, but they dont like me and quite frankly I dont like them. Same goes for her sister; Dora (23f) but less so.   
  
Since then, her parents have made it clear they think Mal is being dumb for being with me. They make comments about it sometimes but she defends me whenever they do. She is a lot mousier around them than other people. 

Mal is getting a service dog. She told her her parents about it and her mom was very critical. She told her that having a service dog would be nice but that she shouldn't take advantage of that system as things are getting harder for people who actually need them. Mal I could tell was upset but calmly defended this by talking about her struggles that one would help with. Her mom said that she doesn't need one and that her struggles aren't that bad. Mal doubled down on how much she actually does struggle. They got in a fight with her mom calling her things like a ""spoiled brat.""

I couldn't stand Mal being treated this way. I'd never heard them call her a brat but I had heard them call her stupid. I know they called her worse sometimes when she was younger. I raised my voice but didn't yell. I told them off about everything. I told them off about this, writing off and refusing to address her disability, blaming her for her struggles, sheltering her to a point it was detrimental to her development, calling her names, judging me so much and not accepting us, etc..

They told me to leave now or they would call the police so I left right away, Mal went with me. She just cried all the way to her place. Her parents have been mad at her and I since then.

5,1dgwe4k,WIBTA if I told my Dad Boss that my Mom Boss is cheating on him?,"I’m a nanny. I just found out that the mom I work for has met up with a guy on Ashley Madison. I was sent a post from one of the “are we dating the same guy” facebook pages of a woman describing my mom boss- we’re going to call her Emily- by her name, hair color, car model and color, and identifying the area she lived in. The post asked if anyone knew this woman because her husband was found on ashley madison and admitted to meeting up with her. 

I messaged the author of the post saying that her post was about my boss. She said that her husband said they “met up at a gas station once but left after 10mins” because he felt too guilty. She doesn’t believe him, and doesn’t believe “Emily” was the only girl. I share the same sentiment that if Emily met up with him then he probably wasn’t the only guy she met up with regardless if they did or did not have sex. 

Now about my mom boss, Emily, and my dad boss, Jason. Emily has never liked me. I have watched their kids for a little over 4 years, they have two young kids. The boy is now 12 and the girl is now 4.5 (I started when the baby girl was just months old), and she has shown such a lack of interest; respect; and communication the entirety of my employment. 

From leaving me with the kids for hours after she was supposed to be there with no communication & not answering a number of calls and texts from me; to straight up hostility toward me and outbursts of anger when I told her I had plans and could not work late for trivial things like her going to pick up a new purse. When she would finally show up after 2/3hrs of leaving me with the kids and not answering or not offering any communication, she wouldn’t say a single word to me. No “I’m sorry” or “thank you for staying with them I was held up ___” just got the kids and left. Barely made eye contact with me.  Jason and I have a much better relationship, he is interested in my life and hearing about my opinions, he had great communication and always respects me. Jason is the best father. We share the same parenting opinions and techniques and are always on the same page. He has had to apologize for Emily’s behavior on a number of occasions. 

Emily and Jason have had issues in their marriage and actually separated for a few months. They didn’t tell me anything and I never asked; one day Jason was just not in the house anymore and comments from the youngest kid were “daddy’s never coming home” “daddy’s staying at uncle ____ house”  One night Jason had to pick something up from my house that I had picked up for one of the kids and he told me what was going on. Emily essentially had a mid-life crisis and flipped out on him and her own parents. She stated that she was forced to be someone she wasn’t and she wants to be who she wants blah blah blah. Became very obsessive with Jason and was upset at his and her parents relationship while all of them were just questioning what was going on with her: their daughter and his wife. She dyed her hair to an unnatural “party” color, got tattoos, and was very awful to Jason. I know I only know his side, but knowing Emily for 4 years I believe him. 

This is when I finally told him how I felt that she never liked me around and asked him about those really awful instances of her hostility towards me and leaving me with the kids. He said that she just doesn’t like anyone that’s happy with their lives, and she’s super insecure, she’s an introvert and will never do anything fun with him, and she’s just overall an unhappy person. I’m not sure what happened, but after a few months of separation Jason was back at the house. 

Jason and I haven’t really talked about them or their separation, but we have talked about my life and aspirations and goals and he’s hinted very ominously phrases like “well I’m sure I won’t be here too much longer” ; “well it’s not like I know where I stand” ; “I don’t know what will happen in the next few years..” They are now house hunting for a larger home to move into. 

So there’s the context of my relationship and events with Emily and Jason. I know the meeting between Emily and the poster’s husband was during their separation, but Emily told him she was in an “open marriage” which I know that is not true, nor has ever been true- not even when they were separated. Regardless if she did or didn’t sleep with that guy; regardless if it was just a 10min meeting at a gas station or a full blown affair, I’m sure he wasn’t the only one. He has been put through so much by her, he deserves to know. Jason would absolutely leave my name out of everything. He would never tell her that I told him this stuff. He would say he got the screenshots from another friend or a random person all together. 

I won’t be working with them past this summer as I’m continuing with my education and won’t have the time to continue nannying. WIBTA if I told Jason at all, now or once I’m no longer employed?

7,1dgw8h3,AITA for telling my husband I don't want his daughter going on vacation with us?,"My husband has a 16yo daughter,  Amy, with his ex. She's a huge Disney kid, which I get I was too. We have 2 kids together, Ryan and Ella, 9yo and 2yo.

Amy goes to Disney usually 5 times a year. Twice with her mom, twice with my husband, and her maternal grandparents take her every Christmas break. The younger kids and I have never gone with my husband and Amy as it's a tradition they've had since she was a baby.

We (my husband, me and our 2 kids together) have a trip planned for early August to go to a different theme park for a few days. It was agreed that this would be a just the 4 of us trip as it will be our kids first theme park trip. Initially, my husband said he wasn't inviting Amy as she will have just gotten back from Disney with her mom a few days before. (My husband takes her every year over Thanksgiving and Spring break.)

Whenever we've included Amy in any of our trips, she complains nonstop, it's boring, stupid, useless, she hates it, Disney is better, it's a waste of time, and she has a really pissy mood the whole time. I'm not looking forward to that. I think the 2 younger kids deserve a fun time without Amy basically throwing a tantrum. Last time, we went to a waterpark, Amy got pissy because she wanted Disney again, so she turned off her phone and ran off. We all spent the next several hours looking for her and by the time we found her it was time to go and nobody was able to enjoy the day.

I told my husband I do not want her to go with us and my reasons why. He says I'm being unfair and Amy is still one of the kids and if we're taking out 2 then it's only fair to include Amy. I told him if he insists on Amy going, I'll make other accommodations for myself, Ryan and Ella. He told me I'm being an asshole and try to see how that would make Amy feel.

AITA?

Edit: Amy has said she does not care at all about our trip. We're going to Legoland, not Disney. My husband wants Amy to go with us since he's worried she'll end up regretting it later if she skips it.

Edit2: Amy hates all things Lego. And when I said separate accommodations I meant if Amy goes, I'd book a separate room at the same place for me and the younger ones. My husband can room with Amy and deal with her attitude and behavior. In the past, aside from the waterpark incident, Amy has gotten upset and refused to leave the room which meant we all had to sit in the room all day because it wouldn't be fair for anyone else to go have fun when she's clearly unhappy.

Edit3: the Disney trips are each a full week (7 days) each time with resort stay. 14 days a year with her dad, 14 with her mom, and another 7 with her grandparents. It's not a little day trip or 2-3 day stay.

8,1dgw88u,AITA for not buying my friend a wedding gift?,"My (30F) very close friend (31F) just got married two weekends ago and I was a bridesmaid. Needless to say, being in her bridal party was more expensive than I anticipated (I think more than she anticipated too). We went to Vegas for her bachelorette party a couple months ago, her shower cost $300 per bridesmaid, not to mention the group shower gift between all the bridesmaids, wedding hair, makeup, shoes, dress and alternations. The wedding was in another state so my husband and I had to drive in, book a hotel and pay my MIL for the weekend to watch our daughter and dogs. All in all I spent roughly $5,500 after it was all said and done. I thought after all the money I put toward being apart of her bridal party AND setting up her shower, setting up her wedding, and cleaning up the wedding venue, a wedding gift wasn’t necessary. 

Apparently I was wrong. When she got back from her honeymoon she called me to say she just went through all of her wedding gifts and didn’t see one from me and asked if I left it at home. I told her I didn’t buy her anything and that after all I did physically and financially in the bridal party that I didn’t think a gift was a dealbreaker. She told me it was $160 a head ($320 for me and my husband) and it’s “standard” to give a gift to cover the cost of your seat. I didn’t even know how to respond other than with sorry. She said “it’s whatever” hung up and she hasn’t talked to me since. I tried texting her the next day to ask how the honeymoon was and she read it and didn’t respond. This is the first time I’ve been IN a wedding, I’ve only ever attended as a guest/+1. I really didn’t think a gift was necessary, but maybe I misjudged the situation. AITA?

9,1dgvyg8,AITA for allowing a visitor to see my stepson while he was in the hospital?,"I have an 9yo stepson named Matt. Last Tuesday he had a seizure at school. He never had one and there is no family history. He was brought to the hospital and was discharged on Friday so they could run tests, observe and consult specialists. My wife and her ex both work in banking and had quarter deadlines that they have to meet so they couldn't stay with Matt during the day. I WFH so I was with him all morning and afternoons.

Matt had a lot of visitors including his friends, the vice principal and his 2nd grade teacher from last year. His current teacher,  Mrs. P,  only sent an email to my wife and her ex to say that she hopes Matt feels better. Matt's dad ""Mike"" hates Mrs P and Mrs P probably hates him back.

School ended on Thursday and Matt was discharged same day after they found nothing wrong with him. Mrs P emailed me, my wife and Mike to see if she could see Matt before he left the hospital. I said sure. He loves visitors and probably is sick of seeing me all day. Mike then emailed Mrs P and said no need to visit because she was probably too ""busy"" with school ending and the VP and another teacher already came by. She didn't respond. Ouch.

Then he emailed me saying I had zero business approving visitors and Mrs P was probably pressed to visit after the VP came by. He didn't want her to visit and he thinks she didn't really want to visit. I told him to chill and I've been helping out.

He said that he had primary custody and I should had asked permission before telling people that they could see Matt. I said just because you and this teacher don't like each other that doesn't make me collateral damage. You should be thanking me.

10,1dgvq99,AITA for being mad my ex basically stole $1200?,"Okay so I (40F) am separated from my husband (47M). I also happen to make a significantly higher income and have continued to help support him financially during the separation (for example, I deposit $4000 a month into his checking account and cover the costs for any shared expenses we still have as the divorce is not final). I have tried to be as amicable as possible for the sake of our kids (17 and 13). 

Our 17 year old son has wanted a “project car” and has been saving up money and had about $1200 saved. He found a car he wanted for a really really good price last week. He was at his dad’s house and called me and I ended up Paypal-ing the guy selling the car $2200 for the car + towing. It turns out the seller has a lot of experience with another type of car that my ex has had sitting and rotting in the driveway for almost a decade and he worked it out with the guy that he would tow it back this car to his shop to fix it up and get it running. 

Anyway I went over to see the car and learned that my son had given the $1200 in cash he had saved to his dad (my ex) who then gave it to the guy to deal with his car. Keep in mind I am the one who paid for the project car for my son with an expectation that I’d be paid back ($1200 and then the rest of it over time from his job). It wasn’t discussed with me that my ex would be handing the cash over to the seller to deal with his other car, so I was a bit annoyed that he did that. 

In asking him about it, I was more or less informed that the money shouldn’t matter to me because I have a high salary and I was being unreasonable and petty. I told him that I feel taken advantage of and that just because I have a good job it doesn’t mean that he is entitled to take $1200 from me without even discussing it. He did a similar thing around Christmas where I paid for something and my son gave him the cash (around $500) and I let it slide. 

So am I the asshole?
