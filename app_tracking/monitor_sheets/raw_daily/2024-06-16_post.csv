0,1dhcmlk,AITA for yelling at my parents while they were arguing?,"hi. throwaway account.

so im 17 [ftm] and im dating sam [18 ftm]. i've known him for over 10 years so we know a lot about each other and our home lives and whatever. my parents [both 41] have been married for 17 years but they should not be married. they don't like each other and they don't work together. they get into arguments often. they used to get very intense, but that doesn't happen anymore luckily. i also have a sister, mary [14 f] who has witnessed this shit for most of her life.

so my parents have been having another one of their time periods where during the summer they argue fucking constantly. it's really annoying and stressful for me, and i can tell it upsets my sister as well. my mom screams at the top of her lungs when they argue so it's literally impossible to ignore, even if you go outside. i had sam over at my house a week ago and we were just hanging out in my room when i hear my mom starting her screaming fits. i was mad, because why the hell are you starting this when i have a friend over?? i also thought my sister still had her friend over, who hasn't known her for long and i didn't know if he knew about how our parents are, so i was mad for her too.

they were in their room with the door closed, which is down the hallway. i stepped out of my room and yelled ""shut up! we have people over! what the hell is wrong with you??"" and then went back in my room. they stopped after that. i'm protective over my sister so i tend to get really angry when they argue like that. they are adults. there is no need to scream at people over laundry.

when we took sam home, my mom yelled at me in the car about being disrespectful and getting into their arguments. she's been mad at me since and won't talk to me or take me to work. it just really made me upset that they would argue like that when i have someone over. that's disrespectful to the guest imo. aita for getting mad at them though?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-16,"AITA for yelling at my parents while they were arguing? hi. throwaway account.

We have the casual tiff but this was the biggest one. I’m a tattoo artist at a local shop in our area, I’m still apprenticng, wich means money is a bit harder to come by. My best friend’s bully (19F) sent me a message a couple of days ago regarding a tattoo and I decided just to half swipe her and leave it there. My best friend and her bully used to be close at the beginning of school but they ended up having a falling out. Her bully spread countless routers about her and both me and my best friend hate her guts.
Yesterday, I was working. I went out to the bathroom and came back in to see one of my co workers (32 M) writing in my bookings book while talking to the said bully! He had seen I had a full day available on Monday and was doing me a solid. A full day is $500 and I have a big holiday trip coming up and need the money as I have been saving big time.
I let my best friend know that I was going to tattoo her bully. She now won’t talk to me and made sure I knew I was being a horrible friend.

2,1dgx3xt,AITA for telling mum I don't want a scholarship?,"My mum's always been very hardworking. When I and my siblings were younger, we lived in a very low-income household. Mum had to figure out how to balance 2 kids and 3 jobs, which meant a lot of the little money we had went to sitters, and I had a \*lot\* of health issues which meant hospital bills, too. We're well off now, living comfortably in a middle-class home. Mum worked really hard to make sure we were able to afford good schooling, too. I attend one of the top schools in my state, but mum feels I don't make much of it.

For a little more context here too, I'm autistic. I'm very particular about how things have to be for me to focus, and in the massive public school (with over 4,000 students) she put me in, I am incredibly easily overwhelmed. The school never thought I was sufficiently autistic enough to get help in classes, so I struggled a lot. I've also been diagnosed with clinical depression, and sometimes have huge slumps where I can't find the motivation to get up and do things.

Most of this has translated into poor grades, and my mum is very disappointed in me; says I'm lazy and should be ashamed of myself. I try my best, but struggle to get very much done under pressure, so I understand what she means.

Not long ago, an offer was extended to mum and I saying that if I can maintain a 3.0 GPA or higher, I can get a fully paid scholarship to any school in the US. Mum was ecstatic, talking about how big of an opportunity this was and how it would save tens of thousands- saying I could go to a good college with a good art program (I've always been a creative) and be set. But I told her that I couldn't handle high school as it stands, and that I needed time to think about it. She was devastated, but said it was ok to just sleep on it.

I told her that I don't want to go to college, which is half-true. There's art schools I've looked at, you know, obviously I've thought about it, and I understand that finding a career without it is more than just difficult, but I know myself well enough to know that I can't handle the stress of having so many things to do, so little time to do it, and I also know that having to walk around a campus would be terrible for me (due to medical issues mentioned at beginning of post).

Mum got really heated, saying I didn't know what I was talking about and that I needed to go to college if I want to do anything with my life.

3,1dgx1n1,AITA for Calling Out My Friend for Ruining My 21st Birthday Celebration at the Bar?,"I (m21)recently celebrated my 21st birthday by going out to a bar with a group of friends. I was really looking forward to this milestone birthday and had planned a night of fun, drinks, and just enjoying the company of my friends. One of my friends, Tom (22m), who I've known for a few years, joined us. Tom has a tendency to make everything about himself, but I thought he could manage to keep it cool for one night.

The evening started off great. Everyone was having a good time and I was finally able to legally enjoy a few drinks. But then Tom showed up and immediately started talking about how he just got promoted at work. While we all congratulated him and I was genuinely happy for him, he kept bringing it up and monopolizing the conversation.

Things got worse when Tom decided to turn the whole celebration into his own spotlight. He started buying rounds of drinks, but instead of just celebrating, he kept making toasts to himself and talking about his promotion, his plans, and his bright future. He even stood on a chair at one point to get everyone's attention to tell some long story about a project at work.

I finally had enough and pulled Tom aside. I told him that while I was happy for him, this night was supposed to be about my birthday, and he was completely taking over. Tom got defensive, accused me of being selfish and jealous, and stormed out of the bar. Now, some of our friends are saying I overreacted and should have just let it go.

4,1dgwgj0,AITA for telling off my girlfriend's parents?,"I (20m) have a girlfriend we'll call Mal (20f). Mal was very sheltered growing up and her parents were very harsh. Her relationship with them was a weird mix being very close and them making her feel awful. Mal is also autistic and they knew that but insisted that her go without extra help for that. I have heard a lot of stories of her growing up and I didn't like them at all. 

When we got together, Mal was 18 and had moved out of her parent's house without them wanting her to. She was really nervous around her family for a while because her moving created a lot of tension. After months of that things were closer to normal again. She and I were very close but she was worried to introduce us as she was sure her parents wouldn't like me. After a while she introduced us and before hand she gave me a list of things not to bring up so that they don't start anything weird. The meeting went ok, no yelling or fighting, but they dont like me and quite frankly I dont like them. Same goes for her sister; Dora (23f) but less so.   
  
Since then, her parents have made it clear they think Mal is being dumb for being with me. They make comments about it sometimes but she defends me whenever they do. She is a lot mousier around them than other people. 

Mal is getting a service dog. She told her her parents about it and her mom was very critical. She told her that having a service dog would be nice but that she shouldn't take advantage of that system as things are getting harder for people who actually need them. Mal I could tell was upset but calmly defended this by talking about her struggles that one would help with. Her mom said that she doesn't need one and that her struggles aren't that bad. Mal doubled down on how much she actually does struggle. They got in a fight with her mom calling her things like a ""spoiled brat.""

I couldn't stand Mal being treated this way. I'd never heard them call her a brat but I had heard them call her stupid. I know they called her worse sometimes when she was younger. I raised my voice but didn't yell. I told them off about everything. I told them off about this, writing off and refusing to address her disability, blaming her for her struggles, sheltering her to a point it was detrimental to her development, calling her names, judging me so much and not accepting us, etc..

They told me to leave now or they would call the police so I left right away, Mal went with me. She just cried all the way to her place. Her parents have been mad at her and I since then.

5,1dgwe4k,WIBTA if I told my Dad Boss that my Mom Boss is cheating on him?,"I’m a nanny. I just found out that the mom I work for has met up with a guy on Ashley Madison. I was sent a post from one of the “are we dating the same guy” facebook pages of a woman describing my mom boss- we’re going to call her Emily- by her name, hair color, car model and color, and identifying the area she lived in. The post asked if anyone knew this woman because her husband was found on ashley madison and admitted to meeting up with her. 

I messaged the author of the post saying that her post was about my boss. She said that her husband said they “met up at a gas station once but left after 10mins” because he felt too guilty. She doesn’t believe him, and doesn’t believe “Emily” was the only girl. I share the same sentiment that if Emily met up with him then he probably wasn’t the only guy she met up with regardless if they did or did not have sex. 

Now about my mom boss, Emily, and my dad boss, Jason. Emily has never liked me. I have watched their kids for a little over 4 years, they have two young kids. The boy is now 12 and the girl is now 4.5 (I started when the baby girl was just months old), and she has shown such a lack of interest; respect; and communication the entirety of my employment. 

From leaving me with the kids for hours after she was supposed to be there with no communication & not answering a number of calls and texts from me; to straight up hostility toward me and outbursts of anger when I told her I had plans and could not work late for trivial things like her going to pick up a new purse. When she would finally show up after 2/3hrs of leaving me with the kids and not answering or not offering any communication, she wouldn’t say a single word to me. No “I’m sorry” or “thank you for staying with them I was held up ___” just got the kids and left. Barely made eye contact with me.  Jason and I have a much better relationship, he is interested in my life and hearing about my opinions, he had great communication and always respects me. Jason is the best father. We share the same parenting opinions and techniques and are always on the same page. He has had to apologize for Emily’s behavior on a number of occasions. 

Emily and Jason have had issues in their marriage and actually separated for a few months. They didn’t tell me anything and I never asked; one day Jason was just not in the house anymore and comments from the youngest kid were “daddy’s never coming home” “daddy’s staying at uncle ____ house”  One night Jason had to pick something up from my house that I had picked up for one of the kids and he told me what was going on. Emily essentially had a mid-life crisis and flipped out on him and her own parents. She stated that she was forced to be someone she wasn’t and she wants to be who she wants blah blah blah. Became very obsessive with Jason and was upset at his and her parents relationship while all of them were just questioning what was going on with her: their daughter and his wife. She dyed her hair to an unnatural “party” color, got tattoos, and was very awful to Jason. I know I only know his side, but knowing Emily for 4 years I believe him. 

This is when I finally told him how I felt that she never liked me around and asked him about those really awful instances of her hostility towards me and leaving me with the kids. He said that she just doesn’t like anyone that’s happy with their lives, and she’s super insecure, she’s an introvert and will never do anything fun with him, and she’s just overall an unhappy person. I’m not sure what happened, but after a few months of separation Jason was back at the house. 

Jason and I haven’t really talked about them or their separation, but we have talked about my life and aspirations and goals and he’s hinted very ominously phrases like “well I’m sure I won’t be here too much longer” ; “well it’s not like I know where I stand” ; “I don’t know what will happen in the next few years..” They are now house hunting for a larger home to move into. 

So there’s the context of my relationship and events with Emily and Jason. I know the meeting between Emily and the poster’s husband was during their separation, but Emily told him she was in an “open marriage” which I know that is not true, nor has ever been true- not even when they were separated. Regardless if she did or didn’t sleep with that guy; regardless if it was just a 10min meeting at a gas station or a full blown affair, I’m sure he wasn’t the only one. He has been put through so much by her, he deserves to know. Jason would absolutely leave my name out of everything. He would never tell her that I told him this stuff. He would say he got the screenshots from another friend or a random person all together. 

I won’t be working with them past this summer as I’m continuing with my education and won’t have the time to continue nannying. WIBTA if I told Jason at all, now or once I’m no longer employed?

7,1dgw8h3,AITA for telling my husband I don't want his daughter going on vacation with us?,"My husband has a 16yo daughter,  Amy, with his ex. She's a huge Disney kid, which I get I was too. We have 2 kids together, Ryan and Ella, 9yo and 2yo.

Amy goes to Disney usually 5 times a year. Twice with her mom, twice with my husband, and her maternal grandparents take her every Christmas break. The younger kids and I have never gone with my husband and Amy as it's a tradition they've had since she was a baby.

We (my husband, me and our 2 kids together) have a trip planned for early August to go to a different theme park for a few days. It was agreed that this would be a just the 4 of us trip as it will be our kids first theme park trip. Initially, my husband said he wasn't inviting Amy as she will have just gotten back from Disney with her mom a few days before. (My husband takes her every year over Thanksgiving and Spring break.)

Whenever we've included Amy in any of our trips, she complains nonstop, it's boring, stupid, useless, she hates it, Disney is better, it's a waste of time, and she has a really pissy mood the whole time. I'm not looking forward to that. I think the 2 younger kids deserve a fun time without Amy basically throwing a tantrum. Last time, we went to a waterpark, Amy got pissy because she wanted Disney again, so she turned off her phone and ran off. We all spent the next several hours looking for her and by the time we found her it was time to go and nobody was able to enjoy the day.

I told my husband I do not want her to go with us and my reasons why. He says I'm being unfair and Amy is still one of the kids and if we're taking out 2 then it's only fair to include Amy. I told him if he insists on Amy going, I'll make other accommodations for myself, Ryan and Ella. He told me I'm being an asshole and try to see how that would make Amy feel.

AITA?

Edit: Amy has said she does not care at all about our trip. We're going to Legoland, not Disney. My husband wants Amy to go with us since he's worried she'll end up regretting it later if she skips it.

Edit2: Amy hates all things Lego. And when I said separate accommodations I meant if Amy goes, I'd book a separate room at the same place for me and the younger ones. My husband can room with Amy and deal with her attitude and behavior. In the past, aside from the waterpark incident, Amy has gotten upset and refused to leave the room which meant we all had to sit in the room all day because it wouldn't be fair for anyone else to go have fun when she's clearly unhappy.

Edit3: the Disney trips are each a full week (7 days) each time with resort stay. 14 days a year with her dad, 14 with her mom, and another 7 with her grandparents.

8,1dgw88u,AITA for not buying my friend a wedding gift?,"My (30F) very close friend (31F) just got married two weekends ago and I was a bridesmaid. Needless to say, being in her bridal party was more expensive than I anticipated (I think more than she anticipated too). We went to Vegas for her bachelorette party a couple months ago, her shower cost $300 per bridesmaid, not to mention the group shower gift between all the bridesmaids, wedding hair, makeup, shoes, dress and alternations. The wedding was in another state so my husband and I had to drive in, book a hotel and pay my MIL for the weekend to watch our daughter and dogs.

Apparently I was wrong. When she got back from her honeymoon she called me to say she just went through all of her wedding gifts and didn’t see one from me and asked if I left it at home. I told her I didn’t buy her anything and that after all I did physically and financially in the bridal party that I didn’t think a gift was a dealbreaker.

He never had one and there is no family history. He was brought to the hospital and was discharged on Friday so they could run tests, observe and consult specialists.

Matt had a lot of visitors including his friends, the vice principal and his 2nd grade teacher from last year.

10,1dgvq99,AITA for being mad my ex basically stole $1200?,"Okay so I (40F) am separated from my husband (47M). I also happen to make a significantly higher income and have continued to help support him financially during the separation (for example, I deposit $4000 a month into his checking account and cover the costs for any shared expenses we still have as the divorce is not final). I have tried to be as amicable as possible for the sake of our kids (17 and 13). 

Our 17 year old son has wanted a “project car” and has been saving up money and had about $1200 saved. He found a car he wanted for a really really good price last week. He was at his dad’s house and called me and I ended up Paypal-ing the guy selling the car $2200 for the car + towing. It turns out the seller has a lot of experience with another type of car that my ex has had sitting and rotting in the driveway for almost a decade and he worked it out with the guy that he would tow it back this car to his shop to fix it up and get it running. 

Anyway I went over to see the car and learned that my son had given the $1200 in cash he had saved to his dad (my ex) who then gave it to the guy to deal with his car. Keep in mind I am the one who paid for the project car for my son with an expectation that I’d be paid back ($1200 and then the rest of it over time from his job). It wasn’t discussed with me that my ex would be handing the cash over to the seller to deal with his other car, so I was a bit annoyed that he did that. 

In asking him about it, I was more or less informed that the money shouldn’t matter to me because I have a high salary and I was being unreasonable and petty. I told him that I feel taken advantage of and that just because I have a good job it doesn’t mean that he is entitled to take $1200 from me without even discussing it. He did a similar thing around Christmas where I paid for something and my son gave him the cash (around $500) and I let it slide. 

So am I the asshole?

He’s been wearing the same skinny jeans for like 8+ years, to the point that they are too tight for him and just out of style. he wears the same black tennis shoes every day, with every single outfit. he doesn’t wear big comfy oversized hoodies, all his hoodies are tight and clearly small for him. a lot of his tshirts have designs that are fading or are just old and super worn but he wears them all the time. any time i suggest getting new jeans or trying new styles like straight leg or something, it’s to no avail. i told him i love how white shoes look and that i think he would look very nice in a pair, he refuses to get a pair or even try any on. i FINALLY managed to get him to the mall to go and try on some outfits, we took about 20 things into the fitting room and we came out of the fitting room with 2 items. all he did in the fitting room was complain, i basically had to wrangle and plead with him to try on new things. he tried on so many shirts that looked so nice on him, but with every single one he would find something to complain about, down to looking at the tag and refusing to buy anything that wasnt 100% cotton. i even offered to pay for half the clothes, thats how badly i want him to just have some new things. We finally got 2 items and he just told me he’s returning the shirt because he decided he didn’t like it anymore. i’m seriously so irritated. my birthday is coming up, his birthday is coming up, i want him to meet my parents and family eventually but i want him to look nice and fashionable when he does. it’s just important to me. i put a lot of effort into my appearance and outfits and its honestly annoying when i try so hard and we go out somewhere nice like a bar or dinner or concert or club, and he wears the same shoes that he wears every day when he goes to school or when he goes hiking to those places. He has a jacket that i love and when he came to visit me once for the weekend i asked him to bring that one because we were going to a nice dinner and i love how it looks in him, and he made it a point to say no and that he wants to bring another jacket. im starting to think he just wants to challenge me and i really don’t know what im supposed to do. i try to meet him in the middle but it seems like that doesn’t even work.",Asshole,2024-06-16,"AITA for trying to get my boyfriend him to wear new clothes/ try new styles?

16,1dhkkns,AITA for asking my Dad for child support ,"Me (f19) and my Dad(m43) never had a good connection. I lived with my Mom(f43) until I was 173/4 and then moved to my Dad. We haven't had contact before that for 2years, I cut it when I was 16. This often happened but never for that long.I gave him a ""second"" chance and hoped for the best. In the beginning everything was great, we talked a lot and took a few little trips together. When I turned 18 he even gifted me a car, a VW 6n bild 2000. (I'll come back to that later) Then about 1month later he asked me to Sign a letter, in which I would be ok with not making him payback his child support Debts, to me. I never really knew what I signed, since his lawyer Advised me. Then everything spiraled down, he would ignore me, wouldn't answer his phone or was annoyed when he did. When he was home at the weekends (he was a truckdriver) he never wanted to spend time with me. Plus he never wanted to help me fix my car, that is just rolling junk. I still love her and she gets me from a to b, but he told me that he fixed everything. Turned out he didn't and I came across serious problems. At that point I told them( him and his wife(f56), the one he cheated with) that I will be moving out the second I have a flat in sight.We didn't fight about that or anything,they just weren't happy about it. We never fought, they'd normally just tell me that I was ""wrong"" in a situation and I would apologise, but my apologies weren't good either. About 2 months later he had a heart attack at work which I only found out about 10h later. He got out weaker but  relatively fine, his heart was not damaged. He of course needs to stop smoking and had/has to change his diet. His wife's son visited.
He didn't want me to visit him, which made me sad and confused but it was his choice, he came home and it was like I wasn't there. Many people came visited only then he would acknowledge me. Before the heard attack, I got a job, so when he went to rehab I started work and lived in the hut at my mom's. After a month trying to call him or to visit him or even getting a text back. I gave up, but my mom asked me too buy groceries and stuff as a ""payment"" for living with her, which I had nothing against,I needed money. I don't know the system in other countries etc. but in Germany the parent were the child stays the most gets the money, if it's half half, the money gets divided. When you turn 18 and have your own place you get the money.At that time I stayed 3 to 4 days a week with her and every second weekend. Although I had a new job I would not be paid until the end of the next month. So I called one more time. He surprisingly answered and we talked a bit, which he didn't sound interested in, so I said: I want to talk about the child support with you. He cut me off and said that they were inspecting it. He started a rant about me apparently ignoring them and being rude to his wife's daughter, who visited. In the end I wasn't even able to explain the situation i was in, my hope to get, not even half off the money was off.It was very confusing. I mentioned that I would always apologise for everything, even things I didn't to wrong and that I never even heard a small sorry from him. I knew it was over when he said that he was going to discuss it with his wife. I said ok and hung up. 30min later his wife texted me saying that if I wanted the child support, I will need too re-register me and my car and that I will need to get my stuff out off there house. After that a lot off things happend but that would make the text way to long. I think I could be TA because I decided to discuss the matter while he was in rehab. Although it was a necessity and couldn't wait, my mom is sick since 2 years, therefore she can't work and is dependent on the little money she gets. It was a hard choice and I told him that I was sorry about the time, it was just a really shitty situation.

17,1dhkflb,AITA for completing a group passion project with friends when a friend couldn’t participate for the completion?,"Hefty title, but it’s a hefty story.

Two friends and I started a fun project over the summer in order to stay in touch. We’ll call one friend Summer (16F), another one Winter (17F) and then there’s me (17F). The project is a book about a bunch of our characters. It’s pretty long so the project was a big deal for us.

One night, Summer and I were writing (it’s a doc where anyone can write) and we were finishing off the ending of our story. We capped it off and went into our group chat to celebrate the completion. At the time, Winter was at a baseball game and couldn’t write. Soon after Summer and I sent the “we finished” message in the group chat, Winter got super angry, angrier than I’ve ever seen her before, and started yelling at both of us, calling herself a terrible writer, a terrible artist and demonizing us for completing the story without her input or waiting for her to be available.

For context, Winter was more of a secondary writer to the book. I wrote a lot of the early chapters, Summer worked on a lot of the middle, and the both of us joined forces to write the ending. On top of that, Winter was not a very adventurous writer. Whenever she wrote, she would only write about her character doing their own thing and not evolving the general plot forward. We called Winter out on her bias towards her character and her defense was that she “didn’t want to mess up their personalities.”

Winter has also been very critical of our writing, constantly pointing out tiny details and how they “don’t fit with her writing style.” I feel bad that she had to be excluded from the final hurrah of our book, but at the same time she has barely participated in the project and used it more as an excuse to her evolve *her* character, nothing more.

18,1dhk89r,WIBTA if I went on a family trip despite the implications of going? ,"I am the oldest of 6 and my younger brother Sam is 19m. We come from a very Christian and conservative family. 

Sam has always sort of been more on the edge. He pierced his ears and got tattoos as a minor and I’ve actually helped him out a few times, more than any of my other siblings at least. 

However, it recently came out that he had an affair of some sort with another guy and it got to my parents. They got so incredibly angry not because their son might be gay or bisexual but because my aunt found out and “snitched” (childish I know) to my bigoted grandmother who funds our yearly summer trip to very expensive and fancy places. 

Now my grandma surprisingly didn’t cut off the entire family, just Sam. She refuses to have him in her house and acts like our house is diseased. She is so dramatic and even says she has 13 grandchildren if someone asks (Sam makes it 14). 

As for the summer trip, my family is still invited except Sam. My dad is refusing to go but my mom insists the rest of us should because apparently grandma will cut us all off as well. Two sisters agree with her and the rest are all waiting for me to decide.

Sam is hoping I won’t go but well I have a 6 year old daughter that has been looking forward to this trip for ages. WhileI love Sam and feel for him, I love my daughter and I don’t want to disappoint her. She’s even packed her little suitcase already. I mentioned this to Sam and he immediately went quiet and now refuses to talk to me. I haven’t even made a decision yet. My dad says he understands but I should teach my daughter a nice lesson while my mom thinks I’m crazy for considering Sam when my daughter is so excited to go. I’m so conflicted but I do want to go on this trip, for my daughter at least.

19,1dhjwyn,WIBTA for not attending my boyfriend's out of town cousin's engagement party ,"I'll start with saying my boyfriend is Indian and family is very important to him where he will drop everything, all plans to do anything his family tells him to. I think his family has a toxic codependent high expectation dynamic that I don't think is fair but whatever. He's the youngest and they act like he has to be their servant and he sees nothing wrong with that. Just some background on my POV of the family, even though they are close knit and he thinks his family is perfect.

Next I'll mention I never have been to an engagement party aside from one I just attended last month. I found out it's part of his culture to have huge celebrations for the engagement of a couple. We got in a fight before I attended this one because he was asking me to drive 2 hours to an engagement party, drive 2 hours home, and then on the next day, drive 2 hours again to a different party and 2 hours back. I didn't want to do this and I wanted to go to one of the two. We fought because I was ""abandoning"" him and not wanting to ""be a part of the family"" when I was just overwhelmed by the lack of being able to have a weekend. Whatever, I went. I was exhausted. Didn't want to go but went to make him happy. 

Now we got in another huge argument because he's expecting me to attend another engagement party in 2 weeks. But this time instead of driving, he wants me to buy a plane ticket and stay overnight. I just had to go to this 2day out of town party 2 weeks ago, then last weekend I had to travel internationally for work, this weekend I had to travel home from the international trip, next weekend I have to move, and he wants me to come to this party the following weekend. It's really stressing me out because I do not want to do this. I want to have one weekend to myself. He's calling me selfish and says that I need to understand that if I want to be a part of his family then this is how I have to be. I have to give up my time for these things or else they will judge me. Because his sisters husband dropped everything to buy a plane ticket and go, that I should too.

It's not even just the high expectations and the amount of stress I've had lately that I just want to relax after all these crazy weekends, but also the fact that I have a cat who I'm worried is going to be anxious / stressed after the move and I don't feel comfortable leaving her alone all weekend just a week after I move to a new place. Also, I'd have to find a brand new pet sitter and pay for one too.

I don't want to do any of this and he's making me feel like a horrible partner because I don't want to come. The only solution is to do as he says.

Her last text on  Father's Day was to tell him ""Thank you for giving me our 2 sons"".....I feel like she always wants to remind me that my husband was hers before she divorced him and that they had a relationship before he married  and btw, she is the one that divorced him long before I met him.  It is so irritating to me.  AITA?   I have blocked her on my phone so I don't have to see her crappy texts if there is a group text regarding grandchildren.",1.0,1.003886580467224,1,1
22,1dhjlyc,AITA for wanting nothing to do w my sisters baby?,"Long story so my apologies. Basically my mother met my step father and he took me on as his own, they then went on to have my sister (A) a year later. My mum died and my step dad kept me as his daughter and then remarried (B) when my sister was 2.

B hated me as I wasn't my dads and look a lot like my mom and eventually talked my dad into kicking me out the house in my mid teens and I went to live w my dads sister and her wife before I went off to college. 10 years later I'm married and have two children, When I was pregnant with my first A was super excited to be an auntie and came to my baby shower and everything, however once my daughter was born she never visited, I offered to go to her, meet her halfway, go do something like coffee date or beach day or something but she was always busy. Same thing happened with my second daughter, A was a no show. We'd message all the time but when I invited her for birthdays or weekends she'd say she was coming then just not show up. Fast forward my children are 8 and 9 years old and have never met their aunt, they don't actually know anything about her, no how are you texts for about 5 years now as I stopped reaching out because she just kept blowing us off. My sister had her baby 4 months ago which I found out via Facebook. I didn't message her because I thought she didn't want anything to do with my kids why should I bother with hers?

I borrowed something from my dads sister and went to drop it off the other day while the kids were at school. My dad, A and B were there with A's baby. I tried to just leave but A cornered me about not congratulating her about the baby or asking how she was doing, and I said why would I you didn't do it for my kids? She blew up at me calling me selfish, I yelled back I don't make a habit of asking after strangers babies and that's what she was to me. My dad said that we were sisters and family is supposed to be there for each other. I'm ashamed to admit I did lose my temper with him and call him a cold hearted bastard and who was he to talk to me about family wearing his no.1 grandpa shirt when he had grandchildren he had never acknowledged?. Where I am probably the asshole is this all happened in my aunts' house and in front of A's baby who was sleeping at the time but still it's not ideal to be screaming in front of an infant.

24,1dhj9tx,AITA for trying to help my girlfriend with assembling a closet but then getting blamed after I crack it?,"Hi Reddit,

first post here, but I have been thinking for a while about posting something regarding my relationship.

I (m29) and my girlfriend (w29) are getting into fights repeatedly because I try to help her with things she can't do. The latest example is that we just moved in together, and my girlfriend bought herself a huge closet for her clothes. Of course, a closet isn't easy to assemble, but I still tried my best to do most of it. Everything went smoothly until we wanted to put all the parts together. We are both not very tall; I'm about 177cm (5'11"") and she is about 152cm (5'0""), so it's hard for us both to do the upper parts. We tried to do it somehow, but it didn't go well. We tried to do it while it was lying down and then we tried to lift it up. We were able to put it together and just needed to lift it up in the end. The problem was that while lifting it up, the back of the closet, which is only a really small and slim piece of wood, got a small crack. It isn't huge, but my girlfriend hates every small mistake on her stuff. She wants it to be perfect without any scratches or cracks. At first, she was, of course, annoyed about it. I tried to find a solution for it and wanted to contact customer support to see if there was a chance of replacing that piece. For me, that was something I would do for her the next day because it was already late. I didn't really say too much about the incident afterward. After a few hours, she came out of the bathroom super mad at me, saying that I don't care about her stuff and that it's in my blood to sabotage her (This comes from previous fights where I tried to do things for her and also unintentionally damaged something or made a mistake). I know that I can be clumsy, but I really try to be careful with the things I do. Maybe not always to the same level as her, but I try my best. Also, a similar thing happened to a smaller closet of hers where, sadly, something also had a small crack because I let it fall down as I couldn't hold it anymore while assembling. But back to the story today. She is also super mad because I didn't say sorry until now and that it seems like, because I didn't mention it at all anymore, that I don't care about it. For me, it was clear that I would contact customer support tomorrow, which is why I didn't really say anything more about it. She also said to me that now, after it happened, it is too late. I should have told her in advance that I couldn't build it up instead of trying and then breaking or doing something wrong while trying. 

So, am I the asshole for cracking a part of my girlfriend's closet while assembling it after she asked me to build it up?

If there is more information needed I'm of course willing to give it to you.

Have a good one 👍


Edit:

I still give a bit more information that might be helpful:

I just checked and I'm also more like 5""9' to 5""10'. Doesn't change too much just fyi.
After the last time I put a crack into her closet she said I should ask her for help the next time if we build something up again and I also did. While assembling the parts together we were there together and also were thinking about how to do it and also bounced some ideas back and forth. 
The situation happened out of an idea of her that we should lay down the closet because we're both not tall enough to really put on the top part. We did and after we were able to be in the position to bring it up we tried to lift it up. I did mainly the lifting because it's heavy of course and then it happened.

Also I said in my text that I'm not as careful about stuff. This is more related to cleaning, arranging stuff and putting stuff in order because I didn't do it too much before I met her and she grew up where everything has to be in order without exceptios. I struggled to adapt to that but of course made progress about it but it's still not on the same level as for her.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-16,"AITA for trying to help my girlfriend with assembling a closet but then getting blamed after I crack it?

26,1dhiw04,AITA for giving my dad the silent treatment first? And now he’s giving me silent treatment ,"
I’m currently studying for MCAT and I’m already super stressed out about it. In order to ease this stress, I told myself I would take one full day off each week from studying so I can enjoy and do whatever I want. 

My dad was extremely supportive with this idea. On my break day, I hung out with my family or go on walks. It was great. 

Until 2 days ago, when I told him I was going for a picnic with a friend on my break day.
 
His exact words were “why are u going out? You should studying instead of taking break. You need to put your head down for the next 4 months. You can’t have fun”.  

I’m sorry what?? He was literally so supportive with the idea that I should be taking breaks and in fact encouraging me. But when I mentioned I was going to hangout with a friend, he was upset about it??? I was extremely upset and didn’t talk to him and went to my room. 

This is one thing I dislike about my dad. He’s the most emotionally inconsistent person I’ve ever known. One day he’s all supportive and wants the best for me. But if I do something he doesn’t like, he’s extremely discouraging and manipulative. I’ve told him multiple times how I hate when he’s inconsistent.

I didn’t talk to him yesterday because I was still upset and he didn’t try bother talking to me, prolly cause I decided to hangout with my friend and against his wishes. 

Today is Father’s Day and so I decided to wish him happy Father’s Day because I didn’t want him to feel bad . But my man just ignored me and didn’t say anything back and so he’s giving me the silent  treatment.

I know silent treatment is a form of abuse and I definitely should have communicated my feelings the day off the argument but my dad is not the type of person communicate well. He thinks he’s always right even if he’s in the wrong.and so so I decided there’s litterly no point expressing my feelings

27,1dhisj3,AITA for removing my mom from being able to see my location on find my iphone?,"My very religious mormon mom (50) has always been overprotective and has been constantly and obsessively checking my location since I (18)F have had a phone. Even going to the extent of texting me if I was at a location I hadn’t informed her I would be going to. She does this to my siblings as well and my older brother (21) even had to remove her from seeing his location for doing the same to him.  

 A couple weekends ago my long distance boyfriend (21) of 2 months came to visit and house sit for his older brother. He asked me if I wanted to hang out with him all weekend and spend the night there so of course I said yes. That night we were awoken at 2:30 am to a call from my mom asking where I was and why I wasn’t at my apartment. I told her I was spending the night with my boyfriend (who they have met before) and that it’s the middle of the night so why was she even looking at my location. She said she couldn’t sleep, and she had a strong urge to check my location. She told me that I needed to go home immediately because it was inappropriate for me to be having a sleepover with my boyfriend. We argued on the phone for a couple of minutes until I finally agreed to go home. I didn’t drive there so my boyfriend had to drive me home 15 minutes away.

 I am 45 minutes away from my parents at college and I am an adult, so I didn’t think I needed to ask permission to sleep somewhere other than my apartment. 2 days later I told my therapist about the situation. She suggested that after everything she’s heard about my mom, the best thing for me to do, would be to remove my mom from the list of people who could see my location. That way she couldn’t obsess over it, and I could live my life without that stress. 

I didn’t tell my mom what I was doing and the next day she asked me why she couldn’t see my location and I told her about the conversation with my therapist. She got very upset and said she has a right to see my location for safety reasons and I told her that everyone else in the family has access to it, and if there was ever an emergency she could ask my dad. She keeps saying that it’s disrespectful of me to do this to her after all she does for me and continues to bring it up still 3 weeks later.

To be fair, my parents are paying for my education, and they are helping with part of my rent. But does that give them the right to still have a say in everything I do and the way I want to live my life? I’ve talked to my dad and he said he understands that my mom can be a little obsessive, but she just loves and cares about me and my safety.

28,1dhim69,AITA for yelling at my ex friends for outing me 2x?,"I, 15f got outed last year and the people who did it are trying to bring it all back. 
For a little bit of context, I dated a girl last year and we had a messy breakup. A mutual friend of ours told my ex that I had been talking shit about her, saying that she should harm herself and that I never liked her at all. This same mutual friend told our entire grade that I dated woman about my sexuality, and my ex wouldn’t talk to me. Eventually me and my ex talked and worked out what had happened. We parted ways on good terms and both dropped this mutual friend we had that turned out to be extremely toxic and manipulative. (another story for another day)

Recently, a friend of mine was at my ex girlfriend’s birthday party, and they were all talking about drama and such. My ex girlfriends SISTER decided to bring up what had happened the year prior, saying I was a bully and saying that I was wrong for stopping being friends with the girl who outed me and spread many rumors. My friend there told me, and I confronted my ex girlfriends sister over text, telling her that I knew she was talking about it, and that I didn’t want to get outed AGAIN and that I didn’t appreciate her being back all of this over a year later and outing me again.

We went out last night to Topgolf with my wife's direct family for Father's day. It was My wife and I, her brother (21M), her sister (21F) and her dad. There are five of us total. We booked a bay for 2 hours. The bay was a flat rate that could accommodate 1-6 players. The price would be the same whether you had 1 player or 6 players. 

This was a father's day gift for my wife's dad so we were making sure he did not have to pay anything. My wife's sister booked the place and put everything on her card so we could split it up after the fact. We had a great time. 

However, after my wife and I got home, we got a text from her brother and sister with the bill. 

Total Bill - $140

Brother's portion - $35

Sister's portion  - $35

My wife and I's portion  - $70   (+$6 for the two sodas we ordered which makes sense. I did not include the drinks in the total.)

  
Their reasoning was that we would split the check four ways since there are four of us. Which does not seem fair since my wife and I are together. We think the check needs to be split 3 ways.

40,1dhgta0,AITA for not inviting my father to my graduation even if my mom wants me to?,"For my college graduation (I’m an undergrad) I initially invited my mom, sister, and close friends. There is a limited amount of tickets and each attendee must have a ticket to enter. I was close with my dad as a kid but we started arguing more as I grew into a teenager. I was in high school when we had completely stopped talking to each other. Now we ignore each other. My dad is emotionally uninvolved with my life, and the only thing he does now is occasionally hand cash to my sister to give it to me (he won’t directly give it to me himself). Due to our relationship, I didn’t plan on inviting my father. 

Later I got a call from my mom telling me how my dad, who lives with us but I haven’t spoken to in about 5 years, wants to attend my graduation. So she plans to take him and my sister to go see me. I told her that I already invited my friends and do not have a ticket reserved for him, nor do I want him to go. My mom was appalled that I had prioritized my friends over our family, and told me all the things my dad would do to raise me when I was a child. She told me to forgive him, and that him wanting to come to my graduation is his effort in trying to reconcile the relationship. She said my graduation is the chance to mend our family back together. However I told her that I still feel uncomfortable with my dad all of a sudden trying to come back when he had all the previous years to try. 

My mom does not understand and has been crying. She tells me that the reason my father and I don’t get along is because we do not know how to forgive. She told me she has forgiven him after their divorce but stayed together so the kids could see both parents in one household. So I should learn to forgive him for the sake of mending our family. She tells me that I’m the one causing the issue, since my father is trying to see me graduate.

I told my mom that I wasn’t going to extend an invite to my father, and asked her if she would still come to my graduation. My mother said “I don’t know” and hung up on me. AITA?

49,1dhfpau,AITA for kicking my bridesmaid out of my wedding after she’d already bought her dress?,"AITA for kicking my bridesmaid out of my wedding after she’d already bought her dress?

Four years ago, during lockdown, my now-husband and I got engaged. I asked my best friend, Marie, to be a part of our special day. Everything was going smoothly—we went dress shopping, and she bought her bridesmaid's dress. 

Due to the ongoing lockdown, I planned a small hen party at a local pub. Marie was incredibly helpful, taking me to pick up food and storing it in her larger kitchen. On the day of the hen party, I decorated the room, and Marie dropped off the food. I paid for both of us to have our hair and makeup done and was excited for the evening.

That night, I thanked Marie for all her help. However, while I was in the restroom, I overheard her complaining to my husband's family. She claimed she had paid for everything, done all the decorating, and paid for our hair and makeup, calling me ungrateful and saying she wouldn’t be around me if she had the choice.

I chose not to confront her then, not wanting to ruin the night. Later, I found Marie outside, crying. When I asked what was wrong, she said the venue upset her because it reminded her of my grandad's wake. I was furious—Marie never knew, met, or spoke to my grandad. I felt she was trying to ruin my night.

The next morning, calmer and sober, I confronted her. I explained that her lies and bringing up my grandad to upset me were too much. I told her I no longer wanted her in the wedding, offered to refund her the money for her dress, and asked to leave it at that. She reacted awfully, she denied the whole thing claiming she didn’t say anything, when I told her I heard the whole thing she went off her head calling me a spoilt bitch and a ungrateful person and told me she never liked me in the first place, we haven’t spoken since.

50,1dhff6y,AITA for taking a raincheck on my stepdad’s family reunion?,"A few months ago my mom got a plane ticket as a “gift” for me to go to Boston for my stepdad’s family reunion from 6/20-6/25. Work stuff came up and I can only go from 6/21-6/24. Starting yesterday, I apologized profusely and said if she cancels or changes it I’ll repay her. She’s still livid

Unlike her, I understand that life happens.

Back in like October or whatever when she made the tickets I was able to go on those days because we were fully staffed. Ever since then we’ve had some people quit actually very recently and unexpectedly. We are now understaffed and I just stepped into the new role of assistant manager of the store just a few weeks ago and I’m now needed more badly, so I can’t take off as much until we find replacements and train them sufficiently. I tried explaining this to her, but she just said my boss is being cheap, take the full range days off anyways, and he won’t fire you don’t worry, if anything, he’ll appreciate you more after you come back, etc. I’m the child but it feels like I’m dealing with a child here.

And you know how awkward it is being the red headed stepchild at a family reunion where literally no one there is even your family? I’ve been to like three of them for my stepdad already. I really don’t want to go regardless, but I’m reluctantly willing to suck it up and go over a long weekend.

Continuing into today, I keep getting chewed out

My mom and stepfather are so toxic, it’s just unbelievable. 

Even after I gave them my good reason, they still attacked it. Heck, even if I didn’t have a good reason, it’s completely unnecessary for my mom to say I break promises, have bad behavior, being passive aggressive saying my boss is more important than your own mother, what you are doing to your own mother is total bs, I don’t know how I’ll ever get over this, you are disrespectful and untrustworthy, I’m dissapointed in how you’ve lived your life, you are stuck, then she starts attacking my dad who has nothing to do with this. 

Then my stepdad says I have no character, I’m a coward, my word is meaningless, I’m pathetic, this will take a lot for me to overcome, you are disinvited from any future events, and a backstabber.

Then my stepdad wanted me to come over to talk. What? so he can verbally abuse me in person? No thanks.

And all this after i have apologized profusely, given a reason, offered to reimburse my mom if she could change the travel dates, and if she couldn’t, I’d reimburse her for the plane ticket she bought me. 

Again, I felt genuinely bad at first, but now I just feel anger after they kept relentlessly berating me.

And berating me is one thing, but bringing my dad into this who has nothing to do with this in order to trash him is just a whole other level.

My mother(60) and brother(24) in law were told in October 2023 that they need to move out where they were living end of December 2023. My wife tried to help them then to sort it out, but it was told to her to, “mind her own business.” 

Fast forward to early Jan 2024, they end up on the street for 1 night in which my wife decides to fetch them and take them to places she organised for them for 2 weeks. 2 weeks later, they end up on our couch saying they will be out by end of January. 

They do not have jobs, which obviously means no stable income. My MIL does random massages and my BIL does not work. So our expenses doubled and they don’t bat an eye.

End of January comes long and they cannot move out and there is no desire to look for work and both of them just sit on the couch 95% of the day. After multiple conversations, arguments and disagreements and them making excuses, my BIL gets a job end of April and my MIL is still just sitting.

Currently, I am thinking about moving out cause I am done with this. But I gave them till the end of June to pack their bags and leave.

60,1dhdmh4,AITA for not dragging my sister along to a convention?,"I (18 f) was recently invited to my town's annual convention (similar to comicon) by a handful of cosplayer friends. I don't typically do that kind of stuff, but I figured it would be fun. Well, when I ran the idea by my mom she immediately responded with ""Sounds like fun! You'll be taking your sister, right?"" My sister (14 f) and I aren't distant by any means. We share a room, and are generally pretty tight. But it was an impossible situation. See, even though I do enjoy her company, I felt that dragging her along would be awkward for all parties involved. My friends are seniors in highschool (some are even freshman in college!), and while they wouldn't be unkind to her, I'm not sure how well they would mesh with this random, 14 year old girl. And vis versa-my sister is VERY socially awkward, and I genuinely don't think she would enjoy herself because she'd spend the entire convention loitering in the back silently panicking. EVEN FURTHER STILL I am friends with a large and diverse pool of people, and I am very...weary...of mixing friend groups. Case in point, I did not have an 18th birthday party because I feared the potential repercussions of gathering all of my friends into a room (Irrational? Maybe, but I nervous that they wouldn't get along). Which is all to say: the reason I was apprehensive of agreeing to take my sister along was NOT because I was embarrassed of her. But my mom seemed to interpret my silence this way, and started to go off on me IN FRONT OF MY SISTER about how selfish I was, and how ""some siblings didn't hate each-other,"" and how I was only ever looking out for ""number one"" (denoting myself). I tried to deescalate the situation by reassuring my sister that no, I didn't ""hate her"" and proposing that maybe we could go together separately (the convention is multiple days long), but my sister was already in tears. I'm not sure how to navigate this. If I decide to go with my friends, my mom will guilt-trip me for weeks; if I take my sister, no one will have a good time; and if I take my sister separately, she'll think it's because I'm embarrassed to be seen with her.

61,1dhd1jr,AITA for refusing to dress modestly when my roommates has a girl over for dinner?,"I \[F24\] have two roommates I'll call Steve\[M23\] & John\[M24\] that I've lived with for about two years now.  We all get along and the only life difference is that the two of them are both fairly religious and attend church every week together. I grew up religious but took issue with the church for a lot of reasons, particularly with me coming out as gay. They have no issues with that and Steve even went to Pride in our city with me so I wouldn't have to go by myself.

Recently John began to talk to this girl on a catholic dating app and they seem to have hit it off. I've asked John if he'll be inviting her over and that I'd love to meet her if he's comfortable with it. He shrugged it off the couple times I casually brought it up but earlier today  he asked if we could chat. He basically asked if I would ""dress and act more modestly"" if he brings the girl he's been seeing over for dinner.

He said he didn't think it was appropriate for me to be wearing cropped shirts and ripped jeans if we're having guests over. I pressed him on it since we've had plenty of friends and even family over with no issue. All John kept saying was that he really liked her and wanted to make a good impression with his living space and didn't want her to think he was living with people ""that didn't present themselves appropriately"".

I asked him if it was because I was gay and he hurriedly denied it and just said that as a 24-year-old woman I should dress more modestly when having company over. He wasn't even inviting me to the dinner they were making, I was just going to be home. My usual weekend outfit is a cropped band tee with a sports bra underneath and high waisted jeans that have some rips from mid-thigh to mid-calf.  There's no more than 3-4 inches of exposed skin of my stomach. 

I told him absolutely not and that I wasn't changing how I dressed in my own home and that it was rude of him to ask. I stood up to go and John then asked if I could just not be around Saturday evening. My response was: ""Fuck that, I'll wear whatever the hell I want and god can smite me for all I care."" I just left him sitting there and went upstairs to my room. This request has come out of nowhere and it just doesn't sound like John talking.

That was yesterday and I've since heard from Steve that the girl is coming over on Saturday. He also mentioned that John had asked him to invite me out with him for drinks so he could have the place to themselves that night. Steve doesn't seem to know about John and I's conversation.

John has just been giving me the silent treatment and Steve is now asking me if I want to hit a couple bars Saturday night with his cousin. Which I don't feel against but I hate the way John is trying to just get me out of the house now. I feel petty and want to just stay home but I know that's dumb. I've always had an ok relationship with John and I'm starting to feel bad for how I acted and am wondering if I'm making this into too big of a thing.

62,1dhd0ux,AITA for telling my cousin off for being a wild animal to my grandpa’s birthday party?,"I feel like I'm losing it here.

I (30f) grew up with strict values, especially when it came to table manners and how we present ourselves. Our family has always been the one to host gatherings and big family get-togethers, putting a lot of effort into making them special. This time, it was my Grandpa's 85th birthday, and we were excited to go all out.

I spent hours decorating, Mom was busy contacting people and cooking up a storm, and Dad spared no expense to make sure everything was perfect.

Now, my cousin Jane (22f) has had a tough time growing up because her parents were never quite stable — dealing with drinking problems and even incarceration. Mom has always felt sorry for her and sees Jane almost like one of her own. Because of this, Mom tends to cut Jane some slack that she wouldn't for anyone else.

Jane herself is a bit unconventional, and I don't blame her given her rough upbringing. She recently started dating someone and they adopted this ""marmoset monkey"" named Nips together. What bugs me isn't so much Jane's choices but rather that she insists on bringing Nips everywhere — including our house.

My mom used to have strict rules about animals indoors. She wouldn't even allow a big dog inside because she thought it was unhygienic. Yet, when it comes to Jane and Nips, suddenly all rules seem to fly out the window. Mom finds Nips adorable and can't help but coo over her whenever Jane brings her around, even at special events.

Jane originally couldn't make it to Grandpa's birthday because she had another commitment — which honestly gave me some relief. But then Jane shows up later, saying the other event got postponed due to the host being sick. And of course, she brings Nips along.

Mom doesn't scold Jane like I expected. Instead, she starts fussing over Nips and showing her off to everyone, including Grandpa, who clearly looks uncomfortable with the whole situation.

I lost it. I couldn't hold back and asked Jane why on earth she thought it was appropriate to bring a monkey to Grandpa's birthday. She looked confused, saying she always brings her along. I told her it was disrespectful and she should've left Nips at home. Jane started crying, apologized, and left.

Mom was furious with me, saying I ruined her efforts to make Jane feel welcome in our family. Grandpa looked really sad after Jane left, and now I'm stuck feeling like the bad guy.

Everyone seems to think I overreacted, but seriously, who in their right mind brings a monkey to a family event?

Our kid also isn’t a “bad” kid. She does what she’s told, picks up after herself, and so on. We usually just have to threaten timeout one time when she’s misbehaving and she corrects her behavior. She is very very rarely ever “in trouble”.

64,1dhc8pj,AITA for butting into a conversation my husband was having with his friend?,"I (36F) need some perspective on a situation that happened recently.

A little backstory: My husband (37M) and his online friend are both artists and decided to make a game. Since they are new to game development and coding, my husband planned to learn the coding part. I loved this idea and decided I'd also like to learn, but separately from them because we like very different games. I've already started an online course to learn the basics.

Now when this all happened, we were both at our computers. I was doing some research on my laptop while my husband was casually chatting online with his friend about their project. At one point, my husband started complaining about coding and how much he had to learn on his own. That's when I chimed in with some encouragement, I said something like, ""Learning to code will take time, don't put too much pressure on yourself. It's a passion project, work on it at your own pace.""

My husband muted his mic, got defensive, and asked me why I was butting into his conversation. I said I was just trying to be supportive. He replied that he was talking to his friend, not me. I said, ""You are right,"" I got up and I took my laptop with me to the other room. He then said as I was leaving that he wasn't trying to be ""funny"", I said he was right, I was butting in and I'm sorry. He went back to his conversation, and I felt hurt, dismissed and confused. I was just trying to be supportive, especially since I've already started learning to code by myself and wanted to encourage him to start.

Me adding my two cents every now and again has never been a problem before, so why all of a sudden is it not okay now? Now I'm wondering if I was wrong to chime in.

66,1dhbxxq,AITA for not being grateful for my birthday surprise ,"I have been crying for hours yesterday and today, receiving texts on how I am ungrateful. This shit just doesn't make sense to me. I am trying to see the good intentions, but call me blind because I don't see any.

I have never had a birthday party or dinner, and it is something that I have always wanted, but I don't know why I always thought it was unattainable in my adult life. I was talking to my friend and telling her how my family never celebrates birthdays because my dad is really religious and how I always feel lonely on my birthday. She asked me why I didn't celebrate my birthday now that I was an adult, and I thought, Yeah, why don't I celebrate myself now that I am grown? I planned myself a birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant and told everyone that as long as they kept their order under $35, I would pay for it. So I made sure to work overtime for 3 months in advance because I heard there is always a fight about the bill, so I didn't want that to be a reason for conflict on my birthday. I invited 12 people that said they would come (family and friends, which include my mom now that my dad is dead; she is no longer super religious for some reason). 

Yesterday I had my nails, makeup, and hair done professionally. I just wanted to look really nice, and I have actually only been to formal events like three times in my life, so I was happy to be able to dress up nicely for once. I got to my dinner, sat at my table, and waited 2 hours, and I kept getting calls from people, telling me they were running late to not being able to come anymore. And after 2 hours,, everyone finally told me they were not coming.. They didn't tell me before the dinner; they were all telling me at the time of reservation or later. The waiter felt so bad because I was crying while I was on the phone with someone I considered to be my friend, telling me she wasn't coming for me and that even though I didn't order a meal, he gave me a free birthday slice. I didn't even get any pictures in my outfit because I thought someone would help take them for me at the restaurant, and by the time I left the restaurant, my makeup was ruined.

My mom called me on my way home and asked me to stop at her house because she had a present for me. She says she is sorry she didn't come, but she was feeling extremely unwell, and she wanted to have a present at least. I go to her house, and I open the door to a surprise, and people see that my face was messed up because I had been crying, so someone says, ""Aww, she thought we forgot her,"" and I look at the 12 people that were invited to my dinner and am just disappointed that they traded what I wanted for my birthday for this. They left me stranded and humiliated at a restaurant for hours. I left the surprise party after 5 minutes and just told my mom to keep her present to herself.

72,1dhacpa,AITA for not choosing my Best Friend?,"I (15 F) have a best Friend (13 F), let's call her Clara, and I got a friend (14 M), let's call him Theo, with whom I'm really close, since we grew up together. I see him as my cousin. Theo has a disability, with which he learns much slower than the other kids. With that being in the 8th Grade he's learning stuff from 3rd Grade. 

So this Wednesday Theo called me, asking if he could come over to talk about his problems. I told him that I didn't have time that day and that we could meet up this Friday (just come over, not sleep over). He agreed. As I said I have a best friend, Clara. We always hang out together with Theo so I decided to ask her to come on Friday. She also agreed. On Thursday she asked if she could sleep over at my place and I said ok. 

Later that day Clara texted me saying her mom allowed her to come, but under one condition. “That strange boy won't be there”. Clara also told me that she herself didn't want him there on Friday. I asked her why. She said because he always grabs and touches her and that Theo annoys her. This made me angry. 
Clara often wears revealing clothes so no wonder. But that's not it. She always gets into physical fights with Theo and these Fights are the only times he touches her. At least that's what I see.
I told her that I promised Theo first so he's going to come over. She didn't like that and told me that she was my best friend and that I should always pick her, that that's Theo’s problem and that I've hurt her feelings. Then I blocked her. 

After some time Theo texted me saying Clara wants to apologize and to give her a chance. That's what I did. I unblocked her. She started saying that we should both just apologize. Me for not choosing her and Clara for “excluding” Theo and that she's the one who should be angry. I said no and then she sent me a voicemail in which she was crying and saying that she just wanted to do something with me. Just the two of us without Theo, because he's always with us, but she never said anything like this before, so I think it's an excuse. 

I said that I promised Theo first. She said that that’s not fair and that I should let her sleep over or that I should sleep at her house. I just responded that I would never again come to her house, because it feels like being in prison. Her parents are really strict and they're always acting rich. They are rich, they live in a big house, they have a lot of money and so on. I told her that and she said that we're just poor and that my mom is not trying to keep me safe in comparison to her mom. Her mom made a rule - no boys dating or as friends. We argued a little more and then I blocked her. 

Theo is very sweet and caring. After I blocked Clara and told Theo about what's happened, he asked me if he would go to jail if Clara did something to herself. He also said that he's sorry, that he wants us to be friends and that Clara should come over instead of him. I haven't talked to Clara since.

I just responded that I would never again come to her house, because it feels like being in prison. Her parents are really strict and they're always acting rich. They are rich, they live in a big house, they have a lot of money and so on. I told her that and she said that we're just poor and that my mom is not trying to keep me safe in comparison to her mom. Her mom made a rule - no boys dating or as friends. We argued a little more and then I blocked her. 

Theo is very sweet and caring. After I blocked Clara and told Theo about what's happened, he asked me if he would go to jail if Clara did something to herself. He also said that he's sorry, that he wants us to be friends and that Clara should come over instead of him. I haven't talked to Clara since.

73,1dha1cv,AITA for not telling my kids to be quiet even when it’s just me around them? ,"Background - 

I am in a LTR and living with my girlfriend. 

I am a father of 2 teens and they do not primarily live with us.

When they come over my GF has really struggled with them being in here.  I’ve tried to do whatever I can to accommodate both sides, and it’s honestly exhausting sometimes. 

This week both kids have been staying with us for the summer.  

My GF loves the normal quiet and finds that them being in the house to be disruptive.  IMO, they are not generally loud kids but I know as their parent I’ve grown to tolerate a base level of noise that my GF has not.  

To her, they stomp, chew too loudly, open and close too many doors too loudly, talk at high volumes and especially use their devices too loudly.

Example, my kids have phones, and watch videos on their phones, mostly at low volume or with headphones but if they are alone, sometimes just at normal volume.

She corrects them, and asks them to mute it or wear headphones when out in a shared space (or even lower the volume when they are in another room but it’s still audible). 

The thing is it bothers her, but not me.  So when she’s not around, I don’t correct that kind of behavior the way she would if she was there.  I literally don’t care if they want to listen to music in the living room because I like it too. 

I want everyone to get along, and I want her to feel comfortable.  But she’s asking me to make parenting choices I otherwise don’t agree with.  She says that by not doing that, I don’t support her.  She says that we aren’t presenting a unified front, and that it isolates her as the “controlling” one and makes me seem like the “fun” parent. 

So am I the asshole for not telling my kids to be more quiet when it’s just us in the house?

74,1dh9zys,AITA for leaving my partner’s family reunion without warning after he (33m) failed to tell me (33f) we were having professional family photos taken?,"**Context:** As you can imagine, this is not the first time he’s failed to tell me pertinent information about the activity at hand. We’ve had countless conversations about discussing the details ahead of time. When similar situations have happened, he has completely failed to take accountability and instead blames me for being inflexible, controlling, etc.

**Background:** About 6 weeks ago, I had a major life change back home (different state) that has required me to travel 4 weekends in a row. This past Monday, I flew back from my home state and then traveled 4 hours round trip to a neighboring city on Thursday and Friday for a work training. When I arrived back on Friday, there was a safety situation at the office that required me to remain at work until 9pm to have the locks changed. Essentially, I was absolutely exhausted by Friday night.

**Situation:** My partner was able to leave Thursday evening for his family reunion (at the lake) and we agreed that I would meet him there on Saturday. On Saturday, I made the 2 hr drive and arrived to the reunion around 1:30pm.

About an hour into being there, I hear one of his cousins say that she has to “get out and go get ready for dinner.” I look to my partner and ask, “We’re going to dinner tonight?” Another cousin hears me and elaborates that we are also having professional family photos taken at dinner.

Because we are at the lake, I have only packed athleisure wear and swim suit cover ups. I have no make up, no hair tools, and nothing to wear. I also have long, curly hair- even a “wash and go” style takes planning because my hair stays wet for hours. His sister tries to reassure me but literally NO ONE wants to be unprepared for professional photos with their in-laws at a family reunion.

I am simply unable to recover. I let him know that I have only packed 1 dress (that is very, very obviously a swimsuit cover up) and he, in a group conversation with his family, attempts to encourage me to wear that cover up for the pictures.

I leave the dock and walk back to where we are staying. After taking a shower and sorting through my thoughts, I ultimately decide that I will not be attending dinner or pictures. At 4:30pm, his mom knocks on the door and lets him know it is time to leave to make it on time for 5:00pm pictures. I let him know I will not be going and he immediately gets upset with me and insinuates I am being unreasonable. In that moment I privately decide I will be leaving the reunion altogether once he goes to dinner.

I wait for him to leave, pack my stuff and drive back home. He is very upset with me and sends a text saying, “I am really hurt you left.” We have not spoken since and are in a standoff about the whole thing.

So, am I the asshole for leaving my partner’s family reunion after he failed to prepare me for professional family photos?

**ETA:** We have been together almost 4 years. We are not married but our lives are fully integrated (mortgage, family, friends, investments, etc.) He has a lovely family and I have a good relationship with all of them. I packed essentials for the trip, like sunscreen/shampoo/soap. If dinner and photos were not taking place, no one there would have worn make up or styled their hair. It seems everyone has a different take on what *Lake Weekend* means, but for us it means laid back and dressed down. Emphasis on casual.

To everyone who has at least acknowledged my frustration, thank you.

For the rest, there is no winning with a lot of the feedback. My options are either that I am a drama queen for leaving and therefore pretentious, self-absorbed, and overly concerned about my appearance OR that I should have packed make-up, hair tools, and a photoshoot worthy outfit without knowing any of the plans to SWIM AT THE LAKE. You can see how this is impossible right?

I didn't leave because I was worried about looking perfect in the pictures, I left because I did not feel respected by my partner.

76,1dh9p50,AITA for not going on scout meetings?,"I am broken and maybe I did something wrong but I just can't get this off my mind.

I (18F) had been a scout for 8 years now. I became an assistant leader of the Cub scouts for 4 years. Two years ago our scoutmaster left the function due to pregnancy and the other assistant leader came in her place, becoming one.

I always believed I was a good assistant leader. I love the kids, and the kids loved me. I am always kind to them, they can always talk to me, and I always calm them down whenever they cry. I always did fun activities with them and helped the Scouts leader as much as I could.

Throughout this year I wasn't really on with the scout life, as I had to make drivers license, I had ending exams in my music school and I had a professional qualifying examination in my school, which all drained my energy a lot. On the top of it, my grandparents died this year. I wasn't there more than I was.

I always asked the other scouts what's going on around our team, how are the kids, I always greeted the Cub scouts whenever I could and they greet me back with a smile.

Today I had a meeting with the Scoutmaster, telling me all my mistakes I did this year. They told me I didn't care about the kids and all of my actions have consequences. I feel like they are punishing me for having more important things to do. They told me I could write an appeal to it in 14 days and I could still attend Scouting meetings if I wanted.

I do say I am in a bit of fault because I always told our scoutmaster that I won't be there last minute, and I'm not denying my inability to organize time.

I am not sure what to do. I love those kids, but I just can't bare how I got treated. I am not sure if this is my fault, I'm not saying I'm not in fault here, but I just think the way I got treated was unfair towards me. I don't know if I should let the passion for taking care of those kids or the pain from the decision take me. I don't want to stop my scouting life, but I can't see any other option.

She's been in therapy for years and has really improved over the past few years. The one thing that hasn't improved is that nights are hard for her and she needs very specific things to be able to fall asleep. 

She needs every window in the apartment to be closed and locked, our bedroom door has to be locked, she checks the entire apartment 1-2 times before going to sleep to make sure everything is how she needs it. The light has to be on and she needs a fan and a heated blanket. From there there can't be any loud noises. We don't have anything on the bed or where it can be expected to accidentally make a noise and we have sound dampening curtains outside our window because if there's any loud noise she'll wake up and I'll have to check the apartment, closets and everything, and convince her that she's safe and can go back to bed. Even with all of this she still has nights where she wakes up screaming or has nightmares so bad that she vomits. 

We stayed with my family a few months ago and it was horrible. I explained all of this to my mom and she assured me the doors and windows have locks, they can keep the windows closed at night while she's there, they'll make sure there's no loud noises at night, and they have a fan she could use. 

It was horrible. None of the doors or windows locked, there was no fan, my sister was not quiet at night, and they complained about the light so much that we turned it off.

79,1dh8ns5,AITA for telling my twin that she uses me as a sound board for her physical issues to much? ,"I will try to make this as condensed as possible. I(30nb) have a twin (30f) who was diagnosed w/ POTS, EDS & Mass cell activation in the last few weeks.I noticed a pattern of her bringing up her medical stuff to me almost once a day, if not more. I have been trying to be understanding/patient, provide non judgemental feedback and don't catastrophe. Usually I say stuff like  ""I'm glad you found a doctor that you like/listen to you"", ""everyone has different limits"", ""rest, you need it"" or I go over the best case scenario if she has blood work she wants me to look at. Admittedly, I work in a high intensity eating disorder unit which may contribute to her feelings of frustration towards me. I thought I was being good at being supportive. Tho I am sure there is truth in her stating I come off as annoyed even if I don't try to show it. Also was under the impression I was doing well at it as she keeps coming to me. 

Well it all came to a hault at my mom's bday dinner. She ate acidic foods at the movie theater, & had a huge sugary margarita at dinner. This gave her horrible heart burn. She walked away from dinner. I went to check on her a few times and she finally just asked to chill in my car (I drove us there). When we went outside she was screaming in my back seat. I was surprised and looked at her and stated ""why did you order and finish that huge drink dummy"". I now realize it was not the best thing to say, and it did not come off as a light hearted joke. She snapped at me and yelled ""YOU NEVER F""ING BELIEVE ME WHEN IM IN PAIN"" in front of the whole family. I was taken back/hurt. I even have given her money to help with doctors vistes. At that point I told her to get her feet in the car and stop screaming. My tone was not gentle by any means at this point. I stated I will take you to the ER. But you have to stop yelling or I can't drive you (it's not safe). I told her someone will probably call the cops or ambulance if you can't/I will if you can't and are in that much pain. We are finally heading to the local ER & She suddenly is able to stop yelling & states it's just heart burn, she just wants to go home. So I take her to the gas station. Let her go to the bathroom. Get her like thirty bucks of meds because I know really bad heartburn hurts like hell. We talk in the car on the way home a bit. 

Now why I think I may be the AS is because I said ""I feel like you just use me as a sound board for your medical stuff. You don't ask me about work, school or my day anymore. I also had no idea you felt this way and wish you would have told me I wasn't giving you what you needed before you yelled at me"".  I feel I may have brought this up at the wrong time and am letting my personal lack of emotional energy influence this. We also had a huge blow out a few weeks ago where we both said some pretty hurtful things that I am not completely over. We are currently taking a break from speaking as this has lead to another huge fight.

I(30nb) have a twin (30f) who was diagnosed w/ POTS, EDS & Mass cell activation in the last few weeks.I noticed a pattern of her bringing up her medical stuff to me almost once a day, if not more. I have been trying to be understanding/patient, provide non judgemental feedback and don't catastrophe. Usually I say stuff like  ""I'm glad you found a doctor that you like/listen to you"", ""everyone has different limits"", ""rest, you need it"" or I go over the best case scenario if she has blood work she wants me to look at. Admittedly, I work in a high intensity eating disorder unit which may contribute to her feelings of frustration towards me. I thought I was being good at being supportive. Tho I am sure there is truth in her stating I come off as annoyed even if I don't try to show it. Also was under the impression I was doing well at it as she keeps coming to me. 

Well it all came to a hault at my mom's bday dinner. She ate acidic foods at the movie theater, & had a huge sugary margarita at dinner. This gave her horrible heart burn. She walked away from dinner. I went to check on her a few times and she finally just asked to chill in my car (I drove us there). When we went outside she was screaming in my back seat. I was surprised and looked at her and stated ""why did you order and finish that huge drink dummy"". I now realize it was not the best thing to say, and it did not come off as a light hearted joke. She snapped at me and yelled ""YOU NEVER F""ING BELIEVE ME WHEN IM IN PAIN"" in front of the whole family. I was taken back/hurt. I even have given her money to help with doctors vistes. At that point I told her to get her feet in the car and stop screaming. My tone was not gentle by any means at this point. I stated I will take you to the ER. But you have to stop yelling or I can't drive you (it's not safe). I told her someone will probably call the cops or ambulance if you can't/I will if you can't and are in that much pain. We are finally heading to the local ER & She suddenly is able to stop yelling & states it's just heart burn, she just wants to go home. So I take her to the gas station. Let her go to the bathroom. Get her like thirty bucks of meds because I know really bad heartburn hurts like hell. We talk in the car on the way home a bit. 

Now why I think I may be the AS is because I said ""I feel like you just use me as a sound board for your medical stuff. You don't ask me about work, school or my day anymore. I also had no idea you felt this way and wish you would have told me I wasn't giving you what you needed before you yelled at me"".  I feel I may have brought this up at the wrong time and am letting my personal lack of emotional energy influence this. We also had a huge blow out a few weeks ago where we both said some pretty hurtful things that I am not completely over. We are currently taking a break from speaking as this has lead to another huge fight.

80,1dh8369,AITA for storming out of the house after my mum read my diary?,"So I (19F) still live at home with my mum (42F). I spend a lot of time at my boyfriend’s place but we’ve only been together 8 months so I’m not quite in a place where I want to move in with him yet. 

I have BPD and anxiety. My therapist told me to keep a diary so I can write down all of my thoughts and feelings and emotions, so I don’t have to take them out on someone else. Honestly, it helps a lot. But obviously, a diary is a very private place because generally they contain things that you wouldn’t want anyone else knowing. 

Anyway, I keep my diary under my pillow when I’m not in the house, because even though no one generally goes into my room, I know curiousity might get the better of someone if they were to walk into my room and see my diary open on my bed. 

I was out at my boyfriend’s house all day and I got back home at about 11:30pm. I walked up to my room and saw my mum sat on my bed, holding my diary and looking at me VERY angrily. Truth be told, I had written some mean things about her in there when I was mad at her, but I never intended for her to see it and I was actually planning on burning the diary when I had completed it. 

She threw the diary at me and told me I was a shameful excuse of a daughter and how could I say these things about her?? I tried to explain that rage is a big part of my BPD and it was either take out my anger in my diary, or on her. And obviously I don’t want to do that because I love my mum!!

She wouldn’t listen and I got frustrated, said i’m leaving, and went back to my boyfriend’s house. my boyfriend said that it was wrong of her to read my diary, but that I shouldn’t have stormed out but tried to talk to her. 

My mum has not tried to contact me all day. I don’t really want to go home now, I feel violated and intruded on. The one safe space I had to express my feelings is gone. 

AITA for leaving?? Should I have been understanding of her anger and stayed to talk?? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-16,"AITA for storming out of the house after my mum read my diary?

I am happy to prepare food for it and celebrate it together but I always ask him to get the food, or at least tell me what he would like to have for such celebrations. So this time was no different, in the morning he went for prayers with our son and said that we together will prep breakfast when they're back. Out of love I wanted to make sure all is ready for when they're back, so I prepped the food, added some extras, cleaned the tabled changed table cloth so it would look nice and presentable, the only thing was left to do were eggs, which we prefer to do it fresh anyway. So when my husband came back he saw the table and said nothing, he went to the kitchen to start prepping eggs. I went to help him and asked if he saw the table, he said he did. So then I asked if he liked it? He said yes, to which I said that it would be nice if he would acknowledge it as I put the effort in.

He said thank you but don't expect a thank you in the future as there are only 2 days of big religious celebrations in the year and according to his culture it is expected for me to prep and serve food when he's back after prayers.

Should I not receive any appreciation for the extra effort I put it, making sure food is ready as I know both my son and my husband would be hungry when they got back.

82,1dh7q59,AITA for wanting my partner to apologise ,"My partner doesn't apologise, and it sometimes drives me nuts.

For example, we go out for the evening. After we have driven for 10 mins he says ""I forgot my wallet"". We return, he goes in, I wait in the car. He returns 20 mins later, and doesn't say ""I am sorry it took so long"". He says ""the wallet wasn't where I remembered it was, and it took me 15 minutes to find it"". I don't particularly care, I don't need an explanation, but I would like to hear ""I am sorry""; it could be ""I am sorry it took so long, I didn't remember..."". But he doesn't give the apology, just the explanation.

The other day we were walking with bikes, the path got narrow, I went ahead, he ran my foot over with the wheel of his bike. He said ""the path is too narrow"". No ""I am sorry"".

This is a consistent pattern. He offers an explanation, but on 90% of occasions no apology.

When I am not tired, well-slept and fed, I do not outwardly react to this, even though it rubs me the wrong way every time. If I am tired, underslept or hungry, I might react with ""Why wouldn't you say sorry?"".

This conversation is unsuccessful. He usually first repeats the explanation. If I say ""yes, I understand the reasons, but I would like an apology"" he would most likely say something like ""I am sorry the path is so narrow!!!"". If I am unsatisfied with this, which usually I am not, he says ""I said sorry and you are still unhappy"". Then anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour of a stupid fight occurs, and he finally produces a reasonable response to the initial cause. ""I am sorry I ran over your foot and I am sorry for not apologising earlier"".

I am getting tired with this fight, they are so pointless. I keep reminding myself that trying to change others is a stupid idea.

Am I the asshole? Are my expectations unreasonable?

strict parents. Because of this she dosnt really have any socials I am able to contact her on. I have spoken to her many times about if she could get discord or WhatsApp etc. But she has been 
unable to do so. However she does have WhatsApp but according to her her Mum says it's only so her art teacher can send her messages.
Last week Monday we were all just chatting when Freya makes a gesture to Ellie to take a few steps away from me.
Freya attempted to whisper something in Ellies ear but I intervene and ask Freya what she was doing
 I told her it made me uncomfortable that whatever she was saying in Ellie's ear couldn't be said to me.
Freya passed Ellie a peice of paper and whispered something Ellie's ear and Ellie said out loud oh it's her phone number. I got really mad with Freya as I felt my trust had been broken and Ellie had never even asked for Freya's number. We haven't properly spoken scince then and she's been extremely cold. I feel this isn't far on Ellie as Freya has cut her self off from Ellie as well. I have a mutual friend called Emma (again fake name for security reasons) and she knows what's happening as Freya has started spending time with her and her friends. Emma told Freya told apologise and Freya approached me. She said Emma told me to come over here and apologise and she couldn't have sounded more unhappy about it.

However, Sarah is only 5’2 and weighs about 155, and she refuses to participate in sports and such because it makes her feel self conscious.

I packed her a salad and a few turkey wraps most days, along with a few sides like hard boiled eggs. I gave her enough food to have energy during practice, but she became mad because the dance team at her school has a habit of all going out to eat in small groups/sometimes as one big group and basically carb loading and eating all the junk food they want during intensive weeks/days like these because “all the calories will burn off anyways”. 

 my husband (44M) took her side. My husband says it’s unfair to be so strict on James and Liana who are much more active than Sarah is.

In addition, he told me that I shouldn’t be completely banning sweet treats from the house because James and Liana knew how to eat them in moderation.

It was a shirt with a frog in a cowboy hat with „Dyslexic with a Dig Bick” written under it, as i’m sure you could gather he himself is dyslexic so i thought it was suitable. When we hung out i gave it to him and he loved it, said it was stupid as hell and laughed as id expected. After we both went home he put the shirt on his story and tagged me saying thank you. However my boyfriend (m19) saw this and asked me if i didnt see anything wrong with it? I said no? What do you mean? And he continued by saying that the text on the shirt made him uncomfortable as he is my friend and im joking about his size. I responded by saying that I didn’t really think of it that way and got it mostly because he’s dyslexic and the following phrase was a funny absurd thing. He said that didn’t change anything and asked if i wouldn’t be weirded out if he gave a female friend of his a shirt referencing her boobs. And i said i’m not sure.

I (20F) and have been in a uni group for 16 weeks. There are 3 other girls aged 19 to 20. To cut a long story short the first assignment was bearable as Lucy, one of the younger girls, was constantly on our backs about doing our sections weeks in advance vecuse she had plans.

I am feeling bullied and belittled. She has been demanding I stop working to meet up in person to do the report while we then sit there and do our own separate part instead of collaborate. This last weekend I have been working a lot and I told the group that I can work on the assignment before and after everyday. The next day I was spammed with 13 texts and 3 calls from Lucy demanding me that my section needs to be done that night and to acknowledge their texts, I turned off my phone because it was so bad), and to be a team player.

89,1dh601v,AITA for refusing to eat at a restaurant?,"Sorry for my bad English. I am not a native speaker, so there might be some errors.

I (18F) am extremely picky when it comes to food, especially sauces, meat, and fruits. I always try to eat foods I've never tasted before, but 8 out of 10 times, I dislike them. 
My friends know how picky I am and often make fun of me, saying I'm ""missing out.""

The problem is, yesterday my friends and I went out for a birthday dinner at a new fancy restaurant in town. I was excited until I looked at the menu. I instantly knew I would dislike everything on it because I've tried similar dishes before, and I am not willing to pay $40 just to dislike my meal. Since there were no simple options like fries, I just got a drink and declined everything else except the complimentary bread.

My friends were visibly upset when I said I wasn't willing to try anything because I knew I wouldn't like it. They offered to pay for my meal and urged me to try something, but I still refused because I knew I wouldn't enjoy it. When I woke up today, I found an angry message in our group chat complaining that it was rude of me not to eat. I explained that I just knew I wouldn't like what they offered, since most dishes were either mixed with fruits I dislike (like avocados) or meats I don't enjoy.

So, am I the asshole for refusing to eat?

91,1dh5qhl,AITA for asking that my cousin wears clothes around the house?,"I got removed from my parent's house by social services last week because my mom is going through some issues at the moment and is too depressed to leave her bed. I was first placed in a group home for 'foster children' though I don't think I'm a foster child because my mom is still caring for me she is just going through something at the moment.

I personally think I would have been fine staying at home because I'm very mature for my age, everyone tells me. But my grandpa reported my mom to social services which is why I got removed.

After being at the group home for a few days my uncle finally got permission to take me in for a while until my mom is better. I don't know my uncle that well, he's my dad's brother and since my dad died I haven't really had much contact with his side of the family.

My uncle lives with his two sons who are 11 ('Oliver') and 9 ('Jamie'). I've had to start sharing a room with Oliver and Jamie shares with my uncle since there are only 2 bedrooms in the house. I hate this because at my proper house I have my own room and I just don't understand why I can't stay there. I've had to be removed from school because my uncle lives so far away and they're not able to get a place for me until September which means I am just sat at home doing nothing all the time. I just hate it here.

When we're home Oliver never wears clothes, sometimes Jamie too but he usually wears underwear. But the second that Oliver gets home from school he just strips completely. It makes me feel so uncomfortable and weird because why does he feel he can expose me to that? I don't like seeing it and it just weird.

I mentioned this to my uncle and he basically told me to 'deal with it', and that this was 'Oliver's house first'. I told him that I think it's weird and it makes me feel uncomfortable. He doesn't understand how much of a change this has been for me. I don't even want to be here, and it's so weird that Oliver just won't wear underwear at least. It's not like it's a big deal? I don't want to see him undressed all the time.

95,1dh5itk,AITA for telling my SIL to stop asking me questions she doesn't want the answers to?,"I'm a teacher and sometimes because of this my SIL (husband's sister) will ask me questions about kids that she never likes the answers to. For the most part it's focused around kids and blended families because she and her husband have made one and there are things they question that she then expects me to give more insight into supposedly, but I feel like she wants validation and gets mad when it doesn't happen.

I'll list a couple of examples:

Her oldest kids teacher sent home a message on his school tablet. The message was addressed to the parent specifically and not the parents. She was upset to learn her son had asked for it to be addressed that way vs to the parents. She asked me if that was something kids would normally do instead of letting it be ""to the parents of child"". I told her my school handled it differently but I know from some teachers who used to send home actual notes, that they did encounter some kids who would specify even if they had an active stepparent. She told me that's abnormal and I said it's something teachers encounter. I told her I get corrected if I say parents to a kid instead of parent sometimes and I learn not to do it. She told me that was utter bullshit and kids don't really do that kind of thing.

Her older two kids and her stepkids all use step and half exclusively and they never use brother/sister for siblings not full bio. She asked in the context of school do I hear this often and I said yes. I said I hear kids use step and half for siblings and it's about 50/50 in my experience. She refused to believe it was that frequent and that the parents don't put a stop to it. She accused me of lying.

Context on SILs family:  SIL had two bio kids when she met her husband. Both of them have different fathers. Her oldest kids father died 5 years ago and they broke up during her pregnancy, her and her second kids father broke up when both were still pretty young. Her husband has three kids. One from a college girlfriend and two from his ex-wife. Together SIL and her husband have two kids together. So they are very blended and there are some other parents involved. More so with her husband's ex's. The kids range from 14 now down to 3.

96,1dh5dk1,AITA for asking my mum to stop making comments about my weight loss?,"So I 19F am fat. I always have been on the larger side and that doesn't really bother me. It's not causing me health concerns so I don't really see it as a problem. Ever since I was about 12 my mum 61F has been on and off on fad diets and doing exercise trying to loose weight because she is also rather large.  I have never really cared what I looked like so I went along a bit but didn't really take it seriously, and I was unable to do alot of the exercise due to (non weight related) chronic pain.   Now I'm at uni and my eating habits are sporadic at best. I rarely eat 3 meals a day because I can't be arsed, it's mainly a sandwich and some snacks. And the occasional takeaway. However what changed the most is for my degree I'm on an archeological dig, and due to help for my back pain I'm able to do it for the 8hrs a day with breaks. I have done it for 2 weeks so far and have lost weight given by the fact I have had to alter my shorts. 
And that's all well and good but every time I have seen my mum since the start she tells me I look so much better because I have lost weight. I have asked her to stop, because good looks have nothing to do with size, and being told that she didn't think I was as nice before, hurts my feelings. Like I don't care about my looks  but hearing from your mum that you have improved because you have lost a bit of weight hurts.  She doesn't get why it hurts my feelings because she would love to be told that. 
Personally I don't think it's appropriate to talk about someone's weight if they are not doing something activity about it.

Ever since I was about 12 my mum 61F has been on and off on fad diets and doing exercise trying to loose weight because she is also rather large.  I have never really cared what I looked like so I went along a bit but didn't really take it seriously, and I was unable to do alot of the exercise due to (non weight related) chronic pain.   Now I'm at uni and my eating habits are sporadic at best. I rarely eat 3 meals a day because I can't be arsed, it's mainly a sandwich and some snacks. And the occasional takeaway. However what changed the most is for my degree I'm on an archeological dig, and due to help for my back pain I'm able to do it for the 8hrs a day with breaks. I have done it for 2 weeks so far and have lost weight given by the fact I have had to alter my shorts. 
And that's all well and good but every time I have seen my mum since the start she tells me I look so much better because I have lost weight. I have asked her to stop, because good looks have nothing to do with size, and being told that she didn't think I was as nice before, hurts my feelings. Like I don't care about my looks  but hearing from your mum that you have improved because you have lost a bit of weight hurts.  She doesn't get why it hurts my feelings because she would love to be told that.

For a year and a half, I've been spending my weekends helping a family friend, Miranda, with their small business restaurant. I have another job that prevents me from being there full time. Before me, she was running the kitchen by herself. I have kitchen experience so I told her I could help her in the kitchen on weekends. She's been paying me cash ($8.50/hr) which was fine because I had some luxuries (watching what I want on the TV's, listening to my music, etc.). 

Recently, she got a new ""business"" partner, John. He doesn't have any financial investment in the business. Miranda said they were on a trial basis and not official. Basically, he started overhauling everything. He changed the menu, prices and days of operation. Usually on the weekend, John and I are in the kitchen while Miranda works the front of house. Yesterday, Miranda went out of town for the day so John agreed to work front and I was scheduled for kitchen. 

Yesterday, John spent majority of his time in the kitchen which by default put me in the front (which I didn't agree to). John said this is how business works, we have to sacrifice, etc. Anyways, I didn't want to work the front so I call in the front worker from the week to come in and left. I communicated to Miranda that this was happening. In hindsight I could have communicated better and that wasn't the best way to leave. I told Miranda this and apologized. 

Anyway, John got offended and said that he's going to be working every Saturday if I have a problem with him, then the business doesn't need me. He says that the partnership is official (no one told me this and Miranda says they are still working on the contract.) Anyways, I said I don't have an issue working with John. I have an issue not getting to work in the kitchen like we all agreed. 

John said I wasn't a team player, etc. I told Miranda that I've been here since the beginning doing more than my fair share for poor compensation and John just showed up a month ago. John said I'm not working anymore but Miranda (who is still sole owner) says that she wants me there on Saturdays. 

At this point, IDC how John feels about me but I don't know if I can continue to be friends with Miranda if he becomes her official partner. It's awkward because I hang out with Miranda all the time outside of the restaurant and our families are close but if that's what has to happen. Oh well.

It had been quite some time since I had taken mushrooms so I planned to stay the night at my friends house as a precautionary step if things lasted longer than expected, so I told my plans to stay the night to my wife(f) in advance of the dinner/mushrooms. At the time, to me, she didn’t seem to mind the idea.

After a few hours of experiencing the mushrooms I was feeling tired, sick, cold and wanted to go home. So I walked the short distance home even though I had made the plans to stay the night. 

(For the record it was a very unpleasant walk)

She ha told me after the night has been and gone that she was too shocked at the prospect of me staying at a friends house to even react in the moment when I mentioned it.

Her reasoning behind this is that why would a husband not come home to his wife, especially when it’s only a few blocks away from the friends house and that I have walked home from there late at night in the past.

My reasoning is that the friends house I planned to stay at is a friend of close to 15 years and that considering I’d be taking mushrooms for the first time in over a decade I expected it to be a long journey.

Please help, any feedback would be really helpful.

My dad has this on and off again relationship with my mom and also with his twice ex-wife. He just has me with mom but he has three kids with his twice ex-wife (who he's living with again). My mom keeps taking him back and so does the ex-wife. There has always been a back and forth and during a breakup with both of them my dad was with someone else and he has a kid with her who isn't around and I think my dad and the ex and my mom like to ignore the fact dad made another kid, my half siblings don't know about this other half sibling.

My dad could have more kids too. I'm not too sure but it's likely given his back and forth and I don't believe it's only my mom or his twice ex-wife he cheats with. But that's not really any of my business and I don't care if he has more kids, which might sound shitty because we'd technically be related but I don't see that as a chance to be family. The ones I'm supposedly ""family"" with I'm not at all close to and we hate each others guts. They hate me for my mom being around and I hate them because they go from wanting me to not exist to expecting me to worship the ground their mom walks on. They also bitch that I don't have the same rules or expectations they do and that's because my dad knows I don't respect him and so he told me to go fuck myself and basically he makes me go to his house to get out of child support but I get to do my own thing.

So yeah, not a healthy ""family"". I don't have a good relationship with mom either because I hate that she puts dad before me.

103,1dh465u,AITA for Refusing to Be Involved with My Brother's Toxic Girlfriend and Their New Baby?,"I (18F) have an older brother (24M) who I've been close to most of my life. We weren't best friends, but we rarely fought and usually had each other's backs. He started working at a retail store two years ago, where he met his now-girlfriend, Nancy (fake name). He began dating her in February of last year. I didn't have strong opinions about her initially, but she quickly showed questionable behavior.



My brother told me she was cheating on him just two weeks into their relationship, along with other issues. While I hate cheaters, I let my brother handle his relationship. This continued for about five months, revealing more red flags. Both my mom and I noticed bruises on him, and his personality changed significantly. Concerned, we contacted one of his best friends, who also worked with Nancy. He confirmed her abusive behavior, leaving us even more worried.



I reached out to another friend, whose girlfriend, Sofia, was related to Nancy and had lived with her. Sofia and her mom confirmed Nancy's problematic nature, including stealing, home-wrecking, and lying. I became increasingly worried about my brother's well-being.



Despite my feelings, I pretended to be friendly with Nancy while starting a new school and getting to know my now-boyfriend. Not long after, Nancy pressured my brother into moving out. She'd been living on her own since she was 20 (she's now 22) with minimal parental involvement, so I don't entirely blame her for her behavior.



Two weeks after moving to our grandma's house, my brother visited and nervously revealed that Nancy was pregnant. The news shattered me. I cried uncontrollably, and my parents were also unhappy. We doubted the baby was his.



From that point, I avoided Nancy entirely. On New Year's Eve, she texted me from a coworker's phone, accusing me of immaturity and saying she didn't want me near her baby. My brother confronted me, and I explained that she was destroying her last family connections. My parents sided with me and asked my brother to talk to her. I didn't respond to Nancy's text to avoid giving her more ammunition against me.



A few weeks later, my uncle invited my mom to his house. We arrived to find my brother, Nancy, my uncle, and his wife, Anna, discussing a Facebook message where my mom had called Anna mean names because she called Nancy ugly. They sorted it out, but Nancy loudly repeated her accusations against me, calling me spoiled. I lost my temper and told her everything I thought of her.



After that, my parents insisted I be nice to Nancy, but I refused. The baby was born on June 11th. My parents forced me to go to the hospital, but I didn't see the baby. When my brother and Nancy came to our house unannounced, they forced me to hold the baby. I barely looked at Nancy.



Now, my parents are pressuring me to be happy about the baby and spend time with Nancy and my brother. But I stand firm in not wanting to be involved.

104,1dh42ci,AITA for brushing off my best friend coming to town with people who hate me?,"My siblings say my (M27) best friend (NB24) is not being a good friend to me, but I disagree....mostly


My best friend Lainey (Different name) and I met in college and hit it off just before the pandemic. Over the last 5-ish years, I've been with them through the end of their last long term relationship, them coming out as NB, their slow transition to being proud of who they are, and their developing career in our industry. They, on the other hand, have guided me through multiple classes and the two lowest points in my life - one right as we met, the other around 6 months ago after my career fell apart. The two of us are very close and talk daily. 

Here's the rub, or at least, most of it. After their transition, Lainey began hanging out with a group of people that were in college with us, who hate me on principal. I dont have a ton of history with any of them - a. Couple of them worked on certain projects with me through the college years, but we never floated in the same circles. That being said, this group has been cruel and vocal about their dislike for me as a person, despite never actually really being around me outside of a college setting. Lainey used to be incredibly introverted pre-transition, and this group quickly became their core social group. Our friendship went through a rocky phase shortly after that I still dont fully understand, but with a few conversations setting boundaries on both our sides we were back to mostly the same.  However, Lainey has done a few things that make me feel a little....less than, tolerated, and/or shitty. One prime example is asking for my advice and help shopping for a party that I wasnt invited to, because this group would be there. Lainey would only hang out with me one on one - after college, I was kept far from their social life, this group and otherwise. As much as I love them, there is still definite jealousy and fear of being replaced on my part. 

A few months ago, I moved across the state, and we've kept our friendship up via text, snapchat, etc. After a conversation about them coming up to my city with that group of people for an event, I was frustrated because they were coming all the way over here and were making that group a priority and may not have had time to see me. I was also not excited to be in the same area as a group of people who have caused me so much strife. I fully understand how petty that is, but I vented to my siblings and they believe Lainey has been two-faced when it comes to our friendship and I should drop them. Being in a new area, I dont know anyone around me yet. I have a fair few friends scattered across the state, but I dont have a vehicle right now so I'm a bit isolated. To put it blunty, Lainey is the strongest friendship I have and the thought of losing that causes an incredible amount of grief. The list of things they have done for me is too long to type - and I hope they feel the same about me. I also believe I have 0 say in who someone gets to be friends with, regardless of how I feel about it.

A few months ago, I moved across the state, and we've kept our friendship up via text, snapchat, etc. After a conversation about them coming up to my city with that group of people for an event, I was frustrated because they were coming all the way over here and were making that group a priority and may not have had time to see me. I was also not excited to be in the same area as a group of people who have caused me so much strife. I fully understand how petty that is, but I vented to my siblings and they believe Lainey has been two-faced when it comes to our friendship and I should drop them. Being in a new area, I dont know anyone around me yet. I have a fair few friends scattered across the state, but I dont have a vehicle right now so I'm a bit isolated. To put it blunty, Lainey is the strongest friendship I have and the thought of losing that causes an incredible amount of grief. The list of things they have done for me is too long to type - and I hope they feel the same about me. I also believe I have 0 say in who someone gets to be friends with, regardless of how I feel about it.

107,1dh3no0,AITA for studying instead of visting GF of 9 months who had her wisdom tooth removed?,"Hey,

just for context, 22 year old male, studying industrial engineering, 2nd semester, couldn't pursue education for 3 years because of an illness, moved out from home for university due to what I suppose was a narcissistic father, therefore I have issues assessing this situation. Also, first relationship 

It is currently pretty stressful, as I have an oral exam coming up, where I have to know all the physics lab experiments we did (16 in total) by heart including all of the theory. 

Therefore I am very stressed and studying as much as I can. Seasonal allergies make focusing even harder. 

Usually we see each other during the weekends because we live 1 and 1/2 hours apart. I couldn't see her last weekend, because I had to finish the physics lab protocol, which took almost the entire weekend. 

I have the oral exam this tuesday, so I couldn't manage to make time to visit her. Studying at her place doesn't really work, because her parents have a dog, which causes allergic asthma for me, making studying and concentrating even harder. 

She texted me that she is hurt and feels like she is not important enough to me, especially now where she got here wisdom tooth removed. She also suggested going our seperate ways. 

I feel terrible for not being able to visit her, but I also feel like I must not fail this education, as I already lost 3 years due to combating an illness and I don't really have anyone to rely on financially (father doesn't have any income, mom raises my 8yo brother on her salary). 

So I wonder, am I unreasonable? 

Am I a terrible person for not making the time? 

A bit more context, we text everyday regularly (sometimes it would take me a few hours to reply when being in a study session), up until the conflict we would talk over the phone for about an hour every evening.

I sent flowers her way to cheer her up after surgery.

Whenever she visited me, I usually always surprised her with a bouquet of flowers and fresh strawberries, or homemade cake, maybe fresh crépes, affordable silver rings or for easter I prepared an easter-basket with edible paper-grass and chocolate eggs.

I also always paid for our meals when we went dining (two times until now).

I am also usually the only one to tell her I am glad to see her. 

She doesn't really reciprocate anything I mentioned here, but still tells me, that she feels like she is not important enough. 

The only verbal affection I receive are occasional ""I miss you"" texts. More often than not I feel like she doesn't really care and while she expressed, that it is hard for her to be vulnerable, in general I pick up more negative signals than positive ones (could also be an issue of my perception).

She asked me while we were out eating dinner, and I said no. She asked me about 20 times and even suggested that I get latex gloves and put the blanket in a bag, then put it in the wash. I still said no; there was plenty of other people to ask.

So she gets someone to put it in a bag and she put it in the wash. She mumbles under her breath, saying she's gonna have to start saying ""no"" to people because they want to see her struggle. It goes on for 15 minutes until I tell her to be quiet because she's saying the same stuff over & over. 
Her: No, I won't be quiet!

Me: You keep mumbling; if you have something to say, just say it.

Her: I already said everything I needed to say!

She then proceeds to call me selfish. Which is ironic because I've been the exact opposite. *While she's busy doing her adult things, she has me looking after her kid to where I can't take care of myself (feeding him, helping w/ homework, putting him to bed, getting him ready for school, taking and picking him up from school). This has been going in for 10 months (8 months consistently).*

Me: We could've went out another day if you had things to do. No one is forcing you to do things for me or others.

Then my other sister hops in and takes my sister's side. 

*I'm not a confrontational person (makes my heart beat fast and I sweat) so I'm normally very passive and talk very calmly because of it (I'm also a germophobe if you couldn't tell) but my family is very opinionated and authoritative towards the younger members so it's tough.They said I was being smart and a AH but I don't think I was.*

Edit: Sorry it's badly written; it was either that or it would've been super long to read. 

I wasn't babysitting him. She found the covers like that on her time and decided not to wash them. We were out eating dinner, and she asked me if I could put the blankets in the wash when we got home. I said no, but she kept asking. And then the argument happened. 

My sister knows I'm a germophobe, and I've always told her. Something similar also happened in the past. My nephew threw up in front of us, and she tried to push it onto me but got upset because I said I wouldn't do it. But she insists that if she does things for people all the time, they should do the same in return: no complaints, no hesitance, no anything, just obedience.

Edit 2: Some people are saying ESH & that I could've just grabbed the covers like my sister asked. But for 1. it's not my responsibility; I don't use the blanket, nor do I sleep in that area. Her son has been my responsibility for almost a year, and I'm not about to be putting up with anymore of it. 2. I'm simply setting my boundary, respectfully, and she's disregarding that. People need to understand that no means no. Don't beg people to do things for you after they already told you their answer; it's not gonna change. 

I've always mentioned to my sister, if you have important things to do, put your needs before others because if not, it's gonna be a lot to handle. No one is forcing her to do these things for others.

Then, with me being a germophobe, I don't even like touching my own body fluids. I don't even like to sweat, like that's so nasty.

Back story, he cheated multiple times throughout our marriage. We tried to work it out after the first separation but things were never the same. After gaslighting and harassment I just wanted out. We filed a non contested divorce with him paying $600 in child support a month. Throughout the years, he never really made the full amount. I have a great career and have the kids all the time minus the every other weekend visitation (standard visitation orders due to his work schedule). Our child support order was through our decree. I agreed on that set amount cause I just wanted out of the marriage.

Fast forward to now, I am in a committed relationship and my now live in bf gets along with my kids so well. Seeing me struggle is not what he likes and offers to provide for anything. It’s taken me time to get used to that but I still don’t feel it is his responsibility to financially support children from a previous marriage. Anyway, I recently requested an increase in child support since the economy sucks and groceries are expensive. I have literally bought the same groceries and they have increased in price substantially. My ex refused and after additional harassment and belittling on his part towards me he stated, “fine we’ll let the court decide!” So, after years of not having a backbone I filled for child support through the state.

He was so angry when he received his notice of child support case being open. He has refused to even giving anything at this point. He believes the money is for me and not the kids. Now I know there are some mothers out there that abuse the system but I can assure you I am not one of them. I don’t spend anything on myself other than $50 a month for self care. I am definitely in more of a bind now without receiving anything until our court date (his response). Mind you my portion of the bills are covered by my job (rent, utilities, etc.). We both created these children and just because we got divorced does not mean he can stop raising our children financially. The kids continue to visit him on his scheduled time (I feel children need both of their parents). So, am I the AH for filing?

But I agreed because I care about him, he’s been inside for awhile too. 

I have been dabbling in some things again because I have gone into a deep dark place with my depression. It’s not really me tbh but it’s helping me get through a hard time. (Some shrooms/dmt). 

Well anyway I feel like he’s kinda disrespecting me claiming I’m always sketched out because I use the apps “signal” and “telegram”. Then again maybe I sound like the A-hole because I’m telling him ahead of time I don’t want to talk about this stuff. He’s very much into drugs still and more than micro dosing for depression like me. I don’t like people hearing about it. Knowing I’m taking anything. 

I like privacy and anonymity on the internet/text when talking about certain things too and he’s making a big deal of it. I am sort of libertarian in my views. I believe in unconditional freedom and privacy. The government can and will spy on people. And it makes me feel uncomfortable knowing that talking about a few things.

I have been dabbling in some things again because I have gone into a deep dark place with my depression. It’s not really me tbh but it’s helping me get through a hard time. (Some shrooms/dmt). 

Well anyway I feel like he’s kinda disrespecting me claiming I’m always sketched out because I use the apps “signal” and “telegram”. Then again maybe I sound like the A-hole because I’m telling him ahead of time I don’t want to talk about this stuff. He’s very much into drugs still and more than micro dosing for depression like me. I don’t like people hearing about it. Knowing I’m taking anything. 

I like privacy and anonymity on the internet/text when talking about certain things too and he’s making a big deal of it. I am sort of libertarian in my views. I believe in unconditional freedom and privacy. The government can and will spy on people. And it makes me feel uncomfortable knowing that talking about a few things. 

His answer was I shouldn’t care. 


Is wanting to be more lowkey about being on something around strangers or drugs in general a bad thing?

Every now and then when we're watching TV or something, she'll ask me to hold a plushie because ""they need attention"".

I'm fine with all this and used to do think it was cute but it's gotten to a point where she wants me to talk to them.

She asked me why I don't care about them or talk to them and I said ""you understand they're not real, right?""

Recently I (19F) was at my boyfriend's (20M) house. He still lives with his parents and never cleans his room. It has gotten to the point where some cups in his room have started to mold. His parents have a long lost hope that he will ever clean it. They occasionally do clean his room (removing cups, bottles etc.) and he always gets mad about it (kinda understandable they disturb his privacy).

 I personally don't feel very comfortable in his room due to me having a habit of cleaning everything that is remotely dirty. I've talked to him about this issue and he always tells me that he will eventually clean his room (it has been 4 months and I regularly remind him). 

I slowly started to do something in his room like folding clothes and surprisingly he never said anything about it (He was aware that I did this because he was in the same room).

 So last Friday when he wasn't home I cleaned his desk. I didn't put anything way just organized his stuff (papers on papers pens in a pen holder etc.) When he got home I told him to please not get mad. At this point he was already extremely mad and rushed towards his room. I told him that I didn't put anything away just organized it but he ignored me and opened the door.

 He stood in his doorway was silent for a minute and then as calmly as he could said ""they just never learn"" (referring to his parents). At this point I stood behind him and just said nothing. He calmed himself down and continued with his day.

117,1dh2l9r,WIBTA for throwing my (hungover) partner under the bus for a messy unit during a rental inspection?,"Hiya internet jury,

I'm trying not to think about this too heavily lest I blow a gasket or crumble from embarrassment, but need to get this out in front of the court of reddit.

My partner and I had a private inspection at our rental unit yesterday, and the apartment was not adequately cleaned. I was away for the weekend and had done my best to prepare the apartment beforehand, leaving a manageable list to my partner to fulfill - the final but vital touches: vacuum, mop floors, put away washing and sweep the balcony. I had done the rest, spending a whole day putting everything away, rearranging and throwing a backlog of clutter out amongst other things.

I've just arrived home to find *none* of these tasks done and the inspection completed despite this. I'm talking hair and grime all over the bathroom floors, balcony covered in leaves and soot, cat litter scattered across the carpet... This unit has been on the market for sale for over a year now, and I can tell the owner has been struggling to get it sold, so having the place presentable and appealing was a top priority for me. I have a great record with this agent and value our agent/tenant relationship.   
  
I'm ashamed, embarrassed and trying not to take it out on my partner as it wouldn't help at this point: I've already expressed my disappointment to the guy, but am trying to stay in my 'happy place' as anger and blame doesn't help anyone here.

**Would I be the asshole** if I emailed our rental agent and apologised for my partner's negligence and the state of the unit during the inspection?

An alternative is to apologise on behalf of us both, but to contradict my 'happy place' sentiment, I just want to be absolved of this lest I become resentful. I realise this is largely about my shame, my pride and wanting to maintain a good relationship with the agents but I really feel compelled to explain the situation.

118,1dh2jcc,AITA for telling me wife I do not want to spend weekends at the cabin every weekend?,"I've been married for over 3 years. My spouse and I have a three-month-old boy. We both reside in a country with a cold winter and a hot summer. I left behind my friends and family to relocate to her country.

The family of my wife likes to spend their weekends in the countryside every summer, which runs from June to August. Her mother essentially spends the entire summer there because she works remotely. They have many allotments there to grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and other vegetables since she loves gardening. My wife's father passed away a few years ago, so her mum's on her own + my wife to maintain all of it.

In the past, before our son was born, I didn't really enjoy going there for the weekends because:

* Toilets are poor
* There is no AC; I sweat very easily while my wife gets cold very easily
* The mosquitoes there love me and I absolutely hate them
* The roads are tough to get around with a stroller

Please understand that I have no problem lending a hand to my wife's mother in the garden, I just dislike the surroundings.

I admitted to my wife (about 2 years ago) that I disliked going there, but I'm willing to find a compromise. Maybe I could come for 1 day every weekend, go home, and spend Sunday at home? My wife did not like that suggestion, but she reluctantly agreed.

Things have changed a little since we had our son. My wife is currently on maternity leave (which lasts 3 years in her country), which is typical in her country, and she essentially spends 4 or 5 days a week with our son over there. I am the primary provider, which I don't mind because my wife does a great deal to support and nurture our son.

My spouse replied that our son would benefit greatly from the air in the countryside, as opposed to the city (we live in a large metropolis). She would tell me that since she is there with our son, I should come as well, that I should not put myself first, and that I should not stay at home and do nothing (which is untrue, since I do the cooking, cleaning, washing since my wife got our son).

She would also say that I should leave my bad thoughts behind and simply show up in the countryside whenever I have the chance.

119,1dh2inb,AITA for giving my friend space,"*Using a throwaway and changing some unimportant details for privacy reasons.* 

I have a close friendship with two of my work colleagues - let's call them Cameron and Kevin. I have always been closest with Kevin as we started the job around the same time, but at the same time I have a closer friendship with Cameron than Kevin does. This has never been an issue and we have always been a trio.

For a couple months now, Kevin has been having some personal issues at home and in his relationship. His energy has changed at work since this and he became more distant from both of us, as you would absolutely expect when going through something like this. I have been sure to be extra supportive of Kevin during this time and check in regularly to ensure he is doing ok. But Kevin has made a couple comments about he doesn't like people asking him if he is ok. He is a bit of a brush it under the rug and pretend it isn't happening type. 

I interpreted these comments to be a not-so-subtle request to give him a bit of space and wanted to respect his process. Before I did I made it clear that he could always reach out if he needed anything or wanted to just talk it out. We are still close but things are still difficult for him at home and that distance is still there. 

During this time, my friendship with Cameron has definitely strengthened. We continue to invite and include Kevin always, but these invitations are often declined. Recently though, I have gotten the impression that Kevin is mad at me (maybe jealous?) for getting closer with Cameron as he has made a couple of comments about our friendship. Almost always these comments are made in the context of a joke, but I don't know I feel like there is something more there. 

I'll admit I do have some difficulties with friendships and social situations (I am on the spectrum) and sometimes struggle to interpret tone and intention. That to say that I am not 100% certain if I am interpreting Kevin's comments correctly and possibly these are my own insecurities showing. But there have been enough things said that it feels like more than a coincidence. 

I have never done anything intentional to exclude Kevin and have always maintained a close friendship without explicitly asking about his struggles at home. AITA for giving Kevin this space and accidentally strengthening a different friendship in that process?

So anyways, I (16M) was up at 1am, not doing anything loud but I was admittedly lazing around on my laptop. Anyways, I hear my mom (50sF) shoving the door to my room open, which honestly startled me as we sleep on different floors and all. She walked into my closet and began to pull clothes out and started to rearrange them, then started full-on yelling at me for leaving a hoodie lying over my chair. Now, I might have been the asshole cause I just asked her to leave me alone and let me rest due to the time (which may have been too aggressive or thankless, as I know that she is very particular about my room being clean and I haven't been maintaining it well recently). Then she started sobbing, saying that I'm always mad at her and that I don't appreciate her hard work, before storming out in tears.

For context, I've been sick for a couple of days and my family has been dragging me out of the house and on strenuous outings, worsening my condition, so I haven't been able to do much tonight besides lying in bed. So anyways, I (16M) was up at 1am, not doing anything loud but I was admittedly lazing around on my laptop. Anyways, I hear my mom (50sF) shoving the door to my room open, which honestly startled me as we sleep on different floors and all. She walked into my closet and began to pull clothes out and started to rearrange them, then started full-on yelling at me for leaving a hoodie lying over my chair. Now, I might have been the asshole cause I just asked her to leave me alone and let me rest due to the time (which may have been too aggressive or thankless, as I know that she is very particular about my room being clean and I haven't been maintaining it well recently). Then she started sobbing, saying that I'm always mad at her and that I don't appreciate her hard work, before storming out in tears. I'll fully accept a YTA verdict, it's pretty often for me to accidentally say very hurtful things, but I'm just a bit confused and would like another perspective here.",0.0,0.1172356531023979,0,1
121,1dh289m,AITAH For agreeing with my parents that speeding is not a good first impression?,"I am 17 male and currently live with both of my parents. My girlfriend is also 17 and lives with her mom as her parents have split. Her mom had a new boyfriend that we'll call Joe, who I believe I get along with even though I do at times consider some things he says too strange. Just yesterday my girlfriend asked me if I would like to go with her, her mom and Joe to her grandparents to see their new property. I said yes of course I'll ask my parents as it would be 30ish minutes away along an interstate and I ask my parents to go places. In the middle of asking the new boyfriend Joe and her mom show up at her door ready to get me without me telling my girlfriend wether they said yes or no, which at the time was a yes with some rules, but it had been a no. This is my parents first time meeting Joe, and they said he seemed nice and didn't have a problem with him. Joe is the designated driver as we are all in our truck, and on the interstate to go to where we needed to the speed limit was 70 or 75 I'm not exactly sure as it changes throughout. 
    
 The issue is that Joe at one point went 98 miles per hour to see if he could go as fast as a Corvette speeding down the interstate at a much higher speed. Were we safe, yes, and Joe is a good driver. But on my return home my parents said he seems nice and we have 0 problems with him, we just believe that going 28 miles per hour or basically 100 mph on the interstate was reckless and we don't want anything bad to happen to me because they worry about my safety. I told my girlfriend what they said, and she seemed upset and mad at them stating that they speed too. Yes they speed, I speed, she speeds, but speeding is a vast like vacuum idk how to explain. There's a differencw between them going 80 in a 70 or 75 rather than going 100 mph. I tried to explain to her that it's not that they don't like him or are trying to find reasons to not like him or something like that which they said themselves, they just believed that that was reckless.
   
  My girlfriend's response was that my parents think they're so high and better than everyone else and that they can speed and do whatever they want but no one else can.
   
   At that point I was trying to explain their thought process, and that it wouldnt have been an issue if he was going 80 or 85 not 100. But at that point she had her belief of it so there is no convincing, but she seemed upset at me for acting weird which I assume was for agreeing with my parents. To put in context for her pov she believes my mom does not like her, and that this was an attack or diss to make it so I can't see her which I don't believe it to be at all.

 So, AITAH for siding with my parents by thinking 98 mph is not a good first impression?

Edit: Fixed the wall of text and wanted to provide some more context. It was written at 3 am so it might read like a fever dream. He was not going 98 the whole time, after the corvette sped off he slowed to an 88, and was cruising like that. He is a bit of an arrogant person he said it himself that he was prideful and arrogant and you're only as old as you want and he's 13 or something. But the last bit of context was my girlfriend was trying to make a plan where I go to the beach with them, and I was trying to find a way to tell her the only way I'd be able to go would be if my family went and drove me, and I didn't know how to convey that without just telling her.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-16,"AITAH For agreeing with my parents that speeding is not a good first impression?

Because he has the option to get his license and just chooses not to, I don’t think that it’s fair for him to complain about my car when I get him to and from practices at 5:00 am everyday, and I normally buy him breakfast too because I know he is hungry (I don’t ask him for gas money either) since he doesn’t have a job.

123,1dh1v72,AITAH if i don't contact my siblings when they don't try to include me in things?,"Hey. I'm 26 (F) Honestly i was fighting myself for a long time about this. I've talked to various mental health workers about how i feel, and It just never stops. The feeling of bitterment, betrayal. Anger.

I'll start with this. My father passed about 2-3 years ago. During that time, I was talking with them while dad was in hospice. I have 4 sisters (One married in, and one was recently found out through a DNA test) and 2 brothers (One is part of this situation and one isn't). I'm talking about 5 of them today. I won't drop names, because I don't know if they have reddit or not. I should also mention that they are all older than me.

Basically, after dad passed- all communication pretty much stopped. I go on facebook sometimes and see posts from them. But now more recently, they all went on trips together. Without me. They don't send me messages to see how I'm holding up, Or to even just say 'HI.' And honestly, I'm just so emotionally and mentally crushed that they just don't seem to care.

Recently my health has begun to fail, and well... There's cancer in the family. Both my mother and father passed  from it. I'm trying to get in to get myself checked, but things are getting scary. I'm scared for the day that my hair might mysteriously fall out, or I'll just be asleep and can't wake up. I haven't told many of the family about this yet.

I know it's probably not right to be this bitter about it, but I've been alone for so long and every time i see their pictures, I just sit and cry. I was always the one to reach out, they never did ONCE. and as much as I hate to admit it, i know there was some sort of favoritism between dad and them.

My partner and I found a couple of puppies that seemed to be dumped on our rural property a few weeks ago, we then found a Facebook post of the missing puppies and returned them to the owners. 

The owners have no reached out to me asking to come get them because she no longer wants them, I immediately said to my partner we need to go get them cause I don’t want to see them dumped, we suspect that they actually were dumped when we originally found them as there was a box next to them. 
My partner is absolutely not on board with this, I said they would be gone by the end of the week (I would contact a rescue) and that would be the end of it but I don’t want them staying in a place where they would get dumped and left to die if she decides she wants them gone right now. 

I am a dog trainer and they would be my responsibility until they are gone. The puppies are not sick.

125,1dh1bub,AITA for Denying My Cousin's Stay Request Due to Limited Space with My Girlfriend?,"I (32M) recently moved into a new apartment and have been enjoying the space and independence, especially with my girlfriend. When my cousin Emily (30F), who's facing housing issues, asked if she could stay with us temporarily, I hesitated due to concerns about our living situation.

Emily has a history of being disorganized and overstaying her welcome, which made me reluctant to agree. Politely, I explained to her that our apartment is already quite snug with just my girlfriend and me, and that it wouldn't be feasible for her to move in right now. I suggested she explore other options for housing assistance.

Emily seemed disappointed and shared my decision with our extended family. Since then, I've been bombarded with calls and messages from relatives who argue that family should always support each other in times of need. They believe we have the space and resources to accommodate Emily, and that it wouldn't hurt to lend her a hand during this tough period.

To complicate matters, Emily has even suggested that my girlfriend could find her own place so Emily could move in with me. This suggestion has added tension to the situation, as my girlfriend and I are committed to living together and maintaining our own space.

While I understand my family's perspective on helping each other out, I also value the harmony my girlfriend and I have established in our home. Adding another person, especially one who has suggested displacing my girlfriend, could disrupt that balance. I feel torn between wanting to help Emily and respecting my girlfriend's need for privacy and comfort.

Am I the asshole for sticking to my decision and refusing to let Emily move in with us, despite not having room due to my girlfriend already sharing our apartment?

128,1dh14vk,AITAH for not working,"So I probably am but I've been unemployed for about a month now, had a three week temp job before this, and was unemployed 6 months before then and before that I was basically bedrotting for two college semesters and worked a mailroom temp job in between those semesters. Last November I confessed to my mom about skipping classes and apparently being depressed so she brought me back as long as I go to therapy and work. 

Been doing therapy that's been great but progress is slow with only an hour a week and I have a job coach for a ticket to work voc rehab autism thing and she helps me check job sites and apply and reach out for jobs. But I kind of dread going back to work? Like I'm avoiding being ""tired"" being I feel really drained doing stuff I guess and like emotionally ""heavy"" but I know everyone has to suck it up and do it and I'm being lazy about it but I haven't really been working on getting a job on my own time even though I should. 

Every now and then I'll scroll indeed and get disheartened and like mope I guess but I'm not doing it daily like I should or working on learning employable skills like I should. I get  executive dysfunction apparently but I should be able to work through it I should learn how to accommodate and work around it and get to work anyways. But basically I've been on my ass for the past year and I'm an adult I can't just live off my parents. Even when I was working those temp jobs I'd gradually get less and less productive and get more disconnected and end up taking longer breaks than I should and crying even though it's easy work.

Last November I confessed to my mom about skipping classes and apparently being depressed so she brought me back as long as I go to therapy and work. 

Been doing therapy that's been great but progress is slow with only an hour a week and I have a job coach for a ticket to work voc rehab autism thing and she helps me check job sites and apply and reach out for jobs. But I kind of dread going back to work? Like I'm avoiding being ""tired"" being I feel really drained doing stuff I guess and like emotionally ""heavy"" but I know everyone has to suck it up and do it and I'm being lazy about it but I haven't really been working on getting a job on my own time even though I should. 

Every now and then I'll scroll indeed and get disheartened and like mope I guess but I'm not doing it daily like I should or working on learning employable skills like I should. I get  executive dysfunction apparently but I should be able to work through it I should learn how to accommodate and work around it and get to work anyways. But basically I've been on my ass for the past year and I'm an adult I can't just live off my parents. Even when I was working those temp jobs I'd gradually get less and less productive and get more disconnected and end up taking longer breaks than I should and crying even though it's easy work. 

It's not just me who needs me to work though this economy sucks so someday I'll have to support my parents and if my parents aren't able to support my younger siblings I'll have to be in the role my parents are for me now so I can't just take the work a wage slave job and live in a studio life route I have to actually apply myself.

131,1dh0jbo,WIBTA if I accepted money from my family?,"Half of my (18F) family (primarily uncle, aunt, grandma) lives in China, where it's a strong tradition on New Years for the younger generation to pay respects to the older family members and in return they give younger people red envelopes with bits of money inside.

For context, my family has been trying to follow this tradition for the past 18 years but my mom always aggressively turns them down. She has a poor relationship with money and a really big guilt complex (about immigrating to the US + ""leaving behind"" her brother and mom + ""forcing"" him to take care of her mom more than she does). Because we live in the US, they have no way to give it directly to me and have to go along with her rejections (but seem genuinely upset to be turned down).

We just came back from visiting my relatives in China, and a few of them tried to give me red envelopes of money as a graduation present/congratulations for getting into college present (and also probably for all of these past New Years). It's not an insane amount of money (a few thousand Yen = a few hundred US dollars from each of them) but it's also not insignificant. They are all nicely retired w/ pensions and have a good amount of savings (aka this money will not impact their lives, it's truly just a present).

I let him go on his rant about how he was writing me a ticket and was going to give me a warning since I just got in my car. As he was pulling off I muttered “Jackass” and he immediately stopped his car and pulled up about 20 ft blocking the entire one way. He tried to get my attention and get me to stop but I pulled away on to the street right before where he parked and got out. I saw him snap a picture of my plate as I was pulling off.

This guy has no legal authority to detain me. I kinda feel like I was wrong.

To start this off, I already have 3 cats. I had a dog who passed away suddenly and tragically in October of 2023. He was my baby and I miss him so much and think about him everyday. My grandmother also had a dog pass away shortly after due to old age.

My grandmother had a friend (Lisa) with a couple cats and a dog. Recently, said friend has had health complications and sadly passed away. She has a daughter (Cameron) who couldn't take the animals due to living 8 hours away in a rented apartment. What we didn't know was that she had asked my grandmother to take care of her animals if anything happened to her. My grandmother agreed without talking about it with any of us at the house so now we gained an extra 2 cats and her dog.

We have no problem taking in the two cats, seeing as we already have three. But, none of us wanted the dog and my grandmother said she would be the one to look after it and have the responsibility of it. She had not been taking care of the dog at all. He would use the bathroom all over our house, and she wouldn't have food or water out for him. So in the end, it was us who had to take care of the dog.

About 2 weeks later, my grandmother moved out. She did NOT take this dog even though she agreed it would be hers. She has left us with this dog that none of us wanted in the first place. I have been the one taking care of this dog by myself. And personally, I'm not emotionally ready to deal with another dog so soon after my dogs death. And on top of that, this dog needs medication from the vet that we cannot afford.

Cameron has actually moved into the area. I have tried talking to my parents about giving this dog back to her but it caused a heated argument between me and my dad. He thinks it would be wrong to give back the dog since her mom just passed away. I get where he's coming from but the dog was just dumped onto us, especially me since I'm the one taking care of it now. I really don't want this dog and think we should give him back or find someone to take him. AITAH?

138,1dgzkrs,AITA for telling my dad it isn’t the thought that counts.,"I’m fully prepared to be called the asshole.

My dad has this habit of offering to get you something and then bringing back something else, or a different version of the same thing. He won’t call and ask you what else you want if the item isn’t there, he will just assume you will be fine with whatever he gets.

A few weeks ago we went out shopping for groceries as my mum was away, she had put her favourite dip on the shopping list and wrote down exactly what brand it was. Dad couldn’t seem to find the dip and so decided to grab a random green dip and hope for the best, when i pointed out that the dip mum wanted was on the shelf above he grabbed it and seemed shocked that he didn’t see it.
Things like this are a regular occurrence and we kinda expect to get something different whenever he offers to get us something.
He never reads the containers or bottles and just grabs stuff at random most of the time.

Last night dad called me and asked me if I wanted anything from the liquor store as he was grabbing some wine, I said “can you please get me (brand) in raspberry please” he brings home the pineapple flavour and only realises it’s wrong when I point it out. 
Oh and he also got annoyed when I didn’t want to drink it as I dislike pineapple.

He tells me it’s the thought that counts even if he fucked up. That’s when I told him that it isn’t the thought that counts when you repeatedly get the wrong thing. This started a mini argument where I had to explain to him that he needs to actually take the time and make sure he gets the right thing and call us if he can’t get it.


I seem to have hurt his feelings and he told me I was being ungrateful and rude.

139,1dgzjlo,AITA for replacing my best friend in a RP group,"Hi! So this post will get a little nerdy, but I feel so bad and I really need some judgement here.

So a couple months ago my best friend, Sabrina, decided to recruit me into a VRChat Warhammer 40k role play group. For the people who don't understand anything I just said, VRChat is a game on the VR meant for socializing and playing fun little games with your friends. I can't really explain Warhammer super well, but the idea is that you are a part of an army that fights wars and stuff. I know, super nerdy.

Anyway, Sabrina needed more people and I was looking for friends, so I joined. Well, she took me under her wing and taught me everything I needed to know. Now, her role in the group is ""Chief of the Apothecarion"", which means that she is one of the big people is charge and also is in charge of all of the ""Hospitallers"" (Which are basically the guys who heal people in our chapter). I joined her sub-group and became a Hospitaller, my only goal was to make her proud.

Well, over time I became super integrated in the group, ranked up, and actually became friends with the guy who owns it and most of high command. I was just having a good time. Then, the trouble started when I was given the opportunity to join a group with-in the group that was basically considered ""the best of the best"" combat wise. I was elated! My best friend seemed happy for me, but starting around then she gradually pulled away from the group. 

She skipped our trainings and meet-ups and was just always busy, which was difficult because she, as a member of high command, had the responsibility of recruiting more members and now that wasn't getting done, among other things. I could tell the other members of high command were also pretty upset at her absences as well. Then one day she proposed she start her own group and merge it with ours. That never ended up happening, but from then on they looked for a replacement and eventually their eyes landed on me.

I mean I did get super close with them so I understand why, and I was super happy to be considered, but I had this guilt about taking her position. Things moved a little fast after that, they demoted her and plopped me right in her position and shortly after she left the group. I talked to her when she left and she said to me, ""You are good, I'm not mad at you, but let me give you some advice now that you are filling my shoes. Don't recruit someone who you know can take your position if you value where you have gotten yourself."" And I now just feel awful. I don't know what to do, I was just having fun, and people are telling me I am in the right and that I didn't do anything wrong, but I don't feel that way.

At the first complex, there were two apartments we wanted to check out, but the leasing agent said one was under maintenance that we couldn't see the inside.

Suddenly, the maintence guy comes out and so my mom asked the guy if it was okay for us to take around inside.

As we leave, we went back to the leasing office, thanked the leasing agent and everything seemed okay. Fifteen minutes later, the leasing agent called and basically complained angrly that we weren't supposed to go inside the unit. I told her that I understood and was sorry, but that the maintenance person was there and gave us permission. She said that ""the maintenance person was uncomfortable saying no"" and that it was a liability for the company. I basically apologized and said I understood.

142,1dgzeu1,WIBTA for telling my dad his girlfriend is not invited to our father’s day lunch plans?,"I (22f) invited my dad over for lunch at my house for father’s day. It was supposed to be my fiancé, our two sons (3years and 7months), myself, and my dad. My dad stopped by this evening to drop some things off for the babies and, as he was leaving, mentioned how excited his girlfriend (we will call her Melanie) was to meet the boys. It caught me off guard, so I didn’t even acknowledge it. I panicked. 

For some background, my parents divorced 8 years ago because my dad was cheating on my mom with Melanie. My dad and Melanie were only together for about 8 months before breaking up. They were absolutely insane together. The most toxic relationship you can imagine and they both fueled the fire. They only rekindled their relationship less than 2 months ago. 

I have expressed my concerns to my dad several times, but he seems to be a little delusional. He has even told our extended family that I fully support this relationship, but those words have never left my mouth. I have set some boundaries stating I would not like to see her until at least 6 months into their relationship and ONLY if they can prove they will be healthy and stable this time. I don’t want her to meet my children if this is going to end badly. I don’t think he thinks I am serious. 

I’m sure Melanie is a wonderful person. I don’t really know her. I was a young teen when my parents divorced and I never even gave her a chance before things got bad. After living a little more life and gaining more knowledge and experience I know that some people just bring out the worst in each other. Maybe that was the case here. I would hate to make this seem like I have a personal vendetta against her. I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I never invited her though. In my opinion, they haven’t been together long enough for her invitation to have been implied. 

I have spent a lot of money both as an adult and as a child getting my dad out of bad situations and I have spent a lot of time and energy trying to “save” him from himself. I can’t do it again. I have a family of my own now. I have chosen to distance myself from this situation, but I feel like he is blatantly ignoring me.

Recently, I found out that my ex-wife has been using a large portion of this money to fund vacations with her new boyfriend. They just came back from a week-long trip to Disney World, and this isn’t the first time they’ve splurged on lavish trips. Meanwhile, my kids have mentioned that they often eat ramen noodles for dinner and that their shoes are getting too small. In response to this she bought them dollar store flip flops that fell apart the same day.

I was furious when I heard this. I felt betrayed and couldn't stand the thought of my kids being neglected while she was off having fun. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. In a fit of rage, I told my ex-wife that I would be withholding child support until she could prove the money was being spent on the kids. She didn’t take me seriously, so I went a step further.

Last weekend, I picked up the kids for my regular visitation. Instead of taking them home on Sunday, I kept them with me and sent my ex-wife a message saying that she wouldn’t see the kids again until she refunded the money she wasted on vacations and could prove she was spending child support correctly. I know this was extreme, but I felt desperate and wanted to protect my kids from her irresponsibility.

My ex-wife is now threatening to call the police and take me to court for kidnapping, but I genuinely believe that what I did was in the best interest of my children. I plan to take this to court to get a modification to ensure the money goes directly to the kids' needs.

We have moved quite a bit im the past few years and I finally put my foot down and had us move to where my family is from. I feel the children need some form of stability in their life and we need the support my family provides.  We purchased a home about 20 minutes from my parents and I usually feed the  animals, cook, clean, do laundry , fold laundry, make lunch/dinner and then go to my parents with the kids for while. When I say a while I mean leave our home at 3:30 and be back around 6. It is also not everyday but My parents live close to  park where I like to take my kids to play so it is frequent. Now here is the issue. My fiancee and I have been having arguments over me going to my parent house and using them for childcare everyday or when I run errands. He says I should be like most traditional wives and do my chores and just stay home , he says there is no need to be at my parents everyday or to leave the kids with them while I run errands. He has told me I need to stop being my mother’s daughter and act more like a wife.  my argument is that if they are willing to watch my kids so I can grocery shop in peace, why struggle.  We have had several other arguments and it has always led to him disrespecting me and me leaving the home for a few hours to have him cool down. I have tried talking to him about his recent behavior and he says it’s normal for couples to call each other names and argue. 
Most recently we have gotten into an argument that has led to me leaving the home and staying at my parents with my 3 kids. He is upset because I let our 2 year old daughter go to a party with my parents without consulting with him.  I told him it was not a major life event and she wasnt going to be gone for a long time so I didnt think there was a need to consult with him. He was very upset and started name calling and being very disrespectful. He said many hurtful things that I will not into detail but he said I did not take his input into consideration and made decisions on my own as if I was a single mother. initially he told me he did not want me in his home and I was no longer welcome there. He then said I could go back home but we would sleep in separate rooms. I told him I was not going back until he made an attempt to change. There was some back and forth and we ended up on not so friendly terms.  Now here is my question. Is he right in being this upset? Did I truly cross a line by not asking him if our daughter could attend a family gathering with my parents? I dont feel I am neglecting him as a fiancee because everything gets done but is he right, am I putting my parents before him?

146,1dgz0tr,WIBTA for getting close to someone my friends hate?,"(F15)So there's this kid I've known for a few years(M14), let's call him Jake. Jake and I did a play together when I was in 7th grade, and we both had lots of fun(he was in 6th.) In 8th grade, we did the school play again together. Everything seemed to be going great, but he started to get in trouble with the drama teacher a lot. She would always yell at him for making a mess, or for being too loud backstage. Everyone grew restless of him, and he just became the trouble maker. The play came and went, going fine. 

That summer I found out he was going to the same summer camp as me, one I'd been going to for 7 years. I was happy to see some other kids from the play too, not expecting any of them to come. One thing had changed though. Jake was kind of a dick. He was super competitive, and loved targeting my friends and I during games. He also started hating on all things theater, and said he hated all theater kids.

This year, we're going to the same summer camp again. He seemed like he hadn't changed on the first day, but soon after we were playing a game and he teamed up with me and was actually really sweet. I spent the rest of the week talking to him, and got to know more about him. I was disappointed to find out he wouldn't be joining me at my high school next year, and that he would be going to a private one. We got pretty comfortable with each other and I started asking him about what had happened in 8th grade (now about a year and a half ago.) 

By now almost all of my friends disliked or hated him, and we had all made the mistake to only listen to one story. All we knew was he was being a trouble maker, I didn't find out until yesterday that it wasn't his fault at all. One of my close friends was making him laugh backstage, and Jake tried to stop but my friend kept going and our teacher blamed Jake for it. She was unfair to Jake, blaming him for a lot of other things he didn't do too. 

I'm hoping to talk to him and get a bit closer to him over the next few days, but I know my friends will be mad at me if I do because he's now an outcast. He did say some bad things to them when he was mad, but some of it was justified. I don't want anyone to get hurt.

147,1dgxu0o,AITAH?  Our house is infested with ants and my parent refuse to do anything about it.,"Edit: my parents work full time with multiple jobs, and aren't really present during the day. I think I was hurtful in the way that I expressed my concern coming across as ungrateful and bratty. I called the house disgusting among other things and my parents took that personally. I feel bad for the way I worded it because I know how hard they work.


cockroaches invade our kitchen and bathroom floor while the ants get in the sink,dishwasher,food cabinets, and stove top. This happens every summer, and every summer I end up deep cleaning the whole house multiple times a month. Some summers it got so bad ants got into boxes of ceral and into bread packages. It was almost impossible for me to eat a snack with out having to drown the ants outside the packaging.My parents do clean, but they're not very good at it. Since I'm on summer break from school I don't mind helping out at all with cleaning, cooking, and washing but I feel like this is getting out of hand. Earlier today I was washing and drying dishes and noticed the dishes I place on the drying rack already had ants climbing around. I immediately drowned them and rewashed the dishes. As I was doing that my dad came into the kitchen and I mentioned the problem. He told me to leave it as it is and that nothing will happen. This bothered me and I told him that that's filthy and that I'm not going to be a slob. We argued back and fourth. I kept insisting that that's not okay and we need to do somthing about it. I told him we're infested. My dad responded ""this isnt infested were fine, if we were infested we wouldnt be able to live here"" and that ""your the only one bothered by this stop being to sensitive"" he also insisted it was okay beacuse ants don't carry disease. this bothered me again but it also made me think that I might have been overreacting. I decided to clean a little bit more after that since the kitchen was still messy. I noticed a plate of bacon left out there on the counter that was made this morning. I was going to throw it away but my dad raised his voice at me telling me not to throw it away and that it was fine. He said if i like it or not its protien so its fine and to look it up. We argued a bit again and it ended with him telling me that ants come from the earth and it's fine and that im acting up and having a tantrum beacuse things aren't going my way. I feel stupid for even mentioning it now, but at the time I feel like I was in the right to be upset. Am I the a hole? I feel kinda helpless since I'm still a student with no job and no money so I can't find a solution myself. What should I do from here?

149,1dhiglr,AITA for asking my mother to stop taking photos of me before I leave the house?,"My mother and I (18F) have gotten into several arguments as I finished my senior year of high school. Now that it’s summer I am doing my last theater summer camp, and then I start work. 

My mother loves to take photos. Her camera roll is easily 50,000+. While this does irritate me from time to time, I have never asked her to not take photos of me. I understand that she loves pictures and enjoys making scrapbooks. 
What really frustrates me, is when she will stop me while I am walking out the door and asks for a photo. It happened when I was leaving for school on multiple occasions, and she has done it during the theatre camp I mentioned earlier. Even when I tell her I’m running late, she will stop me before I leave the house and make me take a photo. Her excuse is always, “I love your outfit and want a photo”. 

I have been having a hard time setting boundaries with my mother as I’m about to go to college. My most recent attempt was last weekend, after we had a fun outing, I finally worked up the courage to ask her to stop. I waited until she was in a good mood and jokingly said, “You’ve gotta stop taking photos of me before I leave. If I like my outfit, I have probably already taken a photo”. She eventually agreed after telling me how much she likes taking photos of me because she thinks I look cute. 

The very next day, I am waiting for my friend to pick me up so we can go out, and my mother stops me to take a picture. I let this incident go because I was wearing a pair of pants that I had finished crocheting. I had spent around six months working on the pants, so I understood why she wanted to take photos. I posed and let her take a few then said I had to go. 

She proceeded to stop me the next morning before camp to take photos because I was wearing the pants again. I told her we took photos yesterday. She started to get upset, so I said, “I asked you nicely to stop doing this. You’re disrespecting my request”. I tend to cry when I get up, so I was basically crying at this point. My mother was almost yelling at me calling me selfish because I know how much she loves photos. She walked out of the kitchen and slammed the door. She went three days without talking to me. 

This isn’t the first time she’s given me the silent treatment, but this was the longest. The only time she spoke to me was her yelling from down the stairs that I had to get up earlier because she wouldn’t be prepping any of my food.
