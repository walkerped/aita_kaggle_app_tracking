0,1di4nhn,AITA for kicking out a friend for accusing me of being in love with my ex? ,"My ex and I dated for a few years before she came out as as a trans woman and that lead to us breaking up. We have remained friends but I am having some complicated emotions and it has led me to want to distance myself from her. 

We have a lot of common friends and I was hanging out with one of them in my home and we were getting ready to have a few other friends over. I talked about my ex and my friend straight up accused me of having feelings for her! It is absurd. 

She then listed out a lot of dumb high shit, Apparently I hate all the people she dated, I try to look good whenever I know she is coming over and I always make space for her next to me? Like this is so stupid, it can all be explained by me being a little jealous during the break-up and us being close friends. 

It really broke my heart she would think that I'm in love with my ex and I kicked her out. She was very confused when I kicked her out and she said I was overreacting to something very silly and that I needed to get over my bullshit. 

I feel like shit and like a massive idiot. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-17,"AITA for kicking out a friend for accusing me of being in love with my ex?

1,1di2i0z,AITA if I tear up a book and use it for my art project?,"I (23 ftm) am working on moving to a new place and i was going through my stuff deciding what to keep what to throw away etc. Well I found a religious work book given to me by the pastor of a church I used to be a part of. I didn't know what to do with it but I didn't want to throw it because I felt bad.

You see not long ago I joined a church (sorta) during a bad time in my life. My mom was in a mental hospital and I didn't how to take of myself (I was 21 at the time.) so a pastor and his wife, let call them M and E, who were involved with my brother, decided to help me. For some context I am a nonbinary trans man. I am not fully out, my brother and mother know and both are supportive tho my brother is better with gendering me correctly. I knew how churches could be bigoted but I really needed help so I didn't come out to them. Fast forward a bit and I decided to become a part of the church because I was lonely. I had no friends and had no way to leave the house on my own. They were very nice to me but pretending to be not trans was hurting me. I kept it down though because I didn't want to not have a community. I also foolishly believed I could endear myself to them and then come out and they would accept me. Fast forward and I decided to go on a trip to this church camp weekend thing. It went well at first but obviously having to pretend was still exhausting especially since now I couldn't be myself in private. Fast forward again towards near of the trip and I had one of worse conversations with E.

You see her and daughter had recently started working at the same place I work and there I was going by a different name that was also masculine. I thought nothing of it but she apparently she didn't. She basically told that being trans was a sin and that they qoute had 'live the way the Bible said.' I should have expected it but it still hurt. I decided right after I would leave the church and delete their numbers. I did but not before leaving a text expressing my gratitude for that their but that I needed to be myself. 

Now back to the work book. I have this work book because before leaving I became part of a group lead by M where we filled it out to bring us closer to god or something like that. I still have it because I don't want to talk to them again. I found it again while going through my stuff and it brought up bad memories. I didn't want to throw it away because I have an on going papier-mâché project I could use it for. Then I felt bad because I know these books cost money but I would literally rather eat my own foot then talk to them again.

2,1dhzf2e,AITA for not following the dresscode that wasn't directed at my 'gender',"I'm a 15 year old trans boy that goes to a super religious Catholic school run by nuns. They have very strict dresscodes (eg: girls being required to have their hair tied in braids and not being allowed to wear pants that show their ankles, boys being required to have short hair) The teachers weren't very happy about me cutting my hair short but there's nothing in the dresscode they couldhold against me. The front part of my hair is starting to get abitl long and i decided to leave it that way because it looked silly and cute to me, but last week I got stopped in a hallway by a nun who told me that if I was gonna dress and behave like a boy, I better start following their dresscode too. I am not out of the closet yet and am practically a still a girl to the outside eye, I still wear the girls' uniform and go by she/her pronouns, so I think it's a bit unfair to force me to follow the dresscode when Im still treated as a girl. My parents who usually stand up for me in situations like this, sided with the school, so did my friends. that left me wondering if i was just being a stubborn asshole.

3,1dhnbpe,AITA for not meeting my friends,"I (29F) have 2 friends (also 29F) who have rescheduled meeting up for 2 weeks now. Usually, I am understanding for reasons why, but the first reason was cause we hadn't collectively really thought of what to do (e.g., go out to eat, shop, have a picnic). For me, a catch-up or going out doesn't really require an intensive plan unless you're trying to go somewhere fancy or currently trendy on tiktok. So the next weekend rolls by, and not one of my friends thinks of a plan or to even suggest anything. I had suggested multiple things even in the first week, but the weather was kinda shitty so we decided to just reschedule. Plus, no one seemed committed to any of the options I mentioned. Day of our meet-up, and they weren't even awake before NOON. They are both 29 y.o, its a Sunday and the sun is also out. Which means it's just perfect to go out and meet each other. To make matters worse, I had suggested a place, and they both drive, always preaching to me it makes it easier for them, but they can not drive their little butt 30-40min out to the place you mention. I would have been easily travelling double that as a public transport girly to get to some locations simply cause I want to go and I like the person. It makes it so annoying that they won't do the same. All I'm saying is, don't own a car if you're so lazy to drive it, or are they just so selfish that they don't want to see friends the moment it gets a little inconvenient? Who owns a car to literally only want to drive out MAX a 15-20min radius from where they live? Are they scared they'll get lost or something? Like what the heck? If it's all too much for them, then why do I even put in effort to this friendship when they won't? They also joined forces in the group chat, saying they can't take public transport either cause they hate it and its a bother too, and that's why they drive everywhere but won't DRIVE? LIKE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. It just seems like they have never and won't explore further than the road they live on. They clearly don't care about meeting if they only want to stay local and not travel out to different locations. I am so annoyed at these types of people who won't put in an effort to see you, no matter how short notice it is. I can leave my house past noon, why can't you?

Shortly after, the same friends suggest a short dog walk around where they live, cause they both own a dog, but thing is, you don't even own a dog. So I'm just meant to accompany you guys on a walk like some extra? They have been very inconsiderate. Then they say ""Oh but you could still walk with us?"", well what if I don't want to? Because I can't join into the day without entertaining YOUR dogs. You see where this is going? it's only been about YOU.

4,1dhnawg,AITA for leaving my friends birthday party,"My (23m) bf and I (22f) got invited to our close friend (f) 21st birthday party. The plan was changed 4 times and we were sent 4 different itinerary’s for 4 different places. 

We inquired more about this event, who’s going how much, when etc and found out it would be $360 for overnight accommodations per person, $720 total between my bf and I. We get the final plan, it is over an hour away in an expensive costal town in another state. Decided ~if~ it happened we would go for one afternoon/evening and go home after to avoid paying for overnight accommodations, our other friend who is also invited decides he will join us. 

We get the guest list and it is no one we know but all of her older sisters friends, bf, bfs roommates are invited. 

The plan for when we arrived was to meet for dinner and then go to a few bars after. However when we got there and texted her we were coming to meet up she informed the three of us the actually moved their reservation up and dinner was now over and they have moved to a bar. Fine. We head to the bar wait in line get to the front, there is a $45 cover and we don’t have enough cash. Fine. We need to find an atm and something to eat since dinner was now over. 

We grab a quick bite to eat and some cash and head back. The line at this point to get into the bar is over 2 hours. We text our friend asking if we can meet her at the next bar on the list. She tells us she likes the vibes at this bar and doesn’t plan on leaving for another 2 hours or so. We explain to her by the time we wait in line she will be leaving so we will just go now to the next bar and meet her after.

At this point she tells us to go home she doesn’t care anymore we should leave. So we walk to the car. When we get in the car she calls our friend again and goes ballistic that she’s crying we’re being difficult and confusing.

5,1dhn83w,AITA airing out my grievances about my roommates right before I move out?,"Since August last year, I (22F) have been living in a house with 4 other girls: Fran (24), Kate (21), Elle (20), and Becky (26). I would say that I'm closest with Fran, and Becky is quite close with Kate. Fran and I are both moving out in a few weeks. At Thanksgiving, Becky got together with Nina (27F). Nina had been living with her boyfriend and now needed somewhere to stay. Becky said she was moving in with her parents, but a few days later, Nina's boxes were coming into the house for ""storage"" and she was at the house 4-5 nights/week.

A few months later, Nina was a regular presence at the house and had her own keys. Fran and I both felt put out about this, and Fran spoke to Becky privately via text about it at Christmas. I was mentioned in these texts and had a conversation with Becky after she said that she was feeling put out by me letting Fran speak for me. These conversations didn't amount to much. 

Kate has recently been bringing over her boyfriend, sister, and her parents' dog. Before we moved in together, we discussed communication regarding overnight guests. There is even a whiteboard in the kitchen for them to be written down. Becky and Kate used to use it.

I'm an avoidant person, but felt like I owed it to myself to speak up even 6 months late. I sent a message in the group chat and tried to keep it light. I made it clear that I wasn't expecting any changes in behavior - I just wanted to get things off my chest. I expressed my discomfort with keys being given out. Fran and Elle responded favorably. Becky and Kate did not. For context, the previous day I had asked for communication regarding overnight guests and new pets, so the vibe was already off. 

Becky and Kate said that this conversation should've been had in person - which I can agree with to a point - but we've said that we would have house meetings before, and they never happened. I explained that I thought texting would lessen everyone's stress and give people time to think over their responses.

The sentiment from Kate was basically ""I don't care how you feel, I'm not changing my behavior."" She said that I wanted to monitor who comes into the house and that she wouldn’t report to me. I got the same response from Becky (albeit less aggressively phrased) in addition to being blamed for causing the issue by not speaking up sooner. Things devolved in the group chat, to the point where Elle felt the need to delete the chat entirely. When I said that I thought it was commonly understood that keys shouldn't be given out to people not on the lease, Becky said that wasn't a valid assumption and that I needed to explicitly state that it made me uncomfortable.

In the end, the landlord got involved and shared lease conditions that backed my and Fran's position. It also came to light that Becky had asked the landlord if she could add Nina to the lease now - without talking to me or Fran about it.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA airing out my grievances about my roommates right before I move out?

6,1dhn6dg,AITA for refusing to repay my dad?,"I'm a university student studying Engineering. I live with my parents, and I don't have a job on account of me being a full-time student. I've needed a new laptop for a while, but the fact that I'm now working with Solidworks (3D modeling software) meant that my dad made a deal with me: He'd pay for a laptop and I'd pay him back when I got a job during the summer. I agreed, a laptop was purchased (cost of \~$2,000), and I sent him $500 (half of my savings at the time) to prove that I fully intended to pay him back. He made it clear that, until I paid him back, the laptop was essentially on-loan from him.

Fast forward to a few months ago. The laptop had always run on the hotter side, but now it was thermal throttling when I tried to do anything with it. I did some troubleshooting, consulted the internet, and came to the conclusion that the thermal paste was either poorly applied or had dried up. For those who don't know, if a laptop can't cool itself down, it stops working as hard so it doesn't overheat and fry itself from the inside. This is called thermal throttling, and thermal paste is really important to prevent it. If it's left unchecked, the laptop would continue to overheat, get slower, and eventually fail to start up.

I explained this to my dad and said that I could open up the laptop and re-apply the thermal paste myself. I previously worked at a PC repair shop, so I knew this would take me about an hour and cost maybe $10 (the cost of the new thermal paste). He refused. I offered to take it to a repair shop and they can re-apply the thermal paste. I also offered to either pay for the repair myself or he can add it to my tab (that I still intended to repay). He refused saying that he doesn't want to open up the laptop and risk damaging it until I had fully paid it off. I tried to explain how bad this could get and how easily I could fix it, but he was set in his decision.

Fast forward to yesterday morning. I tried starting up the laptop, and it was unresponsive. I tried to troubleshoot the issue, but it was totally bricked. I informed my dad about this and explained that I would no longer be paying him for the remainder of the laptop. He demanded to know why I would do that, and I explained that he knew there was an issue with the laptop that could potentially cause serious damage, and not only did he ignore the issue, he shot down all of my recommendations and offers to fix it. As far as I'm concerned, he loaned me a laptop, then let it overheat and die. He called me a snake and said that I had 24 hours to repay him my remaining debt (\~$1,500) or he'd kick me out. We exchanged some harsh words, and he stormed out of the house.

My mom assured me that I won't be kicked out, but that I really should hold up my end of the deal and pay him back, albeit with more than a day to do so. I think that I'm in the right, but I can't help but feel like I just cheated my dad out of $1,500. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for refusing to repay my dad?

For those who don't know, if a laptop can't cool itself down, it stops working as hard so it doesn't overheat and fry itself from the inside. This is called thermal throttling, and thermal paste is really important to prevent it. If it's left unchecked, the laptop would continue to overheat, get slower, and eventually fail to start up.

I explained this to my dad and said that I could open up the laptop and re-apply the thermal paste myself. I previously worked at a PC repair shop, so I knew this would take me about an hour and cost maybe $10 (the cost of the new thermal paste). He refused. I offered to take it to a repair shop and they can re-apply the thermal paste. I also offered to either pay for the repair myself or he can add it to my tab (that I still intended to repay). He refused saying that he doesn't want to open up the laptop and risk damaging it until I had fully paid it off. I tried to explain how bad this could get and how easily I could fix it, but he was set in his decision.

Fast forward to yesterday morning. I tried starting up the laptop, and it was unresponsive. I tried to troubleshoot the issue, but it was totally bricked. I informed my dad about this and explained that I would no longer be paying him for the remainder of the laptop. He demanded to know why I would do that, and I explained that he knew there was an issue with the laptop that could potentially cause serious damage, and not only did he ignore the issue, he shot down all of my recommendations and offers to fix it. As far as I'm concerned, he loaned me a laptop, then let it overheat and die. He called me a snake and said that I had 24 hours to repay him my remaining debt (\~$1,500) or he'd kick me out. We exchanged some harsh words, and he stormed out of the house.

My mom assured me that I won't be kicked out, but that I really should hold up my end of the deal and pay him back, albeit with more than a day to do so. I think that I'm in the right, but I can't help but feel like I just cheated my dad out of $1,500. AITA?",0.0,1.0421213,1,0
7,1dhmp1i,AITAH For Not Allowing my Wife to Drink?,"I know the title sounds like I am starring in a sitcom in the ‘50s but it isn’t like that I promise. 

For context; before I met my wife she was a self proclaimed alcoholic and drug addict who was addicted to some pretty bad drugs. A couple months before we met she decided to quit using drugs and went to NA meetings to help her with her sobriety. After her first meeting she went to a bar and got drunk. After some time she also decided to quit alcohol. Since then the only drugs she uses are nicotine and delta 8. She has been sober for years at this point.

Context for me; I have always been against alcohol because I don’t like the way it tastes or the way it makes me feel. Also I think it makes others make bad decisions and I don’t like being in a state of mind where I can make bad decisions. I am not against drugs and used to use marijuana and psychedelics commonly. At the point of meeting my wife up to now I have only used nicotine. I met my wife on a dating app where one of the reasons I wanted to meet her was because she stated that she was sober. I thought it would be nice to be in a relationship where I didn’t have to DD for the other person or take care of them when they are drunk or high like I have had to do in past relationships. 

Now for the asshole of me. We had a baby about a year ago and it was really hard on her. She had bad post partum depression after a high risk and not great pregnancy. We have a beautiful baby boy who we both love and her depression is mostly gone. Sometimes he can still be a huge handful and some doctors have told us that we need to watch for autism in him. Recently my wife has been talking about how nice it would be to have a glass of wine at the end of the day. That’s fair considering how hard she has it being a stay at home mom but I had assumed she was just venting and reminiscing. 

That is, until she asked me if I would be okay if she did drink wine at the end of the day on hard days. I told her that I wouldn’t be comfortable with that considering her past addiction issues and I explained to her how I feel about alcohol. She acquiesced but was obviously unhappy about my reaction. 

I feel like an asshole because it is her body and she should be able to do what she wants with it. I am mostly just scared she will fall into old habits but I am also definitely coming at it with a selfish perspective.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITAH For Not Allowing my Wife to Drink?

now, he's just working on cosmetic stuff,  specifically painting it himself. he bought spray cans and then asked me if i would help him shake them up. at first i said no, because i didn't feel like it. he explained that it wouldn't take that much time or effort on my part, so i  agreed.

as the day to paint gets closer, he's asked me if i'll also stand outside with a sheet of cardboard while he paints so that paint doesn't get on the neighbor's car. i said no because that would be both tiring and boring for me, and there are other ways i'd rather spend my weekend.

this sparked a fight between us, with him insisting that i'm being an asshole for not wanting to help him and me insisting that it's unfair of him to be angry with me for not wanting to spend my free time on his hobby. (i do some gig work a few hours a day on weekdays, and am responsible for all of the cooking, cleaning, etc.)

11,1dhmeex,AITA for Refusing to Reveal the Identity of an Anonymous Survey Respondent?,"TL;DR: I allowed a club member to submit a survey anonymously to encourage honest feedback. When the board reviewed the responses, one critical anonymous survey upset ""Dee,"" who demanded to know the respondent's identity. I refused, believing in the importance of anonymity for honest feedback. Dee insists anonymity wasn’t guaranteed and accuses me of lacking integrity. AITA for not revealing the respondent?

Hi

I recently sent out surveys to the members of a small group I'm part of to gather feedback on how the year went. One member approached me, the club president, and asked if they could submit their survey anonymously. Believing that anonymity encourages honest feedback without fear of reprisal, I allowed it.

When the board reviewed the survey responses, one stood out. It was passionate and expressed frustration with certain activities, stating that they felt uncomfortable with how things were being run. Despite the strong feelings, the feedback contained no threats or personal attacks.

However, the person responsible for organizing those activities, let’s call her Dee, got upset. Instead of addressing the concerns raised, she immediately demanded to know who submitted the survey. Since this was the only anonymous submission, I knew who it was. But I believe people should be able to give feedback without fear of reprisal, and Dee’s reaction only reinforced this belief. I refused to reveal the name.

This refusal made Dee even more upset. She emailed me the next morning, accusing me of lacking integrity and insisting that I tell her who submitted the survey. I stood my ground, explaining that anonymity in surveys is crucial for honest feedback and that revealing the respondent’s identity would violate my ethics and self-respect.

Dee argued that, as someone who served with me on the board for three years, she deserved my respect and should always know who submits feedback. She believes those administering surveys need to know the respondents’ names to address issues directly. Additionally, she recalled being asked for input on the survey's content and stated, ""Therefore, I believe that this is not a personal endeavor of any one member of the board. At no point was anonymity guaranteed to anyone filling out the survey, and, by that, I mean remaining anonymous to those who had a hand in developing the survey. Of course, the views should not be shared beyond the boundaries of the board. Also, this is not a matter of your personal ethics. Although developed principally by you, this has been a board process and, if you disagree, then you were out of line to involve members of the board in refining it.""

It's worth noting that the survey had a spot for names, which I felt discouraged members from submitting honest feedback or expressing their true concerns. My request was to set the questions asked on the survey and gather information to help the club learn from the past year.

I don't feel that I stepped out of line. Their feedback helped develop the questions needed for the survey. And while no guarantee of anonymity was on the survey, there was no mention that it wasn't.

I own my apartment and I have one unit above mine, a few years ago the wax seal of their toilet broke and needless to say I suffered a fair amount of water damage and my ceiling had to be repaired pretty extensively in my bathroom.

He constantly infantilises me. Anytime I try to do something he has to go on this rant about how to do the simple thing. I'll try to wipe the table and he makes sure I know that I need to use cleaner, that sort of thing. Whenever my mother tells me something he repeats it word for word, and when I act annoyed by this and ask him to stop, he claims that I'm taking away his right to an opinion and his voice. He also does petty things, he'll buy me food and when I don't eat it ""quick enough"" he'll eat it, but to prove a point, he will leave one bite of the thing in the box. Anytime I try to tell him I'm annoyed he says something like ""you ate my little Caesars! We are even"" when I did not know the Little Caesars was his, and I did not leave only one bite, I left a sustainable amount in the box.

I'm really fed up and I want to call him out on it, but I don't want to seem like an asshole, and I don't want to be petty over things that aren't a big deal. So WIBTA",,0.0201838,0,0
15,1dhm2wk,WIBTA If I asked my roommates for money to cover groceries?,"WIBTA if I asked my roommates for money to cover groceries?

I am a 45yo slightly physically disabled woman currently living with some friends (my best friend at the time and his unemployed nephew) that came to my aid when I needed a place to go after being evicted from my trailer. That was a rough month. I lost my job, car and home within 3 weeks of each other. within a month or two of moving in with them, I found a job working at Home Depot and have been there ever since. It's not GREAT pay but I was working on saving up to move into an apartment or something.

Then about 6 months ago, I started noticing the groceries i was buying for myself were going missing. I have memory issues, so I thought maybe I was eating them and forgetting? Then I started noticing that the boxes and cans were opened different ways than to what I usually do so that confirmed it wasn't me. So, I confronted my roommate and asked him if he'd been the one getting into the stuff and if so, that's fine, I would just like some notice and maybe a little cash to cover what they ate. nothing. 

Now, normally I wouldn't say anything, but I figured out that it was his nephew taking the food and I mean...he blew through a 10lb bag of rice in 2 weeks. And it's not like he would save any of it. there was rice in the bottom of the pan he made it in that he could've put in the fridge for leftovers, but he let it go to waste. It angers me because he's not a child, he's a 24-year-old grown ass man who should know better.

  
 BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE:

To put things in perspective, about 3 months ago, I lost my Medicaid because according to them, I was making too much money working at HD and I'm not paying bills (except my phone) because that was the agreement so I could try to save up. I have two types of insulin i'm on, plus thyroid and anti-psychotic/depressant meds that are NOT cheap. i've spent more on meds and food in the last 3 months than i have in the last year so whatever I had saved up I had to spend on that.

I started putting my non-perishables in a milk crate under my bed to keep him from taking it but that didn't stop him. He broke into my room, went under my bed, found the crate and took half of my food and ate it himself. So now I keep what food I can in my car, which is a whole other issue especially with the current weather getting warmer. Also, for context, the car I currently have is a 1999 Toyota Camry with 180k miles on it, the trunk is being held together by electrical tape, it needs extensive exhaust system work done on it, and the rear bumper is missing from an accident that had happened before the car came into my possession.

20,1dhlweb,AITAH for making a comment about my gf lipstick color?,"Hi reddit,

I love my gf to death and I think the world of her.

we are on vacation in Mexico to celebrate her birthday and we’ve been taking pictures left and right of her.  

One night we find a restaurant to sit at and eat, and we started going through the pictures we’ve taken.

 She gets to one of them and says oh I really like that one, what do you think about my lipstick color?

Normally my opinion is whatever makes you happy sweetie, but this time for some odd reason i just wanted to answer the question.

I say something along the lines of, it’s a dark red lipstick and i think it blends in with your skin…meaning no contrast.

She completely shuts down the rest of the dinner, and i’m trying to figure out why.

when we step out of the restaurant she explodes, accusing me of being colorist and not liking her skin color. she says it really hurt her feelings. 

I understand it hurt her feelings, but the way she just started accusing me of almost being racist got me instantly on the defensive. Because I didn’t say anything about her skin color but more so why does my girlfriend think I’m this nasty person.  I DO NOT hate my gf skin color, she’s beautiful. I would not be in Mexico with her if i didn’t like her skin.

Anyways, we leave the restaurant and walk 25 minutes back to our Airbnb and she does not say a word to me though entire time. When we get home, we start getting ready for bed and I noticed my girlfriend is locked in on her phone.

I ask her what’s up? What are you doing? To which she responds in my shock that her two male friends think that her skin is perfect. 

At this point, I’m pissed because I didn’t say anything about her skin color, but more so i’m pissed at fact that she already told two people, I don’t really like these guys and haven’t met them, about the situation and put words in my mouth.

We get into an argument because i told her I do not like when WE don’t fix the problem, and she goes/uses other men to cope. she ends up locking me out of the room.

I feel real bad that I offended my girlfriend’s feelings and immediately apologized and explained myself, but she went to other guys to talk about our problems….and she’s painting me as the asshole to others…

TLDR: I told my girlfriend I don’t like her lipstick color, she took it as I don’t like her skin color, and then proceeded to push me away when I was trying to resolve.

23,1dhllp3,AITA for not reaching out? ,"I (22f) had been friends with Adam (22m) for 3 years. We met in college during our freshman year (I helped him with something on campus), and he was introduced to a friend group I was also in. This includes Beth (27f) and Carrie (24f).

Adam was my dorm roommate for 2 years. Because of how long we had been living with each other, we had made plans to become roommates in our city after I graduated. He mentioned me paying for majority rent since he would be a student still, and I would be working full time. I had an extremely busy schedule during school, I worked two part-time jobs, had a full class load, and wanted to improve my relationships with my peers in my classes (wanted to make more friends!). I rarely went back to my dorm, and he only made it clear that my schedule upset him months into this ordeal. 

In October, my brother was asking to live with me for a few days a week in my city after I graduate. He was getting a job opportunity somewhere. He couldn't afford another place on his own, and his wife didn't want to move. I took a few days to think about it before speaking with Adam. I told him all I knew at the time. My brother was asking for my help and I intended to help him. Family comes first, and I've always been clear about it with all my friends (especially since my oldest brother had passed). Adam didn't take it very well. After some silence. he only told me he was mad at me. I said ‘I’m sorry’, and he left. 

For a week afterwards, he didn't speak to me, and I had assumed he didn't want to speak to me to sort his own thoughts. He also didn't speak to Carrie or Beth in our server (all four of us would be active daily). After a week, I initiated a conversation. Three main points were made during this talk, 1 I shouldn’t ‘let him go silent, because he could go the rest of his life without speaking to us’. 2 He isn’t obligated to reach out to anyone. 3 I am a bad friend. I’m not fantastic at articulating my thoughts, so I didn’t have much to say. I was hurt, and asked to continue the conversation a different day before I said something I regret. We didn't speak again until after Christmas break.

Before this point, I spoke with Carrie and Beth about it all. I didn’t shy away from the fact that I didn’t reach out to him. They pointed out that, whenever they reach out, they get snapped at by him. That was the case for all 2 years we've known him. 

After Christmas (all three of us got him gifts), I tried to speak to him again. During this conversation, he insulted Beth, and said he only reached out to her when she was hospitalized because she had been starting conversations with him first. He said that I ‘should have recognized he was in a bad mood before I said anything about my brother’. His treatment of our friends made me upset, to the point that I decided that my graduating, senior year thesis and jobs were more important than trying to resolve this. We haven’t spoken since.

My brother was asking for my help and I intended to help him. Family comes first, and I've always been clear about it with all my friends (especially since my oldest brother had passed). Adam didn't take it very well. After some silence. he only told me he was mad at me. I said ‘I’m sorry’, and he left. 

For a week afterwards, he didn't speak to me, and I had assumed he didn't want to speak to me to sort his own thoughts. He also didn't speak to Carrie or Beth in our server (all four of us would be active daily). After a week, I initiated a conversation. Three main points were made during this talk, 1 I shouldn’t ‘let him go silent, because he could go the rest of his life without speaking to us’. 2 He isn’t obligated to reach out to anyone. 3 I am a bad friend. I’m not fantastic at articulating my thoughts, so I didn’t have much to say. I was hurt, and asked to continue the conversation a different day before I said something I regret. We didn't speak again until after Christmas break.

Before this point, I spoke with Carrie and Beth about it all. I didn’t shy away from the fact that I didn’t reach out to him. They pointed out that, whenever they reach out, they get snapped at by him. That was the case for all 2 years we've known him. 

After Christmas (all three of us got him gifts), I tried to speak to him again. During this conversation, he insulted Beth, and said he only reached out to her when she was hospitalized because she had been starting conversations with him first. He said that I ‘should have recognized he was in a bad mood before I said anything about my brother’. His treatment of our friends made me upset, to the point that I decided that my graduating, senior year thesis and jobs were more important than trying to resolve this. We haven’t spoken since.

24,1dhlkj8,AITA for accusing my cousin's inclusivity of being performative and fake?,"Before I start I just want to inform that English is not my first language so I apologize in advance if I say anything that's incoherent 
I (16F) have a cousin (19M) who I'll call Jason. Jason is a very progressive person,  which has never been a problem since our family is not conservative, but there's a thing about Jason that I find extremely annoying. 

Jason defends the rights of women, queer people, people of color and people with disabilities, which, again, awesome stuff, I support it, but at the same time he says people shouldn't be excluded from society because of their disabilities he's constantly excluding and mistreating my little brother (8M) who has a learning disability, he actively refuses to participate in any family event if he knows my brother will be there and when he can't avoid my brother in a way he gets extremely moody and rude to everyone. 
And it's not like my brother is a difficult child to deal with, I know I can sound biased because I'm his sister but he's genuinely just a quiet boy who keeps to himself and rarely interacts with people outside of the family, the only time he has tantrums is when he's teased which rarely ever happens, so I don't see why Jason despises him so much. 

He even straight up missed his mom's birthday because my brother was in the party too, after that I finally had enough and the next day i confronted him about his behavior but he just completely denied ever excluding my brother and even said him and I were always hanging out when we were younger and because I'm autistic that means he doesn't mistreat disabled people.

I told him his argument didn't make any sense and that all his inclusivity discourse he's always talking about is performative and not what he really thinks deep inside, because how can he rant nonstop about how we should include disabled people in society if he's not willing to even exist in the same place as a disabled kid, he obviously didn't appreciate it and refused to talk to me after that.

25,1dhlhr0,AITA for Selling the House and Creating Tension with My Parent?,"Hi everyone,

It’s been almost two years since I (30M) last spoke to my parent. Here's the backstory:

About three years ago, my parent and I decided to buy a small townhouse together. The agreement was that I would pay the mortgage, and they would cover other expenses like rates, body corporate fees, electricity, and food. My dad gifted me $30,000 (AUD) for the deposit, which got us started. My mom, who worked part-time, handled most of the inspections and ultimately chose the townhouse, despite it being a bit old. My dad, who worked two jobs, wasn’t involved in the decision-making.

My partner (34F) and I, who had been dating for just over a year and hadn’t been introduced to my parent yet, decided to renovate the house to make a good impression. We did extensive work: new floors, painting, new fixtures, etc. My partner even shopped with my mom to pick out everything. Despite our efforts, my mom constantly criticized the renovations, saying they didn’t meet her expectations, even though she chose all the designs.

After living there for a year, I decided to get engaged and move in with my partner. Managing two mortgages seemed daunting given my income of around $60,000 (AUD) at the time. I asked my parent if they could take over the mortgage to help. They refused, insisting I stick to our original agreement, despite knowing my partner’s income and assuming we could handle both mortgages. This caused significant stress and strained relations between my parent and my partner.

After failed attempts to renegotiate, I experienced mental health issues. My sister (31F) sided with my parent, adding to the tension. Eventually, unable to resolve the financial strain and emotional toll, I decided to sell the property. It wasn't for profit; we didn’t even check the property's value.

When I informed my mom about selling, she deferred to my dad for financial matters, but later requested reimbursement for air-conditioning and fans she had installed. My dad demanded $30,000 plus $30,000 in compensation, recording our conversation without my knowledge. After legal negotiations and taking out a loan, I repaid my dad $40,000 and sold the property, ending up with a $60,000 surplus.

Now, my relationship with my parent is strained. I wonder if I handled the situation poorly.

28,1dhl8bx,AITA for refusing to adjust kids custody for my kid’s father to travel to see his new girlfriend?,"My (40F) kids' father (45M) got a new girlfriend in Canada. 
We were together for 12y and separated last year. Rocky days. 

We have shared custody of the kids (8M and 10F) on a 2-2-3 days schedule when he works normal hours, but sometimes he has to work irregular 12h shifts as he is a security guard. When that happens, I have to have the kids and we then adapt the schedule so that he can have them more on his days off, keeping the 50-50% custody. 

The kids don't like to spend a lot of time without seeing one parent and we agreed that this plan was for the best, even though he was always more inclined to go for a 2-2-5-5 schedule.  

He now has a girlfriend who lives in Alberta, Canada (we are both from Oregon), so he's been travelling up there every other month, one week every time. She doesn't come. The kids stay with me when he's away, which already was a battle because he wanted his 78yo mother to take care of them while he was away so I wouldn't see them more than he would. 

Now he wants to change the custody so that when he leaves, the kids can stay with me BUT they have to stay with him for the same continuous amount of time when he gets back. 

I refuse. The kids have made it clear that they don't like spending long stretches of time without seeing me or their father. He chooses to leave, that's his thing, but I don't see why the kids would have to also be separated from me for a week just for the sake of the 50-50. 

I'm ok with having the kids with me when he's not there, they're my kids and I enjoy my time with them, so I don't mind if I have them more. I feel like he should choose the moments when he visits her that have the least impact on his time with the kids and that I shouldn't have to be even more flexible because he chose a partner from a different country.

On the other hand, I'm wondering if the kids will be badly impacted by my decision in the long run because it will in fact mean that they be with me 18 days more per year (until she comes live in the US). 

So, AITA for refusing to adjust the calendar?

Note: I have a better income and I give him a 4000$/yr stipend, so he cannot be afraid that I will ask for money if I spend more time with the kids.

I would talk to her almost everyday and when I was I would notice some of her storylines changed. 

   I noticed that pretty much no one in the family had any contact with his mom, she moved to Canada randomly. I met my husband online and we ended up meeting only because his mom lived in the same city as me. 

   My husband did tell me that their mom wasn’t in the picture much as a kids but after a while I ended up getting the full story and found out they were completely neglected and put in horrible situations as kids, she kidnapped them (his brother and she was pregnant with him) and took them away from their dad. My husband had never met his dad before and just knew he was Canadian. She had ran away to be with the other man who she would have another kid with.

  Fast forward to when we were dating I helped him find his bio dad and he was a great guy. His mom was constantly telling us how abusive and crazy he was, it didn’t seem right because she also told us multiple times how much she loves him and wants to be with him again. Since she ran away he went on to find a new wife and they have been together for over 25 years and are such amazing people. She gets really annoyed when we see them and don’t invite her, but the dad seems too traumatized to be in the same room.

    My husband had a lot of resentment towards his mom because she put them up for adoption after she had their half sister to be with another man in another state. Her parents took all 3 of them so they could stay together rather than be in separate families. Prior to that any sort of child support she was getting was never going to the kids, she only seemed to care about herself. 

   After she left that guy she moved to Canada again and tried to build a relationship with her now adult children. My husband hated her and didn’t talk to her for years until he finally did. He is really scared of abandonment and is very gullible when it comes to her. Almost everything she initially told me was a lie because she forgot her own lies and changed the story. We have a baby now and I refuse to see her more than once a month because I’m worried she’ll do the same thing or something else with her (she also has munchausen syndrome). 

   I want my husband to have a relationship with her if he wants and would never tell him not to, i just am worried for him since she pretends nothing ever happened and claims herself to be the person who raised them. I don’t want him to resent me for making our child not be close to her grandma but I really just don’t like her and don’t think she’s a good person.

I’m 22 years old and my birthday was a few months ago. My dad called me a couple days before and told me that we would have to wait and celebrate my birthday next weekend because they were leaving the day of to go on a camping trip. I just said a simple “OK” and continued my day.

I was on the phone with my aunt and when she asked about what I was doing for my birthday, I told her I would be hanging out my cousin. She asked, “Why not your mom and dad?” I explained to her what my dad told me and she said, sarcastically, “Oh that was very nice. They couldn’t have waited until after?” implying that it was a scummy thing for them to do. I never thought about it that way, but accepted it as true. Then I told two other people about it and they agreed that sucked. As we were talking, the subject of my birthday came up. That’s the only reason why I told them that; it’s not that I reached out solely for that reason.

During the weekend after my birthday, I was on the phone with my aunt again and I told her what those two had to say about what my parents did, to let her know she wasn’t the only one that felt that way. Her response? “Taylor, you’re 22 years old. Quit whining about it.” Now I’m confused. Was that wrong of my parents to do or not? I feel like my aunt’s attitude just took a complete 180 degree turn, like I’m being gaslighted in a way. What kind of two-faced bullshit is this? She said one thing, and now she’s saying something totally different that contradicts what she said before. But I don’t know… was I being whiny? I wasn’t trying to be.

I feel like my aunt’s attitude just took a complete 180 degree turn, like I’m being gaslighted in a way. What kind of two-faced bullshit is this? She said one thing, and now she’s saying something totally different that contradicts what she said before. But I don’t know… was I being whiny? I wasn’t trying to be.
