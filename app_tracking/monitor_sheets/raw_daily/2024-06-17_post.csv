0,1di4nhn,AITA for kicking out a friend for accusing me of being in love with my ex? ,"My ex and I dated for a few years before she came out as as a trans woman and that lead to us breaking up. We have remained friends but I am having some complicated emotions and it has led me to want to distance myself from her. 

We have a lot of common friends and I was hanging out with one of them in my home and we were getting ready to have a few other friends over. I talked about my ex and my friend straight up accused me of having feelings for her! It is absurd. 

She then listed out a lot of dumb high shit, Apparently I hate all the people she dated, I try to look good whenever I know she is coming over and I always make space for her next to me? Like this is so stupid, it can all be explained by me being a little jealous during the break-up and us being close friends. 

It really broke my heart she would think that I'm in love with my ex and I kicked her out. She was very confused when I kicked her out and she said I was overreacting to something very silly and that I needed to get over my bullshit. 

I feel like shit and like a massive idiot. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-17,"AITA for kicking out a friend for accusing me of being in love with my ex?

1,1di2i0z,AITA if I tear up a book and use it for my art project?,"I (23 ftm) am working on moving to a new place and i was going through my stuff deciding what to keep what to throw away etc. Well I found a religious work book given to me by the pastor of a church I used to be a part of. I didn't know what to do with it but I didn't want to throw it because I felt bad.

You see not long ago I joined a church (sorta) during a bad time in my life. My mom was in a mental hospital and I didn't how to take of myself (I was 21 at the time.) so a pastor and his wife, let call them M and E, who were involved with my brother, decided to help me. For some context I am a nonbinary trans man. I am not fully out, my brother and mother know and both are supportive tho my brother is better with gendering me correctly. I knew how churches could be bigoted but I really needed help so I didn't come out to them. Fast forward a bit and I decided to become a part of the church because I was lonely. I had no friends and had no way to leave the house on my own. They were very nice to me but pretending to be not trans was hurting me. I kept it down though because I didn't want to not have a community. I also foolishly believed I could endear myself to them and then come out and they would accept me. Fast forward and I decided to go on a trip to this church camp weekend thing. It went well at first but obviously having to pretend was still exhausting especially since now I couldn't be myself in private. Fast forward again towards near of the trip and I had one of worse conversations with E.

You see her and daughter had recently started working at the same place I work and there I was going by a different name that was also masculine. I thought nothing of it but she apparently she didn't. She basically told that being trans was a sin and that they qoute had 'live the way the Bible said.' I should have expected it but it still hurt. I decided right after I would leave the church and delete their numbers. I did but not before leaving a text expressing my gratitude for that their but that I needed to be myself. 

Now back to the work book. I have this work book because before leaving I became part of a group lead by M where we filled it out to bring us closer to god or something like that. I still have it because I don't want to talk to them again. I found it again while going through my stuff and it brought up bad memories. I didn't want to throw it away because I have an on going papier-mâché project I could use it for. Then I felt bad because I know these books cost money but I would literally rather eat my own foot then talk to them again.

2,1dhzf2e,AITA for not following the dresscode that wasn't directed at my 'gender',"I'm a 15 year old trans boy that goes to a super religious Catholic school run by nuns. They have very strict dresscodes (eg: girls being required to have their hair tied in braids and not being allowed to wear pants that show their ankles, boys being required to have short hair) The teachers weren't very happy about me cutting my hair short but there's nothing in the dresscode they couldhold against me. The front part of my hair is starting to get abitl long and i decided to leave it that way because it looked silly and cute to me, but last week I got stopped in a hallway by a nun who told me that if I was gonna dress and behave like a boy, I better start following their dresscode too. I am not out of the closet yet and am practically a still a girl to the outside eye, I still wear the girls' uniform and go by she/her pronouns, so I think it's a bit unfair to force me to follow the dresscode when Im still treated as a girl. My parents who usually stand up for me in situations like this, sided with the school, so did my friends. that left me wondering if i was just being a stubborn asshole.

3,1dhnbpe,AITA for not meeting my friends,"I (29F) have 2 friends (also 29F) who have rescheduled meeting up for 2 weeks now. Usually, I am understanding for reasons why, but the first reason was cause we hadn't collectively really thought of what to do (e.g., go out to eat, shop, have a picnic). For me, a catch-up or going out doesn't really require an intensive plan unless you're trying to go somewhere fancy or currently trendy on tiktok. So the next weekend rolls by, and not one of my friends thinks of a plan or to even suggest anything. I had suggested multiple things even in the first week, but the weather was kinda shitty so we decided to just reschedule. Plus, no one seemed committed to any of the options I mentioned. Day of our meet-up, and they weren't even awake before NOON. They are both 29 y.o, its a Sunday and the sun is also out. Which means it's just perfect to go out and meet each other. To make matters worse, I had suggested a place, and they both drive, always preaching to me it makes it easier for them, but they can not drive their little butt 30-40min out to the place you mention. I would have been easily travelling double that as a public transport girly to get to some locations simply cause I want to go and I like the person. It makes it so annoying that they won't do the same. All I'm saying is, don't own a car if you're so lazy to drive it, or are they just so selfish that they don't want to see friends the moment it gets a little inconvenient? Who owns a car to literally only want to drive out MAX a 15-20min radius from where they live? Are they scared they'll get lost or something? Like what the heck? If it's all too much for them, then why do I even put in effort to this friendship when they won't? They also joined forces in the group chat, saying they can't take public transport either cause they hate it and its a bother too, and that's why they drive everywhere but won't DRIVE? LIKE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. It just seems like they have never and won't explore further than the road they live on. They clearly don't care about meeting if they only want to stay local and not travel out to different locations. I am so annoyed at these types of people who won't put in an effort to see you, no matter how short notice it is. I can leave my house past noon, why can't you?

Shortly after, the same friends suggest a short dog walk around where they live, cause they both own a dog, but thing is, you don't even own a dog. So I'm just meant to accompany you guys on a walk like some extra? They have been very inconsiderate. Then they say ""Oh but you could still walk with us?"", well what if I don't want to? Because I can't join into the day without entertaining YOUR dogs. You see where this is going? it's only been about YOU.

4,1dhnawg,AITA for leaving my friends birthday party,"My (23m) bf and I (22f) got invited to our close friend (f) 21st birthday party. The plan was changed 4 times and we were sent 4 different itinerary’s for 4 different places. 

We inquired more about this event, who’s going how much, when etc and found out it would be $360 for overnight accommodations per person, $720 total between my bf and I. We get the final plan, it is over an hour away in an expensive costal town in another state. Decided ~if~ it happened we would go for one afternoon/evening and go home after to avoid paying for overnight accommodations, our other friend who is also invited decides he will join us. 

We get the guest list and it is no one we know but all of her older sisters friends, bf, bfs roommates are invited. 

The plan for when we arrived was to meet for dinner and then go to a few bars after. However when we got there and texted her we were coming to meet up she informed the three of us the actually moved their reservation up and dinner was now over and they have moved to a bar. Fine. We head to the bar wait in line get to the front, there is a $45 cover and we don’t have enough cash. Fine. We need to find an atm and something to eat since dinner was now over. 

We grab a quick bite to eat and some cash and head back. The line at this point to get into the bar is over 2 hours. We text our friend asking if we can meet her at the next bar on the list. She tells us she likes the vibes at this bar and doesn’t plan on leaving for another 2 hours or so. We explain to her by the time we wait in line she will be leaving so we will just go now to the next bar and meet her after.

At this point she tells us to go home she doesn’t care anymore we should leave. So we walk to the car. When we get in the car she calls our friend again and goes ballistic that she’s crying we’re being difficult and confusing.

5,1dhn83w,AITA airing out my grievances about my roommates right before I move out?,"Since August last year, I (22F) have been living in a house with 4 other girls: Fran (24), Kate (21), Elle (20), and Becky (26). I would say that I'm closest with Fran, and Becky is quite close with Kate. Fran and I are both moving out in a few weeks. At Thanksgiving, Becky got together with Nina (27F). Nina had been living with her boyfriend and now needed somewhere to stay. Becky said she was moving in with her parents, but a few days later, Nina's boxes were coming into the house for ""storage"" and she was at the house 4-5 nights/week.

A few months later, Nina was a regular presence at the house and had her own keys. Fran and I both felt put out about this, and Fran spoke to Becky privately via text about it at Christmas. I was mentioned in these texts and had a conversation with Becky after she said that she was feeling put out by me letting Fran speak for me. These conversations didn't amount to much. 

Kate has recently been bringing over her boyfriend, sister, and her parents' dog. Before we moved in together, we discussed communication regarding overnight guests. There is even a whiteboard in the kitchen for them to be written down. Becky and Kate used to use it.

I'm an avoidant person, but felt like I owed it to myself to speak up even 6 months late. I sent a message in the group chat and tried to keep it light. I made it clear that I wasn't expecting any changes in behavior - I just wanted to get things off my chest. I expressed my discomfort with keys being given out. Fran and Elle responded favorably. Becky and Kate did not. For context, the previous day I had asked for communication regarding overnight guests and new pets, so the vibe was already off. 

Becky and Kate said that this conversation should've been had in person - which I can agree with to a point - but we've said that we would have house meetings before, and they never happened. I explained that I thought texting would lessen everyone's stress and give people time to think over their responses.

The sentiment from Kate was basically ""I don't care how you feel, I'm not changing my behavior."" She said that I wanted to monitor who comes into the house and that she wouldn’t report to me. I got the same response from Becky (albeit less aggressively phrased) in addition to being blamed for causing the issue by not speaking up sooner. Things devolved in the group chat, to the point where Elle felt the need to delete the chat entirely. When I said that I thought it was commonly understood that keys shouldn't be given out to people not on the lease, Becky said that wasn't a valid assumption and that I needed to explicitly state that it made me uncomfortable.

In the end, the landlord got involved and shared lease conditions that backed my and Fran's position. It also came to light that Becky had asked the landlord if she could add Nina to the lease now - without talking to me or Fran about it.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA airing out my grievances about my roommates right before I move out?

6,1dhn6dg,AITA for refusing to repay my dad?,"I'm a university student studying Engineering. I live with my parents, and I don't have a job on account of me being a full-time student. I've needed a new laptop for a while, but the fact that I'm now working with Solidworks (3D modeling software) meant that my dad made a deal with me: He'd pay for a laptop and I'd pay him back when I got a job during the summer. I agreed, a laptop was purchased (cost of \~$2,000), and I sent him $500 (half of my savings at the time) to prove that I fully intended to pay him back. He made it clear that, until I paid him back, the laptop was essentially on-loan from him.

Fast forward to a few months ago. The laptop had always run on the hotter side, but now it was thermal throttling when I tried to do anything with it. I did some troubleshooting, consulted the internet, and came to the conclusion that the thermal paste was either poorly applied or had dried up. For those who don't know, if a laptop can't cool itself down, it stops working as hard so it doesn't overheat and fry itself from the inside. This is called thermal throttling, and thermal paste is really important to prevent it. If it's left unchecked, the laptop would continue to overheat, get slower, and eventually fail to start up.

I explained this to my dad and said that I could open up the laptop and re-apply the thermal paste myself. I previously worked at a PC repair shop, so I knew this would take me about an hour and cost maybe $10 (the cost of the new thermal paste). He refused. I offered to take it to a repair shop and they can re-apply the thermal paste. I also offered to either pay for the repair myself or he can add it to my tab (that I still intended to repay). He refused saying that he doesn't want to open up the laptop and risk damaging it until I had fully paid it off. I tried to explain how bad this could get and how easily I could fix it, but he was set in his decision.

Fast forward to yesterday morning. I tried starting up the laptop, and it was unresponsive. I tried to troubleshoot the issue, but it was totally bricked. I informed my dad about this and explained that I would no longer be paying him for the remainder of the laptop. He demanded to know why I would do that, and I explained that he knew there was an issue with the laptop that could potentially cause serious damage, and not only did he ignore the issue, he shot down all of my recommendations and offers to fix it. As far as I'm concerned, he loaned me a laptop, then let it overheat and die. He called me a snake and said that I had 24 hours to repay him my remaining debt (\~$1,500) or he'd kick me out. We exchanged some harsh words, and he stormed out of the house.

My mom assured me that I won't be kicked out, but that I really should hold up my end of the deal and pay him back, albeit with more than a day to do so. I think that I'm in the right, but I can't help but feel like I just cheated my dad out of $1,500. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for refusing to repay my dad?

For those who don't know, if a laptop can't cool itself down, it stops working as hard so it doesn't overheat and fry itself from the inside. This is called thermal throttling, and thermal paste is really important to prevent it. If it's left unchecked, the laptop would continue to overheat, get slower, and eventually fail to start up.

I explained this to my dad and said that I could open up the laptop and re-apply the thermal paste myself. I previously worked at a PC repair shop, so I knew this would take me about an hour and cost maybe $10 (the cost of the new thermal paste). He refused. I offered to take it to a repair shop and they can re-apply the thermal paste. I also offered to either pay for the repair myself or he can add it to my tab (that I still intended to repay). He refused saying that he doesn't want to open up the laptop and risk damaging it until I had fully paid it off. I tried to explain how bad this could get and how easily I could fix it, but he was set in his decision.

Fast forward to yesterday morning. I tried starting up the laptop, and it was unresponsive. I tried to troubleshoot the issue, but it was totally bricked. I informed my dad about this and explained that I would no longer be paying him for the remainder of the laptop. He demanded to know why I would do that, and I explained that he knew there was an issue with the laptop that could potentially cause serious damage, and not only did he ignore the issue, he shot down all of my recommendations and offers to fix it. As far as I'm concerned, he loaned me a laptop, then let it overheat and die. He called me a snake and said that I had 24 hours to repay him my remaining debt (\~$1,500) or he'd kick me out. We exchanged some harsh words, and he stormed out of the house.

My mom assured me that I won't be kicked out, but that I really should hold up my end of the deal and pay him back, albeit with more than a day to do so. I think that I'm in the right, but I can't help but feel like I just cheated my dad out of $1,500. AITA?",0.0,1.0421213,1,0
7,1dhmp1i,AITAH For Not Allowing my Wife to Drink?,"I know the title sounds like I am starring in a sitcom in the ‘50s but it isn’t like that I promise. 

For context; before I met my wife she was a self proclaimed alcoholic and drug addict who was addicted to some pretty bad drugs. A couple months before we met she decided to quit using drugs and went to NA meetings to help her with her sobriety. After her first meeting she went to a bar and got drunk. After some time she also decided to quit alcohol. Since then the only drugs she uses are nicotine and delta 8. She has been sober for years at this point.

Context for me; I have always been against alcohol because I don’t like the way it tastes or the way it makes me feel. Also I think it makes others make bad decisions and I don’t like being in a state of mind where I can make bad decisions. I am not against drugs and used to use marijuana and psychedelics commonly. At the point of meeting my wife up to now I have only used nicotine. I met my wife on a dating app where one of the reasons I wanted to meet her was because she stated that she was sober. I thought it would be nice to be in a relationship where I didn’t have to DD for the other person or take care of them when they are drunk or high like I have had to do in past relationships. 

Now for the asshole of me. We had a baby about a year ago and it was really hard on her. She had bad post partum depression after a high risk and not great pregnancy. We have a beautiful baby boy who we both love and her depression is mostly gone. Sometimes he can still be a huge handful and some doctors have told us that we need to watch for autism in him. Recently my wife has been talking about how nice it would be to have a glass of wine at the end of the day. That’s fair considering how hard she has it being a stay at home mom but I had assumed she was just venting and reminiscing. 

That is, until she asked me if I would be okay if she did drink wine at the end of the day on hard days. I told her that I wouldn’t be comfortable with that considering her past addiction issues and I explained to her how I feel about alcohol. She acquiesced but was obviously unhappy about my reaction. 

I feel like an asshole because it is her body and she should be able to do what she wants with it. I am mostly just scared she will fall into old habits but I am also definitely coming at it with a selfish perspective.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITAH For Not Allowing my Wife to Drink?

now, he's just working on cosmetic stuff,  specifically painting it himself. he bought spray cans and then asked me if i would help him shake them up. at first i said no, because i didn't feel like it. he explained that it wouldn't take that much time or effort on my part, so i  agreed.

as the day to paint gets closer, he's asked me if i'll also stand outside with a sheet of cardboard while he paints so that paint doesn't get on the neighbor's car. i said no because that would be both tiring and boring for me, and there are other ways i'd rather spend my weekend.

this sparked a fight between us, with him insisting that i'm being an asshole for not wanting to help him and me insisting that it's unfair of him to be angry with me for not wanting to spend my free time on his hobby. (i do some gig work a few hours a day on weekdays, and am responsible for all of the cooking, cleaning, etc.)

11,1dhmeex,AITA for Refusing to Reveal the Identity of an Anonymous Survey Respondent?,"TL;DR: I allowed a club member to submit a survey anonymously to encourage honest feedback. When the board reviewed the responses, one critical anonymous survey upset ""Dee,"" who demanded to know the respondent's identity. I refused, believing in the importance of anonymity for honest feedback. Dee insists anonymity wasn’t guaranteed and accuses me of lacking integrity. AITA for not revealing the respondent?

Hi

I recently sent out surveys to the members of a small group I'm part of to gather feedback on how the year went. One member approached me, the club president, and asked if they could submit their survey anonymously. Believing that anonymity encourages honest feedback without fear of reprisal, I allowed it.

When the board reviewed the survey responses, one stood out. It was passionate and expressed frustration with certain activities, stating that they felt uncomfortable with how things were being run. Despite the strong feelings, the feedback contained no threats or personal attacks.

However, the person responsible for organizing those activities, let’s call her Dee, got upset. Instead of addressing the concerns raised, she immediately demanded to know who submitted the survey. Since this was the only anonymous submission, I knew who it was. But I believe people should be able to give feedback without fear of reprisal, and Dee’s reaction only reinforced this belief. I refused to reveal the name.

This refusal made Dee even more upset. She emailed me the next morning, accusing me of lacking integrity and insisting that I tell her who submitted the survey. I stood my ground, explaining that anonymity in surveys is crucial for honest feedback and that revealing the respondent’s identity would violate my ethics and self-respect.

Dee argued that, as someone who served with me on the board for three years, she deserved my respect and should always know who submits feedback. She believes those administering surveys need to know the respondents’ names to address issues directly. Additionally, she recalled being asked for input on the survey's content and stated, ""Therefore, I believe that this is not a personal endeavor of any one member of the board. At no point was anonymity guaranteed to anyone filling out the survey, and, by that, I mean remaining anonymous to those who had a hand in developing the survey. Of course, the views should not be shared beyond the boundaries of the board. Also, this is not a matter of your personal ethics. Although developed principally by you, this has been a board process and, if you disagree, then you were out of line to involve members of the board in refining it.""

It's worth noting that the survey had a spot for names, which I felt discouraged members from submitting honest feedback or expressing their true concerns. My request was to set the questions asked on the survey and gather information to help the club learn from the past year.

I don't feel that I stepped out of line. Their feedback helped develop the questions needed for the survey. And while no guarantee of anonymity was on the survey, there was no mention that it wasn't.

I own my apartment and I have one unit above mine, a few years ago the wax seal of their toilet broke and needless to say I suffered a fair amount of water damage and my ceiling had to be repaired pretty extensively in my bathroom.

He constantly infantilises me. Anytime I try to do something he has to go on this rant about how to do the simple thing. I'll try to wipe the table and he makes sure I know that I need to use cleaner, that sort of thing. Whenever my mother tells me something he repeats it word for word, and when I act annoyed by this and ask him to stop, he claims that I'm taking away his right to an opinion and his voice. He also does petty things, he'll buy me food and when I don't eat it ""quick enough"" he'll eat it, but to prove a point, he will leave one bite of the thing in the box. Anytime I try to tell him I'm annoyed he says something like ""you ate my little Caesars! We are even"" when I did not know the Little Caesars was his, and I did not leave only one bite, I left a sustainable amount in the box.

I'm really fed up and I want to call him out on it, but I don't want to seem like an asshole, and I don't want to be petty over things that aren't a big deal. So WIBTA",,0.0201838,0,0
15,1dhm2wk,WIBTA If I asked my roommates for money to cover groceries?,"WIBTA if I asked my roommates for money to cover groceries?

I am a 45yo slightly physically disabled woman currently living with some friends (my best friend at the time and his unemployed nephew) that came to my aid when I needed a place to go after being evicted from my trailer. That was a rough month. I lost my job, car and home within 3 weeks of each other. within a month or two of moving in with them, I found a job working at Home Depot and have been there ever since. It's not GREAT pay but I was working on saving up to move into an apartment or something.

Then about 6 months ago, I started noticing the groceries i was buying for myself were going missing. I have memory issues, so I thought maybe I was eating them and forgetting? Then I started noticing that the boxes and cans were opened different ways than to what I usually do so that confirmed it wasn't me. So, I confronted my roommate and asked him if he'd been the one getting into the stuff and if so, that's fine, I would just like some notice and maybe a little cash to cover what they ate. nothing. 

Now, normally I wouldn't say anything, but I figured out that it was his nephew taking the food and I mean...he blew through a 10lb bag of rice in 2 weeks. And it's not like he would save any of it. there was rice in the bottom of the pan he made it in that he could've put in the fridge for leftovers, but he let it go to waste. It angers me because he's not a child, he's a 24-year-old grown ass man who should know better.

  
 BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE:

To put things in perspective, about 3 months ago, I lost my Medicaid because according to them, I was making too much money working at HD and I'm not paying bills (except my phone) because that was the agreement so I could try to save up. I have two types of insulin i'm on, plus thyroid and anti-psychotic/depressant meds that are NOT cheap. i've spent more on meds and food in the last 3 months than i have in the last year so whatever I had saved up I had to spend on that.

I started putting my non-perishables in a milk crate under my bed to keep him from taking it but that didn't stop him. He broke into my room, went under my bed, found the crate and took half of my food and ate it himself. So now I keep what food I can in my car, which is a whole other issue especially with the current weather getting warmer. Also, for context, the car I currently have is a 1999 Toyota Camry with 180k miles on it, the trunk is being held together by electrical tape, it needs extensive exhaust system work done on it, and the rear bumper is missing from an accident that had happened before the car came into my possession.

20,1dhlweb,AITAH for making a comment about my gf lipstick color?,"Hi reddit,

I love my gf to death and I think the world of her.

we are on vacation in Mexico to celebrate her birthday and we’ve been taking pictures left and right of her.  

One night we find a restaurant to sit at and eat, and we started going through the pictures we’ve taken.

 She gets to one of them and says oh I really like that one, what do you think about my lipstick color?

Normally my opinion is whatever makes you happy sweetie, but this time for some odd reason i just wanted to answer the question.

I say something along the lines of, it’s a dark red lipstick and i think it blends in with your skin…meaning no contrast.

She completely shuts down the rest of the dinner, and i’m trying to figure out why.

when we step out of the restaurant she explodes, accusing me of being colorist and not liking her skin color. she says it really hurt her feelings. 

I understand it hurt her feelings, but the way she just started accusing me of almost being racist got me instantly on the defensive. Because I didn’t say anything about her skin color but more so why does my girlfriend think I’m this nasty person.  I DO NOT hate my gf skin color, she’s beautiful. I would not be in Mexico with her if i didn’t like her skin.

Anyways, we leave the restaurant and walk 25 minutes back to our Airbnb and she does not say a word to me though entire time. When we get home, we start getting ready for bed and I noticed my girlfriend is locked in on her phone.

I ask her what’s up? What are you doing? To which she responds in my shock that her two male friends think that her skin is perfect. 

At this point, I’m pissed because I didn’t say anything about her skin color, but more so i’m pissed at fact that she already told two people, I don’t really like these guys and haven’t met them, about the situation and put words in my mouth.

We get into an argument because i told her I do not like when WE don’t fix the problem, and she goes/uses other men to cope. she ends up locking me out of the room.

I feel real bad that I offended my girlfriend’s feelings and immediately apologized and explained myself, but she went to other guys to talk about our problems….and she’s painting me as the asshole to others…

TLDR: I told my girlfriend I don’t like her lipstick color, she took it as I don’t like her skin color, and then proceeded to push me away when I was trying to resolve.

23,1dhllp3,AITA for not reaching out? ,"I (22f) had been friends with Adam (22m) for 3 years. We met in college during our freshman year (I helped him with something on campus), and he was introduced to a friend group I was also in. This includes Beth (27f) and Carrie (24f).

Adam was my dorm roommate for 2 years. Because of how long we had been living with each other, we had made plans to become roommates in our city after I graduated. He mentioned me paying for majority rent since he would be a student still, and I would be working full time. I had an extremely busy schedule during school, I worked two part-time jobs, had a full class load, and wanted to improve my relationships with my peers in my classes (wanted to make more friends!). I rarely went back to my dorm, and he only made it clear that my schedule upset him months into this ordeal. 

In October, my brother was asking to live with me for a few days a week in my city after I graduate. He was getting a job opportunity somewhere. He couldn't afford another place on his own, and his wife didn't want to move. I took a few days to think about it before speaking with Adam. I told him all I knew at the time. My brother was asking for my help and I intended to help him. Family comes first, and I've always been clear about it with all my friends (especially since my oldest brother had passed). Adam didn't take it very well. After some silence. he only told me he was mad at me. I said ‘I’m sorry’, and he left. 

For a week afterwards, he didn't speak to me, and I had assumed he didn't want to speak to me to sort his own thoughts. He also didn't speak to Carrie or Beth in our server (all four of us would be active daily). After a week, I initiated a conversation. Three main points were made during this talk, 1 I shouldn’t ‘let him go silent, because he could go the rest of his life without speaking to us’. 2 He isn’t obligated to reach out to anyone. 3 I am a bad friend. I’m not fantastic at articulating my thoughts, so I didn’t have much to say. I was hurt, and asked to continue the conversation a different day before I said something I regret. We didn't speak again until after Christmas break.

Before this point, I spoke with Carrie and Beth about it all. I didn’t shy away from the fact that I didn’t reach out to him. They pointed out that, whenever they reach out, they get snapped at by him. That was the case for all 2 years we've known him. 

After Christmas (all three of us got him gifts), I tried to speak to him again. During this conversation, he insulted Beth, and said he only reached out to her when she was hospitalized because she had been starting conversations with him first. He said that I ‘should have recognized he was in a bad mood before I said anything about my brother’. His treatment of our friends made me upset, to the point that I decided that my graduating, senior year thesis and jobs were more important than trying to resolve this. We haven’t spoken since.

My brother was asking for my help and I intended to help him. Family comes first, and I've always been clear about it with all my friends (especially since my oldest brother had passed). Adam didn't take it very well. After some silence. he only told me he was mad at me. I said ‘I’m sorry’, and he left. 

For a week afterwards, he didn't speak to me, and I had assumed he didn't want to speak to me to sort his own thoughts. He also didn't speak to Carrie or Beth in our server (all four of us would be active daily). After a week, I initiated a conversation. Three main points were made during this talk, 1 I shouldn’t ‘let him go silent, because he could go the rest of his life without speaking to us’. 2 He isn’t obligated to reach out to anyone. 3 I am a bad friend. I’m not fantastic at articulating my thoughts, so I didn’t have much to say. I was hurt, and asked to continue the conversation a different day before I said something I regret. We didn't speak again until after Christmas break.

Before this point, I spoke with Carrie and Beth about it all. I didn’t shy away from the fact that I didn’t reach out to him. They pointed out that, whenever they reach out, they get snapped at by him. That was the case for all 2 years we've known him. 

After Christmas (all three of us got him gifts), I tried to speak to him again. During this conversation, he insulted Beth, and said he only reached out to her when she was hospitalized because she had been starting conversations with him first. He said that I ‘should have recognized he was in a bad mood before I said anything about my brother’. His treatment of our friends made me upset, to the point that I decided that my graduating, senior year thesis and jobs were more important than trying to resolve this. We haven’t spoken since.

24,1dhlkj8,AITA for accusing my cousin's inclusivity of being performative and fake?,"Before I start I just want to inform that English is not my first language so I apologize in advance if I say anything that's incoherent 
I (16F) have a cousin (19M) who I'll call Jason. Jason is a very progressive person,  which has never been a problem since our family is not conservative, but there's a thing about Jason that I find extremely annoying. 

Jason defends the rights of women, queer people, people of color and people with disabilities, which, again, awesome stuff, I support it, but at the same time he says people shouldn't be excluded from society because of their disabilities he's constantly excluding and mistreating my little brother (8M) who has a learning disability, he actively refuses to participate in any family event if he knows my brother will be there and when he can't avoid my brother in a way he gets extremely moody and rude to everyone. 
And it's not like my brother is a difficult child to deal with, I know I can sound biased because I'm his sister but he's genuinely just a quiet boy who keeps to himself and rarely interacts with people outside of the family, the only time he has tantrums is when he's teased which rarely ever happens, so I don't see why Jason despises him so much. 

He even straight up missed his mom's birthday because my brother was in the party too, after that I finally had enough and the next day i confronted him about his behavior but he just completely denied ever excluding my brother and even said him and I were always hanging out when we were younger and because I'm autistic that means he doesn't mistreat disabled people.

I told him his argument didn't make any sense and that all his inclusivity discourse he's always talking about is performative and not what he really thinks deep inside, because how can he rant nonstop about how we should include disabled people in society if he's not willing to even exist in the same place as a disabled kid, he obviously didn't appreciate it and refused to talk to me after that.

25,1dhlhr0,AITA for Selling the House and Creating Tension with My Parent?,"Hi everyone,

It’s been almost two years since I (30M) last spoke to my parent. Here's the backstory:

About three years ago, my parent and I decided to buy a small townhouse together. The agreement was that I would pay the mortgage, and they would cover other expenses like rates, body corporate fees, electricity, and food. My dad gifted me $30,000 (AUD) for the deposit, which got us started. My mom, who worked part-time, handled most of the inspections and ultimately chose the townhouse, despite it being a bit old. My dad, who worked two jobs, wasn’t involved in the decision-making.

My partner (34F) and I, who had been dating for just over a year and hadn’t been introduced to my parent yet, decided to renovate the house to make a good impression. We did extensive work: new floors, painting, new fixtures, etc. My partner even shopped with my mom to pick out everything. Despite our efforts, my mom constantly criticized the renovations, saying they didn’t meet her expectations, even though she chose all the designs.

After living there for a year, I decided to get engaged and move in with my partner. Managing two mortgages seemed daunting given my income of around $60,000 (AUD) at the time. I asked my parent if they could take over the mortgage to help. They refused, insisting I stick to our original agreement, despite knowing my partner’s income and assuming we could handle both mortgages. This caused significant stress and strained relations between my parent and my partner.

After failed attempts to renegotiate, I experienced mental health issues. My sister (31F) sided with my parent, adding to the tension. Eventually, unable to resolve the financial strain and emotional toll, I decided to sell the property. It wasn't for profit; we didn’t even check the property's value.

When I informed my mom about selling, she deferred to my dad for financial matters, but later requested reimbursement for air-conditioning and fans she had installed. My dad demanded $30,000 plus $30,000 in compensation, recording our conversation without my knowledge. After legal negotiations and taking out a loan, I repaid my dad $40,000 and sold the property, ending up with a $60,000 surplus.

Now, my relationship with my parent is strained. I wonder if I handled the situation poorly.

28,1dhl8bx,AITA for refusing to adjust kids custody for my kid’s father to travel to see his new girlfriend?,"My (40F) kids' father (45M) got a new girlfriend in Canada. 
We were together for 12y and separated last year. Rocky days. 

We have shared custody of the kids (8M and 10F) on a 2-2-3 days schedule when he works normal hours, but sometimes he has to work irregular 12h shifts as he is a security guard. When that happens, I have to have the kids and we then adapt the schedule so that he can have them more on his days off, keeping the 50-50% custody. 

The kids don't like to spend a lot of time without seeing one parent and we agreed that this plan was for the best, even though he was always more inclined to go for a 2-2-5-5 schedule.  

He now has a girlfriend who lives in Alberta, Canada (we are both from Oregon), so he's been travelling up there every other month, one week every time. She doesn't come. The kids stay with me when he's away, which already was a battle because he wanted his 78yo mother to take care of them while he was away so I wouldn't see them more than he would. 

Now he wants to change the custody so that when he leaves, the kids can stay with me BUT they have to stay with him for the same continuous amount of time when he gets back. 

I refuse. The kids have made it clear that they don't like spending long stretches of time without seeing me or their father. He chooses to leave, that's his thing, but I don't see why the kids would have to also be separated from me for a week just for the sake of the 50-50. 

I'm ok with having the kids with me when he's not there, they're my kids and I enjoy my time with them, so I don't mind if I have them more. I feel like he should choose the moments when he visits her that have the least impact on his time with the kids and that I shouldn't have to be even more flexible because he chose a partner from a different country.

On the other hand, I'm wondering if the kids will be badly impacted by my decision in the long run because it will in fact mean that they be with me 18 days more per year (until she comes live in the US). 

So, AITA for refusing to adjust the calendar?

Note: I have a better income and I give him a 4000$/yr stipend, so he cannot be afraid that I will ask for money if I spend more time with the kids.

I would talk to her almost everyday and when I was I would notice some of her storylines changed. 

   I noticed that pretty much no one in the family had any contact with his mom, she moved to Canada randomly. I met my husband online and we ended up meeting only because his mom lived in the same city as me. 

   My husband did tell me that their mom wasn’t in the picture much as a kids but after a while I ended up getting the full story and found out they were completely neglected and put in horrible situations as kids, she kidnapped them (his brother and she was pregnant with him) and took them away from their dad. My husband had never met his dad before and just knew he was Canadian. She had ran away to be with the other man who she would have another kid with.

  Fast forward to when we were dating I helped him find his bio dad and he was a great guy. His mom was constantly telling us how abusive and crazy he was, it didn’t seem right because she also told us multiple times how much she loves him and wants to be with him again. Since she ran away he went on to find a new wife and they have been together for over 25 years and are such amazing people. She gets really annoyed when we see them and don’t invite her, but the dad seems too traumatized to be in the same room.

    My husband had a lot of resentment towards his mom because she put them up for adoption after she had their half sister to be with another man in another state. Her parents took all 3 of them so they could stay together rather than be in separate families. Prior to that any sort of child support she was getting was never going to the kids, she only seemed to care about herself. 

   After she left that guy she moved to Canada again and tried to build a relationship with her now adult children. My husband hated her and didn’t talk to her for years until he finally did. He is really scared of abandonment and is very gullible when it comes to her. Almost everything she initially told me was a lie because she forgot her own lies and changed the story. We have a baby now and I refuse to see her more than once a month because I’m worried she’ll do the same thing or something else with her (she also has munchausen syndrome). 

   I want my husband to have a relationship with her if he wants and would never tell him not to, i just am worried for him since she pretends nothing ever happened and claims herself to be the person who raised them. I don’t want him to resent me for making our child not be close to her grandma but I really just don’t like her and don’t think she’s a good person.

I’m 22 years old and my birthday was a few months ago. My dad called me a couple days before and told me that we would have to wait and celebrate my birthday next weekend because they were leaving the day of to go on a camping trip. I just said a simple “OK” and continued my day.

I was on the phone with my aunt and when she asked about what I was doing for my birthday, I told her I would be hanging out my cousin. She asked, “Why not your mom and dad?” I explained to her what my dad told me and she said, sarcastically, “Oh that was very nice. They couldn’t have waited until after?” implying that it was a scummy thing for them to do. I never thought about it that way, but accepted it as true. Then I told two other people about it and they agreed that sucked. As we were talking, the subject of my birthday came up. That’s the only reason why I told them that; it’s not that I reached out solely for that reason.

During the weekend after my birthday, I was on the phone with my aunt again and I told her what those two had to say about what my parents did, to let her know she wasn’t the only one that felt that way. Her response? “Taylor, you’re 22 years old. Quit whining about it.” Now I’m confused. Was that wrong of my parents to do or not? I feel like my aunt’s attitude just took a complete 180 degree turn, like I’m being gaslighted in a way. What kind of two-faced bullshit is this? She said one thing, and now she’s saying something totally different that contradicts what she said before. But I don’t know… was I being whiny? I wasn’t trying to be.

I feel like my aunt’s attitude just took a complete 180 degree turn, like I’m being gaslighted in a way. What kind of two-faced bullshit is this? She said one thing, and now she’s saying something totally different that contradicts what she said before. But I don’t know… was I being whiny? I wasn’t trying to be.

31,1dicqoc,AITA for raising my voice and getting “mad” at my husband for something that happened months ago?,"My husband is in recovery for substance abuse . It’s been a rough few years between the pandemic and dealing with his struggles. He finally started working on recovery in December of last year after over two years of him drinking, abusing some OTC and other things you can legally purchase, and for a while he was abusing his adderall and stealing mine. 

He had a relapse in April for about three weeks that I found out about after the fact. We had all been sick and he was sleeping on the couch because of his snoring while sick and apparently he was staying up drinking after I went to bed. 

I found out and we worked through it and he got back on the right track. Fast forward to today when I’ve been having a really hard day and honestly don’t know why exactly. I’m almost definitely autistic (our daughter has been diagnosed and we are exactly alike but I haven’t), so sometimes I do have big reactions and feelings. I think the transition from school to summer vacation is just taking a toll on me and I feel burnt out and overwhelmed. So I went for a drive to have some alone time. When I got home I went to make some food and a drink and noticed my homemade vanilla extract looked weird. 

I asked my husband if it looked weird and he confessed he had drank some of it during his relapse and then added water so I wouldn’t know. I immediately started crying. I know that sounds silly but it takes a year to fully finish vanilla extract and that was the only jar I had and he added water to cover up his behavior so it will most likely spoil now due to not having a high enough alcohol content, not that I know exactly what it is because he is the one who added the water, not me. 

I got upset and told him so and he basically said I couldn’t be mad because it happened months ago. I feel that since I just found out today it doesn’t really matter when it happened I’m allowed to feel hurt and upset. I didn’t get super upset until he tried to deflect and act like it shouldn’t be a big deal to me. Had he just owned his shit and apologized I would have moved on. I’d still be hurt but I wouldn’t have gotten “mad”.

He left to go to a meeting, but still thinks I’m in the wrong for “getting mad at him” about something that happened so long ago. So, AITA? 

UPDATE: he came home from the meeting and gave a proper apology. He acknowledged he was being a jerk and I had every right to be upset. We talked about him trying to tell me the full story of his mishaps so I’m not caught off guard months later.

I (30f) used to work with a man (35m). On a professional level, we worked fine together but definitely clashed several times regarding how he treated and talked to several people (myself included) He's made a lot of sexist comments that made me try to keep my distance from him. He finally moved on to another job a year ago. 

It's important to note that he's not from the US, but his wife is. They have been married for over 8 years and have 2 children together. I've met her and she's a very nice person. I'm connected to them both through social media. I only really stayed connected with him in the event our jobs are looking for extra help. We refer people to each other every summer.

Last week, he reached out to me to let me know his job is looking for some summer help and if I had any summer employees that were looking for 2nd jobs to send them his way. I told him I would. 

He then went on to say ""If you know any women from (his country of orgin) who wants to stay in the US, give them my number. I'm looking for a wife!""

I was obviously confused and asked him about his current marriage. He said that she ""No longer wants to be his wife, and he needs someone to raise his kids. But keep it to yourself and dont tell anyone I said this.""

This is a huge red flag for me. Both of them are still connected to each other on social media but I know what doesn't necessarily mean they aren't separated. They don't post much on their private life so It wouldn't surprise me if they are separated and haven't said anything to anyone. 

My gut is telling me to reach out to his wife about what he said, but idk if that's the right thing to do. If it was me, I would want to know but that's my view point. Should I tell her or stay out of it? 

WIBTA if I tell her about his messages? 

Edit: Making this because I've seen a couple comments about this topic. 
This guy and I aren't in any kind of business together, or even work for the same company. He works at a completely separate business. He just reaches out if he needs extra help at his job, and I let my summer team know in case they want another job to make more money. Me telling his wife won't affect me on any professional level, as this is a personal thing and not buisness oriented.

33,1dicnzs,AITA for telling my sister she smells?,"My sister has come to stay with me since last Thursday when our mother kicked her out of the house.

I live in a two bedroom home with my three children, after I left my ex husband. My boys are 6, 10 and 15.

We are already overcrowded and I have two children with additional needs. I sleep in the living room and my 6 and 10 year old share whilst my 15 year old sleeps alone.

My sister is 21.

I moved my 6 yr old child to my 15 year old’s room so that she could have his bunk bed.

She started her period on Thursday. It’s Monday. In those days, she hasn’t showered. I noticed a specific smell that was coming from the room she in since Sunday, and was getting stronger today. 

I told her in the morning that she smells and I need her to shower. She said she would shower today and my assumption was that she would do it right away when I told her she smelt.

A few hours passed and she still not get up to shower.

I approached her again and I explained to her ‘look, I love you and I want you to know that I do not mean this intentionally but you are sharing a room with other people and the smell is travelling around the house and it’s making it difficult for me to work. Can you please take a shower now?’

She said that she has a system and she needs to follow that system. She was going to shower at 12:00 but 12:01 arrived so she couldn’t shower so she was going to shower at 13:00. She felt disregulated because of her ADHD and she just can’t get up and shower unless the time is at the top of the hour.

she said she was going to wait outside the house until 13:00 and I explained to her that I was not asking that of her. I’d never ask that of her. So she started getting snarky and walked out and came back at 13:00 to shower.

She went out after her shower and when she came back home, she knocked on the door and I let her in and said hi. She ignored me and walked straight into the flat without a word.

This evening she walked past me in the living room to go to the kitchen. I called out her name because I wanted to make sure she was okay and explain that I am sorry that I may have made her feel uncomfortable earlier. She ignored me and I thought she had headphones on.

When she came out of the kitchen again, I tried getting her attention again but this time it looked like she was ignoring me. When she slammed the door, I knew there was a problem.

I followed her to my son’s room and asked if she was ignoring me and she said yes. I told her that us having a difficult conversation doesn’t mean we can’t be civil after. I asked her why she couldn’t just respond and let me know. At this point there is pure attitude in the way she’s talking to me. And she’s telling me there is no problem with tone. I’ve never experienced her talking to me like this.

I told her that I’m not sure why I should feel uncomfortable in my own home.

I said to her that if she’s mad that’s okay, she can just tell me but she doesn’t have to disrespect me.

Now that we are all in the same city, we hang out often. My friend (24f) “Arya” has a large apartment and loves entertaining so most of the time when we get together if we’re not out we are at her place. 

I have a dog that has really bad separation anxiety. He is a rescue and i spent a long time getting him to trust me. Now he trust me, but has a hard time with other people or being left alone. Therefore, I usually leave most social functions early to go back home early. All of my friends seem to be fine with this but Arya seems to be getting more and more irritated. Three weeks ago she had a party at her place and I left early. She was cold to me when I left so the next day I texted her to what her problem was. At first she skated around the issue but then she said she thought it was rude for me to always leave early. I told her I wish I could stay longer but I have to make sure my dog is ok. We then had a semi heated argument, but it seemed to end with her having more understanding and empathy for my situation. 

Two day ago, I learned from my friend “Jack” that Arya hosted a movie marathon and didn’t invite me. When the rest of my friends asked about my attendance, she lied and said I couldn’t make when she never invited me in the first place. I called to confront her about it and she didn’t seem to think she was wrong. She said that I would have to leave early anyway so what was the point in inviting me.

While she was gone a friend of ours brought his female dog Fifi over saying that Tia was supposed to watch her for him. Me and Myricole let him know that Tia wasn't there and he decided to take Fifi home and just bring her back whenever Tia came back until Myricole insisted on him leaving Fifi with her saying that she'd watch her and Flex

Myricole called Tia to let her know what happened and told her the same thing. That she'd watch the dogs. After getting off the phone with Tia she said that she had to go somewhere with her friend and told me that I had to watch the dogs. She said that if anything happened to them Tia would be extremely angry with me and try to kick me out. Her and her friend left and stayed gone for about 10 minutes and when they got back they just went straight to Tias room leaving me with the dogs. Myricole just kept coming out of the room and complaining about how I was watching them

To make matters more complicated Stacias son kept coming and bothering the dogs and causing them to almost bite him. So not only was I watching the dogs I was also watching him and trying to keep him safe. Myricole came out some time later to take the dogs for a walk and when she got back she went right back into Tias room and was playing on her phone not paying the dogs any mind

For some strange reason, he was very apprehensive to do so he’d rather pay back the money owed to the company. Suspicious isn’t it ?

It would be easier just to pay the money……… Soon after he got another job at pawnshop, about 2 to 3 weeks later he is also been terminated from that job because his cash register was “over“. Now I don’t know primarily how that works but for some reason, I’ve been told that it looks like you’re stealing because your cash register went over. he told me he did not do what he was accused of once again I tell him to fight it he opted not to. I’ve been going to that pawnshop since I was a child. My father had taken me to that pawnshop to get various things like tools, video games, and televisions, so I am a frequent customer at that pawnshop so much to where I have a relationship with some of the employees. I just so happen to ask the manager what happened to why my friend was terminated. She transparently tells me that he was caught stealing out of the cash register to pay for the bus to get home. now outside of me being a frequent customer at this pawnshop for years, this woman does not know me personally with that said she has absolutely no reason to lie to me however, I have reason to believe that he does. months later he’s applied for another job and he’s listed me as a reference, the recruiter/manager contacted me to speak on the behalf of his character. I literally said “if you hire him do not give him a job handling money “the next thing I hear he did not get the job. Am I the asshole?

My father had taken me to that pawnshop to get various things like tools, video games, and televisions, so I am a frequent customer at that pawnshop so much to where I have a relationship with some of the employees. I just so happen to ask the manager what happened to why my friend was terminated. She transparently tells me that he was caught stealing out of the cash register to pay for the bus to get home. now outside of me being a frequent customer at this pawnshop for years, this woman does not know me personally with that said she has absolutely no reason to lie to me however, I have reason to believe that he does. months later he’s applied for another job and he’s listed me as a reference, the recruiter/manager contacted me to speak on the behalf of his character. I literally said “if you hire him do not give him a job handling money “the next thing I hear he did not get the job. Am I the asshole?

40,1diame9,AITA for not putting my MIL’s Maiden name in my child’s name. ,"My fiancé (24m) and I (24f) are expecting our first child in December of this year. We don’t know the gender yet so we were picking names for both a boy and a girl. We’ve fallen in love with names already. My fiancé has his father’s last name, and that name is on his birth certificate. While his mother has a completely different last name. She has been hellbent on getting us to make the last name of our child her maiden name which neither of us have. So in my head it just doesn’t make sense. She has been very manipulative in the past with various things to the point where we have given in to just get her to leave us alone about things. This time around she proceeded to guilt trip us on why we won’t give the child her last name. She proceeded to throw the “I raised you he didn’t” card and even said she was going to go to the court to change my fiancés last name which I found hilarious seeing he’s a grown adult. Now mind you MIL has 4 sons, two of which have her maiden name as her last name and all four children are straight and have potential to bare children of their own in the future. Im trying to convince my fiancé not to give in to even hyphenating her last name and keeping it just his current last name to help set early boundaries on raising this child. But MIL has it so deep in his mind that he has to please her and that she’s entitled to make these decisions because she raised him. Not to mention she had demanded to be at my gender ultrasound instead of waiting for the reveal we have planned at our baby shower. So I’m just curious if ITA because I want our child to have his or her father’s last name and not their grandmothers. 

UPDATE: My fiancé and I have talked and we have agreed to give the baby his last name as I will be marrying him and taking the last name anyway. Boundaries will be HEAVILY set with MIL and appointments will be kept private between the two of us. I thank all of you who have validated my feelings and who have given advice as this all has helped make us realize and make him realize that this is a creepy power control thing on her end. We only want the best for baby and we need to lay the law now or it will never happen. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for not putting my MIL’s Maiden name in my child’s name.

41,1diakhj,AITA for thinking I had the right to use the communal dryer next?,"I’m dismayed and frankly frustrated by the logic a neighbor just used in the laundry room. Background- there is a basement laundry room of a residential building with 4 washers, 4 dryers. There are likely at least 70 units in the building. 

I arrived (on time) to the laundry room to take my clothes out of the wash and to dry my stuff.  All four drying machines were in use. Three had 35 minutes left (and I know for a fact that means they had left their completed laundry sitting in the washing machine for at least 15 minutes after they had finished washing without taking them out, but that’s another matter). 

One dryer had 15 minutes left. I took my wet stuff out and spread them out on the cart, and proceeded to wait the 15 minutes until the one machine would finish, as I considered that I was next in line to dry.  

1 minute is left on that machine and a neighbor  comes down and begins to remove his wash from the washer. He says it’s their clothes in the dryer, the one that I’m clearly waiting for, and I say “fine, that’s the one I’ve been waiting for,” thinking they mean they’ll remove their clothes now so I can use it. But then they claim that they will continue to use it for a brand new load of wet clothes because “he’s not done” and they’re “his clothes in there” which he feels gives him ownership to continue using the dryer, as if it was his. 

I found this appalling, especially considering I was literally standing there waiting for the machine before he even returned for his second wash. The Super was nearby and said that the neighbor was correct, that he was free to keep using the dryer even though the cycle had ended, he could start a *new* drying cycle because he “was here first” which is also what the neighbor claimed even though he literally was not there, I had been the one standing there by the machine. 

Now, I’m waiting another 15 minutes for the person who is using 3 dryers (or multiple people) to come down. If they’re not in time, I’ll be damned if I’ll wait a minute longer, 5 minute grace period before I take their stuff out so I can start my dry cycle. Imagine if they claim the same ridiculous logic that the neigbor claimed, I would be stuck waiting another 30 minutes?? I find it extremely rude and wrong. Is this the logic used by the building residents when it comes to *sharing* the machines??

42,1diabsz,AITA for finding it weird that my partner is fine with his mom sleeping on our couch in a 1BR apartment? ,"My partner (34M) and I (28F) have been together for 5 years. Since moving in with him (note that I moved out of my parents home) he is often inviting his mom over to stay for long periods with only a few days notice to me. 

Some background. I work from home and in this one bedroom apartment, I work in the dining room. We have a large breed dog that is equal to another human. When we first started dating he would have his mom over for 1-2 weeks at a time every other month. The only place for her is on the couch. Which is directly on the same room as my desk. I can’t have 8am calls comfortably because she sleeps to noon.  His mother is 70, in an unideal living situation (restrictive boyfriend that is basically a room mate at this point) and she doesn’t want to impose on her siblings or friends for a long term place to stay. 

We’ve argued about it back and forth. Coming to the conclusion later last year that she’d come four times a year, weekends only and ONLY on important events/holidays (birthdays, Christmas, etc.). Since the start of this year. She’s been coming every time she’s in town. And she’s in town a lot for visits to her doctor and to see her friend in a neighbouring city. 

I’m fed up. 

The rate on our apartment is low because it’s in her name. She does still pay 50$CAD a month for utilities but rent in its entirety (1800$), parking, groceries, dog is on us. Because I make more I pay 70% of our expenses. 

I’m sick and tired of regularly having his mother here. He says I’m selfish and don’t understand love because I can’t see his mom as family. He has met my parents once and only talks negatively about them and my siblings. He refuses to put his ego aside and get to know my family. 

Am I losing my mind (I have a personality disorder) or is this normal?

We got into a huge fight and and everyone but me eventually moved out of my home (my sister was already gone at this time). Fast forward to June of 2022 I moved into my future wife home, let my mom move back into my house, with the agreement is she pays the mortgage which is only $1200 a month. But whenever something minor happens to the house I fix it. If it break's I pay for it. My mom is not well off but I do feel its unfair I have to maintain the house while she lives in it rent free. 

During 2017 until June of 2022 my sister has cut off all contact with me and my dad, to what reason I honestly do not know. But I told my mother if she moves back into my house she cannot allow my sister to move in; my sister as a tendency to get in and out of relationships and moves around a lot. My reasoning is you cannot ignore someone and still expect benefits from them. Back in October of 2023 my mom secretly let me sister move back into my house and sub-rented her a room. I barely found out about this over this past week. I was furious I told my mom that I felt she and my sister have taken advantage of me and lied. My mom said I do not understand I do not have kids. I shot back with if my kids decided to ignore me and refuse a relationship with me than they are no longer my problem. This went on and on for about three hours. 

  
My mother and I have not had a good relationship since 2017-2018. But since then I have financed her car (she has no credit), given her money, helped her out with anything I can. Now since our fight I have come to the decision that I want to rent the house house, which means basically evicting my mother and letting her sink or swim. WIBTA? 

For context my mom is only 53 and I am 31.

44,1dia4ai,AITA for not quitting weed because my girlfriend doesn’t want to smoke anymore?,"Me (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been together for almost 4 years. Our relationship started because we became smoke buddies shortly after graduating high school, but our uses for it are very different. We both like to smoke socially of course, and we’ve spent many days smoking just for the hell of it, but my primary use for it was for appetite and sleep, as I have an eating disorder and insomnia. Yes I know there are other solves for this, and in extreme cases of sleeplessness I do have a sedative but it makes me horribly groggy in the morning so it’s really a last resort more than anything. 

Recently she’s been taking new meds that make her feel extremely anxious, and she also started experiencing some minor breathing issues (nothing major, small occasional wheeze and she has a steroid inhaler to treat it). I try to calm her nerves about it since she experiences high anxiety when it flares up, and that it’s nothing a medicated inhaler wouldn’t help. Nonetheless, she insists on not smoking at all anymore because it makes her feel MORE anxious anyways and overall doesn’t really enjoy being high. I have no issues with her not smoking and have never peer pressured her into doing so when she didn’t want to, but there were times where she willing had some anyway and same anxious reaction. 

Since this, she has now taken the stance that I have to quit with her, because she feels “left out”. I understand that it sucks to have something you used to love taken away, and I told her that I would not do it around her or offer it to her, but there are instances in which I’d still like to be able to use it. In the past two weeks I have still managed to reduce overall usage by A LOT (from multiple times daily, to once or twice every other day) but according to her this is not enough. 

It came to a head when she confronted me saying it “didn’t feel like my end goal was to quit”. Here’s where I might be the asshole: To be quite honest, it isn’t my goal to quit, at least not at this point in my life. I know there’s solidarity involved in being in a relationship, but to me this feels more nuanced and I can’t tell if I’m in the wrong here. I understand the health risks related to smoking, and I know she’s more conscious of them than I am, but to me it feels like she’s projecting her worry onto me and has now taken a sharp “anti drug” stance despite being someone has had more than just marijuana before.

45,1dia3ac,AITA for telling my brother off for leaving trash in my home?,"I 27M recently moved into my own home and I have been enjoying the independence for about a couple of months now. Unfortunately, this time my brother B 33M has separated from his wife and it used to be that every Sunday I would go over to their house for dinner and hang out with the kids but since the separation that has stopped and since I’ve my own place now, that responsibility has fallen onto me and I am happy to do it especially that’s the day I can see the kids too but it’s mainly for his benefit as he has not got his own place yet.

My brother and his family, they understand personal hygiene but when it comes to housekeeping, they’re not exactly the cleanest people for example their house has clothes everywhere the kitchen is quite dirty, the kids leave their toys everywhere, touching drink bottles with the hands they eat with leaving it greasy. Now I’m not saying I have a pristine spotless place, far from it but I do like keeping things tidy, throwing my trash in the bin, not dropping food on the floor, a pretty normal idea of clean. It should also be noted that whenever I went to their house for dinner, I would always clean up after myself, put my dishes in the sink, throw away wrappers/napkins etc.

The situation occurred today where they all came over and I came into the living room and noticed a damp napkin on the table that he used to dry his hands.

Me: “can you throw your trash in the bin? S (15) can you throw it away for please?”
B: “it’s a tissue, it’s fine, it’s just water”
Me: “why are you leaving wet tissues on my coffee table? You know I say to throw your trash away if you’re here”
B: “its just a wet tissue stop exaggerating”
Me: “it’s not about the tissue, it’s about keeping my house clean, if you’re coming here then follow my rules otherwise don’t come”

And it kept going back and forth and turned into a mini shouting match with him comparing me to my mother who’s a clean freak and other personal attacks and assuming everyone was on his side. But here’s where I think the gaslighting got intense, he randomly brought up me coming over to his and whenever I did, I would do the same thing and as I mentioned above, I know I didn’t but the words still affected.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for telling my brother off for leaving trash in my home? I 27M recently moved into my own home and I have been enjoying the independence for about a couple of months now. Unfortunately, this time my brother B 33M has separated from his wife and it used to be that every Sunday I would go over to their house for dinner and hang out with the kids but since the separation that has stopped and since I’ve my own place now, that responsibility has fallen onto me and I am happy to do it especially that’s the day I can see the kids too but it’s mainly for his benefit as he has not got his own place yet.

My brother and his family, they understand personal hygiene but when it comes to housekeeping, they’re not exactly the cleanest people for example their house has clothes everywhere the kitchen is quite dirty, the kids leave their toys everywhere, touching drink bottles with the hands they eat with leaving it greasy. Now I’m not saying I have a pristine spotless place, far from it but I do like keeping things tidy, throwing my trash in the bin, not dropping food on the floor, a pretty normal idea of clean. It should also be noted that whenever I went to their house for dinner, I would always clean up after myself, put my dishes in the sink, throw away wrappers/napkins etc.

The situation occurred today where they all came over and I came into the living room and noticed a damp napkin on the table that he used to dry his hands.

Me: “can you throw your trash in the bin? S (15) can you throw it away for please?”
B: “it’s a tissue, it’s fine, it’s just water”
Me: “why are you leaving wet tissues on my coffee table? You know I say to throw your trash away if you’re here”
B: “its just a wet tissue stop exaggerating”
Me: “it’s not about the tissue, it’s about keeping my house clean, if you’re coming here then follow my rules otherwise don’t come”

And it kept going back and forth and turned into a mini shouting match with him comparing me to my mother who’s a clean freak and other personal attacks and assuming everyone was on his side. But here’s where I think the gaslighting got intense, he randomly brought up me coming over to his and whenever I did, I would do the same thing and as I mentioned above, I know I didn’t but the words still affected. And granted it did get heated when I raised my voice and told him don’t treat my house like a slum and I tried to cut it as the kids were there and told him if you can’t follow my rules then don’t come here and it got awkward from there and that’s where I started feeling that I was wrong to do so.

I’ve been married to my husband for 3 years and we live in the US. Every year for the summer we go to his home country to visit his side of the family which is always difficult for me because I don’t speak their language. They speak Arabic and English and I only speak English. I’ve been taking Arabic classes for a while now but it’s still hard for me to understand especially when they’re all talking fast. I always feel left out of the conversations and usually there’s so much going on that it gets hard for anyone to translate for me. I understand parts of the conversation but not enough that I can contribute. Recently it will be myself and my 2 sister in laws who all speak Arabic as their native language (and yes they all speak English fluently) and they leave me out of the conversations. If my husband is there he’ll help translate and I can join in but when he’s not there they talk and laugh and I usually just sit there and go on my phone. A week ago they made plans to go to the beach and they told my husband to tell me and he forgot and told me at the last minute and I couldn’t go and when they got home they asked why I didn’t show up I told them no one invited me and they immediately blamed my husband and we left it at that. Today at 8pm my mother in law who speaks very broken Arabic and told me about wanting to go to the beach tomorrow so I brought it up to my husband and he said that the girls are going to the beach and immediately I realized that no one told me again. When we got home around 11 my SIL came to me asking what I’m going to wear in front of my husband and out of my frustration of not being invited I shouted “yeah thanks for inviting me again” in a sarcastic tone and immediately my husband took me to the room and scolded me for talking to his sister like that. I tried to explain to him that no one is inviting me anywhere and he cut me off saying that I shouldn’t talk to her like that and that I shouldn’t need to be invited by them personally that I should know I’m already included and I told him that they leave me out and he said that I’m overthinking everything and that’s not true. He told me that I was invited by his mom and I told him that his sisters don’t ever ask me they always assume that he’ll tell me and he forgets.  We’re in a huge fight because he thinks that I overreacted and that if I were to ask any person they would agree with him.

So I moved from Barcelona to London a couple of months ago as my wife and I needed to find work. I have a job but my wife is still looking so money is tight temporarily and with the move any savings we had are gone (deposit for new place, moving costs)

Anyway it’s a good friends wedding in Barcelona and my Wife is bridesmaid. We waited until 1 month prior to the wedding to let them know I couldn’t go but my wife still is. We left it as long as possible incase my wife found work but with a month to go even if she got a job we wouldn’t get enough cash in time.

I got a one line reply from the bride which was really arsey - despite me keeping my cool and I explained how gutted I am and wish I could join bla bla bla. Since then I haven’t got a message despite asking for more than a sarcastic comment - I’m. It asking them to pay or anything but just feel even the slightest bit of compassion or understanding ( we just got ourselves out of somewhat homelessness) so they know money is super hard. All it would of taken is a 1 minute reply just to be a friend and say it’s all good. We have known each other for years and have helped each other a lot in the past. 

The husband hasn’t even replied.

My wife has asked the couple that they at least reply after all we are friends and just acknowledging me would put this to rest. Since then the bride has been saying there is more to it and I have another side - I have no idea what she is on about….she also doesn’t believe we have no money… 

Anyway my wife is really confused as she is bridesmaid but knows how upset I am.


Ahh - I’m confused - what am I not seeing? Or am I the asshole?

I had talked to my dad the previous week to see if he wanted to do something for Father’s Day. He mentioned that he was going “up north” and that we weren’t planning anything. 

Another part of the backstory is that my family from Korea, Tennessee, and Virginia were coming out for a memorial service for my Uncles dad’s passing. They come out occasionally for holidays etc. (this would be my Dads sister and her adult kids) Planning is always last minute for them and the night before Father’s Day, my dad texted me and told me that they were having a gathering the next day for Father’s Day and my cousins birthday. (Mind you my birthday was this week as well.) He told me to come over if I was available but I already had the plans with my friends and didn’t feel like it was going to be a huge deal anyways. According to my aunt, they were only having ice cream and cake and it was going to be rather short. 

I decided to continue my plans to movies and celebrate Father’s Day tonight when we went out for my birthday. 

I sent my dad a text saying happy Fathers Day with some heart emojis and went on with my day.

I apologized and explained that he was supposed to be gone and we would celebrate when we could do my birthday too. He wasn’t available on my birthday so we figured we just go out to supper for both occasions. 

I cancelled my birthday celebration with him because I feel humiliated. He hasn’t talked to me since.  AITA? Should I have gone to the “party”.

I apologized and explained that he was supposed to be gone and we would celebrate when we could do my birthday too. He wasn’t available on my birthday so we figured we just go out to supper for both occasions. 

I cancelled my birthday celebration with him because I feel humiliated. He hasn’t talked to me since.  AITA? Should I have gone to the “party”.

53,1di8ujs,AITA for refusing to change the name of my book character after my sister stole her name? ,"Hello everyone. I am posting this because I genuinely can't tell if I'm in the wrong about this or not. I have been working on writing a book for almost 5 years now and one of my main characters has a pretty uncommon name that I really like for her. She was the first character I made for this book. In 2021 I lived with my sister for a few months and she loved hearing me talk about my book and hear about my characters. Back then she had three daughters. Flash forwards to this year and my sister is pregnant with my first nephew. I have been so excited for his arrival. She kept his name secret up until he was born just a few days ago and she named him the same name as my book character. I thought all was well and fine until she came to me asking me to change the name of my character since she ""doesn't want him to be associated with a book for his whole life."" 
I thought she was joking at first when she asked me this so I said no and she got really mad at me saying I was going to ruin the name for my entire family when I published my book. I didn't know how to respond so I just haven't texted her back. Am I the Asshole for refusing to change my characters name for my nephew?

AITA for calling my BIL ""intellectually lazy""?

Sorry for formatting as I am on mobile.This post will require context I'm sorry.

I (22F) have a sister (24F) who's dating Bob (26M). I'll be honest, I never liked the guy. I met Bob in a semi-professionnel setting when I was volunteering as my sister's PA for her student-owned radio show a few years back. He came around once to help the technicians for a particularly big show and was insufferable. He was horrible to the point that I told my sister I would never step foot in the studio again if he was there. My sister graduated quickly after this and the show ended so the problem was forgotten. 

Fast forward almost a year and my sister cheats on her long term boyfriend with Bob. Important to note that Bob was a college friend of the boyfriend and had introduced them. I always liked the ex bf because he was a nice guy and a good bf for my sister so I was bummed. I still tried to put on a good face and be on my best behaviour around Bob because he's the one my sister chose and it's none of my business how it all went down. I tried to convince myself he was only insufferable in professional settings and that it'd be alright in private. Wrong. I cannot do so much as express the tiniest bit of interest in something before he starts ridiculing it. Anything can be used as a mockery be it music, sports, even my literal thesis. He even makes fun of me for the interests we have in common. I just don't get it. The few times I tried talking to my sister about it she shuts it down saying it's just jokes and he has an odd sense of humour. I still want to see my sister so I take it upon myself to not react when he says shit like that about me. 

Now, a few days ago, the far right came first in the European elections and the president of my country dissolved the lower chamber of the parliament. There's barely 3 weeks before the next legislative elections and everyone is up in arms about how a political party founded by literal Nazis could get a hold on the government. So, big things. I write my thesis about political extremism and I'm very involved in politics. As I was talking with my sister, the conversation drew us to this subject. She then said that her boyfriend doesn't vote since he doesn't know anything about politics and that he is scared of doing the wrong thing.That pissed me off. Bob is a grown man, who owns and runs multiple businesses but politics are too complicated for him? In a moment of anger I regret, I told my sister that her boyfriend's disinterest in politics was coming from a place of privilege, that he could afford not to care about politics because it would not affect him in any way shape of form and that it was purely intellectual laziness with a poor excuse at that. Let me tell know it did not go well. She just sent me a text saying that if I cannot respect her man then she doesn't want to see me anymore. 

AITA for saying that about him? Should I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace (even though I do think it's true)?

His bedroom is in the basement and it’s where we stayed when we would visit them both before and after he moved out. 

BIL recently got married to someone he’s been with for a few months, and has children from a previous relationship, and FILs house is halfway between their houses so they would be there on a weekly basis staying in the basement. We tried on several occasions to meet her in this time however BIL said she was not comfortable with that, so their sleeping arrangements were predetermined. His children would stay upstairs in a spare bedroom next to MIL and FILs, so MIL would care for them while they would have the basement and not care for the kids. This room only has room for a crib for one child while the others sleep on a couch in the living room. 

FIL wants us all to come and meet up as a family and we try to twice a month, but with a 2 hr drive to get there until early afternoon. BIL and SIL get there much earlier in the day and immediately go unload all their stuff and do not indicate to us whether they are staying or not until we get there. 

Recently we left to head home and got a text the next morning from SIL about how since we left they weren’t able to do what they wanted because there weren’t enough people. They also complained that we didn’t communicate we weren’t staying the night so it was unfair to not know.  

If we stay, we are expected to sleep in the living room on an air mattress. We have never stayed the night while they’ve been there because of the sleeping arrangements. I said I wouldn’t mind the air mattress in the basement where there is some privacy for us but SIL refuses but I do not want to be in the middle of the living room. 

My partner said we were staying and were going to take the bedroom, as we don’t want to be woken up or have to sleep in the same room as BILs children. However SIL refused to let us take the bedroom saying they already unpacked as we hadn’t let them know before they got there that we were staying and they planned to have the bedroom. We had mentioned to FIL that we would be staying and no one told them. I understand they didn’t know and they had unpacked, so we just went home. 

SIL is saying we should communicate better when we are staying and that we need to tell them before they get there, so they aren’t inconvenienced by unpacking all their stuff just to move it. She also said that she didn’t know we would refuse to stay if we didn’t get the bedroom, but they have never asked if we were staying or offered us the bedroom when we said we would stay. We have been vocal about it, however they are acting like it’s news to them.

56,1di7ybq,AITA When I was angry on Father's Day,"Hello! My wife (21F) and myself (21M) have just recently moved back into my parents place due to her being 8 months pregnant, and our apartment costing too much, with no AC, and a dangerous set of stairs. I have been working as Security and constantly working overtime. On Father's Day, I came home from my shift (10:00pm to 6:00am) and she is at the apartment asking me to carry some boxes. It took me 6 hours to get all of what she wanted out of the apartment. So it is now 12:00pm, and I fall asleep until 7:00pm, because I have to leave for work at 8:45pm. My parents were extremely upset that all I did was sleep, and my wife was upset because I didn't want to celebrate Father's day, when I knew what I was getting.

There are two reasons as to why I was angry, and none of them is the lack of sleep.

1. My mom has been treating my wife very poorly ever since she met her, and the pregnancy has only made my view of my mother worse. Mother's Day, she didn't give anything to my wife. However, for Father's Day, she got me gifts, even though our baby isn't here yet. I don't find it fair that she treats my wife so poorly and I feel there is nothing I can say to her that will change her behavior. I already scolded her three times, twice in front of my father. 

2. For Mother's Day, I made my wife breakfast in bed, paid for every meal, and gave her a gift basket. Now before I say what she got me, I love her to pieces and appreciate everything she does for me...but at times I feel like she doesn't listen to what need/want at some moments. I asked for new in soles for my shoes, CD's, organizers, and other simple things. Instead she gave me a new pair of Hey Dudes. Don't get me wrong I love Hey Dudes...but they are in the most unfavorable colors in my opinion. They are white, lime green, and orange. They also have golf soles and details on the top...I never went golfing in my life. I'm angry because if she can spend the money on a new pair of shoes that I don't want, why can't she take the time to listen to what I actually want and spend less money?

Long story short, Lizzy caught Kenzie and Alex together. She told me and we had no idea how to continue. We dropped her and asked our friend who is also friends with Mitch to tell him that he was being cheated on. Kenzie and Mitch have broken up and I haven't spoken to either of them since.

61,1di78rp,AITA for not giving my neighbor back his poorly cared for kitten I found outside?,"Last week my neighbor (we live in different buildings), we'll call her Dee, and I found an 8 week old kitten (whom I've named Gogo) wondering around our apartment complex. Gogo was covered in fleas, had a visibly swollen belly that implies worms, and didn't seem cared for at all. Its kitten season so I wasn't surprised to find a lost kitty. Dee was unable to keep Gogo in her apartment because 2 weeks ago she also found a baby kitten by her car. Both found kittens were promptly bathed, taken to the vet for check ups, dewormed, vaccinated, and treated for fleas. The vet told me that Gogo was malnourished and very very likely had tapeworms in her belly. I have a 12 week old kitten, Ishii, that I found approx 6 weeks ago (she has all her shots) and I decided to keep Gogo so they could grow up together and be friends. Both Dee and I are very loving, responsible pet owners and we have the means to care for them.

As per the vet recommendation, Gogo and Ishii have been kept separately to ensure Gogo doesn't have any contagious illness. Gogo has been kept in my spare room with the blinds slightly open so she can enjoy the view. Yesterday, Dee informed me that she had a conversation with her next door neighbor, we'll call her Mia. The conversation proceeded as followed, Mia shared that her and her high school aged son had 2 baby kittens given to them by a family member, they had them for approx 2 weeks, and both of the kittens got out (they also have a dog). We live in Texas and the heat is brutal, both kittens were found very close to the building so if they had bothered to look for them they would've found them quickly. Dee showed her a picture of the kitten she found and Mia told her that he was one of the lost kittens. By this point, Dee has already taken this cat into her home and given him shots, etc. Mia agreed that Dee should keep this cat and she wouldn't tell her son about it. Dee did not initially tell her about Gogo because she wanted to speak to me first but she did ask Mia if either cat had been taken to the vet. Mia stated that they didn't have the financial means to take either cat to the vet but that her son really wanted Gogo back. 

Today I came home to a note taped to my apartment door from the son saying that he lost a cat and saw one at my window that matched the features of the one he had lost with his phone number written down for contact. Gogo has distinct features and is undeniably the cat he lost. I didn't want to lie to this kid and gaslight him into thinking he didn't see her. I typed up a message stating that we found 2 kittens in bad shape and one was rehomed, with Dee, and the other I planned to keep. At this point I don't feel comfortable giving her back to them. 

So AITAH for not giving Gogo back to people who cannot properly care for her? If she was in their home covered in fleas and had worms for 2 weeks how am I supposed to trust them to take care of her.

We both are married with kids and homes now.  About 2 weeks ago, his wife accidentally lit their house on fire cooking dinner with their gas stove.

The fire was significant enough that the fire dept could not put it out with just the chemical extinguishers and needed to use water, so despite the damage being centralized to their kitchen, they now have smoke and water damage throughout the entire floor and smoke cleaning needed on the entire upper floor too.

He was telling me his insurance doesn't do much for paying for an extended stay type of place during the work, which will take a few months to bring back to original.  Here in lies the problem.  My wife and I just purchased a brand new 2024 Travel Trailer RV in January.  It has a kitchen, bathroom and bunks for our 3 kids.  We've already booked multiple trips throughout the summer and can't wait to use it.

My buddy asked me if we could postpone our plans so he and his crew could live in it in their driveway for the 2-3 months on repairs.  I said, sorry but no.  I want to be there for him but when he sincerely and humbly asked why not, I was hesitant to unload all the negative reasons so I kind of gave him vague answers.  The truth is he and his wife and unkept people.  They don't shower daily, rarely clean anything, their cars are filthy inside, their house is a gross, cluttered mess, and they're also very hard on everything.  All 5 of them are overweight and ""slam around"" throughout life. Heavy footed, hard on doors, hard on furniture.  I'm 100% positive our new RV would come back utterly destroyed, filthy and mistreated. I also don't believe he has the funds to repair what they would definitely break, so now this becomes an issue where it's a friendship ender over something they caused.

My friend (20F) and I (20F) have been friends since sophomore year of college in 2022, as we had the same science lab together. Coming up in August would be two years that we’ve known each other. I’ll call her Mel for now.

As of this year, we’ve been distant. I figured that Mel was busy with her own personal issues on top of college, but for me personally, 2024 was a rollercoaster (was sick with covid.. again, had to put down my dog of 13-14 years in feb, been unemployed since march, emotionally absent father, tuition fees, risk of losing my scholarship, more panic attacks and extreme highs and lows, lost a friend, among other things). Despite all that, I still wanted to try and keep a good friendship with Mel, as I’ve lost too many friends and I don’t want to lose her too.



Mel has been vague with her explanations as to why she isn’t speaking to me, except for the fact that she needs space, which is totally okay! I‘ve been respecting that since February and texted her a little bit here and there (about five or so conversations from then to now). When my dog passed away, I asked her to come see me because I needed a friend, as I had put him down at two in the morning and came to classes that same day. We spoke until I stopped crying, and that was when I asked her “Am I pissing you off more recently?” To which she promptly responded ”yes”. After that, I proposed we both take some time away from each other, as she was going to the beach and I figured that would help alleviate some of her stresses or make her feel better, and we could try talking through our issues.



My birthday is in less than a week, and we’ve hardly talked since that day, February 23rd. She’s the closest friend I have and we’ve shared hundreds of memories together that I’ll never forget. But I feel like a dog begging for scraps of her attention whenever I text her intermittently and ask if she’s okay, how she’s been, etc because she won’t respond for weeks at a time.

I feel abandoned in a sense even though she doesn’t know it and I’m tired of feeling anxious and alone.

My sister and I (29 F) Just started to communicate again after I went no contact with all of my family. 
For context... I grew up in an abusive household. I would constantly get yelled at and made to be seen as the terror child. My sister on the other hand could do no wrong. With her being the youngest, It was always extremely hard to get anything done if it didn't revolve around her. 
My parents would often miss important events in my life because she decided to make something up. 
Well I went no contact when I was sixteen. Moved out of my parents house and I have never looked back. 
I met my husband when I was in college. We immediately started talking and we fell for each other. 
We married shortly after we both graduated.
Now he's not the same race as I am. 
I am Caucasian. And he's Mexican. 
I've always been told by my mother that  I should never marry outside of our race as it could ""Cause problems later on"". Fast-forward to last weekend.

Well last night I invited her over to my place to have dinner. 
She decided to bring bags with her to try to stay the night. I told her no way and I only invited her for dinner. She said fine and put her bags back inside her car. My husband was helping me cook some fajitas. We always have something special for dinner each night. He loves to cook. He gets it from his mother. 
Anyway... When my sister met my husband she immediately stepped back and pulled me aside. She very loudly whispered that he's not white and that our parents wouldn't approve of this. 
I told her that it's not her nor their place to decide who I marry. And if she has a problem she can leave. 
She said she'd be quiet and we all sat down to eat. 
Everything was going okay until she made a racist comment about the fact that he's Mexican and of course we'd have fajitas. I told her that is enough and to leave my house. She started yelling at me and told me that I'm the one who married a (racial slur). I screamed at her to get out and to never come back. I blocked her on everything and apologized to my husband for her behavior. I've already gotten several text messages from relatives telling me how horrible I am. And that I should apologize to my sister. So AITA? 


UPDATE

Thank you all for your kindness and your suggestions. 
Today has been an emotional rollercoaster. 

So for starters to everyone's concerns about me saying he's Mexican, Him and his family immigrated from Mexico when he was 2 years old. And they've all become American Citizens. So that is why I said he's Mexican and I'm Caucasian. 

Secondly, I did block my sister on everything. 
I thought she would have changed considering she has been away from my parents for 8 years. But obviously not. 

And I have explained my situation to all of my relatives. Some of which were understanding. But most of them basically shunned me for who I am. So I did in fact block all of those people. 

I'm working on changing my phone number. 

Also the ones who said she knows where I live now... We are in the process of moving across the country to be with his family. So that's the only reason why I did invite her. Because otherwise she wouldn't have been able to see me one last time. 

I didn't tell them anything about us moving. 
I also just found out from a doctor's appointment that I'm pregnant with our first child. And I couldn't be happier. 

My family has always had slight racist undertones to what they've said. But they've never gotten this far. I appreciate all of your support and your suggestions. 
",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for kicking my sister out of my house because she was racist and rude to my husband?  I (34 F) have been married to my husband (35 M) for six years. 
My sister and I (29 F) Just started to communicate again after I went no contact with all of my family. 
For context... I grew up in an abusive household. I would constantly get yelled at and made to be seen as the terror child. My sister on the other hand could do no wrong. With her being the youngest, It was always extremely hard to get anything done if it didn't revolve around her. 
My parents would often miss important events in my life because she decided to make something up. 
Well I went no contact when I was sixteen. Moved out of my parents house and I have never looked back. 
I met my husband when I was in college. We immediately started talking and we fell for each other. 
We married shortly after we both graduated.
Now he's not the same race as I am. 
I am Caucasian. And he's Mexican.

70,1di6ly8,AITA for not going to my mom's house and not celebrating her stepdaughter's baby?,"I (16m) moved in with my dad 5 months ago. My parents always shared custody of me, they broke up while mom was pregnant with me, but I made the decision to move in with my dad permanently. A few reasons for this.

1) I like dad's house better, he's around more and it feels like home with him  
2) I was kicked out of my bedroom at mom's because her husband's daughter moved in with her boyfriend because they were expecting a baby and I got moved into the office on a couch and then the boyfriend broke my school laptop because he used the office to work from and his and mom's stepdaughter's reaction was that I was a whiney brat for thinking he should replace it  
3) They also tossed out stuff that was in my old room still because mom told me stuff wouldn't fit in the office with me  
4) I was expected to help take care of mom's stepdaughter who is a total stranger to me  
5) My mom's husband is kinda a jerk and was worse after his daughter moved in

My decision to move out was controversial with mom. She was upset and angry at first and then the upset faded and her anger kept. I was asked a million questions and called spoiled when I explained my reasoning, especially at the loss of my room. I was told she would be living there and I was part time there so it made no sense to put them and a baby in the office.

My mom wanted me to go to her house to see her and I have not. It's been months since I went to her house. Her stepdaughter's baby was born too. A party was thrown afterward and I didn't go even though mom invited me.

She called me after the party and asked where I'd been and I told her out with my friends. She told me we had a new baby in the family. I told her the baby isn't in my family any more than her stepdaughter is. I told her I missed nothing and I wasn't going to be a part of that. She told me I am whether I like it or not and she told me she misses me and wants me over for dinner some nights at least. I told her no. She told me I should be grateful to have her and one day I'll regret this.

71,1di6d0i,AITA for getting frustrated at my husband because of a game?,"I (29f) was having an awful day on Saturday. My period started so I was moody and crampy, my cat vomited and I had to clean it up, things just kept going wrong. About half way through the day, I broke down crying. My husband (33m) saw me crying and asked me if I wanted to play one of our favorite games together. I thought it would cheer me up, so I logged on.

He and I each have our own Xbox, mine is older and has some issues. It usually doesn’t cause that big of a problem. My husband and I have been playing Fortnite creative recently. It’s fun for the most part, but my glitchy Xbox can make it a little less fun. I’m not much of a gamer and am still learning how to play.

While we were playing, more lag was happening for me than usual and it wasn’t helping my frustration like I thought it would. it glitched me off the map entirely and killed me. I spawned back in to an ongoing challenge, directly in the middle of the enemies we were trying to escape from. If I didn’t want to die again and lose the challenge, I had to act fast and not mess up. 

I had recently gotten an item that I had never used, and my husband thought that was the perfect moment to use it. He started saying over and over to use it. “Do it!! Now!! Throw it!! Over here!! Do it!! Get those people!! Do it now!! Come on!!” I kept asking how, what do I do, etc, but he just kept saying it over and over and offering no help. I stopped and tried to, but standing in one place got me killed. I could have won the challenge without it if I hadn’t stopped to try. 

I know my husband was being silly and trying to have fun with me, but him shouting over and over, even in a silly tone, just stressed me out. The lag already made it stressful, but trying to figure out how to do what he was telling me to while he kept telling me over and over to do it made it that much more stressful. I told him so, and asked that he not do that again. He said ok, no problem. 

Later, it was another small challenge. I was having trouble doing it and was about to stop trying, but my husband started shouting into his mic again. “Do it!! Come on!! Get it!! You can do it!! Just grab the thing!! Do it!!” 

I kept trying, but I could feel my stress levels rising again and finally had to stop. But he kept shouting. In a moment of frustration, I snapped at him. I shouted back at him to just stop, that I was already frustrated enough and he was just making it worse.

I later apologized for snapping at him, but he started defending himself. He says that he was just trying to have fun, he shouts at his friends in game all the time like that, and that if I’m that upset over a video game, then maybe we shouldn’t play together. I told him that it’s not the game I’m upset with, it’s him for continuing to do something that I had told him stresses me out and asked him not to do. He said that I’m asking him to completely change his personality and that now he’ll be walking on eggshells. 

AITA for getting frustrated?

72,1di65bh,AITA for not telling my mom that my marriage was a cover-up?,"Hi, I come from a very religious family, and so is my ex husband. We have known each other since we were teenagers, and had grown together. After finishing HS we decided to leave the church together, but it would be difficult, since both our families were very strict. 

My parents wanted me to marry someone from the same church, but wouldn't stop introducing me to older gross men. My ex husband told me that he was gay, and was too scared of coming out because he would lose everything. So I had the idea of getting married together. Of course the real story is way longer than that, but I wasn't interested in marriage and he wanted to keep his family happy, and since he was from our church my parents wouldn't protest. So we did it, stayed married for 4 years, then his parents died because during the pandemic they would do anything except for listening to a doctor.

After everything was done (funeral, inheritance, etc) we decided to move far away and loose contact with a lot of people from our church. After some time he decided to come out and we agreed on divorcing since the cover-up wouldn't be necessary anymore. I never had real romantic feelings for him, but got to love him in a way. 

Since we both like theatrics, I played the poor heartbroken wife who just discovered her marriage was a lie part. It was funny seeing the reactions of the people, except for our new friends because we were honest about our arrangement from the beginning. He is now living as himself for the first time.

  
Since this is his first pride he was so excited about it and showing off his first boyfriend, and as his ex wife I was so happy about him and left comments on his public posts.

73,1di5rpu,WIBTA if I don't let my kids visit grandma anymore?,"Relevant background: My two daughters (12f and 7f) are w/ me (42m) FT and don't have contact with their mom because of a restraining order. It's for their safety but it's hard on them. That's their mom and they love her. They have a lot of trauma from when they were w/ her and they know (to the extent young kids can) she is unwell but they still miss her and don't always understand why they can't see her. My gf and I along with school and counseling professionals have worked hard to get their mental health stabilized to the point where they've internalized they are safe and free to be happy kids.

We live a few hours a way from my mom/stepdad and extended family. My oldest (20m) is living with my mom while he goes to school. A few times a year my mom will take the girls for a few days so they can visit and we can get a break. \~6 mths ago my kids' mom moved near where my mom/family live (she also has family there). At first I didn't want the girls there anymore at all without me there. After a while and a lot of talks about rules/boundaries (where it was safe to take them, where NOT to take them, who was ok to know they were in town, etc.) we arranged for them to visit at the start of their summer break.

2 days in I saw a pic of them getting ready for church which is off limits because their mom goes to the same one. My worry is damage to their mental health if they see her and can't approach her or witness her make an emotional scene. I reached out and repeated to my mom not to take them. I later learned she did anyway. I called her, no answer. I wanted to find out what happened (maybe they somehow knew for certain she wouldn't be there?) and reiterate expectations for the rest of the visit. About an hour later my mom texted my gf and I that she was sick of being ""mistreated"" and ""blamed"" by us and that my oldest had apparently decided with my girls a plan to go and keep away from their mom if she was there.

In addition to being confused by her attack because we hadn't said a word to her yet about the situation (I called but didn't leave a vm), I was angry that she completely disregarded my request and thought that since she didn't ""influence"" them to go to church she was blameless. This isn't the first time she's abdicated responsibility when watching my kids but she had gotten a lot better the past couple years.

I want to cut the visit short and tell my mom that she will not see her grandkids anymore because I can't trust her to be responsible for them and respect my boundaries. My siblings think I'm overreacting and that it will harm my kids because they love their grandparents and they also will not see their older brother anymore while he's living there.

Edit: Thanks all for the replies. For those advising me not to go NC that was never my intent although I can see how the wording of the post implies that.

74,1di5qzr,AITA for making my friend mad over something little?,"Yesterday my friend and I were in an argument with another friend (let’s call her Talia) we were on a call Talia and her mother were talking, and after around one to two minutes she got quiet. I and my friend were doing our own thing so we didn't pay it any mind because she had done this many times, we initially thought she left to go help her mother but after say four or three more minutes I spoke up and said “Let's leave because I don't know when she's coming back.” keep in mind I repeated this TWICE because my friend asked me to. When we left the call Talia texted the group chat and said “I never left..” Me and my friend were on our call and we were confused because she never notified us in any way that she was still on the call.

Yesterday my friend and I were in an argument with another friend (let’s call her Talia) we were on a call Talia and her mother were talking, and after around one to two minutes she got quiet. I and my friend were doing our own thing so we didn't pay it any mind because she had done this many times, we initially thought she left to go help her mother but after say four or three more minutes I spoke up and said “Let's leave because I don't know when she's coming back.” keep in mind I repeated this TWICE because my friend asked me to. When we left the call Talia texted the group chat and said “I never left..” Me and my friend were on our call and we were confused because she never notified us in any way that she was still on the call.

75,1di5pkh,AITA for making my boyfriend leave our Anniversary Party Early?,"I a 41yr old female and my boyfriend a 43yr old male recently reached our one year mark in our relationship. We moved relatively fast in our relationship and moved in together after only a few weeks. We have successfully blended our families and are doing relatively well with our relationship other than some drama from our ex partners. Well my boyfriend suggested that for our one year anniversary we have a celebration with our friends and some family. Usually i would not like this idea at all because i would prefer an anniversary to be more intimate and just with each other, but i agreed to having this party. Honestly I agreed because it was highly implied that he was going to propose to me, so of course i agreed. So we decided to have the party at a small chic bar and we both invited our closest friends and some family, we even had a friend come in from out of town to play an acoustic set. It was lovely and everything was going good with no real hiccups or drama. However, the majority of the time we were at the bar my boyfriend was off chatting with everyone else. Which I understand we have friends and guests there that we have to entertain as well, but out of the 4.5 hours we were there he only spent about 20 mins with me at all. He would occasionally walk up to me and check in but would quickly leave my side and go to hang out with his friends. Now he is notorious for doing this to me every time we go out in a social setting together. He rarely pays attention to me while out and we have had many arguments and talks about how that makes me feel abandoned and embarrassed because everyone else's partners stay together through out the night and everyone constantly asks where is your boyfriend. He always gives me some half ass apology and says he will do better but I have seen little change in that area. But last night our anniversary party I was certain that it would be different, considering he planned the party and the party was a celebration of us being together, yet the entire night we were separated. Honestly I felt so stupid in front of my friends who kept asking where he was and why he wasn't spending time with me. And also btw no dang proposal!!! So I finally got frustrated of being essentially left alone most the night and tapped him on the shoulder and let him know i closed our tab and am ready to go home. He was with his friends so I can tell he felt a little embarrassed and made a joke that he had the keys so good luck and i should just pull up a chair. I said no worries I will order an Uber home and began to walk off. He immediately said goodbye to his friends and we went home. It was a quiet ride home and the next day when I tried to talk about it he said i was being dramatic. This has me questioning if ITA in this situation or if he is.

76,1di5nxb,AITA for Prioritizing my Family Over My GF,"Background: Me (22M) and my (currently ex)-gf (21F) have been on and off dating for the last 2.5 years. I currently live with my parents as I finish college and my family allows her to sleep at our house between her nightly nurse shifts as a convenience due to her commutes.

I was joining my family for a trip for my cousin's graduation and offered to invite my gf. She was iffy on coming because we would be staying with my sister's family as well, including 3 little ones, that inhibit her from sleeping. Concurrently, my grandmother on that side of the family was hospitalized and prospects were looking dire. (Update: she is much better now).

I have two major reasons now to visit family, and my nurse gf, is also invested. Her plan is for me to drive her at noon Fri (2 hour drive) after post-shift napping at my house and returning at 10pm for a 1am half shift. She picked up and negotiated her schedule so she could be free to join me. I felt uneasy about the reduced visiting time and didn't feel I had enough time to spend time with everyone in 8 hrs. She insisted she didn't have to come at all if I couldn't secure her sleep time at my house prior to departure. I reluctantly accepted her terms while cowardly concealing these plans from my parents.

My parents left Wed night to visit , while I ended up staying home alone Thurs so I could wait until Fri to drive my gf. As my gf is at work Thurs night, my dad starts drilling me about when I am coming in the next day. He is going to be pissed if I don’t leave first thing in the morning. I consult my gf and she leaves the decision to me to leave without her or stay and leave at noon. I suggested I pick her up directly from work and drop her back that same night by 1 am, to give me the maximum amount of family time. She refused this idea.

Conflicted, I woke up at 5am in case I was leaving early. She texted me that she was considering my idea, given I guaranteed her sleep. She was unable to text near the end of her shift, so I decided to drive to her work, before a response. When she got off work, she would not join me. Angry, I left without her. We got into a bad fight as she drove to my house to sleep. She expected me to turn around and stay until noon. We continued to fight through texts the entire day because of my selfishness and for being mad at her. 

I spent the day and night with my family, which infuriated her more, as she expected me to drive back after the graduation to make it up (mind you, she didn't tell me this). She had never been angrier with me. I figured she wouldn't want to see my face with how she was speaking to/about me (very cruel messages). She is furious that I didn't stand up to my dad and sacrifice for her, to match her own sacrifices. I left early Sat to spend 2 hours with her before my shift, but she ignored me.

77,1di5mya,WIBTA if I asked someone singing on a plane to stop? ,"I took a five hour flight recently where the person directly next to me was singing nearly the whole time. It wasn’t whole songs. He would randomly belt out the chorus or every other line. The result wasn’t a constant din, but there would be 30 seconds of loud singing every minute or so.

It was loud enough I temporarily damaged by hearing trying to drown him out with my headphones. When I got off the plane everything was muffled and sounded like I was underwater until I woke up the next morning.

I was not the only person who was bothered. The person in front of him looked over the back of their seat a few times, and people looked shocked as the walked past us to the bathroom. However, flight attendants passed and didn’t say anything. The reason I didn’t say anything is because I assumed he was doing it for attention. I didn’t want to give it to him. Plus, I’m always nervous about confronting people who seem a little disturbed in public. I’m a small woman, I don’t like drawing male attention and this guy seemed like he had a point to prove.

Would I have been the AH if I asked this guy to keep it down? Not necessarily stop, just sing quietly. Nobody else said anything, despite being visibly angry, so I wasn’t sure what the best way to handle this would have been.

He works in a factory and i’m a SAHM so our income is limited.

80,1di5784,AITA for not seeing my mom while she was in town?,"Hi everyone. This is one that I am really not sure. Long, sorry.

Just for some context my mom did not raise me, and we have never really been close. She wasn't ready to be a mom and let me know that originally she had wanted to do a private adoption, but my grandparents on both sides got joint custody, dad's side primary.

So she was very in and out, inconsistent as I was growing up, then when she came back to town I started not really wanting to spend time with her, because she tended to not be very understanding towards my social anxiety and smoked in the car/house.

She moved to the other side of the country last year and she comes in once a month to see her doctor. She will come in but won't give me more than day's notice; I have a 1 year old child and work a full time job. I don't get off work until 6, then use that time to hang out with my son, and then put him to bed. So it would be 7-8PM before I would be able to leave to see her. Some days I have to go into the office meaning I don't even get home until 9PM.

In April, she flew in and told me at literally the last minute. My husband and I had plans and would be out of town that weekend and let her know I am not free that week (stayed from Sat - Weds) because I am working. I had been telling her over and over to please let me know in advance if you are coming into town so I can let you know what I am doing/have going on and make plans. This is where maybe I am TA because I could have made time but it would have been extremely inconvenient for me and she wanted me to keep my son awake and bring him.

I told her let's schedule something for next month and we can hang out over the weekend and have lunch or something. She let me know the day she would be there and I said great. I didn't make any plans that weekend. I didn't hear a thing from her. She eventually lets me know she wasn't coming in. (she did but she lied)

So, I was upset but figured there must be a reason. Yesterday she asked me to come see her at a hotel and I said sure, it is last minute but its a weekend and I'm not busy. I go over there and wait in the lobby (nice hotel they have to come down to get you) and text and call and never hear anything so I leave.

She calls me and lets me know that she fell asleep and she can stop by this morning. She comes by and I am a bit upset and she is getting really defensive with me and telling me that I have to understand that my actions have consequences and that I am hurting her. I ask her, we made plans last month and you told me you didn't come in and I told her I knew she was lying. She told me she wouldn't see me last month because she was so mad at me for not seeing her when she was here for 5 days.

After close to 5 minutes of constant comments I walk up to them and say ""I understand I'm eye candy but it's $50 a lick"" and walk back to my friend who tells me to walk to class and she'll meet me there. When she catches up to me she says I'm causing issues and trying to start fights. I tried to explain that I'm tired of people talking to me like that, and I'm graduating at the end of the month so I won't have to deal with them so I can speak out. She rolls her eyes and I just walk off.

82,1di4xq8,AITA I Feel Like My Boyfriend Pawns His Son Off On Mw,"So I (24F) & my boyfriend (26M) have been together for over a year. He has 3 children while I have zero… in addition to that i’m not very experienced with kids & was an introverted child myself. Anyways, I’m starting to wonder if i’m just being stuck up or have a legitimate cause to be irritated that I feel like my boyfriend uses me as a babysitter just because i’m around. He works construction and as summer has begun his son is able to stay more often… which isn’t a big deal in theory but as he works outside I feel it’s unfair that he gets his son for weeks at a time knowing that his son will get hot and want to go where it’s cool.  therefore, he asks me if I can take him with me when possible between attending classes. Although I generally say yes, sometimes i really just don’t want to. I don’t want to talk to nor entertain his son at times… & want time to enjoy myself BY MYSELF without having the responsibility of another person… I feel a bit used because I feel as if we weren’t together and he was single he likely wouldn’t get him so often because he wouldn’t want to have him at work with him all day but because i’m around and we’re together “it shouldn’t be a problem”. Although his son is a very sweet child he is extremely hyper active and sometimes just overwhelming for me. I don’t have children of my own because I’m already aware i’m easily overstimulated. I know some people might say “why date someone with children” if that’s the case but I generally don’t mind as the mothers tend to have them most of the time… AITA?? :/ If so i’m open to hearing other reasonings… In addition, sometimes he doesn’t listen and simply behaves in way I disagree with and I get tired of disciplining him & feel as though maybe how he is allowed to behave at his moms isn’t how i personally would want or allow my kids to behave so it’s hard to not get upset with his actions at times.
I would like to add that this isn’t the first time i’ve dated a man with children but I never felt as frustrated & the honest truth is that I believe its because of his sons personality… again he is a sweet kid but he is very active and ik children are energetic but his hyperactive personality stresses me as well as earlier mentioned sometimes disclipine is an issue as my boyfriend seems to let him run wild while I’m a much stricter person. His mom has talked about seeing if he perhaps has ADHD but he’s not old enough I believe (he’s 8).I’m beginning to think I don’t like his parenting style which WILL be an issue if we later have children of our own.

83,1di4sfk,AITA for sneezing in front of boyfriend?,"When I sneeze, I sneeze 8-10 times in rapid succession. I don't know why, but I always have. I don't have allergies, that's just the way I sneeze. I don't sneeze super loud, but it's impossible for me to sneeze quietly. They're normal volume. I always sneeze into my elbow. My (25F) boyfriend (26M) thinks it's gross when I sneeze. He always makes this disgusted face. He says he doesn't understand why I can't hold my sneezes in, or sneeze just once like a normal person.

84,1di4sd2,AITA for going to a friend's birthday celebration months after they stopped talking to our mutual?,"I've been friends with Aaron for a long time. Aaron introduced me to Bob a few years ago and we've also become friends.

Months ago, Aaron's opens up to me that Bob has stopped talking to him for some reason. I initially didn't know anything about that, but maybe a few months later, Bob calls me and tells me (unsolicited) that his partner Carol is going through an illness and that Bob has gone on radio silence with Aaron for the foreseeable future while he supports Carol. 

Now, Aaron and Carol can't stand each other, so Bob doesn't want to do anything that might agitate Carol during her recovery i.e. talk to Aaron.

Bob also claimed that he had spoken to Aaron about this, but whether it's a misunderstanding or not, I don't know.

I told Bob only that Aaron thinks they've fallen out, but otherwise have tried to keep out of it as much as possible. However Bob insists that Aaron should know why he's kept away.

For months, Aaron would ask if I've heard from Bob. And I'd answer yes but nothing major would come up in the conversation. Plus I was in more frequent contact with Aaron than with Bob. However, when Bob would reach out we'd have the usual conversation and I'd mention that Aaron misses him. Again, Bob insists that Aaron should know what's what.

Perhaps two months after our last conversation, Bob messages me inviting me to his birthday. I said yes, and he invited another mutual friend of Aaron's, David.

David posted the event on his IG story, which Aaron saw and took a screenshot of and confronted me about. I said whatever is going on between Aaron and Bob hasn't nothing to do with me and I'm friends with both of them. Aaron didn't care and all of a sudden brought up something I did a year ago that he took as a betrayal. Between that and what he sees as us going between his back, he said we're no longer friends.

I was initially annoyed, but some remarks Aaron made expressing how he's really felt about me makes the whole ordeal a blessing as I don't need people like that in my life.

However, should I have not gone to the party? Should I have told Aaron what Bob's real motive was? Like I said, it wasn't my place to tell Aaron; I tried to hint to Bob to reach out to Aaron but it is what it is.

I don't regret the outcome as it's one less toxic person out of my life and my life is better off without Aaron, but am I the asshole for remaining friends with Bob?

86,1di4qlm,AITA for taking all of the clothes in my size off the rack so resellers couldn’t grab everything before I looked?,"Last week I had time and stopped into a thrift and they were just putting out stuff from their truck. I am never so lucky to be there when that happens, the shops are always very picked over with just Old Navy or Target clothes whenever I can go, so I was happy I might find something. 

I started browsing normally and was finding some good stuff for once, then I saw a group of 3 women come in. One had a little computer for scanning books, the other two had ipads or something, I assume to check resale prices? Either way they were clearly resellers and started grabbing stuff after checking labels. 

I felt a sense of dread because I wouldn’t be fast enough to check, so I just swooped everything off the rack and into my cart in my size. 

When the two got to me they started staring. I said “What?” and one was like “We’d like to be able to see what’s on the rack too.”

I said that they could as soon as I was done. 

She scoffed at me and said “That’s rude, we'd like a chance to shop these clothes too.”

I just ignored her and started looking at things one by one, taking my time, then putting them right back on the rack. The women were getting mad and snatching things basically out of my hand. I held up a nice top and one of them tried grabbing it OUT of my hand and I said “Excuse you” and turned my back to her. They got all pissy and one stomped away to get a worker.

The worker came over and asked what was going on. I said I was looking at the items from the rack, same as anyone else. They said I was “hoarding everything” so they couldn’t get a chance to look. The worker said that I wasn’t doing anything wrong, and then said to me “Thank you for putting everything back when you’re done.”

I finished what I was doing with the women breathing down my neck and took my clothes to go try on. One of them kept following me and asked me what the fuck my problem was, why I was being such a bitch, etc. I said “Sorry that you’re having a bad day, but it’s really not my problem.”

87,1di4q21,AITA for asking 2 guys in front of me at the concert to please seat down because they were obstructing the view?,"I(30sf) have been to a kpop concert with my younger cousin (13f) and due to age and both of us being very short (just a bit over 5 foot) we bought premium sitting tickets. Again due to the venue rules she is not allowed to be at the standing area due to her age.

This is a band my cousin wanted to see live for years and was looking forward for the concert since it was announced and even travelled from different country to see the show (they were not performing at our homecountry).

Now to the issue: the seats in front of us were occupied by 2 very tall guys (6 foot +) who kept standing up at each song regardless of the tune, even there wasn't anyone standing in front of them. Even with me and my cousin standing up, we wouldn't be able to see anything due to how tall the guys were and the same applied to the people seating behind us.

After a few songs I got very annoyed as my cousin was feeling upset as she couldn't see the show. I have tried talking to the guys first asking if they would mind changing seats so we can see the show too, which they declined. After I have lost my cool and basically turned a grumpy adult mode on and asked them to please glu their bottoms to the seats since there are other people in the venue who can't see the show they also paid for because of them being inconsiderate. I have also said I will consider calling a steward about this as I don't think it is fair to obstruct the entire view like that. Quite a few people on our row and row behind us agreed, while the guys in question called me a massive asshole and mood killer.

Some more info: the guys were around 17-20 and the seats were automatically allocated at the time of purchase, so we couldn't choose our seats, otherwise we would have chosen something closer. The concert in question was yesterday.

Edit: I thought I should add some information as people seem me and my cousin wanted to see the show while Sat down. The reason why I have asked the guys to sit down not because we also wanted to stay seated, but because with them standing neither we, nor the next row behind us were able to see anything while also standing due to the guys being very tall and there was very little space for movement between different rows.

She’s always scratching and licking herself more than normal if that makes sense. Her cat bed and shitterbox (lol), is next to my room too. (Did you know fleas can have sex for up to 9 hours straight) which means they’re everywhere right. Also when I came back my door was open and my mattress was spiked with cat piss and hair.

Which is totally fine..but the house is run down and disgusting as fuck. I don’t even want to leave my room and pass the flea couch 🤣

Just left my primary care and my doctor said i have a really bad case flees bites, which is obvious as the pictures show.

 the good news is that I do finally have a job. It’s retail $16 an hour. I’m not complaining at all. I’m so grateful I even found a job.

90,1di4bhm,WIBTA if I exclude my disabled sister from my wedding party. ,"Throwaway.

So I (F28) just got engaged. I am very happy but I do NOT want one of my two sisters to be a bridesmaid.

A little history on her ( We'll call her Anne- F21) I have her and one other sister (Penny- F25). Anne and I have never gotten along. She has some learning disabilities as well as fetal alcohol syndrome this causes her thinking to be somewhat immature and to have some behavioral issues, but socially she is mostly competent and she is aware of what is right and what is wrong. She was babied and spoiled as a young child and has always been entitled and abusive to those around her. As an adult she still weaponizes her trauma and disabilities to avoid responsibilities, plays the victim to avoid accountability, and throws screaming fits when things don't go her way. She cannot handle when attention is not on her in the family and wil sulk, get irritable or throw a fit, or leave if its not all about her. She also becomes verbally and emotionally abusive when confronted about her behavior and say whatever she needs to to hurt you. 

I have autism and have always refused to make excuses for her and am the only person in my family who doesn’t.. In the past my family has always tried to get me to give in to appease her. Even when we were children and Anne was clearly in the wrong I was blamed bc ""I was the oldest and responsible"".

 So when I told my family that I didn't want her to be my bridesmaid they reprimanded me. Penny told me that it was ""kinda f-ed up"" to exclude Anne especially since she was ""trying"" and ""has grown a lot"". (Yet during our engagement announcement Anne barely acknowledged the announcement, sulked, interrupted conversations and found small ways to direct the attention back to herself, eventually standing up and telling Penny that she was ready to leave while we were all discussing an engagement party.)

My family's reaction obviously upset me, and though James backed me up the whole event put a huge damper on our announcement and we left shortly after my sisters.

I reached out to Penny to talk and she told me that it upsets her that I wouldn't want Anne as a bridesmaid and thinks that I should talk to her about this which I don’t think would work. Penny also told me that if I chose to exclude Anne she would not want to be my bridesmaid either. 

I want Penny involved. I love her and want her to be a part of it. But my hurt that Penny has given me this ultimatum is turning into anger. 

It might be my own selfish perception, but it really feels like once again my family is choosing what's ""fair"" to Anne over what is fair to me. So I am considering testing Penny’s ultimatum.

WIBTA if I put my foot down and refuse to give in to my family to appease Anne on my wedding day?

P.S. this post is missing a lot of context due to ch. count. Anne has done a lot to me and James that fuel this choice. I'll answer any questions in the comments.

I (14 f) and my brother (8 m) don’t really get along. He has interests in things I don’t and he acts very weird. I can get over this because he is my brother. What I can’t get over is his hygiene my parents don’t enforce him to shower or brush his teeth he is constantly smelling bad. I don’t allow him on my bed and I don’t want to hug him or even have him near me. I also have a 3 year old sister we get along well and have a great sibling relationship.

My parents tell me it isn’t fair to favor one sibling over another and force me to hug my brother if he asks for one. I feel that I shouldn’t have to touch let alone hug anyone I don’t want to.

92,1di42pt,AITA for trying to set a boundary between my best friend and her relationship with her bf/now current ex?,"I (24F) sent a text to my best friend (23F) asking for a boundary and she called me a horrible friend.

Background: My best friend (call her Megan) was dating her ex, call him Brett, for around 1.5 years. Over the last 6 months, she has come to me to talk about his comments about her and some of the issues they had.  

Situation 1: In a roundabout way he commented on her weight and she was instantly hurt and felt like that's how he views her. She said she wasn't sure she could forgive him but that they just put it on the back burner. 

  
Situation 2: Our friends only met Brett a few times but when he was around he would attempt to make jokes about us/with us but they never had the intended effects.  When he made these jokes no one was laughing or thinking it was just a joke. he would instantly back peddle and say ""I'm just kidding"" or ""Sorry that was supposed to be a joke"". 

There are a few more things that happened but those were the two biggest ones. 

The Current Situation: This past Monday they amicably decided to split up since they both wanted different futures and couldn't give the other what they wanted. Megan wanted to reschedule a work milestone party and wanted to invite him I told her it might not be the best idea considering how fresh it is and he wanted to never break up so it gives the wrong impression. She told me that they were friends and hanging out right at that moment. A lot was leading up to this but just know what I said wasn't in the heat of the moment but on my mind for over a month. (I've never agreed with how they treated each other.) I sent a text essentially saying ""I can no longer give my energy to talking about your guy's relationship in any form anymore. I feel like you know where I stand and don't want it to affect us going forward (me avoiding him and therefore her). I still love and support you but I just don't think it's healthy for us to continue talking about it. This is hard for me to voice and has been on my mind for a while. It has nothing to do with you or him but reminds me of bad things in my past"" I ended the text by saying I am still there for her always but I just need to set this boundary for my peace and in my eyes protect our relationship. I followed up saying I would come to her milestone party but I would not engage with him. She instantly got defensive and wrote back asking what issues I had with their relationship and that she was beyond hurt and confused. She continued to say I don't know how you could ignore Brett at my party when he's never done anything to you before. I asked to speak in person she said no, more words were exchanged and then she said a real best friend would never do this to her or mention this to her and it's not fair that I did. I explained more about where I was coming from and she just said she needed space away from me.

94,1di3yuz,AITA for me (55m) being upset at my neighbor (30sF) because she is feeding an insane amount of wild birds every day in her yard feeders?,"I \[55, M) moved to this peaceful neighborhood last year that sits behind vast open corn fields, and it's been nice up until the last couple of months. My neighbor is a younger, late 20s or early 30s woman who has a husband and children. I had previously never spoken to her, and I do not wave to her because she always looks like she wants to keep to herself. I noticed when I moved in she had bird feeders in her backyard. But they were empty at that time, so I thought nothing of it.

Since February, this woman has been feeding wild birds every single day. She goes out multiple times a day because I can hear her back door open if my window is open. Whenever I hear it, I immediately feel anger. I watch her from window and the birds go crazy, flying around and chirping when she's filling the feeders and bird bath. She does this multiple times a day, and I am not exaggerating that she is feeding hundreds of birds a day. A lot of the birds are this black bird that are annoying and travel in large groups. She also has multiple suet feeders, and fills it multiple times a day with new suet cakes.  These birds eat it in hours, and she has hundreds of these birds in addition to other birds. I also have witnessed her sit outside and talk to the birds while they feed from her feeder nearby.

I decided this weekend to ask her about it while she was cleaning her patio. She got extremely rude off the bat and told me that she is doing nothing illegal. She also told me her dad raised her to be compassionate towards birds, and she enjoys it. I told her that it causes noise and it's annoying to watch and hear. Also, they land on my roof when they watch her! I didn't pay money to stare and hear hundreds to thousands of birds every day. As well as have property damage from their poop and talons/claws being on my roof constantly. She told me if I did not stop talking to her, that she would call the police. I was extremely offended by her reaction, as I thought she would be more open to feedback. I simply asked her to try to pull back and she ignored me and did not speak to me for 5 minutes while I stood there. She then intentionally put up another bird feeder from her garage in a tree and went inside.

She isn't breaking any federal, state, or local laws or neighborhood HOA laws, but it's overdoing what she is doing every day, and I'm very frustrated to hear the birds going nuts every time she goes outside. This is not a few birds this is an insane amount that come all day long.  

Because of her reaction, I went inside and the remainder of tje night felt agitated. I did speak to my wife, who does not want to get involved but told me that she did not like that I confronted the woman.

95,1di3ylp,AITA for calling my husband an  a-hole and yelling at him the day before father’s day?,"I yelled at my husband Saturday night and refused to talk to him yesterday. I did get him a Father’s Day gift and left it in the garage for him. I’m not a complete jerk.

 Backstory: I planted flowers last year ( I’m getting into gardening) last year was a rough time for me, my brother tragically passed away and gardening and watching my flowers grow was a form of therapy for me. I harvested the seeds from the flowers I had grown to save to plant this year. I also cut the flowers in September to place on his grave. I decided if the seeds grew this year I would keep up this tradition of growing my own flowers to place on my brother’s grave every year on the anniversary of his death. Granted I did not make my husband aware of the plans I had with my flowers. 

My husband is super neurotic about our yard. He likes it kept up and he puts in all the yard work. I am grateful for all the work he does. When I decided to plant my flower seeds this year I put that work in myself and placed them in a row right next to the wood line in an area that wouldn’t be in his way, so he wouldn’t have to mow around them. 

My flowers started to grow and I was so excited! They didn’t have blooms yet but the buds were forming on some of them. We have a pretty big yard so I hadn’t been down there in a while to look at them closely but I went down there Saturday night and they were all dying or dead. I came back up to the house to ask my husband if he had sprayed them and initially he said no. So I went back down there for further investigation and discovered that they had in fact been sprayed. I asked him again if he had sprayed down there and he said yes he had sprayed and that he only sprayed the weeds behind where I had planted my flowers. He said I didn’t tell him that I had planted flowers there but he was home the day I worked on it coming down every so often to check my progress, I just don’t see how he could forget. I did plant watermelon seeds that didn’t take in a small section of the row, he also claims that all he thought I had down there was watermelon that didn’t take, but he watched me for weeks run water down there and talk about my flowers! 

So I told him exact words: I hope you feel like a F*ing a-hole and that was a POS thing to do. You could have at least asked before you sprayed down in that area. This broke into an argument about how he doesn’t care about things that make me happy bla bla bla. I was basically screaming this. I was really upset. 

He told me I was overreacting and that I’m not grateful for anything that he does. We didn’t speak on Father’s Day and I’m refusing to apologize for what I said. 

I’ve since cried about my flowers and now I’ve just accepted what happened , but I’m not apologizing for anything I said. So AITA?

96,1di3qte,AITA for telling my neighbor to leave because her guest has bedbugs at home?,"My neighbor just came over to chat and told me she has a friend staying over because they have bed bugs at home. She proceeds to show me how she's bit up but says she got them at the friend's house. I promptly asked her to leave and that she shouldn't have let her friend stay. She proceeded to tell me her friend didn't tell her about the bed bugs until today after she had been staying over.

TA account. English is not my native language, sorry for any misunderstandings. 

I (M30) live in my house with my girlfriend (F27) and my younger brother (M19). I think my girlfriend is beautiful and sweet. 

Two days ago, my brother's friend (18M) was kicked out of the house by his girlfriend. I'm going to call this friend Colin. Colin is, quite simply, homeless because he has a bad relationship with his parents and with his older sister. At first, he wanted to move in with this sister but she  refused to let him into her house. When my brother told me about this and asked if Colin could stay with us for a couple of months, I  said yes

Everything was fine the first night. On the second evening, he came home drunk. He was lying on the couch in the living room where he sleeps, and my girlfriend took some of her stuff in the living room. Then she went outside with her friends. 

Colin looked at her while she was in the living room. When she left, he started saying rude things to my face about my girlfriend. Things like ""yo, she's so ugly"", he hinted that she was unattractive, etc. and giggled . I asked him twice to stop this s, but he kept doing it. 

Then I told him to pack his things and leave my house in two hours. He was in shock and tried to apologize, but I was furious. You live in my house and insult my girlfriend to my face??

98,1di3nuu,WIBTA for not providing a job reference to an acquaintance? ,"I've known this person for 2 years. We were house mates but not close, and we were on good terms. He came to the country as a student pursing his masters degree and I even helped him secure the room at the rental I was staying in. I had to work hard to convince the land lady as she wasn't interested on giving him the room, especially since he had no credit history or background as he was new to the country.

Fast forward 1 year later, I moved out to another place and he had finished his program, asked me for a job referral at my work place. Decent pay and hours, good benefits and good people. I immediately acted on his request, took his resume and submitted it to the recruiter and even pitched his profile to her. By this point, I had worked there for some years, and had built good credibility at work so they valued my words. I have provided referrals in the past for people I worked with and they ended up getting the jobs.

The very next day, they sent him a questionnaire to get to know him better before the interview, I believe that if he'd followed through the steps he would've got the job. And the recruiter even updated me - that she like my 'friend's' resume and will be inviting him in for an interview soon.

At this point, he had left the city and moved in with his brother's family 2 hours from here, but never actually told me this detail. I only found out because I hadn't heard from him in weeks so I reached out to ask if he'd heard back from the office, he said no and that he'd mentioned in the questionnaire that his preferred location was actually 2 hours away from the work place, so obviously the recruiter dropped his application since this is an in-person role.

After that we go no contact for almost a year. Eventually, we talked and he said he hasn't been able to secure any work for a year since graduation, but has been interviewing without any success. So again he wants my referral at my work place for 'any job.' While I do feel bad for his situation, hope that it improves, I'm am very reluctant to put my neck on the line again to act as his reference because I'm not sure how it will turn out this time.

99,1di3iwo,AITA for telling my friend she can’t be mad at her husband for not being a mind reader?,"So I have a friend who’s 31f who’s pretty spectacular at giving gifts. She showers her family/friends/and husband when it’s Christmas/birthday.

Every year on father days since they had their first daughter (8f) she’s always planned something elaborate and thoughtful for her husband.

On Mother’s Day her husband has dropped the ball pretty much every year. Between doing nothing at all, or plannjnh an event where she ends up doing majority of the work, he’s never done a great job celebrating her. This year he and the kids made her breakfast in bed, and said they would have a family day! 

Later she called complaining because although the pancakes they made were great, he left the kitchen a mess which she ended up cleaning.

Her husband is very traditional man despite the fact that she does work(part time) outside of the home. He doesn’t do many household chores outside of the stereotypical ‘ manly’ things like taking the trash. 

Anyways this morning I asked her what she did for Father’s Day and she said she “matched his energy”. On Saturday she ended up grilling up a storm and left the grill which is pretty much his baby a mess. She purposely did this on Saturday so when he would notice the next day he would be off from work and would clean up.

Just like she thought he saw the grill Sunday afternoon and was pissed especially since he was about to fire up some steaks.

Her husband is of course upset and asked why she didn’t clean up and in her words she unloaded on him how he doesn’t help with anything or clean up after himself and she wanted him to get a taste of her own medicine.

Although I’m one for petty karma, I told my friend you set the expectation that your fine with settling for a low experience you can’t just expect him to be a mind reader and shower you with things… she didn’t care for my response.

I told I her I understand what she’s saying but If I were her I would have left my husband awhile ago if he did what he did. Because I would never want to be someone who doesn’t want to celebrate me. But she does and after 8 failed mother day attempts her husband probably thinks he’s doing a spectacular job because she’s never corrected it just said thank you and vented to us later.


After a few choice words we ended the call. And now I’m thinking that I was little to harsh and should have just told her I’m glad he got a taste of his own medicine. So AITA?

100,1di3h71,WIBTA if I moved away without saying goodbye? ,"Background: I moved here 30 years ago. Over the years friends have come and gone. For a few years I headed up a meetup group and planned twice monthly happy hours and several large parties a year. From that I made a decent amount of friends and we would regularly hang out, go on vacations together, have parties, etc. 

Then the. pandemic hit. Of course there was no hanging out. A few of us had an online happy hour once a month but soon that petered out. Once the world opened back up I never saw anyone unless I planned it. I believe everyone was used to me being the organizer. I did post on FB that we were lonely. I got a lot of ""lets get together soon' with zero followup. For example, a friend reached out and said we should have a chat on the phone to catch up. Said she would call after her meeting; nothing. She reached out again saying she was going out of town for a week but let's have dinner when she gets back. That was two years ago. Another friend who made an offer of a joining him and his wife for dinner called after 8 months to followup. 

Over that last few years I can honestly say I have seen one couple maybe three times, another couple once and one friend over Halloween. That's it. It's been me and husband and dogs doing everything alone. To be honest, I have gotten used to it. Good thing I like my husband, lol. 

The friends I made are now just FB friends. They comment on my posts often but there is never any offers to do anything. We all live within 30 minutes of each other so distance isn't the issue. 

Back to now: My husband and I bought an RV and are selling our home and hitting road; permanently. All our ""friends"" know this as I have posted photos of our RV and our plans. Not one person said we should get together before we leave.

If you are asking why I don't just keep planning things; I got burned out. It was a lot of work to find appropriate places for large groups (the happy hours tended to be 20-40 people), and host large parties. Over the last year I have broken my foot and had five eye surgeries. We are neck deep in getting the house ready to sell (it gets listed in one week) AND we are renovating the RV on our own. I just don't have the bandwidth to deal with anything more. 

One friend suggested I post about a goodbye gathering at a local brewery and just see who shows up. I am on the fence about that since it's yet another thing I would have to plan.

101,1di3clp,AITA for telling my half sister she never deserved my mom and she can't change my mind?,"My dad had a child before he and my mom met. My half sister (33f). Her mom walked out when she was young (not sure on the age) and left her for dad to raise (they weren't together). He met my mom not long after and my mom was slowly introduced to her and they got married when my half sister was about 9 or 10 and I (22f) was born a year later.

I don't remember much of my half sister living with us. I just know she treated my mom like shit, would yell at mom for everything and anything, got mad at her for doing her laundry, got mad at her for not doing her laundry, got mad at her for looking at her, got mad at her for making her lunch, then for not making it, or making the wrong lunch. She'd get mad at mom if the school called my mom over something (like she was sick). She got mad if mom had to take her to the doctor instead of dad. She got mad at mom whenever someone implied mom was her mom even if mom wasn't there. I remember my half sister telling mom she hated her.

My mom always loved my half sister. She always thought of her as her first kid and she felt a duty to her despite everything. She was as loving to my half sister as she was to me and she never ever allowed anyone to say my half sister wasn't family. Some of my mom's family really disliked my half sister as an adult and it caused some fights. Mom would defend my half sister even when said half sister wished my mom dead.

Part of me didn't love it because I really felt like mom was wasting her time on someone who didn't deserve it. Especially when my half sister had many years of therapy, and my mom was always there and supporting her and would speak up for my half sister when required. Yet mom allowed some adult woman to treat her like shit.

My mom died a few months ago and she left my half sister a locket that's a family heirloom for us and has passed down three, now four, generations. It was always meant to go to the oldest daughter's oldest daughter and mom left it to my half sister. It broke my heart because my half sister always denied mom was anything to her. Apparently she regrets it now, especially after the locket, and she was trying to start a relationship with me after we had no relationship my whole life. I have no wish for that to happen. I told her that. She started her own personal pity party and was talking about the regrets she now has to live with and how the locket now meant so much to her. I told her she never deserved my mom, or the locket, and she won't ever change my mind. I told her I hope she feels that guilt every time she sees it. I told her I hope that locket haunts her because it's tainted being hers now. She started crying and when my dad heard what happened he got so mad at me and told me I was wrong to say those things and my half sister deserves compassion. I told her I'm tired of her getting compassion and I'm not going to show her any because she has regrets after all these years of being shitty.

I (24F) recently had a difficult experience at my husband's (28M) graduation commencement.

I was devastated to miss such an important milestone for my husband, and I spent the day watching the livestream at home, feeling proud yet sad.

Later, I found out that none of his family members attended the ceremony either, despite initially planning to do so. They traveled here from states away, driving and flying. We had a party the day before and 8 people were planning to be there. When my husband texted me feeling disappointed and alone, I rushed to get there but arrived just one minute late, missing his walk across the stage.

During the dinner afterwards, I expressed my feelings about missing the ceremony and how I would have made other arrangements if I knew nobody was gonna be able to make it. My mother-in-law, who was grieving the loss of her dog, became defensive and started yelling at the restaurant saying that she drove all this way, and you could feel her fuming over the idea that maybe she had disappointed my husband

Feeling overwhelmed, my husband and I left the dinner early. Now, his family is upset with me, claiming that I ruined the evening. But I can't help feeling hurt by the lack of support and understanding.

103,1di38cl,AITA for telling my friend I don’t want his brother around all the time?,"This most recent Friday I had an argument with a friend of mine and it's gnawing at me that I could very well have been completely in the wrong.

Both my friend and I live a couple of minutes away from our school, and since we live in the same direction we usually end up walking home together. It's always been a very refreshing and easing thing for me being able to just talk about anything on my mind really for 15 or 20 minutes without stress, worry, or fear of harsh judgement. It's a face to face social connection I value a lot.

My friend's brother (two years younger) had a falling out with one of his friends and for the past month or two instead of going to his house or going to after school clubs has been tagging along with us.

I didn't mind at first, I've known him pretty much my entire life. He's a decently cool and funny guy, but recently it feels like he's been there every time I turn around. I'm not as close to him and I'm not really comfortable being open about myself anyways. I tried telling my friend that I would appreciate it if every now and then we could go out, maybe without him. I'm not quite sure if I wasn't clear enough or if it fell upon deaf ears. Regardless, I kept trying to tell myself that I was exaggerating the issue and being super unreasonable, but I think that just made it worse in my head.

This all kind of culminated last Friday when we stopped at their house to drop their book-bags. I asked his brother if he would be okay if he didn't walk with us to my house. My friend sort of snapped at me and we got into an argument over it. I tried to explain myself again and he just thought I was being selfish.

In hindsight I do feel like a huge git and that I was being unreasonable/self centred. I'm going to apologise tomorrow regardless, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

I'm not quite sure if I wasn't clear enough or if it fell upon deaf ears. Regardless, I kept trying to tell myself that I was exaggerating the issue and being super unreasonable, but I think that just made it worse in my head.

This all kind of culminated last Friday when we stopped at their house to drop their book-bags. I asked his brother if he would be okay if he didn't walk with us to my house. My friend sort of snapped at me and we got into an argument over it. I tried to explain myself again and he just thought I was being selfish.

In hindsight I do feel like a huge git and that I was being unreasonable/self centred. I'm going to apologise tomorrow regardless, but I thought I'd ask anyway. AITA?",0.0,0.9752488732337952,1,0

A week ago a lot of things she said has caught up with me. I’ll list a few things
1. She complained about me never inviting them to my house when I did she complained and said it was filthy.To explain, I live 15 minutes away from a town where it takes her and my friend Mika(F14) 5 minutes to walk.
We usually hang out in a group so I figured it would be easier for me to come to both of them rather than bother of them come to me.I told them my house wasn’t the cleanest because I have 3 siblings and a dog so it was difficult. I did clean my room but that was all I had time for.
2. She commented about what I wear and how I look in it. This wouldn’t be so hurtful if it wasn’t behind my back. One day we went to town and I wore a crop top. Later on she mentioned to Mika how I should wear looser clothes like my other friend who is around the same weight as me.(I am 60kg and 5’4)
Though I was often insecure about my weight I’m honestly happy with the way I look now so I don’t care that much anymore, though the thought of it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
3. One day I left a few of my things behind (primer, foundation, highlighter, nails)
She didn’t give them back for a month and used everything I left behind.
4. She said I only had my first kiss for popularity but told me that he was a keeper whenever I told her how happy I was with him.

105,1di32do,AITA for moving out of my house when there’s no reason exactly?,"So, I’m(22M) from a country where children don’t really move out and it’s generally looked down upon by most people. My parents are progressive, lived a good chunk of their life on their own and both of them are self made people.

About my situation, I am just finishing college , and had started working and earning a good amount of money for about 2 years. I’ve always had the want to move out, mainly because even though my family looks very functional , inside there’s just so much dysfunction and I feel really lonely when I’m living with my parents than on my own alone. 

So I finally took the decision , spoke to my parents and took the leap to move out ( I can’t move out to another city as my girlfriend won’t have it ) to a place about 10 minutes away from my home. I felt better once I was out , not because my household had a lot of fights ( it didn’t ) but it just I never felt like a family. 

Either way , a distant relative dropped by recently and got to know I wasn’t living with my parents anymore. So they called me up and told me how I don’t care about my parents ( in our culture children are supposed to take care of their parents, which tbh every culture expects lol now that I think about it ). 

I drop by my parents whenever there’s any need from their side or mine , and keep checking up on them as much as I can. But after talking to this person while I feel a lot of anger since they don’t know about me or my life , I also feel like I might be the one in the wrong. I have a work from home job , and honestly , they didn’t have much problems with me ( on the surface ). I spoke with my parents like I did before, and they did tell me they don’t harbour any anger towards my decisions , but I can’t trust them either , maybe because they aren’t really honest about what they expect/ want from me.

I don’t want to go back to living with them because I really feel I would be really unhappy if I go back. It doesn’t make any sense since I have the perfect parents and yet it’s just I don’t know exactly what bothers me so much but I just feel really bad ( there’s issues 1-2 layers down but it’s not like it happens everyday ) .

I know no matter what some stranger says I’ll still doubt about this , and honestly while I feel guilty , I don’t wanna go back which makes me feel guiltier.

106,1di2vi3,AITA for being cautious about a 50 yo man?,"My girlfriend (21) F and I (20) M (throw away account) had a discussion about how I am a little cautious about a 50 year old man. For context my girlfriend got a camp counselor job over the summer while she is on break from school and as of this moment she does not have a car. One of the managers of the camp, who she has never met in her life, has offered to take her to work and take her home everyday while she doesn't have a car, I live two hours away in the town we both go to university and also have a full time summer job during the summer as well, if I did not I would help her get to work and back home, her parents were more than willing to let me live with them during the summer but since I myself have a fulltime job two hours away. What bugs me is this man, again, she has never even met, is being excited to take her back and forth, he does not work daily, from what I have been told, only two to three days weekly or sometimes does not even work at all.

I said there is no problem with this however I am just cautious, my girlfriend unfortunately does not always understand social queues and is not always the best at keeping information to herself during social events and/or gatherings, for example, she has said out loud during a holiday event something we do in our bedrooms activities, she had only meant to say it to one friend but she doesn't always doesn't know her voice volume or when and when not to say things like that, had she told her friend in private NOT around 25 to 30 different people it wouldn't be weird, but her and I got weird looks from people the rest of that night.

Sorry for getting off track, what I am getting at here is since she does not know this man at all and he seems oddly excited and more than willing to take her to and from work just sounds an alarm in my head, and since her and I have open communication of course I told her about this. I never said she could not get rides from him I just feel odd about the situation. She said while I am not controlling, she told me that I am over reacting and there's no need to be an A-Hole towards this guy who seems very friendly and nice.

I ran all this by her mom(her and I are very close) and she understands where I am coming from and feels odd about it too, I feel justified with how I feel but, AITA?

  
Edit: I need to clarify that my girlfriend does NOT live two hours away from her job. I live two hours away from her hometown. We met in my hometown where our university is located. We are on summer break so she is back in her hometown that is two hours away from my hometown, to which i can't drive her back and forth from work because that would be 4 hours a day, The camp is about 20-25 minutes away from where she lives ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for being cautious about a 50 yo man?

108,1di2rmz,AITA. Felt wife indirectly invited someone through her bff to a concert. ,"In January, I had a death in my family and went to the funeral which was a 3hr flight away. My wife let me know she was going to dinner and a movie with her and while I was away I called morning and night to talk to our kids after waking up and before bed and to check in with her. That night I called no answer, no response. She ended up drunk and high at her bff house after hitting a bar. My brothers x did a similar thing to him and we found out she cheated on him many years ago. I was pissed finally the next day she called and was still not home yet but otw. Her parents watched the kids while this happened. I told her that communication is key in a relationship and I felt she broke a level of trust and not sure how to handle it and keep what we had. 

   I ended up at her bff house in February to pay them for the event tickets and her bff was distant, and seemed like she had an issue with me there after I was pissed with my wife. I asked if she discussed the conversation I had with her and she said no. Which was a lie. I asked again a couple weeks later and she finally said yes she had. In may my wife went out with another friend for her birthday(not the same bff). Supposedly this friends other friend did not show up to dinner and massage so my wife found that her bff was going to a close bar and they went to meet her up. All these times my spider senses say something is off. Her bff was running late to the bar and messages her that “enjoy guy time at the bar” and they would be there shortly. Her bff brother has a long time friend that I know my wife was/is attracted to. And I saw pics of him at the bar in the background so I had to look and see what’s being messaged… that’s how I found out about the “guy time” message. She comes home as I know the local friend she was with is not on par(at least to my knowledge) with these antics. So I am still upset none of that was communicated. I said to her at that time I don’t want to attend the event in June and I am not going. I don’t feel her bff is a good influence and don’t care to be around it. So in the last week she was trying to sell the ticket to go with a local friend and that fell through.. 9-10 days ago this happened. At that time she messaged her bff that she should of just invited that guy she has been interested in, her bffs brothers friend at the bar. Fwd to a couple days ago my wife tells me her bff brother is going to buy the ticket… again spider tingle goes off and I lol at her messages to get this information after I was informed who was buying it.

109,1di2rej,AITA for talking shit about my best friend of 4 years to our common friend we knew for a short period?,"Context: I am gay and male and she is straight and a woman. We both come from similar cultures, which is North African, but different countries. To many people in that region, male-female friendships are not really common but we live in a western country so it was a lot easier. It’s even frowned upon if you throw religion in the mix. We have known each other for 4 years. She had gotten with a guy from her culture and country and he is conservative and religious. He was “fine” with our relationship but he always questioned why she had a male best friend and why we confined too much into each other. She used to sleep over at mine, see each other daily/weekly, and talk a lot.

The more her relationship progressed, the more we stopped physically hanging out. Her bf family lives in the same city we live in and she is worried that his family might see us in public together and that would be bad for her. Since we share similar cultures, I completely understood why. However, that distance had taken a massive toll on me and my mental health. I felt quite awful. It also triggered wounds and trauma from the past.

So what I did (which I feel super guilty about), I went and talked about this situation to a common friend we both know and occasionally hung out with in the past. She also is North African, hence why I talked to her. That talk gave me a very different perspective on this situation and made me realise the severity of it coz I was stuck in understanding mode and not really emotional mode if that makes sense. Mind you that before having this conversation, I was contemplating ending my relationship with my best friend and after the conversation, I was almost ready to. 

A day after that talk, my best friend called me and said she wanted to catch up. I expressed my feelings and she completely understood and we reciprocated our feelings and had open communication. It didn’t change anything but it made me feel better. 

Anyway, now I feel quite guilty about talking to that friend about our situation. I am also wondering if that friend now thinks I am a bad friend for doing so, so I wanted to ask, am I the asshole here?

111,1di2r0o,AITA for cleaning up my own puke off the floor while on the job?,"A while ago I (23M) was at work at a Ferris wheel inside of a large store. A store that had nothing to do with rides and shit. One of those southern cult stores. I was the “Ferris Wheel man” as a little girl put it 2 years ago. This was my job. 🤷🏿‍♂️

I was on shift with my coworker Krystal (39F), she was manning the control panel while I was dealing with customers. I had ended up choking on water, and had no choice but to hurl it out. With it, some green/yellowish liquid. Right where the customers walk to exit.

Clearly! this was unsanitary and unprofessional! so the second I was able I ran to our personal drawer (By the control panel) with a towel and disinfectant. The stuff basically, wasn’t sure of the names. Bend down, wipe it, spray it, wipe again, spray again. Took me like 15 seconds 

I made sure to wait until the ride was operational so I wasn’t holding up costumers and could still eye the wheel. A ways into cleaning my coworker turned around (Still on the control panel) told me it’s just water, and why I got disinfectant. I tell her I puked there and am cleaning it…

A bit more into it, she says she thinks that’s enough, and that “A little goes a long way”. I basically say her I’m not done cleaning yet…

Then she says “I’m allergic to that spray, don’t use it”

To be honest, I didn’t believe her and just ignored her afterwards. As I have never heard of anyone being allergic to cleaning products.

Was I wrong for this?

Edit: I had typed this up last night. I forgot to add, I was about 25 feet away from her cleaning the mess. 

Also forgot to add that essentially everyone I told about this **outside of work** told me I was correct for this, and that she was probably lying.

112,1di2op8,AITA for sleeping in,"My wife (38/F) and I (35/F) have been married for 3 years and together more than 10. We both have full time jobs, two dogs and no kids. We both like to stay up late and usually go to sleep at the same time. However, she seems to get by on very little sleep and I need my full 8 hours. She often has early meetings and needs to leave the house or get on a call before I do. When her alarm goes off she’s up and out of bed, right into her morning routine. I usually fall back asleep and then when I wake up I need some time to sit in bed, sometimes on my phone, to get my brain going and prepare to face the struggles of the day. The dogs stay in the bedroom with me and when I get up I feed them and we usually walk them together. Sometimes I go in to work a little later but my job is pretty flexible. 

My wife hates that I stay in bed late. She feels like it’s her responsibility to get me up, that I’m making her late for work and that I don’t respect her schedule. I’ve told her repeatedly that I’m happy to get up earlier if she helps encourage us to go to bed earlier, and also that I’m happy to walk the dogs on my own if she doesn’t want to wait for me to get up. I pull my weight around the house, we share responsibilities and I make sure to do things like prepare coffee before we go to bed so she doesn’t have to do it in the morning, since I know she’ll be up first. I feel like she doesn’t respect the fact that I need my sleep and that our schedules are just different. I recognize I have a problem with sleeping late and I don’t blame her for it but I feel I’ve given her a lot of workarounds and alternatives to help make sure it doesn’t impact her, and yet every day I’m made to feel like an asshole. Am I? 

ETA: people are asking how I am actually making her late. Honestly that is my question too. Sometimes she does miss the bus, and blames me, but I don’t really think that’s fair. We like to walk the dogs together, but I can walk them alone (so could she, though she never offers). When we do walk the dogs together, and she has to get back quickly for a meeting or to catch a bus, she gets frustrated with me that we have to cut the walk short. She does take care of some things in the mornings around the house, but I take care of things at other times. I would be more than happy to split up the morning responsibilities so she doesn’t feel like I’m placing a burden on her and have suggested this in the past. We do like doing things together, but mornings are just not a good time for me. Her judgment makes me feel stupid and lazy, when really I’m just tired and sometimes depressed. I wish she could just accept this about me, but anytime I suggest this she makes me feel like I’m the asshole.

113,1di2ebc,AITA for taking back the phone number I let my daughter use.,"Recently my daughter and I got into a bit of a disagreement over finances.

She recently graduated after I paid for her tuition. She got a well paid tech job recently and the salary is unbelievable and even includes generous stock options. I asked her to work out a payment plan to pay back the tuition and she got upset and asked me if I'll ask her brother to do so as well. 

I felt that it was unfair to even suggest as she knows he doesn't make that much and has a child on the way. He also struggled in college and had to drop out and go back and take longer than graduate. Rent was also much cheaper back then.

I then pointed out that she wasn't always responsible with finances eating out, taking dance classes, physiotherapy etc. I finally gave in but told her I'm not paying anything more.

Her phone number was registered on my name and I took it back by registering a new SIM. I then took the associated emails by resetting the password. I think I have the right to as they are associated to that number. I did not touch banking or anything else.

I only did this so I could evaluate her spending during college and I found a bunch of eating out and even donating to political causes to the tune of $100 to 200 a month.

She got upset at me for bringing this up and demanded I give her her Gmail back as she claims to have important docs and photos there although I checked and there wasn't anything much and she has copies of her photos.

I didn't want to shock people when they arrived so I figured the cards would be a nice, classy heads up for our guests.

117,1di10qr,AITA for asking if I could bring a plus one to my friends wedding,"I 25m friend 26f is getting married in a year and a half's time. 

I'd started dating my partner 28m 7 months ago, and shortly after got the news about the wedding, and was added to the groomsman party. There was a party the couple to be was holding and I'd asked if I could bring my partner with, was told no it's a private thing for close friends and I understood, and out of curiosity had asked if I'd be able to bring a plus one in general when the big day comes up. 

(Edit to clarify): The first time I'd asked to bring my SO with was to a seperate non wedding related party with our immediate friend group. After said party the topic of the wedding came up and that's when I had asked about the plus one, did so privately of course. And was told yes, I'd have to cover his attendance however which was fine. 

The answer was, fairly non committal but I was told yes, but I'd have to pay for his attendance which was fine, I was raised that a part of the wedding gift is to cover your own plate and place at the event to help the new couple. Well, a few months later I was messaged and told no one else is getting a plus one, there's not room in the budget, ect ect and that my partner can't come.

(Edit to add: I didn't argue the point, I can tell she was stressed letting me know, and I don't want to cause any issues for her and her big day. I replied that it was completely fine and I understand)

Now I understand the initial hesitation, it was a newer relationship and a year and a half is a long ways away. But that's also part of my point, we've been together 7 months, by the time the wedding roles around it'll be over two years of us being together. I realize it's contingent on us staying together. Which as it stands is fairly likely, and I had joked by that time we may even be engaged. Joke did not land well.

I just don't really know how to feel about the situation as a whole, I realize as is often said in these posts that it's their day, their rules, and I can and will respect that. But the reaction and follow up communication about it left a sour taste, and I know for a fact there are bridal party and groomsman bringing plus ones, a few would be invited to the wedding regardless so I'm not sure it's quite the same.

I may be the AH for even asking to begin with, I know weddings can be touchy subjects. But I can't get over the feeling of disrespect, and back tracked reasoning of budget when it was agreed I'd cover his attendance. It's not the only issue either, as mentioned I'm a groomsman and I've barely interacted with the groom to be in anyway, wasn't even asked to be in the party, I was told that I am without the choice or option to agree or not (I know I'm a free adult and can opt out at any time but she knows I would never do that, probably why I was asked lol) 

I also may be the AH because wedding customs can differ drastically between families. In my family, plus ones to events isn't even a question, whether it be a friend, or partner. If you want someone to be with you and share in these moments, then the more the merrier.

My overall view here is In a year and a half my partner will be a integral part of my life, and I wouldn't be comfortable not having him with me at such a occasion.

118,1di0zv7,AITA For Singing The Same Song As Someone Else At Karaoke?,"I (22F) went out with my friends (23F, 24 M, 26M, 27M) Saturday night for my first night out in a while, and I let them pick the place. They went with a bar one town over that was pretty big and doing Pride karaoke that night. They tried to get me to sing, and I said no initially, but after a couple drinks I decided I’d do it. One of my friends went and signed all of us up, and then we hung around watching the other performances while waiting for our turn. 

Around half an hour before my turn, somebody (mid 20s F) performed the song I had picked out.  I thought it was a funny coincidence (the song/artist had only recently gone mainstream so I wasn’t expecting someone else to pick the same thing as me) and I went on with my night. When it came time for my turn, I sang what I planned and honestly had a really good time. I used to have terrible social anxiety and stage fright but everyone else at the bar was fun and chill, and I was four drinks in at this point.

After I was done, my friends and I got out on the floor and danced and hung out some more. We were planning to stay until close, but pretty soon after my song was over I was approached by the other girl who sang a few turns before me asking why I “copied her” and why I “had to be such a show off”. She got angry and told me I was a rude b*tch for singing the same song as her and trying to show her up and embarrassing her in front of her date. I was really taken aback and I told her that I’m sorry if I embarrassed her, but that I literally don’t know her and felt like she was making a big deal out of nothing and to please leave me alone. She yelled at me to get the fuck out (I was guessing she was also drunk and is more animated when she’s drunk so I didn’t escalate) and I just went outside and texted my friends asking them to come out too so we could go somewhere else. 

The convo afterwards turned into a bit of an argument because none of them wanted to bar hop, but I didn’t want to stay and deal with that other girl all night. One of my friends took the stranger’s side and said maybe next time I should just practice good karaoke etiquette and pick a different song and went back in.

I (22F) went out with my friends (23F, 24 M, 26M, 27M) Saturday night for my first night out in a while, and I let them pick the place. They went with a bar one town over that was pretty big and doing Pride karaoke that night. They tried to get me to sing, and I said no initially, but after a couple drinks I decided I’d do it. One of my friends went and signed all of us up, and then we hung around watching the other performances while waiting for our turn. 

Around half an hour before my turn, somebody (mid 20s F) performed the song I had picked out.  I thought it was a funny coincidence (the song/artist had only recently gone mainstream so I wasn’t expecting someone else to pick the same thing as me) and I went on with my night. When it came time for my turn, I sang what I planned and honestly had a really good time. I used to have terrible social anxiety and stage fright but everyone else at the bar was fun and chill, and I was four drinks in at this point.

After I was done, my friends and I got out on the floor and danced and hung out some more. We were planning to stay until close, but pretty soon after my song was over I was approached by the other girl who sang a few turns before me asking why I “copied her” and why I “had to be such a show off”. She got angry and told me I was a rude b*tch for singing the same song as her and trying to show her up and embarrassing her in front of her date.

So I (F27) met this girl (F28) online in 2020 and we quickly became friends. At that time I was going through some shit: I had a swing with a close friend of mine and messed things up. In short: he broke up with his girlfriend and we became close in the months after because I was trying to support him. I'll admit it: I had a crush on him -and he on me too I think- and unfortunately we ended up in bed together. After that we drifted apart, I suffered a lot, and he got back with his old gf. Months later, since our group of friends splitted up after this shit, we all tried to go out and see if we could patch things up. Luckily, it happened: in a few years we became close again and today him and his gf are some of my dearest friends. 
Now to go back to my online friend (let's call her I.): since I met her when things were still messed up (me and this guy had just drifted apart) I talked to her about this story. She said I made a mistake and a developed a very, very poor opinion of this guy friend, let's call him P. I. remained critical of my friendship with him even after our group was reunited, and to this day she still thinks he's a moron and that I'm too kind with him. I always reassured her that I'm as kind to him as I am to my other friends, that he's very much in love with his gf now, and that after the great suffering I went through I would never go through the same shit again. But she remained critilcal.
Today me and I. had a big discussion because P. commented a post of mine on fb and I reacted with a hug (just like I did with another friend's comment). She said that he was clearly flirting with me and I was allowing it, I reassured her again but then she said something like ""I had another friend like you who forsake her friends to go after her boyfriends, I'm not going through that shit again"". I got annoyed and said to her to mind her own buisness, and that if I'll ever have another toxic situation like that she can of course leave. Of course I would never want her to leave, but I can't force her to stay EXPECIALLY if it's all my fault I'm in a shitty situation and she warned me.
Now she's angry that I didn't tell her to stay, and thinks I don't give a shit about our friendship. Considering I just took a flight to come and see her for her birthday (which is tomorrow) I'm really, really upset rn. I feel like I always make mistakes with her and she always thinks she's right. She had a difficult life and I feel bad for it, but I can't keep putting myself down for her.

120,1di0vnn,AITA for not letting a kid on the swings? ,"I (18M) was at the park with my best friend. We waited a while to go on the swings because two children were on it before we arrived, and not even five minutes after we started swinging a woman came up to us with her two children (one was less than three probably, she couldn't even stand on her own, and the other was at least five).

The woman immediately yelled at us to get off the swings because children should have priority over us, so I tell her we just got on them and we wanted to swing a bit longer.
 The woman said that ""this is a park for children (it's not, there were a lot of teens there) and we need to get off. I tell her that's bullshit and she needs to sit down and stop yelling at random people she never met before. She asks me how old I am and she goes on a tirade about how I'm problematic because I'm going on a swing at 18 when at my age she was going out clubbing.

I got pissed and got off, telling her that it shows she went clubbing at 18 considering how young she looked. She called me a bitch, I called her a bitch back and left. Then she proceeded to get on the swing herself to be able to let the toddler swing because she couldn't stand on her own and I found that baffling - there were swings for young kids available.

Edit:: The park is full of people my age or even older. There's not an age limit for being on the equipment. Thought I'd point that out.

He is single with no partner or kids, the other bedrooms are empty. When I got this job last year, I asked him if I could stay 3 nights a week for the summer (until end of August to start) for a reasonable rent rate which we did - about half the market rent given I was only staying 3 nights a week.

Some context is there were times he would talk badly about me behind my back to other friends and 6 years ago when his ex went psycho on him and he lost some friends and his parents were even against him, he was very depressed. Without him knowing, I went to speak to his parents on his behalf to get them to support him during the situation, he knows I did that now. I also helped clean up and move on past that difficult situation. Also my dad passed away a few months before this, he came to the visitation and told me ""if there's anything I need just ask.""

There were really no issues living together, I even confirmed it with him. I am very low maintenance, clean, quiet and respect his property. It was actually very good for our friendship where we would catch up and shoot the shit over beers and pizza every now and then and felt closer to him than I have in recent times.

Out of the blue in August he asks me where I'm living in September. It caught me a bit off guard as I thought everything was going pretty well and we would continue the living situation. He found another tenant for September paying full rate but did not want me staying in his 3rd available room, even for 3 nights a week. The tenant wasn't even confirmed and my friend put his consideration over my own (wouldn't even allow me to take the room instead at full rent). This tenant would only be here until December, so I had asked if I could stay for January and February to reduce my winter driving with his response being ""I'm not renting any rooms in the new year."" I had asked if I could even just stay one or two nights a week or at least when it was the bad weather days but he had the same response.

We tend to go out to eat pretty often and we usually eat a family style meal.  There were a few instances previously when we would go out to eat that she would ask Bob if he wanted a beer or coffee, but would never ask me.  Weird and rude, IMO. It would be the four of us adults and plus our kids.  She would also tell my husband, ""Bob, try this...it's good, or you should eat this.""  Again, she would not offer it to me or say anything.

My husband and I have had dinner with plenty of other couples before, and no other female does this.  If I would offer food, or ask about food, I would ask the both of them, not just the husband.  Like, ""hey guys, try this dish, it's so good!""

I've tried to have a conversation with my husband several times how I think it's weird and inappropriate that she's always trying to feed him, and that she should just focus on her own husband.  I find it rude that she would only ask my husband, but not utter a word to me.

It happened yesterday but this time, she actually took food and put it near my husband and told him to eat it.  My husband, without a second thought, just ate it up.  I got annoyed for her doing that, and then at my husband for taking the food, because, like, he should know better since I've brought it up before.

She keeps offering him food and he keeps taking it, so she keeps doing it.  I find it so annoying!  He's a grown man, and can get his own food.  Or, if the food isn't near him then I'll put some on his plate.  I always offer to get him food if the dish is not on his side.  I told my husband that I was annoyed and then he became upset because he didn't ""know what was going on.""  Again, I've talked to him about this issue before and how I feel that SIL is intrusive and over steps boundaries.  But my husband is also oblivious.

125,1di0c9l,AITA for refusing to go to my parents’ second wedding?,"This entire situation pisses me off. I (23F) have been low contact with both of my parents for awhile. The backstory is that they got divorced when I was 13, it was a drawn out shitshow and pretty awful time in my life. To be fair, I know they tried not to drag me into it, but I still ended up having to live with the chaos on top of some otherwise rough teenage stuff and the whole thing permanently changed my feelings about both of them. I do love them, but I can’t see them the same way as before and they can’t accept that, so it’s better if I focus on my own life.

Both of them dated other people but none of them stuck, although I got a half-brother out of it. Apparently last year they reconnected and started dating each other. They didn’t tell me, which is fair, but they asked to talk to me together while I was visiting for my great-grandma’s birthday and announced that they were getting remarried. It was clear that they expected me to be thrilled and for this to fix things. All I could think of is that they made my teenage years so hard just to turn around and “oops, we’re back together again, our bad”.  I congratulated them, but told them not to expect things to change much.

Ever since, my mom has been trying to involve me in wedding planning. She wants me to be a bridesmaid. I said no. They asked me to give a speech, I said no. At a certain point, I decided that I really don’t even want to go, so I told them last week. They’re both very upset and really want me there because they want this to be about the family coming back together. Other relatives have contacted me to talk about it with mixed opinions, but also lot of “be the bigger person” and “give it a chance”.

I just don’t want to go and be thinking about how all that turmoil was for nothing while everyone else is happy. I don’t want them to interpret my attendance as consent to just pretend none of it happened. But I know a lot of people would kill to have their parents back together.

All is fine, except that the woman sitting diagonally across at the table is chewing gum, and is intermittently (but most of the time) chewing with her mouth open.

I can't stand it. I hate it. I hate it so much. I can't begin to adequately describe how much I hate it. Anyone chewing anything with their mouth open drives me to absolute distraction. It makes me physically recoil - body tense, skin tingle, teeth grit, hackles rise. I hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it. I have reconsidered friendships over people chewing with their mouth open. Not so much that I cut contact, but moved from an 'I love them they're great' friend to an 'Ah, okay, you're not someone I'm going to be having over to my house ever and will avoid all eating engagements' type friend.

I'm English, and have for most of my life adhered to the English training that says if we have a problem with someone, we speak to everyone about it except the person in question, and the rules of how you talk to strangers frankly haven't moved on much in the last hundred years.

After I brought that up he snapped at me and told me to fuck off and has been refusing to acknowledge my existence since then.

She cooks food for both of us. When she can't, we just Uber/dine out. However, recently, she asked me to cook. She had just come home from a hard day at work, I’d been working from home, and I totally get it, she was tired, so I jokingly said what ""chef"" Uber has for us and she didn't take it too well, she got pissed and started telling me why I'm always wasting money instead of learning how to cook and what is so hard about following a recipe etc, and I was quite shocked, before this, I had once tried to cook for her, and it didn't go too well, we both had a laugh at the time and when we moved in together she was the one cooking for both (I didn’t even have to ask, so I was under the impression she was okay with this), we even joked about it occasionally. I told her that I don't know how to cook, and I don't see how that ever was a problem with Uber/Deliveroo around, but she started complaining about how we can't live off of takeaways and how its unhealthy and wastes money and all that, and I knew that wasn't true because we live in a major city, we've got tons of healthy options and I was totally fine with paying for us, however, she wasn’t convinced and she started asking me how I even got through uni and I had already told her ages ago, I went to a university in my city and lived with my parents, and it's not like my parents ever found it to be an issue, my mum always cooked for me and would go out of her way to cook food for me whenever I was hungry. In fact, my mum had told me on numerous occasions to go and find a woman who'll cook and clean for me herself. 

I communicated all of this to her (obviously, not exactly like this) but then she went on a rant about how she does most of the household chores, but I told her that she literally told me not to the last time I tried to wash the dishes, she was laughing watching me do it and told me I wasn't doing it right and told me to stop and did it herself, so I didn't think she felt so strongly about that either.

130,1dhz8ew,AITA For not telling my Dad Our Fathers Day Plans Earlier?,"My brother (24M) and I(26F) planned to take my dad out to lunch/dinner for father's day. I called my dad yesterday to ask him if the time I picked worked or if I may need to push it to give him time to change after church was over. He informed me his wife was handling dinner. 

For context my dad has been married to this woman for 2 years and has no kids with her. 
I told him that our plans should come before her plans because we're his actual kids. He told me that we should have told him ahead of time we had something planned or should have talked to her. I told him we do the same thing for father's day EVERY YEAR like clockwork so why would this year be any different. We told him we let her pettiness slide last year but he's been essentially choosing her over us since they got married. For context, last year we ran into this same issue where we arrived for our scheduled dinner to find she cooked him and her dinner and her excuse last year was she forgot. Also no we don't resent our dad for getting married, he changes wifes/girlfriends like underwear so we could care less he's remarried again. The only difference is it seems he's prioritized this wife over everyone in his life for some reason.  We also tried to compromise and say can they just push their dinner later and he said no. Our reservation was for 2:30 and their ""dinner"" was them just picking up food from Piccadillys and bringing it home to eat. We said you can still technically do both because 2:30 isn't dinner time! 

So to try and sum this up he thinks we should have talked to him or her ahead of time to say we've planned something. My brother and I think we shouldn't have to because we're his kids  obviously he should plan for us to have something planned and if nothing else we do the same exact thing every year so why would it be any different now. However he says when he married his wife she is apart of everything he does now. I just think she has him for 364/365 days she can't spare one day just for him and his kids. I feel like before she planned anything she should have come to his kids. 

If this story seems familiar I deleted the other one because my friend said I left out key details and jaded people's opinions. We've never had this issue with any other wife. Other family members think my dad is wrong but him and his wife don't think they did anything and my dad says we're all thinking with emotion rather than logic and I said the last person to think with emotion rather than logic is your autistic child lol. We have a routine why are we suddenly deviating from the set tradition. I just think it's unfair we're being forced to include her when he doesn't force her to include us. This is the one day we had with him and she took it away.

131,1dhz7fy,AITA for feeding squirrels,"I (21F) live at home with my father (47M) and my grandfather (88M). I recently put up some old bird feeders I found in my shed. I thought it was a considerably innocent thing but my neighbour seems to vehemently disagree.

My neighbour is the standard crazy old woman. She sits and looks out her window to call city by-law officers on people whenever she can. We're no stranger to her treatment but my grandfather refuses to put his foot down with her and tries to play everyone's side despite how poorly she treats him. I have heard her complaining to my grandfather about the animals in my backyard, and that I'm ""having too much fun"" in her words. In every conversation he just agrees with her and then moves on, in fact he often talks to me about the birds and squirrels when he sees me watching them; never has he made a big deal out of it to me.

We share a fence in the backyard that we split the cost on, my grandfather actually ended up completing the construction because the contractor couldn't deal with my neighbour anymore and just quit. I sprinkle bird seed and peanuts on the fence sometimes to encourage the animals to come down and so they can sit up high enjoying their snack.

Yesterday I saw my neighbour on a ladder pushing the seeds and peanuts down to my side of the yard. Although petty, I figured sure, she can push them over and I can just go put them back; so that's exactly what I did. She yelled at me and proceeded to run inside to call my grandfather. After berating him about it she hung up on him, he then came over to me and laughed about it. He saw her in her yard and stepped outside to speak to her. I have truly never seen someone so angry about squirrels. She began screaming about 'creepy crawlies' and that the squirrels knock down her fence lights (they are bolted to OUR fence). This went on for almost five minutes, just screaming at the top of her lungs about suburban wildlife. My father came over and after explaining to him he just further agreed she must be looking for things to get so upset about. My grandfather came back inside and just gave an exasperated sigh and laughed before leaving.

We have done so much for my neighbour. Constantly doing repairs for her free of cost, yardwork, etc. We shovel her driveway, she uses our garbage bins so she doesn't need to pay for her own, we bring her dinner on on occasion so she doesn't have to cook herself. She has tried to walk into our house on numerous occasions when nobody/only I was home. My grandfather pities her since she is alone in her old age, and my father pities him since the neighbours my grandfather befriended when immigrating here have passed away. She is always the first to ask for neighbourly help but has never once done anything in return but complain and call by-law on us when she can. I believe the way we treat each other matters when considering the context of this peanut situation.

In every conversation he just agrees with her and then moves on, in fact he often talks to me about the birds and squirrels when he sees me watching them; never has he made a big deal out of it to me.

We share a fence in the backyard that we split the cost on, my grandfather actually ended up completing the construction because the contractor couldn't deal with my neighbour anymore and just quit. I sprinkle bird seed and peanuts on the fence sometimes to encourage the animals to come down and so they can sit up high enjoying their snack.

Yesterday I saw my neighbour on a ladder pushing the seeds and peanuts down to my side of the yard. Although petty, I figured sure, she can push them over and I can just go put them back; so that's exactly what I did. She yelled at me and proceeded to run inside to call my grandfather. After berating him about it she hung up on him, he then came over to me and laughed about it. He saw her in her yard and stepped outside to speak to her. I have truly never seen someone so angry about squirrels. She began screaming about 'creepy crawlies' and that the squirrels knock down her fence lights (they are bolted to OUR fence). This went on for almost five minutes, just screaming at the top of her lungs about suburban wildlife. My father came over and after explaining to him he just further agreed she must be looking for things to get so upset about. My grandfather came back inside and just gave an exasperated sigh and laughed before leaving.

We have done so much for my neighbour. Constantly doing repairs for her free of cost, yardwork, etc. We shovel her driveway, she uses our garbage bins so she doesn't need to pay for her own, we bring her dinner on on occasion so she doesn't have to cook herself. She has tried to walk into our house on numerous occasions when nobody/only I was home. My grandfather pities her since she is alone in her old age, and my father pities him since the neighbours my grandfather befriended when immigrating here have passed away. She is always the first to ask for neighbourly help but has never once done anything in return but complain and call by-law on us when she can. I believe the way we treat each other matters when considering the context of this peanut situation.

132,1dhz1zc,AITA for reacting about how my bf keeps a “girl friend” company while she’s working the night shift?,"I have this long distance relationship with a guy from the US, I’m from Philippines. I’m a law student, while my boyfriend works from home. We have this time difference, so late night talks and videocalls are normal for us. I study til 5am, so we get to talk almost everyday. I don’t mind the videogames and discord chats, and all the notifications I hear, I don’t question anything. 

But I noticed this change; whenever I take breaks from reading and check up on him, I would catch him smiling and chatting. One day, I asked him who it was and he said just a friend. Over time, it just continued and I must admit I don’t know much about video games so I just thought it was about those games. Then came this day, I was talking to him on video call, asking his opinion about a dress. And there he was, on videocall with me, but responding to this “friend” and smiling, totally ignoring me.

I confronted him and he said it was his friend, who sent him random messages. I got mad and as his way to deescalate things, he said it was just his friend thanking him. Well, apparently this “girl friend” is already married but whenever she works the night shift, instead of messaging her husband, he messages my bf to keep her company. And I got mad at that. My bf got mad at me for reacting, told me that it’s normal in the US, and maybe it’s just cultural differences and that I have lame friends cause my friends don’t keep me company like he does her. And that sharing videos between each other at 1am is normal. 

So, I wanna know the logic here, why my bf? why not her husband?

The dress was great I loved it. But I was told 3 days before my wedding not to wash my hair so curls held better. So I didn’t. I also had to paint my own nails the night before, they were AWFUL and literally looked like a child did them bc it was purple with blue tips to match the wedding colors but literally it turned out awful and I tried to fix it with glitter on top but that made it worse. I was rushed doing them too bc I was being forced to go to bed by my mother saying I needed sleep before the wedding since we would be needing up early. Sleeping with them freshly done also was a terrible idea. Just bad bad on all accounts. Well that morning my dad had left first bc he had a lot to do there at the venue for me and everyone else then becomes eager to just leave. But not everyone can fit in the one car that was left. So they all decided to leave me alone at the house and I get a ride with my hair dresser. I felt this was insanely stupid but whatever that’s what happened. I got left alone in the house waiting for my ride on my wedding day. The lady decides to take her time and arrived an entire hour late. So now I’m late for my own wedding. My hair looks like a greasy disgusting pit. My nails are awful. I’m hating every second. We get there and since I’m literally an hour late, everyone is like where’s the bride she needs to get ready-all hair and makeup was being done AT the venue. So I said do my hair while my makeup gets done. She literally does not even curl it. My hair looks so bad it’s like a rats nest and I can not even look at pictures today 8 years later bc I literally cry at how awful I look. She decided to stop working on my hair and focus on my bridesmaids hair over mine. Livid is an understatement but I didn’t want to cause a scene on my wedding day. Everything was just the worst to say the least. So this time around, I want to plan a wedding I actually will love and look at pictures and not literally break down crying.

He also has a place to change at work and lockers. He wears his dirty greasy uniform home daily and sits on our sofa in said uniform. He could put down a towel or change clothes when he gets home. He could change into a clean uniform at the end of the work day and wear it home/work in it the following day. He could wear regular clothes to/from work changing upon arrival in the mornings. Ive mentioned all of these options and its ignored. He's borrowed someone else's car before (he rides a motorcycle) and took one of our towels to sit on (if he uses my car on rainy days, he wont do this) I've asked, yelled, and nagged him for a long time now  to please figure out some way to stop turning our furniture black. I avoid having anyone come in our home because the sofa looks so bad. He's walked in the door to find me scrubbing the sofa before and walks back out of the room immediately without speaking. He also takes the dirty uniforms off and piles them up in a ball in our coffee table taking them to work once a week. They stink up our living room all week. He does not get all of the grease off of himself although he showers nightly which causes our sheets to turn black on his side of the bed. Ive even showered with him to shown him where hes missing areas, trying to help. He just made it sexual and laughed. When I complained about the sheets he told the guys at work who made jokes about home and gardens magazine taking pictures of our bedding, then came home and repeated the jokes expecting me to see the humor, I was far from impressed. I love this man and dearly want to resolve this but asking repeatedly, pleading, trying to compromise, or even yelling at him, none of it is changing his behavior. I feel SO disrespected as he makes no effort to clean his grease. Ive tested how far this could go, and it was over six months before I gave in and cleaned the damn sofa. After four years of being married I'm having some serious resentment issues around what didnt seem so serious at first. Hes teaching our son by example to not care about cleanliness which is even more frustrating.

Due to my depression and anxiety I’ve grown a little dependent on being with my friends, as it’s become one of the only things that can get me out of bed. I’m always happy when I’m with them. I love to invite them over and write them letters of appreciation for everything they do every once in a while. I make them hand made gifts. I’ve been recording during this whole senior year and made a 30 minute long video about our friendship and what it means to me.

The problem is most of them have never thanked me once. There are two or three of them that do, however when I wrote all of them letters for the holidays they all brushed it off and never mentioned anything about them. 
Whenever I ask them to hang out they’re never willing to, however if it’s someone else planning something they instantly agree. 

Maybe from their POV they don’t feel the need to show their affection towards others that much. 

The tipping point for all of this was yesterday. My friends came over after months of planning. I finally showed them the 30 min long video I’ve been creating. Some of them were on their phones while we watched it. At the end, I only recall one of them saying how it was good and thanking me.

I also did a google forms to ask them who they’d want to sit next to at lunch since we’re a lot of people and I felt the need to organize the seating chart so nobody (me) would get left out. All of their answers included two or three people but nobody included me… Even the people who I would’ve mentioned.

So obviously all of this has been weighing down on me foe a while. I’ve expressed to them how I feel and they said they would do their best to make me feel appreciated however their behaviour hasn’t changed at all.

I also participated during the school year in getting each of them a gift for their birthday and they didn’t even get me a card nor said a happy birthday to me…) Anyways, I didn’t go because I was feeling quite down and nobody has found it strange that I wasn’t there.

They all just got back home and I instantly see that they’re all thanking my friend for hosting the party and saying how happy they were and stuff…

140,1dhy9bt,AITA for sharing texts between me and a guy I’m sleeping with to my best friend?,"I am close friends with a couple (Boy + Girl). Girl is my best friend. Recently, I met Boy’s best friend, B2, and we hit it off. We started hanging out and sleeping together. B2 has known Boy for 20 years and Girl has known B2 through Boy for about 10 years. I have been keeping Girl updated with developments about how it’s been going with B2. 

B2 originally told me he was in the early days of seeing someone but things have evolved since then. In the throes of providing Girl with an update, I said I had been having lovely chats with B2. Girl invited me to share the texts, which included snippets about a book we all planned to talk about together as well as funny jokes about sex dreams. It didn’t seem intimate, more playful and reflective of the dynamic at play, and I shared them to get Girl’s take. 

Boy asked Girl what she was reading and Girl said she was reading texts I sent through. Girl read out a sample of texts to Boy as she was laughing at some of the jokes we made. Boy felt like B2’s privacy had been invaded and that he needed to tell B2 that his messages had been shared by me. I freaked out because the dynamic with B2 is new and it seemed like a disproportionate reaction. I also wanted to dissect the messages with Girl. Girl shared the texts in order to let Boy in on the dissection of the dynamic and jokes exchanged. 

Boy + Girl had a big disagreement about it. 

Am I the asshole for sharing? Or is Boy the asshole for wanting to tell his friend that I have shared the texts and therefore invaded his privacy?

141,1dhy53i,WIBTA if I didn’t go to the expensive night in historic hotel as planned? ,"My husband’s brother announced a month ago he was coming to visit with one of his kids and not his wife. No explanation. We’re happy to host and got tickets and plans for various activities. I like playing hostess but it always seems to go sideways when it’s his family. There’s s common thread with his dad and brothers where I’m treated like something between a child and a maid. I have to sit in the back seat, no switching. I’m not consulted on plans, the men walk and I’m expected to follow. If I ask questions my husband gets annoyed. He is the youngest in his family so my theory is he is conditioned to bend over backwards for them. They put golf and old football on the tv. If I talk about something un-sports related, his brother will just interrupt or talk over me or change the subject. If I try to share something interesting about our city or state, he one ups me with something equal or better about his city or state. After a whole day of it I feel pretty unappreciated and overlooked. But I’m HoStiNg. 

His wife indicated to me they’re having issue with one of the kids behavior but wasn’t specific when we texted a week back. She always talked about wanting to visit and now it’s just him. I asked him about it (casually) and he says she has to work. Well that’s an obvious lie and I’m angry to be lied to. But I understand if things are rough I’m not exactly entitled to the nitty gritty.

143,1dhxo77,AITA for comparing my best friend (M30) to other men?,"So long story short: My (F29) best friend (M30) met a girl a couple of months ago and he fell head over heels for her. I'm beyond happy, because he had been rather unlucky in the past when it comes to love. Things are still evolving between him and his new love interest, so I understand that she is somewhat the priority right now.

Important to know: 

a) 2 years ago he admitted to having developed feelings for me. I didn't reciprocate. I know it did hurt him at the time, but luckily we overcame that ""issue"" and our friendship grew strong again. 

b) He did tell me two weeks prior to the following happening that the girl he was seeing was jealous of me.

Now, onto the issue:, I've been hospitalized two weeks ago while he was out with her. He was texting me about an issue he had with her, and I replied, and then let him know that I was just admitted to the ER. He did send me a message wishing me luck and telling me to keep him posted. I did send him a quick message basically stating that I still had to wait on the results from the lab.

That was Thursday. Friday, I didn't get a message from him. Saturday I did send him a quick (admittedly rather cold-assed) text to enquire about the situation with the girl, after the issues he had Thursday. He said they were okay again, nothing more. Sunday passed, Monday, Tuesday,... no message. Wednesday I sent him a message telling him I was hurt he didn't care about how I was doing. On Friday he sent me a message stating I was right, but not even an apology. So I got mad and I sent him a voice message along the lines of ""ok, I get you're happy with this girl now and I am so thrilled for you, but you're acting like any other man - as soon as they meet another girl they'll abandon any other female person they have in their life!"" The message was 2 minutes long and I used at least 1min30 to tell him I kinda understood he made her a priority right now, but that it made me feel sad anyway - and then in the other 30 seconds I pulled the comparison to other men that were previously in my life (so like, my previous experience).

144,1dhxch6,AITA for leaving my father a nasty letter? ,"TW: May be considered heavy abuse. (Sorry, this is very long.) 

For context, I (17FTM) have two younger brothers, one we'll call Jameson (14M) and the other Wayne (9M). Throughout my whole life I had worshipped the ground my father, who we'll call Michael (40ishM) walked upon. He was my hero the moment I was born. I have purely fond memories of him up until at least 3rd grade and even then I had hope for him. Jameson was born shortly after me and he was my everything, my only friend. I watched as my father destroyed his life. From the day he was born, we all knew what would be in store for him. The day Jameson stood up for the first time, he pushed him down. My father is obsessed with creating violent and strong children. He wanted my brother to be just like him; to lead down the life he walked. When my brother rejected him as a child, running to my mother and in return acting more flamboyant, he was beyond furious. My brother constantly got in trouble in school because nothing else mattered to him, Micheal was going to do something to him regardless. Since I was the only girl, I was his treasure. I was as fragile as glass and needed a protector; Jameson. When Micheal realized I was ""stronger"" than my brother, he gave up on him and focused on me. Jameson turned out to be gay, Micheal knows even though he isn't out of the closet and every day he is yelling or screaming at my brother for acting too feminine around him. I never laid hands on my father growing up, being too weak, he always overpowered me when he would make me box with him or wrestle with him. The first incident where I really intended to hurt him, he grabbed a hold of my mother and I pushed him down with all of the force in my body. I was 16 at the time. I told him if he ever touched my mother again, I wouldn't go easy (I know I can't really win, I'm 5'2 and he's 5'9 but I couldn't stand still.) I'll never forget my mother saying I was the only one who ever stood up for her to him and all I could think is how disgusting society is for letting Innocent people suffer. I told her that she was my mom and I wouldn't let anyone hurt her. I can never forget the night I had to stay on the phone with a 911 operator, fighting back tears, keeping Jameson from crying as my father threatened my mother with a kn1f3 saying he would k1// her and himself because he found out she dated someone when they weren't together. If that doesn't give you a good picture about the guy, I'm not sure what will. My mother always warned him that one day, teaching me how to take him down specifically was going to screw him over. She said it in a joking manner but only when I was in ear shot, I think she was trying to tell me that. After finding out again, for the millionth time that her husband was cheating on her, mother finally decided it's time to leave. We packed our bags, everything we needed and wanted to keep and our cats. I wanted to leave him a letter, I wanted him to know he was dead to me. That if he tried to track us down I wouldn't allow it. I hoped for so long that he would change for his family, but he always made the same mistakes over and over again. That he was only Micheal to me now; I have no father. That was a long explination but I figured a backstory would help explain what I wrote. 

I put as such for his disgusting eyes to observe: ""Let this serve as a plead for you to listen to me just once and as a warning. You have never been there for us. I am the only one who remembers those nights you were gone. Days, weeks I would never see you. I always wondered why my hero always left me, why he made my brother cry. I watched you hurt my brother. I warched and prayed to a God that has abandoned me that it would all stop. I was helpless to you; you made me watch everyone I love suffer under your hands. You're nothing but a monster. I'm not a defenseless kid anymore. I won't hesitate to do what I need to so I can protect my real family. The ones that never left me. Don't show your face, you're dead to me.

You ruined everything since the moment you stepped back into my life for the final time. Now I'm leaving yours and for the sake of the family who cared about me, don't let me see your face anymore.

145,1dhx5vc,WIBTA if I ask someone to return something while they’re in mourning ?," I (27F) used to live out of state. Once my lease was up I stayed with a friend (24F) for a couple months to figure out if I wanted to stay or go back home. My friend always has a pretty full day just with the friends and family she has but we still talked everyday. Now I’ve lived back home for almost 6 months and I can only get a hold of her like once a month and every time we do end up talking it was a whole fiasco on why we didn’t talk for so long. Now, while I lived there I had this water service where I get the big jugs of water delivered and I rent a water machine. I let my friend keep it because it’s more convenient for her situation. Well she hasn’t been using the service and I can’t “pause” the service, I can only skip deliveries. But I can only “skip” it by making sure my bank doesn’t have enough money for the transaction. I’m tired of going back and forth trying to make sure this money doesn’t come out. And I feel like I’m doing a favor for someone who I feel dropped by. Now I messaged her like 3 times “hey, what’s up, etc”. Last night I was like “can you just contact me tomorrow please”. And she finally got back to me but she may need to put her dog down, before that the dog bit her, before that her and her dad got in a shou-lin show down, before that she had to travel to see her dying grandmother, before that she was getting into big arguments with childhood friends. Like every 3 weeks it’s just a crazy update and then complete silence and I guess it hurts because we lived together and talked and saw each other everyday, even when we didn’t live together.

And she finally got back to me but she may need to put her dog down, before that the dog bit her, before that her and her dad got in a shou-lin show down, before that she had to travel to see her dying grandmother, before that she was getting into big arguments with childhood friends. Like every 3 weeks it’s just a crazy update and then complete silence and I guess it hurts because we lived together and talked and saw each other everyday, even when we didn’t live together. And now I can barely get a call. Either way…I’m tired of fucking around with the water delivery account. WIBTA if I asked, in the midst of this, for her info so she can put it outside so the company can pick it up ?",0.0,1.0553268194198608,1,0

So, I'm an international student so I am surrounded by local students in my course. I am an introvert person, but when it comes to academic, I try to approach people or discuss with other students about homework, projects, presentations etc. So few weeks ago, we had a group presentation, I was in a group with three females (they're locals) and it seems like they're friends, they just asked me to join them bc I didn't have group that time so I said yes. I didn't wanna get a 0 mark for the presentation. It was going well at first until I was the one who had to the PowerPoint presentation because they were not responding on our group chat that much, they keep reasoning, so I ended making it, but at least they were able to send me information or details. So, I let it pass.

On the day of presentation, they didn't talked that much, I did most of the talking because they would just read what's on the PowerPoint without any explanation, they would just read it and they'll be silent till I end up explaining. So last month, the Professor asked us to make like a review, or an evaluation of some groups presentation. It's super easy. Our group chat was still up so I messaged them like when do they want to do it, the due date was in three weeks so we have a lot of time, making this project wouldn't even take you a day. I told them we should finish this as soon as possible so it would be off of our to do lists, because our finals are coming up, I have other projects to do. They said we'll do it on the weekends. Weekends came, I didn't hear anything from them. 3 days before the due, I haven't heard anything from them but I see their Instagram stories of them going out. I ended up sending a private message to my Professor asking if I could submit my own, and I explained to him my issue, I also told him that I cannot wait for other people as I have other projects that are also due in a few days. He thanked me for informing him and told me that it's fine to submit my own which I did.

So now, the girls are messaging me about the project because apparently they were not graded but saw in the sheets that I have a grade, I haven't been responding to them and they're calling me a prof's pet and other names, saying I am selfish for not messaging them.

147,1dhx263,AITA for telling extended family that my parents and siblings blame me for being bullied?,"I (17m) have a stutter. It's pretty bad and worse whenever I'm anxious or going through heightened emotions in general. People find it hard to understand me. It was always hard for me to be comfortable talking around new people and it was very few people I would say much to or around. It was just too embarrassing and people weren't always kind. 

When I was 8 my parents moved us to another state. It was really hard for me. I was upset about the move and my parents scolded me for reacting negatively instead of positively and they were dismissive over my fears of talking around so many new people. They told me it was the best thing for our family and I needed to give it a real shot and turn my attitude around because being so down about it wasn't fair to my siblings (all younger) who deserved to have a fun and exciting move.

The move sucked honestly and how miserable I was about it was cemented when I started being bullied on my very first day of the new school in the new state. One kid heard me speak to the teacher and he was mercilessly cruel about my stutter. Kids called me Retarded Red because of him, the nickname sticking for 8 years and it wasn't just him that bullied me but other kids joined in too. Any time I came close to making friends the bullying got in the way.

It got really bad in high school and my mental health suffered as a result. My siblings could be just as bad, sometimes even calling me the nickname because they said I was so miserable that I deserved it. There was an incident last year and my mom's parents got involved and told my parents to send me home to them, my parents refused, it became a back and forth fight and in the end my parents moved us back home. But my whole family resented me for it. They would comment that I never did anything to make the bullying better, that I wanted to be bullied so we could go home, they said I shouldn't have let the bullying get as far as it did. But I told my parents and they did nothing. I told the school and they ignored it except for a couple of bigger incidents. Heck even my siblings adopted the nickname so what was I supposed to do.

Things with my family are so bad and when we had the whole extended family together for the first time, talk went to us moving back after so long and it was clear my family weren't happy with the move back and they were asking why they were acting like it was such a big deal. My dad told them only one person wanted this fucking move and for the most ridiculous reason too. They asked what that meant and I said they blame me for being bullied which forced us to move back. My parents yelled at me to leave the table and my siblings started bitching about me being ""such a retarded bitch"". Everyone was yelling after that and my parents told me after I had no business saying what I did.

My girlfriend was going into town to have a look around the shops on Saturday and asked if I wanted to come. I needed some fresh air anyway so told her I'll come as long as we're not longer than 2 hours which she agreed to. 

Things were going well, we grabbed a coffee and had a look around the shops. We had been out around an hour and 45 mins when she bumped into someone she knew. They started talking and showed no signs of wrapping u the conversation. 

25 mins passed and they were still talking. I tried talking to my gf but she just asked me to wait. I ended up getting frustrated and getting a taxi home while she was still talking to her friend as my gf was the one who drove. 

When she got home she was annoyed and said I had embarrassed her in front of her friend but I just pointed out she knew I had to get back and revise and still kept talking to her friends. 

She said I should have waited but I just reminded her that my revision is important and I had no idea how long she was going to be.

She said I was completely wrong for leaving her and that I should not have done it.

We made breakfast and gave my dad the gifts we bought for him.

I thought maybe it would be better if I just stayed away to avoid causing any problems. My psychologist suggested this when I can't stand being around him but I think this only works when we're at home; I can go to my room and nothing happens. At the moment, I thought my only problem was that I couldn't hide my emotions.



We went to the park, and I tried walking faster than them, but my dog slowed us down by stopping to do dog things so they kept catching up to us. After my dog finished her business, I tried again to distance myself from them and so on.

When we arrived at the park, we went straight to have lunch. My dad gave me the second wake-up call, telling me to act like a normal 17yo and not like a 5yo. I went to a relatively close bench to eat but my biological brother kept looking at me every second. This annoyed me so I moved to a spot where no one could see me. Third wake-up call, I still didn't said a word.



After lunch, I took my little brother to the playground and then found a place away from where my parents and biological brother were sitting. We were supposed to go to a nearby center for a walk afterward, but my dad had had enough, and we went back home. He was furious.



He said I was worse than my biological brother and mom (people with reduced mental abilities) because I know what’s wrong with me but don’t do anything about it. He said I act like a 5yo and am ungrateful of all the help, things, and efforts they provide to ensure I have a peaceful life. He said that if I continued with this attitude, I would end up in a psychiatric facility, relying on pills to avoid being hysterical. He felt that I don’t seem to make any progress with my psychologist in this theme, he said that i dont contribute at all in maintaining the peace in the family. That when situations like this occur I take the role of the victim creating problems out of the blue, suffering for no reason. He said they want to find a solution but I don’t help. He thinks I want to change my biological brother, which is ridiculous, I just want to stay away.

Morning went good. We made breakfast and gave my dad the gifts we bought for him.

I thought maybe it would be better if I just stayed away to avoid causing any problems. My psychologist suggested this when I can't stand being around him but I think this only works when we're at home; I can go to my room and nothing happens.

Me (40 F) and my husband (39M) just moved into a new home with our 2 young kids. My in laws and I have always struggled with boundaries, especially my mother in law. I admit I am a bit particular about home decor and clothing, etc. I have a pretty strong sense of style. My husband is really go with the flow and doesn’t really have much of a sense of style so defers to me. I probably should have seen it as a red flag that his mom bought his clothes and did his laundry until we moved in together. To be clear I don’t do either now as he is a grown person and I think he can handle those tasks himself. I mean, I’ll throw his laundry in with mine, but I don’t go out of my way to do those tasks for him. We both work full time. Anyhow, I digress. So my mother in law constantly brings things to our house to decorate. She has never had a job and spends most of her time at the mall buying gifts for other people. I appreciate that she is trying to do a nice thing by giving gifts. But she is constantly bringing things over that we don’t want or need. Every time she comes over she brings gifts. Multiple times a week. I’ve asked her and my husband has asked her more than 10 times to stop bringing things. They typically don’t fit my taste and I hate that I end up with a lot of stuff I don’t know what to do with aside from donate. Anyhow at our last home they brought us an American flag to put up on our front porch. I’m politically very left leaning and feel the flag has become more of a symbol for the right. Maybe I’m wrong. But I’ve heard others express the sentiment too. At our last house we said thank you and the flag went into storage. They asked why we didn’t put it up a few times and we just kinda said this or that and it never came up again. So back to our new house. They brought one over last night and it was up on my front porch before I even knew what was happening. I was upset. I’ve been working nonstop to make our new home a lovely place to live functionally and esthetically. And this was just my breaking point. I want to make decisions about what goes on the facade of my home. My husband seemed to think I was overreacting and my mother in law said you can’t be this upset about a flag.

More background: my husband is an on and off again  recovering alcoholic. More recently not so recovered. He has been going through detox for the last week while I care for the home and the children. I’m on edge. So I got pretty snappy and was pretty short and rude. I spent some time in the garage trying to self regulate but couldn’t adequately get myself to stop being a bit of an asshole.

She told me no and that the company I booked with would go over all the rules during orientation the following day… Never once during orientation did they state washing our own socks/underwear with our own body wash in the sink is strictly prohibited, nor does it say that on the packet of rules we were given. So, when I asked my host mom yesterday if there was space on the clothes rack for me to lay out my underwear to dry, I thought nothing of it. Especially since I’ve laid them out to dry several times before since I’ve been here (there’s usually plenty of space, this is just the 1st time I asked permission). It also isn’t uncommon in the solo traveler/backpacker world to bring few underwear/socks to save packing space and simply wash them weekly or so in the sink. 

My host mom and I have always gotten along very well, so when she came to my room door upset, 5 minutes after I hung the underwear up to tell me that the company doesn’t allow us to wash our own clothes, I was surprised because clearly this is her own rule that she arbitrarily made up. She told me to look it up on the sheet of paper I was given, as I said, it wasn’t there, so then she told me to call. As I was in the room looking up their number, she came back with the manager on the phone. The manager said that it was inappropriate to wash my underwear in the bathroom sink… what’s the difference between someone taking a bird bath and washing underwear in a sink? Rinsing a bloody nose down the drain? What exactly makes it inappropriate because lots of gross things go down the drain all the time… like bacteria from fecal matter when some people wash their hands. 

Honestly, I’m taken aback by my host mother’s behavior. This whole time I thought she would be grateful to not have to touch my underwear when washing my laundry. What if they accidentally get stained with period blood? I’m just supposed to leave it there for her to wash in a week? That’s humiliating and an invasion of privacy, not to mention ruined underwear because the blood would just sit on them. What about my bras that I only hand wash? My speculation is that since we have to pay for laundry service from our host parent based on the quantity of the load, she sees it as less money that she could be earning. I think that it’s absurd to tell someone they aren’t allowed to wash their own underwear and socks with their own body wash.

162,1dhto0d,AITA for turning down a trip to Disneyland after my ticket was payed for,"For context I 17M have been living with my grandparents for the past mont because the living situation was better. (I might get into that in another post)

So to start off with my parents first reached out to my grandparents and asked of they would be interested in watching their kids  13m, 10m, 7f, 4f, while they went on a 3 day trip to Florida. My grandparents declined as my younger siblings are uncontrollable and too much for them to handle (this has been done in the past, but in those cases, my parents would just be gone for a few hours).

 So they then reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in going with them and the rest of my siblings to Disneyland Florida. I said I would consider it, but yes, I would be, I then forget about this convention as these happen quite a bit and don't lead anywhere. Two days later I get a text saying my tickets have been booked and we leave the coming Monday, they would also be coming out to grandparents to live for 2 days (this was known for a few months now). Anyways after picking them up at the airport at 3:15 am I start to get excited for the trip as I always wanted to go to star wars galaxy's edge which was at the park we would be going. The next day I bring this up and they say how they won't be going near that side of the park and stay in the complete opposite section of the park and that I would be needed because of pictures and managing the kids. This had me pretty disappointed, on top of that I'm starting to feel sick and say that I don't think it would be in my best interests in going as my sister is also  coming down with a fever. They persist in saying that they already bought my ticket and a white polo shirt. At this time, I learn they also want to take us an hour out to the beach, which was not said prior. At the end of the day I go to mother amd explain to her all the reasons I don't think I should go, she then goes on to say how disappointed she is for me not wanting to spend time with family, my father then walks in the room and asks what's going on the conversation goes as follows:

Father: What's up?
Mother: OP doesn't want to go on our trip
Father: Those figures I knew this would happen

I'm sitting there confused because they previously stated that if I didn't want to go, I didn't have to. My father then yells at me for being entitled and a spoiled brat for not wanting to go with them, he then tells me to leave saying ""he doesn't want to see me again"" and slams the door in my face. I stand there in shock, trying to process the events that transpired as I hear comments from my parents.

M: Don't yell at him it makes you no better than him
F: Why do we even invite him, we knew he would act this way, and I don't want him going along because his attitude is going to ruin our trip
Their trip is today, and I feel horrible for this, AITA?

So to start off with my parents first reached out to my grandparents and asked of they would be interested in watching their kids  13m, 10m, 7f, 4f, while they went on a 3 day trip to Florida. My grandparents declined as my younger siblings are uncontrollable and too much for them to handle (this has been done in the past, but in those cases, my parents would just be gone for a few hours).

 So they then reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in going with them and the rest of my siblings to Disneyland Florida. I said I would consider it, but yes, I would be, I then forget about this convention as these happen quite a bit and don't lead anywhere. Two days later I get a text saying my tickets have been booked and we leave the coming Monday, they would also be coming out to grandparents to live for 2 days (this was known for a few months now). Anyways after picking them up at the airport at 3:15 am I start to get excited for the trip as I always wanted to go to star wars galaxy's edge which was at the park we would be going. The next day I bring this up and they say how they won't be going near that side of the park and stay in the complete opposite section of the park and that I would be needed because of pictures and managing the kids. This had me pretty disappointed, on top of that I'm starting to feel sick and say that I don't think it would be in my best interests in going as my sister is also  coming down with a fever. They persist in saying that they already bought my ticket and a white polo shirt. At this time, I learn they also want to take us an hour out to the beach, which was not said prior. At the end of the day I go to mother amd explain to her all the reasons I don't think I should go, she then goes on to say how disappointed she is for me not wanting to spend time with family, my father then walks in the room and asks what's going on the conversation goes as follows:

Father: What's up?
Mother: OP doesn't want to go on our trip
Father: Those figures I knew this would happen

I'm sitting there confused because they previously stated that if I didn't want to go, I didn't have to. My father then yells at me for being entitled and a spoiled brat for not wanting to go with them, he then tells me to leave saying ""he doesn't want to see me again"" and slams the door in my face. I stand there in shock, trying to process the events that transpired as I hear comments from my parents.

M: Don't yell at him it makes you no better than him
F: Why do we even invite him, we knew he would act this way, and I don't want him going along because his attitude is going to ruin our trip
Their trip is today, and I feel horrible for this, AITA?

My partner, 27, and me,23, live in an apartment in his parents house. My partner will take over the house soon, as it is tradition in his family. He has two brothers, who both inherited either a house or a place to build a house from their father. 
We built in a door, so you could reach the apartment seperately instead of a shared entrance since we wanted some privacy. My partners mother is really sick sadly, we still left a door between our apartment and the house, so we would be able to help if there is the need for it. In the past, we made clear, that if there was the need for it, to use the door. If there wasnt something urgent, to just use the doorbell on our main entrance like a visitor would. This has worked pretty good, except for one point. His brothers have children ranging from age 1-5, who like to visit us when they are over. Which happens probably at least 2 times a week. 

The problem is, that they will use the 'emergency' door, entering our apartment without our knowledge and roaming our rooms. Both when we are home and when we are not there. It happened more than once, that we found things missing and in his parents house, things messed up or children running into the bathroom when u r using it or changing or whatever.

We said, if this doesnt stop, we will lock the door and wont open anymore. 

Now, BILs say, we are TA because we want to lock the only door that will allow us to help their parents, while we say, we are NTA because our privacy isnt accepted.

169,1dhsqbx,AITA for not giving in,"Hi everyone!

The story goes like this: me and my boyfriend live with rent in my hometown in Romania. We recently decided to move into another apartment, due to the fact that the one we lived in before that was owned by a childhood friend of mine and he kept mentioning about wanting to sell it in the near future (we didn't know when this would be).

My friend (let's call him Mike) didn't want to sign a contract because he didn't want to have to pay taxes and so on. We agreed to this, given the fact that we've been friends for half of our lives and me and my boyfriend were in kind of a desperate living situation at that time. We moved into his place in January 2023 and moved out 8 days ago.

Now, here's where the situation begins: all 3 of us are smokers and I would have loved for the apartment to have a balcony because I detest the smell of smoke inside, however, Mike's apartment didn't have one, so with his complete approval we smoked in the kitchen (windows wide open, we even bought an air purifier to help keep the room as clean as possible).

Mike was visiting us very often, because that's how he was used ever since we were kids, so he also smoked a lot in the kitchen. He came by and left as he pleased. In the first month when we moved into his place, he stayed with us because he didn't want to go to his mom's place for one reason or the other
(He's 31 years old, same as me, but acts like a kid sometimes).

We couldn't tell him anything, given the fact that we didn't have a contract and didn't want to get kicked out, so we endured.
When we left his place, we left everything as clean as we could, but sadly, the kitchen walls turned a bit yellow-ish.

When you rent a place, it goes like this: you pay for the first month + a deposit in case something breaks/needs repairs. We were paying 500€/month for a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment.
When we left, we talked to Mike about the deposit and he said he'll have to see what repairs need to be done and how much it will cost him, which was fine.
Yesterday he called me to tell me that everything is fine, besides the kitchen walls which obviously need repainting. The kitchen itself is not very big (around 20 M2). He then proceeds to tell me that the deposit we left him, which is 500€ is not enough for repainting and that he wants another 500€.

I did some research and I saw that it can't cost 1000€.
After the research, my boyfriend decided to step in and call Mike to tell him that what he's asking from us is absurd and we didn't have that kind of money, to which Mike's reply was: do what you will, but if you don't pay, delete my number and forget we were ever friends and after that he hung up in my boyfriend's face.
This was obviously not the outcome we wanted, we would've wished for all of us to come to an agreement.
We spoke to several of our common friends, and almost all of them agreed that he's being greedy and absurd.

Hi guys! So this one is pretty low stakes compared to what you may find on here, but here goes. A bit of background: my sister usually lives with me, but she's off to another city for work for this month. She usually takes her guinea pig but last week she was going to be traveling so she asked me to keep it for a week. I agreed under one condition: that she come back the next weekend so I never have to change the cage. I'm quite allergic, and don't want to have puffy eyes for the rest of the day, though it's not deathly serious or anything.

On thursday I ask her when she's arriving this weekend, no answer. On friday, same question, this time she says she doesn't know yet. On saturday when I ask her when she's coming, she says she's actually decided that she can't make it this weekend so she asks if I can keep her another week. I say no, I need her to come get her this weekend. She says she'll send her boyfriend over to do the cage and I can keep her another week. Again, I say no, and that I'd only agreed for a week. To be honest, her guinea pig is rather loud, always squeaks to eat, and it makes me anxious that I can't pick her up because of my allergies, I'm scared that she'll get depressed or something and I feel really bad to leave her in there.

She said that she'll come over on tuesday, then changed her mind and said that her boyfriend will bring the guinea pig over to her, but that I'm an asshole for not keeping her an extra week, and my mother agrees with her and says that I am overreacting to something that isn't too a big a deal. This is not the first time she's pulled something like this so it's just ""how she is"". To me, she didn't have anything to do this weekend and could have come pick her up.

I ended up leaving that school in December so Rylee only had herself.

Rylee was doing cheer at school, and on her cheer team was Kiera. I discovered Rylee had become friends with Kiera which upset me and Alaya since Rylee even knew what Kiera had said and done to us. But we let it pass thinking that she didn't have anyone else, over the past few weeks I have been getting into arguments with Rylee about how she had been defending Kiera and her behavior during that time. Alaya broke off her friendship with Rylee since she couldn't believe that Rylee would defend that type of behavior.

I didn't end the friendship thinking that I could change her perspective on the situation but I couldn't. During these arguments, Rylee had been going through something with her own family and I had decided to tell my mom that I wanted to break off my friendship with Rylee. My mom had ended up telling me that I shouldn't break it off with Rylee for something somebody else did to me and that if it was that bad Rylee would figure it out on her own.

Since that happened Alaya moved school so it was just Rylee and me but during the school year coming up I didn't have any classes with her the only time I got to see her was during lunch, I mostly saw Kiera since she was in my class. I ended up leaving that school in December so Rylee only had herself.

Rylee was doing cheer at school, and on her cheer team was Kiera. I discovered Rylee had become friends with Kiera which upset me and Alaya since Rylee even knew what Kiera had said and done to us. But we let it pass thinking that she didn't have anyone else, over the past few weeks I have been getting into arguments with Rylee about how she had been defending Kiera and her behavior during that time. Alaya broke off her friendship with Rylee since she couldn't believe that Rylee would defend that type of behavior.

I didn't end the friendship thinking that I could change her perspective on the situation but I couldn't. During these arguments, Rylee had been going through something with her own family and I had decided to tell my mom that I wanted to break off my friendship with Rylee. My mom had ended up telling me that I shouldn't break it off with Rylee for something somebody else did to me and that if it was that bad Rylee would figure it out on her own.

172,1dhsmeq,AITA for going on vacation with friends and not communicating it with my other friends ,"
Hi, so I (female 21) have a big friend group of around 10 people. We usually get along fine and get together a few times per month. A few years ago, we tried to set up a vacation with all of us, but it didn’t work out because no one could find the same exact time to go. So we went with 7 people, leaving the other 3 behind. The other three were fine with it and wished us fun.

This vacation was kind of a disaster because of 2 people specifically. Let's call them Danielle (female 20) and her boyfriend Markus (male 21). They micromanaged everything, told us what to do and where to go at all times, and overall, it was not fun.

Last year, I came up with the idea of going to Ibiza with a few people. I asked in the group chat and said I could bring 4 people (my family has a vacation home there with space for 4 extra guests). The first four who responded went with me. Danielle and Markus were not part of this vacation and got extremely upset, calling us names and saying we weren’t real friends, etc. We offered to have them come if they booked an Airbnb nearby, but they only agreed if we split the bill with them. We tried to accommodate and communicated every detail, but the booking got postponed so much that it cost us a lot extra (almost €200 each). We couldn't find a solution and decided to go to Ibiza without them. They got very mad and said we cannot go on vacation without including everyone. The other 3 people from the first vacation were also not going, and they were okay with it. It’s just Danielle and Markus who were upset. They imposed a rule that you can go on vacation if it’s just 2 people, but if it’s 3 and above, you need to invite everyone.

Fast forward to this year, I found that rule stupid and asked my four best friends in this group if they wanted to go to Spain. They said yes, and we started planning. My grandma surprised us for my 21st birthday by purchasing rooms in a beautiful hotel for each of us, so it was quickly decided we would go. We knew we had to tell Danielle and Markus somehow because just going without telling them would make them very upset. We postponed it, and two months went by without telling them, making it awkward. I finally told them kindly what the plan was and that it wasn’t intended to be rude.

Well, this backfired. They became extremely upset. When I first told Danielle, she was okay with it, but then I received a text from her that they were actually extremely mad at me. They were upset that my friends and I didn’t communicate and just booked the vacation without them. We somewhat understand, but we just didn’t want to go through the whole thing again like last year.

So, AITA?

174,1dhsjme,AITA for not helping my dad with paperworks?,"I have been managing the family finances for the last 7-8 years. Mostly in terms of paperworks for mortgage refinances, taxes, the occasional renovations, self managed retirement accounts and some other things.

Recently I have been having difficulties in keeping up with dad’s paperworks, and have actually caused delays in a few things that luckily resulted in no financial losses. I have raised that he might want to hire someone to sort this out for him and he seemed very upset at the suggestion. Believing that I have completely taking my mum’s side.

 My parents have separated back at the end of 2022. My dad have resented my mum for cheating since then and they are not on talking terms. My dad is working and living overseas and my mum is living in the same suburb as me.

Just for additional information my dad is technically my stepdad however we have been together as a family since I was 2 and I have always seen him as my dad.

I have been still helping mum with her financial affairs. However her things take usually no more than 3-4 hours every month. Dad’s things are a bit more complicated and can take much longer as he is out of the country and that he usually wants the paperwork done to the point where he just needs to review and sign.

I have been very busy since last year due to my promotion and that my workload is a solid 50 hours a week. I am also going to be honest in saying that i have definitely sided with mum a bit more for some selfish reasons. 

Their divorce was a 50/50 split of assets but dad has always said mum got the better deal, and that was the reason why give me first home deposit while mum gave me a 10% down payment in addition to my savings.

I also know that he has recently remarried with his coworker (heard this from other family friends), but he has denied that. He has also lied about not having money for a certain expense for about $1500 and asked me to pay out of pocket for it. I have kind of expected to not receive any inheritance from him. I have tried telling myself that I am doing this for family and shouldn’t expect things in return. But I have definitely not been prioritizing his things in terms of my actions.

176,1dhs5xj,AITA for denying to pay for my in laws and expecting my brother in law to take up responsibility? ,"
Hey guys so very briefly: I am from a country where we send money to our parents to provide for themselves once we start earning. It's a part of our culture and this post has got nothing to do with this. 

My husband recently quit his job because it was horribly draining, however he doesn't have an offer from anywhere else yet. He would regularly send his parents money and my brother in law sends half of that (and the reason my husband gave me is that he is younger and gets a lesser pay than us).

However, now that my husband cannot send money until he gets a job, he asked me to pay for the few months. 

I said NO and said for years years his younger brother has gotten away by paying less and now he and his wife is expecting a baby so the new excuse is that they have to save. Also they both apparently don't earn as much as I do ( I am 6 years younger but I work hard!) and hence I should take this responsibility. 

I really hate this and although I would not have a problem supporting my in laws if my husband was an only child but that is not the case here. Additionally my brother in law's wife comes from family money and I should expect that although she is earning less, should in fact step up here. 

Please don't be harsh in the comments because this is a real issue. I love my husband very much and have a good relationship with my in laws but I am very annoyed at all the excuses my husband finds for his brother and wife in order to escape financial responsibility.

While at the funeral home picking out jewelry that could contain his ashes, my sister requested that my mom get one for her fiancé (M32), let’s call him John, while he was in the room. My mother hesitantly agreed if he wanted one as she was put on the spot, & my sister asked him and he said no it’s okay, but she pushed and said no he’ll get one. 

Later on in private I voiced to my mom my request to not allow this as I was uncomfortable with it. My reasoning is because John and my sister treat my parents like cash cows. When my parents could not assist as much in paying for their wedding, for legitimate circumstances such as medical bills and other financial burdens, they began to ignore us and when they were around they acted all mad. John had also sent a huge guilt trip text to my dad while he was in the hospital fighting for his life against cancer, saying my dad had promised all this money, when he in fact did not. 

Later on, they requested to move in with us as their current place they rented was being sold soon. My parents tried to find a solution but ultimately could not due to certain circumstances involving my dad’s health and their cats, as well as past history of my sister treating my parents like a hotel. My sister then tried to guilt trip my grandma, saying they were going to be homeless. Of course, this was not the true case as they now live in a nice apartment. Thus, my father and John were not close, only friendly. Plus, my sister and John have not even been dating for a year, we have not known him but for a few months. 

I am extremely uncomfortable with the idea of John having my father’s ashes with everything that has taken place. Additionally, these necklaces are expensive and we could use the money towards the extensive medical debt we have. I love my sister despite the troubles we have had over the years, and my mom agrees with me about the necklace, but she is worried that it will hurt my sisters feelings and that she will be mad at us.

they said i could do that but they also wanted me to marry. i said no again and they both got real mad. there was some yelling and i went to my room. i snuck out the window and ran to the library before calling my aunt, who's always on my side and kind of the black sheep of the family.

i feel like he is invalidating my feelings. constantly comparing me to my sisters and just random stangers off the street saying i shouldnt be depressed because i have it better then them which causes me to spiral into a deeper depression im juggling catching up on a whole year's worth of school while dealing with negative comments from him. i have tried to explain how i feel many times but he is uncomfortable so he refuses to listen

my therapist mention another person just had to make a rule that said person and one of their parents could never talk, i asked my mom if i could try doing that with my dad for a few days. her response was ""no, its not fair to your dad"". i just feel its also not fair to me because my mental state has to get worse because something isnt fair for my dad, i might just be selfish and stuck up, but i wanna know an outsider's opinion. sorry for the bad grammar and spelling mistakes i am just very tired. am i in the wrong?",,0.011022786609828472,0,0

At the beginning of college I was in a terrible long distance relationship on the brink of ruin and became friends with the boyfriend(they weren’t dating at the time). We instantly became close and both of us felt a connection. We flirted and stuff but nothing happened because I was in a relationship. I then introduced him to by best friend and they started dating each other after a couple of months. They’ve been dating for exactly a year now and everything seemed to be fine. The past year, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend and my best friend and the boyfriend really supported me through the breakup. 
I really ship them a lot but sometimes I let my mind wonder to what would have happened if I was single when I met him at the beginning of college. Me and the boyfriend and all our friends including my best friend have all agreed that me and the boyfriend are very similar and gell well but that’s all. Here’s where the sus stuff starts. Past couple of months me and the boyfriend have been getting very close where we talk all the time, sometimes about my best friend too, and when he gets drunk he calls me or cuddles me in front of my best friend (I obviously push him away and feel terrible but give him the benefit of the doubt and tell myself he was drunk). The past month has been insanely weird where he constantly talks to me and when our friend group went to a club recently, he took me aside and rambled about how much he admires and appreciates me and cares about me.

I'm not doing anything bad, you can't inhibit me or taking out my freedom to pray"" and she's right.

188,1dhr1nc,AITA for telling my fiancé that I don’t want her parents dog in my house?,"
I (24m) just bought a house that my fiancé (24f) and I will be living in. It is our house to live in together, but FWIW, I paid for 100% of the down payment and will pay the mortgage while she focuses on her student loans. Only my name is on the deed… 

Anyways, her family has a dog that they love and adore and treat like part of the family. I think that (like most dog owners) they do not see how gross and annoying their dog is to others, but whatever, they can do what they want in their house and life. Not my business. 

Today, they came and checked out the new house for the first time, and the dog ran around so excited (in my head, probably scratching the nice hardwood floors) and took a poop inside on the floor because “he was so excited”. Sigh…

I told my girlfriend that I don’t want her family dog or any other dogs in the house because I do not like dogs and find them disgusting, and that the dogs can just stay outside in our fenced yard. 

She was so offended and said that the dog is like part of the family and that her parents probably wouldn’t want to come over as much because they can’t leave their dog at home for extended periods of time. 

I think this is ridiculous and she’s not respecting my wishes. She got so offended I even brought it up. I also hate to say “my house”, but considering I put six figures of my own money down on this house, and am making the mortgage payments…

189,1dhr0bp,AITA for Not Wanting My Husband to Bring His Friend on Our Anniversary Trip?,"Hi everyone,

I'm feeling really conflicted and need some outside perspective.

My (32F) husband, Mark (34M), and I have been married for 8 years. We have two beautiful kids, ages 5 and 3, and a generally happy marriage. For our 8th anniversary, we planned a romantic getaway to a cozy cabin in the mountains. We've been looking forward to this trip for months as a way to reconnect and spend quality time together without the kids. Our relationship has had its ups and downs, and we both agreed that this trip would be a great way to rekindle our bond.

A few days ago, Mark told me that his best friend, Dave (34M), is going through a rough patch—he recently broke up with his girlfriend of four years and is feeling pretty down. Mark suggested that we invite Dave to come along on our trip to cheer him up.

I was taken aback and immediately expressed my concerns. I explained to Mark that this trip was meant to be a romantic getaway for just the two of us, and having Dave along would change the entire dynamic. I feel for Dave and want to support him, but I don't think our anniversary trip is the right time or place for that.

Mark got upset and said that I'm being selfish and not understanding how much Dave needs support right now. He thinks it would be a good distraction for Dave and that we can still have our romantic time together while including Dave in some activities. When I stood my ground, Mark's frustration escalated. He raised his voice and called me names, something he sometimes does when he's angry. It's one of the things I've learned to live with over the years, even though it makes me feel small and upset.

To give a bit more context, Mark has always had a bit of a temper. It usually flares up when things don't go his way, and he's prone to saying hurtful things in the heat of the moment. Over time, I've tried to avoid conflict by agreeing with him on most things, but this time, it felt important to stand my ground.

I've tried suggesting that we could plan another trip with Dave or spend time with him when we get back. I even offered to have Dave over for a weekend at our house so Mark could support him more closely. However, Mark insists that this is the best way to help his friend and that I'm being unreasonable.

Now I'm torn. I don't want to be unsupportive or selfish, but I also feel like our anniversary trip should be just for us. Am I the asshole for not wanting Dave to come on our anniversary trip?

Thanks in advance for your help.

190,1dhqzn3,AITA leaving niece birthday partner after being ignored by the hosts,"i need a reality check

so the following happened last weekend and i want to know if i am the asshole.

it was my nieces birthday (upper single digit)and we (wife, younger son and i) arrived half a hour after the beginning, which was communicated and no problem. after letting my wife and son out of the car i went to fetch our older son from (same age as niece) from his sport activity. we arrive their approx 20min after letting my wife out.

the oldest jump right into the kids party and i went to the table were every adult was sitting. i realize there is no plate set for me, weird. so i went past the table into the kitchen looking if they had them there buffet style. nope non. since my wife realized i have no plate she gives me her used one, while full on display in front of SIL and her husband (the hosts). i mean, i have no qualm using my wifes plate or use her fork, but this somehow triggered me a little. i resolved myself to finger food that was still on the table, since dinner would be 2 hours later. 

10 mins after i arrive they clear the table, including the cakes, plates and finger food. nice. no more food for me i guess. 30 mins later some in laws of the hosts arrived. they immediately get asked what they want for as drink and get a new set of plates and the cakes where brought back for them. by this point i had neither food nor a drink nor anything. 

so i just got up gave my wife a kiss said goodbye to her and went home to make me some food. i went over 4 hours later to get the youngest since he was tired and told my wife on arriving there, that i am pissed at the difference in hospitality and what she has to say about it. she said i could have spoken up, my stance is, that if i am an invited guest i dont beg to be getting food or something to drink, since everyone else get the same without asking. i was sitting next to SIL, so no excuse.

so aita for just leaving or justified. i know my SIL and her husband are terrible hosts but this took the cake so far, and its not the first time some ended at the short end of the stick. last bbq they had not enough meat for all ppl for example.

We went there individually, she with her car and me with the train and just before the end, I said I would leave because I was feeling sleepy. She said, let's leave together. She suggested to take a walk. I thought ok, I could push though for a few minutes. Then she said to sit for a drink, I refused saying again that I was sleepy. Then we arranged we would walk to her car and she would drop me off to the train station on her way home. I drifted off in the car and we stopped. I woke up and she said ""I stopped to have a smoke"". I said I am stressing about the time (the trains stop for the night and it was close to last train time). But thought ok, we do have 10mins. 

She started to rant about work and how her company may soon run out of business. At some point it felt like a long time. I silently decided that for such a serious matter I didn't want to interrupt shouting we won't make my train. After 50mins she was over and we realized there is no train service. Also I had stupidly forgotten my wallet home, so taxi was not an option. Walking was a no go too due to safety. She said ""ok, I ll drive you home"". After a minute we drive by the night bus station, see the bus will arrive in 35 mins (meaning I could be home in an hour) and she asked me to go take the bus. I said ""it is your call, but I would have preferred to take the train home to begin with"".

 IMPORTANT DETAILS: 

1.We were 3.5km(=2.1miles) away from my home. Had she given me a lift, it would have taken her 10mins extra to drop me off and come back.

2.Night bus runs every 1.5 hours and it might be so crowded you can't fit in and have to wait for the next one.

3.I suffer from insomnia from time to time. This means in the evening I suddenly get very sleepy and have little time until I fall asleep wherever I am. I have fallen asleep in the bus before, missing my stop. She knows about it, but I haven't mentioned that lately I am in the troubled phase.

4.She has a bad sense of orientation, I bet she wasn't aware how close we were to my home. At the time it didn't occur to me to explicitly mention it.

If I were in the place of my friend, I would drive the other one home, no matter what, 3.5km are not worth mentioning. This made me question if I am at a relationship of mutual respect. She says it was my responsibility to communicate my needs. The thing is I did. 4 times! If she expects me to throw a tantrum to get heard, then she needs a different person than I am.

On the other hand, it is not ok to take things for granted, noone owes us anything after all. I feel like an asshole for expecting her to help me out.

Recently, we were trying to conceive a child, and after many tests and tracking my ovulation cycle, we got pregnant. Unfortunately, when I was 20 weeks pregnant, we found out that our baby died by a nuchal cord incident in the womb. We were utterly destroyed. It was honestly the worst thing we have ever gone through. Birthing our dead daughter was the most heartbreaking thing we ever went through. During our grief, my parents came up to our house to drop some old keepsakes off and my mother said to me, ""I know you're going through a lot right now, but you have no idea what it does to the grandparents when their future grandchild was lost."" I'm sorry? I'm the one who had to birth my dead daughter while hearing other alive babies being born down the hall. I think being the mother of the situation is worse than being the grandparent. Plus, don't say that to the people who are currently grieving the loss of their child.

My mother was recently diagnosed with stage 4 COPD, a lung disease caused by her excessive chain smoking. I'm no expert by any means of the condition, but she apparently needs a lung transplant, and has been given 1 year life expectancy if she doesn't get one in the near future. This has significantly hindered her life and she is definitely pulling the martyr card any chance she gets. Normally, I feel like I should be devestated with the news, but I honestly feel nothing from her diagnosis. I don't know if it's me disassociating from my past trauma from her or if I've grown to just not care about her anymore. 

My husband and I now have a healthy baby boy that we are so grateful to have in our lives. He's a happy, sweet baby that has brought us a tremendous amount of happiness and fulfillment. 

Now my mother wants to be a non-abusive role model. My mother never made time for me as a child, never taking me to parks, science club, basketball practice, etc., but now she won't stop going on about how she's going to take him to amusement parks, bike rides, playgrounds, etc. This is everything she never did with me as a child even though I begged. I'm not jealous that she wants to do this with our child, it just hurts that she cares more about our baby than she ever did me.

Should we allow more visitation/babysitting for my parents, and risk letting my child endure similar trauma that I did as a child or should I protect our son and limit visitation in the future? As it stands right now, they want us to drive 1.5 hours there once a month so they can see the baby, even though he cries in the carseat almost the whole way.

196,1dhq9ik,AITA for cancelling on my friend becuase my boyfriend wanted me to? ,"I (20f) have a boyfriend Dean (19m) and a friend Aubrey (28f). I've been dating my boyfriend for about two years and have been friends with Aubrey for 6 years. I met both of them online and only met up with Aubrey a handfull of times in person, but we don't really live to far from each other. 

Dean didn't like Aubrey from before they met and I was worried Aubry wouldn't like Dean. They have very diffrent personalities and communicate differntly. Both are sweethearts but it takes longer to know that about Dean. They breifly met once and they didn't hate each other but they didn't hit it off. 

I had made plans to meet up with Aubrey for dinner in a week from when I'm postng this. I told Dean about this who didn't like that but didn't say anything. The next day he asked if I could go with him to his dad's for his birthday. His dad's birthday isn't on that exact day but Dean isn't always able to see him on some days. I figured that was reasonable, it is a birthday dinner so I agreed. I texted Aubrey asking if we could rescedule and she was ok with that. 

A few days later, Aubrey and I were calling and she asked why I resceduled- not upset just curious. I told her the truth about Dean's dad's birthday. Aubrey didn't like that answer. She thinks Dean is just using that to get us to not hang out as she knows he doesn't like her. She then went on about how she doesn't think he's trustworth and called out some things about him that happened long before we met even.

197,1dhq1rz,AITA for expressing to my friend I don’t want her ex at my wedding? ,"So I am getting married in mid 2025, and while planning for my wedding, have been kinda helping with my friend Jessyca and her complicated relationship. 

Anyways, Jessyca has been dating this guy, Stan. At first, it was going well and I expressed happiness for her relationship as she had been single for a while. But over time, the relationship had gotten more complicated. I used to have a habit of meddling in friends relationships but after going to therapy and working on myself, I’ve tried to stay out of it unless abuse is happening. 

A quick recap of their relationship: Jessyca and Stan have broken up about 3/4 times in a span of 4 months. First he cheated on her, but she begged him back. Got back together and broke up with her right before her birthday. He reached out and tried to be friends and she agreed, and didn’t tell anyone he asked her to get back together and she said yes. Well, that time, he broke up with her a week later after blocking her on everything as he’s going through a nasty divorce and “doesn’t need unnecessary stress”. She cried and begged him to not leave but he did, claiming it will be the last time they would see each other (he told her that last break up too). Basically it’s a revolving door of her waiting for him to come back and he does when it’s convenient for him idk. 

So I know I fucked up by telling her this a month after the breakup, but I told her I wasn’t comfortable with having him at my wedding given the history and hearing all the BS he did to her. I expressed that if she wants to be with him again after all that, whatever, it’s her life and choices and I’d accept it. 

She went off on me via email, saying I had no right to make such decisions for her, essentially forcing her to be dateless at my wedding (I never told her that, did suggest she could go solo), that I was condemning him and not letting him “redeem himself” if they were to get back together. She also stated that she didn’t want to be dateless and it wasn’t fair since I don’t feel comfortable meeting strangers right off the bat but I told her exceptions would be made in this case. She expressed she still has hope he’ll come back and he just “needs to get over his shit” 

Originally I read the email and didn’t register how mean it was towards me until my fiance commented on the language and accusing me of something I never said/implied. I sent a text asking for space, defending myself from the accusations and that it was such a far jump to say “I’m forcing her to be dateless” because her ex isn’t invited. I ended it by saying I’m done with this situation and I have nothing else to say about the topic. She replied, saying she was surprised by my message and she also wrote something “long” about the situation. Like what else is there to say? 

Anyways, I know I’m an asshole for making that comment way too soon, but given the background, am I the asshole for setting that boundary incase he does come back, that both my fiancé and I don’t want him there?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for expressing to my friend I don’t want her ex at my wedding?

198,1dhpvkt,AITA for taking back my dog because i dont like how she was treated.,"AITA, so I 25m had a small long haired fluffy dog and got her while I was still living with my brother (22M). He later got another dog and he become instant friends with mine. 
We continued to live together for a few years and that means the dogs grew a strong bond. Then my brother got his own place and moved out. 

We decided that it would be cruel to seperate the dogs at this point and as much as it broke my heart he took both dogs with him. This wasnt a decision made lightly but at the time he was in a better position to give the dogs the attention they deserved.

It has now been around two years and I recently had to home sit for my brother as he went on a work trip. During this time I observed things he had put in place that upset me. Firstly my dog was matted (this was not an issue with his dog as he was short haired) and had a dirty smell to her. Al fixed with about four baths and alot of brushing and grooming.

The other thing that had upset me is my dog had a shock collar on to stop barking. Now as a puppy she was trained put of excessive barking but as she has gotten older this has started to become a problem. I understand that this can be annoying and stressful but have never agreed with shock collars believing they are cruel. 
After witnessing this i decided that when my brother came home I would tell him I was taking my dog back as I wasnt happy with the way he was treating her. She has been back with me for about a month now and is amazing. 

The thing that makes me feel like TA  is that he keeps messaging me saying how upset his dog has become after separating them. I have also had some of his buddies message me telling me iman arsehole taking his dog after I abandoned her before and let him have her.

After this she went into a rant about how I’m entitled, how I expect things from people I don’t have a relationship with (I can be ta on that point I do ask for rides to work from time to time , I mostly lyft), and how I make things uncomfortable by not speaking to him. And how he’s my step dad so he should at least have that. I don’t view him as my father I call him by him first name.

201,1dhpsjw,AITA for insisting my dad washes his hands in his own home?,"My dad is a great person. He’s compassionate, intelligent, has a good sense of humor, and always takes care of me and my siblings. We don’t ask him for much, but he gives us everything and more. I feel very lucky to have a dad like him.

I stop by my parent’s house daily. I live close by and they are kind enough to let me leave my dog with them while I work. It’s a huge benefit to me because otherwise I’d be running home to let them out on my lunch break or I would pay a lot of money for a sitter or daycare (which I have done in the past before I moved closer). 

I say this for two reasons. 1 is to say that I visit them twice a day, 5 days a week - sometimes 6. We like to spend time together and both my parents try to convince me to stay the night often or to stay for a drink (and I do take them up on it often).

The other reason is that I spend a lot of time here and I can’t help but notice my dad’s habits that can really gross me out. They have a bathroom close to the living room and I can’t help but notice the toilet will flush and he’ll walk right out without washing his hands. Often he’s still even buttoning up or tying his sweatpants.

Germs and bacteria do gross me out and it has become somewhat worse since the pandemic. I do work with children and I know they are pretty gross too so I can live with it and wash my own hands often to keep clean since I know many others simply don’t. With this being said, I can’t stand when my dad leaves the bathroom without washing or picks at his nose and then touches things.

What has prompted this AITA post is that my dad gets upset and says that I police him in his own home. He has even started to run the water and swish his fingers under so that I leave him alone about it. But when I hear the water run for 3 seconds right after a flush I can make an educated guess that soap wasn’t used since it would take longer to wash off.

Today we were playing a card game and he was eating cherries. He kept spitting out the pits into his hand and placing them on the table. I couldn’t take it and so I got him a small bowl for the pits and asked him if he could wash or sanitize his hands before we continued playing. He started laughing at me and saying that I was so uptight and even said “okay I’ll do it to calm you down since I know how you get”. I promise I never yell but I am visibly grossed out and will laugh telling him even children know to wash their hands.

So AITA for expecting him to wash his hands and insisting on it, even in his own home? I get if he never had company and wanted to live in his own filth but he has plenty of guests besides me often. I think they’d be disgusted if they knew. Also, we all went through Covid I think this is pretty reasonable.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-17,"AITA for insisting my dad washes his hands in his own home?

202,1dhpgug,AITA for secretly swapping out my mom's bridesmaid dress? ,"My mom bought a bridesmaid dress online for her friend's upcoming wedding. She would typically wear an XL but when it came in, it didn't fit her.  She has a ton of body issues (not her fault, my grandma was awful to her), and I don't like to see her get so down on herself. The dress not fitting was really a problem with the shape of the dress vs my mom's body shape.  She's an apple shape with a wide rib cage, and this dress has an empire waist that is weirdly tight at the waist, cut well for an hourglass or pear shape, but it wouldn't zip for my mom.  

She asked me if I could let the dress out to fit her, and I told her I'd work on it (I sew). I ended up ordering another of the exact same dress to fit her measurements but I had to go up to like a 5x to get one with a waist that would fit her rib cage.  I knew she'd be mortified, even if it's just a subjective size, so I swapped the tags inside the dress and told her that I contacted the company and they'd mislabeled her first dress as an XL by accident and had sent her the correct XL dress.  Obviously the 5x fit her ribs like a glove and then I was able to take in the bust and shoulders to fit her really well, and added flutter sleeves (it was sleeveless and they made her more comfortable). 

She loves the dress now and happily believes that it's an XL, but my sister found out what I did when she found the original dress in my closet.  (I couldn't return it because I took the size tag out). She wheedled the story out of me and she's furious with me for it.  

She's saying that lying to my mom does her no favors and indulges her body image issues instead of convincing her to own them. She's saying I robbed her of a chance to see how size is just a subjective number and now she's going to be mortified if she figures it out and twice as humiliated if she realizes I hid the truth. My sister is threatening to tell her. She yelled at me that I'm not allowed to say what mom's ready for. She's says I've got no business protecting mom from reality.  

I feel like my sister is acting really triggered but I don't know why, and I don't see what's so bad about considering my mom's feelings. 

Please tell me if I'm not seeing this clearly and if my sister is right, because maybe she is, but I feel like she's just being weird. I finally got her to agree not to tell mom until after the wedding, but I'm not sure I trust her.  

For clarification: this is my older sister, 7 years older than me. I'm 34, mom is 60. We also have a little brother. I've struggled with my size my whole  life and recently lost a lot of weight so I feel like I understand how my mom feels more than my sister does because she's been rail thin her whole life. I'm also closer to my mom and know how badly she'll overreact.

She doesn’t often get out of the house but when she did at my old house my neighbors were very kind about it and/or didn’t mind. Some even helped me retrieve my dog and were very kind. Recently my dog got out of our new house. I immediately ran out to get her without shoes on. She eventually got into a neighbors (2 houses down) yard. They were outside with two children maybe 4-7. She ran up to them used to people being kind and happy to see her. The one girl got scared and screamed her mom then picked her up and swooped her away. I was about to apologize when a man (I’m assuming their dad) screamed at me “get your effing dog out of my yard!” Expect he cursed. I understand they may have been startled and shouted and that the girl got scared. I said sorry softly under my breath and went to get my dog. She ran up to the other adults and they all shooed her away making it more difficult for me to get her. Once we got her and my back was turned to them I began bawling. I’ve never had such a rude interaction even in school! 
Not to mention he was a grown man yelling at me and I was already flustered from trying to get my dog . I told my mom what happened and she stormed over. These people cursed her out infront of their kids and even threatened my dog. They also yelled at her for stupid things unrelated to the situation. I truly feel bad for scaring their kids but I still think the neighbors are the aholes what do you think? ",Asshole,2024-06-17,"AITA for my dog scaring the neighbors kids?

205,1dhp2ob,AITA for not helping my mom open our pool?,"I (16f) live with my mom (46f) and dad (67m). For the context of this post, all you need to know is that we have an in-ground pool in our backyard. We use a solar cover that absorbs the sun’s rays to make the pool water warmer.

Now onto the story.

So I was sitting outside on our back porch doing stuff on my phone. I was playing with our dogs in the backyard and decided to stay out a little longer to enjoy the nice weather. I always do that. I don’t do it to avoid my family, I just like the solidarity of being outside.

When I decide to go inside, I open the door and am surprised to see my mother walking towards the door to go outside. I didn’t see her because I was looking at my phone when I opened the door. 

She goes outside and does some stuff while I sit down and keep doing things on my phone. Suddenly, she comes back inside pretty angry. She’s pissed off because she thinks I went inside knowing she was going outside to open the pool. Keep in mind, not only did I not see her going outside, she also never told me that she was going to open the pool.

She was staying stuff like “I am so tired of having a child who doesn’t take any initiative to help me. No “Can I water the plants for you, Mom?” or “Do you want me to open the pool so that you can relax?” What a spoiled brat. I’m sick of this.”

Now here’s where I might be the asshole. I don’t really ask her if she ever needs help. I used to, but she’d always tell me no, and I’d walk off. She’s one of those people who wants to do everything but then gets mad when she’s the one doing everything. Because of this, I usually just wait for her to ask if she needs help, but she wants me to ask her if she needs help.

The thing is, I would’ve helped her if she just told me that she wanted to open the pool. But she never did. And now she thinks that I deliberately went inside just so that I wouldn’t have to help her. I didn’t know she even wanted to open the pool.

I would tell her all that, but then she’ll just go off on her “No initiative” rant again and will tell me to not “tell her how to parent”. She did that the last time I told her we need better communication and that yelling at me and calling me names isn’t the way to do that. She doesn’t want to be told how to do things, because as she says, “Mom knows everything”. If I am to tell her anything, it would have to be in the form of an apology. I want to tell her how I feel, but she’ll just yell at me for telling her how to parent and how she was never disobedient to her parents and how much harder she had it back then.

So Reddit, I turn the judgment over to you. AITA?

**Update:** So I just got yelled at. I recorded the scenario and it lasted for a little less than half an hour. 

She was yelling at me because I have no sense of responsibility and whenever I would try to tell her my side of the story, she would tell me to either not raise my voice at her or twist what I’m saying into a completely different message. 

I was telling her that I wait to be asked for help, that I can’t read her mind. Then she started saying “So you want me to do everything for you? Just hold my tongue and let you be lazy and self centered?” She said that I have to watch her every time she goes to do something and I repeat back to her “So you want me to watch you all day?” and she shoots back “Did I say that?? I just said to watch whenever I do something so that you can ask if I need help.”

I don’t think I can post the recording on here, but at one point in the argument, she was asking why I never asked to learn how to clean the stove. I kept trying to point out to her that what would happen is that I’d learn, then try to clean the stove, and then get told I’m doing it wrong just so mom could do it. But every time I tried to tell her that, she would interrupt with “Why didn’t you ask to learn?” She interrupted me with that question 2-3 times before I just gave up.

Now she’s already convinced that I just want her to do everything for me when all I want is for her to just tell me when she needs help.

And now I’m crying on my bed. She really likes to yell at me before I go to bed for some reason and it always ends like this. I hate it.

My mind is currently repeating “Well, at least she won’t have to yell at you for being selfish once you leave for college” and it makes me upset because why is it that thinking of my freedom make me think things like that?

208,1dhnwxm,AITA for telling my mom I can’t trust her?,"Earlier today I(21f) had an argument with my mom which led to me telling her I couldn't trust her, which she called rude and an overreaction.

For years, my mom has had this bad habit of secretly donating our clothes without telling us. Sometimes it was stuff she thought was too small for us, but most of the time it was just clothes she didn't like or didn't want us to wear anymore.

For example, I really like professional wrestling and have received many t shirts of my favorite wrestlers as gifts over the years, yet the only one I still have is from this past November. My mom doesn't understand why I like wrestling, probably because I'm a girl, and even when I've tried to ask where my merch has gone she's always shooed me off.

The donation bag would always be in her closet, so if I noticed I was missing an item of clothing odds are it would be in the donation bag. Since as early as middle school, when I started noticing that she would take my clothes, I always asked her to please check with me before donating any of my clothes.

Of course she didn't, and continued picking things out of the laundry or even go so far as going into my drawers and closet to take things. A few months ago I found a really nice dress of mine that I bought in the donation bag and I blew up, screaming and begging her to ask me anytime she would donate clothes. This seemed to get to her, as she stopped taking things until earlier today.

In the car with her today I looked in the backseat and noticed the donation bag, but peeking out was the arm of a sweater I had literally bought last week. I grabbed the bag and noticed my last remaining wrestling t shirt, about 5 pairs of my socks, and even some bowls and plates I had bought for my apartment next year. 

We began arguing, with her not giving me a clear reason why those were in the donation bag, and I told her that because she went back on her word I couldn't trust her anymore.

209,1dhnnqv,AITA for no longer calling my grandfather after he said I talk too much?,"Random throwaway account.  I come from a very old school Italian family.  Men are at the top, they do the speaking and are dominant.  I was raised in the United States and “think I’m a man”.  I am unapologetically loud and boisterous, make my opinions known, and don’t let anyone in my family belittle me just because I am a woman.  My grandfather has always liked that about me, he loved how spicy I was and my sense of humor.  
I don’t know if he is getting more conservative with age, but lately he has been making comments that I talk too much, even though I know I do not talk half as much as my father and uncles do.  They will literally dominate the conversation and I’m used to them telling me I talk to much because they say that as a way to just dismiss me when they want to have a man talk and get annoyed that I am voicing my opinions when all the other women are silent. 
Today he said something that really shocked me.  We were talking about a massive win I have at my job and how proud I was of myself.  I saw him making the hand gestures that I was talking too much, which was very surprising because I had just started describing the win.  When I saw him making those motions with his hands I stopped talking and stared at him, and everyone turned to look at him.  He said “you should have been a lawyer, people would leave the room just to stop listening to you”.  I just laughed at him and kept talking, but after thinking about it, I don’t know why I should continue to go out of my way to call him every week.  He is literally estranged from many of my aunts and uncles because of his behavior but has never been cold to me as of lately.
I know if I tell my family they’ll tell me I’m being petty and I guess I am.  But to me if he thinks I talk too much and people would leave the room to not have to hear me, why would I go out of my way to call him and chat with him? 

Edit to clarify that I will still see him a lot but I call him on a weekly basis and he seems to always enjoy my chat.  As of the past couple of months he’s been making side comments about me talking too much more frequently but never says things like that to me when it’s just us.

210,1dhnifx,AITA For not moving my car,"Info: I(19F) am living with my grandparents in a small gated community. They have an overflow of visitors, so to accommodate for parking, they have community spots. Every few houses there are spots lined with red bricks to identify them as community spots. That said, anyone can park in them, not just visitors.

Today when I arrived home, I noticed that my usual spot was already occupied, so I drove a few houses down to the next community spot. The owner of the house closest to the spot I was in was waiting to confront me. This woman and I had previous issues over me parking here, but never had been uncivil. Right off the bat, she had a very negative tone to her. She asked if I was parking there all night, and I responded with ""Yes ma'am"", trying to be respectful. She asked why I couldn't park anywhere else. I told her the lots were either full or too far away. She told me I can't park there, because it was her spot. I then pointed to the bricks lining the spot and told her it was for anyone who wanted to park here, and just because it was next to her house didn't make it her spot. She was getting pretty upset and started yelling. She told me to move, to which I said no. She then demanded that since I didn't live in the community, I couldn't park here. I told her I absolutely do live here, and even if I wasn't a resident, I had every right to park here. She said that if I live here, to park in my grandparents driveway. My grandmother's car was in the garage, and she woke up much earlier than I did. If I parked behind her, I would have to wake up around 5-6am, instead of my preferred 9am. While this is the case, I did not explain this to her and just flat out told her no. She doesn't need an explanation for me parking in a spot I am allowed to be in. She was livid at this. She said she would call the parking services and have a word with them about this situation. I told her to go for it, and see where that got her. Along with that, I told her she could try to tow my car if she so wanted to. The woman yelled that she would. I could tell this argument was getting us nowhere, and walked back to my house with her still yelling behind me.

I told my grandparents about what happened and they were pretty upset about her behavior. They had told me that while she was in the wrong, I shouldn't have gone out of my way to start conflict with her. I don't think I'm wrong just for parking near her house. The other option is to have a walk that's about twice as far. I will say either walk isn't far at all to get home, but one is more convenient (along with the fact it's in the shade at almost any time of the day). I do get that she really is just a bitter old lady who is going to argue just because she thinks she is entitled to what she deems as hers, but I don't think I should let myself be pushed around by her. Should I have just moved my car and left alone? I don't think I am wrong for standing up to myself here?

My grandmother's car was in the garage, and she woke up much earlier than I did. If I parked behind her, I would have to wake up around 5-6am, instead of my preferred 9am. While this is the case, I did not explain this to her and just flat out told her no. She doesn't need an explanation for me parking in a spot I am allowed to be in. She was livid at this. She said she would call the parking services and have a word with them about this situation. I told her to go for it, and see where that got her. Along with that, I told her she could try to tow my car if she so wanted to. The woman yelled that she would. I could tell this argument was getting us nowhere, and walked back to my house with her still yelling behind me.

I told my grandparents about what happened and they were pretty upset about her behavior. They had told me that while she was in the wrong, I shouldn't have gone out of my way to start conflict with her. I don't think I'm wrong just for parking near her house. The other option is to have a walk that's about twice as far. I will say either walk isn't far at all to get home, but one is more convenient (along with the fact it's in the shade at almost any time of the day). I do get that she really is just a bitter old lady who is going to argue just because she thinks she is entitled to what she deems as hers, but I don't think I should let myself be pushed around by her. Should I have just moved my car and left alone? I don't think I am wrong for standing up to myself here?

You look like your fucking dating”, After she said that Ryan sat up straight and I move off his shoulder and I said “Why did you say that so loud” and my mother yelled back “Well every waitress here thought you and him were fucking dating so I had to announce it” so I promptly said stfu.
