0,1dilhef,AITA for telling friends that my dad is a bigot,"For reference, I am trans girl and have been for 6 months, and I am under 18.

The reason I'm saying my dad is bigoted to friends is that he has shown racist and homophonic and transphobic views. In the past and present

Example for him being racist ->he has said  
""there animals"" and ""can they even be rehabilitated"" this was in reference to Africans moving to the us, he has said this stuff in the past 4 months and that's why I think he could be potentially racist

Examples of him being transphobic -> he does not support people under 18 medical transitioning even when evidence has been shown

 constantly saying I'm gay if I liked guys when I am a trans girl

 going strongly against MTF playing in women's sports

When I first came out, he went on a giant rant about how I will never be a girl and how the lgbtq community is like a cult, and there was a lot more to that

He has said to my little brother in private that he does not think I'm trans as recently to a month or 2 ago (my little brother is 9)

When I first started to use a fem voice (I don't now but not because of him) he got really weird about it and sat me down saying plenty of women have a deep voice so I don't need to use a fem voice about 4 months ago

Got really into the whole budlight thing and was on the side of the people boycotting budlight

When I dressed fem for the first time, he actively ran away from me about 4 months ago

And finally, he seems fine with me being a girl until I change litteraly anything besides pronouns and name

He uses the f slur semi regularly even after I told him he can't say it (he only uses it jokingly)

He supports Blaire White

This is the section in support of him not being bigoted

Examples ->he has said to me that he does support me (after the bigoted rant)

My mom constantly says that he supports me and how in private he uses my correct name and pronouns

He has promised to consider puberty blockers after a year

He is trying his hardest, according to my mom

He is fine with gay people and is now tolerant

He is ok with me having other trans and gay friends

He is not a dickhead to trans and gay and black people in public

He does respect my pronouns and name but slips up alot sense it's only been 6 months

Concluding statement I think I could be the asshole sense I'm saying all this to friends and to him a few times and I feel like I could be being a little harsh on him

1,1dihx87,AITA for refusing to visit my grandparent's place?,"Apologies for horrible pacing and grammar. So, me (16, AFAB) and my family are going on a break by travelling to another city. We're currently staying at my brother's place here and just arrived a day ago. 

We came back after spending time outside the house. Everyone is preparing to go to bed now. I'm in one of the bedrooms, sitting on the bed with my mom. She was in the same room because it's air-conditioned (outside isn't) and was cooling off. 

I was waiting for her to finish so i could prepare for bed. She asked me what date it is, then informed me that we'll be going to my grandparents place 1-2 days later for two nights so she could visit their graves. 

A fact is that I don't really know my grandparents well. They passed away when I was a young child, like toddler age I think? The only thing I remember is visiting their place and being scared of my grandma. And that's about it, the next thing I knew later on she passed away.

My grandparents place is in a rural area in another district that's neighbouring the one we're currently in, the place is in a small village in the middle of the woods. To get to there, people have to take a long drive through the forest on quite bumpy and uneven roads. Their place is simple, a wide wooden house with cement flooring. The bathrooms are seperate from the main house that have the bedrooms, living room, and kitchen. My extended family lives there but also in the surrounding area.

So, something about me is that, I do not do well with any change, big or small, especially sudden once. I get very stressed out that a change is happening, I'll stress about the transition from previous state to current state. 

For example, I had to prepare myself mentally and physically to go on this trip. I had to know what will happen during the time on the trip. Of course, I also had to pack clothes and necessities. I know that the main thing for why we're visiting here is to attend my brother's wedding to his fiancée and to just take a vacation (I'm on my school break). I did not know that we'll be going to visit our grandparents place. I had thought about it since last time we went there but they didn't tell about it before going here so I didn't thought about it again.

Not only that, I get motion sick during really long rides. And the worse/more bumpy the roads are, the worse my motion sickness gets. After long rides, when I lay down, I get dizzy and still feeling the motions from the travelling.

I didn't take it well. I said that I didn't want to go there. The last time I went, I had a meltdown since I was also not informed of it until last minute. I didn’t want to go so the same thing doesn't happen again. My mom then said that i was selfish, for always thinking about myself. She didn’t want me left by myself since she, my dad, my brother are all going (my 2nd brother isn't here yet and my bro's fiancée is leaving the city for work) and that no one is there to look out for me. She then left the room.

2,1difudw,AITA for telling my mom I did not want her there when I got home from deployment,"I (21M) have been deployed for the past 10 months and I will be getting home in 1 week. My wife and I’s plan was for her to be the only one to know what date I was coming back, so that when I get leave we can go back and surprise all of our family and friends. 

My wife (21F) visited home a couple weeks ago for a family event, and while she was there she spent a day with my mom and 2 younger sister (hs age). My mother is very pushy and hates surprises. So much so that me surprising her by coming home would make her mad at me. My wife and I knew we would eventually have to tell her because of this, but we’re waiting until the last minute because she would have told my sisters if she knew my date. Well, while my wife was there, my mom pushed and pushed. Telling her that she wouldn’t speak to her, let the girls go places, and she had to know so she could take days off work. My wife gave her a week range of my leave (a couple weeks after I get back) so that she could request off. 

Well, my mom texted me today Telling me that she would be here for the welcome home when our plane lands. I asked if she cleared this with my wife, seeing as she apparently planned to stay with us in our 1 bedroom apartment, and she said no. I asked if the girls knew and were coming, and she said no.

My mom has done a few things that presses between my wife and I, so I lost it on her. Told her I wouldn’t be giving her the date that I fly in, that if I wanted her there I would want my sisters there as well. I stopped there until she started complaining that she was a single mom who raised me on her own, and that I should want to see her first. That’s when I told her I didn’t want her in my house at all when I first get home. I am a married, grown man now, I don’t need my mom, I want to see and spend time with my wife first and foremost. She pressed further saying “I’ve been here for u since before u were born, she’s been here for 4 years.” Eventually trash talking my wife, saying she doesn’t even have a real job and doesn’t contribute. My wife is a nanny while she is in school, and she gets paid well, so she absolutely does contribute more than enough.

This is where I may be the asshole. I told my mom that I was tired of her badgering, that I wanted to come home to my wife and be alone in our home with our pets. My wife and I would not want to host her, and we wanted the house to ourselves so that we can have sex wherever and whenever we please because we haven’t seen each other in so long. 

My mom cried. She’s sending me long paragraph texts every few hours about how she doesn’t know where her caring son went, about how I need to let my wife go because I use her for her body, about how all I care about is my own pleasure, and I have no care for my family at all.

3,1dif6f4,AITA for letting my BF’s little cousins text him on my phone?,"My bf (26M) invited me (24F) to a family dinner at his grandparents’ apartment yesterday. He needed to help his dad install some ACs in his office, so he was not able to come with me to go there (his mom and uncle came to pick me up and drive me there). At his grandparents’ place, I say hello to his aunts and uncles and grandparents and then hang out with his 2 little cousins (one is 12 and the other is like 9 or 10) because everyone else is speaking Cantonese and I felt kind of awkward just sitting there not being able to understand anything. It’s been about 40 minutes and my bf still hasn’t arrived, so his cousins want me to call him and ask where he is. He says he’s still putting in the AC. About 10 minutes later, his cousins ask me if they can send him some texts and I say sure because I don’t want to be mean to some little kids and they were pretty polite about it. Over the course of the next 20 minutes, they send him 6 messages, all along the lines of “where are you, we miss you, please answer us, when are you coming” etc. as well as some stickers. Then, we eat dinner (still without him) and then have dessert and then he finally arrives about an hour later and he’s mad at me because I let his cousins text him on my phone. When I asked him why, he said that it was annoying to feel his phone buzzing while he was trying to put in the AC and that I shouldn’t have let them on my phone. I said sorry and that it wouldn’t happen again, but today he said that he was still mad about it. 

I feel like this is such a childish thing to be mad about - he’s 26 and mad about his own little cousins texting him? He could have just silenced his phone if it bothered him so much. And I’m also bothered that he blamed me for it and decided to “punish” me by saying that he wasn’t going to come over to see me later this week. What was I supposed to do? Tell them that I’m not going to let them text their cousin? And how was I to know that he’d be so bothered by this? I didn’t ask to be left for 2 hours alone with his extended family without him there and I would’ve much rather stayed home if I knew this was going to happen.

We are a childless couple and are not planning to have children anytime soon.

Up until recently we didn't have to worry about groceries as much cause it was just him and I at the house 90% of the time. Recently her and her boyfriend split so she's been home. She's a bit of a control freak when it comes to how she likes to clean and cook. So I took a step back, as it is her house and I don't like to step on toes.

Anyways. She insists on defrosting food on the counter every day, including shrimp, chicken, etc all in the same bowl defrosting on the counter. All. Day. I have explained to her multiple times how bad this is. Her ex husband and her used to fight about it all the time as he was a chef.

I have asked my boyfriend to ask her to stop. I refuse to eat her food and go hungry most nights for the last week. But I am paying for half of these groceries. Including $600 worth of meat she bought just a couple weeks ago. Keep in mind I'm beyond broke right now and have verbalized this and asked to stop spending excessive amounts on food. My request goes unnoticed.

A few days ago I messaged my boyfriend and told him if she does not stop doing this I refuse to pay for groceries and will buy my own food. I'm not paying for food that will make me sick so I'm not eating it anymore. Tonight she decided to do it again, so I refused to eat dinner with them.

UPDATE: Wasn't expecting so many people to chime in, thank you all. Everyone's opinions and comments helped.

He agreed, was quite worried and didn't realize his IBS was connected to eating food defrosted in dangerous temperatures.

I brought all of this up to my boyfriend, including about his health issues and IBS and how it is affecting both of us. I offered to start buying seperate groceries and making us seperate meals. He agreed, was quite worried and didn't realize his IBS was connected to eating food defrosted in dangerous temperatures. He had a conversation with her this morning about it and again today I found a whole chicken defrosting on the counter. I went grocery shopping and we will not be joining her for dinner unless she agrees to stop preparing food dangerously.",0.0,0.106588736,0,1
7,1diet7o,AITA for needing a break from my DND group to help my mental health?,"Hello, first time posting. Feeling very conflicted right now.

I (28f) have been a part of a dnd campaign for just under three years now. It's the best dnd campaign I've ever been in, with a group (party and players) that meshed excellently.

A little background: I'm in an unhealthy and possibly abusive home life. This isn't the place to talk about that, but it's starting to cause my mental health to tank to the point where my work is getting affected. I'm working to try to move out, but it's requiring a LOT of therapy and I've had no energy for anything. This has been quite literally one of the most difficult weeks of my life, and it's looking like it's just going to get harder over the next couple of months. And the entire group is aware of these issues, how much they're affecting me, and that I'm literally in the middle of a crisis.

Because of this, I knew that I wouldn't be able to put myself into a roleplaying headspace every week. I knew that it wouldn't be fair to our Dungeon Mistress or the players because I wouldn't be able to be the character that I know and love. So, I asked for a break. I told the DM that I wouldn't be able to play for a bit. I wasn't very specific, but in my mind, I was thinking maybe two months to try to get myself together and more functional again. She was understanding, and we had talked about the hope of bringing the campaign back once my life was a little bit more functional.

A lot of people in the campaign were very hurt, and I completely understood and thought it was valid to feel that way. I dropped a pretty major bomb on them all of a sudden. Anyway, today, they had a meeting without me, and I have been essentially voted off of the campaign. They said that this was ""a breach of trust"" and a breach of the commitment that we made to each other and our time and investment to each other. 

I'm feeling very conflicted about this, because I know it was rude of me to not consult the group about needing a break, but it feels very hurtful to be removed from a group that meant so much to me when they knew about how hard everything else in my life is.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for needing a break from my DND group to help my mental health?

I haven’t had a relationship with him since I was 13 when he no longer wanted to be apart of my life. Some back story - my mum met my step dad when I was 7 and ever since then he was my dad. 
I met my fiancé when I was 10 we have been together ever since we was 13 and then when we were 16 we welcomed our baby girl into the world even tho she wasn’t planned. The rest of our family’s congratulated us all except my bio dad. When we told everyone that we was engaged it never crossed my mind to tell him, somehow the news got back to him (probably by someone on that side of the family as I’m okay with them). He has been demanding to know when the wedding date is and what she should wear to walk to me down the aisle. I recently sent him a text saying “I don’t know why u would be walking me down the aisle when you are not even invited to my wedding, you haven’t had any involvement in my life for years and you didn’t even congratulate me when I had your granddaughter” - a lot of my family are thinking I should just suck it up for one day and let him walk me down the aisle. However, I believe that it is my day and I should be able to make a choice of who I want there. So AITA?

Info to add for some more information - My bio dad decided one day he didn’t want to be apart of my life : it was after a time I had to cancel going to his house bc I was extremely ill to the point I ended up in hospital for 3 weeks and even then he didn’t visit or ask how I was. After this I admit I didn’t reach out to him!! But I was the kid in this situation and I don’t think that a child should be reaching out to a grown adult to be in their lives a phone works both ways. - I tried for many months after to message him and try and come into contact with him but all of my attempts ended in failure so I gave up!! He choose to not be apart of my life. My stepdad on the other hand was always there for me, when I was in the hospital etc - he never once badmouthed anything my bio father was doing or saying.

9,1die7sk,WIBTA for asking my (26F) friend (28F) to pay my partner (25M) back for her travel fare?,"My friend (28F) came to visit me (26F) while my partner (25M) had to go away on a business trip. I am busy, and I needed help with my puppy during the couple days that I work. My partner offered to pay for my friends travel fare in exchange for this, which she agreed. I was excited, however, throughout her time with me its been a bit of a disaster.

My friend did not let me know that she has a fear of big animals. She knew ahead of time that my very young puppy was a big breed dog, but I do not think that she realized what a bigger puppy entails. For example, she went into the puppy area, and he barked at her to get her to play. She threw his toy a few times, but got angry that he barked at her excitedly to play more. She ran out of the room, saying he was aggressive, but all my dog did was bark at her to throw his toy again. Another example, I let her take my older, more polite dog on a walk while I worked with my puppy, and she got overwhelmed by him even though he was doing nothing but walking and sniffing.

Beyond that, she has not helped me at all. I am disabled, so the help would have been greatly appreciated, and was what was supposed to happen but has not. She said the entire time that she was ""on vacation,"" and only wanted to go out and do more touristy things. My partner paid for her food, stay, and other activities in exchange for her help, but it has not happened at all. She helped clean a few things, but I had to do a lot of cleaning up after her and my car.

Additionally, she made my friends extremely uncomfortable. She kept bringing up politics and grew angry when we did not want to talk about our political views. My friends and I like each other regardless of who we are voting for, but that answer was not enough for her.

Overall, I am extremely upset. We have been friends for a while but I do not know if that will continue. She talked about coming back here, and I do not know how to bring it up that I am unsure whether that's a good idea. I do not want someone who is scared of my dogs in my house overnight. Its stressful for me, my dogs, and I do not think its fair to lock them up all the time. So WIBTA for saying she is no longer allowed to stay here in the future and asking for the plane ticket money back?

Overall, we spent at least $1,000 while she was here with the promise she will help me when my partner leaves.

10,1die5nc,AITA for asking my friend not to bring her friends to my birthday dinner?,"About a month before my birthday, my best friend of 6 years (23F), who recently moved to a different city, texted me to ask if I would be in town for my birthday. I told her I'd be in town on my birthday (a Thursday), but I had a work trip early on Saturday and planned to celebrate my birthday the following weekend. She then told me that she and her boyfriend, who I've never met, were coming into town to see their favorite artist in concert on Friday, the day after my birthday.

She asked if we wanted to go to the show with them, but I declined due to my early work trip. She understood and suggested a birthday dinner on Thursday, to which I excitedly agreed. We planned a double date with her, her boyfriend, my partner, and me.

A week before my birthday, she confirmed their arrival and suggested making it a beach party. I preferred the double dinner date and told her so, as I had already coordinated a celebration with other friends for the following week. She agreed, saying she hoped for the same.

Four days before my birthday, she asked if her boyfriend's friend, who decided to come to the concert, could join us for dinner. I was annoyed because it was my birthday, and we had planned an intimate double date. However, I felt I couldn't say no, so I decided to change my plans and have a group dinner with close friends, including her and her boyfriend’s friend. I texted my other friends, secured a reservation for 10, and tried to get over my annoyance.

The next day, she asked if she could bring another person, a girl from SF joining their Airbnb for the concert, so she wouldn’t be alone on Thursday night. This request really bothered me. I had already changed my plans once and didn't want more strangers at my birthday dinner. I took a day to think and decided to be honest with her.

I texted back basically: I'm so excited to see you and meet your boyfriend. I haven't celebrated my birthday with friends for 3 years, and I was looking forward to an intimate dinner with my close friends. I'd love to have you and your boyfriend there, but I'm not thrilled about 2 strangers coming. I totally get if you need to hang with your concert friends on Thurs, and if so maybe we can do a separate dinner on Fri b4 the show. Lmk

She responded basically saying: Thanks for being honest. We really want to be there but have a responsibility to these two people. They’re staying with us and came to see us. We can’t abandon them. We also can’t do Friday because of the show. I understand it's not ideal for you. If you would have the four of us, I’d be grateful. If not, I understand. Just lmk.

This response upset me, because she even said, ""I didn't anticipate it being an issue for you."" I didn't expect her to invite strangers to my birthday dinner. AITA for feeling angry about this?

I told him he could but they weren’t mine and explained that my ex had left those behind. He got upset and wondered why I still had them here. I explained to him that the only reason I still had them is because I had talked to my exes sister(yes we’re still friends, we were friends before me and him even got together) and told her that I was going to toss them out or sell them since he hadn’t come to pick them up when I gave him the opportunity to, but she asked me to keep them so she could pick them up for him. For context me and my ex lived together for a short time and a couple months after we broke up I blocked him. I had told my bf all of this and he told me that he thought I was lying to him about the timing of the conversation I had with my exes sister. He continued by telling me what me having them there was disrespectful to him and that me “downplaying” (explaining) the situation was a red flag for him. He also told me that I’ve been disrespectful many times before 
Instance 1: 
I got a friend request on Facebook from an old co worker (male) I just ignored it and kept scrolling. Told me I was disrespectful for letting him sit in my requests (along with 20 other random people dating back months to years) I’m out of sight out of mind kind of person and didn’t think twice about it although I understood where he was coming from and cleared my requests as soon as he told me it bothered him

Instance 2: 
I had a security system installed and when the tech was showing me how to use the equipment he was making conversation with me, I kept it short as I wasn’t interested in having a conversation. I fake laughed at his unfunny comments and that was an issue. That I was interacting and laughing with the tech. 


He essentially told me that I’m a giant red flag and he’s unsure if he wants to end the relationship or not. At this point I’m so emotionally exhausted and don’t want to talk to him so I put my phone on dnd. I’m not sure if this relationship dies if I should fight for it or let him go.

12,1die1ak,AITA for not giving up a room we agreed was mine? ,"So I’m moving into a new shared flat for University with 4 of us (F) and we viewed the flat and decided we loved it.

So, a month ago (7th of May - we move in 20th of June), i took a look at the floor plan once we decided to go ahead and put our deposit down, and i noticed a room which was separated from the other 3 which is next to the kitchen (meaning didn’t share a wall with another bedroom).

I sent a message to my friends and said if they didn’t mind, i would like to have that room, purely just because i work online and lots of my friends play games together regularly online and if i was up late i would be concerned about noise for the others esp. during exam season and such.
In this message i expressed that if anyone else wanted it that was completely fine and we could think of a fairer way to do it. 
They all agreed there was no problem with me having it at all.

Now, a month later, 2 days before we move in, 2 of the girls expressed wanting to do the rooms by a hat draw, as they believed it was unfair to “claim” rooms, and someone would end up with the smaller one. they expressed they didn’t think about it when they agreed at the time and only just considered that hightens their chances of having that smaller room. (there is no size difference to my room, there are 3 medium and 1 slightly smaller).

for me, i responded saying i would’ve had no issue with this at the time but considering no issue was raised to me at the time and they all agreed, it should not be left to 2 days before for them to express this issue to me, and there is no fairer way than the way i did it, to ask directly and give the option of a randomised system if they so chose.

i feel it’s unfair for them to now go back on their agreement because they somehow didn’t think at the time it would effect them, i’ve been planning and thinking about this move for a long time and if they didn’t consider that at the time that’s bad planning on their part, and it shouldn’t now be me having to give that room back.

I was the only one who did all my chores because I wfh often, and even when I went in person, 5am to 9pm, I still managed to do my chores. She works 20hr/week and skips classes. 

Kacy would often yell at everyone in the chat about chores because the house was disgusting. There’s a lot of other personal behaviors that got to me (misogynistic comments about women, subtle digs at me bcs I didn’t look a certain way, calling herself “a kind hearted and generous person” after she tipped a salon person $8 for cutting her hair) I never brought up how she was the one who was forgetting her chores though because I wanted to be polite. I also did not want to go around personally reminding people to do their chores - the chore chart was in plain view. 

The month before we moved out, Kacy didn’t take out the trash for most of the week and there were maggots underneath the bags. The roommate before her, Chelsea (23f) didn’t take it out for most of the week too but she was out of town. 

Kacy started yelling in the GC, talking about how we need to be more responsible. I replied that it’s your turn (Chelsea, whose brain is fried, moved the magnets, messing up the order) Kacy was pissed but didn’t say anything. I complained to Mia (24f) secretly about Kacy not doing chores after Mia and I had argument in the GC that no one did their chores except me. I’d been avoiding Kacy for months due to her passive aggression atp. 

I took the trash out the next week, but the week after, Chelsea forgot. We were close to moving out and they stopped doing chores for a while. Then Kacy got on the group chat and started asking ""whose turn is it"" and no one replied.

Then she called ME out in the GC the next day. I said it's not my job to remind people but she kept insisting that it is our job to help each other - which is the part which makes me feel like an AH. Then she started going off and saying ""if you can talk shit about us not doing chores behind our backs then you can remind us"" (which is ridiculous, I very clearly expressed my frustration not once but twice in the group chat months ago) and went all ""SPEAK UP, stop being QUIET"" almost bullying me. We went back and forth several times but I stopped reading her messages because I was out and she has a habit of writing long messages that don't say anything. It feels like I am reading a middle schoolers writing. I snapped and asked her to stop talking and just said which roommates turn it is so she would stop texting. It left me feeling agitated because she was acting smug like she won the argument. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for not reminding my roommate to do her chores? I (25f) lived with three roommates. We drew up a chore chart a few months into moving in and had a meeting clearly explaining how the chores move around.

14,1didheu,AITA for “demanding” my partner to have dinner ready at a certain time? ,"My partner (33m) and I (33f) were listening to a podcast reading an AITH post about a guy complaining that his girlfriend made his coffee too hot and asked her to wake up even earlier before work so it could cool down for him. We were discussing this and it evolved into me wondering if I’m an asshole for the following situation: my partner and I both work full time. He’s a plumber and I work from home. He actually really loves cooking (and has gone to school for it) and I enjoy cleaning more when it comes to household tasks. He hates cleaning and I hate cooking so it works out. Because of his job and the fact he has to get up at 5am we tend to go to bed pretty early (9pm). I have asked him to generally have dinner ready at 7 so we have enough time to eat and for me to clean up after, and not have that be rushed right before bed time. Sometimes it’ll go later than planned and then I get frustrated by how late we’re eating and the fact that there are loads of dishes for me to do (we don’t have a dishwasher). He’ll get annoyed with me being visibly annoyed with him but he’s generally pretty okay with me asking to have it be done at a certain time. Am I an asshole for requesting this though and then getting frustrated when it’s not done? If it helps, we both have ADHD and so executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation play a big role here (as he struggles to get up and do things and I get stressed out by tasks and hunger as well). 
This isn’t an actual serious issue in our relationship but he joked about how I should post this and ask the internet their opinion (he’s jokingly called me a demanding 50’s husband before which I thought was hilarious).

15,1didh40,AITA for no longer wanting to talk to my family members after they told me my graduation is not a big deal?,"Hey everyone,

I need some outside opinions on a family situation that’s been really bothering me.

So my cousin recently got engaged, and her wedding is scheduled for august. She came over to my house to flaunt her engagement to my mom, which was a bit off since she never visits us when she's in town. Before they set the date, I specifically asked her and her fiance not to have the wedding on the day of my graduation. I'm graduating with a bachelor's degree in veterinary and biomedical science and I'm the first in my family to be on the path to becoming a doctor.

Despite my request, I found out from other family members that she planned her wedding for the same day anyway. She's even told people that "" I didn't have a graduation, so what huge deal is it really?"" and that her wedding is more important than my achievement. This really hurt me, and I expressed my frustration to my family. However, they think I'm making a huge deal out of it and said that graduations aren't as important as people make them seem.

To add to the frustration, these are the same family members who joke about getting free veterinary advice when I finally enter my profession. It feels like they're dismissing my hard work and achievements while still expecting to benefit from it in the future. this also comes from YEARS of being treated differently than my cousins and this made me rethink if ever want to be in a family setting ever again. I feel like my hard work and achievement are being completely overlooked, and I’m really upset. Am I overreacting here, or do I have a right to be mad about this?
