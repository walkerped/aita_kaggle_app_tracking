0,1dilhef,AITA for telling friends that my dad is a bigot,"For reference, I am trans girl and have been for 6 months, and I am under 18.

The reason I'm saying my dad is bigoted to friends is that he has shown racist and homophonic and transphobic views. In the past and present

Example for him being racist ->he has said  
""there animals"" and ""can they even be rehabilitated"" this was in reference to Africans moving to the us, he has said this stuff in the past 4 months and that's why I think he could be potentially racist

Examples of him being transphobic -> he does not support people under 18 medical transitioning even when evidence has been shown

 constantly saying I'm gay if I liked guys when I am a trans girl

 going strongly against MTF playing in women's sports

When I first came out, he went on a giant rant about how I will never be a girl and how the lgbtq community is like a cult, and there was a lot more to that

He has said to my little brother in private that he does not think I'm trans as recently to a month or 2 ago (my little brother is 9)

When I first started to use a fem voice (I don't now but not because of him) he got really weird about it and sat me down saying plenty of women have a deep voice so I don't need to use a fem voice about 4 months ago

Got really into the whole budlight thing and was on the side of the people boycotting budlight

When I dressed fem for the first time, he actively ran away from me about 4 months ago

And finally, he seems fine with me being a girl until I change litteraly anything besides pronouns and name

He uses the f slur semi regularly even after I told him he can't say it (he only uses it jokingly)

He supports Blaire White

This is the section in support of him not being bigoted

Examples ->he has said to me that he does support me (after the bigoted rant)

My mom constantly says that he supports me and how in private he uses my correct name and pronouns

He has promised to consider puberty blockers after a year

He is trying his hardest, according to my mom

He is fine with gay people and is now tolerant

He is ok with me having other trans and gay friends

He is not a dickhead to trans and gay and black people in public

He does respect my pronouns and name but slips up alot sense it's only been 6 months

Concluding statement I think I could be the asshole sense I'm saying all this to friends and to him a few times and I feel like I could be being a little harsh on him

1,1dihx87,AITA for refusing to visit my grandparent's place?,"Apologies for horrible pacing and grammar. So, me (16, AFAB) and my family are going on a break by travelling to another city. We're currently staying at my brother's place here and just arrived a day ago. 

We came back after spending time outside the house. Everyone is preparing to go to bed now. I'm in one of the bedrooms, sitting on the bed with my mom. She was in the same room because it's air-conditioned (outside isn't) and was cooling off. 

I was waiting for her to finish so i could prepare for bed. She asked me what date it is, then informed me that we'll be going to my grandparents place 1-2 days later for two nights so she could visit their graves. 

A fact is that I don't really know my grandparents well. They passed away when I was a young child, like toddler age I think? The only thing I remember is visiting their place and being scared of my grandma. And that's about it, the next thing I knew later on she passed away.

My grandparents place is in a rural area in another district that's neighbouring the one we're currently in, the place is in a small village in the middle of the woods. To get to there, people have to take a long drive through the forest on quite bumpy and uneven roads. Their place is simple, a wide wooden house with cement flooring. The bathrooms are seperate from the main house that have the bedrooms, living room, and kitchen. My extended family lives there but also in the surrounding area.

So, something about me is that, I do not do well with any change, big or small, especially sudden once. I get very stressed out that a change is happening, I'll stress about the transition from previous state to current state. 

For example, I had to prepare myself mentally and physically to go on this trip. I had to know what will happen during the time on the trip. Of course, I also had to pack clothes and necessities. I know that the main thing for why we're visiting here is to attend my brother's wedding to his fiancée and to just take a vacation (I'm on my school break). I did not know that we'll be going to visit our grandparents place. I had thought about it since last time we went there but they didn't tell about it before going here so I didn't thought about it again.

Not only that, I get motion sick during really long rides. And the worse/more bumpy the roads are, the worse my motion sickness gets. After long rides, when I lay down, I get dizzy and still feeling the motions from the travelling.

I didn't take it well. I said that I didn't want to go there. The last time I went, I had a meltdown since I was also not informed of it until last minute. I didn’t want to go so the same thing doesn't happen again. My mom then said that i was selfish, for always thinking about myself. She didn’t want me left by myself since she, my dad, my brother are all going (my 2nd brother isn't here yet and my bro's fiancée is leaving the city for work) and that no one is there to look out for me. She then left the room.

2,1difudw,AITA for telling my mom I did not want her there when I got home from deployment,"I (21M) have been deployed for the past 10 months and I will be getting home in 1 week. My wife and I’s plan was for her to be the only one to know what date I was coming back, so that when I get leave we can go back and surprise all of our family and friends. 

My wife (21F) visited home a couple weeks ago for a family event, and while she was there she spent a day with my mom and 2 younger sister (hs age). My mother is very pushy and hates surprises. So much so that me surprising her by coming home would make her mad at me. My wife and I knew we would eventually have to tell her because of this, but we’re waiting until the last minute because she would have told my sisters if she knew my date. Well, while my wife was there, my mom pushed and pushed. Telling her that she wouldn’t speak to her, let the girls go places, and she had to know so she could take days off work. My wife gave her a week range of my leave (a couple weeks after I get back) so that she could request off. 

Well, my mom texted me today Telling me that she would be here for the welcome home when our plane lands. I asked if she cleared this with my wife, seeing as she apparently planned to stay with us in our 1 bedroom apartment, and she said no. I asked if the girls knew and were coming, and she said no.

My mom has done a few things that presses between my wife and I, so I lost it on her. Told her I wouldn’t be giving her the date that I fly in, that if I wanted her there I would want my sisters there as well. I stopped there until she started complaining that she was a single mom who raised me on her own, and that I should want to see her first. That’s when I told her I didn’t want her in my house at all when I first get home. I am a married, grown man now, I don’t need my mom, I want to see and spend time with my wife first and foremost. She pressed further saying “I’ve been here for u since before u were born, she’s been here for 4 years.” Eventually trash talking my wife, saying she doesn’t even have a real job and doesn’t contribute. My wife is a nanny while she is in school, and she gets paid well, so she absolutely does contribute more than enough.

This is where I may be the asshole. I told my mom that I was tired of her badgering, that I wanted to come home to my wife and be alone in our home with our pets. My wife and I would not want to host her, and we wanted the house to ourselves so that we can have sex wherever and whenever we please because we haven’t seen each other in so long. 

My mom cried. She’s sending me long paragraph texts every few hours about how she doesn’t know where her caring son went, about how I need to let my wife go because I use her for her body, about how all I care about is my own pleasure, and I have no care for my family at all.

3,1dif6f4,AITA for letting my BF’s little cousins text him on my phone?,"My bf (26M) invited me (24F) to a family dinner at his grandparents’ apartment yesterday. He needed to help his dad install some ACs in his office, so he was not able to come with me to go there (his mom and uncle came to pick me up and drive me there). At his grandparents’ place, I say hello to his aunts and uncles and grandparents and then hang out with his 2 little cousins (one is 12 and the other is like 9 or 10) because everyone else is speaking Cantonese and I felt kind of awkward just sitting there not being able to understand anything. It’s been about 40 minutes and my bf still hasn’t arrived, so his cousins want me to call him and ask where he is. He says he’s still putting in the AC. About 10 minutes later, his cousins ask me if they can send him some texts and I say sure because I don’t want to be mean to some little kids and they were pretty polite about it. Over the course of the next 20 minutes, they send him 6 messages, all along the lines of “where are you, we miss you, please answer us, when are you coming” etc. as well as some stickers. Then, we eat dinner (still without him) and then have dessert and then he finally arrives about an hour later and he’s mad at me because I let his cousins text him on my phone. When I asked him why, he said that it was annoying to feel his phone buzzing while he was trying to put in the AC and that I shouldn’t have let them on my phone. I said sorry and that it wouldn’t happen again, but today he said that he was still mad about it. 

I feel like this is such a childish thing to be mad about - he’s 26 and mad about his own little cousins texting him? He could have just silenced his phone if it bothered him so much. And I’m also bothered that he blamed me for it and decided to “punish” me by saying that he wasn’t going to come over to see me later this week. What was I supposed to do? Tell them that I’m not going to let them text their cousin? And how was I to know that he’d be so bothered by this? I didn’t ask to be left for 2 hours alone with his extended family without him there and I would’ve much rather stayed home if I knew this was going to happen.

We are a childless couple and are not planning to have children anytime soon.

Up until recently we didn't have to worry about groceries as much cause it was just him and I at the house 90% of the time. Recently her and her boyfriend split so she's been home. She's a bit of a control freak when it comes to how she likes to clean and cook. So I took a step back, as it is her house and I don't like to step on toes.

Anyways. She insists on defrosting food on the counter every day, including shrimp, chicken, etc all in the same bowl defrosting on the counter. All. Day. I have explained to her multiple times how bad this is. Her ex husband and her used to fight about it all the time as he was a chef.

I have asked my boyfriend to ask her to stop. I refuse to eat her food and go hungry most nights for the last week. But I am paying for half of these groceries. Including $600 worth of meat she bought just a couple weeks ago. Keep in mind I'm beyond broke right now and have verbalized this and asked to stop spending excessive amounts on food. My request goes unnoticed.

A few days ago I messaged my boyfriend and told him if she does not stop doing this I refuse to pay for groceries and will buy my own food. I'm not paying for food that will make me sick so I'm not eating it anymore. Tonight she decided to do it again, so I refused to eat dinner with them.

UPDATE: Wasn't expecting so many people to chime in, thank you all. Everyone's opinions and comments helped.

He agreed, was quite worried and didn't realize his IBS was connected to eating food defrosted in dangerous temperatures.

I brought all of this up to my boyfriend, including about his health issues and IBS and how it is affecting both of us. I offered to start buying seperate groceries and making us seperate meals. He agreed, was quite worried and didn't realize his IBS was connected to eating food defrosted in dangerous temperatures. He had a conversation with her this morning about it and again today I found a whole chicken defrosting on the counter. I went grocery shopping and we will not be joining her for dinner unless she agrees to stop preparing food dangerously.",0.0,0.106588736,0,1
7,1diet7o,AITA for needing a break from my DND group to help my mental health?,"Hello, first time posting. Feeling very conflicted right now.

I (28f) have been a part of a dnd campaign for just under three years now. It's the best dnd campaign I've ever been in, with a group (party and players) that meshed excellently.

A little background: I'm in an unhealthy and possibly abusive home life. This isn't the place to talk about that, but it's starting to cause my mental health to tank to the point where my work is getting affected. I'm working to try to move out, but it's requiring a LOT of therapy and I've had no energy for anything. This has been quite literally one of the most difficult weeks of my life, and it's looking like it's just going to get harder over the next couple of months. And the entire group is aware of these issues, how much they're affecting me, and that I'm literally in the middle of a crisis.

Because of this, I knew that I wouldn't be able to put myself into a roleplaying headspace every week. I knew that it wouldn't be fair to our Dungeon Mistress or the players because I wouldn't be able to be the character that I know and love. So, I asked for a break. I told the DM that I wouldn't be able to play for a bit. I wasn't very specific, but in my mind, I was thinking maybe two months to try to get myself together and more functional again. She was understanding, and we had talked about the hope of bringing the campaign back once my life was a little bit more functional.

A lot of people in the campaign were very hurt, and I completely understood and thought it was valid to feel that way. I dropped a pretty major bomb on them all of a sudden. Anyway, today, they had a meeting without me, and I have been essentially voted off of the campaign. They said that this was ""a breach of trust"" and a breach of the commitment that we made to each other and our time and investment to each other. 

I'm feeling very conflicted about this, because I know it was rude of me to not consult the group about needing a break, but it feels very hurtful to be removed from a group that meant so much to me when they knew about how hard everything else in my life is.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for needing a break from my DND group to help my mental health?

I haven’t had a relationship with him since I was 13 when he no longer wanted to be apart of my life. Some back story - my mum met my step dad when I was 7 and ever since then he was my dad. 
I met my fiancé when I was 10 we have been together ever since we was 13 and then when we were 16 we welcomed our baby girl into the world even tho she wasn’t planned. The rest of our family’s congratulated us all except my bio dad. When we told everyone that we was engaged it never crossed my mind to tell him, somehow the news got back to him (probably by someone on that side of the family as I’m okay with them). He has been demanding to know when the wedding date is and what she should wear to walk to me down the aisle. I recently sent him a text saying “I don’t know why u would be walking me down the aisle when you are not even invited to my wedding, you haven’t had any involvement in my life for years and you didn’t even congratulate me when I had your granddaughter” - a lot of my family are thinking I should just suck it up for one day and let him walk me down the aisle. However, I believe that it is my day and I should be able to make a choice of who I want there. So AITA?

Info to add for some more information - My bio dad decided one day he didn’t want to be apart of my life : it was after a time I had to cancel going to his house bc I was extremely ill to the point I ended up in hospital for 3 weeks and even then he didn’t visit or ask how I was. After this I admit I didn’t reach out to him!! But I was the kid in this situation and I don’t think that a child should be reaching out to a grown adult to be in their lives a phone works both ways. - I tried for many months after to message him and try and come into contact with him but all of my attempts ended in failure so I gave up!! He choose to not be apart of my life. My stepdad on the other hand was always there for me, when I was in the hospital etc - he never once badmouthed anything my bio father was doing or saying.

9,1die7sk,WIBTA for asking my (26F) friend (28F) to pay my partner (25M) back for her travel fare?,"My friend (28F) came to visit me (26F) while my partner (25M) had to go away on a business trip. I am busy, and I needed help with my puppy during the couple days that I work. My partner offered to pay for my friends travel fare in exchange for this, which she agreed. I was excited, however, throughout her time with me its been a bit of a disaster.

My friend did not let me know that she has a fear of big animals. She knew ahead of time that my very young puppy was a big breed dog, but I do not think that she realized what a bigger puppy entails. For example, she went into the puppy area, and he barked at her to get her to play. She threw his toy a few times, but got angry that he barked at her excitedly to play more. She ran out of the room, saying he was aggressive, but all my dog did was bark at her to throw his toy again. Another example, I let her take my older, more polite dog on a walk while I worked with my puppy, and she got overwhelmed by him even though he was doing nothing but walking and sniffing.

Beyond that, she has not helped me at all. I am disabled, so the help would have been greatly appreciated, and was what was supposed to happen but has not. She said the entire time that she was ""on vacation,"" and only wanted to go out and do more touristy things. My partner paid for her food, stay, and other activities in exchange for her help, but it has not happened at all. She helped clean a few things, but I had to do a lot of cleaning up after her and my car.

Additionally, she made my friends extremely uncomfortable. She kept bringing up politics and grew angry when we did not want to talk about our political views. My friends and I like each other regardless of who we are voting for, but that answer was not enough for her.

Overall, I am extremely upset. We have been friends for a while but I do not know if that will continue. She talked about coming back here, and I do not know how to bring it up that I am unsure whether that's a good idea. I do not want someone who is scared of my dogs in my house overnight. Its stressful for me, my dogs, and I do not think its fair to lock them up all the time. So WIBTA for saying she is no longer allowed to stay here in the future and asking for the plane ticket money back?

Overall, we spent at least $1,000 while she was here with the promise she will help me when my partner leaves.

10,1die5nc,AITA for asking my friend not to bring her friends to my birthday dinner?,"About a month before my birthday, my best friend of 6 years (23F), who recently moved to a different city, texted me to ask if I would be in town for my birthday. I told her I'd be in town on my birthday (a Thursday), but I had a work trip early on Saturday and planned to celebrate my birthday the following weekend. She then told me that she and her boyfriend, who I've never met, were coming into town to see their favorite artist in concert on Friday, the day after my birthday.

She asked if we wanted to go to the show with them, but I declined due to my early work trip. She understood and suggested a birthday dinner on Thursday, to which I excitedly agreed. We planned a double date with her, her boyfriend, my partner, and me.

A week before my birthday, she confirmed their arrival and suggested making it a beach party. I preferred the double dinner date and told her so, as I had already coordinated a celebration with other friends for the following week. She agreed, saying she hoped for the same.

Four days before my birthday, she asked if her boyfriend's friend, who decided to come to the concert, could join us for dinner. I was annoyed because it was my birthday, and we had planned an intimate double date. However, I felt I couldn't say no, so I decided to change my plans and have a group dinner with close friends, including her and her boyfriend’s friend. I texted my other friends, secured a reservation for 10, and tried to get over my annoyance.

The next day, she asked if she could bring another person, a girl from SF joining their Airbnb for the concert, so she wouldn’t be alone on Thursday night. This request really bothered me. I had already changed my plans once and didn't want more strangers at my birthday dinner. I took a day to think and decided to be honest with her.

I texted back basically: I'm so excited to see you and meet your boyfriend. I haven't celebrated my birthday with friends for 3 years, and I was looking forward to an intimate dinner with my close friends. I'd love to have you and your boyfriend there, but I'm not thrilled about 2 strangers coming. I totally get if you need to hang with your concert friends on Thurs, and if so maybe we can do a separate dinner on Fri b4 the show. Lmk

She responded basically saying: Thanks for being honest. We really want to be there but have a responsibility to these two people. They’re staying with us and came to see us. We can’t abandon them. We also can’t do Friday because of the show. I understand it's not ideal for you. If you would have the four of us, I’d be grateful. If not, I understand. Just lmk.

This response upset me, because she even said, ""I didn't anticipate it being an issue for you."" I didn't expect her to invite strangers to my birthday dinner. AITA for feeling angry about this?

I told him he could but they weren’t mine and explained that my ex had left those behind. He got upset and wondered why I still had them here. I explained to him that the only reason I still had them is because I had talked to my exes sister(yes we’re still friends, we were friends before me and him even got together) and told her that I was going to toss them out or sell them since he hadn’t come to pick them up when I gave him the opportunity to, but she asked me to keep them so she could pick them up for him. For context me and my ex lived together for a short time and a couple months after we broke up I blocked him. I had told my bf all of this and he told me that he thought I was lying to him about the timing of the conversation I had with my exes sister. He continued by telling me what me having them there was disrespectful to him and that me “downplaying” (explaining) the situation was a red flag for him. He also told me that I’ve been disrespectful many times before 
Instance 1: 
I got a friend request on Facebook from an old co worker (male) I just ignored it and kept scrolling. Told me I was disrespectful for letting him sit in my requests (along with 20 other random people dating back months to years) I’m out of sight out of mind kind of person and didn’t think twice about it although I understood where he was coming from and cleared my requests as soon as he told me it bothered him

Instance 2: 
I had a security system installed and when the tech was showing me how to use the equipment he was making conversation with me, I kept it short as I wasn’t interested in having a conversation. I fake laughed at his unfunny comments and that was an issue. That I was interacting and laughing with the tech. 


He essentially told me that I’m a giant red flag and he’s unsure if he wants to end the relationship or not. At this point I’m so emotionally exhausted and don’t want to talk to him so I put my phone on dnd. I’m not sure if this relationship dies if I should fight for it or let him go.

12,1die1ak,AITA for not giving up a room we agreed was mine? ,"So I’m moving into a new shared flat for University with 4 of us (F) and we viewed the flat and decided we loved it.

So, a month ago (7th of May - we move in 20th of June), i took a look at the floor plan once we decided to go ahead and put our deposit down, and i noticed a room which was separated from the other 3 which is next to the kitchen (meaning didn’t share a wall with another bedroom).

I sent a message to my friends and said if they didn’t mind, i would like to have that room, purely just because i work online and lots of my friends play games together regularly online and if i was up late i would be concerned about noise for the others esp. during exam season and such.
In this message i expressed that if anyone else wanted it that was completely fine and we could think of a fairer way to do it. 
They all agreed there was no problem with me having it at all.

Now, a month later, 2 days before we move in, 2 of the girls expressed wanting to do the rooms by a hat draw, as they believed it was unfair to “claim” rooms, and someone would end up with the smaller one. they expressed they didn’t think about it when they agreed at the time and only just considered that hightens their chances of having that smaller room. (there is no size difference to my room, there are 3 medium and 1 slightly smaller).

for me, i responded saying i would’ve had no issue with this at the time but considering no issue was raised to me at the time and they all agreed, it should not be left to 2 days before for them to express this issue to me, and there is no fairer way than the way i did it, to ask directly and give the option of a randomised system if they so chose.

i feel it’s unfair for them to now go back on their agreement because they somehow didn’t think at the time it would effect them, i’ve been planning and thinking about this move for a long time and if they didn’t consider that at the time that’s bad planning on their part, and it shouldn’t now be me having to give that room back.

Kacy would often yell at everyone in the chat about chores because the house was disgusting. There’s a lot of other personal behaviors that got to me (misogynistic comments about women, subtle digs at me bcs I didn’t look a certain way, calling herself “a kind hearted and generous person” after she tipped a salon person $8 for cutting her hair) I never brought up how she was the one who was forgetting her chores though because I wanted to be polite. I also did not want to go around personally reminding people to do their chores - the chore chart was in plain view. 

The month before we moved out, Kacy didn’t take out the trash for most of the week and there were maggots underneath the bags. The roommate before her, Chelsea (23f) didn’t take it out for most of the week too but she was out of town.

I’d been avoiding Kacy for months due to her passive aggression atp. 

I took the trash out the next week, but the week after, Chelsea forgot. We were close to moving out and they stopped doing chores for a while. Then Kacy got on the group chat and started asking ""whose turn is it"" and no one replied.

Then she called ME out in the GC the next day. I said it's not my job to remind people but she kept insisting that it is our job to help each other - which is the part which makes me feel like an AH. Then she started going off and saying ""if you can talk shit about us not doing chores behind our backs then you can remind us"" (which is ridiculous, I very clearly expressed my frustration not once but twice in the group chat months ago) and went all ""SPEAK UP, stop being QUIET"" almost bullying me. We went back and forth several times but I stopped reading her messages because I was out and she has a habit of writing long messages that don't say anything. It feels like I am reading a middle schoolers writing. I snapped and asked her to stop talking and just said which roommates turn it is so she would stop texting.

We were discussing this and it evolved into me wondering if I’m an asshole for the following situation: my partner and I both work full time. He’s a plumber and I work from home. He actually really loves cooking (and has gone to school for it) and I enjoy cleaning more when it comes to household tasks. He hates cleaning and I hate cooking so it works out. Because of his job and the fact he has to get up at 5am we tend to go to bed pretty early (9pm). I have asked him to generally have dinner ready at 7 so we have enough time to eat and for me to clean up after, and not have that be rushed right before bed time. Sometimes it’ll go later than planned and then I get frustrated by how late we’re eating and the fact that there are loads of dishes for me to do (we don’t have a dishwasher). He’ll get annoyed with me being visibly annoyed with him but he’s generally pretty okay with me asking to have it be done at a certain time. Am I an asshole for requesting this though and then getting frustrated when it’s not done? If it helps, we both have ADHD and so executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation play a big role here (as he struggles to get up and do things and I get stressed out by tasks and hunger as well). 
This isn’t an actual serious issue in our relationship but he joked about how I should post this and ask the internet their opinion (he’s jokingly called me a demanding 50’s husband before which I thought was hilarious).

15,1didh40,AITA for no longer wanting to talk to my family members after they told me my graduation is not a big deal?,"Hey everyone,

I need some outside opinions on a family situation that’s been really bothering me.

So my cousin recently got engaged, and her wedding is scheduled for august. She came over to my house to flaunt her engagement to my mom, which was a bit off since she never visits us when she's in town. Before they set the date, I specifically asked her and her fiance not to have the wedding on the day of my graduation. I'm graduating with a bachelor's degree in veterinary and biomedical science and I'm the first in my family to be on the path to becoming a doctor.

Despite my request, I found out from other family members that she planned her wedding for the same day anyway. She's even told people that "" I didn't have a graduation, so what huge deal is it really?"" and that her wedding is more important than my achievement. This really hurt me, and I expressed my frustration to my family. However, they think I'm making a huge deal out of it and said that graduations aren't as important as people make them seem.

To add to the frustration, these are the same family members who joke about getting free veterinary advice when I finally enter my profession. It feels like they're dismissing my hard work and achievements while still expecting to benefit from it in the future. this also comes from YEARS of being treated differently than my cousins and this made me rethink if ever want to be in a family setting ever again. I feel like my hard work and achievement are being completely overlooked, and I’m really upset. Am I overreacting here, or do I have a right to be mad about this?

16,1dj5acy,AITA for asking my 33F LDR husband 42M to share his bank acct info? ,"Hi Reddit. First post as I just had a big fight with my 33F husband 42M. He’s American and I am Canadian and we have been married for a year now LDR. I am going to move to his city for a couple of months as we are TTC and I have asked him to share his bank info. 
The reason I asked is because when I went to see him a couple of times in the past, he would give me his credit card and I appreciate that. However, one time I asked him if we could visit a different city and he said no because we had just come from another trip and didn’t have money. Then a few days later he said that he wanted to travel to another city and I didn’t say anything but it struck a nerve. Also that same trip he questioned me about one of the purchase on his card ($100). So today I explained to him that it feels like a parental-child relationship because he checks all my expenses and must approve all my big asks but he doesn’t have to do that because it’s his own account. I told him it makes me feel like there’s a power imbalance in our relationship. Also since I’m going on unpaid leave from my job to go to his city to TTC, it’s only fair that he shares his bank info since it’s “our money”. He says that once i permanently move, he’s open to have a joint bank account but doesn’t feel comfortable to share his bank info now because i could go back to years and check his transactions etc. The reason i want access is so that I can feel like it’s OUR bank and we are both on the same team and adults. Whereas if i was to double check my purchases with him, it makes me feel like a child.

We haven't been dating for over a year but we still live together and attend the same school. Even if I don't feel romantically towards her any more, I still care about her a lot and feel like we should be best friends, especially after all the life events we've been through—we were together 6 years. She says she feels the same, and that I'm so important to her. But ever since she hooked up with someone new, she's been gone the entire summer visiting them and I've barely heard a word from her. No updates, no chatting, no ""hi, how are you."" It's been insanely awkward and stressful.

Then, out of nowhere, I get a phone call from her. She tells me that to get into some kind of grad program she needs to be a permanent resident, so she needs me to ""sponsor"" her. The only thing is we need to lie to an agent about still being a couple. I don't know what kind of immigration program she's talking about, assuming it's some obscure thing where I just need to vouch for her, which I'd be happy to do. But I ask, ""is it like getting married? Will my status as legally single be affected?"" She assures me no, no, it's nothing like that, it's no big deal, I just need to sign some paperwork. She doesn't tell me her dad is also on the line until he starts talking, while she knows that due to past experiences not only do I have issues saying ""no"" to people, but I have serious issues saying ""no"" to grown men. Then she sends me an article about common law—what she described as a ""sponsorship.""

She has a history of asking the world of me and then getting really, really upset when I don't give it to her, even though I truly did try my best to do so for 6 years. She'll still tell me that she cares about me like family and that she'll always be there for me. Yet she only talks to me at all now when she wants something from me. Still, I can't help but feel responsible for her, and like I'm ruining her life by not helping her pursue school. In the past I gave her everything I could, but now I'm sure she's talking to her new partner and friends about how horrible I am, the same way she'd talk about her other exes, which is exactly what I was afraid of when we broke up. But I can't help still caring, and how do I know she's not wrong? I already feel like a horrible person all the time anyway. As mentioned above, I have a really, really hard time saying no to people.

20,1dj48kg,AITA for not trusting my gf?,"I (m20) and my gf (f19) have been together for 3 years and I haven't ever had issues with trusting her.

We both work in the same place together and we met this guy whom I'll call Bobby. For simplicity sakes and for everyone's sake I won't be specific or use real names. He is a nice guy and became friends with my girlfriend, she gave him rides and they hang out, which is good and that wasn't a problem for me.
He began asking my gf to come over without inviting me and she would TELL me she is hanging out with him with less than an hour of warning. She didn't ask or anything, this was still fine in my mind though because I was afraid of seeming like the bad guy so I thought nothing of it in the end. She did this everytime they would hang out. she also wouldn't even attempt to invite me.
Now the issue that snowballed everything... one time they went to a cultural specific activity because they are the same and I'm not, so I thought that was fine, then she went to his house for a little bit... a little bit turned into her being gone for 14 hours with no warning and like 2 texts. This had me worrying a bit but still kept a mentality of trying to avoid controlling her so I brushed it off. So about 10 hours in, my friend comes to the house and we talk and he asks ""is she still gone dude?"". So I answer yes and he looks at me in a worried face and says ""bro you need to get your girl, something is weird about this guy"". So I start freaking out on the inside not knowing what to do and just waited till she got home.
So I tried talking to her the next day about my worries and named off what happened. Her going to his place without me everytime so far, the night before, and his overall weirdness to not invite her bf despite probably knowing how wrong that looks. So she shares that she doesn't think he likes her and she seemed grossed out by the thought. She then goes into details about the day and names very specific things. Stating nothing happened between them. Now at this point I'm taking everything with a grain of salt but I love her and have trusted her for 3 years so why would I let this break it? I told her I wasn't comfortable about that night and wanted only the people that know what happened that night to keep it secret. Next day We go to work and my same friend that told me he was worried ended up telling me that she is basically bragging about how long she was gone yesterday from home. I WAS FUMING.
So I revisit the conversation with her because apperently me being uncomfortable didn't really matter to her and came as a bragging right. She then says it's on me if imma be angry at her just because she wants to visit a male friend and that I should grow up, she then defends all his actions and justified him only inviting her and everything he has done so far. 

I don't expect anyone to outright have an answer to solve my problem but is this definently something of suspicion or should I drop it?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for not trusting my gf? I (m20) and my gf (f19) have been together for 3 years and I haven't ever had issues with trusting her.

We both work in the same place together and we met this guy whom I'll call Bobby. For simplicity sakes and for everyone's sake I won't be specific or use real names. He is a nice guy and became friends with my girlfriend, she gave him rides and they hang out, which is good and that wasn't a problem for me.
He began asking my gf to come over without inviting me and she would TELL me she is hanging out with him with less than an hour of warning. She didn't ask or anything, this was still fine in my mind though because I was afraid of seeming like the bad guy so I thought nothing of it in the end. She did this everytime they would hang out. she also wouldn't even attempt to invite me.
Now the issue that snowballed everything... one time they went to a cultural specific activity because they are the same and I'm not, so I thought that was fine, then she went to his house for a little bit... a little bit turned into her being gone for 14 hours with no warning and like 2 texts. This had me worrying a bit but still kept a mentality of trying to avoid controlling her so I brushed it off. So about 10 hours in, my friend comes to the house and we talk and he asks ""is she still gone dude?"". So I answer yes and he looks at me in a worried face and says ""bro you need to get your girl, something is weird about this guy"". So I start freaking out on the inside not knowing what to do and just waited till she got home.
So I tried talking to her the next day about my worries and named off what happened. Her going to his place without me everytime so far, the night before, and his overall weirdness to not invite her bf despite probably knowing how wrong that looks. So she shares that she doesn't think he likes her and she seemed grossed out by the thought. She then goes into details about the day and names very specific things. Stating nothing happened between them. Now at this point I'm taking everything with a grain of salt but I love her and have trusted her for 3 years so why would I let this break it? I told her I wasn't comfortable about that night and wanted only the people that know what happened that night to keep it secret. Next day We go to work and my same friend that told me he was worried ended up telling me that she is basically bragging about how long she was gone yesterday from home. I WAS FUMING.

21,1dj456a,AITA for not being able to dogsit for my brother in law?,"For context: I’ve been with my boyfriend for over 5 years and over that time have become very close with his brother(Matt) and his brothers fiancé(Ellie)I would consider us all good friends

Hi all, so Matt and Ellie away 2 weeks ago on holiday, they needed someone to dogsit for them(Friday-Monday)me and my boyfriend both work and have a cat at home so dogsitting was hard for us trying to juggle work,our cat and their dog but we agreed. For context,their dog is a banned breed in the UK so therefore couldn’t go in a shelter.

The weekend before dogsitting,I found out that I had to babysit my nephew(who’s 11) as no one else in the family could have him, I messaged ellie explaining in detail,saying I was sorry and that we can have the dog the rest of the weekend just not Sunday as my nephew couldn’t sleep at their house(due to there only being 1 bed) and I couldn’t leave him home alone. We also had plans to go out Sunday day, and this would’ve been ok as the dog wouldn’t have been alone long but adding in the fact I had my nephew all day meant the dog would’ve been alone for over 8 hours which I thought would be cruel.

She replied to my message simply saying “I’ll see what I can do” and shortly after matt called my boyfriend going crazy,calling us selfish and stupid and saying we’d ruined their holiday.

This was really hurtful,as I tried my best to make it work to help them with their dog. I also had no control over having my nephew and like I said I was asked the weekend before.

Anyways, their holiday went fine, they didn’t need to cancel and they found someone to have the dog when we couldn’t, matt apologised to us both explaining he was just upset that he was worried he’d have to cancel the holiday and I assumed we  had moved on.

Fast forward to Saturday night,we were all meant to be meeting at the in-laws to have a takeaway together,then my boyfriend gets a message from matt“you and your girlfriend need to apologise to ellie as if you don’t she’s not coming tonight”. This made me mad,as what had I done to have to say sorry?and I already did?but anyway,I swallowed my pride and accepted that yes I probably did hurt them unintentionally and messaged saying sorry,I hope we are still friends and I did not mean to mess you around on purpose.

They both read the message and ignore me completely. When we get to their parents(my future inlaws),they’re both there and act like everything is fine and try to talk to me,but honestly I’m confused and hurt?they got the apology so why can’t they accept it and move on?they didn’t have to cancel the holiday? So what’s the issue? I messaged them again today telling theme how much this hurt me and how I don’t understand why I’m being punished and they read the message and again ignore it? AITA? Do I deserve this?

She is extremely noise, and will come out of her house is she hears us just to talk. Now I'm very introverted and just want to enjoy going outside alone sometimes. Well from the day we moved in she said she lets her dogs go on both sides of the yard, at first we didn't see anything wrong with that, she's lived their for 4 years and no ones complained to our knowledge. Well we should have said we weren't ok with it. She has two dogs, an old almost blind and deaf pug and a younger Chihuahua, she also has an indoor/outdoor cat she rescued from previous owners of our side. Well as time went on it started to frustrate us more cause she would walk past our windows and look in to play with our cat. Which is weird to me. But an important thing is my dog was not socialized well which I admit is my fault, so my dog dosnt like her dogs at all. They get in her space while she's trying to go to the bathroom. I always leash my dog no matter what while she lets her dogs off leash and screams their names,in front of out windows, tell them come to her. So eventually we had enough and I texted her; ""Hey we have been wanting to say something to you about the dogs going on our side but we felt awkward since you said you’ve always done it. It makes us uncomfortable when you and your family stand at our windows and also play with loki(our cat). But also aero(our dog) dosnt get along with your dogs and since she is always on leash and yours arnt it will end badly. She could end up attacking to get them out of her space, I do not wish to test her limits. It’s not fair to any of them and we don’t want any dogs getting hurt."" She ended up ignoring me and for the next few days slamming her door anytime she went in and out, it was very awkward and uncomfortable. So eventually she talked to us and said she's trying to stay away from our windows, completely missing my whole point. So we just let it go. Well now I just feel I need to know am I in the wrong? She lets her kids dogs go poop and not pick it up in our yard yet if she's out their when I take my dog she asks if I need a poop bag, which I always pick it up since it's a rental. It just feels disrespectful to let your dogs and others in someone else's yard. And to make it clear I have asked my landlord if that's my yard and he said yes and I did mention she goes in our yard constantly.

27,1dj3if5,AITA for telling a parent that her autistic child shouldn't be at a sports camp?,"Throw away because I'm probably the asshole on this. I (20f) have coached a sports camp over the summer for the last several years at my local elementary school. The camp covers all sorts of sports and games for kids in elementary school to let them try many different sports and see which ones might stick.

This year, we've started an inclusion program for kids on the spectrum, where ""inclusion specialists"" work at our camp specifically to look after those kids and help them through the camp if they need it. I've really enjoyed this program and nothing is better than watching a kid find a sport they enjoy or excel at.

Fast forward to this week, the third week we're holding the camp, and enter Connor and his mother Sara (fake names obv). Connor is 10, on the older side for this camp, and when we first met him in the morning, he seemed like a pretty good kid to work with at a camp. The problem was his mother.

She pulled me aside before the day started to specifically tell me about what Connor needed. Turns out, Connor had pretty severe meltdowns and what triggered them was losing.

His mother asked me to make sure Connor never lost a game. This included his team never losing, letting him win all the races, making sure his team came first in the relays, never letting him get tagged in tag, and never letting him get eliminated in any sort of last-man-standing game. I told her on no uncertain terms that I couldn't control that, and that was unfair to the other kids if I told them to always let him win.

She was not happy about this and told me that they were trying to avoid meltdowns this week and that he was working on it, but losing was still incredibly emotional for him. I told her that she really shouldn’t have sent him to a sports camp if she thought it would put him in distress or force all the other kids to cater to him. She asked me what the hell the inclusion program was for, and I told her it meant I as a coach could help him and his inclusion specialist could help him, but the other kids weren’t a part of this inclusion program.

She left very angry, but left Connor with us for the day, during which he had two meltdowns that the inclusion specialist dealt with, but I started feeling guilty. The whole point of the program was to allow kids like him to participate, but I didn’t want to sacrifice the other kids' experience just for him. So, AITA?

Edit: Thank you so much for your interactions, but here's a few quick details that I think got lost along the way! 1) This is not just a camp for neurodivergent kids, we brought a program in to integrate those kids in with the neurotypical kids. Over the past three weeks, there's been about a 10:1 ratio of neurotypical to neurodivergent. 2) This is a pretty small camp (20-30 kids max) and my neighbor used to run this camp when I was in high school, but when I graduated he handed a lot of it over to me. He now runs the financial, location, marketing, and legal stuff while I organize most of the camp itself along with a few other coaches, 2 of whom are still in high school, 2 in college. There isn't really a supervisor or higher up I can hand the mother over to except for the inclusion specialist. Hope this helps!

Edit 2 (sorry!): I don't hire the inclusion specialists, nor do I know exactly what they're qualified with, but they are working through a separate program outside our camp that we partnered with. They match the neurodivergent kids 1:1, and they are provided with all the information with the kids including lists of trigger and what calms them down. They are all qualified adults (real adults not college students and high schoolers like the coaches) and as far as I could tell they handled Connor's meltdowns with a lot of patience and expertise and got him back to playing with the other kids within a half-hour or so after each inciting incident. When I originally told Sara that the camp was likely not a good fit for Connor, I was more thinking about how the kid would be miserable in a cycle of meltdowns all day, and not about the qualifications of the inclusion program.

UPDATE! Thank you so much to everyone for your advice, comments, anecdotes, and support, I really appreciated it. Good news! Connor came back today, this time with his dad, who didn’t offer any sort of complaints or comments about yesterday to me or the inclusion therapist. From the two days and now five meltdowns (all lasting under an hour each) we’ve had with Connor, I believe either his mother underestimated his emotional regulation and ability to move on from losses, or the inclusion specialist was able to curb and limit his meltdowns better than she did at home. We tried to mitigate the situations where he would lose (for example we didn’t keep score during the large matches) but elimination games caused the meltdowns. For the record, he didn’t meltdown EVERY time he was eliminated or tagged, and he really wanted to participate in those games with the other kids, which is why we didn’t pull him from them. 

 I also want to explain why I originally thought the camp wouldn’t be a good space for Connor, and how I was proven wrong. I’ve always seen the camp as a place for kids to have fun and try new things, and I didn’t consider its value as a space for learning to manage triggers and work through emotions since we just introduced this program this year. From the way Sara described Connor’s emotional state, I heard about a kid who would likely hate most parts of the camp we ran, and would be very unhappy for seven hours a day for a week. While I understand the value of working through those upsetting emotions, the camp I run is meant to be fun, not stressful, or akin to a therapy session.

 I felt this way because I grew up with pretty severe anxiety related to school and I would have panic attacks before tests, so trying to imagine my parents sending me to a “Big Test Camp” for some exposure therapy during my summer break sounded horrible. Ignoring any sort of disability, competitive sports don’t mesh well with certain personalities. While they have always been a great outlet for me, I see kids all the time who really don’t enjoy how competition makes them feel emotionally or physically but are pushed into them by overbearing parents trying to relive their glory days. 

Ultimately, once I explained to Sara that I wasn’t going to rig the games, I understand now how saying he shouldn’t be at the camp had the wrong connotation, but I wanted the kid to have fun, and I didn’t want to place him in a position he couldn’t do that. Ultimately, I was wrong, and even with the meltdowns he’s had, I think the inclusion specialists are really helping him and I still agree with most of you that Sara was unreasonable. However, I also do stand by the fact that if Connor was as volatile and emotional when he lost as his mother made him seem, I don’t think the camp would have been a good place for him YET. Turns out, it was, and I’m glad Sara left him with us. 

Also to those of you who caught on to my Terminator reference, I hope you have an absolutely fantastic day :)",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for telling a parent that her autistic child shouldn't be at a sports camp? Throw away because I'm probably the asshole on this. I (20f) have coached a sports camp over the summer for the last several years at my local elementary school. The camp covers all sorts of sports and games for kids in elementary school to let them try many different sports and see which ones might stick.

This year, we've started an inclusion program for kids on the spectrum, where ""inclusion specialists"" work at our camp specifically to look after those kids and help them through the camp if they need it. I've really enjoyed this program and nothing is better than watching a kid find a sport they enjoy or excel at.

Fast forward to this week, the third week we're holding the camp, and enter Connor and his mother Sara (fake names obv). Connor is 10, on the older side for this camp, and when we first met him in the morning, he seemed like a pretty good kid to work with at a camp. The problem was his mother.

She pulled me aside before the day started to specifically tell me about what Connor needed. Turns out, Connor had pretty severe meltdowns and what triggered them was losing.

His mother asked me to make sure Connor never lost a game. This included his team never losing, letting him win all the races, making sure his team came first in the relays, never letting him get tagged in tag, and never letting him get eliminated in any sort of last-man-standing game. I told her on no uncertain terms that I couldn't control that, and that was unfair to the other kids if I told them to always let him win.

She was not happy about this and told me that they were trying to avoid meltdowns this week and that he was working on it, but losing was still incredibly emotional for him. I told her that she really shouldn’t have sent him to a sports camp if she thought it would put him in distress or force all the other kids to cater to him. She asked me what the hell the inclusion program was for, and I told her it meant I as a coach could help him and his inclusion specialist could help him, but the other kids weren’t a part of this inclusion program.

She left very angry, but left Connor with us for the day, during which he had two meltdowns that the inclusion specialist dealt with, but I started feeling guilty. The whole point of the program was to allow kids like him to participate, but I didn’t want to sacrifice the other kids' experience just for him. So, AITA?

Edit: Thank you so much for your interactions, but here's a few quick details that I think got lost along the way! 1) This is not just a camp for neurodivergent kids, we brought a program in to integrate those kids in with the neurotypical kids. Over the past three weeks, there's been about a 10:1 ratio of neurotypical to neurodivergent. 2) This is a pretty small camp (20-30 kids max) and my neighbor used to run this camp when I was in high school, but when I graduated he handed a lot of it over to me. He now runs the financial, location, marketing, and legal stuff while I organize most of the camp itself along with a few other coaches, 2 of whom are still in high school, 2 in college. There isn't really a supervisor or higher up I can hand the mother over to except for the inclusion specialist. Hope this helps!

Edit 2 (sorry!): I don't hire the inclusion specialists, nor do I know exactly what they're qualified with, but they are working through a separate program outside our camp that we partnered with. They match the neurodivergent kids 1:1, and they are provided with all the information with the kids including lists of trigger and what calms them down. They are all qualified adults (real adults not college students and high schoolers like the coaches) and as far as I could tell they handled Connor's meltdowns with a lot of patience and expertise and got him back to playing with the other kids within a half-hour or so after each inciting incident. When I originally told Sara that the camp was likely not a good fit for Connor, I was more thinking about how the kid would be miserable in a cycle of meltdowns all day, and not about the qualifications of the inclusion program.

UPDATE! Thank you so much to everyone for your advice, comments, anecdotes, and support, I really appreciated it. Good news! Connor came back today, this time with his dad, who didn’t offer any sort of complaints or comments about yesterday to me or the inclusion therapist. From the two days and now five meltdowns (all lasting under an hour each) we’ve had with Connor, I believe either his mother underestimated his emotional regulation and ability to move on from losses, or the inclusion specialist was able to curb and limit his meltdowns better than she did at home. We tried to mitigate the situations where he would lose (for example we didn’t keep score during the large matches) but elimination games caused the meltdowns. For the record, he didn’t meltdown EVERY time he was eliminated or tagged, and he really wanted to participate in those games with the other kids, which is why we didn’t pull him from them. 

 I also want to explain why I originally thought the camp wouldn’t be a good space for Connor, and how I was proven wrong. I’ve always seen the camp as a place for kids to have fun and try new things, and I didn’t consider its value as a space for learning to manage triggers and work through emotions since we just introduced this program this year. From the way Sara described Connor’s emotional state, I heard about a kid who would likely hate most parts of the camp we ran, and would be very unhappy for seven hours a day for a week. While I understand the value of working through those upsetting emotions, the camp I run is meant to be fun, not stressful, or akin to a therapy session.

 I felt this way because I grew up with pretty severe anxiety related to school and I would have panic attacks before tests, so trying to imagine my parents sending me to a “Big Test Camp” for some exposure therapy during my summer break sounded horrible. Ignoring any sort of disability, competitive sports don’t mesh well with certain personalities. While they have always been a great outlet for me, I see kids all the time who really don’t enjoy how competition makes them feel emotionally or physically but are pushed into them by overbearing parents trying to relive their glory days. 

Ultimately, once I explained to Sara that I wasn’t going to rig the games, I understand now how saying he shouldn’t be at the camp had the wrong connotation, but I wanted the kid to have fun, and I didn’t want to place him in a position he couldn’t do that.

28,1dj30fj,AITA for posting a video of my friends online without asking them first?,"
I (26F) have been friends with Kate (26F) since college. Even though we had different majors, we got along really well and are now close friends. I met Daphne (24F) through my boyfriend, Josh (28M). Daphne is Josh's cousin.

I introduced Kate and Daphne to each other and they immediately hit it off. They became best friends and eventually girlfriends. They have been dating for almost a year now, and it is adorable how much they love each other.

Back when they were at the stage of getting to know each other, each of them would meet up with me separately and gush about the other. I used to take short video recordings of their comments on the other person just for fun. For instance I have videos of Kate gushing about Daphne's artistic side, her humor, beauty, kindness, etc. I also have recordings of Daphne praising Kate's discipline, dedication, and her line of work (she's going to be a lawyer/attorney soon). 

For their first anniversary, I put together a two minute complilation of the two of then gushing about each other, I ended it by adding a cute photo of them kissing. I posted it online on my socials along with a congratulations note. A bit later they both started calling me (especially Kate) and said what I did was unacceptable, and that I should take it down.

Kate went as far as accusing me of betraying her trust (because she's a private person and rarely if ever, shares these things). She demanded me to delete my posts. I did not want any more trouble so I just deleted the whole thing. It was just a cute little surprise for them.

I have been getting a lot of negative feedback for this from friends or everyone who found out what the problem was. Kate and Daphne have been ignoring me ever since. They don't even pick up my calls. Was I an AH? Some friends say it was clearly a well intended surpsrise. At this point I don't even know.

29,1dj2rei,WIBTA if I convince my grandma to do this?,"Throwaway because I don't use Reddit and don't want to make finding me irl easier if I ever do in the future

I (13NB) have a weird family situation. My mom (42F) and dad (60M) both are pretty absent, my dad isnt even a guardian. My mom was involved until I was 4-5, but then she left to go live with her boyfriend (63M). Ever since then, weve been LC and Ive lived with my grandma (73F). Normally Id see her every 2 months and regularly text her. Recently shes been ignoring me and my grandma. Ive been on delivered for over 2 months now and my grandma hasnt had a single response from her for 4 months.

Now for the part thats more relevant. Me and my therapist are sure I have some form of ADHD, so my grandmother scheduled an assessment to see and get a diagnosis if I do. She tried to get my mom to be able to come, but she ignored us. We sent the first text around 2 months ago, which is when she stopped opening them. It was the first one left on delivered. We kept trying to contact her. My aunt (56F) even started texting her, and she responded. But when my aunt had mentioned how we havent even gotten an opened text from her she just said ""Oh, Ill check that"" and never did. Then my aunt got stuck on delivered. This was in May. We kept trying, my grandma left a note on my moms door too, as she wasn't at her there at that point to talk. We know she didn't move btw since they both dont have the money to move (bf is a cheap [$8 per hour] freelance worker, mom is unemployed). 

We showed up to the assessment anyways, but couldnt get it. I live in Pennsylvania so law states that you have to be 14+ to get any mental help (apart from therapy I guess) without both guardians permission. But since my grandma is only coguardian, we need my mom. No exceptions. I've been struggling in school from this issue and my mom knows, as I mentioned it in previous texts before she started ignoring us. She definitely has the note, so it seems she doesnt care. A diagnosis would literally help me so much with my education, but my mom is standing in the way of it. The only way I could be able to do this without waiting a whole year, as my birthday is in the beginning of June, is to get a Judge to remove her guardianship. My grandma is considering it. I really want it, but I dont want to hurt my mom. Shes depressed and is probably bipolar (she has almost all symptoms). I know she'll take it as us disliking her and not wanting her around, which is the complete opposite. We both love her and want her around, but she's always saying that we don't.

So, Reddit, since you guys have better judgment than me, WIBTA if I tell my grandma to bring my mom to a judge to try to remove her guardianship? If you have any questions, Ill respond to the best of my ability.

30,1dj2o0i,AITA For Seeing My Boyfriends Family More Than My Own (and for not going to my sister's birthday party),"My(25F) family lives 20 minutes away from mine and my boyfriend's(27M) apartment. His family lives nearly 2 hours away. We never go to see my family. I used to be particularly close to my family however we were very dysfunctional and there is some trauma. I miss them very very much but every time I do see them my sister(21F) just stays in her room and my mom(47F) just sits on her bed and plays on her tablet. Or they're all just getting high. I hate going to see them and so does my boyfriend but I feel really guilty for never doing it like really really guilty. 

I often site mental health overwhelm and burnout as reasons for not having room for such social interactions and they're fairly understanding but they are starting to get tired of the excuses and always swerving plans. However it seems that everytime they reach out to me about 70 percent of the time it's only because they want something from me like a ride etc. I find them exhausting to be around if I'm being honest.

I feel especially terrible because even though my boyfriends family lives 2 hours away we see them way more often. I like my boyfriends family alot they're really great people and they make me feel appreciated. I don't know if it's just because they aren't my family is why I feel I get a larger welcoming from them but I always look forward to seeing them. 

I don't particularly hate my family and I do miss them alot and feel horribly guilty but its never the same when I go to visit and I'm not into what they're into. I would honestly rather just be at home with my cat and my boyfriend.

The biggest thing is my boyfriend and I made plans for the 4th of July weekend. We both had July 4th off from work so we took that Friday off as well and made plans to be out of town. My sister messages me later in the week and tells me her birthday party is that Friday. I had totally forgotten about her birthday but wasn't exacting her to do anything either. So I told her my boyfriend and I already made plans. She's mad now and I feel bad but really don't want to go. It's worse because we haven't seen eachother in months.

Anyway I kinda started rambling

I (22yo female) and my 23 yo female roommate/best friend have lived together since Freshman year of college (going on 6 years now). We have had an amazing pure friendship full of laughter and good times up until about a year ago. She started dating this new guy (23 yo male) who has decided to wedge himself in between our friendship and cause a lot of problems.

Long story short, he started to text me and tell me that he would rather be single, called her psycho, etc. He then goes on to say how he has had dreams about me but won't tell me unless we are alone and in person (I decline).

34,1dj1sir,AITA For Asking Why I’m Not Being Included In FriendOuting Anymore?,"So I don’t know what to do anymore because I feel very conflicted about the situation.

I (21,Female) have recently noticed something off out my friend group. Small background, we all meet during our freshman year of highschool, there are only four of us and we have gone though a lot together. From toxic relationships with old members of our friend group, bad exs, life altering situations, ect. So we are a pretty close group of friends.

We use to hang out almost every week, but as we all know life changes and work and family come up, which is totally fine, and I get that. So we have on and off gotten together.

Recently I noticed that they have been getting together just like we use to. And yes I mean they, not me.

One day I was talking to one of my friends, Tyler, on the phone when he goes “oh I guess im going out with Jamie, she just texted me….I would ask you to come but I know you don’t like the place we are going….” He then talked about going out with Jamie until she showed up where he then proceeded to ignore me while we were still on the phone and we eventually hung up without a word to each other. Later that week Jamie out of no where bought me a present. Then texted me a few days later being like “we should hang out! I haven’t seen you in a while!” But it turned into a group hang out.

Then last week he picks up our other friend Sarah from work and hangs out with her….and then I find out that Jamie also picked up Tyler and they hung out at Jamie’s place. The thing that made me upset was that I live only a few blocks away from Tyler, so if they really wanted they could have asked me to hang out. They also lied saying that it was only Sarah they hung out with that day, but Tyler accidentally told me he was with them.

I told one of my other side friend about the situation and how I just don’t know if I did anything wrong or if maybe I’m just not as cool to hang out the group or maybe just Jamie alone. It’s not that I’m feeling insecure over it, it just feels like they might be trying to hide their hangouts from me, which I find weird because why would that do that? Now my friend is saying I’m a ahole if I say anything to the group because I’m being petty.

It’s a really busy time at work and I’ve been feeling mentally drained with a full time job, studying, working out, taking care of family, and chores. I told her that I couldn’t edit her paper because I was busy. 

She didn’t reply after that but sometime last week I decided to go on a hike and read to relax and de-stress. I posted a picture to instagram that Penny ended up seeing and she confronted me. 

We got into a bit of an argument and she expected me to apologize for lying to her. One on hand I could have given up my relaxing time to help Penny out, but I feel like I needed time to relax.

37,1dj10zr,AITA for taking back my keys to my grandma’s house so my brother couldn’t use them ,"English is not my first language, sorry the weird wording (I’m using google translate for some words)

I (20f) am living in another country for university. Since rent here is so high, my grandma offered me a place to stay in exchange for household help and some financial support from my parents. However, my grandma is very old, aggressive and stubborn. Things escalated a couple of months ago when I asked if I could buy a drawer for my room and she got mad and threatened to throw me out and make me homeless. We had an argument and I decided to leave and move in with a friend.

My father sometimes visits and borrowed my spare keys, but he left them at my grandma’s. My brother (16m) will be staying with her soon and using my keys. I wanted to see him and arrange a lunch to get my keys back, but he ignored my calls and messages for weeks. When he finally responded, he said “I don’t want to see you thank you bye”. I was confused, so I called my mom, who explained why he’s mad.

Basically, I have two parrots that I had to leave at home when I moved. My parents agreed to care for them, but I suspected they were just doing the bare minimum, so I often checked on them during visits. One day, I saw an Instagram story of my brother and his friends partying in my room at 2 a.m., SHAKING THE PARROTS CAGE. I sent the story to my mom and decided to leave my parrots to a trusted friend of mine who is taking care of them. My brother got in trouble because of the story, and he’s been mad at me since.

My parents are on vacation and indifferent to the situation, so I decided to take back my keys from my grandma’s place before my brother arrives. This means he would need to ask my grandma to let him in, and wouldn’t be able stay out late because she goes to bed early. I felt this was reasonable given his disrespectful behavior towards me. He abused my pets, posted it online and then gave me the silent treatment for weeks. Yeah there is no way I’m lending him my keys.

I went to my grandma’s, reconciled with her (though I’m still staying with my friend), and took my keys. My mother thinks this was petty. While I partly did it to teach my brother a lesson, I also needed my keys to access the house after he leaves. My grandma goes on vacation the day after he leaves, and the keys would remain inside the house so I wouldn’t be able to get in. She’ll come back in September. This seemed the only viable solution since my brother refused to see me.

My mother believes I should have tried harder to make amends because my brother is younger and doesn’t understand that he’s wrong. I don’t care. He’s 16 and ignored me for weeks without even telling me why he was mad, which I had to learn from my mom. He abused my pets and posted it online; he’s lucky all I did was send the story to my mom.

Added, this is a trash account.

background information: So I (f18), just got a job at a restaurant, my mom (f57) has been insulting me and verbally abusing me for years but I was never allowed to get a job. I got money from an art thing and put it in savings. We’re extremely poor!

The situation today: I just went to an interview at 1:00 and got the job. When I met up with my mom after at Walmart, we had to get shoes and pants for said job. I told her that we have the option to wear jeans on weekends but had to wear black pants on weekdays. She started lecturing me about how I was saying one thing one time then changing my story. When we went to pay, I paid all I have, $35, towards the amount and promised to make up the rest after I got my first paycheck. When we got in the car she was visibly mad and kept being rude. She started lecturing me about how she still had to pay off something I got years ago as a gift and how ungreatful I was. I explained that it wasn’t like that and how I’m stressed and trying to help her pay for things by getting a job. She made a comment about how I never help with any bills and I only ever want to do fun things and never want to work. I explained how that’s not true because I’ve been working with her on her business since 2021, and that I’ve been working my butt off for years to help her. She proceeded to say I never help with anything else and I always tell her 24/7 how terrible of a mother and person she is. She went on with this rant about how horrible I am until she got out of the car and ended by saying that I told her to “pay for it and shut up” then left saying “well who paid for your stuff right there?” I started crying and saying that I told her I’d pay her back. She then got back in the car, looking proud of herself and like she hadn’t just screamed at her daughter until she cried. She then proceeded to move on with her day while I’ve been crying since.

I have never played with my boyfriend for the entire time we've been together (1.5 years). Its a super nerdy game, not for everyone, but everyone needs their hobbies. I do love any other type of games, board games, card games, lawn games, you name it. 

The thing is my BF is always making plans, getting invited to, and playing magic with his friends and family. I would say the frequency is sometimes weekly, sometimes biweekly. He often invites me, knowing I would have nothing to do but watch, and has even suggested I come along and ""play with the kids"" ie babysit while they play. 

I have tried to be open and understanding and not take it personally. But at this point, I feel left out and excluded. They never offer to play something else so that I can participate.

I’ll admit I was not pleasant the first time, it wasn’t somewhere I wanted to be and was in a bad mood. Later that year around Christmas we went to a Christmas party and one of his sons (24M) came as well. He had moved the car keys and I was not afraid to tell him that he was the last one that moved them and he should know where he put them. He was being extremely stupid, but “boys will be boys” is what they say. He deals with some pretty severe mental health problems but granted so do I, and it seems like it’s to the same degree or comparable at least. I’ve never enjoyed his company or his energy. We went camping 2 summers ago and the oldest son (M25) and I got along great. I was not unpleasant in this trip however I was dealing with a breakup at the time. I tried my best to be present and be engaged. He made no effort to get to know me and I did not go out of my way to do that for him. 

Fast forward to today. 
My mom’s Bf is celebrating his birthday on the 20th and mine is 5 days later. I suggested we go to an escape room for my bday and so we are going in the 23rd. Right in between both of our birthdays. This has now turned into a joint celebration that I planned. My mom asked me what kind of dessert l want and I said that I mentioned carrot cake last year.

I’m pretty annoyed because not only am I having to share my bday events and plans (the last 4 years it’s always been separate events) my mom also invited both his sons. Mind you not even a week ago I was telling my mom how much I dislike his youngest son. I can’t help but feeling like my birthday is not important enough, and I keep getting told by my mom that I’m being selfish for not wanting to share my special day. I don’t ask for much, I rarely even give a list or even ideas of what I want for my birthday and Christmas when the times come. It hurts that how I feel is not being considered but I can’t voice this because I’ll just get told how selfish I am. Is it wrong for me to not want them there? Is it wrong for me to be selfish when it is still my birthday? 

I don’t even feel like celebrating my birthday at this point, this was the only bday celebration I had planned.

I’m in my 20s and I’m getting my PhD. I don’t make a a lot of money from the university and am a typical struggling PhD student and have to work part time as well. It is just me as my cat. I went back home for ten days to visit my parents whom I had not seen in almost a year. When I go back to the US. I always stock up on stuff like snacks and beauty products that I can’t get in the UK. 

Before I really get into it, my parents owed me $1,200 usd for a flight. I helped them out but they assured me when I paid for the flight that they would be paying me back because they know I struggle financially and am doing the best I can with a heavy workload etc. 

When I arrived at my parents house and my mom brought me to the guest bedroom that I’d be staying in she has surprised me with some gifts. This included snacks I liked, some beauty/hair products etc. It was incredibly sweet and I really appreciated it and made sure she really knew that. While at home I also purchased myself a good amount of stuff from target etc… my parents were really nice and took me and my brother out to eat a few times and paid as well which I also thanked them for.


I’ve been back in the UK for over a month and told my mom originally I would need this money back in the coming months to literally just pay my bills and live. She has now informed me numerous times that she does not have the money and is mad that I am even daring to ask for it after all they did for me. Apparently she counts the gifts she got me that I did not ask for but really appreciated as now not needing to pay me any money back. She claims she spent hundreds if not more of me. The situation is very tense and I’m now really upset and feel weird about this whole thing. 

I’ve never asked for anything back after giving someone a gift or taking them out to eat. I was always taught to never aspect anything back… also I brought my parents back so many gifts from the UK. I obviously didn’t ask for money back and never have thought to because that’s weird.

One of my sons (18M) does not and has never wanted to go to college. He’s worked at a fast food restaurant since he was 16, and he really loves his job. He says he wants a future in this business, but that was never the plan. This was only supposed to be a 2 year job before he went to college. He’s been saying that he doesn’t want to go to college, but I don’t want him to miss out on the life experiences and have grief for the rest of his life. We already applied to college last year and he got accepted. He’s set to go in August.

Yesterday, he got promoted to manager at 18 years old. He would be making 60k a year, so he would be able to afford an apartment, a car, and necessities in life (insurance etc). It’s not bad money, but he would have to work 50 hours a week. Including night shifts, 10 hour shifts, and often doing stuff for his job while he’s not on the clock. He was extremely happy, but I don’t want him to work long hours with that kind of pay. I’d rather him go to college and find a good paying job where he can work a 9-5, 40 hours a week, and make pretty good money from that. My son claims it’s useless because if he becomes a general manager, then he’ll make 100k+ a year, but I don’t want him to regret it and feel left out when all his friends go to college except for him.

I won’t go back on this. We worked too hard for him not to go to college. I told him he needs to turn down the promotion, and put in his 2 weeks so he can go to college. He told me he’d pay me back for everything I already payed for, but I was still persistent on him going to college. He then said I was an AH and a controlling person for forcing him to do something he doesn’t want to do, and living through him.

He told me he’d pay me back for everything I already payed for, but I was still persistent on him going to college. He then said I was an AH and a controlling person for forcing him to do something he doesn’t want to do, and living through him.

48,1diyq7e,AITA for not renting a bigger house?,"I currently live in a 2-bedroom apartment that I'm renting. I also own a 3-bedroom house that my ex-wife lives in with our two sons (12 & 8). I also have an older son who is 14.

Currently, my eldest son stays with me every other week and my youngest two are with me every other weekend (plus some extra random days during the week). In my apartment they all share a bedroom; the eldest has a loft bed with his PC and other stuff underneath, and the younger two share a bunk bed. At their mom's homes they each have their own bedroom and although they have issues with sharing at my house, it's only 3-nights every other week.

My girlfriend and I are in the process of moving in together. She has a 5-year-old son. We have found a great home to rent that has 4-bedrooms, a large yard, and is still a reasonable price. 4 bedrooms means that 2 of the boys are going to have to share a bedroom. This is news that didn't go over well with my boys and is still a conundrum we are trying to solve.

The oldest two are closest in age, but arguably the eldest should get their own room. The middle two are the only full siblings but the furthest apart in age (12M is going through puberty) and the most likely to fight with each other. The youngest two are closer in age (2.5 years) and get on pretty well. My 8-year-old likes getting to be big brother for a change but has still been adamantly against sharing room with the 5-year-old.

The bedroom issue has caused problems all-round, even though this is only temporary and I plan on buying a second home in 1-2 years, which will hopefully have enough bedrooms.

Everybody (me, my gf, the kids) has a different opinion about who should share the rooms, but that's not really the point of this post. 12M & 8M were still arguing about bedrooms while at their mom's house and the next time I saw her she chimed in with the opinion that they boys shouldn't have to share. I told her they either have to share with each other or one of them is going to have to share with one of the other boys as the only other option is the 14 and 5-year-old sharing.

She told me I should be renting a bigger house then and I let her know the reason I'm not is because I'm still paying the mortgage on the house she lives in. She told me she knows I could afford to rent a bigger house and I'm being an asshole to the kids just to save a few dollars.

I technically could afford the more expensive rental that would get me 5 bedrooms (and there's literally only 1 option) but I would have to cut costs in other areas and put less towards my savings that are going towards buying a new house. She thinks I should put the kids first and it's unfair to make the boys share when they don't want to especially as I've already ""upended their life multiple times in the last few years"" and they have to adjust to a new girlfriend and her son.

50,1diy5n9,WIBTA if I lied about cost of certain utilities? ,"Sorry this is long, I wanted to include all relevant details. Due to medical issues, I had to move home at 23. At the time, my mom & her bf (John) were looking for a place to move w/ John’s son (Ethan, 13m). We agreed on a house ~15 mins north of my hometown/~45 mins south of my job. Distance-wise it wasn’t fair, but it’s what they could afford. Oh well. Gas/tolls combined w/ rent would be lower than rent alone at my old place. It’s a two-story w/ a finished basement. I got the basement to myself, so I could still have privacy. I started dating my bf about 6 months after moving in here, & a little over a year later, he moved in.

For context, I make the most money, but invest in ESPP & benefits w/ a 401K. I also have a car payment & college debt. My mom/John each make ~60% of what I do. They have way less in expenses, especially since we live 5 miles from their jobs. My bf makes ~1/3 of what I make, & only had car expenses prior to move-in. He’s taking care of a sick family member, so he drives ~90 miles a day. I drive ~60 a day. 

My mom, John, & I had initially split rent & utilities 3 ways. I think John should pay more, since he has Ethan. I know he’s a kid, but even when in school, he’s home the most & runs more on utilities by FAR. But I let it go. Due to his current situation, we all agreed my bf pays ~$500/month & it goes towards home expenses, dog food, etc. I prioritize this money towards basement needs, but still make sure the whole house is covered. We have a basement kitchenette, so it cuts down on food expenses for my mom/John too. Some of my bf’s money covers half the WiFi bill, since we bumped our service to the top tier for his gaming. So, the remaining half is split 3 ways. I’m the account holder for bills except the phone plan (John’s). I add up monthly costs & subtract phone costs from what John owes to make things easy.

The problem is the electricity bill. The top floor isn’t well insulated so it can get really hot or cold, depending on weather, but  especially in summer. Since last year was bad, John got an old window AC unit this year. None of us cared, since it meant we didn’t have to crank central air. But I just received the utility bills, & electricity shot up a LOT. Even with an extra basement heater or 2 for winter, I’ve never seen a bill this high. I do want to pay my fair share, but don’t want to pay this much more just because of their AC unit. It’s only getting hotter, & I’ll be home far less due to major work projects. When I told my family about the cost, they my bf of paying nothing, told him to stop putting money into savings/pay more on bills, & accused us of unnecessarily running our heater. They run the AC constantly even when unnecessary, & Ethan always leaves his lights/TV on. I’ve tried to reason, to no avail.

Her oldest bio kid has a different father to her younger kids. So they have a blended family. My sister's stepkids live with her and her husband and do not see their mom, nor do they see anyone in their mom's family. My BILs family isn't very involved either. My sister's oldest is very close to her dad, her dad's family and to me as well as mine and my sister's parents. 

I'm estranged from my parents and have been for many years so I can't comment a lot on the goings on of those relationships. But I know my sister was fine with them until they refused to treat her stepkids as grandkids, and would buy my sister's oldest gifts but nothing for them. They also made the effort to acknowledge her birthday but not the stepkids. When my sister was pregnant with her second child she told them they needed to treat all the kids the same and they said no. So my sister went no contact with them.

She also had a beef with her ex's parents because she wanted them to remember the other kids in her house and send them something for Christmas at the very least. They didn't want to and she freaked out at them.

My sister's oldest continued to see them because her dad facilitated it. She's still close to them and to her paternal relatives.

Now my sister's oldest is 16 and my sister decided to sit her down and tell her why she went no contact with our parents and why she doesn't like them having a relationship or her. She asked her to cut back on that relationship and her oldest said no and when my sister mentioned her siblings she said she didn't care if they got nothing or had no involved grandparents or extended family except for me. She said it wasn't her problem and she won't throw away her family for stepfamily.

My sister decided to vent to me about this and went from bringing up concerns, to ranting and expressing a lot of anger at our parents but also her ex and his parents. She brought up how they (her ex and his parents) should have done a better job at being decent people and embraced being a very blended extended family and how they should have at least sent the other kids stuff for Christmas or birthdays. She then asked me for my advice and I told her I didn't really have any except maybe speak to a therapist. She asked how I had such bad advice and told me to be honest. So I told her I felt she had very unreasonable expectations when it comes to her ex's parents especially but even her ex.

56,1diwrqo,"AITA for ""making a toddler miserable for spilling some peas"" after my father ignored her to drink","First off, I (18m) have a deep hatred of ball-shaped objects and sticky things. While the ladder is obvious why(though I often feel sick thinking of all the germs and unseen sticky particles left behind on the surfaces i need to touch for up to a day after cleaning) but I have nightmares around small ball-shaped objects frequently and am left feeling ill whenever I look at one.

For the reasons above as well as my dislike needing to clean up after others' messes, I usually avoid my barely managing motor functions niece(1 year and 9 months, Nicole) before and when she eats her favorite food. Now while I clearly DIDN'T put my bag in the kitchen, My father definitely did. He has a habit of making stupid decisions while ignoring the obvious consequences(He insisted on stealing or as he'd say ""indefinitely borrowing"" two of three of my Rubik cubes in my bag for the niece. I told him once he's done, he should put it right back on the couch or else the kid WILL spill it inside of the bag. He, what I believe to be purposely, doesn't answer, feigning mishearing in a tone that suggests he doesn't really want to hear me repeat myself). I didn't want to stay after our conversation, so I left to my room to give us both space.

I was so uncomfortable the whole time. I kept having thoughts of my niece vomiting peas into my bag, having to sort through them to find my things and my dad making fun of me while crying for being upset. I wanted to wait at least 45 minutes so things would cool down but I needed to see what happened to my bag before I tore myself apart so went 10 mins earlier.

When I reached the couch, as I feared, my bag wasn't there. I looked over to my father and noticed a beer in his hand. I angrily left the living room and ran into the kitchen only to see what I'd been picturing in my mind had happened. She wasn't even being supervised, they just left her there. I didn't think and just started yelling. I wasn't in my niece's face or saying anything directed at her but I was angry, saying what came to mind(mostly blaming Dad) and just threw my bag away(I felt sick at the idea of even touching it).

Once I got loud enough, my father said I was ridiculous for hating a toddler to me and demanded I go back to my room for the rest of the day. Am I the asshole for not controlling my temper better?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for ""making a toddler miserable for spilling some peas"" after my father ignored her to drink First off, I (18m) have a deep hatred of ball-shaped objects and sticky things. While the ladder is obvious why(though I often feel sick thinking of all the germs and unseen sticky particles left behind on the surfaces i need to touch for up to a day after cleaning) but I have nightmares around small ball-shaped objects frequently and am left feeling ill whenever I look at one.

For the reasons above as well as my dislike needing to clean up after others' messes, I usually avoid my barely managing motor functions niece(1 year and 9 months, Nicole) before and when she eats her favorite food. Now while I clearly DIDN'T put my bag in the kitchen, My father definitely did. He has a habit of making stupid decisions while ignoring the obvious consequences(He insisted on stealing or as he'd say ""indefinitely borrowing"" two of three of my Rubik cubes in my bag for the niece. I told him once he's done, he should put it right back on the couch or else the kid WILL spill it inside of the bag. He, what I believe to be purposely, doesn't answer, feigning mishearing in a tone that suggests he doesn't really want to hear me repeat myself). I didn't want to stay after our conversation, so I left to my room to give us both space.

I was so uncomfortable the whole time. I kept having thoughts of my niece vomiting peas into my bag, having to sort through them to find my things and my dad making fun of me while crying for being upset. I wanted to wait at least 45 minutes so things would cool down but I needed to see what happened to my bag before I tore myself apart so went 10 mins earlier.

When I reached the couch, as I feared, my bag wasn't there. I looked over to my father and noticed a beer in his hand. I angrily left the living room and ran into the kitchen only to see what I'd been picturing in my mind had happened. She wasn't even being supervised, they just left her there.

57,1diwq6i,AITA for choosing my dream school over being close to my bf?,"For context, me (22F) and bf (30M) have been together for 8 months. Met during my senior year at undergrad and for the last 1-2 months we have been long distance due to job. When we are together, we get along great, but when we are long distance, we argue nearly every day. Note that my grad school is about 3-4 hours away driving from where he resides.

During my senior year, I applied and got accepted into a Master's program at my dream school. I wanted to go there since my freshman year of college and wanted to go to make my family proud too. I knew that grad school is what I need personally to learn and be able to succeed more in my future career. My parents had encouraged me to focus on wrapping up my undergrad and job applications as opposed to getting financial assistance as they would do their best to help, which I have always been very grateful for.

i made this clear to my bf and he was ok with that for a while. Until my parents didn't approve of our relationship and said some hurtful things to me about how I am as a person and who they believe he is as well. They had threatened to disown me at one point and that they will withdraw financial support. As a result, me and my bf looked into alternate options and thought I could still go to that school, but get my degree online instead and to go with him and get a full time job where he is at after the summer is over.

I was completely on board with that until my family came around and told me that even though they don't like my bf, they will still financially support me for my school. This made it hard for me because I want to be close to my bf, but I also want to go to school in person. Online classes are not that great for me I feel like as I tend to not learn as much. However, I felt that maybe I could learn more if I had a full time job with it, if that makes sense. My bf was pushing for me to go online as long distance is hard on us and he wants us to be close together.

When talking to friends about the situation, all of them told me repeatedly to not chose my bf over school, that this school was what I always wanted to go in person to, going in person is better than online and that I'm just starting my life careerwise. I even had talked to bf's mom and she said to pick what makes me happy and to not go based on what her son (my bf) would like as a relationship. She said that he will follow where I go regardless of what I pick. As a result, I ended up picking to go in person to grad school.

Telling my bf this was not easy, but I told him in a couple days ago. He was not very happy about this, but said that he will do his best to work things out with the distance. However, he would say from time to time that I am choosing distance over us and that I could have made things better if I just took the better alternate route of just going online instead.

A few weeks ago i approached some select Friends and my sister Melly to be my bridesmaids. they all accepted and i was very excited, i made a groupchat to send dress inspo for them and me because i wanted to share my plans with my friends. 

the pictures i sent were of a colour palette and styles, i told my bridesmaids to pick a colour and stay sort of within the style of the dresses i thought looked nice and wrote that i would pay for it because i have the means to do so and i thought it would be a nice thing to do. 

my sister is very touchy about money, she doesn’t have a stable job and she often has to ask family members for help with bills etc. for the record i have never judged her for this and i have helped her in the past when needs be. 

Melly saw the message i sent and immediately left the group chat which confused me so i messaged her privately and asked her why she left so abruptly and she said she didn’t need pity money from me, i was really upset that she took my gesture the wrong way and i told her that it wasn’t just for her i was paying for everyones dresses because i wanted to. 

i told her that if she wanted to she could buy her own dress if that made her feel better and she said she didn’t have the money for a dress she would only wear once.

she then rang me and shouted that i was a pompous bitch and all sorts of other expletives. i just told her if she didn’t want to accept my offer then she didn’t have to be a bridesmaid and better yet if she wants to be nasty she can just not come at all. 

her best friend Eliza (33F) rang me and told me that what i said to Melly was so cruel and that i needed to apologise to her or she might never speak to me again.

60,1diwmc2,AITA for not giving a wedding gift to my cousin?,"I (28F) have a cousin (26F) who was recently married. Our grandfathers were brothers so I think that makes us second cousins. We were never particularly close but would hang out at family gatherings maybe 1-2 times a year. I met her husband twice (grandpas birthday party and then his funeral). I haven’t met her 1.5 yr old son. She was always great with reaching out between all us cousins. We have a large family and maybe 15 of us second cousins all within a 5 year age range. I’ll admit I never was great with meeting up with them. I live about 3 hours away. 

Anyhow, over the past 2 years, my cousin invited me to her baby shower, baby’s christening, bridal shower, baby’s 1st birthday, and wedding. Due to distance, work, and grad school, I couldn't attend any. I planned to attend her bridal shower but got Covid and had to cancel, though I sent gifts:

Baby shower - I sent a children’s book, $100 check, and diapers (all requested) via FedEx so I could track it. No thank you received.
Baby’s Christening - I sent a card and $100 check. No thank you received.
Bridal shower - I bought a $120 registry gift. No thank you received.
Baby’s 1st birthday - I bought a $75 registry gift. No thank you received.

At this point I’ve spent over $400 on presents and never received a thank you card or even a thank you text! I’m fortunate to be in a financial situation where I’m okay sending those amounts and it’s customary/expected in my family. I understand I didn’t attend any of these events but I still feel I deserve a thank you. She has my address to send these invites by mail so it’s not that. She’s texted me in between and she’s cashed each of my checks. So when her wedding invite came I notified her immediately that I wouldn’t be able to attend due to classes. I chose not to send her a wedding gift because she never thanked me for any of it. But now  I’ve been feeling conflicted. 

I spoke to my mom about it recently and she told me it was wrong of me and that I should just send her a check now, apologize and say it was sent back in the mail to me. I don’t want to but maybe I’m overreacting. So Reddit, AITA?

63,1divkih,AITA not wanting my sick father to live with me?,"To start off with, the title sounds horrible. But let me explain. My father was abusive growing up, physically, emotionally, and mentally. 

He was an alcoholic almost my entire life; once my mother passed away at the age of nine, he got to his breaking point and just gave up being a parent. 

He was emotionally absent, but paid the bills, so in his mind, he was a great father, but even though the bills were paid, most of the time we didn’t have any food, I didn’t have health insurance, nor dental, so as a child I was neglected.

There were times where certain points my dad was a father, we possibly had a couple conversations where I felt happy, but now as an adult, I realize how that I have made excuses, and was actually the parent more than the child.

Once I was 17 or 18 I moved out and began to try to stay away. When I was 19 I moved back for a brief time, but finally moved out a couple months after as the alcoholism was as bad as it’s ever been.

Fast forward to 24 years old, and I receive a call from my fathers best friend (who is the greatest man I’ve had in my life other than my husband), and he informs me my father is in the hospital. For context, I am in the military, and text my dad briefly and found out two weeks ago he was thinking of going. 

Well apparently he’s in the hospital, with all his stuff packed in a car, and moved out of the motel he was living in (he’s been there for almost two years) and planned on basically trying to get a place with me 3,000 miles away. 

I have concluded that if he’s dying (they assume he may have cancer) that I could help him, but I’m unsure if I would want to, and just rather put him into a home if worst comes to worst. 

However, I was going to help him get on his feet if he was going to get better, but I come to realize my boundaries were being taken advantage of and I was resorting back to the parental figure for my father.

He’s always wanted someone to take care of him since he had absent parents as well, but I am his child and I felt that this isn’t my responsibility.

64,1div8q0,AITA for texting my ex-boyfriend? ,"My ex-boyfriend and I broke up around two years ago after dating for over four years. We were talking off and on for a while but got into a fight about a year ago that made us go no-contact. I truly believe this is for the best as I don't think us being a relationship made sense anymore, and this was the only way to ensure that we can both move on with our lives. We do have a lot of mutual friends, but most of them have been able to juggle friendships with both of us and there haven't really been that many issues. Last October, he got a new girlfriend. I have nothing negative to say about her, I haven't met her and really don't know much about her. I would like to meet her eventually as him and I do have mutual friends and I assume at some point we will all have to be in the same room again so I would like it if we could all just be neutral if not friendly.

Recently, and this is where I might be the asshole, my grandma passed away. My ex and her were close, and obviously in each other's lives for a decent amount of time. I thought long and hard about whether or not to tell him, and finally decided to because I would like to know if anything happened to his grandparents as again, I had a good relationship with them for multiple years. Since we're no contact, and I don't even have his phone number anymore, I decided to message him on Instagram. We don't follow each other anymore, so I figured it would go into his message requests and he would either see it and respond or he wouldn't. I truly didn't even want/need a response, I just felt a sort of obligation to let him know the information. I think my message was pretty normal. I mentioned that I didn't want to be disrespectful to him and his new relationship in any way, but I just wanted to let him know that she passed away. I also explicitly said that he doesn't need to even respond, and that I just felt like he should know.

He responded very quickly and said that he appreciated me telling him and that he was really sorry. I liked the message and thought that's that. However, because we had messaged, I had the conversation in my Instagram dm's and then noticed that one day it disappeared. This was several weeks after we had spoken so I was really confused to see that he had blocked me seemingly out of no where. I am worried now that I overstepped and made his new girlfriend mad/uncomfortable. This truly was never my intention; I understand that if they continue dating that we will eventually be attending weddings and other events together and truly all I want is for things to just be neutral.

I think she has every right to be upset about her boyfriend's ex-girlfriend messaging him on Instagram, but I would think after looking at the actual content of the messages she would realize it was really nothing. Am I the asshole?",No A-holes here,2024-06-18,"AITA for texting my ex-boyfriend?  My ex-boyfriend and I broke up around two years ago after dating for over four years. We were talking off and on for a while but got into a fight about a year ago that made us go no-contact. I truly believe this is for the best as I don't think us being a relationship made sense anymore, and this was the only way to ensure that we can both move on with our lives. We do have a lot of mutual friends, but most of them have been able to juggle friendships with both of us and there haven't really been that many issues. Last October, he got a new girlfriend. I have nothing negative to say about her, I haven't met her and really don't know much about her. I would like to meet her eventually as him and I do have mutual friends and I assume at some point we will all have to be in the same room again so I would like it if we could all just be neutral if not friendly.

Recently, and this is where I might be the asshole, my grandma passed away. My ex and her were close, and obviously in each other's lives for a decent amount of time. I thought long and hard about whether or not to tell him, and finally decided to because I would like to know if anything happened to his grandparents as again, I had a good relationship with them for multiple years. Since we're no contact, and I don't even have his phone number anymore, I decided to message him on Instagram. We don't follow each other anymore, so I figured it would go into his message requests and he would either see it and respond or he wouldn't. I truly didn't even want/need a response, I just felt a sort of obligation to let him know the information. I think my message was pretty normal. I mentioned that I didn't want to be disrespectful to him and his new relationship in any way, but I just wanted to let him know that she passed away. I also explicitly said that he doesn't need to even respond, and that I just felt like he should know.

He responded very quickly and said that he appreciated me telling him and that he was really sorry. I liked the message and thought that's that. However, because we had messaged, I had the conversation in my Instagram dm's and then noticed that one day it disappeared. This was several weeks after we had spoken so I was really confused to see that he had blocked me seemingly out of no where. I am worried now that I overstepped and made his new girlfriend mad/uncomfortable. This truly was never my intention; I understand that if they continue dating that we will eventually be attending weddings and other events together and truly all I want is for things to just be neutral. I'm wondering if I overstepped in messaging him at all?

65,1div44s,AITA for “purposefully antagonising” my SIL?,"I (19M) recently moved in with my sister (30F) and her wife (23F) they've been together for 3 years, can call SIL ""Darcey"" just to keep this clear.

Darcey is chill, funny and artistic and we usually get along well, she's a teacher. 

Well as I said I moved in with my sister and SIL, there's been a few things I'd noticed 

Darcey has her own cutlery and plates, nobody can touch them.

Darcey has a specific area in the living room she sits in, a specific space on the sofa - she will not sit anywhere else.

Darcey always has to have the same thing playing on tv as she eats her dinner; she'll skip through any bits that make her anxious...it's the simpsons.

Well there's been a few instances where I've sat in her seat or had the tv already on, and she won't expect me to move or change the tv she just won't sit in the room...she's never complained my sister has said Darcey finds it extremely upsetting, like an itch under her skin that she can't stop thinking about.

My point of view is Darcey hasn't said this to me, and I think it's blown out of proportion- my sister claims I'm ""purposefully antagonising"" Darcey, I don't think I am for just sitting somewhere and watching tv.

My mother is on my side, my father is saying for the sake of peace to just move since it's Darceys place in the first place, my friends say it's no big deal since Darcey hasn't spoken to me herself.

66,1div1ek,WIBTA if I insist on finding out if I have a half brother?,"
Just recently, my dad received a message from a man claiming to be his son.  This man (let’s call him Jay) says that he has always known my dad to be his father, but only recently had enough interest and courage to reach out. My dad joined the military shortly after graduating high school, and apparently Jay was conceived either before my dad left for bootcamp, or during one his trips back home. (This was a few years before my parents met.) Jay said that his mom told him that she had told my dad about the pregnancy at the time, or shortly after Jay was born.

 

My dad says he has no memory of this and doesn’t even remember the woman. He says it could be possible he got some pregnant, but he swears that he had no idea and that this news blindsided him. I do believe my dad when he says he had no idea - he is just not the type of person who would have abandoned a child. The only reason he leaves open the possibility is because this was 40ish years ago, so he doesn’t fully remember the time.

 

Jay just says he wants some communication (he doesn’t want to suddenly become family) and to do a DNA test to be sure. My dad thought about it awhile but ended up basically “rebuffing” the offer, which apparently Jay reluctantly but graciously accepted. However, while my dad/parents don’t want to, I do want to know if he’s my half-brother. I’m not sure if I’m open to any kind of relationship, but I’d like to know for sure if he is blood related. I asked my parents for Jay’s information, but they refuse to give it to me, and it’s been causing a huge fight. They believe that it’s basically not my business.

71,1diu7gv,AITA for not Loaning Money to My Parents,"I (32, M) have been living with my parents (both 50+) since the pandemic when I was evicted from my apartment. It's been a struggle to find somewhere new to live when your old rent was $700 and new average rent is $1200. As such, I have been saving money to put a down payment on a small sized home.

As this has to do with money, I should mention my parents refuse to accept rent, even when offered, but I pay for groceries, phone, internet, and car repairs when needed.

A few years back, my brother (42, M) began a business venture, but before he even began it I honestly questioned if he could be an owner. I saw my brother as too passive and he always tried to keep everyone else happy over himself, and could not make decisions on his own. 

Despite me being open about my opinion, my parents lent my brother the money he needed to begin his business venture, becoming joint owners. I made it known I did not want anything to do with the business, though I welcomed my brother to prove me wrong. As dumb as this sounded to me, I still wanted him to succeed. 

This drained my parents' bank account, though I was not exactly sure how severe it was. Over the course of the next three years, my brother had been making questionable business decisions, and he, our parents, the bookkeeper and brother’s GF (Age Unknown) have constantly disagreed on how the business should be run. It got to the point where I considered fronting the money for a show like Restaurant Impossible or Bar Rescue to come talk sense into everyone as the only thing the family talks about now is how the business is failing.

A few days ago I learned just how severe the situation was. My father took me out for dinner and asked me for a $60k loan. He would sign the family house over to me until it was paid off. The $60k would pay off the loan my parents took out to start my brother’s Business, rent, and some other things.

Quote from my dad: “I am in a tunnel, and I don’t see a light. I am asking you for help because I want a light at the end of the tunnel.”

When he asked for that money, I told him the truth. I said I cannot in good conscience lend him the money when I told him this was going to happen, especially when I want to use that money to get a new house or apartment.

I asked him instead how much it would be to file for bankruptcy and he told me about $15k. I told him I would lend him that much, but $60k was out of the question. The conversation was painful, I’m only giving the cliff notes.

For the past week or so, my parents have been acting cold, and my brother isn’t responding to any more texts or messages. When I asked my dad if this was about the loan he said “You said no, and that's the end of it. I’ll find some other way.”

I feel like I am letting down the family, especially if they were desperate enough to come to me who can’t even find an affordable house, but at the same time I can’t just give that up so that maybe my brother’s business would survive.

So, Reddit, AITA?

Edit for INFO: House is paid off, but the house is being held as collateral for the loan. The $60k would have been used to pay off the loan to prevent further interest from building up.

73,1ditwhb,WIBTA if I host a baby shower for one cousin and not the other?,"I (23f) want to host a baby shower for my cousin ( let’s call her Lucy ). She is pregnant with her 4th child and it’s her first girl, so everyone was really excited and happy. 

I have another cousin ( let’s call her Tania ) who is pregnant with her second child and is much far along than Lucy. Both Tania and Lucy had a baby shower for their first child, Tania had hers around a year ago and Lucy had her one over 10 years ago. 

I should also mention that Lucy’s pregnancy was unplanned and that from the beginning she struggled a lot. So hopefully this baby shower will cheer her up and let her know that we are all here for her. 
Lucy’s sister contacted me privately and told me that she feels bad because we are hosting a shower for Lucy and not Tania, even though they are both pregnant. I was going to suggest hosting one for both of them but that seems insincere.

75,1ditvo6,AITA for finding someone to take over my lease because I can no longer afford it?,"Some context, I’m currently in college and am living in an apartment with two other roommates. We signed a two year lease and at the time they knew my financial struggles and agreed to let me have the cheapest room. I was able to afford this because my school gives good financial aid and all of my tuition was covered. However, I just got my financial aid package back a few days ago to find out that I now have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition on top of my rent. Not only can my family not afford this, but to make matters worse I recently have two relatives with cancer, one who is terminal. My parents are having to fly to visit them which is not cheap, and i’m sure more costs will come with the funeral. Overall, my parents are really stressed right now and I feel bad putting this on them.

To help me out, my boyfriend said I could live with him free of charge until we graduate next year. I had already been living with him like 95% of the time anyways so I was barely at my apartment. I talked to my landlord (who is so amazing) about this and he said that if I could find someone to take over my lease, then he is happy to let me go from the lease agreement. Well, I found someone and brought it up to my roommates. But they are both really pissed off because they don’t want to live with a stranger for this next year. They said they won’t let me move out unless I can find one of THEIR friends to take my place. First, this is stressing me out because most people have found housing by now and me finding this person who was willing to take over the lease and goes to our school (our school is pretty small) was already incredibly lucky. Second, I think they are setting this requirement because they already know none of their friends need housing. 

My landlord has OK’d me moving out and breaking the lease so I know that at the end of the day my financial situation matters more to me than their comfort. But it makes me feel like a shitty person. So i guess Im wondering if I am the AH in this situation if I break lease and move out for the sake of my financial situation and prioritize myself over their comfort.

Then a few weeks after my birthday she  sends me a txt saying she bought the wrong insurance for her flight and it didn’t cover cancellations. She said since she didn’t go on the trip could I take the 350.00 off the price of trailer.  This is 5 MONTHS later!  I responded that I didn’t quite understand what she was asking and questioned her about buying the wrong insurance and why was she filing the claim 5 months later. 
I said if she didn’t want the trailer I have other people interested. Her response was sell it to someone else and she was sorry about my horse… BUT she was out a lot of money and the cancellation had impacted her and screwed things up on her end. 
I’m not sure how her not buying cancellation insurance is my problem. She still could have gone on vacation.

I’ve been here for almost six months and have been telling her to take time off and sent her an agenda of what we could do. I put a lot of thought and planning into it and of course because I make more than her, I’d be covering all the bills including food, hotel (it’s a big place so some days she’d be staying with me and some days we’d be in hotels), etc. She kept delaying the date initally and then kept saying that she ”forgot to take time off”. So I stopped pushing thinking she might not be comfortable taking too much time off yet or she might not even be that interested in coming.

Lo and behold today she tells me that she bought flights and then corrects that well actually her new boyfriend bought the tickets and he’s coming too and if that’s okay? 

I can’t say ”no it’s actually not okay, you should have asked me first and also this was supposed to be a girls trip”. But i don’t want to do the trip the way I wanted to right now because I’d have to 1) have this guy I don’t know and never met stay at my place 2) pay for his accommodations.

A year ago, I moved into a new city due to my dad moving jobs, and in my new school in this new city, I found Khalid. Khalid is amazing, I love him, the only problem is his friend, who we'll call Philip.

So, as I was worried for Hannah, I told my childhood best friend all about Philip and what kind of person he is based on what I've been hearing from my new friends at this school. In the middle of this conversation, I brought in Philip's best friend, Leon in a sentence to further prove my point. In this specific sentence, I said ""Apparently, this guy (Leon) vapes AND is a playboy"". My childhood best friend then went to tell Philip about our conversation and Philip spread it to Leon and the other friends in the friend group. Of course, they weren't happy at all about it and started spreading rumours and attempting to brainwash Khalid into breaking up with me. Best part is, they weren't even mad on behalf of Philip (like I said, he's only just somewhat part of the friend group), they were mad on behalf of Leon. And, of course, I found it kind of ridiculous. It's been MONTHS (started early this year) and they're now, till this day, still on my hate train.

English is not my first language, sorry. 

I have a friend (David, 30M) who I have been friends with for 2 years. At the same time I (28M) met him, I had just broken up with my ex. After that, I worked a lot and didn't start any new relationships with girls. 

Six months ago I finally met a girl (F29) that I want to be together with. David wants to meet her and even be a witness at the wedding, but I am against it. 

Here's the problem. David is a real womanizer, but he is most interested in married girls. He says the more faithful a girl is to her husband, the more pleasant it is to ""win"" her. Several times his girls' husbands have caught him and Was very angry at him  , but he keeps doing it. He bragged about getting a priest's wife once. 

I think a wedding ring on a girl's finger is like a red rag on a bull. 

No wonder why I don't want my girlfriend to meet him, huh? David has been asking me for six months why I don't want to introduce him to my girlfriend, after all, he and I are close friends, he wants to be my wedding witness. 

I didn't want to tell him so David wouldn't take offense. But a couple of days ago, when David started asking me again why I didn't introduce him to my girlfriend, I couldn't stand it and told him the reason. 

David was  upset. He says he would never do that to me, because I'm his friend. He says he didn't care about the feelings of his girlfriends' husbands because he wasn't familiar with them. I'm different. 
David asked if I don't trust him or my girlfriend, but I don't know what to say.

86,1dirn5s,AITA for not talking to my best friends anymore,"So I (15) met my previous best friend Katherine (16) about 3 years ago when we were in 7th grade. We hit it off pretty much immediately not suprising considering we were both kind of chubby and basically your typical nerdy secondary school girls. We had so much in common that we ended up becoming almost like sisters but there was always an underlying sense of resentment I guess on my end at least.
Now before you pass judgement I would like it to be known why I felt this way. See I wad bullied for pretty much most of my school years- it was especially bad in my old school. I was very different from my classmates, since my family moved to an asian country when I was a kid (my mom is Canadian and my dad is chinese) and I just never learned to speak the language (mandarin) so when my classmates and friends would talk in their language I wouldn't be able to understand them and naturally it felt well bad. Not to mention whenever I brought it up they always made me feel like shit so eventually I stopped. Plus I was the only one who wasn't skinny among the girls and they teased me- like a lot and they just always made me feel like I was unlikeable so it ended up making me pretty insecure. 
So back to the story of me and Katherine, she and I were so alike that we had all the same hobbies and interests pretty much. But I was always thinking that she was better than me becuase well everyone always praised her for everything. She was just that type of girl always laughing and smiling and trying to make everyone like her. 
But one thing about Katherine was she was a bit too concerned with making people like her. Like I remember whenever we fought she would cry even if all I did was gently say how she made me feel uncomfortable or sad. Inevitably it always ended the same way, with people giving me nasty looks that basically did all the talking for them 'why would you make her cry.' In fact in 8th grade there was a birthday party and everyone else in my class was invited except me and what did my best friend do ? She purposefully hid it from me becuase they told her too. And then I didn't know for sure but I suspected something was going on so I asked her if she wanted to go out on that day and sure enough she told me she had a 'family thing'. I had to find out from her sister, who I also happened to be friends with- and that only happened because she forgot to keep it from me. Then when I confronted her she ended up crying and making a big scene in the middle of class and once again I looked like a jerk. Afterwards when we talked about it privately she even said to me 'what did you want me to do? Stay home and be bored like you?' The tip of the iceberg though was when I fell head over heals for this guy- he was nice, handsome and it actually seemed like he liked me and I told my best friend about me liking him and she was all understanding, listening to me talking about how much I liked him- then at the end of the year he had a falling out with a male mutual friend and both of the boys stopped talking to both me and Katherine. Eventually when they patched up their relationship, it seemed like he had moved on and didn't have any feelings for me in the slightest anymore- which hurt like a bitch but I still liked him. Katherine of course knew this but seemed to completely disregard my feelings and started to be close friends with him and I had told her that I was kind of uncomfortable with their closeness but it's like I was speaking another language to her. Then whenever it came up in our friend group I was made to be the bad guy.
So fast forward a year we were in year 10 and we met a girl who transferred to our school, Sandra and I wanted to make sure she felt included so I made friends with her and Katherine did as well. Eventually it became the three of us instead of two and it was great for a bit.
Until year 11 rolled around and I started to feel left out, plus I had so much pressure from my family to do well and they had been so disappointed- they said they expected me to get at least an A in every subject. This left me scared about what would happen if I didn't do well, stressed about my future and pretty much just in a panic. So what did my hormonal, stressed and panicked teenage brain decide wad the best course of action ? Cut them off, this was at the time rational as they were the type of girls to prioritise school events, and socialising over actual learning. Like I'm talking going out every weekend, doing homework the day it's due. So I decided I couldn't take it anymore I stopped talking to them and blocked them, moved my seat and pretty much became a loner. At least I had my previous friends let's call them Amy and Kayla, but one had graduated and one had left so as of now I am stuck in a horrible situation utterly alone all day in class and especially during school events. It also doesn't help that they never tried to talk to me about why I was pulling away or try to understand my side of things.

87,1dir9j6,WIBTA: For Ruining My Sisters Wedding,"My sister is getting married in September. Her fiancé is great fella, love him and her and am pretty stoked they are getting married. In fact, I'm going to be officiating the ceremony. Big thanks to American Marriage Ministries.

One of the first things my sister told me after they got engaged was that her nephews and niece need to be in the wedding. This was about a year ago at this point. I'm a Dad to my 2 year old son and 3 month old daughter who will be 6 months old at the wedding.  I thought this was a super cute idea however, I have kids and know how unpredictable little people are. She doesn't have kids yet so I and my wife separately kind of gave her the lowdown on possible issues with including such young kids in the wedding. She totally gets it and has no issues with the calamities that may ensue.

Here is the issue. When my kids are at her wedding there is a possibility that we may not be able to stay for the whole wedding reception. We are certainly going to try to stay for as long as possible but a toddler having a tantrum because they are tired is no fun for anyone to be around. I try to be pretty mindful of my children's impact on the people around them out of respect for other people, but it's not always easy, sorry general public.

The fact that we may leave early has my sister right sideways. She cannot believe that I would even consider leaving early and thinks its going to ruin the day. Her opinion is that we should get a baby sister to come to the wedding venue to pickup our children and take them away after dinner. We have told her that this isn't super practical. For the non-parents out there, little people ride and cars seats. Installing a car seats is a terrible experience and I can't imagine trying to do that in the parking lot of a wedding venue. The wedding venue is about 15 miles from where we live, feels a little far for a sitter to drive anyway. 

Some other information is that my wife's family is not reliable and my wife and I do not trust her family to watch the kids or come get them from the venue. Any baby sitter option would be outside of the family. I think I WIBTA if she had made the wedding child free and we refused to cooperate. In my opinion though she was the one who wanted the kids there so there they will be.

88,1dir8ci,AITA for demanding my final 2 weeks pay and annul leave after my boss fired me ,"i worked in fast food 

my boss fired me for taking left over food home when he never said we could not take any of the left over food home (it gets thrown out at the end of the day). it all started because i asked if i would be entitled to a pay rise if i did a barista course since we made coffee and hot drinks. He left me on opened and never replied to anything else I said to him (that was work related). 3 days later he fired me without any warning. i went back the next day to get my pay since he payed the employee's in cash and my pay wasn't there so i messaged him asking when do i get my pay, to which he never replied of course.

 He messaged me a few days later saying that he'll  pay me but i must come between 1pm and 3:30pm no later as he had things to do. I went to collect my pay and had my boyfriend come with me, to which he told my boyfriend to leave as he wanted to talk to me alone, my boyfriend told my ex boss that he wasn't going to leave as he could tell that i was uncomfortable, to which my ex boss said ""you can come back later when your willing to talk to me alone if you want to get part of your pay"" and then proceeded to slam the door in my face.

i didn't know what to do for the next few days then i decided to call up Fairworks on the following Monday (everything that previously happened was within the last 2 weeks) to which they told me to write a letter of demand, demanding my 2 weeks pay and my annual leave that i have accumulated over the time that i worked for him which totaled out to about $2700. I wrote the letter of demand and sent it to on the Thursday which was exactly 2 weeks after being fired. he had 5 days to pay me everything that he owed me as per the legal laws behind the letter of demand in my country. he then proceeded to ignore the letter of demand only paying me 1 weeks pay 7 days after the letter of demand was sent to him. before he actually payed me that 1 weeks pay he proceeded to yell at me for roughly 5 minutes, which within that time a civilian called security over who then came over and saw my ex boss yelling at me then slamming the door in my face before getting my pay and handing it to me not before telling me that he wont be giving me my annual leave for an few weeks as i apparently stated an amount which was way higher that what its actually was.

Its currently been 5 days since that all happened I'm still waiting for my annual leave pay and I'm not sure what to do.

I went to collect my pay and had my boyfriend come with me, to which he told my boyfriend to leave as he wanted to talk to me alone, my boyfriend told my ex boss that he wasn't going to leave as he could tell that i was uncomfortable, to which my ex boss said ""you can come back later when your willing to talk to me alone if you want to get part of your pay"" and then proceeded to slam the door in my face.

i didn't know what to do for the next few days then i decided to call up Fairworks on the following Monday (everything that previously happened was within the last 2 weeks) to which they told me to write a letter of demand, demanding my 2 weeks pay and my annual leave that i have accumulated over the time that i worked for him which totaled out to about $2700. I wrote the letter of demand and sent it to on the Thursday which was exactly 2 weeks after being fired. he had 5 days to pay me everything that he owed me as per the legal laws behind the letter of demand in my country. he then proceeded to ignore the letter of demand only paying me 1 weeks pay 7 days after the letter of demand was sent to him. before he actually payed me that 1 weeks pay he proceeded to yell at me for roughly 5 minutes, which within that time a civilian called security over who then came over and saw my ex boss yelling at me then slamming the door in my face before getting my pay and handing it to me not before telling me that he wont be giving me my annual leave for an few weeks as i apparently stated an amount which was way higher that what its actually was.

Its currently been 5 days since that all happened I'm still waiting for my annual leave pay and I'm not sure what to do.

89,1diqp1h,AITA for taking my little cousin to a pool hall instead of bowling alley.,"So my uncle and dad basically just walked into my apartment and said ""kyle you're watching him, go to a bowling or something"" then walked off.

And I'm just sitting there looking at this 9 year old boy (I'm 17 fyi) and I'm just like. 

Ok I guess.

I didn't feel like bowling and more like playing pool.

Drove around the corner to the pool hall that's about as family friendly as a mid bowling alley.

So a few hours later we went back and his dad showed up.

Found out I took him to a pool ball.

Matt has some sort of condition in his spine that he had surgery for a while back, but he still has flare ups every now and then. During the flare ups he is in immense pain and can barely walk.

Zoe had a competition and the day before it Matt stayed over. He was having an especially nasty flare up, and I didn’t have a lot of options.

Of course Zoe was upset. She said that I didn’t have to bail out on her because of Matt and that she felt lonely and betrayed. I explained to her that I really wanted to go, but unfortunately Matt had a medical emergency and I prioritized him because he is a part of our family too and hopefully my future son in law.

91,1diqid8,AITA for walking away from my FILs wife after she spoke negatively about my wife during my SILs wedding?,"My wife's younger sister got married three weeks ago. For the wedding my wife filled the role that should have been filled by their mom but she passed away when my wife was a teenager and her siblings were younger again and my wife stepped up as the family mom. It ruined her relationship with her dad in the process because she had to mother him as well and had to take care of the family. She wanted him to be a better dad than that but he was not capable at the time. To this day things are strained. My wife's siblings lived with her for a period of time after she left as well.

There is some conflict about this because after my wife turned 18 and moved out, her dad got remarried. There has always been a tension between my wife and FILs wife over the role my wife plays and the role FILs wife wanted to play. My wife's younger siblings did not end up looking to FILs wife as a maternal figure and instead continued looking to my wife. This is something we all know bothers FILs wife, at least to some degree.

This is why my SILs decision to have my wife fill the role on her wedding day brought forth some comments from FILs wife. It was more about the tradition they do in their family, which may or may not be related to a cultural thing in their mom's family. But their family always has the bride spend the night before and right up until the wedding with her mom. They don't leave each other's sides and they help each other get ready together. My wife did this with her sister.

FILs wife wanted to be a part of this. She was upset previously when my wife didn't invite her to do it for our wedding. But it was a bigger deal with SIL because they lived for 6/7 years.

FILs wife found me during an in-between moment and she told me my wife must be so happy she got to keep her out of yet another one of the weddings, and how smug my wife must be that she wasn't thought of enough to be invited in alongside the two sisters and was basically a plus one and nothing more. I told her I did not appreciate her talking about my wife in that way and she started to make another comment so I walked away from her without saying another word.

She stewed on that for the rest of the wedding and days later brought it up to my ILs and demanded an apology from me. My wife told her I did not owe her an apology for walking away in the way in which I did.

93,1diptsl,AITA for not letting my father see my son.,"My father (60) and I (28) have been fighting for a few years now but things came to a head when he and his wife called my wife a prostitute and that my first born son isn't even mine because of how much of a whore my wife is ect. Now my father is getting a divorce and wants to patch things up between us, I told him for that to happen he would have to apologize to me and my wife. When I said this his response was ""apologize for what?"" Now this genuinely infuriated me and I'm not pround to admit this but I cursed him out and told him that he was not being sincere about wanting to patch things up. According to him because of the fighting and that I had called his ex-wife of gold digger it was totally justified for him and his wife to say whatever they wanted to about my wife and that there's no need to apologize. I told him that I still stood by the fact that his ex-wife was a gold digger but if he wanted to patch things up and see my son he would have to apologize to my wife. This whole thing became a huge fight where he would not acknowledge the need to apologize whatsoever. 
Now before I hung up my father he told me he was being an asshole for not trying to patch things up with him. Interestingly enough when I brought this up to some of my family they told me that I should patch things up and forget about all of that, and that I'm being an asshole.

So am I the asshole for not wanting to patch things up if my father won't apologize for calling my wife a prostitute and the insinuating that my son isn't my son?

Apparently his ex did not like that idea and went around and told my entire extended family that I was trying to stop the wedding because all I wanted was his money and inheritance. Now this really pissed me off because I didn't even know who this woman was and I was being accused of trying to stop a wedding just for money by my entire family, so I called my father up and told him that his wife was behaving like a gold digger.

94,1dipsey,AITA for leaving my own graduation party. ,"So I just finished up school and my family threw a big party for me. I invited my friends and my boyfriend. I was super excited, but I was told one of my cousins who I cannot stand is coming. She tends to outshine me in anything. My GPA was a 3.95 so I was in Cum Laude. So she decided to become just like me and graduated Magna Cum Laude. 

So I tell my dad that I do not feel comfortable with her coming as she tends to make it about herself and ruins the moment. He said “oh she changed don’t worry” I just nodded and went to the store to get party supplies. 

So the night before my party comes around. All my family is here for dinner. My aunt asks me “what is Cum Laude.” And I begin to answer but my cousin goes “it’s the lowest of the smart people. (My name) should’ve gotten Magna Cum Laude like I did. That just shows I’m smarter than her!!” I rolled my eyes and left the table. I didn’t even finish my food. 
After a little bit my stepsister comes in and says “hey I can’t stand her either. That was wrong of her. Did you tell dad?” I said “no because he said she changed, but she’s still acting like a child and making it about herself.” My stepsister decided to stay in my room for a little and we just talked. 

As I was getting ready, my cousin comes in and says “hey I have that dress but it’s better than yours. See?” I ignored her. She walked out and yelled “(my name) is smoking!!” Which I am not because I am simply sitting at my vanity doing my makeup. No one listened because everyone in your family knows I don’t mess with any drugs. I drive over to the venue with my boyfriend and we begin to set up. The party starts at 3:45. We finish setting up by 3:30. My cousin was in my backseat messing with me and I didn’t know. “come on (cousins name) that isn’t funny at all. You’re messed up and you shouldn’t have done that.” She put a balloon with dyed shaving cream on my pants. I walk in and everyone says “I thought you were here?” I said “no I just had to take care of something” then that is when I turned my head. My cousin was wearing my dress, my heels, and my graduation sash my mom had bought me. I had all that in a bag in my trunk. I start crying and i run out. 

My day was ruined by my cousin all because she wanted it to be all about her. So I left. Had dinner with my friends who didn’t come because of my cousin and of course my boyfriend. My family called me immature and self centered for leaving, but I just read the texts and ignored.

One of my brothers ‘Ricardo’ (17M) has this friend that none of us like ‘Brandon’ (17M). Ricardo is a good looking Dominican boy, so Brandon is always making remarks about his ethnicity and looks. It’s subliminal bullying from what I see. Ricardo is often hanging around this boy, and I hate that for him. He’s quirky, jealous, hateful, annoying, and selfish. 

Well one day, I came home from work at 8pm, and I saw Ricardo sitting on the couch heavily sobbing, and trying to hide his tears from me. He doesn’t normally cry like that, so I knew it must’ve been serious. I immediately sat down and put a supportive arm around him, and I asked what happened. He said that him and Brandon got into a huge argument. Ricardo confronted Brandon for how fake he is, and Brandon told him to “smoke your dead grandmothers ashes”. Our grandmother had recently just passed away last month, so it poured salt on an open wound. 

After hearing this, I was very angry with Brandon. I was under the impression that this interaction happened over the phone, but Ricardo told me that it happened in person and Brandon was still upstairs. That’s apparently why he was downstairs crying, to hide his tears from Brandon. I went right upstairs to Ricardo’s room where Brandon was sitting on his bed, and I told Brandon that he has no right to talk to my brother like that, and he needs to leave and never come back. Me and Brandon had a short back and forth until he said he’d leave, but he claims he didn’t have a ride. I offered to call an UBER for him, I just wanted him out of my house. Brandon rejected the offer for an Uber and left at 8pm at night to walk home. 

After then, I took Ricardo to get ice cream to lift up his spirits. Well the next day, Brandon’s mother came up to our house, and she went off on me for letting a 17 year old boy walk home at night. I informed her that I offered to call an Uber for him, but she thinks that either Ricardo or I should’ve taken him home. I told her that we aren’t taking him home when he insulted our dead grandmother. Plus I had just gotten off a 12 hour shift.

Sarah has always struggled with relationships- and by this I mean the men she chooses. From my POV- most of them have had big red flags above their head, but Sarah looked past them or basically made excuses for them. Then- when chaos ensues, Sarah is shocked and bewildered that this person did something like this to her and feels confused/like she has bad luck. Where from my standpoint, these relationships were clearly doomed from the start. I also think, knowing how Sarah is and how sensitive she is, I try to keep my advice on the lighter, nicer side Sarah has always had it tough in her home life/relationships with her family/parents. I feel that led to a very clingy attachment style in relationships, and lower self esteem/self worth. Sarah wants the perfect relationship and to get a house and have kids and she seems like she's rushing these things even if it's not a good time or a good guy. Moving along here- Sarah(28) has been dating someone, let's call him Jake(21). She met him at work/he would come over her dads house to eat, play games together. After a month or so, Sarah would complain about how annoyed she is that Jake needs a ride everywhere, can't keep a job, doesn't give her space, plays loud bright video games right next to her all night long while she's trying to sleep for school/work, and isn't considerate to her.

I can't see how anything could be better, but I'm not in the relationship and I don't know what Jake is telling her.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-18,"AITA for potentially not attending my best friend of 20 years’ wedding?  My best friend, let's call her Sarah, and I tell each other things no one else knows/often go to one another to vent or get advice. Sarah has always struggled with relationships- and by this I mean the men she chooses. From my POV- most of them have had big red flags above their head, but Sarah looked past them or basically made excuses for them. Then- when chaos ensues, Sarah is shocked and bewildered that this person did something like this to her and feels confused/like she has bad luck. Where from my standpoint, these relationships were clearly doomed from the start. I also think, knowing how Sarah is and how sensitive she is, I try to keep my advice on the lighter, nicer side Sarah has always had it tough in her home life/relationships with her family/parents. I feel that led to a very clingy attachment style in relationships, and lower self esteem/self worth.

98,1dip96l,WIBTA if I refuse to take care of my partner's child and ask him not to take her in? ,"Throwaway because a few colleagues know my account. 
English is not my first language. 

Me (43f) and my partner (40m) are been together 1,5years, living together in the last 6 months. But we know each other for 20 years, he just moved away 4 years ago, and moved back before we started dating.  
My rental got sold a year ago and the new owner increased the rent +decided he's not gonna allow my dogs. My boyfriend offered to move in to his house. It's closer to my job, it has a shady backyard for my pups, and we are really good living together. I know he even planning to propose (he talked with his cousin a few weeks ago and I overheard it)  
  
Now to the issue: three weeks ago his ex  fwb (35-ish f) contacted him, and long story short, he has a 1yo daughter.  And the baby mama is going to jail (for at least 2 years). BM.'s plan was that her mom, baby's grandma would take care of the kid, but she broke her hip. According to BM the CPS deemed that grandma can't be the guardian of the child, and if she can't find another family member, the kid goes to foster care.  
We went there that day, she agreed on a DNA test, and we got the results back yesterday.  He immediately called his lawyer to start the process of adding his name to the birth certificate. I stupidly said I'm there for him, and help as I can, but I meant emotionally. I mean he just had proof that he has a kid.  
 Last night his  cousin and wife came to our place, and they actually started planning who could help with what. Cousin's wife works at a private daycare, and offered a free place there.  They offered baby supplies, he's gonna come in the weekend to paint and make a nursery from the unused room, what was supposed to be my office...  
He can go for ""paternity leave"" and his job offered a ""part time"" contract for him. But that means every week in two days he would work 20hours (1day 9am-9pm, 1 day 1pm-9pm)  
In that two day's I would be the one who pick up the kid from daycare and be with her until 10-11pm (depends on traffic) 

I can't do that. I was thinking of hiring a nanny, but it would be weird to have a stranger in our home those late hours.

We have an in ground pool and we have a  2 year old, who we will call E. M and J arrive & the kids immediately want to go in pool. I put my E in her puddle jumper and spend the next 2 hours or so over by the pool watching all three of the kids. 

Food is ready, kids get out of pool to eat. When the kids are finished eating, we have a small trampoline & sandbox & other various toys next to the table  where all the kids are playing.

I'm sitting at the table with J & we were both having a  hard seltzer drink. It was my 2nd one and I believe her 3rd. I was not drunk or tipsy (my 1st drink was an hour and a half prior). 

Jack and M went into the garage where the beer is and J asks me to go check on M to make sure he isn't chugging beers ( his drinking is a point of contention in their marriage) She says she didn't want to check herself  bc he will tell her she is nagging him. She also says that she will watch E while i do this. I say OK.

101,1diovbd,AITA for biting off more than I can chew?,"Last week an elderly relative of mine had a serious accident and now needs in home help for the next 3 months. At a glance it didn’t sound like too much trouble, just helping them get up, get to places, clean, and handle meds for them annd their pet. I really care about and love this person, but I’m only on day three and I feel exhausted.
I’m only supposed to be here for a month, because their son and his wife leave for vacation in a week. He asked me immediately when it happened if I could go out to help. I was flustered and said yes as soon as possible. Turned out they didn’t expect for me to be available until the end of the month when they left for vacation, but were delighted I could be there sooner. it wasn’t exactly something I could walk back after that. Also important to note while his wife is a retired nurse, my relative absolutely hates her. The nurse is a massive bitch who takes pride in the fact that she ruined his first marriage by cheating with him throughout it. Anyway on to the main problem.
I can’t get anymore than 5-6 hours of interrupted sleep each night. I can’t nap at all during the day, because I’m trying to clean, run errands and make sure everyone is properly medicated on time. Even with timers I’ve nearly missed the pet’s medicine twice. I do take breaks when the relative is napping or resting, but I’ll play a level of a Mario game or something on the switch or browse my phone to stay awake because I know they’ll need to go to the bathroom or get something the minute my eyes close.
Night sucks. I feed them get them to bed on time and then clean up the house from dinner and the dog. The dog has a prolapse than smears on the tiles and needs to be cleaned daily. This takes about an hour or so which gets me to bed at 9-10:00. Even after taking them to the bathroom right before bed they’ll need to get up to pee around 12-1. Last night I had gone to sleep at 10 and they woke up needing to change position maybe ten minutes into sleep and then was back at 1 for bathroom. They originally told me they get up at 6, but that only happened the first night when to they needed to get up 4 times as we tried to get the medication on a schedule. Turns out they actually tend to wake up at 4 every morning, 3:30 today, eat breakfast and go back to bed. There is just no consistency with their sleep schedule and I have to be up by 5 or 6 so even though I try I just can’t get back to sleep. Each time I get up at night it takes me maybe 30 minutes to fall back to sleep.
I feel like such an asshole because I know they need help, I have the time, and my ticket out to help was paid for, but I can’t imagine keeping this up for a whole month. They also keep telling me how grateful they are that I was able to come out, which just makes me want to cry because I feel like I can’t keep this up.

104,1dinwna,AITA for introducing my stepcousin to a girly hobby?,"
I am a 14yo male. I live with my grandma and she really likes to knit. I learnt to knit from her when I was little and I really enjoy it. Just when I’m bored or have free time I’ll knit. My family doesn’t care and it has caused no problems so far.

My uncle got married and he has a stepson who is 7 years old. We’ve all been getting on quite well. I gave him a beanie for his birthday that I knitted and he was really interested in how I made it. So I told him what knitting was and he was really excited and wanted to try it too.

I told her that he wanted to learn to knit and she was a bit upset about it and said that he didn’t need to learn it and took away the knitting needles.

I am a 14yo male. I live with my grandma and she really likes to knit. I learnt to knit from her when I was little and I really enjoy it. Just when I’m bored or have free time I’ll knit. My family doesn’t care and it has caused no problems so far.

My uncle got married and he has a stepson who is 7 years old. We’ve all been getting on quite well. I gave him a beanie for his birthday that I knitted and he was really interested in how I made it. So I told him what knitting was and he was really excited and wanted to try it too.

105,1dint8f,AITA for walking slow on the left side of the sidewalk?,"So today I was walking to dialysis treatment as usual. I admit, I was looking at my phone. However, I am very specific to only walk on a specific side of the sidewalk, so others can pass by. All of a sudden some guy on a skateboard complains about me walking slow, and in that moment, I stopped to type on my phone, and then he lightly hits my cheek (accidentally via impact). I stopped walking near the intersection of two roads, but there was enough space on the sidewalk to go in front of me and to the left. Anyways, I apologized and something dropped out of his backpack so he had to chase it. I held his bottle that fell down while he chased something else. He grabbed it and he was clearly very upset at me but didn't say anything.  

Based on the fact that he was right behind me when he complained about me being slow, I'm pretty sure he was zipping around on the sidewalk. I don't mind yielding to scooters or bicycles or whatever, but such vehicles are very silent so you have to make your presence known if you want people to yield, and you have to know there's a possibility people will walk slow. I'm really good at getting out of a vehicle's way, but I have to know the vehicle is there.  

I strongly feel that he could have just gone around me easily, since there was enough space to do so. I only was walking slow because I knew there was enough space to go around. If there was a lot of traffic I'd obviously be walking very fast.  

Although I wasn't thinking much about it, I think I was on the left because that's where the bike rack for CitiBikes rental bikes is, so there would be more space on the right.

107,1dins2d,AITA for telling my mom I wouldn’t have given her any money even if I had any savings ,"My mom (F44) has been out of a job since March 2024 and has been relying on mine (F20) and my stepdads pay checks to keep the house running as all the bills go out of her account.  It’s been tough especially with the current cost of living crisis. 

I make around £1700 after tax and give her £1000-1200 every month whilst she’s unemployed. She’s really struggling even with this as it’s not a replacement to her salary (which is much more). Usually her and my stepdad split the bills and I save/spend my pay. 

She was also unemployed for 6months last year and I also helped her then.

 Lately she’s been really scolding and arguing with me almost every other day about how I have no savings and if I did I would’ve been able to help her more. I usually just keep quiet as I know she’s under stress from not having a job and it really has knocked her self confidence but I had enough after months of this. 

I told her that I give her about 2/3 of my salary and that even if I had any savings I wouldn’t have given them to her because that’s my money for my future.  She got really upset/angry at this comment and said I’m an ungrateful daughter who doesn’t even pay rent but can’t help her in her time of need. 

(I don’t pay rent because I wanted to move out and get my own place for a while with a friend but my mom didn’t want me to, so we came to an agreement that I’ll stay at home on her wish but I’m not paying rent)

Am I the asshole for not adopting my ex’s child?
this is a bit complex and my first time posting

I am a dad of 4 children 1 girl and triplets. During 2021 my ex and myself split during Covid but I remained in the house to help her support with the children. After one month of splitting she got a new partner and brought him into the house to live with us ( I slept on the seate). During my time there my ex and her partner were always arguing and splitting up her partner blamed me for all of the issues they had I also had death threats from her partner as well. Even though I stayed out of the whole situation I was focusing on the children and housework. 

After a few months of living like this I moved out on my own. Not long after I had a phone call from children services asking me to collect all of the children from her parents house as my children have been removed from the house due to abusive relationship with my ex and partner. I have had the children with me now for 3 years and have full custody after a long fight with everything. 
During the Period with children services my ex got pregnant with her partner. She ended up losing the child to social services due to neglect and not being consistent. I have had call from asking if I want to adopt my ex’s child as she nor her partner can have the child due to a lot of issues.

Both sides of my ex and her family can’t have the child either due to health and other issues.

I feel I can’t adopt him as my ex but me and my children through a lot of issues. Such as being abusive to me and not looking after the children properly. I have explained to children services if I take the child on I would not treat him fairly and have some sort of disgust even though none of it is the child’s thought. 

My ex keeps calling me for not adopting her child even though I have had no involvement in the child’s life. She is saying it’s my children sibling and he deserves to be with family. I have explained and said to her that I want no part in raising that child as it is a reminder of what she and her partner put me through.

109,1dinmex,AITAH? Cleaning up after my partner?,"
I feel like this really is completely trivial/stupid/ridiculous but I want an impartial opinion.

Also, sorry for the mundane backstory but to give some context:

I live with my partner, both 30, in a rental property.
Rental inspection this morning (Tuesday), which we’ve both known about for more than a week.
 I’d actually rearranged it due to me starting night shifts tonight and being asleep during the day the rest of the week.
My partner had been working all weekend and  Monday can be variable but usually long hours (unsure as I wasn’t home).
I’d spent some time off over the weekend staying with some friends/family, and returned late last (Monday) night.  I came home then so that I could have some of this morning to tidy up, knowing that my partner likely wouldn’t get time to do much of this, and that he’s quite messy and not great at cleaning.
Cue a little bit of a mad rush this morning from him trying to do some of what he could, and, admittedly there wasn’t anything that required significant attention after this, and finished what I could (I won’t bore anyone further with specifics).  So I finished and the house wasn’t pristine, but hey, we live here there’s some dust and crumbs, I thought it was good enough.  Not so.

Agent came and carried out the inspection, didn’t mention anything to me at the time, so assumed all was okay.

Cue my partner being emailed a picture of the 2nd bathroom and being told that the shower/tub and toilet need attention.  
It’s at this point I’ll mention that my partner is almost exclusively the one of us who uses that bathroom, and that recently he’d been a bit intoxicated and was camped in that bathroom and using that toilet to contain his stomach contents when they reappeared, and attempted to empty his bladder at some point.  Let’s just say that a lot of both of these did not make it into the toilet bowl.  Gross.  
(He was fine and I figured I’d let him be and he’d clean himself and the rest up later.)

So this morning I’d cast my eye into that bathroom and thought it was fine - obvs not well enough.

Now my partner is angry with me for not cleaning that bathroom and being emailed about it, and that we should’ve left the inspection date as originally planned for later this week (he’d agreed previously with the date change and said it was fine/didn’t bother him).

He got home late after work (he’s usually not in a great mood regardless of the time after work) and I pointed out to him that I’d cleaned the rest of the house and etc and that perhaps he should have cleaned up after himself in the bathroom at the time, and asked why should I have to clean up that sort of mess of his?  Now he’s not speaking to me and is sleeping in another room.

110,1din91n,AITA for not giving my former SIL the necklace I had made from my wedding rings from my deceased husband?,"When I (27F) was 22 I got married to my high school sweetheart who passed away five months after we married when a drunk driver drove into his car.

It took me a while to take off my rings, and when I did I didn’t want them to just sit in a draw forever. So, I took them to a jeweller and had his and my rings melted down and used the gold and the stones to make a pendent and some small stud earrings. I have the earrings in my jewellery box and I wear the necklace everyday. One, because I like the way it looks and two, because I like the idea of having a tangible part of him with me always.

Last month my boyfriend (34M) of almost two years proposed to me and I said yes.

I keep in touch with my former SIL (29F) who we will call Ava and last weekend she invited me out for drinks. We caught up a bit before she congratulated me on my engagement, she then asked me if she could have my necklace since it would mean more to her as his sister then it would to me now that I was getting remarried and moving on. Which honestly stunned me that anyone would outright ask for something like that. I told her I would think about it and moved the conversation along but went home shortly after as it was just awkward. I just want to make it clear that it is not an heirloom piece, or overly expensive. It was a small emerald ring that we found on holiday at a local jeweller and I fell in love with it.  

I told my best friend (F28) about it and she said that it seemed strange that I was still so attached to it given its history and my new engagement. She thinks that I should probably give it to Ava as it would mean more to her, and I should shed anything from my old life and embrace my new one. She said that I should get a new necklace and make new memories, and that she would go with me or I could ask my fiancé.

But the thing is yes, I have moved on, and I am completely happy in my relationship and I am so excited for the life we are creating together. But a part of my will always have love for my former husband and mourn him and the life that we could have had together, and I don’t think that that takes away anything from my new relationship. They are different loves and lives.

But now it feels silly to me that I have conveyed all this into a necklace.

My fiancé says he does not care and he knows that I love him and our life together, and understands that I will always have some level of grief and that he loves how I have loved and keep loving and how I embrace life and people because of my experience.

Sorry that my English is bad, it is my only language and I have no real excuse - but I work nightshift I think that it lowers my brain function sometimes.

So AITA for not wanting to give my former SIL my necklace?

  
**Edit:** 

Thank you to everyone who commented, reading through the comments made me cry and I do intend to respond to them I just feel a bit overwhelmed by all of the kindness. I am a longtime lurker of Reddit so this is all very new to me.

I want to thank those who corrected me, late husband is the term I was trying to think of but couldn’t when I wrote this, I find it really hard to word everything about my late husband like the term ‘moved on’ feels very casual and inaccurate but I am not sure what is an accurate way to say it. 

But I am keeping my necklace.

 

I just wanted to clear up that my best friend is really one of the most incredible people, she is my rock, and a big part of why I am still around and not locked away somewhere (hospital, prison it felt like it could have gone either way for a while there). She and my mum tag-teamed me after the accident and made sure I ate and would just sit with me in silence. She found a grief support group and would drive me there and wait for me in the carpark when meetings finished.

And what I could never repay her for was how she stood so strongly for me during the court hearings, I had never felt such pure, unadulterated hatred towards anyone or anything as I did to that driver and she held my hand through it all and helped me get through it. She let me sit in my grief and anger but didn’t let it consume me.

It felt like my brain snapped and she helped me stick it back together, but like that Japanese art style where they repair broken vases with gold so it is broken but when it is put back together it is stronger and more beautiful. I don’t know where I would be without her because she didn’t have to do any of what and she did.

I don’t like the way she worded what she said, but she has always been the type that after a breakup she tosses away any reminders of her ex, I’ve gone with her to buy new clothing to replace ones that hold to vivid of memories. I think what some of the comments say is right and that she compares the grief she has experienced from breakups to what I have experienced. Which while you can’t compare grief because grief is grief, the experiences are worlds apart.  

 

Ava really isn’t a bad person, she was my sister for years, I used to absolutely adore her (after I turned 19 though, before 19 she thought me and her brother were brats). But after the court hearings my former MIL, FIL and to an extent Ava cut contact with me because seeing me brought back to many memories, which I understand but it hurt me deeply because they were a big part of my family since I was 15.

Ava and I still kept in contact but it was more of a holidays and birthdays kind of thing with the occasional drinks and dinner. So, while I still have a lot of love for her our relationship has changed drastically, and her asking me what she did and how she worded it was really not in the realm of anything I thought she would say or ask of me. She does have some of my late husband’s belongings like things from his childhood and knickknacks and some clothing so I don’t understand why she would think to ask for my necklace.

I am going to take advice from the comments and talk to her and try to figure out where she is coming from, reading the different perspectives has really helped me think more clearly and feel a little less hurt by what she said. Because of our history I want to give her the benefit of the doubt at first, but if she pushes the topic then I will have to make some choices. I am not sure how I am going to word it yet or if I want to say it via text or in person. But I will figure that out.



Grief is really strange and hard and isn’t something you understand until it happens to you.

What kind of helped me to understand, and made me feel like I wasn’t losing my mind, was the visualisation that your soul is like a bubble that grows with you and your experiences and relationships and you are just floating around in it. Good experiences and relationships add things to the bubble that make it beautiful like little bits of glitter and flowers and fluffiness. Bad things add spikes and staples and grief is like one big spike that when it first strikes goes from one end to the other and encompasses everything and you bump up against it all the time at first and it just really hurts. Then time passes and your bubble grows around the spike, the spike is still there but you don’t touch it as often, but when you do it hurts just as bad as the first time. But the upside to that is the good things like joy like when you think of someone you love and it’s all fluffy and safe and nice. I don’t know if that makes sense to anyone else but it has always helped me to remember that fresh, fiery pain won’t feel like that forever and that I will bump up against something fluffy and kind and happy.

When I (27F) was 22 I got married to my high school sweetheart who passed away five months after we married when a drunk driver drove into his car.

It took me a while to take off my rings, and when I did I didn’t want them to just sit in a draw forever. So, I took them to a jeweller and had his and my rings melted down and used the gold and the stones to make a pendent and some small stud earrings. I have the earrings in my jewellery box and I wear the necklace everyday. One, because I like the way it looks and two, because I like the idea of having a tangible part of him with me always.

Last month my boyfriend (34M) of almost two years proposed to me and I said yes.

I keep in touch with my former SIL (29F) who we will call Ava and last weekend she invited me out for drinks. We caught up a bit before she congratulated me on my engagement, she then asked me if she could have my necklace since it would mean more to her as his sister then it would to me now that I was getting remarried and moving on. Which honestly stunned me that anyone would outright ask for something like that. I told her I would think about it and moved the conversation along but went home shortly after as it was just awkward. I just want to make it clear that it is not an heirloom piece, or overly expensive. It was a small emerald ring that we found on holiday at a local jeweller and I fell in love with it.  

I told my best friend (F28) about it and she said that it seemed strange that I was still so attached to it given its history and my new engagement. She thinks that I should probably give it to Ava as it would mean more to her, and I should shed anything from my old life and embrace my new one. She said that I should get a new necklace and make new memories, and that she would go with me or I could ask my fiancé.

But the thing is yes, I have moved on, and I am completely happy in my relationship and I am so excited for the life we are creating together. But a part of my will always have love for my former husband and mourn him and the life that we could have had together, and I don’t think that that takes away anything from my new relationship. They are different loves and lives.

But now it feels silly to me that I have conveyed all this into a necklace.

My fiancé says he does not care and he knows that I love him and our life together, and understands that I will always have some level of grief and that he loves how I have loved and keep loving and how I embrace life and people because of my experience.

Sorry that my English is bad, it is my only language and I have no real excuse - but I work nightshift I think that it lowers my brain function sometimes.

So AITA for not wanting to give my former SIL my necklace?

  
**Edit:** 

Thank you to everyone who commented, reading through the comments made me cry and I do intend to respond to them I just feel a bit overwhelmed by all of the kindness. I am a longtime lurker of Reddit so this is all very new to me.

I want to thank those who corrected me, late husband is the term I was trying to think of but couldn’t when I wrote this, I find it really hard to word everything about my late husband like the term ‘moved on’ feels very casual and inaccurate but I am not sure what is an accurate way to say it. 

But I am keeping my necklace.

 

I just wanted to clear up that my best friend is really one of the most incredible people, she is my rock, and a big part of why I am still around and not locked away somewhere (hospital, prison it felt like it could have gone either way for a while there). She and my mum tag-teamed me after the accident and made sure I ate and would just sit with me in silence. She found a grief support group and would drive me there and wait for me in the carpark when meetings finished.

And what I could never repay her for was how she stood so strongly for me during the court hearings, I had never felt such pure, unadulterated hatred towards anyone or anything as I did to that driver and she held my hand through it all and helped me get through it. She let me sit in my grief and anger but didn’t let it consume me.

It felt like my brain snapped and she helped me stick it back together, but like that Japanese art style where they repair broken vases with gold so it is broken but when it is put back together it is stronger and more beautiful. I don’t know where I would be without her because she didn’t have to do any of what and she did.

I don’t like the way she worded what she said, but she has always been the type that after a breakup she tosses away any reminders of her ex, I’ve gone with her to buy new clothing to replace ones that hold to vivid of memories. I think what some of the comments say is right and that she compares the grief she has experienced from breakups to what I have experienced. Which while you can’t compare grief because grief is grief, the experiences are worlds apart.  

 

Ava really isn’t a bad person, she was my sister for years, I used to absolutely adore her (after I turned 19 though, before 19 she thought me and her brother were brats). But after the court hearings my former MIL, FIL and to an extent Ava cut contact with me because seeing me brought back to many memories, which I understand but it hurt me deeply because they were a big part of my family since I was 15.

Ava and I still kept in contact but it was more of a holidays and birthdays kind of thing with the occasional drinks and dinner. So, while I still have a lot of love for her our relationship has changed drastically, and her asking me what she did and how she worded it was really not in the realm of anything I thought she would say or ask of me. She does have some of my late husband’s belongings like things from his childhood and knickknacks and some clothing so I don’t understand why she would think to ask for my necklace.

I am going to take advice from the comments and talk to her and try to figure out where she is coming from, reading the different perspectives has really helped me think more clearly and feel a little less hurt by what she said. Because of our history I want to give her the benefit of the doubt at first, but if she pushes the topic then I will have to make some choices. I am not sure how I am going to word it yet or if I want to say it via text or in person. But I will figure that out.



Grief is really strange and hard and isn’t something you understand until it happens to you.

What kind of helped me to understand, and made me feel like I wasn’t losing my mind, was the visualisation that your soul is like a bubble that grows with you and your experiences and relationships and you are just floating around in it. Good experiences and relationships add things to the bubble that make it beautiful like little bits of glitter and flowers and fluffiness. Bad things add spikes and staples and grief is like one big spike that when it first strikes goes from one end to the other and encompasses everything and you bump up against it all the time at first and it just really hurts. Then time passes and your bubble grows around the spike, the spike is still there but you don’t touch it as often, but when you do it hurts just as bad as the first time. But the upside to that is the good things like joy like when you think of someone you love and it’s all fluffy and safe and nice. I don’t know if that makes sense to anyone else but it has always helped me to remember that fresh, fiery pain won’t feel like that forever and that I will bump up against something fluffy and kind and happy.

You can even fall in love again, which I am so lucky and grateful for my fiancé. He is truly a gem (to soon?) of a man and makes me feel so safe and warm. Which is a feeling that I didn’t feel for a long, long while.

So she let me move out only after I got married the first time with my now ex (he is my daughter's father).

She also had friends there, so she moved there. Somehow, she ended up in an area far from any of them. Now she feels lonely and too tired to take care of my father on her own.

My daughter wishes we lived near grandma again. My wife supports me in my decision to stay here. I wouldn't be able to support my mom even living closer—I often cannot handle the load I already have.

If Alice specifically asks ""Hey can Amy come over for a sleepover?"" I'll reach out to Amy's parents and try to set it up.

My mother said how they are much older and deserved to have a place they loved, and we still have plenty of time we are young etc and since they were going to guarantor for us not much we could do anyway, so we loaned them our savings to try to stop them from paying LMI, my dad has a good paying FIFO job but they like to enjoy their life and spend their money, they could easily get a loan to cover the mortgage, but we figured we could try help them with deposit so they hopefully didn't have to pay LMI. I had stopped working when I was pregnant (I was casual FIFO) and my husband worked at the supermarket, but we were awesome savers, and they charged us around $30-$50/week for my bedroom. The deal was we have cheap rent to take over the house ($200/week for the 4×2, market rate would  have been around $350 back then if the house was tenant ready which it wasn't, backyard was only partially done, the place wasnt well maintained, cracks where the walls meet the the ceiling from the house settling from when they built the house about 10 years prior, half the house is unpainted, most of what was wallpapered or painted I did or at least partly did, they left a bunch of stuff there to store including a car in the garage) in compensation for them to keep the deposit for the time being, and my brother keeps his room available, as he was FIFO and also spent 3-6 months a year overseas in a cheaper country with his family who live there. He paid $30/week when he was staying at the house, not at work or overseas.  COVID hit and prices went up, our rent didn't as was the deal. My eldest brother was struggling to find a new place to rent and asked to rent this house. So my parents offered for him and his family to rent it for $350, and asked us to move in to their new house, we would have 2 small bedrooms and pay $200/week. We agreed to help out my brother, my husband transferred to the supermarket 30 minutes drive from them (I drove him as he doesn't drive which bit into the pay and we debated if the job was even worth it anymore), and started working casual at the mine site near them. A year later my brother decided to move out so they asked us to move back up as they would rather rent to family vs strangers and for us to continue paying $350/week, and keep middle brothers bedroom available. We said okay again, husband decided to quit supermarket job as transferring again would be a hassle. He gets picked up by company to do the drive down to mine site and gets accom down there. Now my brother has moved him and his family for a year from overseas, we set up our spare room, which was for storage, for their 11 year old daughter. We agreed they would pay $150/week plus bills for the 2 rooms (again, it's a 4×2 house). They moved and we decided to charge them $120/week. It should be pointed out that they own 2 apartments overseas where they live, the second one they borrowed $30k to get. He gets money for online studies, she occasionally sells artwork online to get some extra cash, and they have rented out 1 of the apartments for a small amount of extra income (they have a family member looking after their cats so haven't charged rent for 1 of the apartments) now the issue is, now that they're here my mother is saying they should spend half their time down with them and we shouldn't charge them anything when they aren't here. The conversation started with her insulting me and swearing via messages about how I was trying to profit off them charging them half the rent etc and how wrong it was, then she corrected saying not $175/week but $150 to which I corrected it was actually $120. She kept going not happy, I explained we thought $60/room for the minor rooms (each around 3×3.5m) was fair and we decided $170/week for our master (5×5m)+ensuite, being almost triple the cost was fair. She later came back saying yes that was a fair price but she thinks they should spend more time down there so I can charge $120/week but I shouldn't when they aren't there. Honestly I was already really annoyed by her acting this way and complaining when he hadn't said anything, and she was saying I should give them a discount as they were going to be fixing up the garden etc (which I responded benefitted her not me as I don't care but raises the value of their house as they haven't done much with it) so I basically responded I wasn't interested in discussing it with her if he wants to he can discuss it with me. She also mentioned raising our rent if we were going to act like this, so I said I could always raise his to cover the difference. She said it's wrong of me to be like this we are family etc, that I am trying to benefit off him but I don't see how it's okay for us to foot the bill, we aren't charging anything for internet which is $100/month and he needs for his studies, so we have kept the higher internet even though we were going to downgrade to save money. He also has access and helps himself to all our food. We agreed he would pay the difference in bills as we are really careful with our usage and he never has been. As is we may never be able to afford our own home, but we have been desperately saving for the past 6 years, sacrificing most things to be able to save all we have, and I don't see how I am in the wrong for asking him to put towards rent and bills. If we go away we still have to give my parents rent, so why should he not pay his portion if he goes away anyway? Also currently they both owe roughly $30k each to us, which is half our savings, the $30k my parents have they've had for 4 years now, and we deduct rent and bills from that as they want it to stay on their mortgage to keep the cost lower. It should also be mentioned that I have to spend around $50k on surgeries so feeling the sting of that financially as that's years of savings gone. AITAH in this situation? Adding: apparently it is relevant to add that my mother helps us clean when she visits, and that since moving in my brother and his wife have washed windows and helped clean as well, majority has been in his room to make space for them but also around the house, also one of our kids is a hurricane and makes a lot of mess,the house is typically messy, we can clean and five minutes later it's messy again, this was known before they moved. My mother also has much higher standards and would rather the house looks like a show home, part of why she cleans when she comes (we clean too obviously, and mostly have it clean when they come for the weekly visit, but anything left gets done by time she leaves, we do tell her not to but she hates seeing any mess, and wants to help out).

Since I’ve gone to college, I’ve leaned out even more, and my parents have been trying to entice me to eat more by sending me $100-200 every other week to go out to eat or DoorDash something. Their intention is that they think if I have the opportunity to get tasty food, I’ll eat more than I do, but it doesn’t work like that, because when I’m not hungry, I’m not hungry, regardless if I’m able to DoorDash good food or not.

I tried telling them this so they don’t waste their money, but they insisted on me keeping the money. My second semester of college, I’ve spent most of the money they send me on clothes since I’m into fashion and wouldn’t spend the money on food anyways. 

My parents found this out and think I’m in the wrong for using money they sent for food for clothes instead. I don’t think so, because I tried returning the money to them, and they refused, so what am I supposed to do, let it go to waste?

119,1dim7a2,AITA for calling my sister a sexist drama queen for the comments she made about me?,"I was using my sisters laptop for something and ended up on Reddit while looking something up. I realized she had a profile and look at some of her comments. I was just curious, no nefarious reasons. I wasn't expecting to find anything.

But I saw one comment she left about me, talking about my dating life. It was in a thread of a celebrity bouncing from relationship to relationship.

She said, ""I know women who are perpetually in relationships and never take a gap between each man. My sister is one. She was like that as a teen and still is now. I realized how important being in a relationship is to these people and how these women seem to center men in their lives above everything. I could never just bounce from guy to guy like that.""

I'm sorry, but that pissed me off in ways I can't even say. It is true I move on from relationships fast, but why the fuck shouldn't I? I want to continue looking and find someone new. It is so much easier to deal with the breakup and hurt of your past relationship while in a new relationship. It's just how I like to be, and how dare she judge me for that and act like I'm worse than her?

I sent her a screenshot and said she was being a judgmental asshole and that she perpetually single so she doesn't understand the benefits of being in a relationship.

I said I don't judge her for being single for almost a decade, why is she judging me? I also added that she was being sexist with what she said. It came off almost slut shaming me. Like would she have the same problem if I were a guy? Probably not.

Either way, I am really annoyed with her. She is judging me for things she should not be judging me for and talking about my relationships on dumb Reddit threads.

120,1dim2ac,AITA for telling my girlfriend I didn’t want her to come on a night out with my “theatre friends”,"I (18M) am a huge music nerd and have always enjoyed musical theatre. Last year I auditioned for a part in “Beauty and the Beast” and fortunately got the part of Gaston. Although I felt extremely lucky it is no secret that I have practiced singing and music for many years because I wanted to perform on stage. My girlfriend at the time was very keen on the idea of joining me in the play so I encouraged her to audition as well, however, mostly due to nerves, her audition went poorly and she was not given a lead role. 

My college has a policy that all those who audition are granted a part in the Chorus as either back up dances or smaller roles, however my girlfriend felt this humiliating both because as I had a larger part and because she would be older than most other Chorus members, causing her. to drop out and not be part of the show. 

After rehearsing throughout the year I became good friends with many of the cast members as we shared many similar interests and were all passionate about music. One of the other lead roles organised that we would all go out for a meal on the night of the last show to celebrate, a college tradition, which I was incredibly excited for and we all agreed to. 

On the last night my girlfriend came to see us perform. It was the biggest night of them all and went incredibly well, causing her to be exceptionally excited afterwards as her and my family and friends saw me after the show. She then said that we should celebrate and I told her her that the two of us could meet up after the dinner and stay at mine to watch a movie or something, to which she said she would prefer to come out to dinner with me and all the other cast members. 

I then told her that I didn’t want to her to come to the dinner as she wasn’t part of the production so the others would be confused as well as this dinner being somewhat of a tradition which I felt was important. 

In truth I also felt that I was more deserving to attend as I had practiced for the show and grown close to many of the cast members, which she did not know well. 

In response she got quite upset and called me inconsiderate. Does that make me the asshole?

121,1dils36,AITA - Inner child at work,"I am quite immature for my age (38m). For one, I don't have my own place, I still live in a rented apartment. I have minimal savings/investments, spending most of my salary on living expenses. My family lives quite happily, but I sometimes worry what would happen once I am retired - you get the gist. I am also quite childish at times. I love gaming, I sometimes play with my son and I don't let him win as most parents usually do.

Now, my extended family knows that I am immature and quite childish. 3 months ago, there was a family gathering on account of my grandmother's passing. My grandmother was a fun lady and wanted us to have a happy fun gathering with kids in the extended family instead of a sad funeral. I had office that day, while most of my cousins and their spouses had an off day (it was a local holiday, but I work for an MNC where it was an optional holiday that one needs to apply for). So I got there a bit late (7 PM, everyone else arrived by 6).

I reach and immediately am seated at the Kids' (youngest at 3y, oldest at 14y) table. All the other tables are full, some tables had some teens sitting with adults, and apparently, since I have an ""inner child"", I was seated with the kids. The underlying hope was for me to play ""Uncle Baby-sitter"". My wife was not happy, but told me to go ahead with the flow and let my inner child out. My son did not attend the gathering, which was a plus for what happened next, and the reason for this post. While I believe I was not the AH, I simply acted how everyone expected me to act (immature and childish), I leave that judgement to you all.

The next 2 hours I spent with the kids giving them tips on ""parent management"". How to get away with stuff, how to not get caught doing stuff, how to emotionally blackmail, when to cry and when to throw a public tantrum, how to delete browser history, how to spoof GPS tracking, how to hide apps and data in phone - all sorts of lessons that would help kids become the bane of their parents' existence. And I told everyone to openly say where they learned all this new stuff.

The fallout was epic. Within 20 days, a meeting was called where all adults were to meet. I skipped that (obviously because I'm not an adult). My wife also skipped as she is not close to my family. I learned later from my mom that everyone was super pissed with me for ""ruining"" their children.

I became the coolest uncle in my extended family though. Suddenly I was really popular with kids that didn't even know about me earlier. The knowledge I had donated really spread.

We have another adult only meeting coming up. This time, I have received multiple calls from different people asking me to attend it compulsorily.

So, AITA? I feel this post can also go to MC.

Update-1: Thanks for the support guys. Wanted to answer a few YTA comments:

1. Over the years, I have given several tips to the parents on how to handle tantrums, how to catch children with browser history, how to catch lies. They took the advices. However, due to my childish (their word, not mine) nature, I never received appropriate respect (I am the eldest of all my cousins). This was a sort of balancing act that I believe was long due.
2. The kind of technical knowhow required to successfully GPS spoof would be really beneficial to children, if they had an affinity towards that knowledge. Same with browser history. Deleting from just the browser is nothing, it can be recovered, which in case of any serious event, the cops easily can.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA - Inner child at work I am quite immature for my age (38m).

2. The kind of technical knowhow required to successfully GPS spoof would be really beneficial to children, if they had an affinity towards that knowledge. Same with browser history. Deleting from just the browser is nothing, it can be recovered, which in case of any serious event, the cops easily can.",0.0,1.0658906698226929,1,0
122,1diljsw,AITA for not texting first?,"So I have a friend, let's call her Ally. Me and Ally have been friends for a while, we bonded because we play the same sport which is an all males sport. We had a very close friend that started back in highschool and back then there was a situation where I got caught with za, and my mom blamed her and we weren't allowed to see each other. This broke us a little, but we rekindled and I thought our friendship was stronger than ever. We hung out, chatted on the phone occasionally, and we always updated each other on life no matter what. Recently she has a new boyfriend, I'd say of three months, who I've only met twice. They seem happy together, but now me and Ally never speak. It started slowly, but she quit replying to me and she won't make plans anymore. If I try to text, usually it goes unopened until I spam her phone. She also hangs out with either her boyfriend, one of our mutuals, or these two other friends. But if I were to try to make plans it gets shot down because she's busy or she already made plans. I even went off on her about this, she blamed her mental health or the fact that I never text first. I was shook at the last comment because all I've been doing is texting first.

125,1dil8ws,WIBTA if my coworkers and I worked to demote/fire our supervisor ,"My work hosts events like weddings, company parties, things of that sort. We serve food, bus tables, refill drinks, help with technical issues, all that jazz. Everyone except our supervisor.

Her job requires her to ""1. Relay information between the client and staff. 2. Relay information between management and the staff. 3. Carry out all duties required of (company name) banquet staff"". However as of late, she's done none of these things.

Examples include:
Taking a 2 hr nap on the job while me and another coworker worked a 13 hr shift 

Taking Molly on the clock 

Diappearing for 10-70 minutes a shift to smoke weed on the clock 

Standing and watching as understaffed crews carry out tasks

Telling the crew to do tasks that the client has already asked us to do (because she was out smoking) 

Complaining that the staff comes in late from breaks and lunches, while omitting she comes in late from breaks and lunches.

I will admit I am not perfect, I've taken a few more minutes than needed on a break. I've sat longer on the toilet to avoid going back to work, I've come in late and I have not met the exact expectations of my job several times. The issues is that I do these things once or twice every few shifts, she does at least 3 of the mentioned things every shift.

My main reason for disliking her is that she has bad mouthed all but 2 employees (who coincidentally, she hangs out with and referred to this job). Some and I get mentioned a few times, and some have been written up because she's complained multiple times a shift. Our management is under the impression that we are all lazy kids who don't do anything despite the fact that she has never done more than roll silver and stand on the floor in her 7 months here. The manager mentioned that she's bringing on more people, but because of how sparse events are, we only get 16-24 hrs a week at best. The people she wants to bring on are friends/former coworkers of hers and since our manager is swamped with so much work, she rarely has time to see us on the floor. Many of my coworkers are scared of being let go for being too critical of her/not meeting her near perfect expectations. I and the coworkers I am close with are fine since we know how to do things that she doesn't and have a very strong bond with our manager and guests. But some people who rely on this job are scared they will need to look for a new job.

We have some proof that she's violated company policies, some minor state laws, and is overall very very unreliable. But we don't want to because at the end of the day she's a single mom in community college trying to make ends meet.

 For the first couple of months, I did my part in keeping the home clean and just stuck to myself. I eventually landed a job working with him, and started contributing to paying my part of the bills. I currently pay my portion of rent & utilities, as well as purchase my own groceries and occasionally other household goods such as toilet paper or shower products for the rest of the home.

The home is a shared 2 bedroom 1 bathroom with him, his girlfriend, their 1.5 year old son, and his girlfriend’s sister. I sleep in the living room on my own bed. This detail is important for later. 


My friend and I work 5 days a week, and on the weekends I usually either relax and take some time to myself to play video games or I visit my girlfriend.  My friend likes to bring friends over and drink on the weekends, which I have no issue with as we share a lot of friends and but I rarely partake as I’m not the biggest fan of alcohol.

I try to keep my area in the living room clean, but as I am rarely home throughout the week due to work, or occasionally not home during the weekend, the extent of my messiness is clothing on my bed or occasionally trash by my bedside. I have limited space for my clothing which consists of a tiny closet in the living room where most of my belongings from my old house are. The trash by my bedside is usually only there for a couple hours with a maximum of a day before I throw it away. I have no issue with cleaning up behind myself, but I am a disorganized person. 

My friend believes I should start cleaning up the entirety of the living room, where his 1.5 year old son usually eats and leaves food strewn about, and where his friends usually leave messes on the weekends. I told him I’m not responsible for cleaning up after his child, nor his friends. My friend believes that I’m not helping out enough in the household by refusing to clean up behind them. I’ve also had multiple experiences with people in the household not respecting my space, such as placing drinks, empty food containers, trash, and even used diapers on my desk. I’ve also witnessed multiple instances of his girlfriend’s friends changing their children’s diapers on the bed I sleep in. I brought this up to him and he simply replied “What other people do isn’t my fault.” I simply want him to realize I don’t think it’s fair to hold me accountable for other people’s messes while completely disrespecting my space. I’ve considered moving in with my girlfriend but I wanted another opinion. AITA?

133,1dik3sh,AITA for being in a gc about a Catfish in our friend group ,"Throwaway because bf has my main account

I (24f) am in a large friend group that plays video games together. We range in age from 21-25 and are mostly men. I wanted more female friends in my group so I suggested we try to make some. Most of us know eachother in real life except for 3 in the main friend group.

We met this girl V (21f) in a game lobby and we all instantly LOVED her. She shared a lot of information about herself and she really mushed well with the friend group.

While everything seemed fine at first, I started picking up on things that seemed so fake or not true.

she claims to speak 7 languages and she claims to be a LAWYER, not a paralegal, a criminal lawyer at 21. The way she was talking made it seem untrue.

Well one of my friends, we will call him Andrew (23m) who met her - had a HUGE crush on her and ""found her on instagram"". We quickly realized it was not her but it was the REAL girl that I personally think she was stealing personality traits of...

Here's some examples:

1. Has the same name
2. Drives the same bike
3. Both in Law or Law School
4. has the same twitch/youtube banner
5. Lives in the same city
6. Speaks like her

These could all be coincidences but it made us uneasy as the two of us felt like we no longer knew who we were even talking to. The only things we know for sure is what she looks like (nothing like the real one) and her race (most likely).

Well Andrew decided to then go and tell two other people in the friend group that this girl stole so much of her personality from this ""celebrity"". They made a separate chat where he shared proof (screenshots, links).

When I spoke to my friends later in the day, Andrew told me that he had ""updated"" the other two on the situation and I got added to the group along with a few other people.

My boyfriend found out that I am in this chat and is calling me a bully. He says I should be sticking up for this girl and shutting down the gossip.

I didn't know I was being a bully and that would never be my intention. I didn't think my friends were doing anything wrong by sharing that this girl might not be who she says she is.

She assigned me this responsibility when she was living on the other end of the country and decided she wanted to move back to the area where I grew up and still live. Allegedly this was only an interim gig to make it so I could sign paperwork in her stead to buy a house for her to move into as she refused to entertain the idea of assisted living. 

She's emotionally and psychologically manipulative. She says hurtful things in pleasant tones and then insists you're 'taking it the wrong way'. She is so unpleasant to be around that no one else in our family will have anything to do with her; me and my sister are pretty much the last ones she hasn't completely alienated and pushed away. 

I had a pretty traumatic upbringing. I have PTSD and some other shit going on, as well as some physical disabilities. I'm disabled enough that the US government pays me poverty wages and supplies my health insurance, but my grandmother doesn't believe I'm really 'that sick'. 

This month I received a cancer diagnosis, after about a year of agonizing mysterious abdominal pain. My grandmother's response when I told her was that I can't be *sad* about it, and anyway, it's only stage one, that's barely a problem at all, her life is much worse than mine. I should try having some of her problems. 

I don't know what it is exactly, but it's like something finally clicked. Just because she's related to me doesn't mean... Anything, really. I'm an adult. I can choose who I spend my time with, and I want to choose people who appreciate having me around and make me happy. I don't thing she does with of those things. 

But I also know nobody's coming to step up when I go. We finally talked her into moving into a home, but she picked an independent living facility, not an assisted living place, so like... There's not even really desk help all the time. 

So idk. 

This last time we got into a fight, I finally blocked her number on my phone, so all she can do is leave rambling, irate voicemails, which she does at least once a day.

139,1diji3m,AITA for speaking nastily to my ex?,"Hey everyone,
This has a long background but I’m going to try and make it shorter!

BACKGROUND; me (26F) and my ex bf (25M) dated for a year. It started out as a really amazing relationship. He was perfect. Wrote me love letters, I got surprise flowers and gifts, I genuinely thought I was going to ymarry this person. Then, things turned sour. He started to see me less and less. He wouldn’t commit to plans with me, as he needed to always check what his friends were doing. Bear in mind, we lived an hour from eachother so only saw eachother maybe once per week. Then, he felt it was too much to text me, so only wanted to hear from me once over a phone call. He would ditch me for his friends, and was increasingly argumentative when I tried to make him see how this wasn’t normal. Eventually we broke up. When that happened, he was devestated. He stayed in touch with me and kept promising that he just needed some space and we would be back together as I’m the only one for him. We agreed to meet a week after the breakup, as he said he knew what he wanted now and it was me. That same night, he went out and kissed someone else. He called me, upset and I ignored him until the next day. He proceeded to go to her place and sleep with her that night. As the weeks went on, he kept talking to me and made me feel very sorry for him. So I forgave him and we started to meet again. He kept saying we’d be together in the future. Eventually, he broke it off randomly one day, saying he doesn’t have feelings for me anymore and doesn’t want me now or in the future. It broke my heart into pieces.

Over the next few months, he reached out three times to meet up and catch up. Everytime I agreed, he then said he couldn’t anymore as he’s busy. Drunk texts too, trying to come over late at night. 

So here is what happened. I met him this weekend at a bar. I was drunk, I had been out all day for my birthday. I ended up shouting at him. Real insults, nasty words. I was crying and shouting. Trying to get him to understand how he hurt me. The next day, he contacted me to say how awful I behaved and how out of line I was (I agree). I agree that I shouldn’t have shouted at him at all, it’s not me, it’s not my character. But I stand by the fact I have a right to feel anger. Did I mean everything I said? No I didn’t, but anyway I apologised over and over. He said it’s okay, I did the right thing by saying sorry and to forget it now. The problem is I can’t. I feel horrible. I know I deserve to feel this way. But I can’t eat or sleep over the last three days. I asked him if we could please meet so I could see if he’s okay and explain how sorry I am, he hasn’t responded. I know I deserve this. I just don’t know how to move forward. Any advice please? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for speaking nastily to my ex? Hey everyone,

I know I deserve to feel this way. But I can’t eat or sleep over the last three days. I asked him if we could please meet so I could see if he’s okay and explain how sorry I am, he hasn’t responded.

140,1dijhj2,AITA for co fronting my Co-Worker? ,"
I (27F) started working for a new company about a year ago. During this time, I've gotten to know my co-workers and I feel as if we have a fairly jovial workplace environment. Although I've made some friends, it isn't without it's downfalls. Workplace gossip is common, and it's worth mentioning about 85 percent of the employees are male. 

About 2 weeks ago, I noticed a shift in the atmosphere. People who were once friendly with me began acting strange. Co-workers started avoiding eye contact, hallway conversations ceased, and when I entered the break room people became quiet. 

John, a co-worker I'd gotten along with in the past, pulled me aside one day with a serious look on his face. He asked me if I'd been sending another employee (Martin, 36M) anonymous texts.

Apparently,  Martin has been receiving a multitude of texts from an unknown number. The contents of these messages include questions such as, ""were you hitting on me today?"" Or ""stop talking to your female co-workers."" 

The messages haven't stopped at Martin. His wife has gotten several messages from the same number with omnious warnings like, ""Just so you know, your husband is inappropriate with women at work.""

Martin's been telling everyone I am the culprit behind the messages because they started the day we met. We've interacted a handful of times, always over business and the conversation never strayed from professional. 

Yesterday, I finally had an opportunity to chat with Martin. When I attempted to meet with him I discovered his office door was closed, and was told he' be in ""meetings all day."" Because of this, I decided to give him a ring on the office phones at lunch. 

I asked Martin if he'd be willing to meet with me to talk about something. Immediately,  his tone was confrontational and rude. He said, ""what do you want"" then advised his schedule was ""very busy"" and he wasn't sure if he had time. I explained he needed to talk to me since my name was being thrown around in the gossip mill, and I wanted to talk it out like adults. Martin agreed to meet, except he never did. He went home early, and won't be back at the office again. 

Since this interaction, other co workers have began avoiding me as well including John. I'm not sure why Martin didn't want to speak with me. Did I go about this the wrong way, confusing work and personal issues? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-18,"AITA for co fronting my Co-Worker?

143,1dij9ay,AITA for not telling my father to put a shirt on in his own home?,"Hi Reddit, I (37F) find myself in a strange sort of conflict with my SIL (44F) and brother (47M). My parents and I are from the Midwest and currently we are experiencing a heat wave which is made significantly worse by the increased humidity. I do not live with my parents, but frequent the house as my father is in his 70s and they have a lot of critters to care for - horses, chickens, etc..

During the summer, my father will come in from working on fence or tending to some project and take his shirt off. This is a nightly occurance and has never been an issue before. My brother and his wife have recently come into town with my niece to spend the week. They live out of state and are not able to visit often due to schedules and work.

They arrived two days ago and this evening my brother approached me and asked me to speak to our father about keeping his shirt on in the evenings. He explained that he did not have an issue with dad, but SIL is uncomfortable with dad having his shirt off in the evenings. He explained that her family just ""doesn't do that"" and it is weirding her out. This is the first time they have stayed with my parents - they normally stay in a hotel and commute. 

Our father has recently had some serious health scares which brother has not been present for and as a result I am hyper vigilant regarding dad's stress levels and comfort. Our father also suffers from anxiety and a near compulsion to not upset anyone and I know that if I tell him SIL is uncomfortable around him because of this behavior that is normal for us - it would crush him to his core.

My boyfriend texted me 25 minutes before he was off of work, saying he was giving his coworker a ride home, and was going to swing by my house to grab his overnight bag on the way home. I asked him if I should expect him to bring his coworker in with him, and that I wasn’t prepared to meet him with my unwashed hair, and didn’t want to bother putting makeup on, so I could feel presentable. My boyfriend responded by saying “not if you don’t want him to, I was just going to swing by.” To which I said,  “ok, that’s what I was planning too.” Boyfriend gets there, grabs his things, asks me again if I’ll meet his coworker, to which I reiterate why I’m not prepared to do so, and even tell him to tell his coworker my reasoning. He asks me, have you seen him?, but laughs it off, and goes home.

 2 hours later, my boyfriend texts me saying how it made him really uncomfortable that he had to make his coworker stay in the car, that me “not letting him come in for 2 minutes” was rude, and that he “had to compliment me the whole rest of the ride to not make it weird.” I again, explain my reasoning for not meeting a (very casual) coworker, and that I shouldn’t be made to feel bad for having been honest about it. I explain how calling me rude and weird is aggressive and unnecessary, and apologize for making him feel uncomfortable. A whole slew of texts follow with him saying I’m being belligerently defensive , undermining him, downplaying his emotions and can’t take any criticism. He then asks if I’m drunk and says I’m acting insane, it’s shocking, and says show this thread to anyone and they would agree with me. AITA?

For example, he gives me hell any time I say ""I need"" something that I don't literally need. If I say ""I need to go to the store today,"" he'll say ""do you NEED to go to the store or do you WANT to go to the store."" I usually just shrug him off and say you know what I meant but there's one instance of this that's been causing actual fights.

In previous relationships I've liked to call my partner ""my love"" but any time I did that with him he kind of sneered and said stuff along the lines of ""what, am I your slave now?"" and so I don't say that anymore.

But he also applies that to other things. He doesn't have a problem when I call my dog ""my girl"" because she does literally belong to me.

I think it's pretty obvious that I just meant it as a term of endearment but he disagrees. He legitimately thinks that I'm trying to assert ownership over people and things when I use ""my"" to describe them.

This ended up causing a big fight earlier today when we walked to a pond with some ducks and I said something like ""It's my beautiful duckies!"" and he snapped at me and said am I actually that entitled to just claim ownership over everything that I like and that it sounded so immature and stupid every time I spoke like that.

I said ""when I say 'my' I'm not saying I literally own them, I'm referring to the love that I have for them"" and he said ""words have meaning, and when you say my you mean that you own them, you don't just get to change what words mean.""

151,1diibjh,AITA for asking mother to move out?,"AITA for asking my mother to move out?

For background, my mom (39) was an addict throughout my childhood. She (and her boyfriends/husbands) put my siblings and I through a lot of abuse, neglect, and trauma. Fortunately, in my early adulthood she got clean and decided she wanted to repair our relationship. 

About a year ago she was completely homeless and had nowhere to go (due to strict probation rules she’s on). So stupidly, I allowed her to come stay with my husband, sibling (her child), my child, and I so she could get a job and rent a room somewhere. I paid to add her to my lease so we didn’t get in trouble with our landlord. I even paid some of her bills and gave her money for babysitting for a while. 

Fast forward a year, there is no job and the only plan is her banking on eventually qualifying for disability then moving out.. 

I managed to live with my mom for almost a year without any of the trauma resurfacing. That is until I was told she was stealing money from my elderly grandmothers account about a month ago. Since then, I have been in what feels like constant fight or flight with her. Every small lie or selfish behavior of hers is enough to completely send me over the edge. 

She does occasionally help out by cleaning, cooking, and babysitting my child (she is great with them). However, she does not contribute financially and consistently asks me for money, food, rides, etc. She struggles to follow my boundaries but does make an effort. She really has tried to make things right in her own way. 

My marriage has really suffered - to the point where we separated for a few months because my husband felt my family (especially my mother) was taking advantage of us and it got really unhealthy. Now I’m trying to save my marriage and escape the trauma bond I have to my mom. I asked her to move today and she told me I’m putting her in a bad position all over again.. which is suppose is true. I fear she will soon end up back on drugs or in another abusive relationship and it will be all my fault..

* However the roomate insist on keeping doors and windows open to allow for ""air circulation"", especially when its hot.
* The way I see it, inviting hot air to allow for ""air circulation"" is worst than not having air circulation but a cooler ambient temperature. Having hot air circulation make no sense if the air is as hot, or hotter, than the heatwave outside.
* He refuses to buy a fan but money is not an object.
* He leaves doors and windows open when he's chilling outside, and when he's inside he keep his office door closed while gaming, *which prevent actual air circulation*.
* Additionally, allowing hot air to come in will cause heat to transmit to the walls, floor and ceiling, trapping it inside, and killing the ability of the apartment to cool. Yet he refuses to see that.

154,1dii4kc,AITA for asking for compromise in a child free wedding,"A sibling is getting married and asked my husband and I to be in the wedding (my husband being the best man). We have two small children, and the wedding is about 2 hours away from our home. The sibling did not state that it was a child free wedding, but it did end up turning out to be after much conversation and hurt feelings. 

We were told that our kids would need a sitter for the day as we would be both busy in the wedding party and that the kids could be present for the ceremony and reception but could not be with us while getting ready for the ceremony. This proves very difficult for us as we have no family or friends who are able to watch the kids. We are expected to be there at 7:00 a.m. to get ready for the wedding which will take place at 3:00 p.m. We proposed that perhaps we could come a bit later to the getting ready portion so that we could more easily find a sitter who would be available for that amount of time or we could get ready at home and show up to the wedding dressed and ready to go. They took great offense at this suggestion and became very upset with us. We pointed out that we are parents first and that we have obligations to our children and we can't just leave them with anyone. They said that this was their day and that we could be parents every day but this day would be about them. I am anxious about leaving my kids that far away as we have never left them with anyone for more than an hour or two before. She then chose to personally insult me by saying that I must have a ""bigger problem"" if I have anxiety around leaving my children with someone who isn't family. She is refusing to compromise on her day as she insists that she would be too anxious if we were to come later in order to accommodate a reasonable babysitter. I am at a loss on what to do. During this conversation they revealed to us that it is in fact a child free wedding which they had never disclosed before. They now no longer want the children at the ceremony at all and insist that saying that they could be there previously was just their means of compromising to make us feel better. I have no idea where to go from here. They are certainly within their rights to have a child free wedding, and if that had been communicated clealy to us we would have saved a lot of stepping on toes and hurt feelings that happened in this conversation. It is not okay for them to insist that we have to be there and we have to have child care for 18 plus hours that day. It is my opinion that if someone chooses to have a child free wedding, they are acknowledging and they must be okay with the fact that they are likely excluding a lot of couples that have children. They don't have the right to be upset when those couples choose not to attend. AITA if we don't attend the wedding of a sibling when our kids are not welcome. 

Edit to add: We are concerned about strained relationships and want to preserve this family relationship but their expectations do not seem reasonable or likely even possible. The wedding is still a year away. We are happy to come later and have a sitter but they want us there all day (leaving our house at 5am and returning after midnight) or I am not invited to be in the wedding any longer. Husband is still expected to be best man no matter what (in their opinion he can't say no). I feel alienated by their lack of compromise with us coming later and leaving the reception at a reasonable time in order to have a shorter term sitter. 

2nd edit: I was asked to be bridesmaid before I knew it was a child free wedding and that there would be a strict requirement for us to be there from 7:00 a.m. to past midnight. This would be the wedding of my husband's brother and his fiance. His brother is planning on asking him to be best man but has not formally asked him yet. Our proposal of coming later to get ready, around 11:00 a.m., was met with hostility.

155,1dii4a9,AITA for telling my autistic brother his favorite character should die? ,"CW: Mushoku Tensei spoilers and the questionable sexual themes therein

My (30F) brother, Kyle (32M), essentially lives the NEET life due to a mix of struggles including diagnosed autism. He's never had a job, never dated, still lives with our mom while I live a (kind of) normal life. So it's no surprise that Kyle's fixated on Mushoku Tensei. 

The show's about Rudeus, a NEET who is reincarnated into a magical world and achieves all the things he yearned to in his former life. It covers important things like PTSD, but it's also excruciatingly uncomfortable as Rudeus is constantly ogling women, stealing underwear, making lewd action figures, etc etc etc. I've tried to sit through it because it means a ton to Kyle, but it got even worse at the end of the first season when Rudeus lost his virginity. NOT a scene I want to watch with family to begin with, but it's also uncomfortable how the girl seems to freeze up and get quiet, something I relate to as a people pleaser getting convinced into things I don't want to do. 

Once the second season was in full swing, it wasn't just Rudeus. He now has a pervy best friend obsessed with figurines, and two furry lackies which commit their own hijinks. The new love interest, Sylphie, is just as frigid and nervous, which raises so many red flags. I told Kyle I didn't want to watch the show anymore, but he's been asking every time I visit. 

The first time Kyle asked why I wouldn't watch the show, I said the sex scenes made me uncomfortable. The second time, I said Rudeus is really messed up and Sylphie's clearly forcing herself to have sex so he won't leave. Kyle accused me of projecting, said he couldn't believe I'd say that about the characters, and it became immediately obvious Kyle thinks of these characters as real people. He's an autistic NEET and by insulting these characters, I'm pretty much insulting him.

But he kept asking. And here's where I might be the asshole. Today I said the show's disgusting and creepy, that half the characters should have been deleted before the story started. I'd happily never talk about the show again, but here we are. 

But I forgot in the moment that this is my brother's one lifeline, a story of a NEET getting to live his best life when there are not a lot of stories like that in fiction or real life. These weird, pervy characters are as close as he has to friends.

159,1dihnt0,AITA? Am I the Problem?,"Married 11 yrs (together 13) 32f to 41m with 15f step daughter and 7f.

Note-I am the primary parent due to work/life schedules

15f has a history of lying, stealing (usually only from myself or 7f,) and gaslighting. 

For Mother’s Day, I was given a small gift that I kept on an end table until I wanted to use.

15f was going on a trip, and I was packing her things. She needed her wallet, and brought it to me to organize. Inside was part of said gift. I confronted right away and she said her friend gave her part of that exact gift. I said not possible bc she wasn’t with said friend in over 2 wks. Look on end table and she has taken 2/3 of said gift. She doubles down and then says I gave it to her (never happened, didn’t even know it was missing until she brought me her wallet.)

I am upset, husband seems to not be concerned. I bring it up a couple times that day that I am not okay with this continuously happening and it’s started to wear on me. He tells me to just ignore her. I said that’s not easy when you’re the one these things are happening to. He then says “well, what do you want me to do about it?” I said I wanted this shit to stop. He then decided to go to bed. 

Next day, 15f asked me to do something for her which I declined. She told me I was being rude and that I should just get over it bc it’s in the past. At this time, yes I was rude. 

Am I the problem here? Should I have just let it go? Because at this point I feel it’s more likely I’m the problem than both of them.

160,1dihcdj,AITA for hiding my wealth from my family?,"Throwaway account because I don’t know who lurks my main. I am 34 oldest of 5 and am married with 1 kid. My wife and I keep our finances separate. She knows I have money but I don’t think she realizes how much I have put away over the years. 

My siblings, in-laws, and parents are awful with money. They buy a new vehicle every couple of years they can barely afford, spend money on unnecessary stuff and vacations. Recently my sister told me her car is 3 months behind and and she keeps borrowing money from my parents to pay it. My parents told me they maxed out their credit card and aren’t sure how to go about it. They didn’t mention the amount, my in laws said money is tight and are 4 months behind on their mortgage. My brother says he defaulted on a $4k loan that sounded like a predatory loan. 

It makes me sick to think about especially when they confide in me these things, and I feel like I should help them because I can but I worry about being taken advantage of.

I also feel like they put themselves in these situations, my parents have plenty of “toys” (boats, kayaks, 2x campers, etc) they could sell, my in laws both drive very expensive SUVs including a new BMW X5. My sister put a whole trip overseas on a credit card. I watch them spend money in shops. One has 4-6 Stanley water bottles because they want colors to match their outfit. 

Meanwhile I have everything paid off besides the house. I have $82k in savings $250k in 401k. My income is very good and I think my family suspects that because they know what I do for work.. I was planning on continuing to save and buy a Boxster cash (obviously keep some left over)

But my guilt factor is telling me I should help family before getting fancy car I’ve been wanting. I would hate for my in-laws to lose the house and have my nieces and nephews on the street or worse while I drive a new car around, I also (as bad as it sounds) don’t want anyone moving in with me. 

Edit: I am glad to see I’m not the ATA for this. Me criticizing them in my head makes me feel like a jerk. 

Another edit: I guess I realized I complained more about their spending and didn’t really mention the other stuff going on. They have issues like a furnace that “broke” and only works at 30% so their house gets super cold during the winter, so much so they had blankets everywhere and move the kids downstairs, my nieces and nephews have medical things that have not being taken care of, they miss out on after school activities because no one can pay for it. If my sister loses the car she loses her ability to get to work as she chose to move to a big city where she knows no one and has a 45 min commute to work. If anything the guilt mainly comes from not taking care of my nieces and nephews and blaming their parents.  

And I just don’t want people to be homeless, about 14 years ago I slept in my car for a month during winter with only $100 in my bank account while I tried to save up for a deposit for an apartment. I only made $8.75 an hour then. It was miserable, cold, embarrassing, I remember going to kwik trip for hot food because I was tired of protein bars, bread and peanut butter, these teens hit my car with snowballs and ice waking me up once and then were like “oh shit someone is sleeping in there” and said other things that made me sick. 

I know I didn’t give out too much information but I was kinda surprised about being criticized for my own actions. To answer some questions/concerns: yes I have a 529 setup for the kid. They are 4 and they are set, even if college rates continue to rise. The company I worked for paid 3 years of my college and it was a tremendous help. It’s not my money so I didn’t list it. I have $40k in non liqued assets. I make $175k a year which included a $50k raise I got 3 years ago and I never changed my spending habits. It helped me greatly build my savings in both my retirement and normal life and pay off the truck and camper. I owe less than $190k on a $300k home. The boxster is a plan which the kid is in school and I am not paying $1k a month in childcare I don’t plan on blowing all my savings on, more than likely used $40k-$50k. Some may think pay off the house or that’s it’s stupid to buy but I’m a big car enthusiast and it would great to own. Also it’s not a Boxster, it’s something else but I worry someone would catch on because I’ve talked about it a lot. My wife and I have been together 10 years, we’ve kept finances separate. Both of our parents have fought about money or made it a big deal so we stick with separate. She Venmo’s me half the mortgage and utilities every month. I cover groceries and childcare in full. It works. We do have a joint account we put money into for house/child stuff that comes up. I have an HSA I opened for medicial bills and put money into every paycheck. Every medical bill that has come up that account has covered. My company matches a good amount too.

She's just had 7 weeks off work and has seen them twice. We are also in the middle of moving house. I offered to have her over early on in her time off but she was busy. 

We then went over for what was meant to be a joint 2nd and 30th birthday for my son and me but she had only told people that it was for my son. So not only did I watch my son open a bunch of presents while there was as nothing for me but my mum got upset when I wanted to be the one to blow out the candles with my son. At this point we had been doing regular video calls but I was hurt and they stopped. 

Fast forward to the day of my actual birthday and she was pissed off because I already had plans and she wanted to come over only attempting to set this up like an hour before she wanted to come. She ended up coming the following day when I excitedly told her we had found a new rental after our current one had said we wouldn't be able to renew our lease. I haven't heard from her since and we have been busy packing in every spare moment we have. The only spare moments are when the toddler is napping or after he's gone to bed for the night so it's been very difficult on a short time crunch. 

My mum is pissed that I haven't brought the kids over during her time off despite knowing we were moving and hasn't checked in with how we're going with it. I don't drive and even if I did we can only afford one car which my husband uses to get to and from work and I'm currently a SAHM. To get to hers and back would mean 2 hours out of my day just in travel time plus whatever time we spend there realistically meaning my toddler would nap in the pram on the bus ride home and I'd have no packing time. I wouldn't expect my mum to come and help pack but if she wanted to spend time with the grandkids she could have come over, would have been here in ten minutes instead of the hour one way it would take me, and been able to entertain them while I packed. But apparently having to call in advance before she comes makes it too much effort. 

Now she's called me today to see if I'm available during her last week off work and I've said no as we are moving tomorrow and she's pissed off at me for not having any free time.

163,1digx2w,AITA for not sharing food with my mom?,"I (19M) am home from college for the summer. My mom (54F) wasn't feeling too good today, so I decided to ask some friends if they were down to go to Wingstop to get food.

Prior to leaving, I informed my mom and told her that I would be back before the curfew she set for me (11:00PM) and she asked me (in an almost joking sort of manner) if I would bring her back any food. I asked her if she wanted any corn, chicken or vegetable sticks but she declined so I just went off on my way.

My friends and I drove to Wingstop, and I ordered a 3 tender combo for around 16 bucks (which is quite expensive for food, but we were going to wingstop so I decided to bite the bullet). I drove around a little bit with friends, then came back around 10:30.

I went to take my food up to my room because I don't really feel comfortable eating this type of food in front of my mom. She has shamed me and called me ""shapeless"" and asked if i was diabetic because I've been eating more. I have been chronically underweight my entire life, and I started to put on lean muscle and bulk up a little bit. My mom then calls me down, telling me she knows that I have food and that I should show her what I got. I go downstairs, open up my food, and my mom almost snatches a tender right out of the box and almost eats all of it. I get upset, and verbally tell her to give me the tender back (because I spent a lot of my own money on it, and that she didn't want food in the first place). Personally, I could eat 5 tenders but I'm currently trying to cut down a little so I only ordered 3. She waves it away from me, calling me selfish in a joking sort of way. I haven't eaten since noon, so I tell her to just leave the tender and that she can have some of my corn and veggie sticks, but I feel like she was just taunting me and waving it away from me every time I reached for it back. She does take some corn, but doesn't let go of the chicken. I then take the tender back from her hands, and she just goes silently angry. She turns off all the lights in the kitchen and living room and lays on the couch almost as if to guilt me, covering herself with a blanket like a child (which is ridiculous considering her age). I immediately feel bad, part of me feeling like I am greedy so I go over and tell her she can have the rest of the tender she ate and that I was sorry. She just started screaming at me, telling me that I was selfish and ungrateful and that ""now she knows what type of horrible human she's raised"". The reason why I wasn't going to share with her in the first place was because she didn't want it, and now that she suddenly changed her mind and was going to eat some of my corn and chicken I was going to be hungry because I ordered less than I would've normally because again, I'm trying to cut.

I (19M) am home from college for the summer. My mom (54F) wasn't feeling too good today, so I decided to ask some friends if they were down to go to Wingstop to get food.

Prior to leaving, I informed my mom and told her that I would be back before the curfew she set for me (11:00PM) and she asked me (in an almost joking sort of manner) if I would bring her back any food. I asked her if she wanted any corn, chicken or vegetable sticks but she declined so I just went off on my way.

My friends and I drove to Wingstop, and I ordered a 3 tender combo for around 16 bucks (which is quite expensive for food, but we were going to wingstop so I decided to bite the bullet). I drove around a little bit with friends, then came back around 10:30.

I went to take my food up to my room because I don't really feel comfortable eating this type of food in front of my mom. She has shamed me and called me ""shapeless"" and asked if i was diabetic because I've been eating more. I have been chronically underweight my entire life, and I started to put on lean muscle and bulk up a little bit. My mom then calls me down, telling me she knows that I have food and that I should show her what I got. I go downstairs, open up my food, and my mom almost snatches a tender right out of the box and almost eats all of it. I get upset, and verbally tell her to give me the tender back (because I spent a lot of my own money on it, and that she didn't want food in the first place). Personally, I could eat 5 tenders but I'm currently trying to cut down a little so I only ordered 3. She waves it away from me, calling me selfish in a joking sort of way. I haven't eaten since noon, so I tell her to just leave the tender and that she can have some of my corn and veggie sticks, but I feel like she was just taunting me and waving it away from me every time I reached for it back. She does take some corn, but doesn't let go of the chicken. I then take the tender back from her hands, and she just goes silently angry. She turns off all the lights in the kitchen and living room and lays on the couch almost as if to guilt me, covering herself with a blanket like a child (which is ridiculous considering her age). I immediately feel bad, part of me feeling like I am greedy so I go over and tell her she can have the rest of the tender she ate and that I was sorry. She just started screaming at me, telling me that I was selfish and ungrateful and that ""now she knows what type of horrible human she's raised"".

164,1digvwn,AITA or is my teenagers friend ungrateful? ,"AITA? Wondering if we are too strict to our 14 year old?

We just got back from a family vacation and let our 14 year old bring a friend. When we dropped the girl off at home after we returned she did not say goodbye or thank you, but just walked inside her house. I asked my daughter if she was okay and my daughter said her friend thinks our family rules are weird. Her two specific examples were: 1. We were vacationing in northern Wisconsin and the kids were swimming in Lake Superior. I wouldn’t let the older girls go too far out bc the water was cold and I had no way of telling when it got deeper. My two younger kids (9 and 6) were closer to the shore with me. I let the older girls go farther than the younger kids, but I also had to remind them quite a few times to come back closer to the shoreline. I tried to give them space and let them have fun, but apparently I was too strict.
2. We were eating dinner in a restaurant and the friend had her phone out. Our family rule is no phones at the table, so my husband asked  her to put it away while we ate. She removed it, but then pulled it back out later while we were still eating and started watching Tik Tok, so my husband said, “We’re still eating.”
 I prob would not have said anything, but I also understand why he did. My daughter tells me all the time we are too strict, and maybe we are, but I don’t see anything here that would make someone think we are “weird”. 
We also apparently suck bc we don’t let her go to her boyfriends house to watch movies with him. Maybe I’m old school (I’m 45) but 14 seems so young to do this! 
I’m really struggling with mindfully raising a teenager to be courteous and to have rules that often don’t align with other parents, but I do really want kids to feel welcomed by us. Any advice would be great! TYIA!

166,1digkjc,WIBTA for banning the father of my child from seeing our kids,"I (f24) want to ban my baby daddy (m26) from seeing our kids. When i was 18 i got pregnant and we had our daughter. We were together on and off but it was a rocky relationship. In 2020 i got pregnant with my son. Our relationship when i was pregnant with our son was extremely toxic. 

A few weeks before giving birth he decided to move out. This is when he started to disappear. My mom was in the hospital with me when i had him, he barely made it in time to sign papers to be on the birth certificate. He visited a few times when he was a newborn but it slowly started becoming less and less. He does have a problem with drugs, but I’ve been very considerate so i would meet him places for him to spend time with them. Them being alone with him is not something i was comfortable with because he lives with people i don’t know. 

He always goes all out for my daughter birthday showing up and bringing her a bunch of gifts. On my sons first birthday  he showed up with 0 presents. On my sons 2nd he didn’t show up at all. This year on my daughters birthday i said he can come only if he remembers our son. 

On Friday we made plans for him to come today and take him to Chuck E. Cheese and bring gifts. I texted him to confirm and he said sorry i can’t make it got called into work. (This is confusing to me because child support cannot find his job. I have not gotten child support in over a year) anyways when he texted me the work thing it was extremely last minute and i said are you kidding me and he completely ignored me.
