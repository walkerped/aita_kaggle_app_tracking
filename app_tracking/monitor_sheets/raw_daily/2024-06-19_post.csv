0,1dj89nw,AITA for yelling at my dad when he let the dog loose?,"(Sorry for the grammar, I'm still shaken)  
For background, my father and I's relationship has become strained. He recently found out I'm trans (FTM) and told me if I ""continue with this path"" he would leave me and my mother. He also tried to guilt trip me by showing him his paycheck and said that me and my mother would not be able to survive without him.

Last year, me and my family were carrying groceries into the house. My dog (then a five-month-old puppy) went between his legs. He opened them and our dog ran out into the street. I live on one of the busiest streets in my town. My brother got her inside, and I broke down in tears. My father told me I was overreacting and said ""It's just a dog.""

Jump to today: My dad was doing yard work and left the back gate open. I was outside with my mom and noticed it was open just before my dog opened it and ran out. She ran out of the house and was very close to being hit by a car before I managed to get her back in our backyard. I came back to make sure both of our gates were closed.

This is the most important part to me, I returned to my dad having a grin on his face. It looked like he wanted to laugh, and it got me even more mad. I yelled at him ""It's not funny"" before storming into the house. I love my dog so much, and seeing her nearly get hit twice was terrifying. I know I probably shouldn't have yelled, but this is the second time she was let out due to his recklessness.

After around 10 minutes, my dad came back to yell at me saying he worked so hard to clean up the yard and accidentally left the gate open. He never once apologized. I get accidents happen, but I tell him all the time to be careful and that she will run out. Every time I try and warn him about something that could easily happen, he brushes me off and says I'm overreacting. Both times this had happened, he blamed either me or my brother for chasing her (trying to get her inside). My whole problem is that he didn't seem to care at all. He didn't care how I felt, or how something he cherishes could've ended up hurt. Was I overreacting?",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-06-19,"AITA for yelling at my dad when he let the dog loose?

2,1dj7df8,AITA? I am losing my mind. ,"I have never imagined that I would be posting on here to get some guidance but after years of reading others posts and getting some form of relief, I am finally breaking down to try and figure out what to do‚Ä¶

(This is a long one) 

I am in a very specialized and lucrative profession. So is my wife. We have been married 7 years just this past May and were together before our wedding for three years. When we met, we were already both in our respective professions. 

I know my profession has not been easy on her. It requires constant travel and sometimes longer trips over seas. I have always come home and ‚Äúmade it work‚Äù professionally, as long as possible, while I didn‚Äôt have to go elsewhere for work. The pay for the work ‚Äúnearby‚Äù (over 50 miles away) is a fraction of what I get paid for actually doing my job where there is real work to be done. 

We live in a remote area that isn‚Äôt bustling with opportunity. Due to my specialty, there is absolutely no one that will hire me nearby, believe me I‚Äôve tried. I am either too expensive or they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what to do with me‚Äù and won‚Äôt even give me a chance. 

So what happens is an opportunity will present itself and I will ultimately be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to take it because by that point I‚Äôve been hanging on by a thread to get by. Whenever the job takes me elsewhere, (yes it sucks because I hate being away from my family) my wife is suddenly a single mom and I am a geo bachelor but she never complains about being able to afford everything she wants and needs. When I am home and struggling, of course money becomes a huge fight because she is now the bread winner and is working all the time to try and make up the difference.  It‚Äôs been really tough on both of us in either circumstance. 

Another part that is beyond me is how she never seems to appreciate the fact that when I am home, she is able to keep her job due to the fact that taking our boys to school now 100% falls on me because she works 12 hour shifts and is at work very early and gets home after school has been closed for hours. Never once has she seemed to take into account that I have constantly adjusted my position in my career field to better suit this fact but yet she still has the same exact position and is holding on to it for dear life. 

She is in a demanding profession as well and when we met we both stated that this was important to us; that we both continue to work in our professions that we are proud of. I never imagined having a stay at home wife and she didn‚Äôt ever expect me to be the sole ‚Äúbread winner‚Äù so we have both continued working in our fields. Right now I am currently away from home for work again and she is struggling to keep it all together. This TDY is paying me handsomely to the point she has been able to hire a babysitter for the evenings and takes the boys to school very very early (which is obviously an additional challenge) and I know it‚Äôs tough on her but she is very well taken care of and I‚Äôll be home in a month. 

So here is the dilemma‚Ä¶. 

After 10 years of being together, we have both excelled in our professions. She has never had to travel for work and I always have. So where we are right now is after I return home from this, I have a  position in my profession that will allow me to never have to travel again. The only problem is that it isn‚Äôt near home. We have to move. 

It would mean I can continue to work professionally (and she could as well) and never have to go elsewhere to continue to advance. Home and work would be in the same place. I will also be making enough that she won‚Äôt have to work right away once we move (to give her time to settle in and look for jobs on her own time and get to know the area). She wants to return to work but it‚Äôs nice we won‚Äôt be in dire straits for her to contribute financially. But all she wants to do now is (literally) tell me how narcissistic I am and how I am ‚Äúforcing her‚Äù to leave everything behind for my job and that I am putting my job first and my family second. She has told me this with animosity at least 50 times. 

She is packing the house and planning to move but she is torturing my mind and soul about this whole thing. At the same time she has constantly complained how none of our family (her family lives 4 hours away and mine is 1 hour away) or friends (from life, work, or church) have been there for her but she is holding it against me that I am making her leave all that behind. I don‚Äôt know what to do or say anymore. She makes me feel absolutely insane and helpless. ALL I want is to have my family with me AND be able to do my job so I can continue to take care of us and give us the life we want. Now I can and she is acting like I am her sworn mortal enemy. Please help. I really don‚Äôt know what to say to put her in a better mental state about all this. I am also lost as to why she is making it so torturous on me. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. It‚Äôs like she is trying to sabotage the entire plan but somehow make it my fault because I lost composure dealing with the nonsense of all her irrational emotions. I have tried extremely hard to be patient but I am at a point where I just completely shut down and let her tear me apart but I have no idea of what else to do about it.

3,1dj7bcq,AITA for making my mom ‚Äúsound homophobic‚Äù in front of her coworker?,"Sorry this is on mobile.
My mom forced me out of the closet multiple times when I was younger, yelling at me and telling me I couldn't be gay because I hadn't dated.
She thought talking about this in the McDonald‚Äôs drive-thru in front of my brother was the best time and place to bring this up.
I felt super uncomfortable and just lied about being straight because I didn‚Äôt want my brother giving me shit for it while we were at school.

my official ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù‚Äù was her,my aunt and my cousin basically interrogating me because I looked at rainbow merchandise in a store when I was around 16-17.
They then tried to pick apart if i was ‚Äúreally gay‚Äù. 

She was then surprised I didn‚Äôt feel safe coming out to her, and literally pretended she never yelled at me the last few times she forced me out of the closet. 

Any time I brought up the past, she says they never happened or I‚Äôm remembering it incorrectly, or brought up what I told her in middle-school.
Eventually I just stopped bringing it up because it became pointless.

These past few years, she‚Äôs been asking me to go to Pride or to strip clubs with her.
The thought of going to either of those with her makes me so uncomfortable.

She brought it up again at the dinner and I said ‚Äúno thanks, I‚Äôd really rather not.‚Äù
She kept pressing on about it and her coworker and her wife joined in.
Saying it would be fun and that maybe I‚Äôd find a partner there, there‚Äôs tons of activities,etc.

I kept trying to explain I just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable,
but they kept bringing up different alternative pride events and pressing on about it.
eventually I just got pissed off and yelled at my mom;
‚ÄúYou literally forced me out of the closet several times when I was younger and insisted I was straight, all because of something I told you when I was 13. I didn‚Äôt tell you I was gay because you had me cornered and scared. The thought of going to pride with you makes me feel so anxious and gross I‚Äôd rather die. You haven‚Äôt apologized to me for the shitty things you told me, you don‚Äôt get to join me for the fun things to look good in front of your friends.‚Äù

Her coworker and her wife just gave my mom a ‚Äúwtf‚Äù look, because obviously mom would never tell them about something like that.

Dinner was cut short,we split the bills and  they left.

We got into an argument in the car on the way, and she said I need to ‚Äústop making up shit to make her sound homophobic‚Äù.
I told her she needs to own up to what she did to me

Things have been tense around our house lately, and I avoid her when she‚Äôs home, otherwise it‚Äôs another argument.

I might be the AH because I could‚Äôve made up another excuse or waited till we got home before I said anything and embarrassed her. Her coworker seems super uncomfortable around her and it might be affecting her social life at work.
At the same time, I feel glad I confronted her about this in front of someone else that wasn‚Äôt from our family.

5,1dj7712,AITA for not eating my mom‚Äôs food and leaving it untouched because of my diet? ,"For context, I‚Äôm Latina. My mom loves cooking, she‚Äôs retired now and it has become her new passion to make everything from scratch, bread, burgers, pasta anything. She‚Äôs pretty good at it, and always trying new things. The problem is, she will force you to eat and guilty trip you or scream at you that she‚Äôll never cook again if you don‚Äôt 

I‚Äôm slightly overweight, trying to lose weight. I‚Äôm 20 years old, live with my parents because uni in my country does not have dorms. I feel pressured to appease to all her whims, since they‚Äôre paying for my education. I don‚Äôt go out, I don‚Äôt drink and I only study and work. 
I haven‚Äôt gotten my license yet because where I live the process to get your license is almost 6,000 dollars (if you do the currency exchange) so I don‚Äôt have the means to do that currently, and I also suck at driving.

This means that she drives me to the few places I go when I go out, including the gym.
She usually holds that over my head when I don‚Äôt want to eat her second serving of food, or even a serving of some caloric meal she made, saying she won‚Äôt take me anymore.
I‚Äôm prohibited from using Uber, as it is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù even if I have some money from my internship.

I can take the bus; but when I do she also guilty trips me as it being me rejecting her or something.

Today she made burgers, two even though I only said I wanted one when she asked me how many. This is almost 1000 calories, when I just came back from the gym. I got upset and refused to eat, she made a whole show and the dinner got awkward and quiet.
I feel awful, she does basically everything to me and worked her whole life for me to have a comfortable house and life, and is also paying for my education.

It felt awful leaving the food untouched on the table, specially because it will go to the trash and that‚Äôs wasteful.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-19,"AITA for not eating my mom‚Äôs food and leaving it untouched because of my diet?  For context, I‚Äôm Latina. My mom loves cooking, she‚Äôs retired now and it has become her new passion to make everything from scratch, bread, burgers, pasta anything. She‚Äôs pretty good at it, and always trying new things. The problem is, she will force you to eat and guilty trip you or scream at you that she‚Äôll never cook again if you don‚Äôt 

I‚Äôm slightly overweight, trying to lose weight. I‚Äôm 20 years old, live with my parents because uni in my country does not have dorms. I feel pressured to appease to all her whims, since they‚Äôre paying for my education. I don‚Äôt go out, I don‚Äôt drink and I only study and work. 
I haven‚Äôt gotten my license yet because where I live the process to get your license is almost 6,000 dollars (if you do the currency exchange) so I don‚Äôt have the means to do that currently, and I also suck at driving.

This means that she drives me to the few places I go when I go out, including the gym.
She usually holds that over my head when I don‚Äôt want to eat her second serving of food, or even a serving of some caloric meal she made, saying she won‚Äôt take me anymore.
I‚Äôm prohibited from using Uber, as it is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù even if I have some money from my internship.

I can take the bus; but when I do she also guilty trips me as it being me rejecting her or something.

Today she made burgers, two even though I only said I wanted one when she asked me how many. This is almost 1000 calories, when I just came back from the gym. I got upset and refused to eat, she made a whole show and the dinner got awkward and quiet.
I feel awful, she does basically everything to me and worked her whole life for me to have a comfortable house and life, and is also paying for my education.

6,1dj6wa2,AITA for arguing with my aunt because she said that my mom was stealing her money?,"So first off a bit of background,

I'm 19M and live with my mom and grandma in my grandma's house in Sri Lanka. my aunts in the USA. My father was abusive and we don't contact him anymore. So since I was little my aunt has been sending money to us for Grandma's medical bills, my school fees, and living costs. she has been doing this every month for 14 years.

Recently my grandma's condition worsened and the spent on her medical bills rose, our family is insanely religious (we are Buddhist but we worship Hindu gods too), so because her condition worsened and because of aunt's own problems she has in her life she asked us to go to a Hindu priest so that he can tell the gods to fix our problems and this costs a lot of money too for travel expenses and other things for the ritual. we have been going there every week for 3 months. so obviously the money that she sent gets spent fast after living costs.

so now the problem is, because the money is being spent fast she has created an idea in her head that my mom is stealing money from her so that she can spend the money on her own. and they have been fighting about this for 3 months and now my other aunt (mom's little sister) has been fueling the fire saying that my mom is stealing money from her. I don't believe my mom is stealing the money but I checked anyway for 2 months and found no evidence of stealing.

today aunt sent money to us and asked me to monitor the spending of her money. so I did. After getting groceries, Grandma's medicine, travel expenses, and paying the water bill that was meant to be paid by my uncle but I guess he's tight on money because he hasn't even called yet. My uncle paying the water bill was started 2 months ago because aunt said he needs to contribute to grandma. and I pay the electricity bill since 5 months ago. I sent receipts to her today and she blew up at me and Mom (mostly Mom) for paying for the water. (i know im the asshole here because i should have asked her first before paying the water bill).

So just now i had a big argument with her over text because she was saying that my mom was stealing her money and i said that she don't need to pay anything anymore because ill pay for everything from now on. Then she said if i can pay for everything give back the money she sent on in those 14 years. After that i clearly you don't want to fix the problem so im stopping responding.

Don't get me wrong, i truly appreciate what she has done all these years but accusing my mom of stealing and trying to throw her out of the house, when she did nothing wrong just pissed me off. My mom literally took care of me and grandma for 14 years and still does to this day.

It was convenient for him to go to this city because his current girlfriend was living there for university. 

So after asking me to come out with him around a week before we go, I decided to tell him I didn‚Äôt want to go.

I had planned to go to my other best friends birthday, Bradley (where we would drink at his). 
And the last time i went out with him and his girlfriend i felt very much I was third wheeling

He would pay for my drinks, drive me there and pay for my coach back (he was going to stay with his girlfriend for the weekend) 
He would get me back in time to be at Bradley‚Äôs by walking me up. 
He brought another friend so i didn‚Äôt third wheel.

I loved the effort but i decided that I didn‚Äôt want to go even with those solutions in place so then he accepted. 

Come the Friday (the day we were supposed to go out) I went into work, now usually i work from home but it was our last day as a team together before we all got separated so we agreed to come in. My manager said she paid for us all to go bowling after work so I thought what the hell, I may as well go. 

The evening got away from me as we started to have a few drinks which most were bought for me. We ended up getting a little drunk and talking shit until maybe about 12/1am which i don‚Äôt think is too late for my standard

12,1dj6g5d,AITA For not cancelling my guys trip?,"I (35M) and my wife (31F) recently began construction on a new home. Thankfully everything has gone smoothly and we are nearing the completion on the home. Our closing date is set and we are scheduled to get the keys to the brand new house in the next couple of weeks. 

Unfortunately - I have a scheduled vacation the week of our closing date. 

This trip of mine is a guys trip that is annual. Every year the guys and I rent a cabin and spend a Wednesday - Sunday board gaming. Our closing day falls on the Friday of my trip. What I plan to do is drive home to complete the closing and sign all the paperwork (it is only about an hour drive) then drive back to rejoin the rest of my group. This trip was planned well in advance - before we ever began construction on our home - and  has long since been paid for. 

Here is the issue: My wife wants me to go to my trip on Wednesday and then leave my trip Friday, cancelling the rest of the vacation and not returning to the rest of the group. She wants me to be present for the move-in. While I completely understand not wanting to move into a house by yourself - I have already gotten this taken care of. I have arranged for a friend of mine who owns a moving company to complete the moving of our stuff into the new home. I have also arranged for TV's to be hung, mirrors to be hung, curtains to be hung, internet to be installed, etc. All of this is scheduled. My wife is very angry with me that I won't cancel my trip and I think it is unreasonable for her to ask me to cancel. This is the one opportunity I get every year to get together with my guy friends to do something we love and it is important to me. I have tried to explain that to her, but she says I am leaving her hanging. Of course it sucks our closing was scheduled in the middle of the trip but that isn't something I could help.

15,1dj66dg,AITA for arguing with my brother because he is unwilling to help at a mass service?,"I (17Nb) had an argument earlier today with my brother ""Oak"" (17M). For context, one of our cousins died at the end of May, and my family was devastated. Our aunt especially, since she was his mother and saw him pass.

Onto the main story. Our aunt wants me and Oak to help out at the mass. No big deal, I'm more than willing to help, and I know Oak is too. The only thing is, our aunt wants us to set up a table for the mass, which means we would have to walk up in front of the group of people attending and place the items for the mass on the table. It would take less than a minute.

I was perfectly okay with this. No big deal, just place items on a table and sit down. Oak, however, was not so okay with it. Our grandma asked him first, because our aunt was messaging her about it rather than us. Oak told her no, that he would not do it. So our grandma told me about it, and I said I would talk to him about it.

Oak had to deal with really bad anxiety all his life, which I understand. My anxiety isn't the best either, and I used to be like him with how I responded to situations. But he told me he refuses to do it because he would ""feel awkward/uncomfortable in front of the crowd."" This is the same brother who dances in front of a crowd 10√ó larger for over five minutes at a time without much worry.

We argued about this. I expressed how I wished he would willingly do it, and how this isn't about him, it's about our cousin. I asked him to do it for our aunt, since I know she will be in shambles at the mass. And I said our aunt doesn't have a lot of options, since the mass is in three days.

He said I was making him out to be a bad person, which I never said nor implied. When he said that, I apologized for how he was taking my words, but that how he was taking it was not how I was meaning it.

He is unwilling to move from his stance and it pains me, especially since our aunt is under a lot of stress because of everything that's happened and could use the help, which I also expressed to Oak. I wish he would be willing to be uncomfortable for a minute for her, or better yet, realize the situation is not about him and no one cares that we will be putting the items down.

AITA?

EDIT: I never said I'm forcing him to do this. Our grandma told him he has to in the end, but I told her I would do it by myself if he still doesn't want to.

EDIT 2: Seeing the comments made me realize I was in the wrong. I apologized to him and he said it's fine. I explained how I said it's not about him, but made it about him, and that was a dick move. I also told him personally I'd be okay doing this by myself, he doesn't have to push himself, and hurting himself for the sake of someone else's happiness, at least in this situation, is not fair to him. I offered to make it up to him, and he said there's no need.

ETA: I called my brother several times but he never told me when he'd be back even if I asked him.

ETA 2: I will apologize to both friends and accept the judgment of being TA. All this info on cats is new to me so I'll take it into account when something like this happens next time although my parents will insist I take care of him. I shouldn't have wasted their time and canceled when time wasn't on my side. We did cancel but at 12 and friend 2 willingly went even after we canceled.",3.0,1.0693182945251465,1,0
21,1djxa3k,WIBTA if I cancel a gathering because of my BIL?,"My husband (31M) and I (29F) gather with some friends every year at our house for a silly celebration of our dogs birthdays. It's a normal friend gathering with food and cake, music, just for fun and we plan it out with everyone in advance to find a day everyone can come together, to order enough food for everyone and get all the preparations ready. We've been doing this for 3 years now. Our gathering is planned for this Saturday and majority of our friends have confirmed presence, but about two days ago my BIL (29M) was admited into a psychiatric hospital due to a mental breakdown. 

Ever since, my in laws and my husband have been dealing with the aftermath for the most part (I can't be of much help during the day because I am at work and my husband works from home, I don't.) This has been taking a toll on everyone mentally and I feel terrible seeing my husband and his family go through this again, since my BIL has been in and out of this facility multiple times over the years due to severe depression and some other mental health issues. 

I told my husband I wanted to cancel the gathering, because I think the moment is not right for it anymore. We're dealing with some delicate matters and I think a party right now makes no sense. But he told me that we should do it anyway because it might be a good distraction and that he can't keep stopping his life every time his brother needs help. He said he can handle everything. 

Today, however, I asked him to order the food tomorrow for the gathering and he had an almost meltdown about how he doesn't want to talk to anyone or handle any of these things because he already has his hands full with his brother and his parents and I always take care of organizing everything anyway and this is too difficult for him right now. After proding a bit more, he confided in me that he's trying to put a brave front for his parents, but he's in tatters about the situation and he's worried his brother might do something stupid and he's worried sick for his mother because of it and everything is too much right now. 

I brought up again that we should cancel the gathering so he can focus on his family, because I don't want to party at our house when I see how down he's feeling and that I'm down too because I don't like seeing him like this and there's very little we can do about the whole situation. He got mad, saying that I don't need to cancel anything because I really was looking forward to it and that he'll do his best to have a good time, but after he told me how he's truly feeling, I'd rather just spend the weeked just the two of us so he can rest and be with his family. He told me again I shouldn't cancel because of this.

But now I really don't want to do it anymore. I'm planning on messaging our friends tomorrow and cancel the plans. I'm not in the mood to bring friends to our house for the both of us to entertain when we're dealing with everything else, but he was pretty upset at the idea of me calling it quits.

22,1djx1i7,AITA for telling my roommate that she doesn't deserve more than 10% ($5k) if we can win $50k in our negligence lawsuit,"Fake names
I (Ann, F 20) and girlfriend Brianna(F 21) live with Catherine (F 24, Brianna's cousin). We live in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment. Brianna and I live in one room and Catherine lives in the other room and the kitchen and living room separate our bedroom.Our apartment had a leak (they thought they fixed it multiple times) that started 4 months ago and then our walls started growing mold for the last 3 months (they wiped the walls each time they ""fixed"" the leak). After 1 month of multiple ""fixes"" we started seeing mold grow up the walls and it then traveled into our closet. So we packed our stuff that didn't get damaged into boxes and and moved everything into the living room. The only thing that stayed in our room/closet was our bed. Brianna and I set up code inspections through the city and they reported everything, visiting on multiple occasions. Then I also paid for mold testing that of course required fumigation. The apartment complex refused to acknowledge that there was a serious problem. We then went ahead and sued (we even had support from the code inspector and mold fumigator). I was the sole contact with the lawyer, taking and providing all of the evidence for the case. We didn't actually get an exact $ value yet because the case is still in progress but this was to be prepared for a win, and then I could scale it depending on the actual amount (the case was taken on where we wouldn't pay unless we won the case, so we are expecting to win). All 3 of us are named on the lawsuit as residents of the dwelling. I would like to hear unbiased opinions on if I'm the asshole for thinking Catherine doesn't really deserve more than $5k since she wasn't directly impacted and didn't help with providing any evidence for the case (and that still is pretty generous) Brianna's initial thought was that Catherine should get ‚Öô of the winnings which would equate to about $8k. Brianna and I are still together so we aren't fighting over it between us. (Brianna and I also have 2 cats  that stayed in our room when we slept throughout this time)

Catherine had a smaller leak a year before that needed repairs that spaned about 1 week. Catherine didn't provide that as extra evidence against the apartment complex for negligence when I brought up that I was going through with a lawsuit. What do you think is the fairest way to split lawsuit winning between the 3 of us? 

Edit: $50 k is the estimation post lawyer fees (provided by the lawyer of what they believe the case should win based on our evidence). I was also the sole point of contact with the Lawyer because I was the person willing to pay for the mold test in order to have statistical evidence of the elevated levels of black mold and other molds, the mold was clearly visible and growing on the walls but the complex would wipe it off each time they attempted to fix the leak and deny that it was a problem. The fumigation also came out of my pocket because the apartment complex denied the negligence and I was the one who could afford it the time, because we didn't want to carry the mold to a new place. That alone was ~$4k then adding in the mold testing and destroyed property due to the water damage bumped it up to at least $5k worth of expenses & property damage. I was also the only one that was truly willing to fight the apartment complex and go through with a lawsuit. Brianna didn't want to extend/add any more stress by going through with a lawsuit. Catherine didn't care either way because she basically kept to herself in her own room, that didn't really affect her living situation (using the living room) given that she stayed in her room almost all the time when she was home. Catherine wasn't directly affected in the way that she was living 90% of the same way as before Bri & I had to living out of the living room. I don't deal with stress well and I would've definitely preferred getting help from Brianna and Catherine. It caused a lot of friction between Brianna and I.

25,1djwrcd,AITA for not changing my parking place?,"Yesterday I got a text from my next door neighbor that some workers were using my parking place behind where I live as a staging area, but that they'd be done by noon. I thanked her for the headsup. Next text at 4PM was that they were still in my space but she'd have them move ASAP.

When I got home the ramp from the truck was blocking me from parking. I asked them to move it and they did, but my neighbor was pissed that I made them do that and told me the ramp would be coming down right away. I told her I needed to leave in two hours. She was still pissed for some reason and stormed away. The truck was gone by the time I left.

Today they were there again blocking my way to my parking place. I beeped my horn, they moved the ramp and I started to park.

Out came my neighbor furious with me that I was making them move the ramp. FYI - all that was involved was to lift it up, push it inside the truck, then pull it back out again after I parked.

To be honest, there is an empty parking place I suppose I could have used but A) I honestly didn't think of that because that's how my mind works; and B) I can't see my car from the back window if it was the other parking place and I would have needed to go back out after the workers left to move my car back.

FTR, we're in one of the 90+ degree areas and the last thing I'd want to do is go back outside to move my car.

Anyway, my neighbor started shouting about how rude I was and went on for a minute or so trying to tell me off about what a crappy neighbor I am (not remotely the words she used, btw).

I fussed a little at her, I admit, then I went inside my place because it's just way too hot to deal with this.

For some background, this is a neighbor that has never so much as invited me or made me feel as though I was welcome to sit on her porch, even when other neighbors were hanging around socializing. (Once when the  power was out in the neighborhood, I heard her outside on her porch, grabbed a bottle of wine, and asked if she wanted to share with me. She indicated - not in a rude way - that she wasn't interested, but not even a ""try me again another day.""

During the pandemic when she was aware that I lived alone and had no family to speak of, never so much as texted me to see if I was okay at any time. When she was dealing with heart problems, I did check in - both with her son and via text to see how she was doing multiple times. When I hadn't seen her in almost a month, I checked in to make sure she was okay.

And back to the present, she never once said to me, about the workers, ""Do you mind if they keep using your space to work in?"" instead of making it clear that I was rude for not automatically capitulating.

28,1djvlhs,AITA for asking 1k back to my sister when shes not that financially stable,"I (23M) have a bit of a dillemma involving my sister (27F) and some money I lent her. Over the past couple of years, I've lent her around 1,000 euros for various things like a vacation to Spain, a concert, and a few other expenses. We get along really well, but money in our family has always been tight and I think the both of us don‚Äôt really handle it the best.

My sister is currently working on her master's degree and also dealing with thyroid issues (thankfully its not dangerous but she is really tired) she works part time too so i get that this is a lot for her. We're both still living at home due to a housing crisis in our country, and I work part-time. Maybe it's because of my autism, but I find this whole situation hard to navigate, and I think I may be overly rigid or a jerk. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here for some outside opinions.

This year, I decided to go back to university, which comes with its own set of expenses. To focus on my studies, Im going to quit my job and now need to find my own place. Given the financial strain, I asked my sister to start repaying the money she owes me. I totally get that she can't pay it all back at once given her circumstances, and I'd be happy if she could manage even 50 euros a month. 

However, whenever I bring up the subject, she gets really defensive and insists she'll pay me back when she gets a full-time job, which might not happen for another 2 years. This winter, I went to Japan and covered all the expenses for both of us because I really wanted to go and thought it would be nice to bring her along. I have no problem having spent this because I had the expectation of gifting her something fun. Now, she‚Äôs planning another trip with a friend this summer. When I ask her about the money she owes me, she accuses me of being selfish and lacking empathy. I get that she wants to do fun things with her friends and she totally should, but if that‚Äôs possible I kind of want my money back. Especially now that I have increasing expenses I get anxious.

So, am I the asshole for asking my sister to start repaying the money she owes me, even if it's in small amounts?

Yesterday I went to the mall with my friends and bought some new clothes because the majority of my wardrobe didn‚Äôt fit me anymore. I bought a few tops, shoes, and three pairs of jeans. When I got home I put the clothes to wash and went to my room. After about an hour my sister walked into my room, visually upset, holding my jeans. I noticed she was carrying them and apologized to her because I assumed that they were done for a while so I was hogging the washing machine and perhaps she wanted to put her load of clothes to wash. When I went to grab them from her she stepped away not letting me take them. I asked her what‚Äôs wrong and she asked who‚Äôs jeans were these for. I told her they were for me and took them from her arms so that I can put them to dry. She replied by saying they‚Äôre way too small. I answered by saying that they fit me very well and I already tried them on at the store to make sure. She scoffed and said ‚Äúwell they won‚Äôt fit me‚Äù. I blinked and replied with ‚Äúsorry I guess you‚Äôll have to wear yours‚Äù. She seemed even more upset and told me about how she gained weight and can only fit into my size. I listened and shook my head replying that i‚Äôm not her size anymore. She left in a huff and i just watched. I‚Äôm a bit confused and i‚Äôm wondering if I had said something wrong?

36,1djttm9,AITA for not giving my sister a plus one to my wedding?,"Hi reddit, I (25F) am a Winter 2024 bride, and am marrying the absolute love of my life. My sister and I have always had a great/interesting relationship. Most sisters would know, one day you start fighting because she wore your clothes, and the next day you‚Äôre having Dunkin together, typically sisterly things. 

Well my sister has always been to put it frankly a pick me girl. She has no friends that are women because and she says ‚Äúshe sees them as competition‚Äù and she likes to be friends with boys. She will only date rich men, and refuses to settle for less (a little bit to that later). My sister has not had a relationship last longer than 2 months, and she always has a new guy on her shoulder. My mother and Fianc√© were recently talking about this before I sent out my invitations. I had mentioned since our venue was on smaller side, we didn‚Äôt want strangers in our wedding, nor did we want them in our wedding photos. My mom had made a comment about how anyone my sister would bring would be a fling, since she currently was not in a relationship.

 When we went home that night, I brought it up to my Fianc√© (we‚Äôll call him Bertram). I told Bertram that I really did not want a complete stranger in my wedding pictures, and certainly not someone my sister would only have been dating a few weeks, maybe a month. Well just this past week Bertram and I sent out our wedding invitations, and they read ‚ÄúWe have reserved __ seat(s) in your name.‚Äù So for example for my Fianc√©‚Äôs family his reads, ‚ÄúWe have reserved 4 seat(s) in your name.‚Äù When my sister received her invitation, hers read ‚ÄúWe have reserved 1 seat(s) in your name‚Äù. And boy was she upset. 

She called me and told me that it was not fair that she could not bring a plus one. I mentioned to her that she didn‚Äôt have the best track record with men, and that Bertram and I really didn‚Äôt want some random person nobody would talk about in our wedding pictures. She said that I was selfish, and that since our Wedding was towards the end of December (the 29th) she had 6 months to find a boyfriend, and that it would be a serious relationship. Now here I might‚Äôve gotten mean, but I told her I would seriously doubt if she found anyone, given her track record for the absolutely worse men alive. (As I mentioned before rich men, who think buying gifts will excuse cheating, and lying). 

She got upset, hung up, and said she will be attending my wedding with a boyfriend of 4 plus months because she will find one. AITA for not giving her a plus one?

37,1djtpix,AITA for agreeing to walk my nephew down the aisle?,"Me(48M) amd my nephew (23M) have always been really close. My sister has always been selfish and lays around waiting for everyone else to take her of her responsibilities so when she had my nephew she wasn't much different.  His dad is a user too and only ever came around all Zhe time to sniff up my sister's ass rather than spending time with his kid. Of course my nephew stuck to ms like glue and me and my grandma practically raised him doing all the actual work while my sister and his dad spent time with him occasionally when they weren't sleeping in the middle of the day or running off to smoke weed in their car.

As a result me and my nephew are close and I've done whatever I could for him even after having my own kids. I was even the first person he came out to. My sister resents this though and anytime I 
say opposite to her she snaps and I get constantly reminded im not his parent by family. He's getting married in a few weeks and last week he asked me to walk him down the aisle and I agreed. His mom found out Monday and was furious.. She calls me screaming at me that he's her son and he should've asked her or his dad. My wife thinks I should pay her no mind. But I've been getting calls from my mom and other family saying I shouldve told him no and steered him to his parents to avoid all the drama my sister is causing now. AITA?

A couple days ago, my cat got sick with symptoms I had never seen before. Given that vets here are always booked a few weeks out, I had to take him to the emergency vet.

42,1djt3u0,AITA for terminating my lease and abandoning my ex GF and her two teenage kids in a house we rented,"As the title states, I (M/37) terminated my lease at a house I was renting and fled to a spare room with a friend without any notice to my ex gf (F/42). Reaching this decision was not easy and I did not take it lightly. My family, friends, and therapist all support my decision; but I still feel guilty over what I did and would like the opinion of people outside of the situation.

Here's what happened leading up to the decision: 

My Ex, lets call her Jessica (fake name), was struggling financially while we were dating. She had been served a 'notice to quit' on more than one occasion at her previous apartment, and I helped her with anywhere between $500-$1500/month to help her pay her rent. She has two kids, both teenagers. Her previous apartment was walking distance from her kids school. She was 20 minutes away from her job. By this point we had been dating about 8 months and I could not afford to continue paying my full rent and also part or most of her rent. I offered to move her in with me, since I had two spare rooms, and I would cover utilities as long as she helped me with rent. We set the amount of $1100/month for rent, very generous when the rent median in the area we lived in (San Diego) was around $3000/month for a house with a yard and less than half of what she paid at her previous apartment. Once she moved in, she initially struggled to meet the agreed $1100/month. This was a source of tension in our relationship. She blamed me for moving her into the house and making her life more difficult. Her commute to work increased from 20 minutes to 25-45 minutes depending on traffic, and her kids now needed to take a tram or a bus to get to school. The stop for both was a 2 minute drive from where I lived, but it was an additional monthly cost of just under $60/month per student).  I was still covering all utilities, streaming services, internet, and buying groceries for her and her kids. After a few months, she began to gaslight me about how its my fault she moved and how she is unhappy living there. I was also the caretaker of my Mom since she is elderly and could not work. I had to send my mom across the country to my sister's because of the rising tension between her and Jessica. My mom went no contact on me because she believed I pushed her out the home to live with Jessica, for which my sister had to seek counseling with a therapist for her and my mom. Around this time Jessica begins to threaten calling in wellness checks on my mom if I bring her back home. A few months go by without any sort of help towards rent, and she begins to insult me as she walks by. My nephew was in the area and bought me a ticket to a museum and invited me to go after I was out from work. Jessica was still working so I told her I was going out with my nephew and I would return later. She accused me of avoiding introducing her to my family, she accused my nephew of planning this on purpose on her birthday weekend, and told me I should have asked him to reschedule for when she was available. My nephew was in town on vacation with his wife and had other plans, rescheduling was out of the question, and he had no clue about when her birthday was or her plans. This happened on a Friday and her birthday was the following Wednesday, but she intended to celebrate it on Sunday at home with friends. She threatened to leave the door open in the house and told me ""I hope your dog is trained"" knowing my dog tends to 'bolt' out the door if the door is left open. We have central AC and she insisted the reason for leaving the door open was because it was hot in the house. We broke up that day and I moved into my mom's room. That evening, upset with me, she began to barge in my room, turn on the lights, insult me, and barge out while I was trying to sleep. This persisted for hours until around midnight or 1am. The next day I did not want to remain in the house with her so I reached out to my nephew and asked to join him exploring San Diego. We went to a park and walked a lot. All the while my now Ex blew up my phone insisting I come back home and help her prepare for her birthday event the next day. I refused to return as I did not want to be near her after what she did the night before. I did not return until the evening and by that time she gave up on celebrating her birthday at home since the room she wanted to use was still full of her unpacked boxes from when she moved in. This was the first of many of what I consider psychological attacks on me. I do not do well with confrontation so when she confronts me when I do something she does not agree with, like going to the museum with my nephew, I tend to shut down and not talk at all. I seek help from a therapist a few weeks after this incident. 

A few other incidents of note: 

1. She barged into my room while I slept wielding a butter knife and yelling ""chinga tu madre"", startling me awake. When I was able to form cohesive words, I told her I did not like what she did and to not do it again. She responded with ""why? 'Cuz of your anxiety?"" and proceeded to do it again a few minutes later when I laid back down to sleep. A few days before this event, she asked me how my therapy was going and I had shared my therapist did not want to diagnose me just yet, but I displayed signs of high levels of anxiety.

2. She asked me to pay for her nicotine vapes and alcohol. I declined to pay for it. She accused me of 'trying to father' her and kept insisting I buy the items for her while sprinkling insults in between. 

3. She asked me to lend her money to buy gremlin figurines for her work desk because she was competing for some gift cards at work for best decorated desk. I refused to lend her the money as I was already financially stretched and was on the verge of having to choose between paying rent or paying my car note. I stepped outside while she continued to insist I lend her the money. When I continued to decline she went back into the house and locked the door behind her, locking me outside. I was lucky I had the house keys on me, but I normally don't when I step outside to throw trash out or retrieve something from my tool shed. Eventually she said she had to spend money she didn't have because the price went up on the figurines she wanted and she wouldn't be able to pay rent. She still hadn't paid any rent at this point. This was 5 months into her stay at the home. 

4. I had a hybrid job and a fully remote part-time job. While working on tasks for my part time job, she disabled the internet (unplugged router), barged into my room, sat on my bed, and insisted we talk about the living situation. Usually when we 'talk' she tells me what she wants me to do, and if I protest she insults me or tells me its my fault she is there and how I am ruining her and her kids lives. I refused to talk and I told her she was not welcome in my room and I would like her to leave and I am currently working and she is trying to force me to talk to her by disabling the internet. She refused to leave and continued to try and force me to talk to her for an hour before she finally gave up. I had to submit requests to correct my timesheet with HR for my part time job, which put me at risk of audits and other disciplinary actions.

5. Pretty frequently, she will do what I call ""flyby insults"" where she will tell me I am a piece of S\*\*\*, or I have a micro P\*\*\*\*, or I am stunted, or I'm like my father (a horrible person) using information I shared with her that I would not share with just anyone. These flyby insults usually occurred when she would go to the bathroom, either on her way in or on her way out. The room I stayed in has its own bathroom and it was closer to her room so she insisted in using it, even when I told her she was no longer welcome in the room. She would frequently use the fact I have a bathroom there that she wants to use as an excuse to justify her coming into my room. 

6. I felt sick, and was diagnosed with COVID. She eventually also contracted COVID. We were both out of work for 3 weeks. Even after COVID I continued to have respiratory problems for months. She accused me of giving her COVID on purpose, even though I tried my best to self isolate in my room. She accused me of using COVID to get her sick and have her miss work so she would be behind on bills. Sick leave was in effect in San Diego at the time, employers are obligated to pay hours for employees who are sick with COVID. She used this sick time as an excuse to not contribute to rent. This was roughly 6 months into her stay and she had yet to help with any rent to this point. 

7. Jessica signed up to spend a weekend prospecting higher education campuses. She needed her car oil changed. She also needed to take the kids to their dad's for the weekend. She waited until the very last minute to ask me to help her change the oil in her car. By this time I was trying to spend the least amount of time around her, and was refusing to pay for any of her or her kid's expenses as we had been broken up for months already and I did not agree with how she was treating me. She kept insisting I help her change her car's oil and                   accused me of trying to make her lose her kids. I eventually agreed to drop off her kids for her in my car so she could take her car in for an oil change. She also asked me to pick them up on Sunday, since she wouldn't be returning until later that night. Sunday afternoon I called her to ask her when she wanted me to pick up her kids, and she told me 'never mind'. I later found out she picked them up and took them to Disneyland. This is all fine, but this was about 8 months into her stay and she had yet to help with any of the bills and was always telling me it was my fault she never had money and my fault she is struggling. She did not tell me of her trip to Disney with the kids. They let it slip and tried to deny it after, leading me to believe she told them to keep it a secret.

At one point I hung out with a friend and vented about what I was going through, and he offered me a room. I paid 2 months worth of rent to my landlord, roughly shared the situation with him, and told him I am leaving . This occurred the first week of the month, and rent was paid for that month and the next. I took as much of my things and left. 

While I did not give her notice I was leaving, I did pay for two months rent and asked the landlord to inform her the lease was terminated and she had just under 60 days to vacate. By this time she had stayed about 10 months in the house and had not paid a single cent for her and her kids stay. 

I don't know the impact something like this will have on her kids. They are teenagers and do not deserve this at all, and leaving them is what I regret most of this situation. I never insulted her. I never made fun of her body. I never forced a conversation on her. I never asked her for favors. I never kept her up while she tried to sleep. I never denied her help when she was sick or not feeling well. She did all these things to me and more, while living rent free and not paying for utilities or amenities for almost a year. She also took all my furniture when she eventually left the house (allegedly, I cannot prove because she turned off all the ring cameras in the house. But there is no signs of forced entry to the house). I will admit I was not the best at communicating or setting boundaries and I worked and am still working with my therapist to improve that. My family, friends, and therapist all side with me on this, but I cannot help but feel guilt for just fleeing the way I did.

So, Reddit. AITA for fleeing from my house and leaving my ex and her two kids behind?   
",TL;DR,2024-06-19,"AITA for terminating my lease and abandoning my ex GF and her two teenage kids in a house we rented As the title states, I (M/37) terminated my lease at a house I was renting and fled to a spare room with a friend without any notice to my ex gf (F/42). Reaching this decision was not easy and I did not take it lightly. My family, friends, and therapist all support my decision; but I still feel guilty over what I did and would like the opinion of people outside of the situation.

Here's what happened leading up to the decision: 

My Ex, lets call her Jessica (fake name), was struggling financially while we were dating. She had been served a 'notice to quit' on more than one occasion at her previous apartment, and I helped her with anywhere between $500-$1500/month to help her pay her rent. She has two kids, both teenagers. Her previous apartment was walking distance from her kids school. She was 20 minutes away from her job. By this point we had been dating about 8 months and I could not afford to continue paying my full rent and also part or most of her rent. I offered to move her in with me, since I had two spare rooms, and I would cover utilities as long as she helped me with rent. We set the amount of $1100/month for rent, very generous when the rent median in the area we lived in (San Diego) was around $3000/month for a house with a yard and less than half of what she paid at her previous apartment. Once she moved in, she initially struggled to meet the agreed $1100/month. This was a source of tension in our relationship. She blamed me for moving her into the house and making her life more difficult. Her commute to work increased from 20 minutes to 25-45 minutes depending on traffic, and her kids now needed to take a tram or a bus to get to school. The stop for both was a 2 minute drive from where I lived, but it was an additional monthly cost of just under $60/month per student).  I was still covering all utilities, streaming services, internet, and buying groceries for her and her kids. After a few months, she began to gaslight me about how its my fault she moved and how she is unhappy living there. I was also the caretaker of my Mom since she is elderly and could not work. I had to send my mom across the country to my sister's because of the rising tension between her and Jessica. My mom went no contact on me because she believed I pushed her out the home to live with Jessica, for which my sister had to seek counseling with a therapist for her and my mom. Around this time Jessica begins to threaten calling in wellness checks on my mom if I bring her back home. A few months go by without any sort of help towards rent, and she begins to insult me as she walks by. My nephew was in the area and bought me a ticket to a museum and invited me to go after I was out from work. Jessica was still working so I told her I was going out with my nephew and I would return later. She accused me of avoiding introducing her to my family, she accused my nephew of planning this on purpose on her birthday weekend, and told me I should have asked him to reschedule for when she was available. My nephew was in town on vacation with his wife and had other plans, rescheduling was out of the question, and he had no clue about when her birthday was or her plans. This happened on a Friday and her birthday was the following Wednesday, but she intended to celebrate it on Sunday at home with friends. She threatened to leave the door open in the house and told me ""I hope your dog is trained"" knowing my dog tends to 'bolt' out the door if the door is left open. We have central AC and she insisted the reason for leaving the door open was because it was hot in the house. We broke up that day and I moved into my mom's room. That evening, upset with me, she began to barge in my room, turn on the lights, insult me, and barge out while I was trying to sleep. This persisted for hours until around midnight or 1am. The next day I did not want to remain in the house with her so I reached out to my nephew and asked to join him exploring San Diego. We went to a park and walked a lot. All the while my now Ex blew up my phone insisting I come back home and help her prepare for her birthday event the next day. I refused to return as I did not want to be near her after what she did the night before. I did not return until the evening and by that time she gave up on celebrating her birthday at home since the room she wanted to use was still full of her unpacked boxes from when she moved in. This was the first of many of what I consider psychological attacks on me. I do not do well with confrontation so when she confronts me when I do something she does not agree with, like going to the museum with my nephew, I tend to shut down and not talk at all. I seek help from a therapist a few weeks after this incident. 

A few other incidents of note: 

1. She barged into my room while I slept wielding a butter knife and yelling ""chinga tu madre"", startling me awake. When I was able to form cohesive words, I told her I did not like what she did and to not do it again. She responded with ""why? 'Cuz of your anxiety?"" and proceeded to do it again a few minutes later when I laid back down to sleep. A few days before this event, she asked me how my therapy was going and I had shared my therapist did not want to diagnose me just yet, but I displayed signs of high levels of anxiety.

2. She asked me to pay for her nicotine vapes and alcohol. I declined to pay for it. She accused me of 'trying to father' her and kept insisting I buy the items for her while sprinkling insults in between. 

3. She asked me to lend her money to buy gremlin figurines for her work desk because she was competing for some gift cards at work for best decorated desk. I refused to lend her the money as I was already financially stretched and was on the verge of having to choose between paying rent or paying my car note. I stepped outside while she continued to insist I lend her the money. When I continued to decline she went back into the house and locked the door behind her, locking me outside. I was lucky I had the house keys on me, but I normally don't when I step outside to throw trash out or retrieve something from my tool shed. Eventually she said she had to spend money she didn't have because the price went up on the figurines she wanted and she wouldn't be able to pay rent. She still hadn't paid any rent at this point.

43,1djt31f,AITA for punishing my picky niece after she stole my jams?,"My (36F) brother (32M) was recently jailed for a non-violent offense, and I took in his daughter, my niece Jolie (10t). Jolie has always been an extremely picky eater, refusing to eat anything but junk food. I understand she‚Äôs grown up mainly on TV dinners and fast food, but I have always been a firm believer in healthy eating and balanced meals. I do not keep junk in my home because I don‚Äôt want my kids to be encouraged to eat that stuff.

In our house, we follow a strict mostly raw food diet due to my son‚Äôs digestive issues. I told Jolie that she had to eat what I made or she wouldn‚Äôt get anything else. My two sons (10M and 8M) have always been good about this and helped me prepare meals, including the jams and sauces we were making for an upcoming Country Fair to raise funds for our local community center.

Last week, my sons and I spent hours picking fresh berries, carefully preparing, and canning my jams and sauces. They were all set on the kitchen counter, ready to go.

Two nights ago, I noticed several jars were missing. After searching the house, I found them empty and stashed in Jolie‚Äôs room. She had clearly been sneaking in and eating the jams and sauces straight from the jars. I was furious. These were meant to help raise money for a good cause, and now my hard work and my sons' efforts were ruined.

I confronted Jolie about it, and she admitted to taking them. She cried and said she stole the jams because she was hungry and couldn‚Äôt stand the ‚Äúplain meals‚Äù I made. In a fit of anger, I decided to punish her. I told her she is to stay in her room from now on and can eat alone until her punishment is over.

When I told my brother about the incident over the phone, he was pissed. He called me a ‚Äúyuppie‚Äù and told me giving Jolie a ‚Äúfat burger‚Äù hasn‚Äôt killed anyone.

Our half-sister also called me, saying I was too harsh and that I should be more compassionate given Jolie‚Äôs situation. But from my perspective, stealing is wrong, and Jolie needs to learn she can‚Äôt do that to her aunt. Besides, I can‚Äôt tolerate her unhealthy eating habits disrupting my life and efforts, especially when my sons had worked so hard on the bake sale preparations.

My two other sisters and parents are on my side, but my brother and half-sister fervently disagree.

44,1djt0d4,AITA for locking my room and telling my sister she has to pay me to use my things?,"For context I (18F) have a younger sister (15F) who likes using my stuff a lot. Be it makeup, clothes, or other things I‚Äôve bought. I don‚Äôt have an issue with her borrowing or using my things, but my issue is that she is almost NEVER careful and always finds a way to break or ruin my things. 

Some of the more memorable incidents we‚Äôve had include:

1) When she used my gaming pc to play with her friends while I was out and spilled water all over my keyboard, essentially ruining it and costing me money to buy a new one. 

2) Borrowing my motorcycle helmet for go-karting with the guy she likes because she didn‚Äôt want to use the public ones, and returning it to me with the visor all scratched up. 

3) Returning clothes to me either with stains or stretched out. (For example, I lent her white sweatpants once and she gave them back to me with coffee stains going down the left leg.)

I‚Äôve talked to her many times about taking care of other people‚Äôs stuff, but it seems to do nothing. 

Anyways, it all came to a head last week, when I came back from a hangout with my friends and went to my bathroom to wash my face. I saw the makeup I used earlier all over the place (the floor included). 

They weren‚Äôt on the shelf the way I left them, and some bottles were even left open and on their side. My brushes were dirty, she basically dug a hole in one of the shades of my eyeshadow palettes, and she somehow managed to tear the spongy part of my foundation applicator. She also managed to finish my $45 concealer, which wasn‚Äôt exactly new, but wasn‚Äôt at the end either. 

After rearranging everything, I went to my sisters room and scolded her for first of all using my makeup without permission, and second of all destroying some of it. My parents heard the commotion and came to check on us. My dad said it‚Äôs just makeup and I can buy more, to which I started listing the prices of my makeup. His answer was just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt buy expensive makeup‚Äù, while my mom agreed with my anger and took me shopping to replace everything. 

Since then, I‚Äôve started locking my bedroom door every time I‚Äôm not there, and keeping the key with me. Every time my sister texts me asking for the key, I respond with nothing but the photos I took of my destroyed makeup. She complained to our dad, who scolded me for acting like a child. I told them both if she wants to use my stuff instead of getting her own, then she can start paying me until I‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt break everything she touches.  

My friends say I‚Äôm justified, but the story reached my extended family, and I have aunts and uncles texting me saying family is supposed to share, especially since she doesn‚Äôt have a job like me, and I overreacted. So, AITA?

Edit to update: my mom suggested we go into my sisters room to make sure she didn‚Äôt take anything else and we found a lot of stuff I thought I misplaced; a perfume bottle and a deodorant bottle from the ones I can only find when I visit my birth country, hairties I thought I misplaced (they‚Äôre purple and very easy to recognize), a few tops, and she even took some of my F1 caps even though she doesn‚Äôt watch it (???).

45,1djszuw,AITA for asking my gma to tell my mom that she invited my mom‚Äôs ex-husband to her bday party?,"so some backstory. my parents were married for 26 years, got divorced in 2016, both are happily remarried. they grew up in a small town where both of their families still live. however since remarrying my mom has moved 3 hours away with her new husband. she still goes back to her hometown a lot because as mentioned, her mom and siblings all still live there so we have a lot of family gatherings there. well my maternal gmas 80th bday is coming up and she wants a bigggg party with our whole family and all her friends, most of the town essentially.  well, my gma decided to text and invite my dad/moms ex husband, and his new wife, to her bday party. she did not ask my mom if this was okay, or tell her that she invited him. i only found out that she texted to invite him because he told my sister.

i find this very weird. it puts me, my 2 sisters, my mom, and her new husband all in an awkward situation. 

idk if my dad will end up going or not. i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he does bc he can‚Äôt read social cues and doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a weird space for him to be in since he knows a lot of the ppl going but im like? it‚Äôs weird. 

so today i texted my gma and asked if she had asked my mom / told her she was going to invite him. text thread below:

me- hey gma! my dad said you texted him and invited him and [dads wife] to your bday party. i was just wondering if you‚Äôd mentioned this to my mom / ran it by her? i appreciate you being kind to him but i feel like it puts mom and [moms husband] in a weird situation, and me and my sisters as well.

gma- I don‚Äôt know how to respond to this as I reached out as a friend on my own  and didn‚Äôt realize that there was any feeling of weirdness awkwardness in doing this. It did not cross my mind to ask your mom as I was thinking of friends that were a part of my 80 years and I guess what is done is done‚Ä¶

me- okay! i‚Äôm just sure she‚Äôs not expecting him to be there so would you give her a heads up so she‚Äôs aware he was invited?

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-19,"AITA for asking my gma to tell my mom that she invited my mom‚Äôs ex-husband to her bday party? so some backstory. my parents were married for 26 years, got divorced in 2016, both are happily remarried. they grew up in a small town where both of their families still live. however since remarrying my mom has moved 3 hours away with her new husband. she still goes back to her hometown a lot because as mentioned, her mom and siblings all still live there so we have a lot of family gatherings there. well my maternal gmas 80th bday is coming up and she wants a bigggg party with our whole family and all her friends, most of the town essentially.  well, my gma decided to text and invite my dad/moms ex husband, and his new wife, to her bday party. she did not ask my mom if this was okay, or tell her that she invited him. i only found out that she texted to invite him because he told my sister.

i find this very weird. it puts me, my 2 sisters, my mom, and her new husband all in an awkward situation. 

idk if my dad will end up going or not. i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he does bc he can‚Äôt read social cues and doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a weird space for him to be in since he knows a lot of the ppl going but im like? it‚Äôs weird. 

so today i texted my gma and asked if she had asked my mom / told her she was going to invite him. text thread below:

me- hey gma! my dad said you texted him and invited him and [dads wife] to your bday party. i was just wondering if you‚Äôd mentioned this to my mom / ran it by her? i appreciate you being kind to him but i feel like it puts mom and [moms husband] in a weird situation, and me and my sisters as well.

gma- I don‚Äôt know how to respond to this as I reached out as a friend on my own  and didn‚Äôt realize that there was any feeling of weirdness awkwardness in doing this. It did not cross my mind to ask your mom as I was thinking of friends that were a part of my 80 years and I guess what is done is done‚Ä¶

me- okay! i‚Äôm just sure she‚Äôs not expecting him to be there so would you give her a heads up so she‚Äôs aware he was invited?

gma- sure‚Ä¶

she clearly is not happy with me even asking her if she brought it up to my mom prior to inviting him. am i the asshole for calling my gma out for being sneaky? should i just not have mentioned it at all? should i have just told my mom that she invited him?

My husband and I thought this was way too soon but remained respectful and civil to her, she met my daughter once and held her because she asked and all was fine. 

Since then she has messaged me on facebook trying to insist I have to have girls days with her and get pedicures like I used to do with MIL. I was very kind in explaining that I did not feel ready and didn‚Äôt know if I ever would anytime soon. She kept insisting and friending me over and over and I hardly knew her, so I stopped responding. 

It became obvious very early that she has an alcohol addiction, and my husband looked her up online out of curiosity and found a record of driving while drunk. Well we told his dad about it and maybe that‚Äôs where we F‚Äôd up.

AITA for not letting my FILs girlfriend around my kid? 

I 23F have been married to my husband 21M for 3 years and we have a 9m old. 

Last may I was 5 months pregnant when my MIL died. It was hard on everyone and devastating and totally random. Less than 2 months later my FIL moved a new girlfriend into his house. My husband and I thought this was way too soon but remained respectful and civil to her, she met my daughter once and held her because she asked and all was fine. 

Since then she has messaged me on facebook trying to insist I have to have girls days with her and get pedicures like I used to do with MIL. I was very kind in explaining that I did not feel ready and didn‚Äôt know if I ever would anytime soon. She kept insisting and friending me over and over and I hardly knew her, so I stopped responding. 

It became obvious very early that she has an alcohol addiction, and my husband looked her up online out of curiosity and found a record of driving while drunk. Well we told his dad about it and maybe that‚Äôs where we F‚Äôd up.

I texted her individually and explained that while I did have the funds originally, I‚Äôd reallocated them after she had cancelled the plan. The final plan was to sleepover at the Bride‚Äôs and then do a drag brunch in the city.¬†

Weekend of: I show up a few hours early to the bride‚Äôs house. I walk in and find laundry, dirty dishes, guest beds completely unmade, and puddles of dog pee everywhere, but also boxes stacked all over the house. Unpacked. This hurt my feelings because she was supposed to be there to support me at my engagement celebration until she cancelled two days before saying she couldn‚Äôt leave her fiance to set the house up alone. I cleaned her house, did the laundry, and made up the beds we were supposed to sleep in that night. The bride drove us in my car and said she‚Äôd pay for gas since I had just driven 4 and a half hours to be there already. We got to the drag brunch location and realized it was a rooftop bar at noon in the middle of the summer. My ginger fiancee also joined us. So I spent the next 4 hours standing up using a giant fan to fan the bride and the rest of the group and shade them from the sun as much as possible. I also covered lunch.

In front of her new boyfriend, Ashley asked us ‚Äúwhy we hadn't told her we were going in together on the watch and she said she would have loved to chip in.‚Äù James was mad and tells her loudly, ‚ÄúYou should have bought Dad a new watch by now since you stole the last one.‚Äù 

Ashley turned to me upset and said she couldn't afford it right now, and she would pay us for 1/3 of the watch in payment so it could be from all of us. I told her, ‚Äú I can't be from all of us. We already gave it to Dad, but you can get him one by yourself and replace the one you stole.‚Äù 

Ashley start crying and they left after that. My mom seemed angry because she wants us to all to forgive Ashley and we should have gave her a heads up about getting dad a watch because she would have never asked Ashley to come if that's what we got him to avoid the ‚Äúawkwardness‚Äù ",2.0,0.047610145062208176,0,0
63,1djodnn,WIBTA if I put a fence up to my property line?,"My husband and I bought a new build house in the summer last year (almost a year ago). At the time, we didn't know that someone had purchased 5 houses on our street. Every other house in on our street belongs to this person, and he rents them out. It's taken him a long time to get actual renters in the properties, so we didn't really think much of it until this summer. 

On our corner, our lot is the largest and it looks kind of like a pie wedge with our driveway out front being the tip and the broader piece in the back bumping up to a hill and city utility easement. Our neighbors to the right of us moved in about four months ago. They have a dog that they keep chained in the yard, and it breaks loose all the time. We installed cameras in the back because I have a reactive dog and a few times we've been taking him out back (on a leash) and the dog has come running up and there have almost been a few incidents. We've talked to the owner about it, but nothing has really changed. Now their kids are playing in our yard all the time because the neighbors that moved in to the left of us also have kids. They ride their mini four-wheelers through the yard and have damaged the lawn sprinkler system. We talked to their parents and they said they would try to keep their kids out of our yard but kids will be kids. They don't really listen, and I don't really feel like it's my place to go out there and tell them they need to get off our lawn (man, I feel really old writing that). 

I asked a few fencing companies out to take a look at how much it would cost us to put a fence up. Because of our property line, our fence would look like it was almost partially in their back yards. This has already been somewhat of an issue because the hill behind our development washed out and covered the lawns in mud and my husband has gone out to rake the mud once it dried, and the renters have complained about him being in ""their"" yard. The houses on either side of us have the smallest lots in our development. This would reduce the amount of yard space the kids have, which makes me feel kind of bad. But I don't want to not have our fence to the property line and the landlord later put fencing up to ours and essentially ""claim"" those portions of our property in doing so. It seems kind of like a headache. 

When I talked to a couple of friends about this, they mentioned that we might be TA if we do this. I also don't want to become one of those ""HOA people"" who throws the book down anytime a conversation comes up with neighbors. I'd much rather get along with them than have any problems with anyone, but I'm also worried about my dogs and tired of replacing these stupid sprinkler heads at my own cost. So, WIBTA?

Up until a few months ago I was working full time and staying at my sisters house on nights where I worked late or had to get up super early for work. I had a running vehicle, and would give her rides when my schedule allowed. Flash forward I end up getting pregnant, and spent more time at her house as my home was undergoing renovations. I end up losing my job over a simple mistake, and so ended up being her baby sitter while she worked more hours. I would drive back and forth between her house and my home every day, never asking for money and never having a problem with it. 

In May, she wanted to take her son to the water park 3 hours away for his birthday and wanted to use my car, which I had no problems with. It started having issues before the trip, which ended up being fixed, and we did routine maintenance before the trip. On the way there, the car started having serious issues and we made it to the destination, but were not able to make it home. I had to leave my car in an unfamiliar city and we got home. Unfortunately, my insurance lapsed so I had to pay out of pocket for everything. The next day, my bf and I rented a Uhaul and towed my car back home, where it‚Äôs currently sitting now. This cost us a good chunk of money out of pocket that we didn‚Äôt have to spare with the baby on the way and also trying to make sure we had a child safe home.

 But I (24f) was with O(26f) for almost 2 years. Met at our job, and started dating about two months after her last relationship. 

We broke up last year for many reasons, most importantly it was just toxic. In the time we were apart I was doing so much better, and working on my end of things. Only find out she had gotten into another relationship with A(21f) who also worked with us and did so for a few months after that. I was devastated . I drank, smoked and cried everyday because this was the person I wanted to marry and was also my first love.

she tried to justify it and defend it, telling me that she was sorry and to please wait for her. One excused she used was that the other girl has a much sadder life than me, that her life is much harder and that she has much less family than I do. Call me heartless but I said that I don't care and what does have to do with me? She's not my friend, I don't know her and I don't care too. (She used her against me) I told her that much and if we were to get back together in the future then I don't want her apart of our lives no matter how the relationship changed to friendship. 

And she had gotten tired of me  always bringing A up and agree to never bring her up again. I had thought that they finally stopped talking in March and was trying to get over it and move in but still struggling to. she would always tell me that she still loved me and was trying to find her way back to me

But yesterday I had checked on my other accounts her profile and seen that they are still following eachother. I lost it. I was so mad, telling her how she could do this to me and how could she think I would be okay with this.

I felt like I was going crazy this whole time, thinking I'm the bad person for feeling like I do. Telling her Im scared I wouldn't be able to get over this and that if that's what she wanted then fine I won't beg, just please leave me alone and let me go. You can't have both. I blocked her on everything because I was truly done, I couldn't take it anymore. she came towards the end of work and tried again defending why they were still talking.

70,1djn7ug,WIBTA for changing my flight and leaving a trip early?,"Throwaway account.

My partner Dan (28M) and I (28F) have a mutual best friend, Shelby (29F) that has an important event coming up this summer in Colorado that we‚Äôre flying to from home in Seattle in order to support her and we‚Äôre all staying in an Airbnb together. We are only going to this event in support of Shelby and have no connection to it otherwise. 

We are staying with her a few days before it (by her request) so she‚Äôs not out there alone and we happily obliged as Dan and I work from home and can work anywhere in the road. The trip is from Tuesday, her event is Friday and the plan was to stay with her until late evening Saturday in order to have time to celebrate before we head back home.  This has been planned for about 2 months now with the event being about 4 weeks away. We also spent our own money to be there. (Not a huge deal at all -but maybe this context is important for everyone?) 

This morning I get a message asking if we can just have breakfast on Saturday and then ‚Äúsplit ways‚Äù so she can go explore by herself. While I‚Äôm not upset, I find it a bit odd (and maybe selfish/inconsiderate?) that she wanted us to come and then changes plans last minute. This kind of hurt our feelings as we were making plans all together for Saturday morning/afternoon before we have to take off on our flight. 


My question is, would my partner and I be the asshole if we just switched to an earlier flight Saturday morning instead of the evening?

 This flight would most likely be too early to go have breakfast with her after looking at our options for flights online. Obviously I‚Äôm going to talk to her about this but I‚Äôm wondering if it would be rude or petty to bring this up as a potential option for us since the only reason we‚Äôre going on this trip is for her anyway. Plus, Dan and I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting home earlier in the morning versus late evening as originally planned.

I (15f) am in a weird situation and would like an outside perspective. I am my parents, mom (37f) and dad (42m) only child together, and I have a stepmom ‚ÄúEve‚Äù (42f). From what I was told, my dad and my step mom were a couple first but things didn't work out shortly after they had my siblings, and my dad eventually met and married my mom after she discovered that she was pregnant with me. My dad didn't marry Eve and from what my aunts told me she was really bitter about that and used my siblings as a weapon to punish my dad and mom.

My mom tried her best but after she found out that my dad and Eve were sleeping together she filed for divorce. During the marriage my dad had an established business that grew and because my mom was able to prove that she had done unpaid labor for my dad's business my mom had some leverage within the divorce and agreed to relinquish a stake in the company for alimony, the house, and a car for herself while getting child support for me. For the next couple of years my mom focused on me and going back to school because my dad convinced her to stop while she was taking a break from her studies to save up more money.

She eventually graduated and tried looking for work but nothing really interested her. My dad and step mom (who had gotten married by then) were always angry with my mom for not getting a job so that they would be less alimony to pay and tried to get 50/50 custody of me to try and reduce child support but I never liked living with my dad full time because I was often made to babysit their younger children, my older siblings were never warmed up to me, and I didn't like they way Eve and her family would talk about my mom.

Eventually, my mom got certified for a job she wanted and has been an independent contractor for years. Because of this my mom submitted the paperwork to stop alimony and she's been living life. Last week when I was with my mom Eve, my sister ""Zoe"" (20f), and Eve's sisters were in the living room saying very rude things about my mom. They called her a side piece, a gold digger, and said that my older sister had to take out loans because of the increase in alimony that my mom was awarded. I walked in and called Eve and Zoe liars, that my mom was never the side piece, and my mom has been working for years so there was no alimony.

There was a big confrontation and I ended up leaving but I later sent Eve, Zoe, and one of Eve's sisters a link to my mom's professional social media page that listed the companies she worked for. Turns out my dad never told his family that the alimony payments stopped and instead of putting the extra money towards them he's been keeping it for spending it elsewhere. It‚Äôs crazy over there and my dad and a few of his family members are saying that I'm wrong for meddling in ""grown folks business."" I just hated how they were talking and spreading lies about my mom but maybe I went about it the wrong way so AITA?

One of them, O (26) has struggled with rent and bills and I helped her out multiple times. In April, she fell for a scam and borrowed $700 from me, lost that, and then lost her job and couldn't pay for rent-$850, so I covered that too. 

My cat has a bad tooth and needs surgery so I texted her asking her to pay me back the rest by the end of the week ($750, she already paid the rent $ back), a deadline O herself set after pushing it back multiple times. She said she couldn't talk about the $ she owes me because she's going through a lot and this conversation negatively impacted her mental health so she's setting a boundary and will only speak on the $ if needed.

I kept pushing though and said I was the person who would determine if it was needed, not her. She accused me of not respecting her boundaries or mental health and threatened to block me, to which I responded by saying I'd talk to her about the $ whether she blocked me or not, pay me back by the deadline she herself set, and to borrow it if need be.

AITA for insisting on this conversation even after O set a boundary? 99% of the time I would never push a topic that harms someone's mental health, and I also feel bad causing drama in the house and putting our 3rd roommate in the position of go between since O now refuses to speak to me. 

I also lost my dad recently and had a spiral because of father's day, so this weekend I got into several conflicts where I was DEFINTELY in the wrong and have been on an apology tour (thankfully my friends are very understanding), so I feel unsure of whether this was another one of those situations in which I lost my shit even though I'm usually very even keel and drama free?

This day when we are about to go somewhere, her mother noticed something is off with my bff's abdomen? Stomach? I don't know what that part is called, forgive me. That's when I started telling her mother what was really happening. She told me she would get scolded again, and that she doesn't want to hear any of that again. 

I feel guilty, but this is the only way she would get checked. I think she's somehow mad at me because she said ""you betrayed me  :("" with confusing tone like is she joking or not. I said to her, ""It's for your own good"" and hug her.
I even said while crying that she can choose to break our friendship (FO) if she cannot forgive the betrayal (which I do not invalidate) I did, as long as she get checked. 

Her mother already said she'll get checked I think asap.

I could only feel pain now, and I am still crying but I care more about her health and life.

So AITH for telling her situation to her mother?
If not, in which part did I became an asshole? Please be kind as much as possible in your responses. Thank you.",0.0,1.0575824975967407,1,0

The thing is, we are both really overworked. That means we can't just go wherever we want whenever we want, so we have to allign our free time and carefully plan it.

Last year, one of my bf's relatives meantioned that his family will be going on a trip this year(not gonna say where but it would be expensive for both of us to go along).
I really didn't heard more of it until my bf said he was reacently invinted to the trip AND wouldn't have to spend a single dollar on it. I think that everyone will pay a little bit for him, but I don't know.

I wasn't invited and he won't be able to go anywhere with me this year because of this. (His words)

This week he asked me if I could buy some things for him (like winter clonthes, a new backpack and some other things) because he is short in time and his flight is next week. 

The thing is, I'm also short in time. Always am. Sometimes I do buy things that he needs out of love and just wanting to help him, but is always a rush. So, I know that he expect me to accept it and help him, but I'm feeling kinda used and don't really want to.

I know that the trip is an oppourtunity for him , but I feel ""robbed"" of our potential vacation for this year.

WIBTA if I don't help him this time?

Ps: ""wifes"" and ""husbands"" were invited, but they are paying and I am broke üòé

A year and a few months ago, my brother showed significant improvement in his academics, he went from C's to B's and two A's. Then i started to save money for the trip and informed my wife who was pessimistic about the idea and didn't think i would actually save for it

Three months ago, I planned to visit my mother‚Äôs house to remind her about preparing documents for the trip, but my wife seduced me(best sex ever) and tried to convince me to cancel the trip and use the  money for another trip together probably Disneyland.

A week ago , my wife accused me of favoring my brother over her and being a mama's boy. She started ignoring me, and eventually went to stay at her sister

I love his family and we get along well.

My partner said his sister wanted to visit with her 8 month old baby and stay with us because that is how his family operates. Honestly that in itself made me nervous‚Äî my apartment is small and gets very hot (85 degrees inside isn‚Äôt abnormal even with AC) and is not baby proofed, plus she‚Äôd have to travel with a crib or playpen and squeeze it somewhere around our blow up mattress (which also has a small leak).

I said this as a matter of fact and to continue the conversation. No animosity or condescending tone. Then I was surprised when he suddenly replied

My sister also has a perfectly fine desk in her room where it is quiet, but still chooses to study where the most noise is. I called her egoistic, because I don‚Äôt think she can expect us all to be quiet, because she chose the busiest place in the house to study. I offered her my noise cancelling headphones, but she didn‚Äôt want them. This is also the second day I can‚Äôt watch TV, yesterday we had the same argument, but I have in to her and left.

She told me I am the egoistic one, but I don‚Äôt think I am, because I don‚Äôt ask her to be quiet when I study and I have her several compromises, but she doesn‚Äôt want to budge‚Ä¶ please help

88,1djfx9t,AITA for inviting both my divorced parents to Disney World?,"I'm 38, my husband is 36 and my daughter is 4. My parents have been divorced since I was 12. I am an only child. I often host holiday dinners at my home and they both tend to come and be civil to each other. My dad loves to talk about the past, my mom is probably the only one who has the same memories as him. I don't think they like each other, but they don't hate each other.

Both my parents are retired, I live a 5 hour plane ride from WDW and my parents are about a 2 hour ride - they both live in the same state where I grew up. 

I thought about it and I can't afford to go to Disney twice in a short period of time. I could maybe do it in a few years, but not any faster than that. They both would love to be there for our daughter's first visit since we went to Disney a lot when I was growing up (both with them together and separately after they divorced).

So I offered them to come with us, everything but flights paid for by me. BUT it'd have to be both of them. I refuse to choose one and since I am paying they can either come now or join us in a few years. They will each get their own bedroom, but they would need to be around each other for meals unless they preferred to eat alone. 

Since I am paying, I feel like this is fair. My mom agrees and she has said she would be fine with it. My parents are very different so in reality by mom would be taking my daughter back to the hotel a lot anyway for naps or sitting with her in the shade while we go on the rides my daughter can't go on. My dad would prefer to be on the rides with us and going nonstop. I do think they won't have to deal with each other most. Neither of them are married or in relationships, so no jealous partners.

My dad, however, is not thrilled and I do think he will go, but is already being passive aggressive about it. 

I told my sister in law about our plans and she told me that it was unfair for me to expect my divorced parents to vacation together and we should do two separate trips. I said either of them are welcome to turn down my invitation and not come, which my SIL seemed to think is just an asshole move.

89,1djfokl,AITAH for leaving my best friend at the bar after she grabbed my plate and refused to give it back until I apologised?,"My friend (24F) and I (24F) have been friends for over four years. We'll call her Mia. This incident happened towards the end of February this year. 

Mia and I had decided to meet up for drinks and tapas, to catch up, after we hadn't seen each other since the beginning of January. Everything was going well on the girls day out until Mia started getting tipsy. 

I had shown her a picture of the Valentine's day setup my boyfriend had done for me two weeks prior. I don't really post on socials anymore so this was her first time seeing it. Her whole aura completely changed. The conversation started getting confrontational and Mia asked why had I not been checking up on her, and how I had been putting our friendship on the back burner. She accused me of not being able to balance a boyfriend and my friendships.  

To add more context, when I had seen Mia in January it was during her stay at a mental health centre. She had mentioned needing a breather, so I picked her up from the facilities and we spent a day by the beach.  After this day our WhatsApp conversations were sparse with me checking if she's still alright and vice verse. 

Early February I had a familial issue I was dealing with and completely went quiet on all my acquaintances and friends. This was excluding my boyfriend who I basically live with at this point. I'm guessing she saw the Valentine's day pictures and thought clearly you were present enough to celebrate that. 

Back to the girls day out; her mood is now completely flipped. She grabs the plate of food I'm eating from and says ""you're not getting this until you explain why you abandoned me"". Mind you the people around us at the bar are looking at us now. I tell her this is very immature, send her my portion of the bill and leave. 

She calls me multiple times after I leave and texts asking ""what's up?"".  She eventually sends a text, a couple of days later, apologising for her behaviour. 

I guess my mistake was responding to the text four days later accepting the apology, because we have not spoken since.

90,1djf78o,AITA for not revealing that my brother was cheating on his wife?,"I want to preface this by saying that I do not condone cheating. I just thought this situation was none of my business.

So my (19M) older brother (22M) has been with his wife Maria (24F) since he was 15. They have had the most toxic and frankly demonic relationship I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Maria is actually insane and extremely abusive to my brother and I‚Äôm not just saying that because he‚Äôs my brother.

When they were still dating, my parents tried everything to stop them from seeing eachother. They even sent him to live abroad with our relatives in Europe for a year but guess what maria did? Caught a flight and stayed in hostel nearby. They put him in therapy and pleaded with him to leave her but they‚Äôve stayed together. I don‚Äôt fault him for it because i know relationships like that can mess with your head but it‚Äôs been painful watching my brother suffer like this. He is a grown man and is responsible for his own relationships but she was his first everything and he seems very attached to her even. He also has bipolar disorder that he was diagnosed with at 19 (his psychiatrist suggested that the stress of the relationship could‚Äôve triggered it since it runs in our family) and he thinks that it makes him defective and no one else will want him even though he‚Äôs objectively a great guy. 

He married her after she got pregnant and they have a 1 year old son together. My mother and my brother raise that kid, Maria probably hasn‚Äôt even changed his diaper even once. I‚Äôve probably bathed him more than she has.

Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that my brother has been happier. He‚Äôs been complying with his therapy and meds more and I‚Äôve even caught him singing in the house which is insane if you knew him. He told me that he met a girl and he really liked her. He said that she was really nice, she was forcing him to go to his therapy sessions and she was making him take up his old hobbies again. He also said that being with her is making him feel brave enough to leave Maria. I think cheating is bad but also üëÄ.

Anyway, somehow Maria found out and she went ballistic. She kidnapped their son and it took three days to get him back. The stress of that got my brother put on a psych hold and everyone‚Äôs pissed.

95,1djdlsf,AITA for being uncomfortable with GF talking to old friend,"I (19M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend after being apart for the better of half a year. Within that time I dated around, but wasn‚Äôt exclusive. The people that I dated were friends with benefits and we were friends before the benefits were involved. We‚Äôve been together for 6 months and within those months she‚Äôs gotten on to me for crossing her boundary which is talking to people that make her uncomfortable (which I used to date). The first time I was made aware of this, I distance myself from those people but being in school it was hard to completely avoid them but we got passed it. The 2nd event was when I was in a group setting with someone who I slept with (she‚Äôs a mutual friend of that friend group). That girl texted me a few times. I can admit it was my fault for not letting her know before hand and when she asked if she was there I was completely honest. She asked to check my phone and I let her because I felt like I kept the messages plutonic, and cordial. I let her check my social medias and saw that I was sending reels to and old FWB and that upset her as well. I didn‚Äôt see the reels as big of a deal because they were infrequent due to the fact that she told me she was uncomfortable with that person. The 3rd event was as of a week and a half ago ,where she asked to check my phone, checked Instagram and saw a reel from a few days ago to the ex FWB. She was obviously upset. I told her I would block and delete their numbers, so I did and we talk things though the next day. During the talk I expressed that I don‚Äôt harbor any romantic feeling towards any of them, I wanted to be cordial since I used to be good friends with them before I distanced myself and that I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt think a insta reel meant anything. She brought the question of how I would feel if she started talking to an old friend that she liked. I told her as uncomfortable as it made me feel I trust her enough to make the right choices around him. she followed that guy friend on Instagram which she had previously unfollowed due to their past and him rejecting her. we were doing well after spending time together, but two days ago the guy friend messaged my GF and they caught up, which she told me. I asked her a few questions. She thought it was nice that he texted to catch up, they used to be good friends, she would go to him when we had issues in the past, and she knows that it makes me uncomfortable but she wants me to have a taste of my own medicine. She also promised that there wasn‚Äôt going to be anything going on between them I feel like shouldn‚Äôt be upset because I did break her boundaries more than once so it is the actions of my consequences, but a part of me is upset that she‚Äôs using him to get back me and unfair that she‚Äôs used the same points  that I made when we talked about her boundaries.

99,1djd547,WIBTA if I stopped cleaning until my MIL leaves?,"My MIL came to this contry to visit my BF, she's staying for a week and a day

She's a really nice person and lovely to be around

I usually do the general cleaning; the room, the bathroom, do laundry and sometimes the kitchen as we both tend to do is as my BF is the one who cooks (we both work, he has some more hours currently)

Here's what happened:

- He gave our room to his mom, so I can only get inside to get clothes, she put her things in our closet, floor and desks. We sleep in the couch. Its the first time I met her too
- We have roomates, we share the kitchen/living room and washing machine, they seem a bit uncomfortable
- There's double the laundry as before, his mom changes clothes constantly, and its not possible to do laundry often
- she doesn't clean the bathroom after washing her hands/showering, including the mirror she leaves everything wet, which I have to dry as moss can grow and gets dirty easily, my bf noticed this but he said that is due to her being tired, she uses the bathroom quite often
- she's not aware of the electricity consumption and uses the heating lights, heater (its cold) a lot, leaves lights and things accidentally, unfortunately they are rather high consumption, but my bf didn't seem to explain this
- Unfortunately she doesn't speak English and my BF didn't teach me anything to talk to her, because of this, I didn't want to go to visit our friends' aunty, they are from the same country, I knew I was going to be excluded from the conversation due to that, he promised he was going to translate for me, story short, I was sitting for three hours doing and saying absolutely nothing, I wasn't on my phone because I thought it would have been disrespectful, and the place was and hour away
Anyways, I cried that day
- when he work and I'm not, I was the one taking her mom around, he did apologise for making me a""babysitter"", after I don't have time left to do work or things I want. She wakes up early too, once she was staring at us for 20minutes when we were sleeping, because she wanted us to wake up around 6am, I find this hilarious though
- we work on my bday, and is also the same day she leaves, it was a coincidence and not a big deal, but I thought it was worth mentioning

So far he apologised for everything after I mentioned it

Today he did laundry while I was at work, but instead of asking (he was going to) he put the wrong laundry basket with our working clothes that we wash separately and that wasn't even 1/3 full, instead of the laundry basket that was way more than full (which is also the one his mom uses, alongside our normal clothes). and he left a dirty brush we use to clean in the sink, which was left all wet again

Its three more days until his mom leaves, I was thinking of doing nothing of the stuff I tend to do, like laundry (he said he was going to do it) and just clean after myself

This got me into school for summer 4.5 weeks into the semester and paid for my remaining spring balance. I was given a week and a half to get every module in by June 16th for two classes. That was a week and a half ago and we ended on module 6 in both classes on the 16th.

During the time that I worked to get more of the 12 total weeks worth of schooling turned in every day, my closest male friend's best friend died. I didn't know about him before because he had never told me about him (we've been friends for seven months), but I let him know I was so sorry and tried to console him the best I could.

aside: I didn't hang out with friends or enjoy free time at any point during this week and a half.

We texted and called the next day and that was when I let him know that I was working ten hours a day /night) after my full time job to catch up on everything and turn in twelve weeks of assignments, readings, notes. I didn't tell him about it in a way where l acted like it was more important but in a way where I offered reasoning for why I wasn't able to come see him even though I wanted to. 

Fast forward a week, he confronts me for not being there for him and calls me narcissistic, even though I had texted him every day and asked him how he was doing, what he was up to, how work was, and even answered some of his calls  when I was in the middle of an assignment.

We got through that after a hard conversation, but then tonight | meet him at a bar where l apologize profusely for not being there and give him a heartfelt hug and he keeps going on about how I wasn't there for him. 

I tell him I'm sorry many times and that I only finished my assignments on Father's Day with only 4 minutes to spare and that I promise that if I could have been there in person for him I would have. 

I keep trying to explain to him that me texting and reaching out was me trying to show him whenever I could that I cared. I have done a lot for this person and it seemed like as soon as I couldn't be there when they demanded, I wasn't worth respect for my own experience.

He kept comparing my school chaos to his friend's death to say what I had going on was not as important. 

By the end of the argument he had said he'd done the same thing before (referring to high school) and that a masters is no different, education isn't everything, I was gaslighting him, privileged, and toxic. 

By the end I had cursed at him when I stormed off, said fu, and remained firm in that I no longer wanted to have the conversation, be interrupted, or told how l'm allowed to feel. AlTA for not going to see him until today?

By the end I had cursed at him when I stormed off, said fu, and remained firm in that I no longer wanted to have the conversation, be interrupted, or told how l'm allowed to feel. AlTA for not going to see him until today?

Edit: when I told him I didn‚Äôt want to have the conversation anymore he told me he would pay for everything if I left. I told him several times that I could pay for myself and he said he‚Äôd just pay for it and to leave. Then when I finally leave, he texts me saying, ‚Äúbro you owe me $30.‚Äù mind you I have driven him so many places and picked him up many times due to him not having a car.

101,1djd2ya,AITA for having a side conversation with my aunt at my family b-day dinner ,"First, some context. I (23 F) am turning 24 tomorrow, and went back home for a week to see family and friends. I moved out just under a year ago to attend grad school ‚Äî so between moving out for the first time and demands of school, I haven‚Äôt been home much. Also important is that my dad passed when I was 10, and I‚Äôm an only child and adopted ‚Äî my mom and I spent a lot of time together. We definitely had our ups and downs, but the past few years have felt better.

 We were having a really lovely round of appetizers, my mom (68), my aunt (66), my uncle (70) and my grandma (92) all chatting together. During dinner my aunt asked me a question about my bed frame ‚Äî it was maybe a 5 min back and forth. My mom made a comment about ‚Äúhow we should include everyone in the conversation.‚Äù It made dinner a bit tense. I didn‚Äôt address it because it felt awkward.

It was cake time, I served it, and my grandma asked what‚Äôs my next adventure. I had already shared to my mom about wanting to do a meditation retreat after I finish my masters, so shared it to the rest of the family at the table. As soon as I started talking details, she turns to my uncle and says ‚Äúwell, she‚Äôs always on that phone so‚Ä¶‚Äù This was something she had already said to me and I already let her know that the comment didn‚Äôt make me feel great. It upset me that she was both rehashing it, and engaging in a side conversation when literally minutes before she was getting frustrated at me for the same thing. I said ‚Äúyou said you wanted the conversation to be inclusive‚Äù and she brushed it off. I admit I didn‚Äôt say it in the kindest tone, and came across as mad. I excused myself to have space to calm down.

The rest of the evening still felt a bit off, but I did get good time with the rest of my family. 

My mom and I tried to resolve it, but she ended up saying that it‚Äôs so disrespectful to have a ‚Äúprivate conversation‚Äù when my uncle and grandma have nothing to contribute to the topic. I felt like she was upset about something else, because that situation seemed really small and inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. I asked her and it ended in her raising her voice saying that I don‚Äôt love her, that I love my aunt, that I‚Äôm so critical of her and am ‚Äúon my aunts side.‚Äù 

I feel incredibly lost? Is it rude to have side conversations in a smaller group (of 5) like that? Should I have addressed her initial comment? I assume that my mom is hurting about something else (probably me growing up and us not spending as much time together), but the reaction seemed so intense I just wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt way off base.

103,1djcxrv,AITA in a situation like this ,"I (27m) have been living in an apartment unit with my uncle for almost 6-7 years now. The apartment is under my aunts name, but she no longer lives here & my uncle sort of took over. The unit is occupied by my uncle, and his wife, me and my gf who has been staying with me, and two individuals that work at our family restaurant. There is a total of 6 people staying in a three bedroom, two story apartment. 

I live in one of the bedroom upstairs and since 2021/2022, i've been dealing with bed bugs. The infestation has spread pretty much to every corner in my room. I've moved my bed around each corner, and decluttered to where it's just my computer set up, my bed in the middle, and my clothes in the closet. (Before you say, i've been on r/bedbugs) I've sprayed and sprayed chemicals, i've done it all, but they do not go away. It's fucking with my mental health, and I just get so frustrated and angry some days. I'm usually a chill laid back person. 

I've told my uncle numerous times to tell the property owner/landlord for months on end. Since they aren't dealing with it in there room, it's not a big deal to them. I seem to be the only person dealing with this in our unit, and I know they didn't come from me. (Perhaps APT B, the next unit over) I tell my mom, and my aunt and they just don't take me serious. I show them the bites and the black dark spots on the wall, still.. not that serious to them. The only thing the landlord has done was give me a bottle of spray to use for them. I've used it but now they hide in the carpet. I can't even be barefoot at night in my own room. I need to wear socks and slippers. 

Because of the lack of communication, and the frustration getting more extreme, I filed a complaint with the city and the health department. They responded back to me, and they responded to the property owner. Now the landlord is pissed, and he wants to speak with my uncle this week. My uncle, is scared that the landlord will evict us, since we have 6 people living here. He's worried that we will all have to move out. He almost looked like he was going to cry.

My baby is 14months old boy now.
December 2023 my SIL posted a public before & after photos (before only of her, after she was holding my son) the post read ‚ÄúWhat a difference 9months makes‚Äù.

He claimed I always have something against her. He also picked her up brought her to our house only for her to verbally abuse & insult me. She said ‚Äúblood is thicker than water‚Äù hence her & her kids should be prioritised by my husband before me. When I said ‚Äúif anything is happening regarding my son I need to be informed as Im a mother‚Äù, she said that I am controlling. She told me to shut up, etc.

I have this friend, let's call her Adriana. She NONSTOP brags about every little thing, whether it be her grades, her body, her boyfriend, her spelling, the fact that she could type without looking at the keyboard (no seriously), and if our conversation wasn't about her, she would make it about her.

In case you're wondering, I didn't want to ""just stop talking to her"" because I really enjoyed talking to everyone else in our friend group, and everyone was very connected with her.

We had this group project in my English class, where we had to act out a part of Romeo and Juliet. There were five parts to play, and five people in our group. Perfect!

Unfortunately, Adriana didn't want to be on camera, or get her hair dirty by lying on the ground (it was required of the parts), so instead of choosing one of the five appointed parts, she refused to even be in the play, and instead opted to be the cameraman and editor.

I was annoyed, because we all had more work to do and more lines to memorize, but it was whatever. It was just a short project.

But NO. It was the day that we had to start recording, and she refused to record. She wanted to work on other assignments. We all had other assignments to work on, but this recording was crucial, because it was the last day that we had to work on it.

I ended up having to record and edit. But because she's popular in our friend group and no one wanted her to fail the project, they had me send her the finished video so that she could add subtitles, so that she could say she ""participated"".

I finished editing the video, and I sent it to her, but she wasn't happy about one part of the video (the audio) and told me she wanted me to change it. I said no, because it was really late and it would have been an absolute pain to go back in and fix it.

It's late at night, and she sends the video back to me. She completely cut the audio of the part that she didn't like. It had an important line that needed to be said, but she just snipped it out. It was two in the morning, but this project was worth a lot of points, so I went back in and fixed it, but in doing so, I had to delete the subtitles.

I submitted the video, but later when the teacher was playing it in class, Adriana complained loudly, ""She cut out the subtitles I added! I spent TWO HOURS on it!!""

I said, ""You cut out important audio."", but she denied it.

We all ended up getting a hundred on the project. Even her, with her minimal effort. :/

107,1djc8tp,AITA for going out with my guy friends without any girls?,"I F19 have been asking my girl friends to go see a movie for the last few weeks and they always say they‚Äôre not up for it or they prefer to do something more exciting. I really enjoy movies and we used to go all the time and even sneak food in but they never want to go anymore. Finally my friend, Jenna, F20 says she would be down to go and we made a plan for today to see a movie at night. 

This is where stuff gets a bit more complicated, last night she and my other friend Rachel, F20 hung out without me and said nothing and then when they realized the party they were at was boring, they messaged our groupchat (with our boy friends included) and asked us to join them. I honestly hate feeling like a second option and I passed. The boys did the same but said we can hang today instead, Jenna and Rachel agreed. 

Today the boys messaged me, they tend to try to communicate through me usually because to come across as some sort of pick me, I knew them since I was like 7 and our families are very close, we have a really healthy friendship filled with boundaries and mutual respect.  Anyways, they asked me what we were doing so I said me and Jenna are gonna see a movie, they asked if they are invited so I asked Jenna and she said she doesn‚Äôt want the boys to join us for the movie, I said okay and asked what I should tell them. She said she actually doesn‚Äôt mind she‚Äôs just worried about her boyfriend, so I asked her if she prefers I just tell the boys flat out that Jenna and I are going without them or if she wants to tell her boyfriend first. In my opinion that‚Äôs a stupid thing to have to do but I digress, I respect their relationship. Anyways she said okay she would see, thirty minutes later she said ‚Äúmy boyfriend said he‚Äôs taking me‚Äù.

She went on to say that she feels bad because they haven‚Äôt seen each other in a while (they saw each other two days ago) and she can always see me tomorrow. So she cancelled our plan (third time this month) for her boyfriend. Just to clarify (if it wasn‚Äôt clear enough) I just wanted to watch a movie with her like we used to and I was really excited to see the movie we were gonna watch.

I F19 have been asking my girl friends to go see a movie for the last few weeks and they always say they‚Äôre not up for it or they prefer to do something more exciting. I really enjoy movies and we used to go all the time and even sneak food in but they never want to go anymore. Finally my friend, Jenna, F20 says she would be down to go and we made a plan for today to see a movie at night. 

This is where stuff gets a bit more complicated, last night she and my other friend Rachel, F20 hung out without me and said nothing and then when they realized the party they were at was boring, they messaged our groupchat (with our boy friends included) and asked us to join them. I honestly hate feeling like a second option and I passed. The boys did the same but said we can hang today instead, Jenna and Rachel agreed. 

Today the boys messaged me, they tend to try to communicate through me usually because to come across as some sort of pick me, I knew them since I was like 7 and our families are very close, we have a really healthy friendship filled with boundaries and mutual respect.  Anyways, they asked me what we were doing so I said me and Jenna are gonna see a movie, they asked if they are invited so I asked Jenna and she said she doesn‚Äôt want the boys to join us for the movie, I said okay and asked what I should tell them. She said she actually doesn‚Äôt mind she‚Äôs just worried about her boyfriend, so I asked her if she prefers I just tell the boys flat out that Jenna and I are going without them or if she wants to tell her boyfriend first. In my opinion that‚Äôs a stupid thing to have to do but I digress, I respect their relationship. Anyways she said okay she would see, thirty minutes later she said ‚Äúmy boyfriend said he‚Äôs taking me‚Äù.

She went on to say that she feels bad because they haven‚Äôt seen each other in a while (they saw each other two days ago) and she can always see me tomorrow. So she cancelled our plan (third time this month) for her boyfriend. Just to clarify (if it wasn‚Äôt clear enough) I just wanted to watch a movie with her like we used to and I was really excited to see the movie we were gonna watch. The boys haven‚Äôt seen me in a while since some of them don‚Äôt live in our country anymore due to university and they still wanted to do something so I went to see the movie with them.

109,1djc1r9,AITA for asking my roommates to not pay double rent for a month when I‚Äôm moving out and they are staying in the house ,"My roommates girlfriend moved in with us about a year and a half ago. We‚Äôre in a 2 bedroom 1 bath house so they‚Äôve been sharing a room since she moved in. Total rent is $2300 a month. When she moved in I didn‚Äôt want to make it a big deal so we split rent with me paying $1033 and them each paying $633 or $1266 total (bedrooms are about the same size). I thought this was a pretty nice deal for them but I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it because it was cheaper rent than a lot of comparable options. Things have gone pretty well all things considered and there‚Äôs no tension between us, but I decided about 6 months ago I would move out so they can have the house on their own. The lease runs through July 31st and I just signed a lease on a new place that starts July 1st. I plan to move out the first week of July and figured I would ask if they wanted to prorate the rent for the last month. For example, I‚Äôd pay about $258 for the week I was still there in July. I thought they could do me a solid since they‚Äôve saved a lot since she moved in and will have the house to themselves for most of the month. When we talked about it my friend was fine with it but his girlfriend wanted me to pay my normal rent for the whole month. She said she is worried about paying her portion of the security deposit ($1150), which she never payed originally since my friend and I covered it before she moved in. I get that it‚Äôs tough to pay the security deposit and more rent than she‚Äôs used to in the same month; however, I just had to cover a new security deposit, moving expenses, application fees and will now have to pay 2 months rent so that they can have the house to themselves. She has also known this was coming for about 6 months. Technically she‚Äôs right and I signed a lease through July 31st, but I consider all of us friends and am a bit disappointed that she wasn‚Äôt more willing to compromise. Double rent for one month isn‚Äôt going to break me and I‚Äôve been saving for it, but I feel like if the roles were reversed and I was the one taking over the lease I wouldn‚Äôt ask them to pay for the month at all.

Edit - Appreciate the responses and wanted to provide some additional info. Prob should have included this from the start but we‚Äôre renting from my friend‚Äôs mom. She didn‚Äôt lower rent for us (I don‚Äôt think she should have but feel like a lot of people ask that). Because it‚Äôs his mom a lot of the lease and renting has been more flexible. Up until two months ago none of us were really sure when this lease officially ended we just agreed that I‚Äôd move out towards the beginning of the summer. I do feel like this vibe played into me assuming we would work something out as friends. Also security deposit wise the girlfriend never paid it because she moved in six months after we had been living there. My friend‚Äôs mom is just asking that she pay my portion and I‚Äôll get mine back from her so that she has a whole deposit. In regard to deposits I also paid a $500 pet fee (non refundable) when I moved in with my dog at the start of us living there. Last year they got a puppy and didn‚Äôt pay any fee, not sure if it‚Äôs because I covered it or if his mom just cut him slack.

110,1djbtsc,AITA for not dog sitting anymore due to fleas?,"Hello! So I (27f) dog sit my coworkers (35?m) puppy occasionally while he's working. We've had some disagreements and difference in opinions regarding his decisions that I'll list below as background info:

A) I believe the pup is around 12 weeks but we're not entirely sure, but he's had her for about 3 to 4 weeks and this dog has not been alone for more than 30 minutes at a time. If he'd working he has someone dog sit, he brings her to the bar, the grocery store, a concert. Absolutely everywhere. Me and some others warned him about separation anxiety but he's brushed us off every time it's mentioned. He asked me to sit because he was going to be gone for an hour and a half max. She is house trained but not crate trained. 

B) She has not been to the vet at all because he wants a vet that will take a walk in appointment and see him almost immediately. I tried to tell him most vets don't operate like that and his response was that they obviously don't want his money and if they were a good vet they'd see him regardless. I've offered to make the appointment and take her myself and he refuses.

C) the main issue is - the last two to three times I've had her (he drops her off at my house) I've picked fleas off of her. I've told him this and even picked one off of her right in front of him and showed him and advised he gets her treated.
He asked again today if I could dog sit. I asked if he'd gotten her treated for fleas yet and he said no. 
I asked if he could because I have 3 cats and already had to bomb my house last summer because we had them so bad. His response was to trust him that she was flea free. I reminded him that I personally have picked fleas off of her and he said that they must've come from my yard because he bathes her daily in flea shampoo(. 
I didn't want to argue and simply said that we treat our yard for fleas after the fiasco last summer and to ask our coworker because it wasn't worth the risk of having to bomb or  put my cats through that misery again. 


Any time anyone even hints at questioning his decisions he gets defensive and accuses us of thinking he's a bad dog owner or abusive or that he doesn't know what he's doing because he's ""had 5 dogs over his lifetime and didn't have a problem"". I've never said I think he's a bad owner. I just advised he do the necessary things especially since many people have offered to help do those things. 

He has ignored my messages so far so I just want to know if I'm blowing things out of proportion.  I treat my cats with prescription flea meds (Revolution Plus for anyone whose wondering) but it just doesn't seem worth the risk to me after the chaos last summer with fleas. I also feel like just bathing her in shampoo isn't helpful for fleas that jump on her afterwards and isn't a real solution..

He had to be out of town for a couple days, so his mom told me that I could go sleep at her place but I told her no because I hate sleeping there as it's quite claustrofobic and she gets up really late (11am) as opposite to me, as I get up around 7am daily. I'm also having some trouble sleeping as my belly is huge at this stage of pregnancy. 

Anyway, today at around 3:30am someone rang on my doorbell, I didn't answer thinking it might have been a drunk or someone ringing the wrong door. But they didn't stop. I have anxiety so I started to panic,  creating all kind of scenarios in my head, from my BF having an accident, to a fire, to someone trying to hurt me. 

I got some courage and look through the camera and realize it was my MIL. I panicked even more, thinking that definitely something bad had happened to my BF. 

Turns out it didn't. 

She was just nervous about me being on my own and decided it was a good idea to come and wake me at 3:30 am. She is well aware of my anxiety. She had some trouble changing her SIM card so she couldn't call me so she came here. 

I had a medical check up at 8:50 am, and some other plans for the day that now are completely ruined since I couldn't sleep afterwards. 

I had tachycardia and Braxton Hicks contraccions because of the scare. I'm really pissed off though I do understand she was just caring about me, but I truly think she crossed a line. I did make her know that she scared me but she pretty much told me that it was my fault for not wanting to sleep at her place.

Every year on the 3rd weekend of July, F and I go on a ‚Äòjuly trip‚Äô with friends where we drink, smoke, and play games/watch movies for 4 days. I‚Äôve gone the last 3 years, F has gone the last 4. 

My family also has a reunion every year- except the host changes each year in a pattern of 5 people, so I only have the chance to go every 5 years as my other relatives live too far away. Normally this reunion is always held on the *second* week of July, but this year just so happened to be changed bc of scheduling issues. I didn‚Äôt find this out until yesterday, about 4 weeks beforehand. 

I bring it up to F, saying i‚Äôll give him a day to think about it, but I‚Äôd like to skip the july trip this year to go to my family‚Äôs reunion. I have some pretty old family members I haven‚Äôt seen since a kid I‚Äôd like to catch up with, as well as family that‚Äôs never even met my husband yet because they live so far. Also, we can only attend this reunion every 5 years, while the july trip is every year- not to mention we‚Äôre close with the ppl we go with and see them multiple times throughout the year too. 

F got very quiet and seemed a little irritated. He said the july trip is his ‚Äòemotional reset‚Äô for every year, he‚Äôs really been looking forward to it, and this is short notice to ask. Which I get, but in all honesty felt a little selfish to hear. For context, F has the option to go out drinking with friends any night he chooses & has spent weekends out in the past. 

So, is F the AH for caring more about our friends than my family? Or am I the AH for asking F to change something he‚Äôs been looking forward to on such short notice? 

Edit for clarity. I forget ‚Äònormal‚Äô marriages don‚Äôt quite look like mine: I‚Äôm autistic and don‚Äôt drive (working on getting my license) and we only have 1 car, so F and I going to each do our own thing isn‚Äôt really an option.

I have had a problem with my parents for a long time, ever since my dad got fired whenI was 12, my life has been a lot harder for me. The day he got fired was the day I was supposed to go out to eat to celebrate my perfect repot card for the quater.  My dad said we could'nt do it anymore becuase we couldnt afford it. I was pretty sad becuase I ahd been looking forward to it all week.

Later my dad started to pile more work on to me, I had to start doing more chores around the house and he just lay back and played video games all day, my Mom always helped me out with the chores but she had to work double to keep paying for everything. My dad started to fall into depression without his work. I tried to convince him a few times to look for a new job but he was convinced he was'nt going to ever find one as good as his old one so he never even tried to get  job.

Over the years I got more and more chores stacked on top of me and I wasn't even getting paid for them, it got to the point were sometimes I wouldn't even have time to do anything besides school, work, and chores. My dad finally got a new job working as a deli counter cashier at a local grocery store and it seemed to make him happier.

On Father's Day the other day I got fed up with all the work I had to do, especialy since my dad was being outragous with his request even though he hasnt been a very active father to me in years, he still acted like he was entitled to treat me like a slave on father's day so i refused to give him anything for fathers day and yelled at him s=when he asked me to move his water slightly closer to hime so he could take a drink more easily. I yelled about how he wasnt a father to me anymore so he wasnt entitled to boss be around anymore and that I didnt owe him anything.

My dad kicked me out of the house and now i'm living with my freind at his house, he said that I acted to harsly and that I shouldn't have acted so mean to my dad becuase he was trying his best to be a good father, I dont think he was trying to be a good dad becuase he never spent time with b=me and when he  was home, he was always slobbing around.

I have had a problem with my parents for a long time, ever since my dad got fired whenI was 12, my life has been a lot harder for me. The day he got fired was the day I was supposed to go out to eat to celebrate my perfect repot card for the quater.  My dad said we could'nt do it anymore becuase we couldnt afford it. I was pretty sad becuase I ahd been looking forward to it all week.

Later my dad started to pile more work on to me, I had to start doing more chores around the house and he just lay back and played video games all day, my Mom always helped me out with the chores but she had to work double to keep paying for everything. My dad started to fall into depression without his work. I tried to convince him a few times to look for a new job but he was convinced he was'nt going to ever find one as good as his old one so he never even tried to get  job.

I also do this with other English speaking accents a la Kiwi, Australian etc. Melbourne and Edinburgh being prime examples. It's usually with French and Italian food/geography. The Italian words I learned as a kid from my father. He is not Italian but lived there and speaks Italian. This meant that he said a lot of Italian words commonly used in English with their Italian pronunciation, so I learned them that way. The French I learned in school. My friend says I am an asshole because it disrupts conversation and makes it more difficult to communicate. This all started because I said Haiti the French way which is very different from how it is pronounced in English. She says that there is no legitimate reason to do so and it slows conversations down which is annoying. In my brain the words I say are just pronounced the way I say them. Sometimes it's because I learned them that way as a kid, and other times it's because my brain decided one is just more fun to say than the other and permanently rewrote it.  Am I the asshole for not taking the time to self correct these ""jarring"" changes to an otherwise standard Utah accent?

Edit: 
So, I have learned to accept that even if I am not an asshole in everyone's opinion, it is still obnoxious to do to people who don't know the whole context of your life or have expressed their dislike for it. It is the socially responsible thing to moderate my speech even if it is learned behavior. I guess I am an adult who could have probably figured this out on my own, but I do appreciate everyone's civil words. Sucks to have to be responsible and in control of the things in my brain and the words that come out of my mouth. Why would anyone curse me with this responsibility???
Thanks again for the constructive feedback. My friend will be very appreciative when she reads this tomorrow.

I was just wondering if I'm an asshole. I think I've come to the conclusion that I agree with all the people who say it's obnoxious. If it disrupts communication then I should adapt because language is truly for communication. Sorry to all ya'll that I got into arguments with. I'm not going to always stop saying words the way I naturally do, but I'm going to be much more aware of context.

124,1dj9pb5,AITA for demanding $1000 for a dent,"While enjoying chori-queso at a local Mexican restaurant, someone backed into my car and drove off. I didn't notice the damage until my father pointed it out the next day. Reviewing my rear dashcam, I found the culprit's license plate‚Äîa newer VW SUV. I recognized the man as the guy who waited for his food near the bar. He hit my car, inspected his own, glanced at mine, and then drove away.

I called the local police to report the damage and provide the footage. The officer assured me it would be an open-and-shut case and that he would contact the other driver in the next few days to get their side of the story.

The officer called me the next Monday with mixed news: the driver received two major tickets‚Äîone for leaving the scene of the accident and another for lacking insurance, which was surprising given his vehicle was a 2020 VW SUV. He was rushing while doordashing, according to him. The officer provided me the driver's contact details, and my experience with the PD was positive overall.

The next day I stopped by a local Maaco and got an estimate for the damage. the guy took one look and said I needed a new bumper. With the $1700 quote in hand I popped in to discuss the situation with my agent. He gave me a few options:

	1.	do nothing. I have decent equity and the reduced resale probably wont impact me too bad when I go to sell(2019 Sentra)
	2.	Pay for the repairs out of pocket
	3.	call the guy and get him to pay for the repairs
	4.	file a claim and the insurance company will decend on him with the might of thor for my $1000 deductible.(subrogation)

After pondering my options for a day, I decided to file a claim to address the damage on my bumper. Instead of sending the insurance company after him, I chose to give the other driver the chance to cover the deductible himself, which seemed fairer to him financially over paying everything. However, when I called him, he explained he couldn't afford the $1000 due to financial strain from his Doordash work. Despite his alleged situation, I proceeded with filing the claim, suggesting the insurance might work with him for reimbursement. We mutually agreed it was the best course. Ultimately, I forgave him and expressed I would have preferred he handled the situation differently.

I filed the claim shortly after and it's now in progress. Reflecting on this, I wonder if involving my insurance was an overreaction, especially since the tickets seemed like sufficient justice. Initially assuming his VW was insured, I felt a twinge of anger upon learning otherwise. Doordash conducts periodic background checks and may deactivate him due to the tickets, which added to my conflicted feelings.

125,1dj9flc,AITA for implying my friend should drop out of a game we play because they keep needing to cancel at the last second?,"I (24 NB) have been in a friend group with several online friends for five years, and one thing we do is play D&D. I run a game every Friday and every other Wednesday, while another member (24 M, who I'll call John) runs a game on the other Wednesdays. 

About a year ago, a player (24 NB, it/its pronouns, let's call it Alex) had a bunch of health concerns get bad. It's living with chronic pain and fatigue. Even though it's getting treated for this, the symptoms aren't just going away, obviously, and we've been accommodating. But Alex insists that it's alright to play with us every week, but most weeks it'll be silent come game time until we've been waiting for about half an hour to start, and then it'll say it can't play. It's also expressed that it's not okay with us playing without it. We're very frustrated with it cancelling on us most weeks without so much as an apology, we'd be happy if we got an hour or two of notice so we could do something else.

We also noticed a pattern of needing to cancel John's game much more often than mine.

Eventually, I promise to talk to it about it, and, after procrastinating a lot, send Alex a message asking if it was up to John's game, explaining that I know that it's not cancelling to be an ass, and that health takes priority over us playing, but I'd noticed that it doesn't cancel my games as much.

It said that it did feel bad for needing to cancel and that it did love to play, but it was just exhausted all the time.

I clarify that I understood, but it did seem as if it cancelled John's game consistently, which made me feel guilty, so I just wanted to make sure. I also brought up the fact that if Alex is extending itself too far and if it feels like it needs a break every other week, we'd understand. I told it that we'd miss it if it did need to drop out, but that I would much rather it do what it needs to do for its own health since it is my friend and I want to make sure it's okay.

It then sends a message to the group chat, clearly angry, saying that if everyone wanted to assume shit, we should just kick it from the game and be done with it, citing the time zone difference (it is 3 hours behind the rest of us) and its fatigue, and that it doesn't have the energy to put up with being accused of not liking something when it never said that it didn't. This was a surprise to everyone, including myself, because I'd been trying to keep it in dms.

I sent Alex one more message saying that I wasn't trying to imply that it actively didn't like John's game, only that I was worried that that game drained its energy more or something, and that I just wanted to make sure it was okay. It then set its status to 'No dms' with no further response so far.

Asshole or not, I'm doing my best to take full responsibility for the situation, for better or worse, since I was the one who insisted I would talk to Alex about it.

The reasoning for her wanting a divorce is simple -- she doesn't feel like she loves him romantically, but is willing to continue living with him (and even rekindling their romantic relationship) after my brother and I go off to college, IF AND ONLY IF he takes drastic steps to fix his behavior. She has brought up a divorce before, many, *many* years ago, and he said that ""if she did, she would never be able to get the kids, because of the justice system in America."" So, she's decided to wait until her kids are legal adults and in college. 

My father knows nothing about any of her currently wanting to get a divorce -- for all intents and purposes, she dropped it after that one mention years ago. He's currently ""retired"" (unemployed and refuses to get a job, but my mother is absolutely wealthy for us alone) and in his late 50s, but his biggest issue is his behavior. Speaking from my perspective as his daughter, he used to hit my brother and I (not full on beatings, but fairly solid whacks -- although he's stopped doing that), is very uncooperative and unresponsive, isn't a good listener or communicator, picks verbal fights over very childish problems (ex. spilling juice on the counter) and constantly speaks with an angry/irritated tone. I can get around these things by arguing back at him, but my mother doesn't bother to fight back anymore, instead finding it easier to just ignore is childish antics/problems and just divorce him in 4 years.

He has literally nothing else in his life (no friends, few hobbies, no job, etc.), so I think it would actually be extremely damaging to his physical and mental health.

132,1dj88d2,AITA for going through my best friends phone? FAKE NAMES (help im sad and gay),"Okay, so I (F18) and my best friend (F18) Melanie have been best friends for 6+ years. I had some romantic feelings for her in previous years, but we talked them through, and they went away. 

I had heard from a few of my other friends that Melanie had been talking shit about me, saying I was "" in love with her again"" ""wouldn't leave her alone"" etc. While I admit I had been asking to see her more recently, it wasn't romantic. This made me super anxious. She and I had always had good communication and never fought. She had left her phone out and left the room and my impulse got the better of me. (we know each others passwords just in case) I grabbed her phone and looked up my name in iMessage; she had told people i was ""overwhelming/annoying as fuck"" and ""can we please not bring her im low-key around her enough as is"" I freaked. My two friends walked up to me, saw I was freaking out, and I told them everything. The mean texts, rumors, I also revealed to them that she also had feelings for our friend Sally. They were super supportive and said I needed to talk to Melanie about what I had heard but not about going through her phone. On my way home from school I went to In and Out because I was sad and craving fries. Without even walking through the door I saw all of my friends sitting and eating food without me. one of them looks out the window and goes ""omg guys look"" and they all turn to see me burst into tears and run to my car. They proceeded to do absolutely nothing and I was heartbroken. my friends including Melanie and sally said nothing to me. no calls or texts for over 4 hours until I finally had to break the silence. I texted Melanie asking what I had seen and she said it was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I won't go into a lot of detail but we talked for 5 hours we went THROUGH it, but we had things figured out. my love for her and our friendship led me to brush off the mean texts and things, because she seemed to actually care. Melanie told me about her feelings for our friend, Sally, and I said I was in full support because I knew Sally liked her too. Remember those two friends I told about the situation earlier? yeah, the next day they told Melanie AND sally that I went through Melanies phone. they texted me calling me crazy and obsessed and I completely violated their privacy. I tried to apologize and explain but they said they didn't want to hear anything from me. I dont know how much of the situation they were told but I gave them both letters explaining my side of things and apologizing to hopefully help us all get the whole story. but they haven't spoken to me at all.(they started dating btw). a few friends have reached out saying their reactions are over dramatic given the fact that I explained and apologized. Still, other people have said Melanie and Sally want to cut me out of their lives entirely. Melanie never truly apologized for talking shit about me, but I don't even care, I don't want to lose my two best friends.

EDIT- okay i did i bad job at writing this tbh, but this all happened over the span of 3 days and my emotions were running high, im a senior in high school and everything was catching up to me (i know that doesn't excuse my actions all that much though)

I totally understood, so I apologized, but explained that I meant no offense and I was only coming from a place of concern. Regardless, I told her that I know now not to do it again. We hashed it out a bit longer, then she eventually apologized too.

I (18F) am currently having a pretty big fight with my boyfriend (19M) about my birthday this Friday. 
For some context we have been together for two years.

Next, he will proceed to express how I‚Äôm too good at giving gifts for him to compare. Now, I understand that not everyone has a knack for gift giving. I love the surprise factor of gifts so for me to tell him straight up what I would like really takes the fun out of it for me, which I have conveyed to him.

So, I pick out a couple of vague things that I would enjoy and send the list to him over text. So, I go out to the store and while I‚Äôm away he texts me saying ‚ÄúWhat art products do you like?‚Äù This was not in my list. Confused, I ask why he would bring up art stuff when I gave him a list of what I liked. At this point I am a little fed up because it has happened for every holiday. So I ask in return, if I do tell you exactly what I would like for my birthday could you do it? He responds with ‚ÄúYes for the love of God. That‚Äôs all I want.‚Äù I was unhappy already but this kind of set me off a bit. I told him ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say for the love of god because all I want is for my boyfriend to surprise me with something but that‚Äôs obviously hard so, I would like you to pick a place and take me on a date.

When she got home I asked her if she brought it back and she said yes. However after asking for it multiple times she confessed that she left it at his house. I was furious

A few days later Calvin had given us a ride somewhere and decided to let us spend the night at his house since it was late and his place was closer. When we pulled up to the house I asked if my portable charger was still in there and Aalachia told me to chill out and stop being rude. I replied with ""No. What's rude is the fact that you took something of mine without permission and left it at your boyfriends house"". 

When we got out of the car she pulled me aside and told me to chill out and stop asking about my charger and to stop being so rude. I told her that I have the right to ask about something that I spent money on and bought for myself and I don't consider it rude to ask about it. When Calvin came over I said ""Either one of you find my charger or one of you owes me the $20 that I spent on it"". Luckily Calvin was very understanding of the situation and he found my charger and I got it back. However Aalachia says that I did the most for no reason and was a very rude and disrespectful asshole towards Calvin. So AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-19,"AITAH for telling my friend and her boyfriend to either return my property or pay me back the money that I spent on it? I (24F) have a roommate named Aalachia (21F). Aalachias not a very considerate person.

137,1dj820z,AITA because I won't help my girlfriend with her vet bills since she chose not to get her dog's tail docked. ,"My girlfriend had to make special arrangements to get a Doberman Pinscher puppy with an intact tail. Most breeders will automatically dock them. 

Well her dog is now suffering from happy tail syndrome. It is when dogs break or injure their tails from wagging it really hard. Dobbies have long, skinny, tails with very little fur. So when he whacks it against something it is really easy for him to hurt it. 

Now she is getting vet bills that are mounting up and she may need to get it docked anyway. 

I had told her that it was going to be a problem but she said that dicking tails is cruel. I think that cosmetic alterations to an animal are cruel. But some things have a reason. 

She wants me to help her with the bills and I do not want to. She made the choice and she should live with the consequences.
