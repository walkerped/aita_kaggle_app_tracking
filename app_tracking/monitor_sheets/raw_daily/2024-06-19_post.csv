0,1dj89nw,AITA for yelling at my dad when he let the dog loose?,"(Sorry for the grammar, I'm still shaken)  
For background, my father and I's relationship has become strained. He recently found out I'm trans (FTM) and told me if I ""continue with this path"" he would leave me and my mother. He also tried to guilt trip me by showing him his paycheck and said that me and my mother would not be able to survive without him.

Last year, me and my family were carrying groceries into the house. My dog (then a five-month-old puppy) went between his legs. He opened them and our dog ran out into the street. I live on one of the busiest streets in my town. My brother got her inside, and I broke down in tears. My father told me I was overreacting and said ""It's just a dog.""

Jump to today: My dad was doing yard work and left the back gate open. I was outside with my mom and noticed it was open just before my dog opened it and ran out. She ran out of the house and was very close to being hit by a car before I managed to get her back in our backyard. I came back to make sure both of our gates were closed.

This is the most important part to me, I returned to my dad having a grin on his face. It looked like he wanted to laugh, and it got me even more mad. I yelled at him ""It's not funny"" before storming into the house. I love my dog so much, and seeing her nearly get hit twice was terrifying. I know I probably shouldn't have yelled, but this is the second time she was let out due to his recklessness.

After around 10 minutes, my dad came back to yell at me saying he worked so hard to clean up the yard and accidentally left the gate open. He never once apologized. I get accidents happen, but I tell him all the time to be careful and that she will run out. Every time I try and warn him about something that could easily happen, he brushes me off and says I'm overreacting. Both times this had happened, he blamed either me or my brother for chasing her (trying to get her inside). My whole problem is that he didn't seem to care at all. He didn't care how I felt, or how something he cherishes could've ended up hurt. Was I overreacting?",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-06-19,"AITA for yelling at my dad when he let the dog loose?

2,1dj7df8,AITA? I am losing my mind. ,"I have never imagined that I would be posting on here to get some guidance but after years of reading others posts and getting some form of relief, I am finally breaking down to try and figure out what to do‚Ä¶

(This is a long one) 

I am in a very specialized and lucrative profession. So is my wife. We have been married 7 years just this past May and were together before our wedding for three years. When we met, we were already both in our respective professions. 

I know my profession has not been easy on her. It requires constant travel and sometimes longer trips over seas. I have always come home and ‚Äúmade it work‚Äù professionally, as long as possible, while I didn‚Äôt have to go elsewhere for work. The pay for the work ‚Äúnearby‚Äù (over 50 miles away) is a fraction of what I get paid for actually doing my job where there is real work to be done. 

We live in a remote area that isn‚Äôt bustling with opportunity. Due to my specialty, there is absolutely no one that will hire me nearby, believe me I‚Äôve tried. I am either too expensive or they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know what to do with me‚Äù and won‚Äôt even give me a chance. 

So what happens is an opportunity will present itself and I will ultimately be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to take it because by that point I‚Äôve been hanging on by a thread to get by. Whenever the job takes me elsewhere, (yes it sucks because I hate being away from my family) my wife is suddenly a single mom and I am a geo bachelor but she never complains about being able to afford everything she wants and needs. When I am home and struggling, of course money becomes a huge fight because she is now the bread winner and is working all the time to try and make up the difference.  It‚Äôs been really tough on both of us in either circumstance. 

Another part that is beyond me is how she never seems to appreciate the fact that when I am home, she is able to keep her job due to the fact that taking our boys to school now 100% falls on me because she works 12 hour shifts and is at work very early and gets home after school has been closed for hours. Never once has she seemed to take into account that I have constantly adjusted my position in my career field to better suit this fact but yet she still has the same exact position and is holding on to it for dear life. 

She is in a demanding profession as well and when we met we both stated that this was important to us; that we both continue to work in our professions that we are proud of. I never imagined having a stay at home wife and she didn‚Äôt ever expect me to be the sole ‚Äúbread winner‚Äù so we have both continued working in our fields. Right now I am currently away from home for work again and she is struggling to keep it all together. This TDY is paying me handsomely to the point she has been able to hire a babysitter for the evenings and takes the boys to school very very early (which is obviously an additional challenge) and I know it‚Äôs tough on her but she is very well taken care of and I‚Äôll be home in a month. 

So here is the dilemma‚Ä¶. 

After 10 years of being together, we have both excelled in our professions. She has never had to travel for work and I always have. So where we are right now is after I return home from this, I have a  position in my profession that will allow me to never have to travel again. The only problem is that it isn‚Äôt near home. We have to move. 

It would mean I can continue to work professionally (and she could as well) and never have to go elsewhere to continue to advance. Home and work would be in the same place. I will also be making enough that she won‚Äôt have to work right away once we move (to give her time to settle in and look for jobs on her own time and get to know the area). She wants to return to work but it‚Äôs nice we won‚Äôt be in dire straits for her to contribute financially. But all she wants to do now is (literally) tell me how narcissistic I am and how I am ‚Äúforcing her‚Äù to leave everything behind for my job and that I am putting my job first and my family second. She has told me this with animosity at least 50 times. 

She is packing the house and planning to move but she is torturing my mind and soul about this whole thing. At the same time she has constantly complained how none of our family (her family lives 4 hours away and mine is 1 hour away) or friends (from life, work, or church) have been there for her but she is holding it against me that I am making her leave all that behind. I don‚Äôt know what to do or say anymore. She makes me feel absolutely insane and helpless. ALL I want is to have my family with me AND be able to do my job so I can continue to take care of us and give us the life we want. Now I can and she is acting like I am her sworn mortal enemy. Please help. I really don‚Äôt know what to say to put her in a better mental state about all this. I am also lost as to why she is making it so torturous on me. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. It‚Äôs like she is trying to sabotage the entire plan but somehow make it my fault because I lost composure dealing with the nonsense of all her irrational emotions. I have tried extremely hard to be patient but I am at a point where I just completely shut down and let her tear me apart but I have no idea of what else to do about it.

3,1dj7bcq,AITA for making my mom ‚Äúsound homophobic‚Äù in front of her coworker?,"Sorry this is on mobile.
My mom forced me out of the closet multiple times when I was younger, yelling at me and telling me I couldn't be gay because I hadn't dated.
She thought talking about this in the McDonald‚Äôs drive-thru in front of my brother was the best time and place to bring this up.
I felt super uncomfortable and just lied about being straight because I didn‚Äôt want my brother giving me shit for it while we were at school.

my official ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù‚Äù was her,my aunt and my cousin basically interrogating me because I looked at rainbow merchandise in a store when I was around 16-17.
They then tried to pick apart if i was ‚Äúreally gay‚Äù. 

She was then surprised I didn‚Äôt feel safe coming out to her, and literally pretended she never yelled at me the last few times she forced me out of the closet. 

Any time I brought up the past, she says they never happened or I‚Äôm remembering it incorrectly, or brought up what I told her in middle-school.
Eventually I just stopped bringing it up because it became pointless.

These past few years, she‚Äôs been asking me to go to Pride or to strip clubs with her.
The thought of going to either of those with her makes me so uncomfortable.

She brought it up again at the dinner and I said ‚Äúno thanks, I‚Äôd really rather not.‚Äù
She kept pressing on about it and her coworker and her wife joined in.
Saying it would be fun and that maybe I‚Äôd find a partner there, there‚Äôs tons of activities,etc.

I kept trying to explain I just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable,
but they kept bringing up different alternative pride events and pressing on about it.
eventually I just got pissed off and yelled at my mom;
‚ÄúYou literally forced me out of the closet several times when I was younger and insisted I was straight, all because of something I told you when I was 13. I didn‚Äôt tell you I was gay because you had me cornered and scared. The thought of going to pride with you makes me feel so anxious and gross I‚Äôd rather die. You haven‚Äôt apologized to me for the shitty things you told me, you don‚Äôt get to join me for the fun things to look good in front of your friends.‚Äù

Her coworker and her wife just gave my mom a ‚Äúwtf‚Äù look, because obviously mom would never tell them about something like that.

Dinner was cut short,we split the bills and  they left.

We got into an argument in the car on the way, and she said I need to ‚Äústop making up shit to make her sound homophobic‚Äù.
I told her she needs to own up to what she did to me

Things have been tense around our house lately, and I avoid her when she‚Äôs home, otherwise it‚Äôs another argument.

I might be the AH because I could‚Äôve made up another excuse or waited till we got home before I said anything and embarrassed her. Her coworker seems super uncomfortable around her and it might be affecting her social life at work.
At the same time, I feel glad I confronted her about this in front of someone else that wasn‚Äôt from our family.

5,1dj7712,AITA for not eating my mom‚Äôs food and leaving it untouched because of my diet? ,"For context, I‚Äôm Latina. My mom loves cooking, she‚Äôs retired now and it has become her new passion to make everything from scratch, bread, burgers, pasta anything. She‚Äôs pretty good at it, and always trying new things. The problem is, she will force you to eat and guilty trip you or scream at you that she‚Äôll never cook again if you don‚Äôt 

I‚Äôm slightly overweight, trying to lose weight. I‚Äôm 20 years old, live with my parents because uni in my country does not have dorms. I feel pressured to appease to all her whims, since they‚Äôre paying for my education. I don‚Äôt go out, I don‚Äôt drink and I only study and work. 
I haven‚Äôt gotten my license yet because where I live the process to get your license is almost 6,000 dollars (if you do the currency exchange) so I don‚Äôt have the means to do that currently, and I also suck at driving.

This means that she drives me to the few places I go when I go out, including the gym.
She usually holds that over my head when I don‚Äôt want to eat her second serving of food, or even a serving of some caloric meal she made, saying she won‚Äôt take me anymore.
I‚Äôm prohibited from using Uber, as it is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù even if I have some money from my internship.

I can take the bus; but when I do she also guilty trips me as it being me rejecting her or something.

Today she made burgers, two even though I only said I wanted one when she asked me how many. This is almost 1000 calories, when I just came back from the gym. I got upset and refused to eat, she made a whole show and the dinner got awkward and quiet.
I feel awful, she does basically everything to me and worked her whole life for me to have a comfortable house and life, and is also paying for my education.

It felt awful leaving the food untouched on the table, specially because it will go to the trash and that‚Äôs wasteful.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-19,"AITA for not eating my mom‚Äôs food and leaving it untouched because of my diet?  For context, I‚Äôm Latina. My mom loves cooking, she‚Äôs retired now and it has become her new passion to make everything from scratch, bread, burgers, pasta anything. She‚Äôs pretty good at it, and always trying new things. The problem is, she will force you to eat and guilty trip you or scream at you that she‚Äôll never cook again if you don‚Äôt 

I‚Äôm slightly overweight, trying to lose weight. I‚Äôm 20 years old, live with my parents because uni in my country does not have dorms. I feel pressured to appease to all her whims, since they‚Äôre paying for my education. I don‚Äôt go out, I don‚Äôt drink and I only study and work. 
I haven‚Äôt gotten my license yet because where I live the process to get your license is almost 6,000 dollars (if you do the currency exchange) so I don‚Äôt have the means to do that currently, and I also suck at driving.

This means that she drives me to the few places I go when I go out, including the gym.
She usually holds that over my head when I don‚Äôt want to eat her second serving of food, or even a serving of some caloric meal she made, saying she won‚Äôt take me anymore.
I‚Äôm prohibited from using Uber, as it is ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù even if I have some money from my internship.

I can take the bus; but when I do she also guilty trips me as it being me rejecting her or something.

Today she made burgers, two even though I only said I wanted one when she asked me how many. This is almost 1000 calories, when I just came back from the gym. I got upset and refused to eat, she made a whole show and the dinner got awkward and quiet.
I feel awful, she does basically everything to me and worked her whole life for me to have a comfortable house and life, and is also paying for my education.

6,1dj6wa2,AITA for arguing with my aunt because she said that my mom was stealing her money?,"So first off a bit of background,

I'm 19M and live with my mom and grandma in my grandma's house in Sri Lanka. my aunts in the USA. My father was abusive and we don't contact him anymore. So since I was little my aunt has been sending money to us for Grandma's medical bills, my school fees, and living costs. she has been doing this every month for 14 years.

Recently my grandma's condition worsened and the spent on her medical bills rose, our family is insanely religious (we are Buddhist but we worship Hindu gods too), so because her condition worsened and because of aunt's own problems she has in her life she asked us to go to a Hindu priest so that he can tell the gods to fix our problems and this costs a lot of money too for travel expenses and other things for the ritual. we have been going there every week for 3 months. so obviously the money that she sent gets spent fast after living costs.

so now the problem is, because the money is being spent fast she has created an idea in her head that my mom is stealing money from her so that she can spend the money on her own. and they have been fighting about this for 3 months and now my other aunt (mom's little sister) has been fueling the fire saying that my mom is stealing money from her. I don't believe my mom is stealing the money but I checked anyway for 2 months and found no evidence of stealing.

today aunt sent money to us and asked me to monitor the spending of her money. so I did. After getting groceries, Grandma's medicine, travel expenses, and paying the water bill that was meant to be paid by my uncle but I guess he's tight on money because he hasn't even called yet. My uncle paying the water bill was started 2 months ago because aunt said he needs to contribute to grandma. and I pay the electricity bill since 5 months ago. I sent receipts to her today and she blew up at me and Mom (mostly Mom) for paying for the water. (i know im the asshole here because i should have asked her first before paying the water bill).

So just now i had a big argument with her over text because she was saying that my mom was stealing her money and i said that she don't need to pay anything anymore because ill pay for everything from now on. Then she said if i can pay for everything give back the money she sent on in those 14 years. After that i clearly you don't want to fix the problem so im stopping responding.

Don't get me wrong, i truly appreciate what she has done all these years but accusing my mom of stealing and trying to throw her out of the house, when she did nothing wrong just pissed me off. My mom literally took care of me and grandma for 14 years and still does to this day.

It was convenient for him to go to this city because his current girlfriend was living there for university. 

So after asking me to come out with him around a week before we go, I decided to tell him I didn‚Äôt want to go.

I had planned to go to my other best friends birthday, Bradley (where we would drink at his). 
And the last time i went out with him and his girlfriend i felt very much I was third wheeling

He would pay for my drinks, drive me there and pay for my coach back (he was going to stay with his girlfriend for the weekend) 
He would get me back in time to be at Bradley‚Äôs by walking me up. 
He brought another friend so i didn‚Äôt third wheel.

I loved the effort but i decided that I didn‚Äôt want to go even with those solutions in place so then he accepted. 

Come the Friday (the day we were supposed to go out) I went into work, now usually i work from home but it was our last day as a team together before we all got separated so we agreed to come in. My manager said she paid for us all to go bowling after work so I thought what the hell, I may as well go. 

The evening got away from me as we started to have a few drinks which most were bought for me. We ended up getting a little drunk and talking shit until maybe about 12/1am which i don‚Äôt think is too late for my standard

It‚Äôs important to note that I have communicated clearly since this process began that I want completely joint custody, but her lawyer and family has convinced her to pursue sole custody on the basis of me being inadequate to take care of my girl‚Äîwhich doesn‚Äôt make sense in itself, because I‚Äôm taking care of her on my own day after day without objection from my ex.",1.0,0.035906263,0,0
12,1dj6g5d,AITA For not cancelling my guys trip?,"I (35M) and my wife (31F) recently began construction on a new home. Thankfully everything has gone smoothly and we are nearing the completion on the home. Our closing date is set and we are scheduled to get the keys to the brand new house in the next couple of weeks. 

Unfortunately - I have a scheduled vacation the week of our closing date. 

This trip of mine is a guys trip that is annual. Every year the guys and I rent a cabin and spend a Wednesday - Sunday board gaming. Our closing day falls on the Friday of my trip. What I plan to do is drive home to complete the closing and sign all the paperwork (it is only about an hour drive) then drive back to rejoin the rest of my group. This trip was planned well in advance - before we ever began construction on our home - and  has long since been paid for. 

Here is the issue: My wife wants me to go to my trip on Wednesday and then leave my trip Friday, cancelling the rest of the vacation and not returning to the rest of the group. She wants me to be present for the move-in. While I completely understand not wanting to move into a house by yourself - I have already gotten this taken care of. I have arranged for a friend of mine who owns a moving company to complete the moving of our stuff into the new home. I have also arranged for TV's to be hung, mirrors to be hung, curtains to be hung, internet to be installed, etc. All of this is scheduled. My wife is very angry with me that I won't cancel my trip and I think it is unreasonable for her to ask me to cancel. This is the one opportunity I get every year to get together with my guy friends to do something we love and it is important to me. I have tried to explain that to her, but she says I am leaving her hanging. Of course it sucks our closing was scheduled in the middle of the trip but that isn't something I could help.

15,1dj66dg,AITA for arguing with my brother because he is unwilling to help at a mass service?,"I (17Nb) had an argument earlier today with my brother ""Oak"" (17M). For context, one of our cousins died at the end of May, and my family was devastated. Our aunt especially, since she was his mother and saw him pass.

Onto the main story. Our aunt wants me and Oak to help out at the mass. No big deal, I'm more than willing to help, and I know Oak is too. The only thing is, our aunt wants us to set up a table for the mass, which means we would have to walk up in front of the group of people attending and place the items for the mass on the table. It would take less than a minute.

I was perfectly okay with this. No big deal, just place items on a table and sit down. Oak, however, was not so okay with it. Our grandma asked him first, because our aunt was messaging her about it rather than us. Oak told her no, that he would not do it. So our grandma told me about it, and I said I would talk to him about it.

Oak had to deal with really bad anxiety all his life, which I understand. My anxiety isn't the best either, and I used to be like him with how I responded to situations. But he told me he refuses to do it because he would ""feel awkward/uncomfortable in front of the crowd."" This is the same brother who dances in front of a crowd 10√ó larger for over five minutes at a time without much worry.

We argued about this. I expressed how I wished he would willingly do it, and how this isn't about him, it's about our cousin. I asked him to do it for our aunt, since I know she will be in shambles at the mass. And I said our aunt doesn't have a lot of options, since the mass is in three days.

He said I was making him out to be a bad person, which I never said nor implied. When he said that, I apologized for how he was taking my words, but that how he was taking it was not how I was meaning it.

He is unwilling to move from his stance and it pains me, especially since our aunt is under a lot of stress because of everything that's happened and could use the help, which I also expressed to Oak. I wish he would be willing to be uncomfortable for a minute for her, or better yet, realize the situation is not about him and no one cares that we will be putting the items down.

AITA?

EDIT: I never said I'm forcing him to do this. Our grandma told him he has to in the end, but I told her I would do it by myself if he still doesn't want to.

EDIT 2: Seeing the comments made me realize I was in the wrong. I apologized to him and he said it's fine. I explained how I said it's not about him, but made it about him, and that was a dick move. I also told him personally I'd be okay doing this by myself, he doesn't have to push himself, and hurting himself for the sake of someone else's happiness, at least in this situation, is not fair to him. I offered to make it up to him, and he said there's no need.
