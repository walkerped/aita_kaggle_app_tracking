0,1dkfpbd,AITA for refusing to share some recipes with my SIL?,"I (34m) love to cook. It's a passion of mine. I really enjoy cooking for others and making my own recipes. Having kids with my husband (33m) made me decide to start my own recipe book so that I can better keep track of stuff our kids love lol. It's also nice to think I could share with them some day, if either loves to cook like me.

My husband's sister aka SIL (37f) and I got along really well for years. We occasionally talked cooking but other stuff was more her thing and therefore ""our thing"". Our relationship changed when my husband and I welcomed our oldest child into the family. My husband believes SIL was jealous of our daughters name because she knew it was his favorite for a girl for several years and she did not get her favorite girl name with any of her three daughters. So she took it out on me because clearly I should have said no and made sure neither of them got their favorite girl name. I can see that being true. I also think she maybe judges the fact I'm the stay at home dad, while my husband gave birth to our kids but became the working dad (he's trans, hence giving birth). Regardless, SIL has not been the same with me since and shows so much attitude! She tosses regular sarcastic comments my way, she's always slightly rude or demeaning to me now. She also insulted my cooking which she always complemented before, saying she had lied all those other times and it always made her puke afterward. I'm sick of it. We hardly ever see her anymore because of this, so much that I would consider us low contact.

The last two family dinners we had with my husbands family, I helped MIL out and did the cooking because she's dealing with some bad arthritis symptoms now. First time I made a veggie stir fry and the second time I made a chicken curry. Food went down really well. SILs kids loved the food I made and she got super frustrated because apparently they don't ever eat well for her or enjoy what she makes. She alluded to this when she asked me to share the two recipes with her. I told her no. I suggested she look up recipes she thought were similar but I told her she didn't get to be rude to me, insult me, and my cooking and then come looking for my recipes.

She called me petty, arrogant and bitchy and claimed I should ""grow the fuck up"".

1,1dk4jj7,AITA for blaming my parents for the way my sister reacted to their other daughter finding us?,"My parents were always open with me (26m) and my siblings (27m, 23m and 22f) about the fact they had another kid before us and gave them up for adoption. But our parents always said they had a son had given up and that we had a brother given up for adoption. That was something they were very clear on.

Not only did they say that but they built my sister up as their only little girl a lot. They'd make it a thing for her to be proud of, she was adored by the family, she was their special little girl, their one and only. She was our only sister and we'd all be a little extra protective of her as her older brothers.

Five months ago we found out they lied when their daughter tracked us down and said she wanted to get to know us/be a part of the family. My parents were so excited. They were hardly able to contain themselves. My sister freaked out and has refused to meet her. She brought up our parents lies and said she was never really as special as they claimed and told them she would never accept a sister and would never accept being made less special. Our parents acted so confused about her reaction. They tried reassuring her and they encouraged her to meet their daughter... it was a mess.

My brothers and I have met this new sister. I met her once and I believe it's the same for my brothers. I felt no instant connection to her and it was just all kinds of awkward. She was really disappointed she didn't get to meet all of us and she came on very strong when we met her which made the awkwardness more awkward. I think she was expecting us to be way more excited than we were and a lot more into the idea of being a family with her. The fact my sister refused to even meet her was something she mentioned 10 different times when she met us.

Apparently she still brings it up, which made my parents bring it up several times to me and to my brothers I'm guessing. The other day they were saying how upset they were that my sister refused to come to moms birthday party because they had invited our other sister. They were saying how they thought she'd handle it better and be excited. I told them it was their fault for lying our whole lives (which they admitted they did, our other sister isn't a trans woman, my parents knew she was a girl) and then hyping my sister up to be their only daughter. I told them the way they did it probably made her feel like she lost their love when it was no longer the truth in her world.

My parents told me I shouldn't blame them. They also accused me of putting my sister before them and their daughter and how clear it is whose side I'm on based on the lack of warmth to their daughter. They also said it was unfair to blame them for the actions of an adult.

2,1djzzfe,AITA not inclined to talk to my old best friend,"I was very close with someone for over 30 years. We considered each other best friends.

In our 30s, we went into business together. After a year, we brought on a third partner who provided financing. My friend was crucial in this relationship, often securing additional investment from the third partner.

The business struggled, and my friend frequently advised me on how to handle the situation to obtain more funds from the investor. These funds were important to cover some of our debts.

The relationship between me and the investor began to sour. He started speaking to me with increasing contempt and eventually gave me an ultimatum: either he or I had to leave the company. He specifically said, ""I don’t like your style.""

I found this disrespectful, considering we had worked together without issues for seven years. My friend didn't defend me. He said, ""Whatever happens, we will still be friends."" I found this odd because it implied he could decide how I would respond, whereas friendship is a mutual agreement.

I suspected my friend was okay with me leaving the business because it reduced the vulnerability around his salary, though I can't say this for sure.

I left the business gracefully that day without making any demands. I was angry and insulted but didn't retaliate.

The two continued to operate and promote the business. It didn't do exceptionally well, but they completely erased my role in its history. They framed it as if the two of them had started the business.

3,1djzwz3,AITA for removing a dashcam which recorded me without my consent,"Ok so I (24M) got a ride from my friend 22F. We were coming home from a party and she agreed to give me a ride home. The drive was pretty long and boring.

We didn't talk much but I did try to kind of flirt with her during the ride. I guess she was kinda annoyed and told me to lay it off. Cause I'm a respectful guy I decided to just stop talking.

Later I see she has a dash cam which records straight through the inside of the car. I was pretty sure it recorded our whole interaction and I was kind of embarrassed. I asked her if I could clear the memory so that our convo wouldn't be recorded. She clearly dismissed my request and said it probably wasn't recording audio anyway and that it would write over at some point.

After a but of thus I decided to just remove the dash cam from the windshield and apparently this struck a serious nerve with her. She said I broke the cable and mount and kept going off on me too. I refused to give her the camera until she showed me how to wipe it but she wouldn't.

Finally she stopped the car and told me to get out in the middle of fcking nowhere and I was forced to take an uber home. I just took the whole camera with me and decided I'd figure this all out later.

She told me I have to pay for the dashcam which is like $200 AND the SD card which is like $80 because its ""damaged"". This is outrageous cause it has to be illegal to be recording people without their consent anyway. I told her I'd give her the (unbroken) camera back but I will keep the SD card cause I need to clear it.

5,1djzmpw,AITA? Cat got locked in the bedroom and my partner is mad at me. ,"Background: Me (34F) and my partner (40M) live in an urban area 1 bedroom apartment. Bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen. Because of reasons my partner sleeps on the couch and I sleep in the bedroom.  We have 1 small dog and 2 cats. The cats aren’t allowed in the bedroom unsupervised because one of them tries to eat my clothes.  

Today I left for work around 8am. My partner didn’t have work today. And was in the living room on the couch all day watching tv, napping on and off, leaving only to smoke a cigarette and run to the deli.  I didn’t get home until 9pm today and found that one of the cats had been locked in the bedroom for an indeterminate amount of time. Possibly since I left.  

It is entirely possible and likely I accidentally shut him in there when I left. He likes to hide under the dresser.  My partner says he didn’t go in and out of the bedroom at all during the day. 

When I realized this I was shocked and a little frustrated that my partner had been here literally all day and noticed the cat was unaccounted for. But I wasn’t going off on him or anything.  However he’s reacting super defensively and making it seem like I’m a jerk for even bringing it up and being frustrated.

Truthfully I think it’s really negligent of him. The cat had no access to water , food, litter box all day.  And we’re in a heatwave. Additionally he could have hurt himself or ingested something. I don’t think it’s wrong of me to have reacted that way when my partner didn’t think to check up on any of the pets over the course of 12 hours. But he refuses to just say “I’m sorry I should have noticed I hope he’s ok” all lame defenses.

7,1djzlf0,AITA for asking a girl “what’s her highest level of education”?,"Im from the UK
I (33F) was at my dad’s birthday party the other day and we invited family and his close friends. My uncle Harry (dads brother) recently divorced from his wife to be with someone younger ‘Jess’. Mum and I are close to my aunt (harrys ex) so we have already had some dislike towards Jess. Mum actually had invited Harry alone with no plus one (aunt refused to come since he was there but their kids came) but he brought her along anyway. Jess looked super young but she said that she was ‘of age’.

Throughout the party she shocked us with a few things she said. 
1. When we were talking about travels, she said Harry brought her to France and it was her first international travel and to a European country. Crowd was stunned and she was denying that she is technically european and UK is in the european continent. She got angry and said “are u lot not up to date? We left europe ages ago” 

2. She thinks north is up
3. She never locks her car because no one can start it without her keys anyway 
4. She thinks having unprotected sex when pregnant with one baby will create twins

This is just what I can remember. Just so you know we didn’t really ask her all of this, the conversation with other ladies went over these subject matters, was hijacked by her each time and she gave us her thoughts on that so it’s not like we were picking on her incessantly. 

The part where I got irritated was when my mom’s friend was asking how my fertility treatments were going. Im on hormonal drugs to induce ovulation. Jess chimed in saying that those drugs won’t do any good and that I just have to eat right to ‘repair’ myself. She went on and on about how her friend who is strictly vegan is on her third now. I merely asked her whats her highest level of education OUT OF CURIOSITY because if she only had high school or had a learning disability I was going to go easy on her. 

Apparently that was wrong to ask, she soured and tugged Harry to leave the house. Dad is now telling me to apologize to her for being rude. Harry told him that she kept throwing tantrums about me being very arrogant and rude to her. Dad said Jess grew up in an abusive home and had a rough upbringing. As if that will explain her behavior and lack of general knowledge.

Now I do feel a teeny tiny bit bad for what I said now that I know about her troubles but she sort of hit a sore spot about telling me what to eat as if I hadn’t consulted a professional to ‘repair’ myself.

8,1djzjwu,AITA for berating my friend?,"Hello all,

BACKSTORY:

I have a good friend I've known for a long time now. We hang out somewhat regularly, text, etc. Long story short, I have a fractured and not great history with regards to dating. I haven't had a lot of success in that department. Otherwise, I have a pretty successful life. Work/career, fitness, hobbies, etc. It's all going well really. I have a lot of friends. Just no significant other.

Recently I put myself out there and started dating again after a long hiatus. I'm on hinge. My friend is the opposite of me - he's almost never been single, and he's never used online dating. He's living with a long term GF and they are even considering getting a house soon. We used to talk about relationships and women a lot, and he's basically always sort of told me to just kind of stop looking. His philosophy for me is ""stop looking, and live your life. Something will happen, if it doesn't, oh well.""

He's also teased me a bit, in jest, for being an incel (which I am not actually). Even when I do get dates, sometimes with very nice looking women, he'll tease me, saying things like ""it won't last, it never does with you."" He also has berated me for asking so many women out (most of my dating has been online...what are you supposed to do?), and has told me things like ""you lack the nuance needed to date women, you should learn from me and stop trying so hard,"" further elaborating on his success and my lack thereof.

THE SCENARIO:

I had recently gone out with a woman from hinge a few times. After date 4, I realized I didn't want to keep seeing her, and then she actually texted me the same thing. I had told him about her, reluctantly...telling him I was tired of his always giving me crap for dating. He immediately launched into his diatribe about ""dude, stop trying. You're killing it with your workouts, etc, just focus on that stuff! That, or just be gay. You'll do better with a dude, trust me."" And then he started with his usual crap, jokingly calling me an incel, cuck, etc.

I don't like being called an incel, even if it's in jest. I told him that we can't all be lucky like you, some of us have to try and date if we don't want to die alone, and that there was nothing wrong with it, and that dating doesn't mean I'm neglecting the rest of my life (which is true). I got quite angry with him, and told him I'd never tell him anything about my personal life ever again. He called me a dick, but then apologized, while still calling me overly sensitive.

I guess I'm just tired of hearing his ""advice."" And yes...it does sort of piss me off that guys like him can seemingly just not try at all. I fully admit to that being part of the triggering. 

Anyway, am I  the a-hole here?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for berating my friend? Hello all,

BACKSTORY:

I have a good friend I've known for a long time now. We hang out somewhat regularly, text, etc. Long story short, I have a fractured and not great history with regards to dating. I haven't had a lot of success in that department. Otherwise, I have a pretty successful life. Work/career, fitness, hobbies, etc. It's all going well really. I have a lot of friends. Just no significant other.

Recently I put myself out there and started dating again after a long hiatus. I'm on hinge. My friend is the opposite of me - he's almost never been single, and he's never used online dating. He's living with a long term GF and they are even considering getting a house soon. We used to talk about relationships and women a lot, and he's basically always sort of told me to just kind of stop looking. His philosophy for me is ""stop looking, and live your life. Something will happen, if it doesn't, oh well.""

He's also teased me a bit, in jest, for being an incel (which I am not actually). Even when I do get dates, sometimes with very nice looking women, he'll tease me, saying things like ""it won't last, it never does with you."" He also has berated me for asking so many women out (most of my dating has been online...what are you supposed to do?), and has told me things like ""you lack the nuance needed to date women, you should learn from me and stop trying so hard,"" further elaborating on his success and my lack thereof.

THE SCENARIO:

I had recently gone out with a woman from hinge a few times. After date 4, I realized I didn't want to keep seeing her, and then she actually texted me the same thing. I had told him about her, reluctantly...telling him I was tired of his always giving me crap for dating. He immediately launched into his diatribe about ""dude, stop trying. You're killing it with your workouts, etc, just focus on that stuff! That, or just be gay. You'll do better with a dude, trust me."" And then he started with his usual crap, jokingly calling me an incel, cuck, etc.

9,1djzetz,AITA help and debt increasing ,"I have had what I thought was a good friend since 2018. In 2020 during the pandemic work became an issue. I helped my friend start a business with loans to get started. In exchange they did projects around the house. Went okay until 2023. The need for help became constant with loans and other needs. Up until April 2023 then it blew up. They used my card for materials and needed help. The debt started growing. Throughout 2023 the debt hit over $13000. Then things crashed in January 2024, and the struggle for them got bad. I helped them through January and then April hit. The large debt purchase made in April 2023, twelve months no interest came due, and without a payment other than a minimum payment the interest was over $2600. Since April of 2023 until now they made four payments and I made 11. I started to struggle financially and for months begged for them to take control of this debt. I got a list of excuses. But no money. Two weeks ago I found that they were in a sports league playing weekend tournaments and weeknight games. Their business is slow but instead the sports was more important than the now $25000 debt. Two weeks ago they said they promised to pay and when I asked for the money this month,  the response I got was I have no money and need to make money so I can breathe. I responded that it wasn’t my debt after months of stating my limits and it was time to pay. Blew me off about it and went and played sports. I told them if I paid the bill this month then the problem would be addressed by more than just me. I could take them to court but they won’t be forced to pay, it will cost me a fortune and two attorneys said it was better that me, the teacher with teacher salary and all, file bankruptcy. I was devastated that this debt was now mine and said now everybody has to be involved. At one point last week they said fine if it will make me feel better so I did. My family knows, my friends know, everyone knows because I’m struggling financially now paying this debt and I had to ask for help. I  knew their siblings told one what was happening and my “friend” went nuts. As a response said our friendship is over and pretty much to F off. So I have to weigh my options but he was told for months I would bring in the village for the debt they wouldn’t take responsibility for. AITA for following through on what I said I would do not as revenge but out of desperation as my finances crash and I’m about to file bankruptcy after exhausting the many options, sought legal and financial advice etc. to figure out this debt. I have many forms of correspondence and promised to pay so they acknowledge the debt.  Help.

10,1djz78l,AITA for asking my stepdads cousin not to drink.,"So a few monthes ago my step dads cousin came over (ill call him D). The moment he walked in the door she (the dog) started barking (normal) and snarling (not normal). She backed away from D as far as possible and hid behind my mom.

 Normally she barks at people until they lower their hand and let her sniff it. In the 4 years we have had this dog she had never snarled at anyone or hid from anyone.

When D started drinking she was hiding and snarling even more. Whenever he went near my mom, me, or my siblings she would bark untill he backed away.

Now a few monthes later D is back over and ive requested him not to drink at our house so he can safly drive home instead of spending the night and terrifying a 4 yearold german sheapard. I was told it wasnt my place as a 17 yearold to request a fully grown adult not to drink at our house. Am i the asshole?

11,1djz4sc,AITA for threatening to spoil the next season of my roommate's favorite anime if he doesn't start paying his share of the rent?,"I live with a roommate, Dan. We split the rent 50/50. Both of us work in tech and share a love for anime. Last winter, we watched a series called Apothecary Diaries together, which Dan became deeply invested in. He bought merchandise, set his PC background to the main character, and even started planning a cosplay.

Dan was laid off in December and struggled with depression, often citing the anime as his sole source of comfort. When a second season was announced, he was ecstatic and frequently re-watched the series.

Since December, Dan has been unable to secure a new job in software engineering. He managed to pay rent up to March but asked me to cover April, promising to repay me once he found employment. April turned into May, and now June, and I have been covering his rent for three months.

I've reached my limit and told Dan he needs to pay his share and reimburse me. He argued that his full-time job search, lack of a CS degree, and the current tech hiring freeze were significant hurdles and he needed more time.

Back to the anime part. I am able to read Japanese, and Dan isn't. Since finishing the Apothecary Diaries anime in March I have read the source material (it's free online in Japanese) and am caught up to the latest chapter, so I know what will happen next season. I asked if he wanted to know, and he told me to not tell him so he won't be spoiled. 

On June 8th, we got into another argument and in the heat of the moment I threatened to spoil the next season if he didn't get a job that month. He got very upset, yelling at me and accusing me of trying to sabotage his career. I stood firm, insisting he needs to start contributing financially. This confrontation seemed to push him into action; he started doing Uber Eats the following week and began working at a fast-food restaurant on Monday. While I'm glad he's earning money again, this new job keeps him away from his computer, limiting his job applications.

Our interactions have become tense, and I can sense his resentment. Today, I caught him mouthing ""asshole"" when he thought I wasn't looking. I've covered nearly $5000 in rent for him, which I feel was more than generous. However, I do feel bad about threatening to ruin something that brought him joy and helped manage his depression.
