0,1dkfpbd,AITA for refusing to share some recipes with my SIL?,"I (34m) love to cook. It's a passion of mine. I really enjoy cooking for others and making my own recipes. Having kids with my husband (33m) made me decide to start my own recipe book so that I can better keep track of stuff our kids love lol. It's also nice to think I could share with them some day, if either loves to cook like me.

My husband's sister aka SIL (37f) and I got along really well for years. We occasionally talked cooking but other stuff was more her thing and therefore ""our thing"". Our relationship changed when my husband and I welcomed our oldest child into the family. My husband believes SIL was jealous of our daughters name because she knew it was his favorite for a girl for several years and she did not get her favorite girl name with any of her three daughters. So she took it out on me because clearly I should have said no and made sure neither of them got their favorite girl name. I can see that being true. I also think she maybe judges the fact I'm the stay at home dad, while my husband gave birth to our kids but became the working dad (he's trans, hence giving birth). Regardless, SIL has not been the same with me since and shows so much attitude! She tosses regular sarcastic comments my way, she's always slightly rude or demeaning to me now. She also insulted my cooking which she always complemented before, saying she had lied all those other times and it always made her puke afterward. I'm sick of it. We hardly ever see her anymore because of this, so much that I would consider us low contact.

The last two family dinners we had with my husbands family, I helped MIL out and did the cooking because she's dealing with some bad arthritis symptoms now. First time I made a veggie stir fry and the second time I made a chicken curry. Food went down really well. SILs kids loved the food I made and she got super frustrated because apparently they don't ever eat well for her or enjoy what she makes. She alluded to this when she asked me to share the two recipes with her. I told her no. I suggested she look up recipes she thought were similar but I told her she didn't get to be rude to me, insult me, and my cooking and then come looking for my recipes.

She called me petty, arrogant and bitchy and claimed I should ""grow the fuck up"".

1,1dk4jj7,AITA for blaming my parents for the way my sister reacted to their other daughter finding us?,"My parents were always open with me (26m) and my siblings (27m, 23m and 22f) about the fact they had another kid before us and gave them up for adoption. But our parents always said they had a son had given up and that we had a brother given up for adoption. That was something they were very clear on.

Not only did they say that but they built my sister up as their only little girl a lot. They'd make it a thing for her to be proud of, she was adored by the family, she was their special little girl, their one and only. She was our only sister and we'd all be a little extra protective of her as her older brothers.

Five months ago we found out they lied when their daughter tracked us down and said she wanted to get to know us/be a part of the family. My parents were so excited. They were hardly able to contain themselves. My sister freaked out and has refused to meet her. She brought up our parents lies and said she was never really as special as they claimed and told them she would never accept a sister and would never accept being made less special. Our parents acted so confused about her reaction. They tried reassuring her and they encouraged her to meet their daughter... it was a mess.

My brothers and I have met this new sister. I met her once and I believe it's the same for my brothers. I felt no instant connection to her and it was just all kinds of awkward. She was really disappointed she didn't get to meet all of us and she came on very strong when we met her which made the awkwardness more awkward. I think she was expecting us to be way more excited than we were and a lot more into the idea of being a family with her. The fact my sister refused to even meet her was something she mentioned 10 different times when she met us.

Apparently she still brings it up, which made my parents bring it up several times to me and to my brothers I'm guessing. The other day they were saying how upset they were that my sister refused to come to moms birthday party because they had invited our other sister. They were saying how they thought she'd handle it better and be excited. I told them it was their fault for lying our whole lives (which they admitted they did, our other sister isn't a trans woman, my parents knew she was a girl) and then hyping my sister up to be their only daughter. I told them the way they did it probably made her feel like she lost their love when it was no longer the truth in her world.

My parents told me I shouldn't blame them. They also accused me of putting my sister before them and their daughter and how clear it is whose side I'm on based on the lack of warmth to their daughter. They also said it was unfair to blame them for the actions of an adult.

2,1djzzfe,AITA not inclined to talk to my old best friend,"I was very close with someone for over 30 years. We considered each other best friends.

In our 30s, we went into business together. After a year, we brought on a third partner who provided financing. My friend was crucial in this relationship, often securing additional investment from the third partner.

The business struggled, and my friend frequently advised me on how to handle the situation to obtain more funds from the investor. These funds were important to cover some of our debts.

The relationship between me and the investor began to sour. He started speaking to me with increasing contempt and eventually gave me an ultimatum: either he or I had to leave the company. He specifically said, ""I don’t like your style.""

I found this disrespectful, considering we had worked together without issues for seven years. My friend didn't defend me. He said, ""Whatever happens, we will still be friends."" I found this odd because it implied he could decide how I would respond, whereas friendship is a mutual agreement.

I suspected my friend was okay with me leaving the business because it reduced the vulnerability around his salary, though I can't say this for sure.

I left the business gracefully that day without making any demands. I was angry and insulted but didn't retaliate.

The two continued to operate and promote the business. It didn't do exceptionally well, but they completely erased my role in its history. They framed it as if the two of them had started the business.

3,1djzwz3,AITA for removing a dashcam which recorded me without my consent,"Ok so I (24M) got a ride from my friend 22F. We were coming home from a party and she agreed to give me a ride home. The drive was pretty long and boring.

We didn't talk much but I did try to kind of flirt with her during the ride. I guess she was kinda annoyed and told me to lay it off. Cause I'm a respectful guy I decided to just stop talking.

Later I see she has a dash cam which records straight through the inside of the car. I was pretty sure it recorded our whole interaction and I was kind of embarrassed. I asked her if I could clear the memory so that our convo wouldn't be recorded. She clearly dismissed my request and said it probably wasn't recording audio anyway and that it would write over at some point.

After a but of thus I decided to just remove the dash cam from the windshield and apparently this struck a serious nerve with her. She said I broke the cable and mount and kept going off on me too. I refused to give her the camera until she showed me how to wipe it but she wouldn't.

Finally she stopped the car and told me to get out in the middle of fcking nowhere and I was forced to take an uber home. I just took the whole camera with me and decided I'd figure this all out later.

She told me I have to pay for the dashcam which is like $200 AND the SD card which is like $80 because its ""damaged"". This is outrageous cause it has to be illegal to be recording people without their consent anyway. I told her I'd give her the (unbroken) camera back but I will keep the SD card cause I need to clear it.

5,1djzmpw,AITA? Cat got locked in the bedroom and my partner is mad at me. ,"Background: Me (34F) and my partner (40M) live in an urban area 1 bedroom apartment. Bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen. Because of reasons my partner sleeps on the couch and I sleep in the bedroom.  We have 1 small dog and 2 cats. The cats aren’t allowed in the bedroom unsupervised because one of them tries to eat my clothes.  

Today I left for work around 8am. My partner didn’t have work today. And was in the living room on the couch all day watching tv, napping on and off, leaving only to smoke a cigarette and run to the deli.  I didn’t get home until 9pm today and found that one of the cats had been locked in the bedroom for an indeterminate amount of time. Possibly since I left.  

It is entirely possible and likely I accidentally shut him in there when I left. He likes to hide under the dresser.  My partner says he didn’t go in and out of the bedroom at all during the day. 

When I realized this I was shocked and a little frustrated that my partner had been here literally all day and noticed the cat was unaccounted for. But I wasn’t going off on him or anything.  However he’s reacting super defensively and making it seem like I’m a jerk for even bringing it up and being frustrated.

Truthfully I think it’s really negligent of him. The cat had no access to water , food, litter box all day.  And we’re in a heatwave. Additionally he could have hurt himself or ingested something. I don’t think it’s wrong of me to have reacted that way when my partner didn’t think to check up on any of the pets over the course of 12 hours. But he refuses to just say “I’m sorry I should have noticed I hope he’s ok” all lame defenses.

7,1djzlf0,AITA for asking a girl “what’s her highest level of education”?,"Im from the UK
I (33F) was at my dad’s birthday party the other day and we invited family and his close friends. My uncle Harry (dads brother) recently divorced from his wife to be with someone younger ‘Jess’. Mum and I are close to my aunt (harrys ex) so we have already had some dislike towards Jess. Mum actually had invited Harry alone with no plus one (aunt refused to come since he was there but their kids came) but he brought her along anyway. Jess looked super young but she said that she was ‘of age’.

Throughout the party she shocked us with a few things she said. 
1. When we were talking about travels, she said Harry brought her to France and it was her first international travel and to a European country. Crowd was stunned and she was denying that she is technically european and UK is in the european continent. She got angry and said “are u lot not up to date? We left europe ages ago” 

2. She thinks north is up
3. She never locks her car because no one can start it without her keys anyway 
4. She thinks having unprotected sex when pregnant with one baby will create twins

This is just what I can remember. Just so you know we didn’t really ask her all of this, the conversation with other ladies went over these subject matters, was hijacked by her each time and she gave us her thoughts on that so it’s not like we were picking on her incessantly. 

The part where I got irritated was when my mom’s friend was asking how my fertility treatments were going. Im on hormonal drugs to induce ovulation. Jess chimed in saying that those drugs won’t do any good and that I just have to eat right to ‘repair’ myself. She went on and on about how her friend who is strictly vegan is on her third now. I merely asked her whats her highest level of education OUT OF CURIOSITY because if she only had high school or had a learning disability I was going to go easy on her. 

Apparently that was wrong to ask, she soured and tugged Harry to leave the house. Dad is now telling me to apologize to her for being rude. Harry told him that she kept throwing tantrums about me being very arrogant and rude to her. Dad said Jess grew up in an abusive home and had a rough upbringing. As if that will explain her behavior and lack of general knowledge.

Now I do feel a teeny tiny bit bad for what I said now that I know about her troubles but she sort of hit a sore spot about telling me what to eat as if I hadn’t consulted a professional to ‘repair’ myself.

8,1djzjwu,AITA for berating my friend?,"Hello all,

BACKSTORY:

I have a good friend I've known for a long time now. We hang out somewhat regularly, text, etc. Long story short, I have a fractured and not great history with regards to dating. I haven't had a lot of success in that department. Otherwise, I have a pretty successful life. Work/career, fitness, hobbies, etc. It's all going well really. I have a lot of friends. Just no significant other.

Recently I put myself out there and started dating again after a long hiatus. I'm on hinge. My friend is the opposite of me - he's almost never been single, and he's never used online dating. He's living with a long term GF and they are even considering getting a house soon. We used to talk about relationships and women a lot, and he's basically always sort of told me to just kind of stop looking. His philosophy for me is ""stop looking, and live your life. Something will happen, if it doesn't, oh well.""

He's also teased me a bit, in jest, for being an incel (which I am not actually). Even when I do get dates, sometimes with very nice looking women, he'll tease me, saying things like ""it won't last, it never does with you."" He also has berated me for asking so many women out (most of my dating has been online...what are you supposed to do?), and has told me things like ""you lack the nuance needed to date women, you should learn from me and stop trying so hard,"" further elaborating on his success and my lack thereof.

THE SCENARIO:

I had recently gone out with a woman from hinge a few times. After date 4, I realized I didn't want to keep seeing her, and then she actually texted me the same thing.

Anyway, am I  the a-hole here?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for berating my friend? Hello all,

BACKSTORY:

I have a good friend I've known for a long time now. We hang out somewhat regularly, text, etc. Long story short, I have a fractured and not great history with regards to dating. I haven't had a lot of success in that department. Otherwise, I have a pretty successful life. Work/career, fitness, hobbies, etc. It's all going well really. I have a lot of friends. Just no significant other.

Recently I put myself out there and started dating again after a long hiatus. I'm on hinge. My friend is the opposite of me - he's almost never been single, and he's never used online dating. He's living with a long term GF and they are even considering getting a house soon. We used to talk about relationships and women a lot, and he's basically always sort of told me to just kind of stop looking. His philosophy for me is ""stop looking, and live your life. Something will happen, if it doesn't, oh well.""

He's also teased me a bit, in jest, for being an incel (which I am not actually). Even when I do get dates, sometimes with very nice looking women, he'll tease me, saying things like ""it won't last, it never does with you."" He also has berated me for asking so many women out (most of my dating has been online...what are you supposed to do?), and has told me things like ""you lack the nuance needed to date women, you should learn from me and stop trying so hard,"" further elaborating on his success and my lack thereof.

THE SCENARIO:

I had recently gone out with a woman from hinge a few times. After date 4, I realized I didn't want to keep seeing her, and then she actually texted me the same thing. I had told him about her, reluctantly...telling him I was tired of his always giving me crap for dating. He immediately launched into his diatribe about ""dude, stop trying. You're killing it with your workouts, etc, just focus on that stuff! That, or just be gay. You'll do better with a dude, trust me.""

9,1djzetz,AITA help and debt increasing ,"I have had what I thought was a good friend since 2018. In 2020 during the pandemic work became an issue. I helped my friend start a business with loans to get started. In exchange they did projects around the house. Went okay until 2023. The need for help became constant with loans and other needs. Up until April 2023 then it blew up. They used my card for materials and needed help. The debt started growing. Throughout 2023 the debt hit over $13000. Then things crashed in January 2024, and the struggle for them got bad. I helped them through January and then April hit. The large debt purchase made in April 2023, twelve months no interest came due, and without a payment other than a minimum payment the interest was over $2600. Since April of 2023 until now they made four payments and I made 11. I started to struggle financially and for months begged for them to take control of this debt. I got a list of excuses. But no money. Two weeks ago I found that they were in a sports league playing weekend tournaments and weeknight games. Their business is slow but instead the sports was more important than the now $25000 debt. Two weeks ago they said they promised to pay and when I asked for the money this month,  the response I got was I have no money and need to make money so I can breathe. I responded that it wasn’t my debt after months of stating my limits and it was time to pay. Blew me off about it and went and played sports. I told them if I paid the bill this month then the problem would be addressed by more than just me. I could take them to court but they won’t be forced to pay, it will cost me a fortune and two attorneys said it was better that me, the teacher with teacher salary and all, file bankruptcy. I was devastated that this debt was now mine and said now everybody has to be involved. At one point last week they said fine if it will make me feel better so I did. My family knows, my friends know, everyone knows because I’m struggling financially now paying this debt and I had to ask for help. I  knew their siblings told one what was happening and my “friend” went nuts. As a response said our friendship is over and pretty much to F off. So I have to weigh my options but he was told for months I would bring in the village for the debt they wouldn’t take responsibility for. AITA for following through on what I said I would do not as revenge but out of desperation as my finances crash and I’m about to file bankruptcy after exhausting the many options, sought legal and financial advice etc. to figure out this debt.

When D started drinking she was hiding and snarling even more. Whenever he went near my mom, me, or my siblings she would bark untill he backed away.

11,1djz4sc,AITA for threatening to spoil the next season of my roommate's favorite anime if he doesn't start paying his share of the rent?,"I live with a roommate, Dan. We split the rent 50/50. Both of us work in tech and share a love for anime. Last winter, we watched a series called Apothecary Diaries together, which Dan became deeply invested in. He bought merchandise, set his PC background to the main character, and even started planning a cosplay.

Dan was laid off in December and struggled with depression, often citing the anime as his sole source of comfort. When a second season was announced, he was ecstatic and frequently re-watched the series.

Since December, Dan has been unable to secure a new job in software engineering. He managed to pay rent up to March but asked me to cover April, promising to repay me once he found employment. April turned into May, and now June, and I have been covering his rent for three months.

I've reached my limit and told Dan he needs to pay his share and reimburse me. He argued that his full-time job search, lack of a CS degree, and the current tech hiring freeze were significant hurdles and he needed more time.

Back to the anime part. I am able to read Japanese, and Dan isn't. Since finishing the Apothecary Diaries anime in March I have read the source material (it's free online in Japanese) and am caught up to the latest chapter, so I know what will happen next season. I asked if he wanted to know, and he told me to not tell him so he won't be spoiled. 

On June 8th, we got into another argument and in the heat of the moment I threatened to spoil the next season if he didn't get a job that month. He got very upset, yelling at me and accusing me of trying to sabotage his career. I stood firm, insisting he needs to start contributing financially. This confrontation seemed to push him into action; he started doing Uber Eats the following week and began working at a fast-food restaurant on Monday. While I'm glad he's earning money again, this new job keeps him away from his computer, limiting his job applications.

Our interactions have become tense, and I can sense his resentment. Today, I caught him mouthing ""asshole"" when he thought I wasn't looking. I've covered nearly $5000 in rent for him, which I feel was more than generous. However, I do feel bad about threatening to ruin something that brought him joy and helped manage his depression.

Constant detention and suspension during that month. All was my fault. That's it.

Now, my dad and me don't really have a relationship. We barely talk. He either works, parties, or travels, and I just go about my business. I don't really care tbh. Now, he married a woman (dated for like idk 3 4 months?)two months ago. Idk how he even found time to hang out w her if he is so busy. Anyway, she made him go to therapy and now he's all weird. 

He is all of the sudden asking me about my school, my grades, my diet, why I don't talk much, etc. And no, he didn't know about me getting into trouble at school because whenever the school calls him he never picks up lmao. But yesterday, he dragged me to someone else's house without telling hwose it was. It was my mom's. I had not met her in years + she divorced dad when i was 10 and cut me off.

She abandoned me when i was 11 by leaving me at a KFC alone at 10 pm at night. So it wasnt fun seeing her.

Long story short  dad started blabbing about how he was a terrible dad (again, idrc bec he gives me food and a house), how i have ""trauma"" ( which isn't true). He then talks about how my grades dropped, how he found out about my school trouble encounters and he's like ""let's talk about your feelings"" which made me cringe. (He found out about me getting into trouble through emails. My stepmom read them. I found this out later).

I tell him things can just stay as it is. He keeps ranting, trying to hug me and i just didnt like the situation. Then my mom and stepmom starts talking to me about how they can ""help"" me. They then tell me i should quit smoking and start studying and try to engage with them more. It doesnt make sense. 

Why are they being too caring now? My dad started getting mad at why i wasnt listening or responding and i said i just dont really care and he just got madder because hes like ""How can you not care? Your own mother who birthed you is here too. Don't you want to talk to her? Mend things? Be our son again? Our little (my name) again?"" And on on and i just eventually left because i hated it.

Now, my dad and me don't really have a relationship. We barely talk. He either works, parties, or travels, and I just go about my business. I don't really care tbh. Now, he married a woman (dated for like idk 3 4 months?)two months ago. Idk how he even found time to hang out w her if he is so busy. Anyway, she made him go to therapy and now he's all weird. 

He is all of the sudden asking me about my school, my grades, my diet, why I don't talk much, etc. And no, he didn't know about me getting into trouble at school because whenever the school calls him he never picks up lmao. But yesterday, he dragged me to someone else's house without telling hwose it was. It was my mom's. I had not met her in years + she divorced dad when i was 10 and cut me off.

She abandoned me when i was 11 by leaving me at a KFC alone at 10 pm at night. So it wasnt fun seeing her.

Long story short  dad started blabbing about how he was a terrible dad (again, idrc bec he gives me food and a house), how i have ""trauma"" ( which isn't true). He then talks about how my grades dropped, how he found out about my school trouble encounters and he's like ""let's talk about your feelings"" which made me cringe. (He found out about me getting into trouble through emails. My stepmom read them. I found this out later).

I tell him things can just stay as it is. He keeps ranting, trying to hug me and i just didnt like the situation. Then my mom and stepmom starts talking to me about how they can ""help"" me. They then tell me i should quit smoking and start studying and try to engage with them more. It doesnt make sense. 

Why are they being too caring now? My dad started getting mad at why i wasnt listening or responding and i said i just dont really care and he just got madder because hes like ""How can you not care? Your own mother who birthed you is here too. Don't you want to talk to her? Mend things? Be our son again? Our little (my name) again?"" And on on and i just eventually left because i hated it. It felt like... i was 11 again and i hated it.  ",3.0,0.06886798143386841,0,0
18,1dkplwo,AITA for telling my stepson’s mom that the way she is treating him is affecting his mental health? ,"My stepson, 18 M, moved in with his dad and I about 4 ago. Since living here he has came out of his shell. He joined band, art, hangs out with friends, his grades improved, and he recently graduated high school.  

That being said, since he has lived with us his mother has tired to make our lives hell. Now she has moved on to tormenting her son (my stepson). Since the beginning of this year she has blown things out of proportion. 

It all started with his graduation invitations. I had 50 invitations made with his pictures on them (I also paid for them).  I had planned to send her 3 invitations, one for her, her parents, and her brother.  But it wasn’t good enough and she threw a fit about it.  I ended up sending her 5 invitations to do what she pleased with. That also so wasn’t enough. Then after that she decided she wasn’t going to come to the graduation. And she didn’t. 

Since his graduation, she has hardly talked to him. He asked her for help with his health insurance ( he is on her insurance) and she ignored him or just said figure it out. She refused to send him the card information. 

She has also told him she wants him off her phone plan and to get his stuff out of her house. An important thing to know is his mother lives 17 hours from us. His dad and I have offered to pay for a moving company and astorage unit among other things so that we could drive down when we could all get off work. But she has refused every option we have offered. 

Now, my stepson has been extremely hurt by this and asked me to talk to his mother. So I did.  I sent her a message saying that the way she is speaking and treating her son is really affecting him mentally and that I am concerned about it. She turned it into me saying she is a bad parent.

22,1dkofxf,AITA for asking my husband to stay home last weekend?,"(On a throwaway because he’s on this app.) 

My husband (m30) and I (f29) have been married for 6 years. For 5 out of those 6, he has spent every Saturday and Sunday with a group of his college friends golfing, drinking or going to car shows. 

Last week Friday, I asked him to stay home for the weekend for a date night since we haven’t had any time for ourselves as a couple since before I gave birth (we have an 5 month old). I wouldn’t necessarily say he got angry, but atmosphere in the room went from flirty to irritated; He then explained to me that he wanted to go out the next day because one of his friends was have a going away party (he is temporarily going back to his home country) and he wanted to drink with him one last time before then. He also emphasized the fact that a date night wouldn’t work out because of our daughter, but I assured him my mother wouldn’t have a problem babysitting.

Despite this, I brought up the possibility of rescheduling to the week after, but he said that he had plans (but did not elaborate). I just left it alone after that.

I think there’s some tension in the house. He hasn’t been like himself lately and has been basically avoiding me (sleeps in the guest room, rejects the advances I make on him occasionally, very short with responses, only even interacts with our baby, etc). I asked him what’s wrong the other day and he gave an obvious excuse. I don’t wanna press on but I’m feeling a lot of guilt for asking him to go out, and I suspect I’m the reason why he’s upset.

My mom supports me, since my grandmother always criticizes her, but my dad and grandmother are talking about how ungrateful, bratty, and petty I am to have yelled at her like that.

He won't discuss with me how much there is, what's its invested in and why there is now such a large gap. This only happened in recent years and I knew all about no more than three years ago.

I currently work part time and all my money goes into the joint family account for expenses. I always assumed I was going to go back to full time, well paid position but due to care needs that hasn't been possible.

He won't discuss it and says I can go back to full time but isn't willing to accept any additional responsibilities or discuss the equality indifference of me giving up so many working years. 

I am resentful and angry and feel like if I am expected to do this on my own I would be better of going towards a separation and getting what I am legally entitled too and starting over. I have consulted a lawyer and it's significant due to the circumstances. AITA??

25,1dkob4l,AITA_Taking the last of the coffee was final straw?,"My wife has a long-term childhood friend whom both have kept in touch over the years. They wanted to vacation and stay with us but history shows they expect everything but do not seem to give back anything.  When we have visited them 3 nights, we bought 2 dinners and a lunch out on the town for letting us stay.  At our place they showed up with fresh coke drinks right at lunch time and hungry.  I fed them but wondered why they didn't just call us saying they were hungry and ask us if they wanted to pick up lunch. though we already ate but it would have been nice gesture. That day I smoked ribs all day for dinner. I had a case of beer so the husband drank half of this over the next two nights.  The second night I had three burgers in the freezer so they did go buy some burger and buns the Only thing they dug deep into their pockets for the whole week. Two nights in the beer half gone they went to the store to buy a 12 pack of beer to drink himself the next two nights. They did keep saying they were going to make us dinner ""Chicken"" but why didn't they just buy some while at the store buying his beer?  That night I was cooking ""Prime"" and not cheap New York strip steaks so a fabulous dinner again. We expect little from them for letting them stay but it would have been a nice gesture if they at least added even a cheap bottle of red wine to have with the steaks to his 12 pack for himself.  This evening, they invited themselves to stay another night without even asking, lucky us!   The last night I made a delicious Asian Chicken Satay so I pulled out a nice bottle of red wine the husband enjoyed with dinner too.  Wonder why he didn’t  think of that on steak night? Add to all of this they did go to breakfast themselves and a lunch themselves on different days never inviting us. Granted we were busy with some things but could have worked around it, but there was Never the invitation. I guess this could have them being gracious to give us our free time but somehow, I feel like they didn't even want to have to buy us a couple of 2 dollar tacos which I would have suggested as a great lunch place anyway.  The wife constantly talked how they can’t afford anything the whole time here but somehow they were able to afford a 3 week vacation in our area.

Breaking point was the last morning there was 2 small cups of coffee left in pot. I came down almost following my wife's friend and she proceeded to pour a last Large cup for Herself.   She could split half with me or even her husband if he was just waking up, till I made a fresh pot, but no, she took all while I stood there in front of her!

After saving them probably 600 bucks in hotels and everything else we did AITA for thinking they should have shone even the slightest more appreciation and never wanting to host this couple again?  ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA_Taking the last of the coffee was final straw? My wife has a long-term childhood friend whom both have kept in touch over the years. They wanted to vacation and stay with us but history shows they expect everything but do not seem to give back anything.  When we have visited them 3 nights, we bought 2 dinners and a lunch out on the town for letting us stay.  At our place they showed up with fresh coke drinks right at lunch time and hungry.  I fed them but wondered why they didn't just call us saying they were hungry and ask us if they wanted to pick up lunch. though we already ate but it would have been nice gesture. That day I smoked ribs all day for dinner. I had a case of beer so the husband drank half of this over the next two nights.  The second night I had three burgers in the freezer so they did go buy some burger and buns the Only thing they dug deep into their pockets for the whole week. Two nights in the beer half gone they went to the store to buy a 12 pack of beer to drink himself the next two nights. They did keep saying they were going to make us dinner ""Chicken"" but why didn't they just buy some while at the store buying his beer?  That night I was cooking ""Prime"" and not cheap New York strip steaks so a fabulous dinner again. We expect little from them for letting them stay but it would have been a nice gesture if they at least added even a cheap bottle of red wine to have with the steaks to his 12 pack for himself.  This evening, they invited themselves to stay another night without even asking, lucky us!   The last night I made a delicious Asian Chicken Satay so I pulled out a nice bottle of red wine the husband enjoyed with dinner too.  Wonder why he didn’t  think of that on steak night? Add to all of this they did go to breakfast themselves and a lunch themselves on different days never inviting us. Granted we were busy with some things but could have worked around it, but there was Never the invitation.

26,1dknu6b,AITA for walking out on my girlfriend over a nickname?,"For context, I 24M, had an extremely close friend Ben, from my teen years. My relationship with him was complicated and i think it veered past being strictly platonic at times, Unfortunately I never really had a chance to explore my possible bisexuality, since he passed just a little over 3 years ago and I steered clear of guys ever since.

Ben had a nickname for me which is fairly common for my name, so the first time Sally called me that, I had to explain.

Sally didn't particularly like that this was 'Ben's thing', for me but accepted it anyway. Yesterday we were at a restaurant when she suddenly started calling me that. When I asked her why, she said it was time to face my fears and get over it. I told her to stop but she didn't and just kept saying it\* until I couldn't take it and walked out.

I took an uber home and I'll admit t took me a good 5-10 minutes to remember the bill but I venmoed her the cost after. Sally got home about 30 minutes after I did and was furious with me for embarrassing her and scaring her that she wouldn't be able to pay the bill all over a stupid nickname and she 'wasn't going to be second to a dead guy'.

She isn't listening to my apologies, and while I am sorry, I do think she was pushing a bit further than she had to on a sore spot, so I don't think this was entirely my fault? AITA?

27,1dknq7u,AITA for buying my sister earplugs?,"For context, my (15m) sister (6f) shows a lot of signs of having sensory issues, especially with sounds, she struggles a lot with family gatherings and birthday parties because of the noise, my family is kinda loud and on top of that blasts music really loudly, and well birthday parties for child are obviously loud cause it's mostly children.

Recently I heard her quietly sobbing in her room while I was fixing the air conditioning and when I asked her what was wrong she expressed wanting to attend her best friends bday party but at the same time not wanting to go because she doesn't like all the noise and said she felt like she was weird for feeling like that, I hugged her and told her she's not weird, I explained the concept of sensory issues the best I could to a 6yo and told her that if she wanted to go I could buy her some earplugs so she could still hear but not get overwhelmed by the noise.

We went on amazon and initially I was gonna buy her a tub of those foam earplugs but she really liked those ring earplugs thingys since they were purple, I thought they were kinda pricey but at that point in time I just wanted to make my lil sis happy, we ordered them and they arrived a few days before the party, my mom was a bit iffy about them but I previously talked to her and mentioned the conversation with my sister and she was understanding. We went to the mall to test them out since she usually hates going there cause of the noise, but she loved it, and a few days later in the party she loved the party as well.

The problem began on father's day. To make a long story short half of my family thought we were coddling her and that we should take the earplugs away and the other half thought it wasn't a big deal

Later that day I started pondering what my family said and I started to question if I should've bought them for her, at the time it felt like a no brainer but now I feel like I shouldn't have done it since she's really young and she could still grow out of it but I'm not sure

29,1dkn9kj,AITA for leaving someone out who ignored me,"A few months ago, I met up with some friends in a nearby city. One of my friends—let's call him Sam—invited a friend—let's call her Sarah—to come along. She got along with us fairly well, but I found that she was a bit unpleasant to be around. She kept trying to either correct me and the others, or educate us on stuff we already knew about.

That being said, the rest of my friends are more easygoing than me so they let it slide, and she was friendly to me and said we should hang out next time I'm in town. We also share some common interests so I didn't mind being friends. Cool.

Anyways, I noticed that there was some chemistry between Sam and Sarah when we met up. So I point it out to Sam the next day. He admits that he's into Sarah and asks for our advice. I say that he should go for it. My intention is to not only get to know Sarah (as a friend) but also sort of act as a wingman for Sam.

A few days later, I message Sarah about one of her stories. We chat back and forth several times. But then I kind of try to do the same thing I did with Sam: I bring up how when we met up, it seemed like her and Sam were sort of into each other. I mentioned how I've known Sam for a while (longer than her) and that he seemed like a really cool guy, has a lot of eclectic interests, and that they get along well. I ask if they're a thing.

She leaves me on read.

Okay, I take that as a sign that she doesn't want to talk about it and I don't message her anymore. However, I'm a sociable guy who frequently responds to his friend's stories, and I want to sort of diffuse any awkwardness, so a few days later, she posts something political to her story, I agree and have some strong thoughts about it and I tell her, hoping to open up a discussion.

Again, she leaves me on read.

Alright, maybe she's just busy. I don't message her for over a month. But she's really into music production, and a music production meme I thought she'd find funny pops up onto my Instagram feed. I send it to her.

Leaves me on read a third time.

At this point, I'm fed up with the lack of communication from her and apparent rudeness. I have a hard boundary about people who ignore someone as a way to tell them they don't like something they said and don't know how to communicate that. I unfollowed her on Instagram.

Next time I visit the same friends, I invite them but do not invite her. Once I'm in town, Sam says he's gonna invite her, but I tell him not to. I say it's because I don't want her around and that she's rude. My friends ask why and I explain what happened (aside from the wingman part because Sam is there). In response, one of my friends gives me this whole spiel about how she doesn't owe me a response and that I have no right to be rude to her, etc., and I tell him that I don't want to be friends with someone who doesn't reciprocate my attempts at being friendly.

32,1dkmdte,AITA for not explaining why i didn't invite a friend to my birthday party ,"I (18 F) turned 18 on the last saturday, and decided to make a picnic to celebrate with my friends. I invited 5 friends, but only 4 made it. 

Now for the drama, two friends of mine (let's call them Emily and Jess) were pretty close to each other, but in december Emily started bad mouthing Jess, saying she couldn't handle her around etc... Jess was clueless, but once she discovered that they stopped talking. 
While that was happening I kept being chill towards Emily, but of course it wasn't the same because of the way she treated Jess. I only saw her at school, but now that it ended she only sent me a really nice message on my birthday (really, really nice) and we said nothing more to each other. In the meanwhile i discovered she was badmouthing me too, but i didn't question her. 

When I was picking who I would invite to my party, I decided I definitely needed Jess to be there, but I didn't want a bad environment so I didn't invite Emily (even tough she invited me to her party). 

Now Emily sent me a message saying she is really sad and that I should've given her an explanation, since we weren't on bad terms and cause ""it didn't make sense to change things so suddenly"" 

I don't know what she wants to say with ""change"" bc i never made a birthday party, so i told her that and also said it was a bit mean to send me a message on my birthday just to cause a fight. 

I was explaining that to my mother and she says i should've invited her since Emily was always nice to me, I'm feeling guilty, even if I know it is my choice to invite or not invite someone, was I the asshole for not giving her an explanation?

33,1dkm99v,AITA for not taking my sister in with no strings attached and threatening to go no contact?,"My (39F) sister (36F) has always been very anxious and had a hard time with life in general. By the time we were teenagers she had dropped out of school, more or less refused to leave her room and.. has just stayed that way for 20 years. She never gained any kind of independence (never had a job, doesn’t clean up after herself, lives with our parents, rarely leaves the house).

Our mom decided that was just the way she was going to be and raised me to believe that it was my responsibility to look after her once our parents were gone. For a long time I just took that as my lot in life, but in recent years I’ve been pushing back. It doesn’t feel like either she or our parents have put any effort into getting her independent because they have me to fall back on. It doesn’t feel fair that I am expected to sacrifice my life (and finances) to care for her. I think I would feel differently if they had really tried to get her independent and it just hadn’t worked.

My sister has never been formally diagnosed with anything and refuses therapy and medication. She’s self diagnosed with anxiety and with (I feel terrible for saying this but..) whatever condition is currently in the news. It used to be ADD but now she says she is autistic. I honestly don’t think that fits (and I know plenty of awesome autistic people who have great, functional lives so it seems like a bad excuse), but it’s not my business. To be clear, we aren’t super wealthy, but she has always had full access to health care, she just doesn’t want to go.

A couple of years ago I sat them down and told them that having her move in with me should be a last resort - not their first/only option - and that I would only take her in if she gets either a job (and signs a lease) or formal disability (and they make me her official caretaker). I don’t care which option she chooses.

There was a big family row about this and I was told it was selfish to only be willing to help family with strings attached. That I should be happy to have family around and that she is a joy to live with and worth any necessary sacrifices financially or otherwise. I was also told that they were blindsided because - according to them - I was the one who decided as a young teen that I would be responsible for her (This is not how I remember it).

They have since backed off and say they accept my terms, but they have also made zero movement towards getting her therapy/a job/other living arrangements. Every time I ask about it they tell me to mind my own business.

I feel like they are calling my bluff and unless I go nuclear and cut off contact they are just going to run out the clock and leave me to deal with her once our parents are gone. I’m guessing they think I’ll cave and take her in. I can’t think of anyone else who would take her.

I love my family and I love my sister. I want to enjoy the time I have left with my parents. I don’t want to cut them off, but I’m feeling like I’m out of options here and I have to do something extreme to get them to hear me.

36,1dklvdg,AITA for not paying my roomie's rent?,"For context, my roomate M25 and myself M24 have been renting a two bedroom apartment for 5 years. Everything seemed to be going well. We would both pay our share of the rent and help eachother out a bit every now and then when needed. We both have full-time jobs and divide our chores by the days we have the most free time.

He started playing games or whatever on his phone after doing his share of after work chores.

That was okay, it was his free time, he could do whatever he wanted. Until it took over my freetime. He would start asking me to cover for his chores so he could play the game. And I did this thinking he was just a little burnt out and needed some recovery time. This went on for a couple weeks and he started playing the game more,and more,and more. He started to skip the meetups with out mutual friends, and he even started to skip his turns to go grocery shopping.

(All of that happened in the span of 5 weeks. The next part happened at the end of the fourth week of the next month)

It was time to pay rent. I paid my half to the landlord and assumed that my roommate did the same.

I got a call from my landlord a few days after. She wanted to know why she hadn't received the full payment. (4 days overdue) I immediately double checked my bank account to make sure I payed my half, sure enough I did. That only meant one thing, my roommate didn't.

That night after my roommate and myself were both off work I decided to talk to him about it. I asked him why he didn't pay rent and he said he didn't have the money... Which led to the question of whydidn't he have the money? (Mind he should have extra money considering he skipped his grocery week of the month which I told him)

His response to that was that he spent ""a little"" bit of his money on a mobile game.

Just a ""little bit"" and he couldn't afford any part of his share of the rent? And he spent in on a MOBILE GAME? I was silently praying that this was some prank, but it wasn't. He wanted me to pay his share of the rent.

I refused to do it. In the heat of the moment, I wanted him to get the consequences of his actions, forgetting that those consequences would also affect me. Even if I would have agreed, I still wouldn't have had enough money to pay full rent, especially considering I had to spend some of my extra money on the groceries he was supposed to buy that week.

He was mad, I was mad, and our landlord was even more mad. The landlord started threatening with eviction (Rightfully so. It was the third time we didn't have enough money in this year alone. Only the other times it was because of more reasonable things.)

We got the eviction notice. He moved in with some other friends and I stayed at my parent's place.

Our mutual friends are mad at me for not paying his rent. (He better be super good at whatever mobile game it is)

38,1dklubp,AITA for starting drama between my best friend and her roommate ,"How do I (25M) save my relationship with my best friend (27F) after she’s gotten  a serious GF?

I met my best friend(we’ll call her Gwen) in 2021 on bumble. We went on a “date” but she let me know she was figuring out her sexuality. We decided to keep it platonic since then and she told me she’s gay. The year we met she threw a party and invited the girl she was seeing at the time. She got into a fight with the girl and spent most of the night in her room. We were all drunk at that point and I went up to console her and ended up confessing my feelings for her(dumb of me I know). She said she wanted to stay friends. 

We still hung out regularly as we both didn’t have a lot of friends and we have so much in common. Later that year she got a serious GF and stopped hanging out with me as much. Roll around to New Years 2022. Her GF was working so I asked her if she wanted to spend New Year’s Eve with someone of my coworkers and I. She said yes, but my coworkers ended up bailing so it was just the two of us. We went to a club and danced the night away and had a great time. We used to take salsa dancing classes, so we definitely danced a lot and got a little intimate. But after that night, we went back to barely talking. It’s like she only uses me when her GF is busy to not stay lonely. 

Since she wasn’t available, I started hanging out with her two roommates more. I also slept with one of them(RM 1). I went on a trip with RM 2 and her BF/friends out of town. During this trip I asked RM 2 why Gwen doesn’t hang out with me anymore. Her roommate confessed that Gwen’s GF got mad at Gwen that she spent NYE with just me and that we salsa danced. It came across as insecure and I got mad at her GF but never said anything to Gwen. 

A couple months later, Gwen and I got drinks together. I told her that RM 2 told me that Gwen’s GF hates me and she looked so confused.  I also confessed that I slept with RM 1 one night. She told me some details about RM 2’s relationship with her BF that were confidential. At this point, we were a little drunk and took an Uber back to Gwen’s house. This is where I fucked up. I told RM 2 about what Gwen told me. That started a fight between RM 2 and Gwen. I should have just kept my mouth shut. This was a couple months ago and I haven’t talk to Gwen since then. I also haven’t talked to RM 1/2. I feel like I lost all my friends.  I don’t want to lose Gwen and I feel like her GF has gotten in the way of our friendship. Her GF seems insecure as Gwen and I have always been platonic even though I had feelings for her. 

TLDR: My best friend is gay and is in a serious relationship with a girl. Ever since there relationship started, she hasn’t been as active in our friendship. I started to hang out with her roommates but ended up saying some dumb things and now my friend isn’t talking to me.

It came across as insecure and I got mad at her GF but never said anything to Gwen. 

A couple months later, Gwen and I got drinks together. I told her that RM 2 told me that Gwen’s GF hates me and she looked so confused.  I also confessed that I slept with RM 1 one night. She told me some details about RM 2’s relationship with her BF that were confidential. At this point, we were a little drunk and took an Uber back to Gwen’s house. This is where I fucked up. I told RM 2 about what Gwen told me. That started a fight between RM 2 and Gwen. I should have just kept my mouth shut. This was a couple months ago and I haven’t talk to Gwen since then. I also haven’t talked to RM 1/2. I feel like I lost all my friends.  I don’t want to lose Gwen and I feel like her GF has gotten in the way of our friendship. Her GF seems insecure as Gwen and I have always been platonic even though I had feelings for her. 

TLDR: My best friend is gay and is in a serious relationship with a girl. Ever since there relationship started, she hasn’t been as active in our friendship. I started to hang out with her roommates but ended up saying some dumb things and now my friend isn’t talking to me.

3 months ago, me and my friend bought tickets to a concert that is on July 17th. My mother and father has never been supportive about me going to it and have unfortunate opinions about this friend because he is trans.

Now they're telling me that they want to go on our ""last family trip"" and want to leave 2 days before the concert on July 15th. They didn't tell me till yesterday and it's literally less than a month away. I asked why we can't leave a few days later and they claim it's because my mom goes back to the work the following week. (She works in education, thus as July ends she goes back to work).

My issue with all of this is that now they want me to choose between the concert and the family trip. If they really are not wanting me to go to the concert simply cause they don't agree with my friends identity, I have an issue with that. But this is making me feel horrible because now im supposed to choose between him and the concert which we've both spent 100s on and secured the tickets months ago, and if go with them I feel horrible for not going on this supposed last trip...

41,1dklh5z,AITA for insisting my son attend his softball game even tho he’s sick,"AITA for insisting my son attend his softball game even tho he’s sick

My son, 12, recently joined a rep softball team. It’s his first experience playing team sports. The coaches and organizers stressed that we need to take the commitment seriously and attend all games and practices. 

I have not, and will not EVER force my child to exert himself physically if he isn’t feeling well enough to participate. I’m thrilled he’s taken an interest in a sport I myself enjoy, but I’m not a helicopter parent at all. Joining this team was his choice and I support it enthusiastically but I’m not pushy about it. 

This week he has missed school three days and missed two games in the evenings. Tonight (Thursday) would be the third game in a row. I couldnt care less about the school, everyone is checked out at this point anyways.  

He gets chronic digestive issues that crop up from time to time, I’m going to say monthly. Upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea. It happens about once a month or so and lasts a few days. 

I’ve observed every evening this week after work that he is at home, relaxing, but I’m seeing zero symptoms other than a general sense of discomfort. No vomiting or diarrhea in my presence. 

I told him today that we would be attending his teams game tonight as spectators. I told him he needs to be there to support his team and cheer them on. I believe team sports teach youth to be a part of something bigger than them and to support one another’s success. I told him if he wasn’t feeling well enough to play that was fine, but that we needed to go to support his teammates and coaches who are out there putting in the work. 

It has been unseasonably hot in my part of the world lately, and I think of his teammates who are out there playing without a break because he’s not there to sub in for them. Again, i won’t force him to play but I insist on some face time with them so he grows into the kind of person who has those values. 

He and his mother vehemently disagree and are appalled that I’m taking this stance. AITA? ",Asshole,2024-06-20,"AITA for insisting my son attend his softball game even tho he’s sick AITA for insisting my son attend his softball game even tho he’s sick

42,1dklh4z,AITA for lashing out at my dad?,"I (28M) am a doctor. Just before my graduation, in october 2023, my mom got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. She died in january 2024. I had plans to become a psychiatrist before, but I had to move back home immediately after graduation to take care of her (my dad is also a doctor and he couldn’t do it on his own), then she passed away and I stayed home to help dad take care of stuff.
After the first few weeks, my dad stopped talking about mom. They had been married for 31 years. Then he started talking about finding a new partner and talking about this woman he likes. 
That’s okay, I know. Everyone grieves at their own pace. But my world literally stopped since mom got diagnosed, for a few reasons.
First, I loved her. We had a special relationship, since we basically had the same personality. Second, I feel so guilty about her death. I feel like I should have paid more attention to her before the diagnosis. I’m a doctor ffs, how can I not have noticed? 
Third, I completely changed my life plans. I wanted to be on my own after university, I wanted a fellowship, but mom came first, so I gave that up. I got in a school to become a General Practicioner (less time consuming) and subsequently started working as a “substitute GP” and as a “first response” (italian healthcare is complicated) doctor during nights and weekends. I don’t regret it, even though it’s not what I wanted, because my family needed me.
The point is, my mom died 5 months ago, my dad just wants to move on and I’m still heartbroken. Today’s my mom’s birthday, so it’s been extra rough. 
Tonight, dad wanted me to go to a Pizza place to watch a soccer game with his friends (including his new crush) and I said yes, but got a last minute call from a work friend that needed a favor. As a result, I was 10 minutes late and he got mad, because I hadn’t done shit all day and I still wasn’t ready (which is true, but remember that I usually work night shifts during the weekdays). I told him not to yell, since it was a crappy day for me and I was late for a work related reason. 
He didn’t even asked how I was doing. I asked him if he was okay last night, and he didn’t even bother asking “what about you”. All he cared was his soccer game with his friends. He said my mom was gone and I should just move on. 
I told him that, since he cared more about his Night out then his own son, than he could Go on his own, and so he did.
Now I feel terrible, but I’m just so tired of being the only one making adjustments for the other. All I wanted was for him to ask me how I was doing and, for a few minutes, to acknowledge that mom is dead and it sucks (yes, I yelled that, reddit, and I know it’s not fair).

43,1dklblh,WIBTA if I force my friends to cancel our camping trip?,"Myself (28F) and three friends (all in their late 20s) booked a campsite at a national park for this weekend. For context, we all love camping and have camped together before. The national park is a 3-4 hour drive from where we live. Everything fills up quickly so we booked over 2 months ago, knowing that we'd have to assess the weather and everything as the date drew closer. 

We're supposed to leave tomorrow (Friday) evening for our 2 night tenting trip. However, the weather is looking pretty bad. Different websites show slightly different conditions but overall it's calling for quite a bit of rain overnight Friday to Saturday and showers on Saturday?Sunday. Overcast the entire time with no sun, plus risk of thunderstorms. We've been waiting all week to see if the weather would improve but it's the day before the trip and things aren't looking any better. We need to decide tonight whether or not we're going so that we have time to pack and get groceries for the trip. 

I am leaning towards cancelling the trip. I struggle to rationalize driving 3–4 hours to sit in the rain for the majority of the weekend. We likely won’t be able to enjoy a bonfire, canoeing, day hikes, beach, etc. I’m afraid we’ll mostly just be trying to stay dry, which is not my idea of fun. Plus I always find that weekend trips leaving me feeling behind when I get home Sunday night so I'd really like a weekend away to be fun and worth the trouble. I think my friends are leaning towards going. They were excited to get out of the city for the weekend and say that that the weather might not be so bad. I get that weather is unpredictable, but every weather website is calling for rain every day that we're there. 

The problem is: I'm the only one with a car. It's a stick shift so none of them could drive it if I don't go. They could rent a car but it would be last minute and pretty expensive... so if I don't go, the trip is cancelled. I love camping and would love to spend a weekend in nature but I'd rather save my time and effort for a trip that I can actually enjoy. I also don't love the idea of driving 4 hours in the rain, if it comes to that.

The only money we've invested in the trip was the cost to book the site, which I could get a partial refund on. We'd each only be out around $10.

47,1dkkmmg,AITA for not playing video games with my online friends much anymore?,"Never made a post like this before so bear with me. A year and a half ago my friends all decide to play a game I have but don't invite me to play with them (they had other people play in place of me though) and never really do stuff with me for a couple months, which is fine, make some new friends that I played with while they played that game. I then got actually close with this group and enjoyed playing with them and enjoyed playing other things with my other friend group, two of my closer friends didn't like this and would bring it to my attention that they felt like they weren't as much a priority anymore. Also since February of last year I've been helping my grandparents and spending time with them since my Grandpa's in bad health, and I wanna make sure I don't regret spending too little time with him before his time with us is over.

In March, I met this girl who is now my girlfriend, we're long distance, and she didn't have a pc, and naturally as one does when they enter a relationship, I spent as much time as I could with her.

A year and a half ago my friends all decide to play a game I have but don't invite me to play with them (they had other people play in place of me though) and never really do stuff with me for a couple months, which is fine, make some new friends that I played with while they played that game. I then got actually close with this group and enjoyed playing with them and enjoyed playing other things with my other friend group, two of my closer friends didn't like this and would bring it to my attention that they felt like they weren't as much a priority anymore. Also since February of last year I've been helping my grandparents and spending time with them since my Grandpa's in bad health, and I wanna make sure I don't regret spending too little time with him before his time with us is over.

48,1dkka1w,AITA For blowing up with my parents and going no contact ,So I 25F blew up on my parents after my grandmother try to take over my son's birthday party without asking me and my father's reaction was to come over to my house and yell at me. I was not asked at all about a birthday party or anything. At the time me and my husband 30M was on our way to go to the bowling alley to see if we can't get a reservation for the birthday party. So because my father thought he could come over to my home and yell at me I snapped. After dealing with 3 years of him constantly saying I'm not his daughter because he suspected my mom of having affair. Let me remind you of this I kept my mouth shut for 3 years after he told me while I was 8 months pregnant with my son. But that's not the only thing they've done to me my father refuse to listen of my decisions he kept saying it was my husband decision and won't listen to me when I said it was mine. And after he told me that he thinks I'm not his kid everything makes sense everything he has done over the years made sense would put my sister over me would go do stuff for her but would leave me behind. It was so bad when I was in 7th grade became depressed in Middle School the principal noticed my behavior and had me talk to the counselor it was so bad that the counselor suggested I went to therapy but when school got over the first thing my mom did was scream and yelled at me saying I made her look like a bad parent not it's okay get me ice cream and take me to the therapy nope scream and yell. The reason why I got  was because I wasn't feeling love I felt like I was the unwanted child and apparently I was. It was so bad that when my sister returned from college we made a deal of splitting the chores and getting it done. Well I got my side of the chore list done but she didn't so we got screamed and yelled at for not getting the chores done but when I tried to speak up and say I got my side done I was body checked into a food pantry at 14 years old who in their right mind body checks their own child into a food pantry and tell him to shut up and won't listen to him when they try to explain. So yeah that's all I've been dealing with for my whole life but back to the main story. So yeah I got tired of being told that all my decisions was my husband's and being screaming yelled at if I even remotely got mad at something so I snapped and I went off on him because for 3 years I thought of getting a DNA test because he kept saying I wasn't his kept saying I was the milkman's baby and he was just waiting for him to return. No one said it was a joke no one said anything and then the look he got on his face after he said it was hurt it wasn't happy like it was just simply a joke it was hurt you seen in his face like he knew it was true but he didn't want to say anything so he was trying to make a joke out of it. So after he told me when I was 8 months pregnant with my son it was like he was mentally abusing me each time he said it because it hurt me because I realized he truly thought I wasn't his daughter when I look more like him than I did my own mom. So when I snap I told him I was thinking about a DNA test and restraining order because there's been more than one scenario that is causing for a restraining order first thing my mom kept trying to seduce my husband and came clean about it saying that she didn't feel loved by my father that's why she was trying to seduce him another reason why I believed his story. And then on top of that I've been told stories about her bring him into the house there was one case one dude was stuck in the dog shed in dead of winter because my dad came home early and he was thankful that my dad had a heat lamp in there and wish he didn't have the electric fence on.

This started from when we got our first cars - a $500 car for me & a 10k one for him.  Then uni accom - cheap shared accom far from uni for me, an apartment near uni for him.

He wanted to be a lawyer, but couldn’t hold a job.  Without stable employment he got a loan on a 30k car & my parents made the majority of the payments on it due to him being unemployed. I had NO car for a year.

Whilst my brother was unemployed (years) my parents paid all his living expenses.  They also paid for his barrister course - he promised to pay them back but never did - & $450 a week to rent chambers to try to make that work. Tbh I never felt bad during this time bc I figured my brother was struggling & depressed & needed help. 

Eventually he got a job that wasn't law & spent all his money on fun things - stand up paddle board, surf board, multiple guitars, big tv etc. I owned pretty much nothing ""fun"" & put all my spare money into shares, hoping to be able to save enough to buy a house. My parents often still paid things like car rego for him. 

I asked my parents if they would go guarantor on a home loan for me & they said they couldn't because my brother was financially irresponsible & if they did it for me they'd have to do it for him.  In 2021 they tried to go guarantor on a unit for him.

In 2018 I met an amazing partner, who is a doctor, and treats me like a queen. In 2023 she took a year off her training to locum around Australia (aka earn big bucks in short time) & we spent that money travelling.Also in 2023 my parents gave my brother their 1.4 mil investment property to live in for $375 a week.  A more than 50% discount.

The turning point for me in being like ""he needs more help than me, that's ok"" is when my dad told me he had given my brother 15k to spend on shares. This was during the pandemic when shares plummeted, so was really more like 30k. Needless to say I got nothing. I was very hurt, and emailed my dad asking if he could treat my brother and me equally from now on to avoid future hurt. His response to that was literally an email informing me of them giving my brother their investment property to live in. 

I brought up how hurt I am about all of this again, & my parents said they have allocated money on a needs basis. I replied that my brother has an expensive camera, virtual reality headset, playstation etc & I have almost no assets apart from an old car & things for work, & my mum replied ""it's how you choose to spend your money isn't it. You had some lovely holidays (referring to our travels last year), & your brother buys things.""

53,1dkjri6,WIBTA If I Forced An Ultimatum About Chores,"WIBTA,

A bit of backstory here,

My buddy has been living with me and my brother  (all in our mid 20s) for about 1 1/2 years, for the first 6 months he did maybe.. 5 chores total?  He slid under the radar before cuz life was kinda hectic at that point. 

But, I realized he wasn't doing anything and started to houd him about it. And it was like talking to a brick wall, but, after a few months, (after having a few sit-downs and laying everything out for him), I got him to do 1 chore a week, which, I'm still not happy with, but apparently that's all he could handle. (At this point I'm already tired of playing parent)
 And even when he does these chores, he half-asses them, to the point that if he does dishes, I know that I'm going to have to re-clean at least 3 things.  


Up to this point, I've been doing my best to be lenient because this kid didn't have strict parents and had a fucked up home life before he moved in, so I was willing to help and teach and all, 
but, admittedly I did get shitty a few times because anyone would, right? 


Now,
The past 5 weeks he has either tried to pass off simple stupid things as ""his chore this week"", has half finished a chore, or has flat out not done anything. 



So would I be the asshole if my brother and I sat down and told him 
 ""You apparently can't handle chores, so your new options are either pay us to clean up after you, hire a maid service for a few hrs a month, or get out""

I feel bad about being like that because he's otherwise an alright kid, but I'm tired of cleaning up after him when he's making next to no effort. 

Idk,

It's either this, or I sit down and give him one more shot, because I know he's trying to save money for a fairly big/important purchase. 


Tldr, 
I'm tired of the tenant that lives in my house being lazy about chores, would I be the asshole if I gave him the option of paying a maid (or me) to clean, or we're kicking him out.


I'm also open to any other ideas or advice.


(Apologies for spelling or if I type weird)


Edit: Thanks for everyone's input, y'all have solidified my suspicion that I've just been enabling this for far too long,

 I think we're gonna sit down with him and tell him this is the last chance to keep up with the amount of chores that us 2 are doing, that we're gonna give it a month to see if he can, but past that we may be looking at an eviction notice. 

If he can't get it through his head with that, I'll find another person to fill the room, and I won't feel bad for charging more 
(because srsly, we're renting it out for like.. half of what we prob should),

 I think we're gonna sit down with him and tell him this is the last chance to keep up with the amount of chores that us 2 are doing, that we're gonna give it a month to see if he can, but past that we may be looking at an eviction notice. 

If he can't get it through his head with that, I'll find another person to fill the room, and I won't feel bad for charging more 
(because srsly, we're renting it out for like.. half of what we prob should), 

and we'll absolutely add in a conversation/agreement with the next person about chores for sure, cuz I ain't going thru this again 😂",0.0,0.04089325666427612,0,1
54,1dkjiqy,AITA for telling my boyfriend he’ll have to do his own laundry? ,"I (F23) have been talking to my bf (M23) about possibly moving in together when he finishes uni next fall. Currently, I still live and work in my hometown. He has a job lined up in a town nearby, and I could definitely continue my career there.

My worry has been that, were we to move in together, household chores would be unequally distributed. I’ve dated guys before that essentially made me their mommy and expected me to keep the house clean. I vowed to never let that happen again. 

My bf isn’t bad when it comes to chores. I think the main issue is that we have different cleanliness standards. I’m pretty organized and cannot feel good in my space if it’s not clean. I truly don’t think I’m too demanding, bf is just a bit messy. If I tell him to clean, he will, and he does about 80% of the cooking. Still, most of the cleaning falls on me just because I want my space clean whereas he’s okay with letting dishes sit in the sink for a couple of days or leaving his clothes on the floor after taking them off. 

I want my space clean but I also refuse to be his overseer, so I decided that the best course of action was sitting down and explaining my demands, as well as creating a chore chart that had to be kept to. It seemed rational to deal with this now, before we actually move in together, to avoid any arguments.

So I sat him down and laid out my expectations. He was okay with them and agreed to assign each of us specific chores on specific days. No issue there. I did, however, tell him that I want each of us to do our own laundry. Each of us will get their own part of the closet, and their own laundry basket. He objected and said that adult couples living together usually share a laundry basket and do it all together.

I have multiple issues with this. First of all, I know we both go through clothes at a different pace. I like to do laundry very frequently. I also like to fold it neatly, whereas he just tosses his clothes into the closet. While I think that he will keep to the rest of the chore chart, I doubt he’d do laundry as often as I wanted him to. I like the idea more of each of us paying attention to our own clothes.

He seems a bit upset with this. He asked what will happen when we have kids, and I said that that’s when we divide up who does their laundry when, until they’re old enough to do it themselves.

I just know that if we were to do joint laundry, I’d end up doing most of it and I’m not cool with that. He’s an adult, there’s no reason for me to routinely fold his boxers. 

Now he’s saying that this arrangement would make it feel more like a roommate situation to him than a couple living together, that it’s something people do when they move in with their romantic partners. I don’t really know how to feel about this or what to think. AITA for telling my bf I want to keep our laundry separate?

EDIT: So I didn’t think I’d have to clarify this but ok. AITA has a character limit so I couldn’t explain everything in detail but let me try settle some stuff:

1. I am not “extremely clean”. I have what I see as an average standard of cleanliness, he’s just quite messy and doesn’t catch up with cleaning as much as a regular household would require it.

2. I am not dictating how things will go. We had a sit down talk where we talked as equals and came to an agreement on chores.

3. My bf doing the majority of the cooking is an example of how chores cannot be divided up equally constantly, which is normal. He enjoys cooking more than I do, so he does it. I still do almost all of the cleaning and all other aspects of the household whenever we stay at each other’s places. 

4. If you think doing the laundry is a “woman’s job”… it’s 2024, there’s something wrong with you. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for telling my boyfriend he’ll have to do his own laundry?

55,1dkjh4p,AITA for excluding my boyfriend from my grandfathers funeral?,"I 21f have been dating my boyfriend 27m for 2 months now. We haven’t had any major problems and he seems like a genuine good guy. Well at least I thought so until recently ,when my grandfather passed away of a heart attack at 90. Not super surprising considering his health and age but I was majorly upset as well as the rest of my family as he was our rock and always brought us altogether. My extended family is fairly big but we are extremely close and caring for each other. My boyfriend who lives about an hour away was supposed to come over for the weekend. I am a nurse who had just finished a 12 hour shift and then received the news of the passing of my grandpa. I shot the bf a text asking if he could come next weekend as my whole family was coming down and I wanted to be with them for emotional support over the loss.
For context my Bf never met my grandpa as our relationship is very new. He hasn’t met any of my extended family, and he has met my immediate family once.
He said no and that he was coming over, I was kind of shocked because if the roles were reversed I would have respected his space to let him grieve with his family. Anyways I went home and an hour later he showed up. He didn’t mention anything about my grandfather passing walked right into my room and sat on the bed to scroll on his phone. At this point I was pretty pissed off at how inconsiderate he was being and went about picking up clothes off my floor to stop myself from tearing him a new one. After awhile of him scrolling he says “so when’s the big event” I asked him “excuse me” he said “your grandfathers funeral when is it? I have to get new dress clothes? I told him that I was only going to go with my immediate family as he hasn’t met any of my extended and as this is a sad day for us I don’t think it’s a great time to introduce him to everyone. He immediately rolled to the side of my bed with his back to me. I asked him what he was thinking about and that’s when the irreversible damage started.
 He told me he thinks that I am embarrassed by him and his job (day trading crypto) and that’s why I won’t let him come, I was most definitely not embarrassed of him I was honestly taken aback and shocked I genuinely just want to grieve with my family over this loss and he doesn’t know any of them or my grandpa! This whole time he was still texting I asked who he was texting, “Just Lindsay” oh great his girl best friend who he has slept with multiple times before we got together and I told him made me uncomfortable! I told him to get out,he called me a not so nice name and asked why I was even sad over a 90 year old dying and what did I expect? At this point I saw red and called him some not so nice names back.

57,1dkjbq6,AITA because my roommate wants to live off campus and I want to stay?,"I (19M) and my roommate (19M) are disagreeing about our living situation for next semester. I attend a large university that requires freshmen and sophomores to stay on campus for their first two years. I should also note that I am an out-of-state resident and he is an in-state resident. (Very important)

We recently got the opportunity to break our contract and have a chance to live off-campus due to an increase in incoming freshmen. When I heard this news I wasn't too excited about it because me and my roommate had our dorm for next year set. We were going to live in a nice dorm, in a nice part of campus, with some of our friends in the building, so this contract break didn't even catch my eye. My roommate texted me and asked if I was interested in breaking the contract to try and start the search for an apartment. It is very late in the apartment searching process, so finding a decent apartment within a good price range and close to campus would be a bit challenging. He told me to just say I'm interested because it's a non-binding agreement and even if I say I'm interested nothing is solidified until we signed the contract, so I went ahead and did so.

Long story short, he managed to find a place with about a 5-minute drive off campus. The thing about this is that I won't have access to a car during my sophomore year, It's a 30-minute walk from campus, it's far from everyone that we're friends with, and it's extremely close to the cutoff point price for it to be worth it. My room and board on campus is around 14,700. This includes meal swipes, dining hall access, different places to eat on campus, a furnished room with a desk, bed, and mini fridge, etc. For a fully furnished apartment, it costs around 1,100-1,200 in rent (with some deals) and then we'd have to pay for groceries (estimated 3,200 a year), and the inconveniences of getting to and from school either with his car, the bus, or walking 30 minutes. This then exceeds the price range of 14,700 making it not worth it in my eyes.

I am by no means rich, having to take out loans and then relying on my single mom to pay for the rest. My mom really pushed me to go to this university and I can't seem to find a decent reason to rush the process of getting an apartment. She also thinks moving off campus into an apartment Is a waste of money this year because we have a good dorm with people we know in our building. My roommate argued the case that getting an apartment would be cheaper for him and his family. But considering I'm an out-of-state resident I am already paying more than him regardless, as selfish as that sounds. My roommate and I became really good friends so I'd hate for us to split up because we want two different things that would benefit us financially. So AITA?

TLDR: My roommate and I are disagreeing on where to live next semester and I can't find a great reason to stay off campus.

59,1dkj6gk,AITA for not inviting my high school friend to my civil wedding ceremony?,"Apologies in advance for the long story.

I (26m) have a friend (also 26m) that I've been somewhat good friends with since grade 10. We met in grade 10 but we didn't hangout a whole lot during high school years (maybe once a week at most). When we graduated HS we drifted apart for a few years. About 2 years ago we started talking again and became closer as friends.

Moving on to the wedding situation. My wife and I just got married and as we were planning the wedding, we considered a lot of different options and different ways to celebrate/do the ceremony. Unfortunately renting a big venue that would be able to host all the people we know (60+ people that are friends and family) was unaffordable for us. So, because of financial reasons we decided to split our wedding into 2 events:

Event 1 - We invited our families and 4 very close friends (2 from each side) to a small venue (for about 2 hours) for a civil ceremony and then we rented out a room in a restaurant for dinner. Keep in mind, the 4 friends that we invited have been our best friends for over 15 years now, so we consider them to be our family at this point. The ceremony venue and the restaurant had a maximum 30-person capacity. We had 31 people including the photographer, so all seats were full unless we wanted to pay an additional fee in both places to seat more people (which would be expensive).

Event 2 - A week after our civil ceremony, we rented out a few cabins at a lake nearby for all our friends (19 friends ended up coming) for the whole weekend, to make sure we can properly celebrate with everyone that weren't included in the first event. Plus, we thought it would be more fun to have just a ""friends"" celebration, so our families won't judge our choice of music and alcohol consumption, lol.

So, a few weeks before the civil ceremony my high school friend started making comments about how he's not invited to our wedding, even though I explained everything to him and told him that the 2nd event was for our friends and that's when we will celebrate together. Every time we talked about it, he told me he understood why we did what we did, and he was ok with it, but then he would go back to making these passive aggressive comments about not being invited to the ceremony. 

As planned, a week after the civil ceremony, we all went to the cabins. We decided to do a mock ceremony for all our friends at the cabins to make it as much of a ""wedding experience"" for everyone as we could. Right before we did the mock ceremony, he said out loud ""I hope this will be better than the other ceremony, because I wasn't even invited for that"". 

All the other friends that weren't at the civil ceremony completely understood why we did these 2 events separately and supported us. No one made any comments about ""not being invited to the civil ceremony"" except for him. 

AITA for not inviting him to the civil ceremony?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for not inviting my high school friend to my civil wedding ceremony? Apologies in advance for the long story.

I (26m) have a friend (also 26m) that I've been somewhat good friends with since grade 10. We met in grade 10 but we didn't hangout a whole lot during high school years (maybe once a week at most). When we graduated HS we drifted apart for a few years. About 2 years ago we started talking again and became closer as friends.

Moving on to the wedding situation. My wife and I just got married and as we were planning the wedding, we considered a lot of different options and different ways to celebrate/do the ceremony. Unfortunately renting a big venue that would be able to host all the people we know (60+ people that are friends and family) was unaffordable for us. So, because of financial reasons we decided to split our wedding into 2 events:

Event 1 - We invited our families and 4 very close friends (2 from each side) to a small venue (for about 2 hours) for a civil ceremony and then we rented out a room in a restaurant for dinner. Keep in mind, the 4 friends that we invited have been our best friends for over 15 years now, so we consider them to be our family at this point. The ceremony venue and the restaurant had a maximum 30-person capacity. We had 31 people including the photographer, so all seats were full unless we wanted to pay an additional fee in both places to seat more people (which would be expensive).

Event 2 - A week after our civil ceremony, we rented out a few cabins at a lake nearby for all our friends (19 friends ended up coming) for the whole weekend, to make sure we can properly celebrate with everyone that weren't included in the first event. Plus, we thought it would be more fun to have just a ""friends"" celebration, so our families won't judge our choice of music and alcohol consumption, lol.

So, a few weeks before the civil ceremony my high school friend started making comments about how he's not invited to our wedding, even though I explained everything to him and told him that the 2nd event was for our friends and that's when we will celebrate together. Every time we talked about it, he told me he understood why we did what we did, and he was ok with it, but then he would go back to making these passive aggressive comments about not being invited to the ceremony. 

As planned, a week after the civil ceremony, we all went to the cabins. We decided to do a mock ceremony for all our friends at the cabins to make it as much of a ""wedding experience"" for everyone as we could. Right before we did the mock ceremony, he said out loud ""I hope this will be better than the other ceremony, because I wasn't even invited for that"".

60,1dkj4ib,AITA for asking my family to not  speak to me about my dead dad on my wedding day? ,"Some backstory, My (26f) dad passed away last year very suddenly. I hadn't spoken to my dad for two years when he died, as he was an addict and when he was high he had tendencies that were very traumatic and scary. I distanced myself from him, but kept in touch with my grandfather, aunt, and cousins. Occasionally my aunt and cousins would be curious about why I didn't speak to my dad, but I felt it wasn't their business and I didn't want to cry while spending time with them, so they didn't know exactly what my dad had put me through. Which is where I might be the asshole in this story...


Anyways I am getting married this summer and my dad's side of the family were all invited. I was talking to my therapist about being nervous about my dad being brought up at the wedding and the possibility of being asked why I didn't honor him with a memorial and having to explain myself and possibly being hit with a huge flood of emotions about my dad on an already emotionally charged day. So, I was like ... what if i just asked my immediate family + my dads side of the family not to bring my dad up to me just for the day of my wedding. My therapist supported it, so I got to typing in the notes app the draft. 


I started off talking to my mom, and my siblings. They all supported me. I then sent the same text privately to my aunt, and my cousin, and was about to send it to my other cousin and grandfather, when I got responses from both of my aunt and cousin. They took my message as hateful, singling them out, pointless, and calling them children essentially.


My cousins text hurt the most as they said ""I feel truly sorry you felt the need to send it because it truly shows how much hatred you have in your heart"" ""You can take me off your RSVP"" ""Grandmother (also passed) would be so disappointed in you, honor him (my dad) for her"" 
This text is probably the most disrespectful text I have ever been sent my 26 years of living... I immediately called my mom and siblings crying. After an hour or two, this sadness turned to rage. I couldn't believe my cousin had the nerve to even press send without even knowing what my dad put me and my family through. 


I took screenshots of the private texts I had been sent, messaged the family group chat with everyone on my dad's side in it, and blasted the disrespectful texts. I went into extreme detail why I didn't want my dad spoken about to me for four hours on my wedding day, explaining all that my dad had put me through, and that now my aunt and cousin were uninvited in front of everyone. My cousin responded, ""How were we suppose to know what he put you through?"" with her backtracking her text along with my aunt. Neither her or my aunt gave good apologies so they are still both uninvited BUT, with them not knowing what my dad had put me through, did that make my request ridiculous and unnecessary? AITA?

63,1dkhyzx,AITA for not spending time with my parents on last school day and staying for too long?,"I (16M) went with my parents to my school's graduation day. I wanted to spend as much time as possible with my class before we all move on to different upper secondary schools.

After the ceremony, my parents wanted to take pictures. They know I don't like pictures, they already recorded me at the ceremony, the whole class had taken a picture together already, and it'd be awkward to take pictures as the weird kid in the middle of a crowded schoolyard, so... I proceeded to say ""no"" and ran away from them with my best friend (which was funny to us, probably not to them.) Then I yelled behind me, ""Later!"" We went inside to find our other classmates.

I prioritized my classmates and favorite teachers over my parents. Most of the students didn't even know where their parents were half the time, and the adults spoke mostly to each other, so I didn't think much of it. My parents called me several times asking when I wanted to go home, and I'd ask to stay longer because I had grown attached to these people, especially since I had a class that got along well and was surprisingly nice towards my anxiety-filled ass.

Finally when I had finished saying goodbye to everyone, I found my parents at the entrance. They said they had been waiting for me for a while and that we couldn't take a picture now because they were tired and we needed to go home. I told them, ""I don't care about the picture."" That sounded rude so I re-formulated it and meant that it was alright, and we could just go home now if they wanted to. I didn't expect that my mom would take the whole thing so personally. 

In the car, she went on a long angry lecture about how I always disrespect my elders, that she's gonna kick me out as soon as I turn 18, and I should be glad that it's not legal to hit children here. She and dad were tired, they wanted to go home earlier but I didn't know, because I was busy with other people “... that you can meet again in the future. If you're gonna say ‘this is the final time I meet my friends,’ unfriend them!”

I admittedly talked back a few times, trying to explain why meeting most of them again is unlikely but my mom didn't want an explanation and kept ranting. Then my dad told me to be quiet and told my mom it's enough again and again but she kept going until his voice cracked.

When we came home, my dad got me to say sorry to her, to which she responded with skepticism and immediately dismissed me. 30 minutes later, she was chill and talking about my grades with me as if nothing had happened. I was left very confused. 

I realize now that graduation day is also important for parents too, and I should’ve involved them more despite no one else doing so with theirs. AITA? My dad and I bought flowers for her the next day as an extra apology. 

TL;DR: Was with classmates and teachers last school day, saved taking pictures with my parents for later, tired out my parents by staying at school too long, barely interacted with them, was yelled at in the car.

64,1dkhq6t,AITA for tossing out some cakes that my wife baked?,"I (38M) was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about 2 months ago. It's completely self inflicted because of my lifestyle and weight,  and I completely acknowledge that. Since then though, I've been working hard to try and drop weight and make healthier choices, and I've started to make positive steps in that direction.

For me though, food is like an addiction, i don't want to compare it to more hardcore addictions like drugs or alcohol,  but I am constantly wanting to eat junk and treat food (which is how I got into this mess in the first place). I'm not going cold turkey on those foods (as I feel that's equally unrealistic), but I'm doing much better. My main strategy is trying not to buy it at all. Enter my wife.

She is not at all supportive in terms of trying to enable the healthy choices I'm trying to make. For example, she will continue to bring crisps and chocolate into the house in large amounts,  even though I ask her not to. I don't want her to flat out stop,  but it's an excessive amount. I know that the problem is mine and not hers, but it doesn't make it easier to have all this food temptation so close by.

She is also an amazing Baker - she will frequently try new recipies from TikTok and they are almost always incredible. Again though, I've asked her to maybe not make it all the time (like currently 2-3 times a week), but she's still doing it so frequently. 

Last night she made a tray bake of flapjacks, which are my absolute favourite. I had one, and not polishing off the tray required a huge mental effort from me (which I know, again is my fault).

This morning after she left for work (I work from home), I took the tray directly out to the bin and dumped the lot of them. It was a total impulse, and I felt bad about it, but I also sort of felt like a pressure had been lifted. When she came home, she was absolutely furious, but I tried to make my case and explain how hard it was to stop eating junk food after doing it for so long, and that I'd appreciate a little more support.

I was very happy for him and got to know that my dad very specifically promised him to buy OnePlus 12, the flagship phone of OnePlus released this year, if he scored above 95, which he did.

It is to be noted that while my brother has had access to smartphones he has never had one of his own, instead having a tablet. I was a little miffed that my inputs weren't sought for this proposed purchase. Nevertheless, at the same time I wanted him to have a reward for his no-less-than-stellar efforts, and I asked him for the specifics of the phone.

My brother wanted the model with 16GB RAM and 512GB of storage and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. This was costing us \~840 USD (70,000 INR). I let him know that those specifications were insane and totally over and above his requirements. Instead I suggested the OnePlus 12R, a lower but similar model that costed us almost half \~490 USD (41,000 INR) after a discount. 

The model I suggested had 8GB RAM and 256GB storage (that could be extended in future if needed) and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset.   
(Sorry for getting technical, this is important though)

I explained to him and to my dad, that the chipset and RAM difference would not be so significant as to impede his day-to-day usage and requirements. But my brother was disappointed even after I explained this to him multiple times. My dad agreed with me and bought him the lesser priced one. 

Now, my brother uses his smartphone for voice calls (sometimes video), for streaming Netflix, and for light gaming. He plays a driving game, Minecraft and Hill Climb Racing. Sometimes he studies notes his teachers send and chats with his friends. 

According to me, none of this has been affected by the phone model we bought. And over the next couple of years, with his college apps kicking in, his smartphone use will tend to be more lighter than it is now. 

Today, he accused me of not letting him buy things he liked, and that I never let him have fun.

66,1dkhkm3,AITA for not having an opinion ,"I (34F) and my ex (35M) had a fight. About a year ago my boyfriend of 18 years and I broke up as we decided we had grown apart and are not good together as a couple. We still live together cause neither one of us could afford to move. Now he is looking at houses and is planning on moving by the end of the year, while I am finishing some certification courses so I can afford to live on my own.

Today, he saw a house and took pictures and videos to show me and asked for my opinion. I felt really uncomfortable giving an opinion as it really doesn't pertain to me and I kept trying to steer the conversation away from what I thought about the place.

A little back story, I am a very forward and frank person. If you ask for my opinion I will tell you what I think, if I agree etc etc. I don't mean to be mean but I am honest and frank and I don't walk around a point. One of the reasons we separated was our communication. He felt as though I was attacking him everytime we spoke and I felt like everything I said he would get offended at. I try to be more mindful but I'm a smart-ass so I've been trying to avoid giving my opinions when I know it will just upset him.

He kept insisting he wanted to know what I thought about the house cause he said that he values my opinion. So I began to say ""OK, but you're not going to like what I have to say. And I don't really have an opinion since this won't be my home."" 

Before I could finish the above two sentences, he got very upset and started making some comments about ""it doesn't apply to you so you don't give a shit.""  And he became visibly upset.

This isn't what I was meaning to say or the point that I was trying to get to. I started to mention ""hey if you could just let me finish a thought I'll tell you what I think"" He snapped back at me and made it clear that no matter what I said I would once again upset him more.

And I told him not that it matters but you should really let people finish a sentence before you get pissed off at them."" Am I the asshole for not giving my opinion?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for not having an opinion  I (34F) and my ex (35M) had a fight. About a year ago my boyfriend of 18 years and I broke up as we decided we had grown apart and are not good together as a couple. We still live together cause neither one of us could afford to move. Now he is looking at houses and is planning on moving by the end of the year, while I am finishing some certification courses so I can afford to live on my own.

Today, he saw a house and took pictures and videos to show me and asked for my opinion. I felt really uncomfortable giving an opinion as it really doesn't pertain to me and I kept trying to steer the conversation away from what I thought about the place.

A little back story, I am a very forward and frank person. If you ask for my opinion I will tell you what I think, if I agree etc etc. I don't mean to be mean but I am honest and frank and I don't walk around a point. One of the reasons we separated was our communication. He felt as though I was attacking him everytime we spoke and I felt like everything I said he would get offended at. I try to be more mindful but I'm a smart-ass so I've been trying to avoid giving my opinions when I know it will just upset him.

He kept insisting he wanted to know what I thought about the house cause he said that he values my opinion. So I began to say ""OK, but you're not going to like what I have to say. And I don't really have an opinion since this won't be my home."" 

Before I could finish the above two sentences, he got very upset and started making some comments about ""it doesn't apply to you so you don't give a shit.""  And he became visibly upset.

This isn't what I was meaning to say or the point that I was trying to get to. I started to mention ""hey if you could just let me finish a thought I'll tell you what I think"" He snapped back at me and made it clear that no matter what I said I would once again upset him more. I ended up telling him, ""never mind it wasn't worth getting into an argument over this. And I told him not that it matters but you should really let people finish a sentence before you get pissed off at them."" Am I the asshole for not giving my opinion?",0.0,0.07041102647781372,0,1
67,1dkhjt3,AITA Not giving up the bed for my ex while maintaining rent sharing,"I (M24) was recently dumped by my ex (F23), not mutual on my end but we both knew there were problems. Currently sharing a studio with my childhood bed (Queen) and a pullout couch (Twin) until she moves out in August, and she initially posed that since we were still sharing rent & utilities, we could take turns between the couch and the bed. Given that the situation wasn't initiated by me and we have under a month to go, I said I would not be relegated to the couch out of my own bed, but that I wouldn't care if she decided to either sleep in the bed or on the couch and I would maintain boundaries regardless to continue the breakup amicably. For the first few days, she continued to choose to sleep on the couch and we attempted to be amicable during the day, but she has since left to stay at mutual friends' places, with her mom, going on trips out of town, etc. We are currently in No Contact w/ minor texting for logistical situations, so it's difficult to parse out when she may return or use the apartment again (other than moving things out in August).

Additionally, she is written onto the lease through July, so we have continued to split rent (\~$1700 a month) and utilities (\~$150-190 total) as agreed to (we have done this at all of our living arrangements since we were not married). Despite this, I can't help but feel weird about the arrangement, especially given that she is not really in the apartment that often. I very much was financially planning to split through July, but I also feel guilty about it, especially since she makes a little more than half my salary.

Definitely want to be the bigger person here, so I want to get some perspective on whether I am in the right or wrong under both of these circumstances: 1) not sharing the bed completely, and 2) maintaining rent sharing when she is not here.

She had a lovely dark chocolate cherry cake. It was my favorite thing that she would make and I always requested it for Father's Day. I am a shit baker and I have tried to remake it from her notes. The notes are not very clear and it never turns out correct. It is depressing spending so much time and it being wrong.

I have asked my two kids to try and make it but they have refused to. I was told that they will not figure out the recipie and to stop asking. I went to a local bakery and asked for them to figure it out.

They agree as long as I gave them the permission to sell the cake in the store. It didn't take them long to figure it out and it is almost exactly the same to my wife's.


I bought one for Father's Day and my kids were happy about the cake until I told them the bakery did it. They are pissed I would sell their mothers recipie to a bakery. 

This whole week they have been telling me how I am a jerk for this and I am wondering if I really am a jerk. I just wanted to eat her cake again

69,1dkgtls,AITA for trying to save my mom’s house,"So 20 years ago my brother Steve bought out my mom’s house to save it from going back to the bank. I understand that it would be Steves house after that. My mom lived there until she died. After Steve’s oldest daughter moved in rent free and has lived there. 

Steve died about two weeks ago and his two children have been arguing about my mom’s home. They discussed it with Steve’s estate lawyers and the spoiled girls agree to sell it and split the money. I wanted to preserve our family home and buy it from it but I was sticker shocked at the 1.5 million price tag. I asked my niece about it and she sent me to the estate lawyer. I was going to do a rent to own agreement and made it up. I thought it was a steep price tag but he the showed me market rates for houses in the area and told me no the plan I showed him doesn’t work. That my brother wanted his daughter’s taken care of. I told the lawyer that my mom would be disgusted that this is happening. He told me the probated period of my mom’s estate ended years ago and I can make a request against my brother’s estate but my brother’s will is set 50/50 with his daughters and they have entered an agreement to sell the house. 

I’m disgusted at my nieces for profiting so much off their grandmother's and father’s deaths. I didn't realize when Steve bought out my mom’s house almost 20 years ago it would go down like this and I feel like me and the rest of my family are squeezed out. I told the lawyer I will get one as soon as I save up the money and he said “he’s sorry but that's not how this works, he works for my brother’s estate and he cannot wait around for me to afford a lawyer to make a claim on the estate. He was a smug asshole and my niece blocked me. 
My husband and children think I’m right and I want to fight this sale. I put it on Facebook but no one has any advice other to get a lawyer and the ones I talk to act like it's beneath them to help me and my nieces refuse to speak to me and tell me to go through the estate lawyer.

70,1dkgmjl,AITA for ghosting my bf because he owes me money?,"my boyfriend has owed me £370 for about 6 months. two weeks ago he paid back £200 of it, but still owes me. 

it might not seem like a lot, but i don’t work full time and for our age, that is a decent amount, especially to owe your gf. i also like going out, and having to pay for travel, substances, food and whatnot adds up.

basically, we were best friends for a year until he confessed and we started dating. he’s quite a bad influence and we do a lot of drvgs together, which is where a lot of his debt has built up from. the money i lend him comes from stupid shit- he once refused to buy a train ticket when we went out, we got to our destination and there were closed gates. i told him to run through them when i scanned my ticket, its not like they’d chase us down, but he refused and said he’d pay for a child’s ticket (£10, that’s all he had on him). i told him not to, because they’d fine him for not buying a ticket beforehand, he didn’t listen. we go over to the guy, he tries to buy a ticket, and surprise surprise they fine him. they ask him how old he is, he says “we’re both 17”. then they ask to see my ticket, which is a child, so i get fined too and end up having to pay £80 all because he doesn’t ever listen. he’ll ask if i wanna split substances with him, we go to pick it up and he’s like “oh, i have no money, can you cover me and i’ll pay u back tomorrow?”

a couple months ago, he dipped into his savings and bought a motorbike. i was so angry, and over texts he was listing all the things he had to pay for which is why he couldn’t pay me, like insurance, helmet, whatever. am i crazy or is that so disrespectful? if you’re in debt, you pay it back before you buy anything else. 

he does have income. he recently got fired from his job, but before that he was making around £200 a month. he walks dogs for £10/hour, and does other practical jobs and gets paid in cash upfront. he also dropped out of college, so it’s not like he doesn’t have all the time in the world to be making money.

it is my fault for continuing to lend him money, i know that, but here’s where the current problem started.

we went to pick something up from his dealer. it cost £30, he was supposed to bring £10 and i was bringing £20. i had an extra £20 in my phone case because i always do. anyway, the dealer shows up, and once again, he has no money and i have to cover him. so bf asks the dealer if he has £10 change, he says yes and i pay him with the two twenties. then my bf asks for the change, and the dealer says no, he’s keeping it because my bf owes him £60 already. so now im pissed, but he promises he’s doing a job tomorrow and can pay me back, so i share the stuff with him. 

guess what? he didn’t pay me back. then yesterday, he bought a gram of weed. i got mad at him, he promised to pay it back, blah blah blah, then today he bought ANOTHER GRAM. his excuse is that he “needs” it, like he’s a crack addict or some shit. so i ghosted him. 

now i feel guilty, like it isn’t that big of a deal, but i really want that money back, and i think it’s so, so rude how he continues to buy weed in front of me when he’s owed me for so long. not to mention that i’ve been so nice about it, and the stuff he owes me for is stuff i bought him because i care about him. im not a hardcore ghosted anymore, but there’s not even any point in fighting with him because he just says sorry and promises to pay it back. what else can i do?

idk, maybe im TA but i don’t plan on talking to him until he pays me back the £20 from the other day that his dealer took- which i think is generous, considering he owes me a LOT MORE. our group is supposed to be going to a music event on saturday, and i hope he has fun staying sober because fuck off am i paying for his shit again.",TL;DR,2024-06-20,"AITA for ghosting my bf because he owes me money? my boyfriend has owed me £370 for about 6 months. two weeks ago he paid back £200 of it, but still owes me.

72,1dkgexi,AITA for telling my mom if she didn’t want kids then she’s not getting a huge Mother’s Day celebration? ,"Growing up, my dad stayed at home while my mom worked. While my mom financially provided for my sister and myself, she was emotionally hands off. She came to a ballet recital here and there but didn’t want to help with homework, didn’t want to listen when we needed advice, etc. Our dad did 95% of the emotional labor. I later found out from my mom that my dad was the one who wanted kids. She loved her career and didn’t mind providing financially but she did not want to do any of the stuff related to raising us outside of that. I am very grateful she provided for us financially, but I do admit it hurts that she wasn’t there when we needed her. She was physically present but not emotionally present.

EDIT: as this has come up, to be clear, the arrangement was my mother’s idea, not my father’s. That being said, I do agree that my father was equally as selfish for making this arrangement. 

My dad always did grand gestures for her. Mother’s Day was always a big deal with a huge brunch, flowers, gifts. She was spoiled. She did nothing for him on Father’s Day. He had to do everything for himself until my sister and I were old enough to do stuff for him. I get that was the arrangement they had but I know it made my dad sad. I once asked why he didn’t get the same hoopla our mom got and he just sadly said “father’s day isn’t as important as Mother’s Day.”

As adults, my sister and I have tried to rectify it. We do Father’s Day up big and our dad loves it. We grill for him just how he taught us and throw a huge BBQ with some other family members. However, we’ve turned Mother’s Day very lowkey. We still celebrate our mom but she usually gets a quiet lunch at a restaurant of her choice and a few gifts. After my mom ended up skipping my sister’s baby shower this year because “she didn’t see the big deal with someone having a baby”, my sister wanted to do nothing for her. We sent gifts but spent Mother’s Day with each other, our husbands and our own kids. 

My mom told us after Father’s Day that she was hurt we didn’t do more for her in recent years. I said that since she put in almost no emotional labor into raising us, we are putting none into her. She said that our father and I had an agreement. I pointed out that yes, but we never agreed to it and it want fair that we grew up with an emotionally absent mother who didn’t want us.  And to be fair, we have had this conversation with our dad as well and he admits it wasn’t fair to us either. I also said if she didn’t want kids, then why should she be celebrated as a mom?

My mom is upset with both of us and called us ungrateful brats. My dad feels bad for her but supports our choice. AITA? 


EDIT: To those asking how I’d feel if my dad were the one that acted like this/how I feel about dads who do this in general: they suck just as much and it’s not fair to the kids, regardless of whatever agreement spouses come to.

73,1dkgccj,AITA for switching plans with my bf twice in a row because I'm forgetful and stressed?,"Hi all. So, my bf (22M) and I (23F) have been dating for 1 yr + 4 months. We met in college and now we're \~4 hrs long distance, so we try to see each other 1-2 times/month.

There's been tension recently b/c, before starting his job, he was not working at all, so he has been financially dependent on me. I've been paying for all costs to see each other for the past 6 months. I voiced disappointment about this to him, + told him that I don't feel like he cares or puts in as much effort as I do. He took it to heart + wants to be better now that he has the ability to do so. Since he just started his job, he wants to plan a weekend for us so he could ""treat me right.""

4 days ago, I had to bring my mentally ill mother (bipolar psychosis) to the ER where she was later admitted. I talked to my bf about this + how stressed I was, + he was initially supportive.

Initially, I told him I could see him next weekend, forgetting that I have plans to attend a Pride party + parade with friends. Earlier in our relationship, this wouldn't have been a problem (b/c I could have invited him), but I feel like I can't b/c there's an awkward vibe btwn him + my friends. Months ago, I told my friends about how he would sometimes get irrationally mad + wouldn't communicate. They've only hung out with him twice, but whenever I mention him now, they’re weird b/c of what I told them. So inviting him isn't an option.

While dealing with everything with my mom, I offered the next weekend as an alternative, again forgetting that I have to attend a surprise party that weekend.

He proceeded to ignore me for the \*entire\* day. That same day, my mom was readmitted to the hospital, but I didn't tell him b/c he was ignoring me.

We finally talked the next day and I was angry. I think it's so inappropriate to ignore me, especially when I'm trying to show love + when he knows I have a lot going on.

",Asshole,2024-06-20,"AITA for switching plans with my bf twice in a row because I'm forgetful and stressed? Hi all. So, my bf (22M) and I (23F) have been dating for 1 yr + 4 months. We met in college and now we're \~4 hrs long distance, so we try to see each other 1-2 times/month.

There's been tension recently b/c, before starting his job, he was not working at all, so he has been financially dependent on me. I've been paying for all costs to see each other for the past 6 months. I voiced disappointment about this to him, + told him that I don't feel like he cares or puts in as much effort as I do. He took it to heart + wants to be better now that he has the ability to do so. Since he just started his job, he wants to plan a weekend for us so he could ""treat me right.""

4 days ago, I had to bring my mentally ill mother (bipolar psychosis) to the ER where she was later admitted. I talked to my bf about this + how stressed I was, + he was initially supportive.

Initially, I told him I could see him next weekend, forgetting that I have plans to attend a Pride party + parade with friends. Earlier in our relationship, this wouldn't have been a problem (b/c I could have invited him), but I feel like I can't b/c there's an awkward vibe btwn him + my friends. Months ago, I told my friends about how he would sometimes get irrationally mad + wouldn't communicate. They've only hung out with him twice, but whenever I mention him now, they’re weird b/c of what I told them. So inviting him isn't an option.

74,1dkg9t7,AITA for helping my BILs wife with advice on how to agree on baby names?,"My husband's brother and his wife are expecting a baby together. This is their first. My husband and I have four kids so we've been there, done that and we're both happy with our kids names. For the sake of the post BILs wife is going to be Emma.

So Emma came to me a few weeks ago and asked me how my husband and I figured out names for our kids because she and BIL haven't listed the name name yet for their baby. She said they've made a few lists already but there's never one name overlapping. She said given we seemed to find our names easily and we're still happy, she felt I was a good person to ask.

I decided to help her without going into ""name your baby this"" or ""use this to get a baby name"" and instead I told her some steps my husband and I took. 1) Write a list of top names, top 10, 20, 50 whatever and choose the names off each other's list that are absolutely no, never going to happen and accept that and don't hold a grudge over it 2) Discuss what your priority is in a name. For us it was a name that fit among peers (not too old, not too weird) but where they would still be the only \[name\] in the class. 3) Try to have fun with it both individually and together 4) Take breaks if you feel yourself getting stressed or frustrated.

Emma took it all in and even made some notes on her phone while we talked. She thanked me for the words of wisdom. Then she went to BIL and all seemed fine. Until he found out I had given advice. He told me I had no business interfering and told my husband I should mind my business. My husband stood up for me and said Emma had asked and I didn't interfere, I didn't try to talk them into a name, I just gave some tips on how they could work together better.

Emma apologized to me for BIL getting so angry. BIL said I should at least apologize before we put this to bed. He said I did overstep with my advice. My husband said BIL is being unreasonable.

75,1dkg4q2,AITA for threatening to tell my landlord that my roommate has been making huge changes to the house without asking their permission?,"UPDATE: thank you everyone for your opinions and advice. I never really thought about the legal aspects of it mainly because my name wasn’t on the lease. On my lunch break I called my landlord and told them that my roommate was taking out the lights in the living room space and going to put in new ones. I said it looks like he was messing with wires and I saw some wires laying on the table that looked like they had been cut out. I said that I was telling him this because I felt like he should know and I wanted to do the right thing. I also told him that I had told my roommate that he really needed to ask permission first but he just blew it off and said that the landlord would like the changes since it makes the house “better”. I planned on moving out in a month but I don’t mind moving out sooner which I had also told our landlord. I thanked him for letting me live there for the past year and he thanked me for letting him know what was going on and that he’d be stopping by there in a couple days. After I left I get a group chat message from the landlord saying he’d be swinging by in a couple of days to check out a couple of things but didn’t specifically say what. We will see what happens in a couple of days when he does come, but for now I feel like I should move out a little sooner just so I don’t have to be in the shit storm that could unfold eventually.

I have been living with a couple of guys roommates for about a year now. We all get along just fine and we haven’t had many issues living with each other. Lately, one of the roommates, who has been feeling a little down lately, has all of a sudden wanted to make huge physical changes to the house. He wants new ceiling lighting in the living room and his bedroom. New cabinets and a new sink. He even wants to extend one of the side walls where our laundry sits and make it wider so it’s easier to share. Mind you, this is all very expensive and costly stuff to be deciding on, but apparently his dad renovated his own place and would help my roommate do it with little cost. 

One day I came home to him tearing out the ceiling lighting in the living room and taking out all of the wiring. I asked what he was doing and he said that he had ordered discounted ceiling lights that were way better than the current ones and he wanted to get a jump start on replacing them. I asked him if he had gotten permission from the landlords to which he turned around and said to me “why wouldn’t they want this change when it’s going to make the house better”. First, I believe you don’t make changes to someone’s property without asking them first. Second, he hadn’t even consulted with us first if we liked the change or not and now in the meantime we have barley andy lighting in the living room since he ripped them all out. I told him that it was wrong and he needed to ask permission first. He, again, told me that his way was going to be better anyways. 

Lately, it’s roommate has been going through some rough patches and he’s become slightly selfish over time but never to the extend of just making huge changes to OUR living space without consulting anyone first. I was pissed at the amount of disrespect so I told him that if he continued I would call the landlords and let them know what he was doing. He basically told me that even if they came over, that they would see these changes are better and it wouldn’t be an issue. 

I don’t know if I really want to call the landlords because I don’t want to cause drama but I hate how selfish and entitled he is acting. I am moving out in a month and as long as he doesn’t touch my room then do whatever you want and I believe karma comes around in the future to people who act selfishly.

So AITA?

Edit: my name is not on this lease, but the other two guy roommates are.

76,1dkfuft,AITAH for asking my friend is she is mad?,"I need some outside perspective. My friend Sam and I got invited to our friend Kim's graduation. We were beyond excited and joyful for our friend Kim, who just graduated from one of the hardest medical schools. Once Kim came out from the ceremony, we ran to her with just awe and tearful eyes. In the mist of all the chaos, with hugs and congratulations, our friend Kim motioned for Sam and me to take a photo. The following day, I was scrolling through the photos and found one I liked. I asked Sam and Kim for their approval if I could post a photo. Kim gave me the approval. But Sam stated, ""crop me out lol"". So, I didn't post anything, and a week goes by.

I went to a different friend's gradation and with that I was having a moment. The one where I was just so grateful for the people in my life. I wanted to express my gratitude, so I took to IG story and posted the photo previously mentioned. With the photo I Stated:

""To my Favorite doctor (Kim) and nurse (Sam) I am so proud and just speechless because I know there is no words to do justice. Love you queens"". Sam too just graduated from nursing school.

Before I posted, I messaged Sam seeking approval, but she didn't reply. So, I thought it was going to be okay, we looked beautiful and just looked happy. Once she did reply she was short. She appreciated my admiration for her. But I was getting this gut feeling, so I continue to message her. She then shared that she was really hurt by me, that she can't talk to me and needed space. I processed to apologize expressing that I never wanted to hurt her and that I would give her space.

10 days go by, and I see that I received a meme from Sam via IG. I was excited and eagerly asked: ""Is this your way of telling me you are not mad anymore?"" She reply's with ""you want me to stay mad? or do you think I'm the one that should apologize or something?"" I tell her I don't mean it in a negative tone, and I just wanted to check in with her. I also pointed out the fact I did not like this being over text, because I felt it was getting misinterpreted. Then she let me have it. She expressed she was done and that she can't be talking to me. I apologized again and told her I loved her and our friendship.

Before I go any further, I know IATAH for posting the photo. Regardless of good intentions and I how thought we looked, she said no and it's about the principle. Where I'm hurting is her statement of her being done like I wrong her for years. To give context of our friendship, we have been friends for 15 years. Been through life's challenges together. Shared laughers, tears, and called each other late at night because one of us was going through it. I've driven hours to hang out her because she was on that student struggle. When she visited me, I would make sure she was taken care of, pay for her food and gas. I am heartbroken of the haunting idea that our friendship might be over. I am hoping our friendship could work pass this. So AITAH?

81,1dkfdrg,AITA for speaking with an accent and not knowing my native tongue?,"I (19F) am from India, which if you don't know is a country with 28 official languages. I am from Tamil Nadu, and both my parents's heritage is from Kerala. They speak Tamil in Tamil Nadu and Malayalam in Kerala. Basically both sets of my grandparents are from Kerala and speak fluent Malayalam. Both my parents were born in Tamil Nadu, but since their parents speak Malayalam, they acquired both Tamil and Malayalam from their childhood.

I, on the other hand, was born in Chennai (capital of Tamil Nadu) and grew up speaking Tamil as the only native tongue I knew. I never got a chance to acquire Malayalam as a kid because my parents never spoke it to me as a kid and I didn't live in a Malayalam speaking state. Plus, I am pursuing a degree in literature and have always been fond of English as a language which has lead to several people I've met saying I speak English with an accent that Indians usually don't. It's usually never bothered me. Its never been directed as an insult before until today.

Some of my father's side of the family came to visit from Kerala and they were all talking to him in Malayalam. I didn't understand it so I kept to myself. When they talked to me I would respond in English, since its a language we both know. After a while, I had to take a call from a friend so I left the room. When I was about to come back, I overheard our guests shit talking me to my father behind my back. Mind you these are people who have known me since I was a baby.

Now she's got all these ideas in her head about white people and how the coloniser's language is superior. What was wrong with a good old public school where she could have learnt to speak atleast one language correctly?""

All of this was hurtful, but what hurt even more was that my dad never tried to stand up for me even once. When I asked him about this and he told me, I got angry and told him that they had no right to gossip about me like that. And then my dad says, ""Well they weren't lying.

82,1dkez7h,AITA for getting pissed with my friend?,"My friend (F14) and I (NB14) met in May after running into each other on a school trip. We clicked immediately, and have been near inseparable since. We hang out often, we're in the same summer courses, we have nearly the same schedule for next year, we have the same humor, etc.

I first got the ick from her when I went over with her to a friend's house for a sleepover. She was on a call with this British guy (M17) and was using a fake name and lying about her age. The guy seemed super cool and I wanted to get to know him outside of the call, as my friend wouldn't let me talk much to him. The sleepover turned into me third-wheeling my friend and this guy. I felt like a prop to her, someone she was using to look better. I had zero romantic interest (the age/maturity gap was really weird to me). I'm a very social person, and I just thought the guy was cool. However, she kept 'gatekeeping' this guy from me. It came off weird, especially since she told me she hated him and had no interest. She even gave him my insta and # just so he could block me, which is so odd in my opinion. I don't care that much anymore, and I can see how I could have come off weird in that context. This situation doesn't have anything to do with the post, just using it to add context as to how the dynamic has started to function and who we both are as people.

Flash forward to a week ago, I was on call with her and our friend at the time (M15). My friend had met both me and this guy at the school trip. We had known each other for the same amount of time, so there was no previous history and loyalties. This guy, out of the blue, calls her ugly. I immediately step in, and defend her. He turns on me, and starts insulting my weight for no reason. I will admit, I'm a bit overweight, but I'm not morbidly obese or anything. Just a little above average. My friend simply states 'that's not okay', but doesn't do anything else about it for the time being. This guy turns out to be a racist freak, and I cut him off for good. My final straw was when he was bullying my little sister (F9) at a swim meet for her weight. I don't tolerate that shit at all. Come today, and her phone goes off. She exclaims that it's the guy, who she then tells me she's been texting every day. I'm pissed, obviously, because she knows everything he's done. She's witnessed most of it. I stop talking (I'm autistic and have trouble speaking when my emotions get too intense for my liking) and she ignores me. That's chill, of course. I don't want attention when I'm like that. She then, however, removes me from her group from a project and starts talking and flirting with these guys, one of which she knows I have a crush on. Once again, treating me like a prop.

83,1dkex94,AITA for making my sister's friend leave?,"My name's Christina (21F) and have lived with my sister Sarah (19F) in an apartment for a year. Over this year, we've had several conversations about guests and how we can function cohesively. We come from a home with shared and individual traumas, so when we moved out together, we wanted a better life. It is important to note that I moved out and she tagged along, meaning her name is not on the lease and she rents the other room. We split the rent 50/50 and I cover all other bills (Electric and wifi) and any household necessities that we need (toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc.). For almost the entire year, she stopped in June, she was driving my car to/from work, and any errands she had to run, and as long as I wasn't needing it she could drive it. When we moved in I didn't have an issue with her excessive ""gardening"" because I also ""garden"" and we made a point to conceal the smell and keep the apartment tidy. In one bout of disagreements, she drank the rest of my 1.75L handle of vodka with her then-boyfriend who was staying here every single day. She leaves her ""friends"" in the apartment when neither one of us is home because SHE trusts them and I've never said more than a basic introduction to them. She has consistently proven that there is a lack of respect and boundaries in the apartment because she pays half of the rent. 

I've tried having conversations in the past, one ending in a fistfight that I did start, but again with every conversation I was promised that she would change and do better and because of where we come from it's hard to grow from it. I understand this, as I also come from the same home however I have lived in an apartment with one of my close friends before and understand that the only way out of trauma is to through and learn from it. I've recently set some boundaries and made it clear that if you're going to ""garden"" then the smell needs to be contained and concealed whether that be with candles or room sprays and that she is no longer welcome to have friends over more than 2 days a week. I work from home and I can hear them when I'm in meetings I've also tried talking to her about this but there has been no resolution other than her yelling at me that I'm unreasonable and ""just like mom"". A common tactic used by her is to manipulate me and keep me quiet because the last thing I want to be is like my mother. Because of these boundaries, she told me she would be moving out in September, which I have no issue with. We have since stopped talking on her accord and only communicate if specifically necessary. 

Yesterday, she invited her ""friend"" over. He had already been here on Monday and Tuesday so him being over on Wednesday was odd. Then I went into the bathroom after she and her ""friend"" because they showered together and found my speaker on the floor. The only outlet in the bathroom is on her side of the counter and it has never been brought to me that it being on her side was an issue. I confronted her and asked why the speaker was on the floor. She rebutted and said it was on her side and she didn't care that she hadn't spoken to me about it before so I just had to deal with it. 

I said- ""If we want to be unnecessary, let's get unnecessary, he needs to be gone before I leave at 5:30 pm""

 her- ""Are you going to threaten to call the cops?"" 

Me- ""You can leave with him, but he needs to be gone by 5:30""

After this exchange, more words were said and they both ended up walking out the door mumbling how I was crazy and doing too much. I followed them out of the door to ask what they were saying.

her man (who has no say in this conversation because he's 19 mooching off of a 19-year-old who's mooching off a 21 y.o.) ""Get your money up, f\*t b\*\*\*h. Have fun paying rent next month ugly b\*\*\*h.""

She stood beside him and they walked into the elevator to go to I'd assume a motel or something because he lives with his parents and they can't go back to his house. I had dance practice so I had to leave.

When I got home, she had taken the PS4 (which is hers) out of my room and returned my record player/speaker that was in her room. She took my HDMI chord that came with my work set and an Xfinity TV device that came with the router and Wi-Fi that I paid to get. I texted her and said I need these returned and both the mailbox key and house key that she has since apparently he speaks for her and will be out by the first of July. She said I needed to return the rent she gave for June + $300 to get the keys. I told her I could pay her $300 but since she's past 15 days staying here, the rent will not be returned. She rebutted and said that's the only way I'm getting the key.

I have emailed the leasing office to speak about options for changing my lock, and I've changed all the passwords to any subscriptions that I pay for that she might be using. All I wanted to do was discuss why the speaker was on the floor. I didn't want it to go this way because that's my sister and I love her, but the people in my life (friends, our other sister (23), and my parents) all agree that I've been enabling her behavior and I need to set boundaries for my sanity.

From what my brother told me he has autism and is a very introverted person, which is very easy to tell once you meet him. My brother treats him pretty baldly I'd say. He always talks about he finds all his quirks annoying and about how lucky his bf is that he's willing to deal with them cause nobody else would want stay in a relationship with him, monitors everything his boyfriend eats and essentially has him on a strict diet (even tho his boyfriend is already a pretty thin person) and also constantly about how his bf doesn't make enough money so they can have nice things and even tho his bf always looks uncomfortable with my brother talking about him like that he never says anything back to him. And that's just the things he says about him in public in front of me and even our parents, I don't even want to imagine what he says to him in private.

The last thing my brother complained about was how they couldn't afford to go on a trip to Greece cause of his bf's low income and once again said that his boyfriend is lucky that he loves him enough to get stuck with someone like him. I honestly got sick of my brother talking like that and I asked if he can pipe down already, making a scene over a damn trip wasn't worth it. He told me to not get involved cause this has nothing to do with me, but I told him that at this point it might as well cause I find the way he treats his own boyfriend really disgusting and he's pretty much acting like an emotional abuser. 

Well things escalated quickly and my brother started screaming at me that I'm only trying to paint him as an abuser cause I'm a jealous liar over not having my own boyfriend and not understanding how gay relationships work, that I'm delusional and the only disgusted person in the room while his boyfriend legit just apologized to my brother and told him to leave. They eventually did, but my brother also blocked me everywhere afterwards and my mom's been on my case about calling my brother an abuser. I asked if she hasn't seen the way he treats and talks about his boyfriend, but my mom said that their relationship isn't any of my business and I shouldn't have got involved in their conflicts cause it's now affecting our entire family due to my brother seemingly wanting to cut all contact off with me now.

Everything was fine until Dave asked me to grab some extra chairs from his basement. I head down there and accidentally knock over a box. Out spills a bunch of...“BDSM gear” and some pretty explicit stuff. I’m talking whips, cuffs, masks, ball gags, the whole shebang. I quickly try to shove it all back in, but not before Dave walks in and sees what happened.

He completely flips out, screaming about how I invaded his privacy and ruined everything. He’s yelling that I’ve exposed his “private collection” to the whole family, even though I didn’t tell anyone. But he was so loud that a few family members came over to see what the hell was going on, and now they’re all curious & asking questions. Dave stumbles over his words, but pretty much exposed himself while I just stood there shocked. 

Dave hasn’t spoken to me since and has been going on about how I’m a terrible person for snooping around his stuff, even though he’s the one who sent me down there.

Dave stumbles over his words, but pretty much exposed himself while I just stood there shocked. 

Dave hasn’t spoken to me since and has been going on about how I’m a terrible person for snooping around his stuff, even though he’s the one who sent me down there. Some family members think Dave is being ridiculous and needs to chill, while others are saying I should have been more careful. A lot of whispers going on within the family. I think some of them know what was in there and some don’t. 

He’s posting passive aggressive things on social media about boundaries and respect & I’m getting all these angry texts from Dave about how I’ve destroyed his reputation and how he can never look at me the same way again. I honestly feel terrible, but it was an accident. AITA for accidentally revealing my cousin’s BDSM collection? I honestly don’t know what to do because I cannot undo the accident.

86,1dkeq2h,AITA For letting my niece choose where her family lives?,"My brother died when my niece was 10. He was divorced from SIL at the time of his death. My brother's assets and my niece's cut of my parent's estate were placed in a trust for my niece. I was in charge of the trust. There was some back and forth with SIL over who controlled the trust, but I was ultimately the one who got control. The trust was basically able to pay off what was my brother's house and the interest from the estate pays for its upkeep. There isn't much left after that but at least my niece has a paid off house. In leu of my SIL going after the estate for child support I let her, and my niece move into the house rent free. 

My niece just turned 17 and is headed to her senior year of high school. My SIL has since remarried and has a new family with him one kid and one step kid. The new husband and family has moved into the house. The new husband apparently just got a job transfer and the whole family will have to move for the job. I talked to my niece about the move, and she hates the idea. She doesn't want to move with only one year left in HS. I agree with her on that issue.

My SIL wants me to sell the current house and use the funds to buy a new house in the new location. I told her that was automatically a no go. I wouldn't buy a house in a new location with my niece only likely living there full time for one more year. My niece plans to go to college and not likely in the area of the new house. This would be more a benefit for SIL than niece.

I gave my SIL three options. 

1. The family can continue to live in the current house and continue the deal as is. This means new hubby's job will fall through. The new location is closer to his family. 

2. We can sell the house; I will put the money into the trust. This will force my niece to move with her family. They may have to downsize because of me not giving money for a new house.

3. The family moves and then my niece stays behind she essentially does her senior year alone in the house. I'm not far from them and can check on her but can't be there daily. I'm out of her school district so she can't live with me and still go to the same school.

My Sil hates me right now over tearing her family apart. I really don't care about her hating me. 

If my niece was starting HS and not finishing it, I might act differently and not give her no as much weight in this decision. I might be willing to let SIL use the money to buy a new house. The issue is because she close to the end. I don't want to disrupt her schooling. If my niece said yes to the move, I might be willing to let SIL use the money as well.

My SO is a morning person and varies if he stays up late or passes out early. His job requires him to be up early, around 5:45-6:20am depending on the traffic that day. I have a retail job that varies when I go into work. Sometimes as early as 8:00am, sometimes as late as 1:00pm. The days that I’m off I like to sleep in, and sometimes it can be until almost 11:00am. If I have something planned in the AM that requires me to be up I’ll get up at an appropriate time. I also have trouble falling asleep to the point where I’ll lay in bed for over an hour not being able to turn my brain off, whereas my SO can just pass out. I try different things like counting sheep (yes, I know), walking around then getting back in bed, and even read a book for a bit. My SO likes to get up early every day and gets upset when he doesn’t get up by 9:00am. He will immediately start cleaning or try to workout. When I get up I walk around, drink coffee, and take the dog out.

My parents got involved and are pressuring me to lend him the car, saying it’s important for him to have a good time with his friends and that I should forgive and forget. They believe I’m being too harsh and that I should give him another chance.

Although they have changed and have become more popular and more conventional through the years compared to me. I met a new friend a couple years ago we’ll call her Safine, but Vivienne and I met Safine at the same time and we were a trio. We grew a strong friendship for a while but Vivienne began distancing and interacting with another friend group which at the time we thought nothing of it as we were on good terms and still hung out. However, as we began spending time with Vivienne at school she was very cold and avoidant with no eye contact - staring at the ceiling and her arms crossed and even if we talked at her she wouldn’t talk back, Not saying a word even if we spoke to her directly. Safine and I grew confused and picked up that something was wrong and Safine went to go talk to her (Vivienne and her popular group) about it and Vivienne said - “Well it’s either ‘my name’ or the group” making it a choice even though we occasionally hung out with this group. Vivienne also began using terms like “school friends” (popular girls) and “real friends” (us) to separate us which was weird. 

Moving on, Yesterday Safine and I went to class and we forgot to say hi to Vivienne and Sammy because we were busy with other matters and we didn’t notice. Before class, I turned around and saw Sammy and Vivienne and said hi, but they were very snarky and salty and Sammy said “ohhh hi ‘mispronounced version of my name’ i forgot about you, who are you?” and I was visibly confused but apologised and when we went in class they were even snarkier, especially Vivienne - who treated me to lunch the other day but asked for her money back. She also said “Oh why don’t you just go hang out with Safine? You’d prefer her over us wouldn’t you?” And gave me a dirty look. Then today when I went to class Vivienne sat next to Sammy instead of me and also bragged about taking her money back and added more snarky comments. I asked what they were punishing me for but I never got a direct answer just laughs.

93,1dkdg3r,AITA for telling my sister that her boyfriend shouldn't come along to our vacation? ,"My sister 21F wants to bring her boyfriend (20M) of two years to our family vacation. This vacation would include me (16M) and my parents. This vacation will happen in a few weeks, and my sister wants to bring her boyfriend. Our parents will be paying all the expenses, which is already an issue to me.

Yesterday, I had a fight with my sister because I found out that she asked her boyfriend to come. My sister has priorly only asked my parents. Important to mention is, that since she doesn't live with us, I had this conversation over text/audio messages. I have many reasons as to why I don't want him to come, those being:

My sister and her boyfriend have been fighting A LOT. My sister can't forgive him for a lot of the stuff he said, and neither of them can communicate at all. That leads to a fight like, once a week. Those fights are also very toxic: aka no one is pointing out actual issues and they're both just insulting eachother. My first thoughts were, that this is bound to happen during the vacation, since these fights always start over stupid bullshit.

Secondly: If a fight were to happen, me and my parents would suffer because of it. My sister gets angry extremely easily, and doesn't calm down quickly. If they were to have a fight, my sister would 100% start lashing out at the rest of us. I told her that it would also suck a lot for her, and that she shouldn't risk having a fight and ruining her vacation, since the risk is very high.

There's some other issues, but I want to explain her side next. I also want to add that I definitely could've said the above a little nicer, but looking back I still don't think that I was wrong.

First, she said that we shouldn't have given her the option to invite him in the first place if I wasn't okay with this, alongside the fact that she can't just uninvite him. I also mentioned to her that I don't like the fact that my parents are paying for all of her expenses even though she and her boyfriend both have their own income, to which she responded that it shoulnd't matter to me since our parents decided to pay anyway, not me. To my point that they were going to constantly fight, she responded that fighting is normal in a relationship and that they solved most of the stuff and she said that we won't notice the fighting. I already explained why I disagree with the last two points.

She's still pretty angry at me so I'm lead to believe that maybe I did something wrong? I still don't agree with her and I think she was way too aggressive. I was doing my best to be as reasonable as possible, and after letting my thoughts marinate for a day and listening to the audio messages again, I still think that I was right, that she was barely adressing my arguments and that she was unproportinately rude. But I feel like I'm missing something, so judging by what I wrote, AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-20,"AITA for telling my sister that her boyfriend shouldn't come along to our vacation?  My sister 21F wants to bring her boyfriend (20M) of two years to our family vacation. This vacation would include me (16M) and my parents. This vacation will happen in a few weeks, and my sister wants to bring her boyfriend. Our parents will be paying all the expenses, which is already an issue to me.

Yesterday, I had a fight with my sister because I found out that she asked her boyfriend to come. My sister has priorly only asked my parents. Important to mention is, that since she doesn't live with us, I had this conversation over text/audio messages. I have many reasons as to why I don't want him to come, those being:

My sister and her boyfriend have been fighting A LOT. My sister can't forgive him for a lot of the stuff he said, and neither of them can communicate at all. That leads to a fight like, once a week. Those fights are also very toxic: aka no one is pointing out actual issues and they're both just insulting eachother. My first thoughts were, that this is bound to happen during the vacation, since these fights always start over stupid bullshit.

Secondly: If a fight were to happen, me and my parents would suffer because of it. My sister gets angry extremely easily, and doesn't calm down quickly. If they were to have a fight, my sister would 100% start lashing out at the rest of us. I told her that it would also suck a lot for her, and that she shouldn't risk having a fight and ruining her vacation, since the risk is very high.

There's some other issues, but I want to explain her side next. I also want to add that I definitely could've said the above a little nicer, but looking back I still don't think that I was wrong.

First, she said that we shouldn't have given her the option to invite him in the first place if I wasn't okay with this, alongside the fact that she can't just uninvite him. I also mentioned to her that I don't like the fact that my parents are paying for all of her expenses even though she and her boyfriend both have their own income, to which she responded that it shoulnd't matter to me since our parents decided to pay anyway, not me. To my point that they were going to constantly fight, she responded that fighting is normal in a relationship and that they solved most of the stuff and she said that we won't notice the fighting. I already explained why I disagree with the last two points.

94,1dkd6na,AITAH mom used car for a jump without permission ,"I (19 m) just bought my first car it is a Beater and runs very rough and I have to drive it a certain way so that it doesn't sound like it'll fall apart. My mother (44 f) is always leaving her car light on and the battery in her car died. So at 6 am she asks me to come outside and Rev my engine so she can Jumpstart her car cause she couldn't do it by herself. I saw that she had taken my keys and drove my car up next to hers (she was mad about her battery being dead so she was obviously rough with my car) I asked her that next time she please ask me before she just uses my car like that cause again it's a Beater I don't know what will break it. She started screaming at me saying how she let me drive her car since I've gotten a license and how could scream that at her after all she's done for me (I want to make it clear I asked nicely didn't raise my voice at all) and in return I didn't yell back but I slammed the door because I had just woken up from a closing shift and didn't want to deal with her yelling and that's when she told me if I want to slam doors and yell at her than I better move out. Well long story short her car didn't take the Jumpstart and is completely dead so she decided to take my bike but threw it on the ground when her drink spilled on it and wouldn't let me drive her to the gym. My car is now making a very loud noise it wasn't making before and the power steering is even worse off than before as well. Please tell me AITAH?

Edit: I want to clear it up. I was exaggerating on the cars condition it drives and is fully functional it is safe and passed emissions. The car is in a little rough shape and I bought it so I could fix it up I only just bought it 4 days ago though so no repairs yet. It's not unsafe it just needs to be handled with more care because there are already issues with it that if pushed to their limits such to erratic of a movement on the wheels or revving the engine to fast that may be to much for it.

So I called my closest friends and family, as we did not want them to find out through social media. In my opinion, it’s rude.
My friends are so supportive, everyone has been crying when I’ve told them. My partners family and relatives are congratulating and welcoming me to the family. So spirits are high! 

But my own family and relatives… Bare minimum, if that.. I have a bad relationship with my parents due to horrific abuse that I’ve been in therapy for. I was not expecting anything from them as I don’t talk to them. It’s been many years at this point. 

But for the rest, my siblings and relatives… I’m honestly super disappointed that not one has reached out with any kind of enthusiasm. I don’t know how to feel about it. I thought my own family would be happy for me. But they can’t even muster up a smile when I called them..

To add: my partner has never been mean or harmed me in anyway. Actually really the opposite. My partner is the most supportive, kind and generous soul one can meet. So they do not have ANY reasons to not be happy for us…

96,1dkcrcz,AITA for only inviting my two sisters and brother to my wedding and nobody else in my family?,"I (25m) am happily engaged to Clara (24f) and we're in the final stages of wedding stuff. Invites were sent out recently and as you can see from the title, this has caused some controversy. To give you the full context I need to provide background.

So, my parents had a unique situation growing up. Sorta like sister wives but not sister wives. My dad had four women he would rotate around and knock up. With my mom he had Jase (27m), me, Cassie (22f) and Robyn (20f). Between the other three women he had an additional 15 children. He's married to none of them, doesn't really live with any of them either and there were a lot of breakups and makeups over the last 3 decades since this rotational thing started. Sometimes it was presented like we were a big family but typically the women he was sleeping with at the time was meant to be someone all the kids gravitated toward and we were meant to have one big sibling bond vs bonds only formed with the kids who shared the same mom.

The three other women other than my mom are Ellen (7 kids with dad), Trina (5 kids with dad) and Elizabeth (3 kids with dad). Of the three other women Elizabeth is the one who I think hoped all the kids would embrace her and look to her as a second mom. She inserted herself into our lives in some weird ways at times. She also felt that because her kids had the smallest sibling group, they deserved more of us being close to them. Ellen and Trina didn't exactly mistreat us but I'm not sure they wanted the ""other"" kids around either. But they had 7 and 5 kids respectively so who can really blame them.

It was rare my dad would have all his kids under one roof. It did happen at times. But was very rare. He was never a very good dad because he was always more concerned with his dick than his kids.

I'm close to my siblings. I consider my siblings to be Jase, Cassie and Robyn. I really don't speak to anyone else anymore. Very rarely. My siblings are the same. We're not close to either parent or anyone else.

So when Clara and I were figuring out our guest list I told her my siblings were the only ones I wanted at our wedding and they're the only people we invited. Then mom found out via Robyn's Instagram about my wedding and she told dad, he told his other families and there are a lot of pissed out people who found ways to contact me and told me I should have invited them. Elizabeth was just as upset and angry as my parents were. My mom asked how I could get married without her when she was the consistent adult in my life. I told her she brought us into a mess and willingly exposed us to that mess our whole lives.

97,1dkchnz,AITAH For Being Fed Up With Spouses Unemployment,"I (33F) have been with my spouse (44M) for 9 years. We both have a child from a previous marriage and a 20m baby together. Our relationship has always been stressful, but we typically only fight about finances. We met in 2016 working together shortly after he was laid off from a well paying job. He shared that being laid off impacted him deeply. In Apr 2017 he was laid off this job too. I was going to school for a double masters and working two part time/free lance jobs at the time. I moved in with him Aug 2017 and began supporting the household. He landed a contractor position at a highly sought after company but without benefits. He was depressed and began self medicating all day with weed. Eventually, I encouraged him to make a change since he was feeling depressed, so he quit to pursue his own thing. I graduated in 2018 and got a job at my dream company, but the paycheck didn't cover the entire financial burden alone, so I continued working side jobs to make ends meet. I had a medical emergency and temporarily left my dream company, but I still had to work freelance. This led to me being poached by an Oil and Gas company offering a higher paycheck. I started working FT Dec. 2019. This was a huge career shift and provided no job satisfaction. Covid hit 3 months on the job. Our children didn't return to school, so my husband became their surrogate teacher from the second half of kindergarten through all of 1st grade. My job required me to still come to the office. Ultimately, our family got Covid and he was hospitalized. The bill was 10k, so I worked even more part time jobs to pay it off. I didn't want him to get sick again and he was teaching our children, so I reasoned that it was appropriate that he not work at this time, although I was really struggling, busting my ass and missing my kids. Fast forward to 2024, I'm still working the job I hate. He still hasn't worked because we had a baby in 2022. I want to put her in daycare and he return to work, but he is resistant and feels unsupported emotionally. I cannot afford daycare without supplemental income, so I need him to commit to and actually get a job, but the conversation always results in a fight. All I am asking is that he get a part time job. He has had no income since 2018 and I have worked nonstop. He feels controlled and not believed in, but I feel unsupported and taken advantage of. I have four degrees and I am a disabled veteran. He doesn't have a degree and feels like he has no skills. He has ADD and is not medicated.

This is ancillary, but I am also hurt that I spent my whole life dedicated to my career path just to give it up to support another adult. I don't want him to suffer because I am suffering, but it feels a way that he won't even look for work because it is, ""depressing"" when I suffering now.

99,1dkc175,AITA For Saving Up For a Gift?,"Hello, I’m hoping you can give me some good advice, like some of you did the last time I came for help!

my wife is a capital G gamer, and while I myself am not, I love her very much. She plays an online game, and the last time an expansion came out, I kind of showed my ass a little due to some insecurities. We worked it out and our relationship is stronger than ever. Right now though, money is tight, and a few months ago we went into severe budgeting. One of the first things my wife gave up was her game subscription and her plan to preorder the new game she was looking forward to. After how I acted last time I wanted to do something special for her, so I started picking up some gig work to save up enough money that I could surprise her with the expansion she wanted alongside a game card and a DoorDash gift card, so she could enjoy her game and as a thank you for how hard she works for us. 

Well, because karma loves a joke, we had an unexpected car emergency about two weeks ago. The repair price came to about $250, and my wife was stressing about affording it when I offered up the $200 I’d saved for her gift. She started crying, and said she was touched by my trying to give her the gift. We were able to repair the car, and I thought things would go back to normal.

Since that time though she’s been really really sad and down. I’ve tried everything to cheer her up/and get her to talk about what was wrong, and finally she told me that she had come to terms with not playing her game for a while, but when she saw the money I saved, “it was like something was dangled in front of me before being yanked away again.” She said she doesn’t blame me and she thought my gesture was kind, but now she’s been so sad and worse mentally than before she knew, it’s like I made things worse trying to fix things. I asked my best friend and they said I was the asshole for telling her why I was saving up the money.

100,1dkbupb,AITA for talking to my girlfriend about being upset over a trip being cancelled?,"My girlfriend and I are keeping our relationship a secret from everyone (our friends and family) because of homophobia reasons. Last year before we got in a relationship, we were both figuring out our feelings for each other which led to her ditching her friend group to spend time with me. Fast forward to this year, I had planned out a trip since early March for us to go somewhere and spend our anniversary together (we were long distance for college). By mid-late April her friends said that they wanted to do a beach trip which is week long and covered the day of our trip. At first she chose that she would do half of their beach trip and then come back for our trip but when we both came home from college she said she wanted to go with them for the full week and wouldn’t compromise to come home a day earlier to make our trip. I do understand that she was trying to make things up to them but I took a lot of effort to plan this and was booked to go (I ended up just cancelling it when she was on the trip). 

Right before and the beginning of her trip with her friends, I feel like reality hit me and I was so insanely upset because I couldn’t understand why she just didn’t do both. She acted very cold on the entire trip and we barely texted the day of our anniversary. I was honestly just done with things and I was going to end things but when she came back she apologized and wanted time to prove that she is going to make it up.

My girlfriend and I are keeping our relationship a secret from everyone (our friends and family) because of homophobia reasons. Last year before we got in a relationship, we were both figuring out our feelings for each other which led to her ditching her friend group to spend time with me. Fast forward to this year, I had planned out a trip since early March for us to go somewhere and spend our anniversary together (we were long distance for college). By mid-late April her friends said that they wanted to do a beach trip which is week long and covered the day of our trip. At first she chose that she would do half of their beach trip and then come back for our trip but when we both came home from college she said she wanted to go with them for the full week and wouldn’t compromise to come home a day earlier to make our trip. I do understand that she was trying to make things up to them but I took a lot of effort to plan this and was booked to go (I ended up just cancelling it when she was on the trip). 

Right before and the beginning of her trip with her friends, I feel like reality hit me and I was so insanely upset because I couldn’t understand why she just didn’t do both. She acted very cold on the entire trip and we barely texted the day of our anniversary. I was honestly just done with things and I was going to end things but when she came back she apologized and wanted time to prove that she is going to make it up.

101,1dkbtgk,AITA for telling my mom to practice what she preaches?,"So I (26F) recently had to clean our house yesterday, which I don't mind because I know it's a big responsibility and I block entire days off to ensure it gets done. 

However, one of the things I do during these days is vacuum and carpet clean the house, which takes a lot of time and energy (along with sweeping and mopping the floor). I don't mind doing it, but the issue I'm having is that every time I get ready to clean, my mom always makes little comments about how we need to ""Get it together,"" or ""Clean this part of the house"", etc. while she does nothing. 

Seriously, all while I was cleaning yesterday she did NOTHING, except sit in front of the television and watch K-dramas. To add insult to injury, I had to go and clean her bathroom so I could hang a few towels to dry (since our dryer is broken but the room gets a good amount of sunlight to help it dry) but her toilet was disgusting and had mold all under the toilet seat. This took me an extra 30 minutes to an hour since I was already tired from cleaning the entire day and my feet were starting to hurt. I started cleaning at around 8:30am and didn't finish until around 11:00pm (counting breaks for meals and quick rests since I have a slightly sprained foot).

She used to get on me about how terrible at cleaning I was as a kid but seeing this just infuriated me, especially since I've told her multiple times to keep her bathroom clean since I hate seeing dirty bathrooms (might be a bit a germaphobe tbh). When I confronted her about the issue and how gross it was, she snapped at me and told me to ""Shut up talking to her because I'm being negative.""

The snapping point came from this morning when I asked my mom to walk the dog since my feet were still sore. She made a comment saying that we need to start switching our outdor shoes with differents to walk around the house in... which is something I already do.

I've been doing that for a good couple years now, because I wanted to be cleaner. 

I snapped back and sad  ""What do you mean ""We""? I've been doing that already.""  and she started talking out loud about how her daughter (me) ""always has something negative to say"". Seriously, she started going on and on to herself out loud as if she was talking to someone and all I could do was roll my eyes. 

I've been told I'm always too sensitive to things, but when I don't say anthing I'm told that I should've spoken up... but then when I do it's the same ""You shouldn't have said that"" or ""You're being too sensitive"" and the whole thing starts all over again. 

TLDR: I was cleaning all day yesterday and had to clean my mom's bathroom, which I didn't plan to, and when confronting her about it (feet sore and everything), and after trying to lecture me, I snapped back and told her to practice what she preaches.

102,1dkbneb,AITA for shouting at a stranger who told me take off my headphones in a public place? ,"To give some context on this, I was walking through the town centre where I live listening to a podcast, when a stranger ran up besides me and tapped me, and told me I should be aware of my surroundings because in London somebody would’ve stolen my phone. 

Initially I nodded and said okay thanks, then as he was walking away he told me to keep my headphones off. 

The last bit did piss me off, so I did shout after him something along the lines of “dude, this isn’t London it’s xxx, cmon!” Which earnt me a dirty look and a brief moment like he was going to run back and square up to me.But He kept going and that was that. 

I felt bad immediately, as I’m not a confrontational person and he probably was trying to be helpful.From my perspective I live in an extremely middle class town with extremely low crime, and was walking on a high street in full daylight. I also listen to podcasts walking because I have one of those minds that goes a 1000 miles an hour and it helps level out my anxiety, which was probably also triggered by a random person entering my personal space as well. 

I do feel bad about it and wished I’d dealt with differently. I guess my question is how reasonable my reaction was, or whether I am 100% the asshole in this? 

Also, I’m aware of my surroundings enough not to bump into people or do something dumb like walk in traffic.

103,1dkbjqe,AITA for being ungrateful of furniture gifted by my MIL?,"
My husband and I recently found out we would be expecting our second child soon. We are planning on giving the new baby our 2 year old son’s current room since it already has a crib, changing table, rocking chair, etc. We are planning on giving my son a room all on his own so that he has something exciting just for him while transitioning to life with a new baby in the house. My parents offered to buy a bed and my MIL offered to buy a dresser for my son’s new room. Well my son LOVES Lightning McQueen, so both sets of parents have asked if we’re planning on getting one of those small toddler car beds. I have said multiple times that we’d rather get something neutral (the bed could be passed down and we’re waiting to find out the gender…plus my next kid might not like Cars regardless of gender) and that we’d rather get a twin bed so that it can be used for many years. Lo and behold…my MIL bought him a Lightning McQueen bed frame, mattress, and bedding without letting my husband or I know beforehand. She’s acting offended now and claiming “well I just thought my grandson would enjoy it.” AITA for being ungrateful and wanting to return these things gifted to him? 


EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and feedback! Still on the fence as to how to approach the situation, my husband is out of town this week for work and I’d rather us be able to have a conversation and come to an agreement together. I should probably clarify it’s not so much him getting the racecar bed that has me upset, but rather my MIL overstepping when our wants were already made clear. She has done this consistently and doesn’t seem to pick up on cues when we’ve told her issues that bother us. For example, she announced when I was going into labor on social media and posted pictures online of my son before us (she took them down thankfully when we asked). She also has been told NUMEROUS times not to kiss him on the lips (for health reasons obviously we don’t want anyone doing this) but we always catch her doing it. There are others, but those stick out the most as far as overstepping. I am leaning towards having the bed for a few months/up to a year before getting him a twin bed like originally planned. I have no doubt he’ll love it! But I’m thinking of having a conversation with her to say that she should’ve asked before deciding to do such a big purchase, especially when my own parents have been looking forward to getting his bed and we had stated multiple times that we were looking for a different kind of bed. I’m not a “sad beige mom” who doesn’t let my kid have fun, his room/our home is decked out with all sorts of color and fun toys. I’ve just been raised in a practical manner so that was my train of thought. As the youngest sibling, I also got stuck with my older siblings character themed clothes/toys/etc. even if I didn’t always like the characters. I figured something neutral that could be passed down for my kids would help eliminate them getting stuck with something they might not like.

105,1dkbi1s,AITA for telling my friend his game is stupid?,"I'm 23f, he's 23m. He's my friend, has been since elementary school. He's gay, so there's nothing romantic between us either. Our friend group is very active, but he's not anymore. He's now disabled and unable to do most activities we used to do because he can't walk long distances and his dominant arm gives him problems. He was in an accident at his workplace.

He was very depressed for the longest time, and still struggles with things. It's been over a year since the accident. While he's not as depressed in general anymore, he does get sad when we go on our trips without him and he doesn't have good self image anymore. He's a VERY handsome guy, and any man would be lucky to have him. But he thinks because he's disabled and his income is disability that he's not fit to date anyone.

Anyone real...apparently.

Around the time he started feeling less depressed, his sister got him into video games which none of us in our friend group are into. We like being active, not pretending to be. But a few months ago, he got this one popular game and it really turned things around for him. Namely the fact you can date other characters, which is weird to me.

He's grown very attached to this game, and tries to talk to us about it. A couple in the group act interested, the rest of us just don't really care. I try to talk to him about getting out into the real world again but he doesn't seem interested.

Well once again he tried to talk about this game and this character he really likes, and I finally had enough. I told him no one cares about his stupid game and he needs to find someone real and experience the real world however he can again. No one else said anything and he left to get an Uber home. One of our friends tried to offer him a ride but he just quietly denied and left.

We all went home aftet and I got back to find he left our group chats and blocked me. I don't know if he's blocked the others as well. He left me one last message saying:

""That game is the only way I can feel like a normal person again. I'm not disabled. I can walk as long as I want. I can explore everything it will allow me without my body hurting. (Character) might not be real, but he looks at my character in ways I wish I could be looked at. I only get looked at with pity anymore. He doesn't see that, no one I meet in that game does. So forgive me for finding something that brings me joy. It can't replace real life. (Character) can't replace the love and touch of a real person. But it's as close as I'll ever get.""

Our friend group had mixed emotions about the whole thing. But when I ranted to my sister about it, she got indignant and told me that I messed up big. She said I was a jerk for making him feel more isolated and for not entertaining him talking about that dumb game. I told her I just wanted him to experience real life and real people instead of focusing on that stupid game but she hung up.

106,1dkaq4l,"AITA for leaving some work to my colleague, while I was donating blood ","On June 11th I got the message from the blood donation center, that my blood type is needed. The very next day I informed my supervisor via system, that I want to donate (beacuse in my country you get 2 days off at work for doing it and you have to give a memo). I waited for the acceptance of my ""application"", but my supervisor, not caring a lot about the well being of her subordinates, didn't notice it for the entire week and didn't do much about it. In the end she's accepted it the day I put a paper with the info on her desk.

That past week in job I was unfocused, drifitng away with my mind, due to chaotic atmosphere in my workplace. My chores these 2 weeks were to coordinate a premiere of the catalogue of my company, so to check if: 

* the social media posts are ready,
* the photos of the products are right,
* the database of products looks right
* and (what i wasn't aware of bc i work here less than a year) the printing company knows what to do.

The date of these ""preparatory works"" is due to June 24th. Ngl I forgot about the catalogue due to hectic atmosphere. I thought I could take care of everything much earlier, but we had some delay. Usually, printing company was well before the schedule, but unlucky for me, this time they wasn't the case. I couldn't get the necessary information from them on time, so I left it for one of my colleagues.

That colleague, who has basically the same job (but takes care of a different catalogue) had to write some social media texts with me to prepare the posts. Before ""my turn to take care of the catalogue"" I thought that she was the one writing (almost) all of the texts (because it looked like that from my perspective). In the mail with a list of chorses for everyone I wrote specifically ""social media texts: \[her name\]/\[my name\]"" (like in previous mails written by an older colleague). Usually I was a ""support"" in this situation, so if she for sure wasn't going to take care of it, it becomes my job.

I've donated blood, I got a day off. I couldn't do it any other day, beacuse I had a very tight schedule for the past few weeks. My colleague was texting me guilt tripping messages (maybe rightfully so), that I left her this workload. The workload was: 

* to call a printing company, she contacted very often (it was her responsibility to get the early info like printing prices, type of paper etc.),
* to write 6 social media texts using Chat GPT,
* copying and pasting some info from one excel sheet to another (this one I've forgotten, so I admit it. This was due to the workload).

The rest of this work, I can take care on the due date (if I'll focus), but what's done is done and I might here some bitter truth in my face after I'll get back to work, both from my colleague and my supervisor. Also, that colleague helps me in some situations I can't deal with so well (I have mild to moderate social anxiety and she's an extrovert), so I might seem ungrateful this time.

113,1dk86f2,AITA for getting my dad removed from his parents will?,"I (19M) have a younger sister called Cassidy (16F). I have more younger siblings but this concerns Cassidy.

Cassidy is the person my dad blames for his divorce from my mother. He introduced his mistress to her when she was 10 (she was his favourite kid) and she told our mum. They split, he has never forgiven her since. 

My mum later married a man called Andy when Cass was 15. Andy is a prick and he would constantly pick fights with Cass. This situation resulted in Cassidy having to move half way across the country to live with our dad in London. Dad’s wife, Sam, is also awful (the mistress he later married) and she HATES the fact that he has other kids because that means he can’t give his full attention to her and her kids.

I try my best to keep up with Cassidy and make sure she’s okay, but I live in Scotland for university. Train tickets for me to visit her or vice versa are expensive as hell and I’m in no position to keep paying for them. I considered having her move in with me since I have a flat with my boyfriend, but the education system in England and Scotland is slightly different (different exams) so I don’t know how well she’d do considering all the other disruption in her life. 

Anyway, as I suspected, my dad is doing a shit job of raising Cassidy. He allows his wife to bully her constantly, his step kids are nasty to her and she’s having a miserable time there. He’s also been restricting her access to her phone (that I pay for btw) because he doesn’t want her to tell me about what goes on in that house. It all came to a head last week when she ran away and only reappeared yesterday. She’s refusing to tell anyone where she went but it’s obvious that this situation can’t continue. My dad said that he was going to send her to live with me which I was okay with, but I didn’t think it was the right decision for her. She also doesn’t want to move up to scotland either.


I decided to call up my dad’s parents and they have offered to take Cassidy. They live just outside of London, and were also so pissed that they’ve said they’re cutting my dad from the will. They’re also disinheriting my half siblings from his wife Sam and giving all of that to Cassidy as compensation for the trauma he’s caused her. It’s a lot of money that’ll definitely set her up which I think is great because she deserves it. 

My father is infuriated right now. He said that sending Cass to live with me was the right choice for her since we get along really well (and she isn’t that close to our grandparents) but I think that they’ll be better equipped to look after her than me. It also saves the disruption of having another big move in such a short amount of time for her. He said that I knew his parents would disinherit him which is true, they’ve threatened it before and he thinks I ‘snitched’ to make sure it would happen.

114,1dk7adv,AITA for buying my grandmother's house from her?,"I need to get some things off of my chest and see what people not close to the situation think so here goes.  

My grandmother passed away several weeks ago. She would always do what she could for her kids and grandkids, but that wasn't always the best thing to do. Some family members would take advantage of her and try to bleed her dry.  

Whether it was aunts and uncles going to her for money for things they didn't need and couldn't afford to pay her back, people living with her and not contributing a cent in terms of bills, groceries, etc.  

That's what led to her to borrowing a substantial sum against her home to give money to other family members for things like cars, home renovations, etc. I wasn't aware of this until my mother mentioned to me that my grandmother's home was close to being foreclosured on and no one in the family could/would help (it was obvious she was trying to subtly ask for help).  

I met with my grandmother and we talked about it. At first she asked if I could lend her the money she was behind to stop the house being seized but it became obvious very quickly that not only would she not be able to pay me back but that she wouldn't be able to cover the repayments to the bank once she was caught up and would be in the same position again.  

After some back and forth between her, my mother and I, we agreed that I would take over everything. I would take over the future repayments to the bank, pay the outstanding amount, reimburse my grandmother for the payments she had already made as well as give her some a payment to cover the difference between the loan value and the actual value of the house.  

In exchange, the house would be signed over to me but she would be able to continue to live there and do as she pleased (eg: letting other family members live there if/when they needed it) and I would also do some renovations to the house to make things easier on her (installing solar panels to lower the power bills, power efficient air conditioning rather than the old portable ones she used, amongst other things).  

She requested that she be allowed to explain it to the rest of the family and I agreed. Everything was finalised, the house was in my name, everything was paid, the renovations got done and all was well. The family seemed happy (likely since they ended up getting most of the money I paid to my grandmother) and life went on.  

But now with her passing I came to find out that no one else in the family knew I owned the house and they only found out after it was revealed the house and most of its contents weren't mentioned in her will.  

This has led to most of the family saying I took advantage of her and things have gotten very ugly and personal.

115,1dk792g,AITA for not talking to my aunt anymore,"**Quick context:** I (24F) came from a very bad home growing up, and it was such a huge problem that my school and everyone noticed so they made my parents leave, and I had to live with my grandmother instead. My aunt is the neighbor of my grandmother, and we've always had a bit of a rocky relationship.

**The problem:** My aunt is incredibly religious. She's the type of person to post bible verses everyday on FB and insist her kids go to mass even if they don't want to. Weirdly enough, she is married to an atheist (my uncle in law), and is okay with things like gay marriage and stuff as long as it's not happening in HER family.

**First incident:** I'm incredibly close to my aunt's daughter Isabel (my cousin). We're near each other's age and basically grew up as neighbors and sisters because I lived with my grandmother. Everything used to be fine until Isabel stopped wanting to go to mass (likely just grew out of being religious, maybe influenced by her atheist dad). My aunt somehow found a way to blame this on me. It culminated in a whole screaming match, and me being called a horrible influence on my cousin. I am an atheist, but I wasn't really loud about it...I just stopped going to mass on my own. My aunt banned me and my cousin from seeing each other for around a year, and it was really hard for me because I was like 10 when this happened, and didn't really understand family politics and stuff like that. Eventually, this was resolved, but my aunt would always blame me when Isabel refused to go to mass.

**Second incident:** I came out as bi when I was around 17 years old. My whole family was chill about it, even my aunt (or so it seemed). But then my cousin Isabel came out as bi too, and my aunt then blamed me for this and banned us from seeing each other again. I don't know how that happened because at this point, I wasn't open about being bi, and actually was dorming far away from home.

**Third incident:** Growing up, my aunt was quite controlling and protective of Isabel. At 16-18, she wasn't allowed to even leave her house to walk so much as a block away even if we lived in a very affluent neighborhood. I'm a huge fitness person so I would workout every day or so growing up, and so I would jog or bike around our subdivision. Isabel would join me at times, and every time she would get in trouble and I'd get scolded by my aunt. I would get confused because Isabel did ask for permission beforehand, but my aunt is moody and I guess has anger issues.

**Fourth incident:** This was the most recent incident that caused me to stop talking to my aunt or even acknowledging her. Around a week ago, my cousin Isabel (now 22F), and I were supposed to gym together. Apparently, my aunt had messaged Isabel she's not allowed to go anymore, but Isabel didn't see the message. We were stopped as we were about to leave through the main gate, and my aunt was yelling and screaming her wits off along with her housekeeper. Her housekeeper was also yelling at me. I looked at my aunt, but she didn't stop it. After that incident, I stopped contacting her immediately and never talked to her again as I felt really betrayed that she let others disrespect me. 

These aren't even all the incidents, there were a handful that happened growing up. What makes me sad is that **my aunt is a good person** outside of all of this. She did help save me from my parents who were really bad to me, and she has provided monetarily for me at times when I needed it growing up. However, she does always use me as a scapegoat, something the rest of my family, even her husband, is upset at her for, but no one will correct her. My whole family is nonconfrontational, and my cousin Isabel has tried her best to stand up for me growing up, but she just ends up getting punished.

Recently, my aunt has been treating the whole family out to meals, and inviting me, and I do go and stuff, but I no longer talk to her nor acknowledge her unless forced to.

AITA for not talking to her anymore? ",TL;DR,2024-06-20,"AITA for not talking to my aunt anymore **Quick context:** I (24F) came from a very bad home growing up, and it was such a huge problem that my school and everyone noticed so they made my parents leave, and I had to live with my grandmother instead. My aunt is the neighbor of my grandmother, and we've always had a bit of a rocky relationship.

**The problem:** My aunt is incredibly religious. She's the type of person to post bible verses everyday on FB and insist her kids go to mass even if they don't want to. Weirdly enough, she is married to an atheist (my uncle in law), and is okay with things like gay marriage and stuff as long as it's not happening in HER family.

**First incident:** I'm incredibly close to my aunt's daughter Isabel (my cousin). We're near each other's age and basically grew up as neighbors and sisters because I lived with my grandmother. Everything used to be fine until Isabel stopped wanting to go to mass (likely just grew out of being religious, maybe influenced by her atheist dad). My aunt somehow found a way to blame this on me. It culminated in a whole screaming match, and me being called a horrible influence on my cousin. I am an atheist, but I wasn't really loud about it...I just stopped going to mass on my own. My aunt banned me and my cousin from seeing each other for around a year, and it was really hard for me because I was like 10 when this happened, and didn't really understand family politics and stuff like that. Eventually, this was resolved, but my aunt would always blame me when Isabel refused to go to mass.

**Second incident:** I came out as bi when I was around 17 years old. My whole family was chill about it, even my aunt (or so it seemed). But then my cousin Isabel came out as bi too, and my aunt then blamed me for this and banned us from seeing each other again. I don't know how that happened because at this point, I wasn't open about being bi, and actually was dorming far away from home.

**Third incident:** Growing up, my aunt was quite controlling and protective of Isabel. At 16-18, she wasn't allowed to even leave her house to walk so much as a block away even if we lived in a very affluent neighborhood. I'm a huge fitness person so I would workout every day or so growing up, and so I would jog or bike around our subdivision. Isabel would join me at times, and every time she would get in trouble and I'd get scolded by my aunt. I would get confused because Isabel did ask for permission beforehand, but my aunt is moody and I guess has anger issues.

**Fourth incident:** This was the most recent incident that caused me to stop talking to my aunt or even acknowledging her. Around a week ago, my cousin Isabel (now 22F), and I were supposed to gym together. Apparently, my aunt had messaged Isabel she's not allowed to go anymore, but Isabel didn't see the message. We were stopped as we were about to leave through the main gate, and my aunt was yelling and screaming her wits off along with her housekeeper. Her housekeeper was also yelling at me. I looked at my aunt, but she didn't stop it. After that incident, I stopped contacting her immediately and never talked to her again as I felt really betrayed that she let others disrespect me. 

These aren't even all the incidents, there were a handful that happened growing up. What makes me sad is that **my aunt is a good person** outside of all of this. She did help save me from my parents who were really bad to me, and she has provided monetarily for me at times when I needed it growing up. However, she does always use me as a scapegoat, something the rest of my family, even her husband, is upset at her for, but no one will correct her. My whole family is nonconfrontational, and my cousin Isabel has tried her best to stand up for me growing up, but she just ends up getting punished.

116,1dk6umj,AITA if a shopkeeper told me to never come back because I cast ‘black Magic’,"Hello! I’ve had a pretty bad experience on Reddit but I need you guys for this.

So.I’m 15 and I recently got a haircut.I cut my waist length hair to half its length.Anyhow, after walking out of the salon,I went to my local shop which had chips and stuff.

I went in there and realised that a piece of my hair was inside my crocs,so I shook my foot and made all the hair fall out of it.This was almost 2-3 weeks ago.

I went to the shop today and she stared at me with avery seriou look on her face ad said “I know what you came here for” I was shocked because she looked like she was about to tell me she had seen me steal something(I didn’t actually steal.Those were just irrational thoughts.)or was about to make a really bad joke.

Here is the conversation that took place

”I know what you came here for”

“Yeah….(she kept staring angrily)….chips”

”You left a piece of your cut off hair in my shop.I think we all know what that means”

(I thought she was about to scold me for littering.)

”I din‘t do it intentionally.There was a piece of hair in my cross so I- ”

”It’s black magic. Me and the people close to me believe it. You know right.”

(I just nodded because I didn’t know what the fuck that meant and she freaked me out)

”I din‘t do it intentionally.There was a piece of hair in my cross.I-“

”If you knew then why did you not do it outside. Please don’t come back here again.”

”Ok”

”Now put back the stuff you were about to buy and go.”

”Ok”

What do you think?Was I the asshole?I know I was wrong for littering and I regret it.I don’t usually litter,I was just very uncomfortable with my hair sticking to my foot.

(I found out from a friend that doing this mean someone will die or it will bring bad luck.He also said that if the hair is mine,I will be the one who is cursed.I also need to chant to cast the spell.)So even from a religious standpoint,I don’t know where she’s coming from???

I know she (57 F) doesn’t hate me and I’ve never doubted her love, but sometimes we just get into certain arguments and I express that the way she said her point hurts me and then she’ll say that the way I treat her hurts her.

For the past couple years, I've been the only one to make full meals for the four of us, and each time I cook, I'm left to do all the dishes, despite the rule of ‘if you cook, you don't clean’.

I’ve recently gotten into the habit of leaving the dishes in the sink if I'm not feeling up to washing them. Yes, there are times I go back and do the dishes, and other times I wash as I go, which includes cutting into their time to make their plates and sitting at the table waiting for me so they can eat.

To make a long story short I (F 32) have been married to my husband (M 45) for almost 9 years now. When we met he had a lot of baggage and issues that I did my absolute best to help him through. Custody battles, severe mental health issues, and worst of all alcoholism. I won’t get into detail but it was an extremely difficult and beyond rocky beginning to say the least. I’m happy to say he has been alcohol free for 8 years BUT during his active addiction (long before I knew him) he received a few DUIs and had his license taken. So in order to get his license back he has to have a “blow and go” installed into a vehicle for a few years. Here’s the problem… I own my vehicle, it’s in my name strictly. Same with insurance. I can sign off on his application to the DMV that he has my permission to install the blow and go in my vehicle, but I won’t…. I don’t think it’s fair to me AT ALL. We have three small children (ages 4 months, 5 years and 7 years) and I don’t want to be at the pediatricians office, playground, school pick up line, grocery store, VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE and be seen blowing into my car with my three babies in the back just to get it started to go where I need to go. We live in a super small town and it’s a super judgy area. (Also in a massive opioid epidemic). I’d be the talk of the town as the worst mother ever. I can hear the rumors and accusations now.. “oh, I heard she was pulled over with the kids in the car and she was wasted!” “I heard she was higher than a kite with those babies in car and that’s why she has the blow and go.” I have a reputation here and I’ve worked VERY hard to get it where it is. I don’t want it trashed and ruined. Also, to add.. he won’t save money to buy himself a vehicle and constantly blames me for the reason he can’t save money EVEN THOUGH I have no idea what his card number is or checks are located. We’ve never had a joined account and he’s a disabled veteran with both VA income and social security. Meanwhile, I’ve had a job from day one. I don’t know, I’m torn and feel like an asshole for not letting him put the blow and go in my car, but in the same breath I’ve stood my ground and said no because I don’t want people whispering and it effecting my children’s lives.

122,1dk640u,AITA for telling my father he should try being a better dad to his younger kid instead of fucking her over too?,"My father wasn't a great parent to me (17m) and my sister (19f). He never showed up for any of our school plays or games. He never took the time to just spend with us, either as a family or as a a father and his son and daughter.

Three years ago we found out my father had an affair and he had a kid who was 3 years old at the time. My mom ended their marriage and my father moved in with the affair partner and married her once the divorce from mom was finalized. My sister and I were already done with our relationship. She had to spend custody time with him for a year and was around his wife (before she was his wife) and his other daughter in that time but then she ended all contact when the courts gave her permission. I needed to go to him for custody until last year when the courts let me stop it. And I did stop it.

His daughter was really confused by it all. She was told my sister and I were her siblings but we did not make an effort to know her or be in her life. My father and her mother pumped her full of hope that we'd be close. My sister and I want no relationship.

Now my father's wife brings her daughter to my football games and she has shown up to dance competitions I take part in too. Her daughter gets so excited to see me but I never want to see her at them. I try to be nice but I'd rather not talk to her at all. My father showed up once or twice too. When I ignore them I see how much it hurts the kid. She saw my sister last month when I had a dance thing and my sister refused to look over their way and left as soon as she could. I could see my father's daughter crying... and yes I know she's technically my half sister, I have no love for her, no interest in being her brother, no wish to have a family life with her. I don't blame her. I blame him. But she means nothing to me. So I call her my father's daughter instead.

My father knows. And after the dance thing last month I reached out to him for the first time in a year and I told him he should try being a better dad to her and stop letting these games be played. I told him we'll never want her and he knows that. So he should protect her and focus on giving her a good life instead of putting us in the position to be dicks and ignore her or to make her more hopeful. He ranted and raved at me that we made him sound like a worse dad than he was to us and he said my sister and I are no better because we have a responsibility to our younger sibling. I quickly told him that we did not make her, choose her or accept any responsibility for her. But he made us which made him responsible. And that's why he should do better. I had to end the call and block him because he went crazy down the phone at me.

But he saw me when I was out with friends and he ranted at me some more and told me I shouldn't have said what I did.

My mom ended their marriage and my father moved in with the affair partner and married her once the divorce from mom was finalized. My sister and I were already done with our relationship. She had to spend custody time with him for a year and was around his wife (before she was his wife) and his other daughter in that time but then she ended all contact when the courts gave her permission. I needed to go to him for custody until last year when the courts let me stop it. And I did stop it.

His daughter was really confused by it all. She was told my sister and I were her siblings but we did not make an effort to know her or be in her life. My father and her mother pumped her full of hope that we'd be close. My sister and I want no relationship.

Now my father's wife brings her daughter to my football games and she has shown up to dance competitions I take part in too. Her daughter gets so excited to see me but I never want to see her at them. I try to be nice but I'd rather not talk to her at all. My father showed up once or twice too. When I ignore them I see how much it hurts the kid. She saw my sister last month when I had a dance thing and my sister refused to look over their way and left as soon as she could. I could see my father's daughter crying... and yes I know she's technically my half sister, I have no love for her, no interest in being her brother, no wish to have a family life with her. I don't blame her. I blame him. But she means nothing to me. So I call her my father's daughter instead.

My father knows. And after the dance thing last month I reached out to him for the first time in a year and I told him he should try being a better dad to her and stop letting these games be played. I told him we'll never want her and he knows that. So he should protect her and focus on giving her a good life instead of putting us in the position to be dicks and ignore her or to make her more hopeful. He ranted and raved at me that we made him sound like a worse dad than he was to us and he said my sister and I are no better because we have a responsibility to our younger sibling. I quickly told him that we did not make her, choose her or accept any responsibility for her. But he made us which made him responsible. And that's why he should do better. I had to end the call and block him because he went crazy down the phone at me.

But he saw me when I was out with friends and he ranted at me some more and told me I shouldn't have said what I did.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I 32m have recently become exclusive partners with Sally 34f (not her real name). Sally and I were seeing each other for a few months before deciding to go exclusive. During this time I know she was seeing two other men casually, however neither of then were really relationship type for her. Once we became exclusive she notified both of the other guys and stopped seeing them.

Just recently one of these guys has reached out to her, asking if they can hang out and watch a movie together. Sally didn't give an answer but came to me asking about it, thinking that if he comes over to her place where she lives with her sister then it shouldn't be an issue. Sally is wary that this guys' intentions might be to try to make a move on her, so she thinks that if her sister is also present then it would negate that.

Sally and this guy met through a dating app, there was no friendship before they were hooking up. 

Sally believes that this guy doesn't have many friends that he can hang out and watch movies with, and believes that they should be able to get along as friends.

AITA for not feeling comfortable about this situation and wanting to say no? Even writing it out and reading it back makes me more uncomfortable with it. I also don't like being put in the situation to deny her, I know that if the roles were reversed I wouldn't think about bringing it up. I wouldn't even want to do it.

125,1dk5tgm,AITA for refusing to pay for my siblings tutoring?,"I’m 19, almost 20, and working a minimum wage job that brings in about $130 weekly.

My parents have strict rules: I must be home before dark and can only leave for classes or work. To hang out with friends, I lie and say I’m at college. I also share a room with my sibling.

I’ve always followed these rules because I live at home rent-free and felt it was the least I could do.

Recently, my dad asked me to contribute to household expenses, so now I pay him $330 USD every three months for bills.

On top of that, I’ve been giving my mom $100 a month for my sibling’s religious tutoring. I’m not religious, but I considered this my “rent” and didn’t mind it until I started paying the gas bill. 

Now, I feel like I’m being double-charged. When my mom asked for the tutoring money again, I told her I couldn’t afford it anymore. She argued that the gas bill arrangement with my dad was separate and I still needed to pay for the tutoring.

I also feel like I’m basically paying rent without the freedom of living alone. I still have to abide by their strict rules and can’t do as I please. My dad still treats me like a child and occasionally comes in my room to make sure that I’m not playing games (he’s strangely strict about me playing online games). 

I don’t think my parents are considering my future. My dad even said, “You can pay the bills, right? It’s not like you’re saving up for anything.” I’m currently in college, funding my education with student loans that I’ll have to repay myself. They aren’t helping me with tuition or any other expenses.

To make matters worse, my dad earns a decent salary as a senior nurse, but most of his income goes overseas to support extended family and my aunt’s medical school tuition.

I can see how I might be the asshole as an additional $100 might not be too unreasonable.

She works at a salad bar and always gives me free salads so this is where I am thinking I could possibly be the AH. 

I often sell her clothes (I run a small fashion business) and often have to chase her up numerous times to pay me for what she buys. 

Last night we went to a food market and the queues were huge. There was a big group of us and we all split up to order. I got a call from one of the other girls she was with in the queue saying that this girl wanted me to order the food I was in line for her for. It cost $18 (aud) so admittedly nothing crazy but then I also got the taxi home ($3 each so really nothing) but it’s still the principle. 

So my question is AITA for calling her out? Should I let it slide this time and then just not be as kind next time?

I f25 have a decent paying job and I have this ‘friend’ who I know mainly through my flatmate who is terrible at paying me back or even offering to pay for things. 

She works at a salad bar and always gives me free salads so this is where I am thinking I could possibly be the AH. 

I often sell her clothes (I run a small fashion business) and often have to chase her up numerous times to pay me for what she buys. 

Last night we went to a food market and the queues were huge. There was a big group of us and we all split up to order. I got a call from one of the other girls she was with in the queue saying that this girl wanted me to order the food I was in line for her for. It cost $18 (aud) so admittedly nothing crazy but then I also got the taxi home ($3 each so really nothing) but it’s still the principle. 

So my question is AITA for calling her out? Should I let it slide this time and then just not be as kind next time? I am by no means rich and just feel annoyed when all my other friends are so on top of paying for things / always like I will get this one and you next. With her she has never offered to pay.

132,1dk3ssi,AITA for distancing and attempt at being independent from my mom for intruding on my privacy and basically controlling me?,"Hello! I (15m) have the standard Asian parents who have incredibly high expectations for me. My mom (39f) controls everything I do and places many restrictions on me. She expects me to go to a top-tier university and focus entirely on achieving this. 

One thing that I have always hated was the way she disregards my privacy. She has my phone on complete lockdown with screen time limits and everything. I understand that this is normal but my mom doesn't stop there. She goes through every text and message I send that day and reads it. She even responds to some texts with friends or tutors for me. Even when I ask her not to snoop into my messages she always does. It is almost like she finds it exciting. The main problem I have with it is that she thinks I talk too much to this person and I should say this and not that. She limits how much I can text people and talk to them. I am a very sociable person and I feel the need to socialize with others. 

My mom keeps me cooped up in front of the computer doing courses, research, and anything she tells me to do. I don't have a say in this. Whenever I confront her or get mad about it, she always yells at me about how I am doing all this stuff for myself and not for her so I should be trying harder. Sometimes I need a break but she refuses to let me stop ""working towards my goals"". I got off of work(9-5) and was exhausted that day so I was tired and told her I couldn't work on stuff anymore. She goes on to rant about how I need to get research done over the summer so it looks good for colleges. 

So I stayed up late to do computer modeling and my mom was pressing me to do my research even though I told her I didn't want to do it. I finished my model and set up the print and I logged into Instagram and responded to my friends. As I was doing this, my mom was on Instagram on my phone and reading my messages. She got super pissed off that I was on Instagram instead of research like I told her. She told me that she didn't expect any better of me and that I could just go to \*insert state college"" instead. She said that I wasted all my time goofing off instead of focusing on my future and called me a failure. 

That's when I snapped. As soon as they went to bed, I logged into my mom's accounts forcefully removed all parental supervision, and locked all my accounts from her so that she could read my emails, texts, or messages. I changed the password of all my devices. She woke up the next morning and yelled at me at the top of her lungs for half and hour before I had to leave for work. So I told her to never tell me what to do again and cut her from everything I do.

 I made sure everything was on my own accord and made my decisions independently of my mom. It finally felt like I had some freedom in my life. I am trying to cut her from most things I do. She is either yelling at me or giving me the silent treatment and threatening to take all my devices/belongings away so I won't have anything to do but study.

133,1dk3jwx,AITA for telling my husband he sounds rude when he tells stories?,"Let me lead with my husband (34M) and I (26F) have a great relationship. Rarely do we ever fight and we are able to openly talk to each other about difficult subjects. 

Recently while driving home from the store we passed a company that treated my husband like crap in an interview. This happened years ago but grinds his gears when he thinks about it (valid. The interviewer was horrid.) 

While he was talking about it I asked if he knew how old the interviewer was (or how old he looked) and my husband snapped at me saying “no why would I know that” in a pretty rude tone. Now I’m used to my husband as when he’s going through emotions he has a hard time coming down from them. Basically if he was telling you any story when he was upset at the situation it would sound like he was mad at you but he isn’t. I like to call it a vivid storyteller. 

Most of the time when it happens I understand he’s not actually upset with me he’s just in the heat of the memory but it does get to me sometimes. I told him he didn’t have to speak to me that way and he said he was sorry and he didn’t mean to. I then proceeded to tell him that he does that a lot where he’ll speak rudely without meaning to because his mom has brought it up as well. My husband got sad because he really doesn’t mean to do that to others but doesn’t realize when he does. I told him he needs to try and be aware of it when talking about things that upset him because that could be the reason people in his life suddenly become upset with him (he’s brought it up multiple times that people will randomly start not liking him and he has no idea why. Usually coworkers) and it made him feel like shit. 

So basically AITA for telling my husband he sounds rude to people when he tells upsetting stories because his emotions spill over?

P.S. he doesn’t seem upset with me for saying it but he was pretty sad in the moment and it had me thinking if I should have even brought it up to him or if it was unnecessary.

134,1dk3jpq,AITAH If i let my phone die when i went to the bar?,"I (26M) went to a chilis tonight to watch my team play baseball against the Texas A&M. 

When I got home, I saw a text from my Sister telling me to call right away. She has a 3 year old with some health issues so when I saw the text, I called her and she mentioned that my girlfriend (F25) wanted to call and was asking if she got an error when calling. 

I called my gf and told her that my phone had been dead. She stated the call MAD. She is generally anxious (not like diagnosed but we both agree she has it, don’t have the money for a real psychiatrist but she is in therapy) and was really upset. I was genuinely shocked, I had called her when walking less than a quarter mile to the restaurant (less than a block along a road the rest is walking through a parking lot). I had also been texting her mentioning the strange decoration and the man I had sat next to at the bar, keeping her engaged and in the know. My phone died around 9:40 EST- and I was home by 11:40 EST and charged up by 12:15AM when I called her- 1:35 of time “dead”. 

She said my location share wasn’t working and my phone was going to voicemail. She called my 2 sisters and they did nothing to calm her down.

The problem is she brought up how this was a fight in the past in college. We were dating in the last years of college and I had gone out with friends and told her I’d be home around 12 but didn’t make it back until later - around 2. After that we had a fight and i remember saying that I would try to make sure I kept her as up to date as possible as she had no idea where I was and I didn’t want to hurt her anxiety/ make her worried.

But this feels different- I was unavailable for such a short amount of time and she really seems more mad than I’ve seen in a long time of dating (almost 5 years)

So I guess AITAH? I can answer any questions as needed. Maybe I’m just apathetic.

I also want to mention quickly in case anyone might wonder about the Bar part- I don’t have cable so I needed somewhere to see it and I also don’t drink, only had Diet Coke the whole time. So it’s not something deeper like that. We are also medium distance as we live around an hour apart due to jobs in different cities.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITAH If i let my phone die when i went to the bar?

I missed 2 very important things and I have to present them by tomorrow but I’m still clueless on what I have to do until now because again, she’s inconsiderate. me and my mom do not have a good relationship because she is a narcissist. 

anyway, she called my dad and started ranting. obviously I had done this before her and he witnessed everything that happened in the car so he told her that he understood where I was coming from. when he said this my mom went batshit crazy and started yelling, which I don’t understand. she talked about how “i’m her biggest problem” and “i’m a demon” when I didn’t even answer her back. I was just ignoring her the whole time she was pissed at me for showing emotion. my mom LOVES to overreact when she sees someone unhappy about something she has done. she will turn it into a big problem, so my dad continously teaches me to not show her how i feel which I find unfair, since I should not be adjusting for her behavior.

i became transparent with my coach telling him what my mom had done in hopes that he would extend the deadline of the things I have to present. i don’t know if that was an asshole move, but my mom certainly deserves it. i am sick of her putting up that “perfect mom” bullshit whenever her friends are around.

Any advice she gives is the most surface level stuff that we already thought of, and she doesn't know enough to know that she doesn't know what she's talking about.

My brother and his wife (my sister in law) have been having some problems in their marriage about when to have kids. My brother doesn't like the idea of being a super old dad and wants it to be now. My SIL has a good thing going with her career and wants to wait some years. She's only 26 so it's not like the clock is ticking particularly loud at this point.

My sister and I are close with our SIL so she floated the idea of asking my mom for advice to me, since in her view, my mom raised 3 kids that turned out ok and she likes. I explained to her why my mom's bad at giving advice and that I'd found more success doing the opposite of what she says.

Well my SIL talked to my mom anyway and let it slip that I said all of that. And yes, my SIL did acknowledge that she received horrible advice about how no mothers care about their career once their first child is born so she might as well get started early or something.

Anyway, my mom is mad at me for saying all of that, and I feel bad for hurting her feelings. At the same time, though, I think it was worth mentioning because I think it'd be pretty jarring to receive advice like that on such a sensitive topic with no warning.

140,1dk31tw,WIBTA If I Don't Cancel Pre-Existing Work To Attend My Boyfriend's Dad's Funeral?,"My (20) boyfriend (M20)'s dad passed away on Sunday. Understandably, he's struggling with it, and as I lost family last year, I understand what it's like, so I've been giving him grace, buying groceries/gas, cooking for him, etcetera for the past few days.

The issue arises because I, as a college student, have a small business where I petsit for people. I have a client who I have had for several years who pays well, and asked me well over a month ago to take care of her house and animals around the 4th of July. This was obviously before his dad passed away. I also work around 30 hours a week for a decent wage.

The funeral has been planned for while I cannot go, as it is within the time I have already committed to house sit, and with it being within a week, it would be basically impossible for them to find someone on such short notice. I was all for going as long as his family and he wanted me to go (we recently, in the last month, went to his home state for a week to visit them, and his father has been dealing with various health issues for a long time. When planning the trip, there was an unspoken 'while we still can see him'. Since we recently took a trip, my savings are basically gone. I don't have the money for a plane ticket in the first place.). Also, when this ordeal started, I went over to his apartment to try to talk to him in person about it. He was on the phone with one of his dad's siblings, who I have met before, who told him that it would likely be best to leave me behind, so that he could focus on supporting his mother and siblings. (Genuinely not a case of his family/this relative not liking me, at least to my knowledge, but because if I came along, it would probably be harder for him to give his immediate family the support that they need right now.)

My boyfriend seems to be seeing it as me picking petsitting over his dad's funeral, without taking the other factors, such as money, into account. To take this trip, I would miss out on over $1,000 of much needed money, as well as spending what I do have at the moment on my plane ticket (which alone is about $1,000 that I do not have lying around - it would have to go on a credit card or be loaned to me by my parents, who are aware of what's going on). This isn't even accounting for other expenses. As I told him, if it was not within the 9-day period of time that I had already committed to a job, I would go in a heartbeat, even if it was going to take every dollar I had left. I see where he's coming from, but I also don't think he's actually thought about how this trip would impact me financially. I may be the asshole here because I am not really willing to cancel the job I already took on and put myself into debt to go to his dad's funeral.

141,1dk31cb,AITAO for being jealous of my (now ex) girlfriend’s gay best friend?,"My girlfriend and I had been together for a little less than a year, and she went to school far enough away to where we were still considered long-distance, but she could visit on the weekends occasionally. Throughout our relationship, she got closer and closer to her guy best friend (let’s call him Dave). Dave didn’t really have that many friends, and neither did she, so I knew better than to be jealous of their closeness alone. They were closer than I was with her in some ways, but different people have different levels of connection in different areas. My issue was how involved he was becoming in our relationship. At first, I noticed that he and her were commenting on each other’s Instagram posts with things like “OMG SO SEXY” and “I LOVE YOU,” and while I kinda wished I got that same energy from her, I understand that friends are going to hype each other up, so it wasn’t a huge deal. But one day, when she and I were on a facetime call, the camera went to him, and he was wearing the hoodie I let her borrow. I expressed my discomfort with him wearing my clothes and said it would have been fine if she had asked, but it felt like she was treating the sweater as her own. She called me controlling, but I didn’t feel out of line in wanting her to respect my belongings, especially since that sweater had significant meaning for us. I brushed this off because it was literally just a sweater, and it wasn’t worth making her upset. Later on, when I visited her one weekend, I bought us a bottle of wine so that she and I could have a movie night and wine glasses together, and he ended up being invited to share the wine with us. She had asked if I was comfortable with this, but I felt forced to say yes because I knew she would have taken it personally if I had said no. In hindsight, I probably could have stood my ground and said, “I would prefer for this night to be just us,” but she was making it seem like we would be abandoning him if we didn’t invite him, so I didn’t feel like I had much of a choice in the moment. Over time, I felt more and more like she wanted me to be a straight version of him because they had a sort of chemistry that she and I were lacking, and she often spoke to me or treated me in the same way that she did to him expecting a similar response from me. I understand that I wasn’t the only important person in her life, but it felt like he was coming between us, and whenever I’d express my feelings about this to her, I was called controlling. I ended up breaking up with her because she didn’t know how to handle conflict without shifting all the blame onto me (I’ve talked to multiple people who knew her, and they all agree that she does this in all of her relationships), and we just needed things from each other that neither of us were capable of providing.",Not enough info,2024-06-20,"AITAO for being jealous of my (now ex) girlfriend’s gay best friend?

142,1dk2xgf,AITA: I don’t want my mom or grandma at my graduation ,"So for context, my dad passed away in 2020 due to a health condition he had. I was 16 at the time. My dad was always my biggest and only support system. He was the only one that ever encouraged me to do anything or simply told me that he was proud of me. After he passed I wrongfully assumed that my mom and his mom would pick up his slack. I though that they would be there to support be since he no longer was. His death of course affected my entire life, including school. I went from a 4.0 gpa to basically dropping out. My mom let me bed rot basically all junior and senior year, and my grandma simply just never called to check on me. I was stuck in a cycle of depression and grief for about 2 years. Despite everything, I ended up getting my ged last year and immediately started classes at a community college. I did that. I pulled my self out of my grief and put myself back on track with absolutely no help from anyone. Now I am 20 and will be graduating within a year or 2 and I randomly had the thought that I don’t want my mom or grandma at my graduation. The thought of them in the crowd smiling, cheering, bragging about me on Facebook makes me absolutely disgusted. Why should they partake in the joy they had absolutely no hand in making sure I achieved? The only one that deserves to be in the crowd with a proud smile once my name is called is my dad.

EDIT: I originally wrote this when my mind wasn’t the clearest so there are missing details, sorry. My parents were not married or romantically involved at all. They had their problems but were cordial sometimes. Outside of the shock of him actually being gone my mom did not really go through any grieving. My grandma on the other hand would only ever check to see how I was doing in school and once I told her that I stopped going because I was struggling with my mental health she just kind of checked out on me. Before my dad died I was the stereotypical golden/gifted child that got good grades, the student all the teachers loved, never misbehaving etc. and then I went through burn out along with my grief. My grandma was also hurting yes but I don’t think that justifies practically ghosting your only grandchild bc they aren’t something to be proud of anymore.

143,1dk2sue,WIBTA if I do not contact someone I saved a kitten with?,"Last night there was a litter of kittens stuck in an awning/facade off the side of an abandoned building next door to me (~8-9ft high). The likely mother of the litter had been run over a few days ago, so these kittens were likely to die if no intervention was taken. A group of neighbors saw these kittens and got animal control and the fire department to come out and get them to safety. The fire department got 4/5 of the kittens, claimed they couldn’t find the last one, and left. Animal control left with the four kittens that had been captured. 

We of course couldn’t let the last one be stuck up there, so we took it upon ourselves to get her down. I had grabbed a chair from my apartment and used my phone camera as eyes as I wasn’t tall enough to look through the facade. After a while of searching I was able to spot the last kitten and get her out of her hiding spot.  One woman, I’ll fake name her Jill, was able to finally get this last kitten down after she found a ladder. 

When most people left, it was between Jill and I to take little kitty home. Throughout the whole process, Jill was very adamant about bringing a kitten home. She had even given the animal control person some trouble when he said he had to intake the kittens and she couldn’t just take them home with her. I do have doubts of her ability to take care of cats, especially feral one month old kittens, so I was nervous to let her take her home. Jill was going out of town today so it was a good excuse that I would take kitty for now and I would update her. I have her number but she does not have mine. I have yet to contact her. She does know where I live

Why I have not contacted Jill is because I hope she will lose interest in keeping this kitten for herself. Why I do not trust her:
1. Did not understand why animal control wouldn’t let just anyone take these kittens home (i.e., they need shots, spay/neuter, socialization, etc.) I feel like she wanted this kitten just because kittens are cute and she had a hero’s story
2. If she were to take this kitten, would she actually do the aforementioned things? Feral kittens take a good amount of time, money, knowledge, and patience to raise
3. Thought bread was acceptable food (~1mo old kitten here)
4. Let kitten get rained on and didn’t see a problem with it (potential for hypothermia)

Kitty is with me, giving her time to decompress but checking in often, making sure she eats, poops, and is warm. She is still scared of me, but I am bribing her love with milk replacement and treats. I am waiting to hear back on vet appointments so we can go asap. I do intend to keep little kitty, as I love cats

Additionally, I knew literally nothing about Tom other than what I mentioned before, so I had no reason to think there were any major differences between Tom and Paloma.

I told her where to find it since I had packaged all my american girl doll things up high in my closet so my sister wouldn’t be able to touch it while I was away. I was told that they would put the doll and the stuff back after the party. I didn’t want my sister to feel left out as all the other girls at the party had american girl dolls- a specific brand of doll that was expensive. My sister has an insane amount of dolls and toys that fill up both her room and our entire living room. She goes through toys like crazy and is always wanting the next new thing she sees on her ipad (she’s had an ipad since she was 3).
 
I was obsessed with this particular doll from 1st grade to 5th grade and wouldn’t play with or ask for any other toys. I would set it next to me in bed so I could sleep with it without squishing it and did a crazy amount of research as an 8 year old on how to keep it in perfect condition. I learned how to sew to make clothes for it since the brand’s clothes were extremely expensive. 

I came back home a month later and see my doll in the living room amongst all her other toys and dolls. I found the glasses and clothes for it strewn all over her mess of toys and the doll’s hair completed knotted. I asked to take my doll back just because it had so much sentimental value to me and I didn’t want to see it get messed up. My mother said I was being unreasonable and selfish since I wanted my doll to sit in my room while my little sister wanted to play with it.

146,1dk27db,AITA for Refusing to Pay for Father's Day Dinner?,"Hi all, I don't think I'm the asshole here, but it's hard not to feel like one when my mom definitely believes that's the case, while my dad doesn't even know it happened. For context, I (24F) live alone while my (19M) brother lives at home.

My mom texted me 3 days before father's day and told me that she was taking my dad and the family (4 adults, 1 child) out to dinner at a fancy restaurant and she wanted me and my brother to split the bill for it. She said it'd be nice for my dad not to pay for it himself and that since we're both working adults, it's appropriate for us to pull some financial labor for our parents.

I told her I'd think about it, and discuss with my brother. I called my brother and he told me that he was trying to save up to move out of the house, and my mom already borrowed money from him to help fund her business. My dad earns ~140k a year and mom has not worked for 10+ years. Recently she decided to start a business on Facebook, which has seen some success, but not enough to break even yet.

I felt it wasn't right to ask my little brother, who makes ~28k a year and was already contributing financially to also help pay for dinner. However that was a problem for me, as I make ~30k a year, 100% self supporting, and saving for car repairs. In short, I didn't think I could afford it. So I thought up some alternatives and told my mom that while I couldn't pay for dinner I'd be happy to buy groceries and cook for them or to pay for my own meal.

My mom told me that groceries would cost just as much as a restaurant and I was being difficult on purpose. When I held my ground she backtracked and told me paying for my own meal was fine, but she hopes I plan better in the future. Overall, I thought the conversation went well.

Later I got some texts from my brother, as mom asked him to cover the dinner anyways. When he refused she yelled at him for ganging up on her with me. She told him that since I didn't do anything for her on Mother's day she just didn't want that to happen to Dad. Now, I did have to work on Mother's day, and I can understand if she was still upset about that. In my defense, I did call her to wish her well on the day, and I went up there later in the week with gifts and a card for her. 

Things were a bit tense during Father's day dinner, though my dad did seem happy. At the end I sent my mom the money for my food so we didn't have to split the check and my mom made a big deal of it. My dad was confused and told me that while he appreciated me contributing, he didn't mind paying since he knows it's hard supporting myself and he appreciates that I was able to come at all. (Ly dad)

My mom's been ticked off ever since, I struggle a lot with keeping healthy boundaries with her, and I felt like this was a major step forward for me. She keeps implying that it's my fault that I don't have that much money to spend and that I'm refusing to go along with things out of spite. I'm tired of all the games, am I the asshole here?

148,1dk24fp,AITA for cooking meat at night when my upstairs neighbor can smell it?,"2 years ago I bought a condo in a small 100-year-old brick apartment building. We're mainly owners, with a few rentals. We're careful about noise because the sound insulation isn't great - there's also no smoking pot or tobacco because it stinks. We're all generally on polite acquaintance terms with each other, and do our best to get along.

I work late sometimes, and I like to exercise after work, so sometimes I cook dinner late. A month ago, I'm searing a venison steak at about 10pm, kitchen fan on, kitchen door (that leads to the back stairs) open, when some guy shows up. The following ensues.

Him: \[awkwardly aggressively\] ""I live upstairs and I can smell what you're cooking.""

Me: \[thinking 'is he asking for some?'\] ""...oookay?""

Him: ""It's just, our bedroom is right above here and we can smell it.""

Me: ""Ok, well, hello, I'm \[name\], I live here, I don't think we've met, did you just move into the above apartment?""

Him: ""No, we’ve been here a few years.  I'm \[name\] my girlfriend is \[name\]. I just wanted to tell you that we can smell it in our bedroom.” 

Me: ""...ok?”

Him: …

Me: …

Him: “Maybe I can figure out how the vents work in my apartment so less smell travels up.""

Me: ""...ok. Duly noted.""

Then he leaves.

Yesterday is another late night, another venison steak, and yet again, this guy shows up to knock on the kitchen door.

Him: ""Ok, I realize that you need to eat, but we can smell the food in our bedroom - it's right above the kitchen.""

Me: \[Thinking: Actually, your bedroom isn't above the kitchen, it's above MY bedroom, and smell may travel up, but bouncy noises travel down - so how about you don't come down here to bang on my door and tell me you can smell my food, and I won't go up and bang on your door to tell you I can hear you fuck?\]

Me: “Oh.  Ok.  Did you ever do that vent thing you were talking about?”

He repeats a few times that he can smell what I’m cooking before dramatically going “I guess I’ll just pull a wall out” and leaving.

Pro:

\* I believe in being a good neighbor.  I’m quiet, always let someone use my parking space if I’m out of town on a trip, I remember my neighbor’s names and pets, and if I meet them I always say hi and ask after pets/partners.  I support the smoking ban.  I hate the idea of being the asshole neighbor. 

\* He’s an owner so he’s probably not leaving.  I like my place and I got my mortgage rate during covid, I am NOT leaving – so we really should try to get along.

Con:

\* It annoys me that he won’t even ask for anything (not that there’s anything reasonable he CAN ask) and just keeps repeating “I can smell what you’re cooking.” 

\* The guy below me cooks bacon and cookies at ALL the wrong times and I shrug it off. 

\* If I was roasting a bushel of hot peppers or pickling fish, that'd be one thing, but this is plain food – just meat plus heat.

I think she acts like it's still her doing most of the work.

151,1dk1oim,AITA for yelling at my drunk friend?,"The other weekend, I (18 F) went to my town's annual carnival, a tradition marking the start of summer where people often drink heavily, including myself lol. While hanging out with friends (ages 16-18), I spotted John (fake name, 18 M), one of my best friends of almost three years. He dresses in late 70s/early 80s style with leather (pants, a red silk shirt, and curly hair.\_

Excited to see him, I hurried over to compliment his outfit and hair. However, to my surprise, he began yelling at me, which was completely out of character. He called several things that I would never imagine him calling me.

Here's where I might be at fault: The day before, John had texted me to meet at our town's coffee shop, but I had a presentation that day worth 20% of my grade that I hadn't started. I apologized and explained I couldn't make it. He seemed understanding at the time.

When he started yelling at the carnival, I was taken aback. He accused me of abandoning him at the coffee shop where he waited due to his dad's appointment, even though he was there for only about 75 minutes. I defended myself, reminding him about my project. After I explained myself, John mentioned he's now working. I genuinely congratulated him, something I'd encouraged for months. But he lashed out, accusing me of only caring because he might buy me things. I assured him I was happy for his progress and that he wasn't isolating himself anymore.

His rant continued, filled with demeaning insults like ""b\*tch,"" ""slut,"" and worse. I told him off, demanding he stop and think before speaking. His excuse? ""I'm f\*cking drunk, what do you expect""

At this point I was done, and I told him I expected him ""not to act like a f\*cking c\*nt"" and walked away.

I found how he spoke to me to be unacceptable. We have been drunk together before, and neither of us have talked to eachother that way. I was especially shocked because he knows how I feel about people (especially men) calling me and other women those things.

About an hour later him and some mutual friends came over. He smelled more like booze than before and he blurted out a half-hearted ""sorry"". I told him to talk to me when he sobered up. It's been over two weeks since this happened and the most I've gotten was a ""Hi"" when we ran into eachother at the store.

When he started yelling at the carnival, I was taken aback. He accused me of abandoning him at the coffee shop where he waited due to his dad's appointment, even though he was there for only about 75 minutes. I defended myself, reminding him about my project. After I explained myself, John mentioned he's now working. I genuinely congratulated him, something I'd encouraged for months. But he lashed out, accusing me of only caring because he might buy me things. I assured him I was happy for his progress and that he wasn't isolating himself anymore.

His rant continued, filled with demeaning insults like ""b\*tch,"" ""slut,"" and worse. I told him off, demanding he stop and think before speaking. His excuse? ""I'm f\*cking drunk, what do you expect""

At this point I was done, and I told him I expected him ""not to act like a f\*cking c\*nt"" and walked away.

I found how he spoke to me to be unacceptable. We have been drunk together before, and neither of us have talked to eachother that way. I was especially shocked because he knows how I feel about people (especially men) calling me and other women those things.

About an hour later him and some mutual friends came over. He smelled more like booze than before and he blurted out a half-hearted ""sorry"". I told him to talk to me when he sobered up. It's been over two weeks since this happened and the most I've gotten was a ""Hi"" when we ran into eachother at the store.

152,1dk1mo8,AITA for refusing to take my father's friend's son to Comicon. ," We'll call him Joseph. 

I(36m) have been going to the London Comicon for about 15 years, missed a few during Covid but back to going twice a year. Joseph(30m) started going with me a few years back. His father told my parents that Joserph liked the stuff he was seeing on my facebook and was wanting to go. He attended a few Comicon with me but after the last one we attended together, no more. I'll be fair, he has Aspergers but I think even with that he does not deserve to come with me again after what I'm about to say.

We don't live near London. I usually arrange everything for the trip, Travel and hotel, then he is expected to pay half, I'll say the first point, his dad gives him a wad of spending money, he could have paid me out of that and still had, probably more than the average Comicon guest, but he chose to hold on and pay after the event. Selfish but that's a drop in a bucket compared to why I'm not taking him.

Last year I had things arranged, I told him when I wanted to go, a couple of hours before our bus was set to leave, He sent a message back asking why I wanted to go early. Hey, it's better to be an hour early than a minute late, the bus station was a bit away from us, my plan was to drive their, leave my car at my friend's house(Not Joseph) and walk to the station. My plan would have given us plenty of time to do this. I got to Joseph's house to pick him up at the time I'd told him, and he wasn't ready, nothing was printed, nothing was packed. He was messing about getting ready. He took literally 2 hours, by the end of it we needed to get his brother to give us a lift to the station. I'll be honest, I wish I'd just gone without him, Maybe given him 15 minutes grace time, told him, ""I'm going at quarter past, you can come with me as you are then or make your own way.""

Not part of the reason I'm not taking him, but after we got back from the Comicon, he actually complained about needing to pay to get the bus back from town, if he'd been ready when I told him my car would have been in town and we'd have gone back in that.

And

The Comicon is a 3 day event, Friday/Saturday/Sunday, I happened to have something on on Saturday morning. I had a full weekend ticket, Joseph had a Friday and Sunday ticket and pressured me to swap. I truly wish I'd put my foot down and refused point blank. That was a fucking selfish request on his part. I could have gone in the afternoon on Saturday

So the event was on again in May, he wanted to go, I said he could go but he'll need too arrange his own transport, accommodation and whatever ticket he orders, that is the one he'll be using. When asked why I told him that that last time I needed to change plans and cancel things for him and that it was selfish to pressure me to swap tickets.



So I booked a hotel for one, went down on my own, had a great time, Now him and his parents think I'm TA",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for refusing to take my father's friend's son to Comicon.   We'll call him Joseph.

153,1dk1ln5,AITA for not letting my daughter work? ,"
My (56M) daughter (19F) started going to college last year and everyone asks her all the time when she's going to start working, and when she says that I give her money and that I pay for all her things, most of them tell her that that's wrong and that I'm not helping her mature. 

The thing is, I met my wife (39F) when she was studying and working at the same time and I know that life was  REALLY hard for her, and neither she nor I want that for our daughters (18F 16F 10F). So we both decided that we don't want her to work while she is studying, Obviously she earns money by helping her mother with some things at work, or sometimes she helps me or takes care of her siblings for a few hours so that her mother and I can go out, and with those little things she earns a good amount of money. Because we want her, even if she doesn't have a formal job, to learn that money is earned with effort. 

The thing is that my in-laws think I'm being a shitty father who is raising a parasite (their words) that they forced my wife to work and study so that she could be a functional adult and that today she is successful thanks to that, and I know that is not the truth. She barely ate two meals a day when I met her and if she finished her studies it was because I paid most of her tuition, because she was studying a career that consumed all her time and the jobs she could get didn't pay much.  
And I want my daughter to study and for her only concern to be that, and so far it has worked because she is an exemplary student, so AITA for not letting her work?

EDIT: She is in med school and here in our country there are no jobs that she can do that are relevant to her future, there are days where she has classes from 7am until 6 or 7 pm and she needs to rest. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-20,"AITA for not letting my daughter work?

157,1dk0oyz,AITA for being p*ssed off about p*ss in my drinking cup?,"So my sister takes care of her son's baby.  Cute baby, I love the kid.  I am not blaming the kid for anything here, just to be clear.

I walk into the kitchen and I see one of my drinking cups on the table.  I had left it there earlier.

There's something in it.  I did not put this there.  It looks like urine.  I cautiously sniff, and of course it is urine.

There are only two culprits, and one of them wouldn't piss in a cup, but she was holding a baby who would happily piss anywhere.

My sister's on the phone, I wait for her to get off:

""Hey (name)...""

""Hey (my name), what's up?""

""Ok...is this piss?""

""...yeah...""

""(Name) this is a bridge too far.""

""I forgot that was there!""

""That's...(name), I would never put piss in a cup I know you drink out of.""

What followed was her getting upset and yelling at the baby for some reason.  I just turned and walked away, poured the piss in the toilet, and threw the cup away.  It was a cup I had for over 15 years.  It adds a bit to the annoyance here, but it's not the main reason I was for lack of a better term, pissed off.

I just think it's really disrespectful to pull something like that.  As I mentioned earlier, i wouldn't do that to her or anyone else.  Let the baby pee on the floor, or even your shirt, but don't pick up someone else's cup and have them piss in it. 

I only have a few cups I use, and I took the remaining ones out of the kitchen.  Maybe it's an overreaction, but I'm not sure I trust my sister to not do something like that again.
