0,1dl6mjt,AITA for doing school work on my dad‘s computer even though he said I could?,"I (m18) am a trans man who got my name changed through the colleges I’m in which I wasn’t allowed to do when I was in high school. For college I can just basically submit an application without having to get anything legally changed and that be OK. I have a laptop that I normally use for my schoolwork but it’s really old and stopped working about two months ago.. now that my college classes are started up for the summer courses I needed some thing pretty quick, so my father let me his laptop that he us now that my college classes are started up for the summer courses. I needed some thing pretty quick, so my father let me use his personal laptop, and he just kept the one that he used for work. 

I am about a month into my course so far and there was a couple assignments. I need to submit using Word which automatically puts my name that I have through the college in the file. I didn’t think anything of it and I could take it out because the assignment said specifically to keep it in. Abt a week ago, my dad needed his laptop back to get some photos off of it or something like that. When he was looking through the files, he found my assignments and he freaked out. he said I wasn’t allowed to do that on his computer and that I should be lucky that I’m allowed to use it in the first place and not disrespect him like that. I explained to him very calmly that he did not have a choice and that’s what the assignment asked for, and if I put my dead name on it, the professor would not know who it belonged to. he got mad and his urging me to change it back in the school, but I told him there was no point because by the full semester I would have it changed legally.

Gave the laptop back a couple days later when he was done with his photos and I kept doing my work like normal, but he still mad at me because I changed it in the system before I changed it legally.

I know I could have a very narrowminded view on this because I’m the one going through it but it’s not like I just came out a month ago. I came out almost a decade ago at this point and he knew about my name change at least eight years ago. He always refused to call me yet and still even now and after I would get it changed legally he said he would only use my initials , or some sort of nickname or something like that. Basically against it, and every single corner and every single aspect. I’m really grateful he let me use his laptop, but I don’t know where the point is where I should stop standing up for myself and being grateful that he let me use it or what to do. Now that I’m an adult and standing up for myself more because I can do more legally especially. I just don’t know where to draw that line because I am grateful but I can’t keep giving up who I am just for my father, especially because I would see that more than he ever would.

2,1dkscoa,AITA buying my step-daughter a used bridesmaid dress?,"I’m getting married in December of this year. I am bringing 2 daughters into this marriage. They’re 8 & 12. My fiance has a daughter from a previous marriage as well, Kiki (15). All 3 girls are in my wedding party, with Kiki as a bridesmaid. I’m letting all of my bridal party pick out their dresses, with the condition they’re all the same color and within a certain budget. I’m also paying for all of them. Kiki sent me a link to the dress she liked and I thought it was pretty. I planned on ordering it once I had the other members of the wedding party sending me what they wanted.

I was scrolling on Facebook one night and one of the buy/sell groups I’m apart of showed the dress that Kiki sent me. It was only used once in a wedding and is in perfect condition. You can’t even tell it was worn before. It also so happened to be in her size. So, I figured it’d be cheaper to buy this as it’s a dress she’ll likely also wear once and never again. The dress new online is $200. The person was selling it for $50 and just wanted it gone. I’ve seen the dress in person. No stains, no smells. Truly a steal. So, I bought it. 

When I told Kiki, she got mad and said she was the only one not getting a brand new dress. I pointed out I’m still getting her new shoes, accessories (again all of her choice), have alternations done to the dress as needed, she’ll have her hair and makeup done with us. If I found any other member of the bridal party’s dress in a similar condition and cheaper price in a Facebook group or a thrift store, I’d buy it. As it is, I’m spending about a grand on dresses for the 5 members of my bridal party. If I can save a little money, I will.

Kiki wants me to buy her the brand new dress. I spoke with my fiance and he agrees with me. We told Kiki if she wants the dress brand new, she can pay the difference. She’s still upset with us. Other members of my husband’s family feels I’m being a cheap ass and should just buy the dress new. AITA?

She picked up her underwear, but left a bunch of blood on the rug that was underneath. I immediately asked her to clean it completely, and she said that she would later. This made me really upset, because I think it's disgusting to just leave period blood on the carpet, and she was leaving for her dad's house in a few hours, so she didn't have much time. 30 minutes passed and she didn't clean it up, and I got really mad at her. I talked to my mom, but it seemed like she didn't care when she got it done, as long as she did. This made me even more mad tbh, bc atm I bathroom was pretty much out of order cus I wasn't using that shit. I kept bugging her abt it for an hour and even brought her hydrogen peroxide to clean it up. She didn't do it.
Her dad ended up coming to pick her up, and that shit was still there. I got so furious and went off on her about how disgusting she is, and how disrespectful she is being to my space. She called me sexist, and said I don't understand because I don't have a period. I get that having a period is hard, but cleaning up afterwards and being responsible about it seems like something she should have learned by 18 years old.

Two of her kids are the same age as mine (9 and 6) and we often have playdates. One day she invited my kids to a local indoor amusement park while I had to work. My kids were excited to go so we set the play date up. She informed me that it’d be 20 dollars for both kids to go to this park. I gave her 50 dollars in cash so it would cover admission plus arcade games or souvenirs my kids may want to get. I offered to pay for gas, but she politely declined. 

The day of this event, I get a text from Emma saying the kids spent more than the fifty bucks, and asked me for an additional 30 for reimbursement. I sent it to her without hesitation. Stuff is expensive. I get it. 
A couple hours later, she informed me they were headed back (it was about a half hour drive away), and she asks me for ANOTHER 20 dollars to cover the costs for McDonald’s. I thought it was weird, but again I sent it.

6,1dkre5e,AITA for refusing to raise my brothers child for him?,"I need to provide a little context: 

I was adopted by the people I consider my real parents when I was 7. My biological father is my adopted mother’s brother, and she adopted my sister and me from him because he’s a nut job. We were all raised with the knowledge that we were adopted. If i’m being honest, the notion of adoption isn’t really a thing in my culture as biological parenthood is very important. Families will just take in a child from an incompetent relative and raise them alongside their own children, but the child is always aware of who their biological parents are. The biological parents are usually involved as well but aren’t the child’s primary guardians and the child usually goes back to their biological parents once they’re more stable.

My younger brother (17M) is a little shit and he got his ex girlfriend pregnant. Furthermore, he cheated on her and she wants nothing to do with him. She figured out she was pregnant too late to get an abortion in our state and her parents won’t let her travel to get one. She wants nothing to do with my brother and our family and I can’t blame the poor girl.

Initially, my mother was going to take the baby and raise it, but obviously, considering how things are done in my culture, my mother was expecting my brothers ex to be involved. Even when my mother promised that she’d let her sign over parental responsibility and move on, she just didn’t seem genuine about it. 

The ex girlfriend decided to just speak to an adoption agency and adopt the baby out externally which upset my mom as you probably guessed why: blood is very important to her. 

My husband and I have been struggling to conceive so I offered to take the baby. But I explained that I would only do it if it was a real adoption, not like how my culture does it where I’d just be raising the baby for my brother. I made it clear that the baby wasn’t a toy to be passed around and that I wouldn’t be giving the child back when my brother finally gets his crap together in 15 years. My brothers ex was happy with this arrangement and we’ve been in the process of getting paperwork started.

Everyone in the family is pissed. They think I’m being unnecessary difficult by going against our cultural conventions just because i’m infertile and want a baby. My mother thinks that I’m being selfish because I was basically raised in the way I’m refusing to raise this child in and i’m being hypocritical. She thinks I should raise the kid with the knowledge of who their real parents are (which is something i’d share with them anyway when the time is right) and give my brother an opportunity to learn to be a father.

I don’t think i’m the AH but given the cultural perspective and the nature of my own upbringing, i’m starting to think i may be being a bit hypocritical.

For one, he is known to be a risk-taker and aggressive on the road as is, and I worry this will translate into him his biking. Some of his friends have bikes and they've taught him how to ride so he's confident this is what he wants. I think that having a motorcycle is already incredibly dangerous as is, and overall isn't worth the risk of getting hurt. You have no protection if you're in an accident, and I know several people who received life-altering injuries on a bike. 

As well, if he sells his car he becomes dependent on borrowing either his parents' cars or having me drive him anywhere we go and I think this will be generally inconvenient. 

So far, I have been very unsupportive of his decision, and he thinks that I'm an AH for not being there for him. I told him I don't want to have to constantly worry about his well-being - which I inevitably will if he does this.

So, a little bit of explanation before I get into it, so I met friend A about three years ago, who introduced me to group A, everyone in group A knows everyone through friend A, so he’s like the glue that holds it all together. It’s the same situation with friend b and group b, but recently I introduced group an and b together, and merged it into quite a big group of friends.

Now that’s been said, I can get into the mess that caused this, so I was out drinking with group a and friend A did a drunk toast thing, and said something along the lines of “here’s to my closest friend, my brother” and then said my name, which I was touched with the sentiment, but one of his other friends, who he has known for close to two decades, stormed off, friend A followed him outside, and they were out there arguing for like, 20 minutes, after a while, I followed them out, because I knew I was involved in whatever was going on. I didn’t want to butt my way in, so I just said “hey bro, I’m sorry if I’ve caused you any offence” and then left it at that. It seemed to get resolved shortly after I got back to our table, because they followed me back shortly after. 

Everything seemed ok until at the end of the night, me and the guy who got pissed before had fell behind the rest of the group as we were walking home, and he said to me that I was a manipulative snake because over the time he hadn’t been around, I’ve somehow became friend A closest friend, and said that I spout so much shit about loyalty to win people over.

I wasn’t trying to get into an argument with a close friend of my best friend, so I said that I’m sorry he felt that way, and didn’t mention it to my friends. I personally saw it as him being self conscious, until I heard that he had talked to a couple guys from group B and they thought the exact same way about me and friend B.

So now I feel odd, because I didn’t think I was really in the wrong at first, but quite a few people have agreed with him, friend a and b both have my back, but idk, i wouldn’t say I’m manipulative, I’m just endearing to those I care about, I make sure they can talk to me, I make sure they know they have my trust and loyalty etc, but it’s being spun like this is a bad thing.

So AITA? I’ve heard of the term love bombing, so is this a case of like, a friend version of that?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for ‘stealing’ my friends from their previous best friends This whole mess has caused a massive rift between my friend groups, I kinda just want peace but I need to know if I’m causing any of this or now.

So, a little bit of explanation before I get into it, so I met friend A about three years ago, who introduced me to group A, everyone in group A knows everyone through friend A, so he’s like the glue that holds it all together.

9,1dkquil,AITA My sunglasses got scratched,"Some context here.. I got two new pairs of Oakleys a few weeks ago(there was a sale LOL). This was my first time wearing one of the pairs, on the ten minute drive over to my friends house. I went into his apartment to greet him and ended up leaving them there, in mint condition. The sun was setting and we were heading downtown to a festival, I forgot them. 



Once I got home later that night, he texted me I forgot them and we agreed I'd get them ASAP. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I wasn't able to pick them up for over a week. When I finally get them back today, the lenses were super cloudy like they had been worn in the pool and my buddy mentioned he wore them a couple times. I'm thinking no big deal, I would want to wear them too. I noticed a small scratch on them immediately but didn't want an in-person confrontation. So waited until leaving to thoroughly clean/examine the sunglasses.



We were set to split some expenses on an upcoming concert. I texted him about the glasses and asked if he would offer any sort of compensation, and suggested perhaps anything towards the concert expenses. He said he thinks I am trying to scam him.. For some background on this friendship, I have known this person for a of couple years. We met at first in a professional capacity and became friends. Have gone on multiple road trips, we hang out frequently, go to concerts, etc and I helped him land the six figure job he has right now. 



I told him I'm not asking him for new glasses or new lenses, just asking would he offer anything for compensation? He won't take ownership or offer any apology. And he is mad at me saying I am trying to scam him. New lenses will cost me $80-100. I realize I left my sunglasses over at his apartment and see that if I had just remembered them, none of this would have happened.

10,1dkqkvl,AITA For wanting my wife to spend time with my family.,"Me 27M and my wife 27F are moving to Europe for work we'll be gone for 4 years them move back to the U.S after that. Before we leave, I have 30 days off of work, and my wife is also not working. We both want to spend time with our families before we leave. At first, she brought up how she would stay with her family for the whole 30 days, and I would stay with my family for the whole 30 days. But I was hesitant about this because we just got married and this is also considered my vacation time and I want to spend that time with my wife and both of our families equally.

At first, she was completely against this and said it was because she won't see her family in 4 years and wanted to spend as much time as possible with them. At first I understood this and It sort of made sense, but after awhile I thought that 30 days was a long time for both of us to not be working and to not vist both families with equal amount of time. So I brought up a compromise that we spend an equal amount of time with both families. At first, she was also against this idea but eventually agreed to do it.

Today, she messaged saying she's not going to my house during vacation, and she's just going to stay at home. She said she brought it up to her parents, and they agreed that we should both see our own families and that I'm being too controlling over what she does. This started a huge fight, which is where we're at now, so am I the asshole for trying to split this family time between both families?

While we were fighting, I brought up that I could be literally any amount of time with my family. we can choose how much time we spend with each family, but she said no. We're not really close to each other's families, but since we're shipping all our stuff, we need somewhere to stay. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA For wanting my wife to spend time with my family.
