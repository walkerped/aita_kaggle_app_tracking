0,1dl6mjt,AITA for doing school work on my dad‘s computer even though he said I could?,"I (m18) am a trans man who got my name changed through the colleges I’m in which I wasn’t allowed to do when I was in high school. For college I can just basically submit an application without having to get anything legally changed and that be OK. I have a laptop that I normally use for my schoolwork but it’s really old and stopped working about two months ago.. now that my college classes are started up for the summer courses I needed some thing pretty quick, so my father let me his laptop that he us now that my college classes are started up for the summer courses. I needed some thing pretty quick, so my father let me use his personal laptop, and he just kept the one that he used for work. 

I am about a month into my course so far and there was a couple assignments. I need to submit using Word which automatically puts my name that I have through the college in the file. I didn’t think anything of it and I could take it out because the assignment said specifically to keep it in. Abt a week ago, my dad needed his laptop back to get some photos off of it or something like that. When he was looking through the files, he found my assignments and he freaked out. he said I wasn’t allowed to do that on his computer and that I should be lucky that I’m allowed to use it in the first place and not disrespect him like that. I explained to him very calmly that he did not have a choice and that’s what the assignment asked for, and if I put my dead name on it, the professor would not know who it belonged to. he got mad and his urging me to change it back in the school, but I told him there was no point because by the full semester I would have it changed legally.

Gave the laptop back a couple days later when he was done with his photos and I kept doing my work like normal, but he still mad at me because I changed it in the system before I changed it legally.

I know I could have a very narrowminded view on this because I’m the one going through it but it’s not like I just came out a month ago. I came out almost a decade ago at this point and he knew about my name change at least eight years ago. He always refused to call me yet and still even now and after I would get it changed legally he said he would only use my initials , or some sort of nickname or something like that. Basically against it, and every single corner and every single aspect. I’m really grateful he let me use his laptop, but I don’t know where the point is where I should stop standing up for myself and being grateful that he let me use it or what to do. Now that I’m an adult and standing up for myself more because I can do more legally especially. I just don’t know where to draw that line because I am grateful but I can’t keep giving up who I am just for my father, especially because I would see that more than he ever would.

2,1dkscoa,AITA buying my step-daughter a used bridesmaid dress?,"I’m getting married in December of this year. I am bringing 2 daughters into this marriage. They’re 8 & 12. My fiance has a daughter from a previous marriage as well, Kiki (15). All 3 girls are in my wedding party, with Kiki as a bridesmaid. I’m letting all of my bridal party pick out their dresses, with the condition they’re all the same color and within a certain budget. I’m also paying for all of them. Kiki sent me a link to the dress she liked and I thought it was pretty. I planned on ordering it once I had the other members of the wedding party sending me what they wanted.

I was scrolling on Facebook one night and one of the buy/sell groups I’m apart of showed the dress that Kiki sent me. It was only used once in a wedding and is in perfect condition. You can’t even tell it was worn before. It also so happened to be in her size. So, I figured it’d be cheaper to buy this as it’s a dress she’ll likely also wear once and never again. The dress new online is $200. The person was selling it for $50 and just wanted it gone. I’ve seen the dress in person. No stains, no smells. Truly a steal. So, I bought it. 

When I told Kiki, she got mad and said she was the only one not getting a brand new dress. I pointed out I’m still getting her new shoes, accessories (again all of her choice), have alternations done to the dress as needed, she’ll have her hair and makeup done with us. If I found any other member of the bridal party’s dress in a similar condition and cheaper price in a Facebook group or a thrift store, I’d buy it. As it is, I’m spending about a grand on dresses for the 5 members of my bridal party. If I can save a little money, I will.

Kiki wants me to buy her the brand new dress. I spoke with my fiance and he agrees with me. We told Kiki if she wants the dress brand new, she can pay the difference. She’s still upset with us. Other members of my husband’s family feels I’m being a cheap ass and should just buy the dress new. AITA?

She picked up her underwear, but left a bunch of blood on the rug that was underneath. I immediately asked her to clean it completely, and she said that she would later. This made me really upset, because I think it's disgusting to just leave period blood on the carpet, and she was leaving for her dad's house in a few hours, so she didn't have much time. 30 minutes passed and she didn't clean it up, and I got really mad at her. I talked to my mom, but it seemed like she didn't care when she got it done, as long as she did. This made me even more mad tbh, bc atm I bathroom was pretty much out of order cus I wasn't using that shit. I kept bugging her abt it for an hour and even brought her hydrogen peroxide to clean it up. She didn't do it.
Her dad ended up coming to pick her up, and that shit was still there. I got so furious and went off on her about how disgusting she is, and how disrespectful she is being to my space. She called me sexist, and said I don't understand because I don't have a period. I get that having a period is hard, but cleaning up afterwards and being responsible about it seems like something she should have learned by 18 years old.

Two of her kids are the same age as mine (9 and 6) and we often have playdates. One day she invited my kids to a local indoor amusement park while I had to work. My kids were excited to go so we set the play date up. She informed me that it’d be 20 dollars for both kids to go to this park. I gave her 50 dollars in cash so it would cover admission plus arcade games or souvenirs my kids may want to get. I offered to pay for gas, but she politely declined. 

The day of this event, I get a text from Emma saying the kids spent more than the fifty bucks, and asked me for an additional 30 for reimbursement. I sent it to her without hesitation. Stuff is expensive. I get it. 
A couple hours later, she informed me they were headed back (it was about a half hour drive away), and she asks me for ANOTHER 20 dollars to cover the costs for McDonald’s. I thought it was weird, but again I sent it.

6,1dkre5e,AITA for refusing to raise my brothers child for him?,"I need to provide a little context: 

I was adopted by the people I consider my real parents when I was 7. My biological father is my adopted mother’s brother, and she adopted my sister and me from him because he’s a nut job. We were all raised with the knowledge that we were adopted. If i’m being honest, the notion of adoption isn’t really a thing in my culture as biological parenthood is very important. Families will just take in a child from an incompetent relative and raise them alongside their own children, but the child is always aware of who their biological parents are. The biological parents are usually involved as well but aren’t the child’s primary guardians and the child usually goes back to their biological parents once they’re more stable.

My younger brother (17M) is a little shit and he got his ex girlfriend pregnant. Furthermore, he cheated on her and she wants nothing to do with him. She figured out she was pregnant too late to get an abortion in our state and her parents won’t let her travel to get one. She wants nothing to do with my brother and our family and I can’t blame the poor girl.

Initially, my mother was going to take the baby and raise it, but obviously, considering how things are done in my culture, my mother was expecting my brothers ex to be involved. Even when my mother promised that she’d let her sign over parental responsibility and move on, she just didn’t seem genuine about it. 

The ex girlfriend decided to just speak to an adoption agency and adopt the baby out externally which upset my mom as you probably guessed why: blood is very important to her. 

My husband and I have been struggling to conceive so I offered to take the baby. But I explained that I would only do it if it was a real adoption, not like how my culture does it where I’d just be raising the baby for my brother. I made it clear that the baby wasn’t a toy to be passed around and that I wouldn’t be giving the child back when my brother finally gets his crap together in 15 years. My brothers ex was happy with this arrangement and we’ve been in the process of getting paperwork started.

Everyone in the family is pissed. They think I’m being unnecessary difficult by going against our cultural conventions just because i’m infertile and want a baby. My mother thinks that I’m being selfish because I was basically raised in the way I’m refusing to raise this child in and i’m being hypocritical. She thinks I should raise the kid with the knowledge of who their real parents are (which is something i’d share with them anyway when the time is right) and give my brother an opportunity to learn to be a father.

I don’t think i’m the AH but given the cultural perspective and the nature of my own upbringing, i’m starting to think i may be being a bit hypocritical.

For one, he is known to be a risk-taker and aggressive on the road as is, and I worry this will translate into him his biking. Some of his friends have bikes and they've taught him how to ride so he's confident this is what he wants. I think that having a motorcycle is already incredibly dangerous as is, and overall isn't worth the risk of getting hurt. You have no protection if you're in an accident, and I know several people who received life-altering injuries on a bike. 

As well, if he sells his car he becomes dependent on borrowing either his parents' cars or having me drive him anywhere we go and I think this will be generally inconvenient. 

So far, I have been very unsupportive of his decision, and he thinks that I'm an AH for not being there for him. I told him I don't want to have to constantly worry about his well-being - which I inevitably will if he does this.

So, a little bit of explanation before I get into it, so I met friend A about three years ago, who introduced me to group A, everyone in group A knows everyone through friend A, so he’s like the glue that holds it all together. It’s the same situation with friend b and group b, but recently I introduced group an and b together, and merged it into quite a big group of friends.

Now that’s been said, I can get into the mess that caused this, so I was out drinking with group a and friend A did a drunk toast thing, and said something along the lines of “here’s to my closest friend, my brother” and then said my name, which I was touched with the sentiment, but one of his other friends, who he has known for close to two decades, stormed off, friend A followed him outside, and they were out there arguing for like, 20 minutes, after a while, I followed them out, because I knew I was involved in whatever was going on. I didn’t want to butt my way in, so I just said “hey bro, I’m sorry if I’ve caused you any offence” and then left it at that. It seemed to get resolved shortly after I got back to our table, because they followed me back shortly after. 

Everything seemed ok until at the end of the night, me and the guy who got pissed before had fell behind the rest of the group as we were walking home, and he said to me that I was a manipulative snake because over the time he hadn’t been around, I’ve somehow became friend A closest friend, and said that I spout so much shit about loyalty to win people over.

I wasn’t trying to get into an argument with a close friend of my best friend, so I said that I’m sorry he felt that way, and didn’t mention it to my friends. I personally saw it as him being self conscious, until I heard that he had talked to a couple guys from group B and they thought the exact same way about me and friend B.

So now I feel odd, because I didn’t think I was really in the wrong at first, but quite a few people have agreed with him, friend a and b both have my back, but idk, i wouldn’t say I’m manipulative, I’m just endearing to those I care about, I make sure they can talk to me, I make sure they know they have my trust and loyalty etc, but it’s being spun like this is a bad thing.

9,1dkquil,AITA My sunglasses got scratched,"Some context here.. I got two new pairs of Oakleys a few weeks ago(there was a sale LOL). This was my first time wearing one of the pairs, on the ten minute drive over to my friends house. I went into his apartment to greet him and ended up leaving them there, in mint condition. The sun was setting and we were heading downtown to a festival, I forgot them. 



Once I got home later that night, he texted me I forgot them and we agreed I'd get them ASAP. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I wasn't able to pick them up for over a week. When I finally get them back today, the lenses were super cloudy like they had been worn in the pool and my buddy mentioned he wore them a couple times. I'm thinking no big deal, I would want to wear them too. I noticed a small scratch on them immediately but didn't want an in-person confrontation. So waited until leaving to thoroughly clean/examine the sunglasses.



We were set to split some expenses on an upcoming concert. I texted him about the glasses and asked if he would offer any sort of compensation, and suggested perhaps anything towards the concert expenses. He said he thinks I am trying to scam him.. For some background on this friendship, I have known this person for a of couple years. We met at first in a professional capacity and became friends. Have gone on multiple road trips, we hang out frequently, go to concerts, etc and I helped him land the six figure job he has right now. 



I told him I'm not asking him for new glasses or new lenses, just asking would he offer anything for compensation? He won't take ownership or offer any apology. And he is mad at me saying I am trying to scam him. New lenses will cost me $80-100. I realize I left my sunglasses over at his apartment and see that if I had just remembered them, none of this would have happened.

Before we leave, I have 30 days off of work, and my wife is also not working. We both want to spend time with our families before we leave. At first, she brought up how she would stay with her family for the whole 30 days, and I would stay with my family for the whole 30 days. But I was hesitant about this because we just got married and this is also considered my vacation time and I want to spend that time with my wife and both of our families equally.

At first, she was completely against this and said it was because she won't see her family in 4 years and wanted to spend as much time as possible with them. At first I understood this and It sort of made sense, but after awhile I thought that 30 days was a long time for both of us to not be working and to not vist both families with equal amount of time. So I brought up a compromise that we spend an equal amount of time with both families. At first, she was also against this idea but eventually agreed to do it.

Today, she messaged saying she's not going to my house during vacation, and she's just going to stay at home. She said she brought it up to her parents, and they agreed that we should both see our own families and that I'm being too controlling over what she does. This started a huge fight, which is where we're at now, so am I the asshole for trying to split this family time between both families?

This is a throwaway account for anonymous reasons. 

Relationship info: 
I’m 27f. My mother and I have a rocky relationship. She tends to use me as her servant for lack of a better word. She currently is going through a divorce with my step father due to financial control issues. They are both well off. 

Okay now for the story. 
My mother recently drove from California to Michigan to help my cousin move in to her new apartment after my cousin moved from another country to the USA. She drove up with my step dad who flew back after driving up. He’s a pilot. 

She was supposed to drive back to California with him as well. Well now she doesn’t want to drive back because she doesn’t like my step dad anymore and hates being around him. She was going to pay to  have her brother fly out and drive back with her as she doesn’t want to drive back alone. But he can’t due to not being able to get time off work. She now has asked me. She wants to pay to fly me out to Michigan and I drive back 31 hrs with her. I told her I don’t think I can get the time off and I need to save my time off for my upcoming wedding. She told me to put in the request and we will go from there. I also told her I need to get my engagement photos done and she told me to just push that back. I kinda agreed to it out of guilt as she is helping pay for the wedding. 

After talking to my fiancé he said that this request is insane and I shouldn’t feel obligated to do it. I now am thinking of telling her I can’t do it but feel like I’m the asshole. My fiancé also said she drove out there with her husband knowing she had to drive back with him so it’s not fair for her to put the burden on me. (which is still an option as he said he would.

Well this is not something you just ""get over"" so NO!

I am ready to call off my wedding and go elope like I wanted to. We'd be out money but for me it's not worth the fight.

Not the intention of somebody in their mid 20s to move back in with their parents, but I was only working part time then and I was about $2-3 grand in debt from school and bills that had racked up. 
Within the 2 years I have been working nonstop to pay off this debt and get myself back on track in a good financial place. Next step-working on my credit. 
Well a few weeks ago I finally get approved a credit card, as long as I have a deposit to put down-no problem. I save up, pay the money and they said the card will arrive in a few weeks. 
About 3 weeks go by and I haven’t seen anything in the mail, and my parents hadn’t mentioned anything to me either. So casually at dinner I bring up that I have an important piece of mail that I’ve been waiting on and asked my family if they could please keep an eye out. 
My step dad looks me dead in my face and tells that he threw it out. I’m sorry what? What do you mean you threw it out? I instantly get mad and have to ask the question of why are you going through my mail and why are you throwing it out? His only response over and over it “I thought it was junk mail” or “idk maybe I didn’t” 
My mom even stands up for me at this point asking him since when do you throw out other people’s mail? 
I tell him that the piece of mail that he threw out was a credit card that I had put actual money down on and that if he threw away I would be expecting him to pay for it. 
This is where things take a turn, and he laughs in my face and tells me that he “isn’t paying me shit because I’m just a freeloader in his house anyways”
Basically we both end up getting pretty heated and saying some pretty nasty things to each other. But he crossed the line with me when he started talking bad about my own dad-reminding me that he’s an addict that has never done anything for me anyways  and then started talking bad about my mom’s dad who just recently passed away. 
He starts calling me fake saying “I’m willing to get in his face over a few hundred dollars and that he sees how much I’m worth” 
But it’s really not even about the money, it’s the fact I have been working hard for this. 
He even started saying that he doesn’t care for me or my siblings because we’re not his kids anyways-meanwhile this man has been in my life since I was 10 years old. 
After all the hurtful stuff that was said to me, I do not feel comfortable staying with my parents anymore. 
My mom says that it’s not a big deal, and that it’s a card and can be replaced and that I should apologize. But I don’t think she understands why I am so upset in the first place. And I also don’t think I can forgive someone that said some pretty hurtful things.
AITA? Should I apologize and let it go?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for blowing up on my Step-Dad for throwing away my Credit Card? I (25f) have been living with my parents for almost 2 years now after a long term relationship (9 years) didn’t work out. Not the intention of somebody in their mid 20s to move back in with their parents, but I was only working part time then and I was about $2-3 grand in debt from school and bills that had racked up. 
Within the 2 years I have been working nonstop to pay off this debt and get myself back on track in a good financial place. Next step-working on my credit. 
Well a few weeks ago I finally get approved a credit card, as long as I have a deposit to put down-no problem. I save up, pay the money and they said the card will arrive in a few weeks.

She wanted to meet us at the restaurant but none of us saw her messages until she told us she was just going to go home. We then called her and told her where we were until our other friend mary(16 F) hung up the phone while we were talking to Norah. We all started to yell at Mary and called Norah back. Norah was very angry and confused on why she got hung up on so I called her back. Norah started blaming me and started to get mad at me and I began to cry. Norah hung up on me and I got very upset because she wasn’t believing me that it wasn’t my fault. As me and my three other friends began to walk away from the group we saw Norah and her mother Caroline(45 F). Caroline immediately pulled over the car and started to yell at me for ignoring her daughter. She was yelling and wouldn’t give me a chance to speak. I tried to fight back until she called my mom and wouldn’t let me speak to her. She told my mom that I was being overdramatic and that I was being rude to her daughter.

19,1dlhha2,AITA - Cat Shenanigans/Dying From Heat Exhaustion,"So, this is a throwaway. I’m a teenager, old enough to drive, and I have two cats.
Today, one of said cats could not be found; which was worrying because today hit like 90 degrees Fahrenheit and I hadn’t seen her all night. I live in a medium sized neighborhood with small yards, so all of the houses are pretty close together. I drive to the street behind my house, using an AirTag to track her to a house. 
My cat was on the roof of this house, meowing and panting. Like this girl was on her last legs. So I call my parents, they come with a ladder. We back my dad’s jeep up to the house and use a ladder on three tailgate, and grab the car after maybe 10 minutes of trying.
The owner wasn’t home, but there was a ring camera. She began talking to us halfway through our attempts, asking us what we were doing, obviously concerned. We apologize and say we’re getting our cat down and I think she said it was fine. Didn’t think it was a big deal, we didn’t hurt her roof or gutters. Just got our cat. 
So, apparently she messaged us the 7 hours ago — this happened today— asking if it was our cat on Facebook. Didn’t see the post, didn’t know who she was. She proceeds to post a rant on the neighborhood Facebook complaining about what we did, saying we climbed on her roof while she wasn’t home. 
This isn’t true? Ish. We climbed to the edge of her roof. Where we grabbed our cat. Which is what we told her we were doing through the ring camera.
She also complained that we needed to ‘take better care of our pets’ and that we needed to ‘get permission to enter a person’s property before entering’.

26,1dlg0cw,AITA for threatening to take back the car I bought my mom?,"Long story short, for a long time I was making a pretty nice salary and my mom wasn’t. My mom is used to having nice things and I could tell she was a bit down in general for a while as she wasn’t making much of a salary and didn’t like many aspects of her life, including the old car she was driving. She kept talking about wanting to buy a nice car since we relocated, and I wasn’t comfortable with it for a while until I decided I wanted to just do something to make her happy.

It wasn’t a smart financial decision I know, but I’m kind of used to just doing everything that she asks also. I ended up spending basically everything I had left in my savings (60k or so) on this car. I’m in my mid twenties btw.

This was about a year ago. 8 months ago, some very intense circumstances arose that led to her moving away back to where we were originally living (different country). She got a great job finally, and I learned that she bought another nice car. 

I initially said the car was a gift, but she several times said she’d pay me when she has the money (I think this came less from a nice place and more from a place of possessiveness and not wanting me to feel like I have any right to the car). She also kept encouraging me to buy it, making it feel like it was a “we” thing and this would be a nice purchase for “us”. Regardless, she said she’d pay me when she can, and for this reason views the car as entirely hers (and as if I loaned her the money), but she hasn’t paid me. I’ve also paid to renew the car insurance just now along with some other minor maintenance.

So here’s the thing:
She’s moved countries, and has just left the car here. I’ve asked her multiple times what she wants to do with it, as it pains me to just see it abandoned and neglected in the parking lot when I spent so much of my money on it. Her response is that she “likes it and wants it” even though she’s not coming back/doesn’t know if and when she’s coming back. She doesn’t want to sell it either, and the thing that has really been getting to me is that she said she “forbids me to touch it”. 

I’m at the point where I want to drive the car (as my primary car), seeing as it’s just sitting there unused. I love cars, have a much much shittier car than the one I bought her, and consequently have no money to afford buying myself something nice at this point. I’ve asked her about it and she said she doesn’t want me using it and especially not if I have another car already (I don’t see why this is relevant to her, but she’s making it sound like I should sell my own car if I want to use hers). I feel like she’s being extremely selfish in how possessive and unwilling she is to share, considering she hasn’t paid a dime for it, and I’m on the verge of telling her I’m taking it back and that it’s mine since me asking to simply use it resulted in such backlash. She’s literally making payments on a new car and not paying me for this one. I feel really taken for granted and taken advantage of. When I brought this up to her after she forbade me from touching it, she said she’d start paying me monthly or that I can take the car but I’d lose her forever”. Even if she were to pay me monthly, this whole ordeal has really messed with my financial stability and she knows that. AITA for telling her I want to use it/ wanting to take it back entirely? 

More context: I’ve also paid off her mortgage almost 100k, and have paid for sooooo many things for her since I started working. I’d have a house of my own now if not for supporting her, but have not even a half year’s salary left from over 4 years of work. She claims I’ve never done anything for her, or that whatever I have done, she’s done much more for me over the course of my life. Maybe this can shed some more light on why I feel so tired of this already. Feels thankless. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for threatening to take back the car I bought my mom? Long story short, for a long time I was making a pretty nice salary and my mom wasn’t. My mom is used to having nice things and I could tell she was a bit down in general for a while as she wasn’t making much of a salary and didn’t like many aspects of her life, including the old car she was driving. She kept talking about wanting to buy a nice car since we relocated, and I wasn’t comfortable with it for a while until I decided I wanted to just do something to make her happy.

It wasn’t a smart financial decision I know, but I’m kind of used to just doing everything that she asks also. I ended up spending basically everything I had left in my savings (60k or so) on this car. I’m in my mid twenties btw.

This was about a year ago. 8 months ago, some very intense circumstances arose that led to her moving away back to where we were originally living (different country). She got a great job finally, and I learned that she bought another nice car. 

I initially said the car was a gift, but she several times said she’d pay me when she has the money (I think this came less from a nice place and more from a place of possessiveness and not wanting me to feel like I have any right to the car). She also kept encouraging me to buy it, making it feel like it was a “we” thing and this would be a nice purchase for “us”. Regardless, she said she’d pay me when she can, and for this reason views the car as entirely hers (and as if I loaned her the money), but she hasn’t paid me. I’ve also paid to renew the car insurance just now along with some other minor maintenance.

So here’s the thing:
She’s moved countries, and has just left the car here. I’ve asked her multiple times what she wants to do with it, as it pains me to just see it abandoned and neglected in the parking lot when I spent so much of my money on it. Her response is that she “likes it and wants it” even though she’s not coming back/doesn’t know if and when she’s coming back. She doesn’t want to sell it either, and the thing that has really been getting to me is that she said she “forbids me to touch it”. 

I’m at the point where I want to drive the car (as my primary car), seeing as it’s just sitting there unused. I love cars, have a much much shittier car than the one I bought her, and consequently have no money to afford buying myself something nice at this point. I’ve asked her about it and she said she doesn’t want me using it and especially not if I have another car already (I don’t see why this is relevant to her, but she’s making it sound like I should sell my own car if I want to use hers). I feel like she’s being extremely selfish in how possessive and unwilling she is to share, considering she hasn’t paid a dime for it, and I’m on the verge of telling her I’m taking it back and that it’s mine since me asking to simply use it resulted in such backlash. She’s literally making payments on a new car and not paying me for this one. I feel really taken for granted and taken advantage of. When I brought this up to her after she forbade me from touching it, she said she’d start paying me monthly or that I can take the car but I’d lose her forever”. Even if she were to pay me monthly, this whole ordeal has really messed with my financial stability and she knows that. AITA for telling her I want to use it/ wanting to take it back entirely? 

More context: I’ve also paid off her mortgage almost 100k, and have paid for sooooo many things for her since I started working. I’d have a house of my own now if not for supporting her, but have not even a half year’s salary left from over 4 years of work. She claims I’ve never done anything for her, or that whatever I have done, she’s done much more for me over the course of my life. Maybe this can shed some more light on why I feel so tired of this already. Feels thankless. ",0.0,0.040690716356039,0,1

Although A has many good qualities, his bad side is that he has no understanding for other people's problems and needs, he is decent but that doesn't mean he will help or support everyone. A has 10 very good friends and wife with whom he is constantly in fun activities that I cannot attend for various reasons(we live far from each other, I don't drive a car and I don't even have money for the bus).From the 8 months of our friendship, I often tell him about how I have no friends except him and how no one loves me (which is not far from the truth). Our chat today was the final straw. He told me that I was just complaining and not doing anything about making friends, he also said that he is tired of such messages because he is not to blame for my condition and that he is just a man living his life. A is right for this too but i love his motivational messages which are so wonderful and give me strength even to move a mountain

I know it's rude that I talk too much about the past and that I'm jealous of him, but he's my only friend, after all, I'm not jealous of him, but of my situation, I'm just ""projecting"" it onto a certain person.

My oldest brother ‘Daniel’ (29M) is on the spectrum. My mom often asks for help to take care of him. The only problem is Daniel is very high functioning. He has a license and a car, and he has the mental capacity to live on his own. My parents just coddle him, and treat him like a child. He lives in the house, and he doesn’t help with the chores whatsoever. He will eat up all the food in the house, and then ask us to buy him food at his old age, and he won’t replace the groceries, so I will use my money that I need for the car note and bills to help around the house. He doesn’t have a job either, so he stays at home doing this all day.

Me and our youngest brother ‘Chris’ (17M) do the blunt of the dirty work. Our mother will go ask us to buy Daniel food despite him having a car. Well one day, our mother asked us to buy Daniel food while me and Chris were both at work. We both work at restaurants, so she thinks we can just walk out with food, but we have to pay for it. I asked her why Daniel couldn’t get his own food, and she said that he didn’t have any money. I told her she should send him some money, or I’ll do it, but she says to do as she asks. I told her I make no promises. 

I get off at 10:25pm, and Chris texts me that he’s off too, and he’s ready to be picked up. I drive over to his job, and get out the car to find out that Daniel and Chris have been going back and forth through the phone for 7 minutes, over Chris telling Daniel to send him money, because he can’t afford to buy Daniel food. Daniel personally went to Chris to ask for this since he’s young. I immediately called Daniel to tell him that Chris is only 17, and he’s not entitled to buy a grown man food. Daniel says that we’re both disrespectful and he’s going to tell mom on us (mind you he’s almost 30 snitching to his mother). I told Daniel to get a job, move out the house, and stop blaming his condition on everything. Daniel was fuming and then I told Daniel if he’s going to act like that, then he can get his own food. I told my mother that we aren’t buying a 29 year old man food, because he’s too lazy to get it himself.

She sent Daniel some money, and then called me on the phone crying saying we were making her life harder, and we’re both being TAs. Chris is a 17 year old boy and I work 50 hours a week at 21. We shouldn’t be entitled to buy him food when he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself. It’s even worse that he’s expecting it from us now.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for making my brother buy his own food? I (21M) still live with my parents and some of my siblings. 

My oldest brother ‘Daniel’ (29M) is on the spectrum. My mom often asks for help to take care of him. The only problem is Daniel is very high functioning. He has a license and a car, and he has the mental capacity to live on his own. My parents just coddle him, and treat him like a child. He lives in the house, and he doesn’t help with the chores whatsoever. He will eat up all the food in the house, and then ask us to buy him food at his old age, and he won’t replace the groceries, so I will use my money that I need for the car note and bills to help around the house. He doesn’t have a job either, so he stays at home doing this all day.

Me and our youngest brother ‘Chris’ (17M) do the blunt of the dirty work. Our mother will go ask us to buy Daniel food despite him having a car. Well one day, our mother asked us to buy Daniel food while me and Chris were both at work. We both work at restaurants, so she thinks we can just walk out with food, but we have to pay for it. I asked her why Daniel couldn’t get his own food, and she said that he didn’t have any money. I told her she should send him some money, or I’ll do it, but she says to do as she asks.

My (27F) brother(30M, B) immediately started dating this girl (Em) after dating his ex (M) 10 years ago. I really liked M and thought they had a life together, and was so mad at him for chasing after some other girl instead of staying with M who was better for him.

Em and B have been together 10 years but Em and I have never gotten along. I told her when I met her that I had wanted redheaded nieces and nephews (M was a red head and she is not). She doesn’t really know B. They’ll come back from trips/concerts and say they had fun. I know he’s lying. He never liked Taylor Swift before her. He’s faking it for her, but when I remind her HE doesn’t like TS, they both get quiet.

I stayed close with M and we thought they’d break up. I’ve fine w/ Em but she has gotten mad at me, but it’s always over the small things.

B graduated residency and is starting his own fam med. I am an NP who has not been able to find a job, and they are hiring for an NP and I thought it would be the perfect fit! I reached out to B and told him I’d absolutely take the job and didn’t get a response until he called me.

I guess Em has quit her job to manage the practice, and because of the tension over the years, he doesn’t think it’s a good fit for Em and I to work together. I was dumb-founded. I asked if Em made this decision and he said he hadn’t asked her. But I know this is her.

I sent her a text telling her I thought it was unfair of her to ruin my career. Em could get a job anywhere, but I can’t. Idk why he’s ok to work with his wife and not me when we used to be so closer. It would make more sense for me to work there because I have a med background and she doesn’t.  Idk why she has been against me from the time they got together, but it’s hurting my feelings and I can’t stay quiet on it now that it’s impacting me professionally.

Em responded cordially like she always does, but she uses calmness and fake kindness to manipulate people. She said she was sorry to hear this, but she really isn’t sure what happened. She said she’ll talk to B to get caught up to speed, but it sounds like he has made his decision. I wasn’t the kindest back to that because I know it’s not true.

B called and yelled at me. He was so harsh I immediately started sobbing but he wouldn’t back down. I hung up and texted him I was crying so hard I threw up but he never responded.

Our family has always stayed out of it when they’re mad at me. My mom said it was ok to ask, but I needed to take the answer.

38,1dlevzp,AITA for not answering my friends calls or texts when she needs me?,"
My friend (Mauve) and I started our friendship at one of our previous workplaces. She is small in stature and was treated like she was incapable because of it. Management kept giving her easier jobs when the rest of the crew was struggling to keep up, which created a resentment for her. My best friend (Donny) and I decided to take her under our wing and with our help and actual training, she thrived and started getting treated better. We all eventually ended up leaving that job, but some of our friendships remained.

My first red flag should've been that Mauve started to bad mouth Donny to me, saying having a guy best friend was weird and that she didn't feel like he was a very good friend to me. Donny and I were close because of a prior toxic friendship that we helped each other out of, so Mauve wasn't going to change my mind about him.

Now the second red flag: I am married, I have been with my husband for 13 years, far longer than I've known Mauve. We would go out and she would talk about herself and her problems the entire time. The few times I got to talk, she would make my issues seem small compared to hers, except with my husband. She would immediately tell me to leave him. I may complain about him but that man is my world and I would never abandon him the way she was telling me to. In my opinion, these were little things that I would vent to her about, then I'd go home and talk it out with my husband and when I'd tell her that we reached a resolution, she wouldn't seem happy. She would seem happiest when my life was falling apart, so I stopped talking to her.

During those 4 years apart, I had taken time to seek help. I had a lot of personal life issues that deteriorated me and, with hard work and effort, I came out of it better than I started and because of all this change I was happier, less self critical but lonely. I still love my best friend Donny, he's still in my life and he's wonderful but he's not a girl and there are somethings you can only talk to with women. I thought long and hard about the good and bad times with Mauve. I had hoped she had done the same.

I was wrong. She's the same. Mauve knows virtually nothing about me after talking regularly for 6 months. She will spend, and this is no exaggeration, 4 to 6 hours talking about herself and her issues to me once or twice a week. She's going through a divorce and is having a very difficult time with it and struggling with self harm thoughts.

So AITA for not answering her calls and texts whenever she needs a 4+ hour phone call to talk about the same thing she talked about the last 4+ hour phone call??

39,1dlesj3,WIBTA if I completely cut off a coworker who seemingly used me for a ride?,"  At first, said coworker and I were cool. He even asked me to hang out with him outside of work  once so we did. I live literally only six minutes away from him. At one point I cut off contact with him because I felt he was supporting another coworker who was sexually harassing me while I was venting to him, and that's when our relationship changed. He never apologized to me for his behavior, but we did discuss it, so I moved on. I carried on conversing with him, but he began to mask rude remarks as jokes. 

  Recently someone informed me that he was talking to others behind my back saying things like “we don’t talk anymore” I have no idea why he was spreading that around because I had recently offered for him to practice on my car so he can get his license. Later on this same day he asked for a ride home and since I didn't want him to be stranded at night I gave him one even though multiple people told me not to. The next day he came to me apologizing after he found out that I knew he was talking about me behind my back and he AGAIN asked me to hang out with him. He also told me he wasn’t using me, that he likes me, that I’m “so sweet and nice”.

 Following his ""apology,"" which involved him revisiting the past incident and expressing sentiments like he didn't appreciate my previous apology a month back, despite my lack of fault, I discovered from two other individuals that he had been saying even more negative things before this ""apology,"" such as labeling me as a ""last resort"" and expressing  reluctance to ask for a ride due him apparently not wanting to associate with me outside of work and not wanting me to ask to hang out even though HE was the one who asked to hang. If I knew he said THOSE things I definitely would not have given him that ride home. He did pay me for the ride and it was luckily only one time before I found out. 

  After learning this, I sent him a text telling him to never to ask for a ride from me again. Additionally, I confronted him for his dishonesty and how he used me for a ride, I also told him that I had never asked him to spend time with me. The fact that I live just 6 minutes away from his place makes me feel like a asshole, especially since his house come up before mine. No one else is willing to take him, and there are no buses available at night, meaning he will likely have to pay around $30 for a Uber ride everyday unless someone else will take him.

42,1dldu2r,AITA for not communicating well after being stalked?,"I met this one dude we'll call Frank for privacy reasons a few months ago at a DnD club. He was always very interested in me especially after finding out that I am a trans man. We became friends as we also had some classes together. I could tell he liked me because he would always make suggestive comments towards me that I would just brush off and would remind him I was actively talking with someone else romantically but he would keep saying those things. 

A few months of this pass and my little talking phase with the other person ended in me being friendzoned and I did tell Frank this as we were pretty good friends at that point. A bit later I went over to his place to hang out and play some games and he ended up confessing to me officially. I friendzoned him as I wasn't interested and had a lot on my plate at the time. One of those things was tech week for a show I was acting in and I had to be completely dialed in for that. 

The very next day Frank created a Twitter account and followed only me and would spam like any of my more freaky posts or any posts mentioning my transition. I even tested it by purposely posting tame posts alongside trans posts and every time he would only ever like the trans one. Between that and all the comments he's made in the past he was giving of major chaser vibes and I'm not comfortable with a cis person interacting with/viewing me in such a way.

A few days later after one of the classes me and Frank were in ended I headed straight over to the blackbox where the play I was in was held. Since it was the same day as DnD club I assumed Frank would just go there, I even took a completely different route than he would have to take. As soon as I got to the stage (about a 5-6 minute walk) I set my bag down and started talking to some of my friends and I noticed Frank had followed me all the way and said nothing. He was just pacing around in a dark corner of the room and I was freaking out.

I never responded and just went on with my life.

Cut to now a few weeks later and Frank sent me another message through Discord asking me how I was. I think its reasonable to say I'm still upset and creeped out so I just ended up blocking him.

I met this one dude we'll call Frank for privacy reasons a few months ago at a DnD club. He was always very interested in me especially after finding out that I am a trans man. We became friends as we also had some classes together. I could tell he liked me because he would always make suggestive comments towards me that I would just brush off and would remind him I was actively talking with someone else romantically but he would keep saying those things. 

A few months of this pass and my little talking phase with the other person ended in me being friendzoned and I did tell Frank this as we were pretty good friends at that point. A bit later I went over to his place to hang out and play some games and he ended up confessing to me officially. I friendzoned him as I wasn't interested and had a lot on my plate at the time. One of those things was tech week for a show I was acting in and I had to be completely dialed in for that. 

The very next day Frank created a Twitter account and followed only me and would spam like any of my more freaky posts or any posts mentioning my transition. I even tested it by purposely posting tame posts alongside trans posts and every time he would only ever like the trans one. Between that and all the comments he's made in the past he was giving of major chaser vibes and I'm not comfortable with a cis person interacting with/viewing me in such a way.

A few days later after one of the classes me and Frank were in ended I headed straight over to the blackbox where the play I was in was held. Since it was the same day as DnD club I assumed Frank would just go there, I even took a completely different route than he would have to take. As soon as I got to the stage (about a 5-6 minute walk) I set my bag down and started talking to some of my friends and I noticed Frank had followed me all the way and said nothing.

the money was already spent and i’ve always been the youngest in the office so i felt like i had to go. i do some of the bookkeeping so i know that the couple hundred he spent was money we needed lol. for some background: i had to pay to join the association so the registration could be switched to my name and we were short staffed all week so i’ve been working through lunches and late almost everyday this week (also had family in town). i left work thursday to head to the city and an accident made my drive closer to three hours so i got in much later than expected.

They havent hungout in a really long time (we've been dating for 2yrs and they've never gotten together once over that span of time). They only catch up if they run into eachother out and about, theyre not close. My bf has tried to hangout with her over the years but shes been too busy with her girlfriend, his words not mine. 

Mary works as a server at oliver garden and i go there every once and a while with friends and ill see her but she never acknowledges me- which is fine since we dont really know eachother. 

Mary and my bfs mom and his sister(12f) happened to run into eachother at an icecream place and mary told my bfs mom that shes seen me going out to olive garden with men and getting real friendly with them. Implying that ive been cheating. For context my best friend is a gay man and my other close friend is a straight man. My bf has met them multiple times and has hungout with all of us collectively. 

My bfs mom is one of those ""boy moms"" that are constantly worried about their son and hasnt liked me from the beginning, but this sent her over the edge. I feel like i can never visit his family with him again because of this. His sister heard it as well and i feel so ashamed for something i didnt do. His sister is like a little sister to me and losing her respect hurts. 
I feel like i can never faced them again because no matter what they wont believe me. And i dont understand why mary couldnt have called me bf and told him directly, why did she have to tell him mom and ruin any chances i had to be civil with her. And why did mary have to say it infront of his little sister?? 

I honestly hate mary for this. If she thought she was protecting her friend she should have told HIM. Now that the damage is done i told my bf i cant stay with him if he continues to be ""friends"" (quotations because they dont talk or hangout ever) with her after what shes done. He thinks this is too big of an ask and he has to think about it.

 I hate even making it an ultimatum, i feel like its toxic but i just cant stand her getting away with it. How does she get to do that and not have consequences??

My bfs mom wants him to break up with me and move out of our home for this and he might be considering it after my ultimatum.

46,1dld9gd,AITA for not being able to afford a boat?,"Bit of background: I (28F), Mari (26F), & Zack (29M) have been really good best friends for the last few years.

Mari about 2 months ago messaged out group chat saying they wanted to celebrate their bday at Lake Havasu. Right front the getgo, I mentioned to her that I wasn't sure if I could make it since I have two trips before and after that weekend, which would've been too much financially. Knowing this, she said it was going to be a chill weekend and we'd mainly be by the lake so I said yes. Zack also mentioned he'd be tight on money since he was going to visit family out of state. With all that said, she continued with the bday festivities.

Mari got an airbnb that would've cost $100-$120 for the whole weekend (pretty good deal) but then they mentioned all the extra things they wanted to get like a cabana and a pontoon, which would've added at least $350 PER PERSON. Our group dwindled down to 6 of us so that also made prices go up for each of us. The majority of us began expressing concerns that this was out of budget and that we could sacrifices all the frills and still have a good time. The cost didn't include how much we'd spend on gas, food, and alcohol so all of us knew this would've easily moved to the $600-700 range. Both Zack and I didn't want to ruin the plans so we kept reassuring Mari that we'd still have a great time and make the most out of it to which she ghosted us. She then decided to cancel it because she saw it as a mini ""vacation"" and if she knew we couldn't do the boat and everything else, she would've planned a trip elsewhere. The trip was cancelled a week before it happened.

Moving to now, Mari's birthday was a few days ago (and before the planned trip) and some of us (who were on the trip) messaged and sent our bday wishes to her. Turns out that she's being petty and hasn't responded to any of us. At first we thought the day of that she was busy, etc. until I found out my younger sister (who was also going on the trip) got a ""thank u"" response from her the same day whereas we, her main BFF's, didn't.

We're all annoyed at the matter since Mari is trying to blame us. In the past she has broken one of her closest friendships over bday plans.

49,1dlcfak,"AITA for ""breaking up"" my nephew's family by helping him go away to university?","Throwaway, for privacy. My (42M) sister (6yr older) passed away 6 years ago, leaving one son, “Jeff”, (11 at the time) and her husband, “Scott.”  I live in the same city and have always been close with my nephew, as, he, like me, is a precocious mathematician and coder.  

I got along fine with Scott, though he always struck me as a bit of a weak personality and not an intellectual match for my formidable and successful sister. She wore the pants in that marriage. Since her death, I stepped up my time with Jeff and continued to help him pursue enrichment in math/CS. 3yrs ago, Scott married “Jane”, who brought with her 2 daughters (now 9 and 11). Later, they had a son together (now 2).  It has not gone well for Jeff. Jane dominates Scott, and has pushed the “blended family”  hard.  Jeff has little in common with his sisters or Jane. I’d guess he’s got at least 25IQ points on anybody in that house.  Jane has also pushed him to be involved in her church, much to Jeff’s annoyance (my sister was vocally atheist and Jeff is not into religion either). He spends as much time at my house as he can get away with. 

When it was time for Jeff to apply to college, his parents were insisting that he only consider commuting to one of two universities close to home, because, “if you leave, you won’t ever bond with your siblings” and because, “you should help out at home.”  They also objected to the cost, though my sister left a lot of money and a fully paid-off house behind. Much of this has been used to pay for a bigger house to accommodate the new family and for the stepkids’ private schools (lesson:leave your inheritance to a trust for your kids!). Jeff secretly applied to his mother’s alma mater, a top Ivy League school, and got in.  Jane was furious and she and Scott said they wouldn’t pay for him to go.  I happen to be successful, rich, and childless. I told them and Jeff that I would pay (I can afford it easily). His parents flipped out on him and me, and things have been tense for the last few months.  They continue to pressure Jeff not to go away to school, to the point that they ALSO put down a deposit for him at the local university. When it became clear that Jeff was really going, Jane pivoted to complaining that if I am paying for Jeff’s education, I should make the same contribution to her other kids, to which I replied that I am not related to her, her husband or her other kids;  I am related to Jeff, the son of the person whom I was closest to for much of my life. Jeff turns 18 in two weeks and I have offered to let him move in with me for this summer (and future summers, if necessary).  Jane has been berating me for “trying to break up her family” and Scott has been less strident but has asked me to consider Jane’s feelings.  Am I the asshole for interfering in my nephew’s family?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for ""breaking up"" my nephew's family by helping him go away to university?

He spends as much time at my house as he can get away with. 

When it was time for Jeff to apply to college, his parents were insisting that he only consider commuting to one of two universities close to home, because, “if you leave, you won’t ever bond with your siblings” and because, “you should help out at home.”  They also objected to the cost, though my sister left a lot of money and a fully paid-off house behind. Much of this has been used to pay for a bigger house to accommodate the new family and for the stepkids’ private schools (lesson:leave your inheritance to a trust for your kids!). Jeff secretly applied to his mother’s alma mater, a top Ivy League school, and got in.  Jane was furious and she and Scott said they wouldn’t pay for him to go.  I happen to be successful, rich, and childless. I told them and Jeff that I would pay (I can afford it easily). His parents flipped out on him and me, and things have been tense for the last few months.  They continue to pressure Jeff not to go away to school, to the point that they ALSO put down a deposit for him at the local university. When it became clear that Jeff was really going, Jane pivoted to complaining that if I am paying for Jeff’s education, I should make the same contribution to her other kids, to which I replied that I am not related to her, her husband or her other kids;  I am related to Jeff, the son of the person whom I was closest to for much of my life. Jeff turns 18 in two weeks and I have offered to let him move in with me for this summer (and future summers, if necessary).  Jane has been berating me for “trying to break up her family” and Scott has been less strident but has asked me to consider Jane’s feelings.  Am I the asshole for interfering in my nephew’s family?",0.0,0.0711919218301773,0,1
50,1dlccin,AITA for refusing to talk to my divorced mom?,"she got pregnant again after having me and had a girl, two years later she had a boy, I'm not gonna say their real names for private reasons, but let's just call them Eric and Luna.

my dad later told us that we had to move out due to his job place, so we went to south Africa, here's when my mom begin to be worse.

there's alot that happened here but netherless to say, my dad eventually divorced my mom because she kept neglecting us.

moving forward, my dad won the custody and me and my four siblings are currently living with him as he married our current step mom.

whenever we visit mom, she would try to tell us things that aren't true, my younger siblings would believe her since they're just children who aren't even teenagers yet, but I had my suspicious about her words so I didn't pay it much attention, last time we visited her, she kicked me out of the apartment, why? simple, I told her that our visit is over and we need to go back to south Africa, she kicked me out and locked herself and my siblings inside with her, thankfully I had my stuff ready but my suitcase was still inside, so all I had was a phone, my charger, and my shoes on, that's all I had, I called dad and asked him to pick me up.

it's been 15 days and my mom didn't even think about contacting me, but we manged to get two of my sisters back, Jasmine (10F) and Claire (6F), in the car, Jasmine was crying because she was scared of mom, Claire tried to calm her down but ended up crying as well, only leaving my step mom to calm the both of them down, while me and my dad tried reasoning with Luna (13F) and Eric(11M), but they just said that they wanted to live with mom, Eric was not taking shit seriously and I gave up with him.

they ended up coming back, they had learned a tough lesson but at least now they know that living with mom is not good for them in the slightest.

the recent call I got from her was yesterday, she called and I answered ""what"", which she instantly got mad at me and said ""what? what do you mean what? I am your mother, you do not give me that attitude, give me your siblings now, I want to talk with them."" I gave her Luna first, she gave the phone to Eric, then it got passed to Claire after a few minutes, Jasmine never took the phone since she refused to talk to mom after what happened last time we visited, when the phone got passed to me, I asked her what's her problem and she said ""it's non of your business, I do not want to talk to you"" so I replied ""okay, then don't call my fuckingnumber again"" then hang up and blocked her number.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for refusing to talk to my divorced mom? she got pregnant again after having me and had a girl, two years later she had a boy, I'm not gonna say their real names for private reasons, but let's just call them Eric and Luna.

52,1dlbxbb,"WIBTA or am I [29M] making a big deal emotionally that my friend [30F], who lives abroad, has just told me they're going on vacation tomorrow, when they've had it booked for over a week?","I really dont know what people think is the most reasonable feeling or if someone could offer a pespective?

My friend 'L' just told me shes going on holiday for a few days. We were just talking and she told me she's going tomorrow and that she purposefully didn't say anything because she wasn't excited and didnt like when people get excited for her, when she isn't and that its tiring.

  
She's had this booked for about a week and we talk literally everyday, throughout the day, and for hours at a time. About everything from life, to music, to how we are feeling good or bad or work. Just everything. We've been close friends for about 4 years now but do live coutries apart. So its not like i physically wont see her or be with her, cause thats already the case and not an issues. And also where she is going wont change us contacting each other besides that she might be busy vacationing, and thats fine and nothing new too.

I've always had issues expressing my wants and usually when i feel wronged i tend to keep it in cause thats ""less trouble"". So i've been making an effort to just say whats on my mind rather than to keep it inside and my friend has always encouraged me and told me how she feels good i told her about things.

So right now i feel thats pretty shitty that she kept it from me. I wanted her to have told me and that I expected her to know me enough to understand she didnt need that fear of having to force a emotion. That she could have just told me shes not excited yet and doesnt want me to act it for her. Cause i know her enough to know that sometimes you just feel some things and thats ok. So for her to not tell me just makes me feel weird and upset. Like she doesnt trust me.

Now, i havent told her how i felt much, just that its a bit weird but then tried to just move along and now be happy for her. I havent told her im actually upset by this because I know she needs a break, i want her to have fun, i dont want her to go while ive been upset or for her to feel guilty about how i feel. So im basically doing everything that i have tried so hard to change in myself.

I just dont know if im right to be upset or even angry or something that one of my closest friends doesnt trust me to just talk to me and hope i can understand.

Am i overreacting? I guess you could argue that i am NOW not understanding her feeling or fear or anxiety to have hide something from a friend. But i dont know if my feeling upset for how ive been treated is selfish and that i should feel more for her that she felt she had to hide it.

53,1dlbwqu,AITA for warning my sister's boyfriend she wanted our parents to confront him at dinner?,"My(23f) family went out for dinner a few days ago to celebrate my sister(26f) Jenn's birthday. When we got to the restaurant Jenn was already there alone. She said she told her boyfriend Blake the time got pushed back 30 minutes because she needed to talk to us alone. Jenn was mad at Blake for not getting her any birthday gifts and only took her out to dinner to a place they go to often. Our parents understood her being upset and she asked if they would try talking to him because she couldn't get Blake to understand how hurtful that was. I asked her if she had given him her usual 'present' for his birthday or last holiday and Jenn said that wasn't important.

For context, my sister's idea of a gift for her partner is lingerie and sex, and only ever that. I don't know about her past relationships but I do know in the 2 years they've been together, I've heard and seen Blake give her gift ideas for him and he winds up buying them for himself after the fact. He's come to Christmas at our house with gifts for Jenn and Jenn always shows up empty handed for him saying she'd give him his present later.

I told Jenn it sounded like she got as good as she gives whereas our parents said I should be concerned someone would be dismissive and vindictive toward my sister. Our parents said they'd think about talking to him based on his behavior when he arrived. So I text Blake that Jenn was setting him up for a lecture. 

He wound up not showing up. Last night Jenn called me angry. She saw my text to him and realized my text was the reason he canceled and accused me of not having her back and she's told our parents I butt into their relationship but I figure she was trying to get us involved in her relationship anyway. I probably could have just stayed quiet but at the time it didn't sit right with me what she was trying to do. AITA?

Mini Update: Thank you everyone for the responses. I wouldn't say my sister is the golden child since we were treated equally growing up, more that our parents are family first no matter what. This is not the first time shes tried getting others to fight her battles, just the furst time she's done it in public and with our parents. I do not know if our parents know her gift giving but it's pretty easy to figure out based on her comments being the same with every boyfriend she's had since high school. And no, I do not have feelings for Blake, I have a boyfriend of my own I love very much.

They are broken up and as some of you guessed, Jenn is blaming me but honestly I wasn't expecting to come through unscathed after I warned him. I got the news from our mother who called earlier to hark on me not backing my sister up against a man who disregarded her wishes on an important day and bailed. I told mom there are times you absolutely do have family's back but when your daughter only ever forwards nature's gift card to her partners on gift giving occasions knowing they've asked for something else and then involves the entire family for getting her process turned around on her isn't it. Instead of agreeing to a public intervention, she should've told Jenn to leave us out if it and keep it between them. Maybe shut down Jenn's 'all men need is sex to be happy' rhetoric years ago and maybe she'd have a son-in-law by now. So that's all that. Thanks again, I think I'm going to go buy some 'just for the hell of it' gifts for my own boyfriend.

54,1dlbt5t,AITA for avoiding my dad and unintentionally avoiding my sister ,"
My family and I are currently on vacation at the beach, and after the 2nd day here it was like a switch flipped in my dad. He was suddenly in a bad mood, but only towards me. It’s like everything I say he has to comment on or criticize.

 Just a couple days ago in the afternoon my mom and I were eating our lunch (old bay shrimp) at the dining table and my sister made a very dramatic “eww” sound and covered her nose, then turned around and started laughing about it. She doesn’t like shrimp and so we started laughing with her. My dad then added in “That shit stinks”. The mood was lighthearted tho so everything was fine, I then chimed in with “U and (sisters name) can sympathize with each other then”. My sister and mother laughed but then my dad said “ No one asked u to comment” in a harsh tone. And suddenly the mood was ruined for me. 

So after that lunch I kinda just went downstairs and started avoiding him. But my sister has wanted to play with me on multiple occasions since and I’ve said yes as long as we do it somewhere my dad isn’t (there’s 4 floors to the beach house). But she’s refused stating that she wants “to be around daddy” and so we haven’t played. I still go around him when we’re eating or just chilling in communal spaces together. I just don’t want to be alone in a space with him without my mother(who’s been trying to get him to ease up on me). 

So I feel really bad for not hanging out with my sister a lot but I’m just tired of getting yelled at on my vacation.

We are all sharing my bathroom as there is only one other bathroom in my house, and it’s in my parents room. I am generally a neat freak, and like to keep my bathroom spotless. Well, since they have arrived my bathroom has been anything but that. Me and my cousin keep finding poop (and in the bathtub), pubic hairs, and piss all over the floor. Also, I had a very nice toilet seat that my brother bought me (Weird gift but very much appreciated) and they broke it on the second day of being here. My grandparents are notorious for not taking care of the things they own, and even more notorious for not taking care of things that are not theirs.
I know it’s not my cousin, because we have shared bathrooms before and we have never experienced a issue like this. We are both getting really frustrated with the repulsiveness of this situation, and frankly, I’m tired of having to accidentally step in and clean, someone else’s excrements. 

My cousin wants to confront them, but I am generally a bit more hesitant, as they are guests and older (I don’t know if they can control bowel movements as well as younger people?). I really don’t want to embarrass my grandparents, but the situation is so awful that I feel like I should talk to them, WIBTA if I tried to at least have them try to clean up after themselves?

57,1dlbonf,AITA/ For missing Father’s Day due to my great grandmother’s accident? ,"Hi, I’m a (19M) and this is my first Reddit post so bare with me here. Anyways my great grandmother (83F) had a bad fall and was therefore in some bad shape. I love my Great-Grandmother as she has been such a big part of my life. However, the weekend after her fall happened to be Father’s Day and also happened to be the weekend I was free to go see her. My Dad (45M) and I have a strained relationship but I do love him very much. Anyways, I decided I needed to go see my Great-Grandmother and help her around the house. This included buying and putting up her groceries and helping to clean her pool. My Great Grandmother is a sweet woman who I adore and ever since my Great Grandfather died I have been trying to help her every chance I get.

Anyways my great grandmother (83F) had a bad fall and was therefore in some bad shape. I love my Great-Grandmother as she has been such a big part of my life. However, the weekend after her fall happened to be Father’s Day and also happened to be the weekend I was free to go see her. My Dad (45M) and I have a strained relationship but I do love him very much. Anyways, I decided I needed to go see my Great-Grandmother and help her around the house.

58,1dlbnpv,AITA for not helping girl I’ve been exclusively dating for 7 months that I cannot pay her $500 fine for bringing weed through airport.,"So I M22 have been exclusively seeing this women F28 for 7 months now, we spend every weekend together and last month I took her on a trip to Jamaica for her birthday. I paid for everything on the trip and we had a great time. On the way back from the trip she snuck some weed into her suitcase and we just so happened to be randomly searched at the airport in Florida.

We got detained, missed our flights back home and she was told that she had 30 days to pay off a $500 fine before it turned into a $5,000 fine. I told her I would help her with it.

Fast forward ward to the past week, she requested $350 from me to pay for the hotel she bought for us in Florida and $250 for her court fees because she missed court for another case of driving uninsured and she had a bench warrant for her arrest. I send her the money both times, but that was the money I had set aside to help her with her $500 fine. 

She must pay the fine by Sunday and I recently had issues with my car so I had to take it into the shop to get it fixed and I had to pay a lot for it. I need my car for work and gym. I texted her that I can not help her pay for her fine because I had already sent her money that month and I had to get my car fixed and she was very upset with me. She lives with her father so I suggest that she ask for his help to pay the fine. Also, she did not want to see me this weekend because I told her I must go to a podcast I’m on Friday and I would be able to see her Saturday.

We have a very strong bond and are both into fitness and have helped her with bills multiple times in the past before but it just seems like I’m doing too much, especially because she was the one that got herself into that situation with bringing illegal substances (weed)back from Jamaica.

Edit: I live at home with my parents and had no bills because I’m a student and run an online business. She lives at home with her mom and dad but has big car payments and pays rent. Also she is very attracted to me and didn’t ask me for any money until a few months into dating. Sometimes she would often accuse me of talking to other women and feel jealous or insecure about nothing.

Edit 2:
She is coming today to get her AirPods she left at my house. We are going to have a talk about things but it seems likely she is going to choose to be single and not want to see me anymore after I make it clear to her I can’t keep sending her money.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for not helping girl I’ve been exclusively dating for 7 months that I cannot pay her $500 fine for bringing weed through airport.

59,1dlbkky,AITA for dropping my friend?,"Friend who relies on me for favors, rides, etc. I don't mind to an extent. Even borrowed my car for driving test. Thought she's just not independent or doesn't know to pay for services so I let her. 

Let her stay at my place cuz her lease ended. Had a new puppy at the time. Rarely ask for favors but asked her to watch him while I buy a crate. Two min in at target I get a text that she has to meet a friend. Could wait 5 min and I'd be back but insists on leaving that second and left my pup to piss all over the floor. Realized I am being a pushover and quietly cut her off after she found a place.

We reconnected(forgot why I cut her off tbh). She was obsessed with me saying we're the same person and 'look the same'. Talks about being ""independent"" but still inconveniences. Borrowed clothes, I said yes as long as she gives back before a certain day. Agrees on dropping it off, but never does. Two weeks after she borrows I ask again, annoyed she missed the agreed date, told her it's her responsibility to drop off. Gives attitude. ""Did I say I'm not going to give it back?""

Her college grad was on Father's Day. Months before, begged me to come cuz her family can't come from china(they ended up coming). Texts the night before to go to LA at 9:30pm(hour from me)for grad dinner. 8am the next day and a bunch of blood tests/exams so I can't eat for 12 hours, so I tell her idk abt dinner but I'll still go to her grad. She says her grad is close friends and family and gets upset that I can't come to the dinner which is just friends. I tell her I'lltry but can't guarantee.

Day of grad comes and I ask what seats I am. No response. By the time it's 5 I realize she's salty and deliberately ignored. Ditched my dad so I could go to her grad. Did my part in making time for her. Got a message next day saying 'misunderstood' and that she thought I couldn't come to both grad and dinner even though I clarified like five times. Then switches her story saying she 'uninvited me' when she said her grad will only be close friends and family in the vague text she sent the night before.

Furious cuz I could've spent that time with family. Explained how her actions were disrespectful, and replies saying ""How did I waste your precious time"" and ""Well my bad lmao"". I am fuming. I tell her ""you are not going to fucking say 'my bad'"" and to ""KNOW WHEN TO BE FUCKING MAD"". Made time for her and she's mad I didn't make even more. Told her it's her place to apologize. She says ""you don't deserve apology because I 'cursed her out'"". Pulls the classic ""this is why no one stays in your life"". I keep my circle small to stay private. Something she asks for advice because she has friends who ""can't meet her needs"" and wants smaller circle like me. Way to project insecurities about having no real friends.

61,1dlbj12,AITA for telling my wife that it's time to put her grandmother in a nursing home?,"
My (39F) wife (38F) grandmother (84F) has been living with us for the past year after her husband and  caregiver passed away from a broken hip. 

 (Her grandfather never really made any arrangements for what would happen to his wife should he die before her)

My wife is very close with her grandparents and immediately following her grandfather's death, she offered to take care or her grandmother in our home so she wouldn't have to be put in a facility as no one else in her family really had the space/or money.

(I'm still kindly pissed that she did that without talking to me first, but at the time I knew how hard she was grieving her grandfather's death and I didn't want to start an argument or cause conflicts with any of her family members)


I love my wifes grandmother, but she has been nothing but a burden to take care of the past year. She's severely diabetic and has to take 13 different medicines at different times of the day. She can only eat certain foods, which means me and my wife have to cook way more often. We have to constantly monitor her blood sugar. She can only walk very short distances with the use of a cane or walker, needs help dressing herself, bathing herself, going to the bathroom, climbing stairs, has doctors appointments twice a week, etc. You get the picture, right?

I know that I'm partially at fault for not saying anything and just going along with it, thinking that it wouldn't be forever, and my wife would eventually decide to send her to a facility. 

I'm a corporate lawyer, and I work remotely most days unless there's an important meeting or emergency that requires my presence at the office. That does mean that I'm at home most of the time to help out, but even though I'm remote, I'm still expected to be doing work during company hours. 

Me being constantly interrupted during the day has started to affect my work to the point that I find myself staying up later and later every night on my laptop playing catchup. And to be completely honest, patience is something is something that I never had, especially when it comes to dealing with the infirm. 

I just can't do it anymore, which is why, during breakfast this morning, I came clean to my wife and told her that I'm burnt out from being a caregiver. It's taking away from my career and our relationship, and it's time to consider other options for her grandmother. 

I tried to explain that it's too much on us, and we have the money for a very nice facility that has the resources to care for her 24/7. 

She blew up and called me a ""heartless monster"" for ""wanting to put such a sweet woman that's done so much for her family, community, and church in a nursing home."" She stormed out of the house, got in her car, and drove to her best freinds house.

Later today, she came back home and is now barely speaking to me

I'm starting to feel that maybe I was wrong

My Mom recently bought the house that she has been renting the past 13 years and is working on getting things squared with her will and beneficiaries along with the purchase. 

For some background, In 2023, my mom kicked me out of the house she just purchased. She threw all my shit to the curb and changed the locks on me. I ended up moving in with my boyfriend and we have been living together since (more context on how being kicked out in the comments of my previous AITA post). Months after she kicked me out, she tried to rekindle our relationship and offered to let me and my partner move back in. Because of the circumstances that I left that house and our current lease, I declined.

With the purchase of the house, she again, has been asking me to move back in. I told her that I didn't feel safe or secure moving back into her house with both her and my younger sister(21F) and that me and my partner just signed a lease for a rental house. Because I refused to move back in with her, she is not leaving me as one of the beneficiaries of the house and is solely leaving it to my sister. She is also leaving my sister with significantly more money from her life insurance policy because ""she'll need it to pay the mortgage"". 

I feel that she's giving me an ultimatum to move back in or I get practically nothing from her inheritance. I also grew up in that house and have a lot of memories tied to it.

Lucas is generally a sweet and nice kid, he's friendly, he's very open, etc. He likes to read comics and draw, I think he's pretty good at it. I'm really proud of him, I couldn't wish for a better son. 
Anyway, Lucas has been visiting my sister (28F) for 3 days. My sister has a son (8M) Gabriel. I was hoping Lucas would be friends with him. I exchanged messages with Lucas and he always said it's going okay. 

Yesterday, I went to my sister's house to pick up Lucas and she looked really hurt. Lucas was sitting there glum as well. I asked what was wrong and my sister told me to ask my son that question. 
It took me a long time to convince Lucas to tell me the truth, and he finally admitted what was wrong. 

As I understand it, Gabriel was curious about what Lucas was drawing (he had his sketchbooks with him). Lucas let him see his sketchbooks, but told him that Gabriel should handle them carefully. 

But when Lucas was outside, Gabriel (with his mother's permission, as I understand it, and I'm not excusing her for this) decided to check Lucas's things. When Lucas returned to the house, he found his sketchbooks torn up. I mean, I'm not excusing what Gabriel did. 

But according to my sister, my son didn't want to call me or my husband and he didn't want to hear Gabriel's excuses. He threw a tantrum and called Gabriel a ton of names, even though my sister said he was just a kid. All these days the atmosphere in the house was tense, my sister didn't call me because she was offended.  

My sister said she didn't even know if she would still want me or my son at their house after that. 
I said Lucas should apologize to Gabriel and his mom. Lucas was offended, but did so. 

When we go to home, I asked why Lucas didn't tell me that Gabriel had torn up his sketchbooks. Lucas cried and said, ""Because you never care."" Those words hurt me deeply and were a low blow because I really love my son and I didn't think he could say those words to his own mom. But I promised him that I would buy him new sketchbooks and he could redraw his drawings in them.

64,1dlbf9h,AITA for being hurt that I'm how excluded from my girlfriend's birthday?,"So my [22M] Girlfriend's [25F] birthday is in 2 days. We both are very busy with our careers and see each other 2-3 times in a two week span. We've been dating for 3 years as of last week. I made plans for her birthday, bought gifts, made dinner reservations she asked for. Everything was set to go. She told me two days ago that her friend is flying down from California to see her, and it was going to be a surprise. 

My gf lives with her parents. Her mom is sick and she takes care of her. We had agreed I'd spend the night with her on her birthday, as she wanted to sleepover with me but be close to her mom. Now that her friend is coming she has told me there will be no room for me. I live about 3 hours away, so we usually have sleepovers since it's 6 hours of driving. Due to there being no room, I am now uninvited from seeing her for her entire birthday. 

I was to be clear, I'm not angry at her. She didn't know her friend was surprising her. I'm extremely hurt because I planned everything and now I'm completely excluded.

We both are very busy with our careers and see each other 2-3 times in a two week span. We've been dating for 3 years as of last week. I made plans for her birthday, bought gifts, made dinner reservations she asked for. Everything was set to go. She told me two days ago that her friend is flying down from California to see her, and it was going to be a surprise. 

My gf lives with her parents. Her mom is sick and she takes care of her. We had agreed I'd spend the night with her on her birthday, as she wanted to sleepover with me but be close to her mom. Now that her friend is coming she has told me there will be no room for me. I live about 3 hours away, so we usually have sleepovers since it's 6 hours of driving. Due to there being no room, I am now uninvited from seeing her for her entire birthday. 

I was to be clear, I'm not angry at her. She didn't know her friend was surprising her. I'm extremely hurt because I planned everything and now I'm completely excluded.

65,1dlbdji,AITA for not giving a tennis lesson?,"Me (16f) and my little bro (14m) were on a road trip with our Dad for a tennis tournament. After a long drive yesterday, we hit the courts this morning for some practice before hitting the road again. We wanted to be sure we didn't show up late for the tourney, so we planned our practice to finish right on time. Dad dropped us off at a public court and would come about 80 minutes later. I get pretty stressed before tournaments, so I like to practice longer. About half an hour into our practice, this couple showed up with their kids—two little boys and two teenage girls. They set up a couple courts away, and we all got on with our own business. During a water break, I peeked over at their court. They seemed like beginners as they used green dot balls meant for younger kids. 

Back on my court, out of nowhere, the mom marches over and tells me to stop playing because I'm doing it all wrong. I was taken aback but asked what she meant. She starts lecturing me about how to hit the ball flat and straight, not curving like I was doing.(I've been playing since I was six and won state titles along with coming top three in nationals at my old country, so I think I know my stuff) I thanked her but politely said I play better my way. Then she accused me of being rude and ageist, but she shut down after I mentioned my successes. She asked for which school I played and what grade I was and then after giving me a compliment she went on her way. My brother accidentally hit a ball onto their court but instead of giving it back, she tossed me one of their old green dot balls, totally different from my brand-new ones. I told her those weren't ours, and she started calling us spoiled rich brats, assuming we're loaded. Yeah, my parents are okay financially, but I work hard to pay for my tennis gear and lessons. Luckily, one of the kids ran over with the right ball. We went back to our practice, focusing on my weakest spot—serving. 

Around 20 minutes before we had to leave, she came at me again, demanding I give her kids a lesson since I supposedly had skills and I owed her for the advice she gave me and the ball she returned. I refused because I wanted all the time I could get to work on my serve before the tournament. She started yelling and making snarky comments, which made me stressed and and hit badly for the rest of practice, which she watched from the back of the court behind me. My brother, who hates confrontation, suggested I just give in and help them out, but I refused to lose focus on what I needed. As we finished up, the mom yelled that she hopes I lose tomorrow, that I'm a horrible and disgusting person, and then threatened to call my school to get me kicked off the tennis team. I told my Dad what happened, and he and my brother said I should've just given the lesson to avoid drama and that it's my fault along with my big head if I get kicked off the team.AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for not giving a tennis lesson?

66,1dlbd66,AITA for telling my bro I don't like who he's becoming?,"Not exciting but I would  like advice.

My brother (33M) and I argued last night over something to do with my mother. He didn't appreciate my interactions with her and a message I sent in the group chat (not aimed at him). It's a unique situation and not entirely relevant perhaps to this post so I will skip to the climax soon - but he felt a message sent in the group chat was unnecessary and would stress out our mother, who is in a very busy period currently. We are all supporting her, admittedly my brother moreso as they work in the same field/share interest in her current project. But he berated me and bullied me for sending this message, I joked/laughed it off but felt like it was an over reaction.

He admitted he reacted harshly after I messaged him from my room to explain my position. But then went on to explain why his behaviour was proportionate and emotionally dump on me . I said I wasn't prepared to console him for mistreating me. He then went off, saying ""oh, so it's all my fault is it?"" and similar things. Before, imo, manipulating the chain of events to implicate me as some stirrer who was gaslighting him - I never said ""it's all on you"", he did! I never blamed him, or even had a go until he started trying to blame me.

I said to him, as he attempted to belittle/lecture me as though I was standing trial, that ""I think you need to reflect on the person you've become or seem to be becoming"". He replied, ""what? a bastard?!"" with glee, because he meant a tough guy who doesn't take shit. I replied ""No, that would imply toughness and I don't see that.."". I was going to say, I see a vulnerable person who needs to take a break and find a way to switch. Before I could say this he said ""Oh, so I should just k\*\*\* myself then?"" to which I said ""OMG, NO. I didn't say that and I wouldn't"" (for context I have attempted before, as far as I know he hasn't). He then said, ""well you knew that I would think that, to k\*\*\* myself though!"". I packed up my stuff and got out of there - shaking visibly and said ""I'm going to leave because I can't sit here and be held responsible for your thinking or be accused of saying things to initiate your Sui\*\*de."" I felt like words were being put in mouth and thoughts projected onto me in a really unfair way.

I'm worried about him, because his grasp of what happened last night seemed off and he struggled to recall basic elements of the interactions when asked. He had been drinking, I don't know how much .I don't think he's sui but I know he is stressed.

AITA? Part of me wishes I hadn't said it but my siblings think it, our other parents (broken homes for the win) also think it. What should I do?

67,1dlawzp,AITA for telling my gay best friend about a guy I like? ,"I have a friend who is a lesbian. She used to be my very best friend until yesterday. Recently I have been telling her about a guy I like. I'll admit, I may have been slightly overbearing; telling her about his eyes and his smile etc. But yesterday she snapped. 
She got very upset and told me that it was insensitive of me to tell her about a boy I liked whilst I knew she was gay. Mind you, she knew I was straight. I told her I didn't understand the problem because she didn't even like me in that way, so what was the problem if I told her about a boy in my life? She constantly told me about the girls in hers. She said I would never understand and now she is ghosting me. 
I am 17 (F) my friend is 16(F).
AITA for telling her about my crush? 

Edit: Thank you all for your suggestions. I saw an updated comment stating how I should handle this situation and I decided to proceed with that course of action. Since you all have been so supportive I decided to edit this original post and say what happened as a result :) 
Today, she ripped my bracelet (a friendship bracelet I had made, she also has a matching pair) off my wrist whilst we met randomly at the store. I grab her hand and tell her she needs to come to my house, so we can discuss what the hell was going on with her. She was about to mouth off on me when she saw I had tears in my eyes and finally relented. We went back to my place and I asked her what she was feeling, and why she was feeling that way etc. 
She admitted she liked me for some time now. She said she had approached me purely because I quote unquote LOOKED GAY and when she found out I wasn't, she decided to be my friend instead. I calmly held her hand and told her that I cared deeply about her, as she was a very good friend to me, but I just couldn't reciprocate in that way because I was straight and did not have any feelings for her. It would have been fine if it had ended there, but it didn't. 
She started crying and I tried to comfort her. I told her it was okay for her to feel like this, and whatever course of action relating to our friendship would be taken based of her to give her control of her situation, as I felt like I was being a bit demanding of her. I made it clear I did not want to date her. She then proceeded to kiss me. Without my consent. 
I leapt away, obviously, and didn't say anything for a bit. I couldn't. I didn't know what I was feeling. Then I politely asked her to leave. She slammed the door in my face when she left. I was disgusted and I felt bad for being so disgusted. I blocked her, but not before leaving a final goodbye. I do not think I am going to speak to her again. 
But thank you all for helping. I have one less cause of stress to deal with now :))

my family is extremely tight-knit and my grandparents were like second parents to me. when i lost my grandpa at 16, i kind of grew up and became an emotional support for the family, especially my mother, which i recognize might not be the most healthy. i’m working that through with my therapist lol

so yesterday i got the news, and my family made the wake and funeral plans while i was waiting to get coverage to leave work. they told me when i got home that the wake is scheduled for this tuesday, at a time that conflicts with my boyfriend’s nursing school graduation. i said no worries, i will stay at the wake for as long as i can (about 2 of the 4 hours it is scheduled to run) and then leave for the ceremony. this means i will have been there to grieve with my family from the time i left work thursday until the funeral brunch this coming wednesday (i cancelled all my shifts until then), save two hours of the wake and the night afterwards. i got the impression yesterday that that was fine with everyone.

for context, i’m living home after graduating college. my boyfriend (m23) and i have been together for almost three years, we plan on moving in together in a year or two and intend to spend our lives together.

this morning i wake up to go talk to my mom, and she says that she thinks i should stay for the whole wake and leave afterwards to make the dinner after my partner's ceremony. the reasons she cited were to think of my little cousin (f17) (who i'm very close with and supported through her very recent first breakup), and to think of my middle or high school friends coming and me not being there. i just couldn’t think of anything to say so i said i’d think about it, she said ""well i've said my piece"" and i walked out.

so far i still want to go. my partner said he wouldn’t be upset if i didn’t come, but i realized that wouldn’t change my decision at all and that i want to be there for him regardless. we have become a part of each other’s families and part of that for me is splitting my dedication to my family and to him, even if that means making a sacrifice.

later my mom could sense i was out of it, and when i said i still want to go she just sighed and walked away. my aunt started saying the same things my mom said, and then finally said “and your mom needs you too.” i said to them “if it was (f17 cousin)’s prom night, would you ask her not to go?” and my mom said “that is a family matter, (bf) isn’t family. the day is for the family to be together and grieve, and you have to think of grandma.” my mom is not the “you have to do what i say when you live under my roof” type at all, but i’m worried about creating a significant rift with my mom and my aunt.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"WIBTA if i left my grandma's wake for my partner's graduation? i (f22) just lost my grandma yesterday, it’s been very hard on me and my family but we all are able to look at it in a positive light. i made my peace with the matter months ago, she hadn’t been doing well. i am happy with the time i spent with her and have no regrets about our relationship.

I've repeatedly explained to him that I'm not okay with him smoking nearly every day with his dad and how hurt it makes me feel. He's a completely different person when he's high and I often feel disrespected, unwanted, and unloved when he's under the influence. He often ignores me or only half-listen to what I say and if there's something I need to get off of my chest or something we need to talk about as a couple, he either puts it off until never or is completely unserious about it. I've explained that I don't feel comfortable around him when he's high and that he's been hurting me by doing so. He keeps telling me that ""it's not a big deal"" and that ""I should be more okay with it,"" but I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong when I'm asking him to stop. He's becoming more hostile and unapproachable when he's not high and I feel like his smoking habits may be influencing that. I'm certainly not an expert on weed, but I know what it does to a person and how it affects them as many people in my family are complete drug addicts.

His habits have been repeatedly damaging our relationship. He's lying to me about weed, keeping things from me about weed, and just blowing up whenever I bring it up at all. I've been so patient and understanding with him about everything but he's becoming a real asshole and I just don't know what to do. I feel extremely disrespected and unloved when it comes to him and weed. I would do this for him in a heartbeat and I don't understand why he wouldn't for me either. He recently confronted me and told me to stop asking him to stop and I explained where I was coming from, whereas he didn't listen. He told me was going to keep smoking and that there was nothing I could do about it.

This whole thing makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, disrespected, and frankly unloved. I'm tired of feeling like I'm losing him over weed and he's calling me the asshole for feeling this way.

72,1dl9sv2,AITA I bragged about and expensive date to my abusive mom,"I suppose she was not abusive enough to keep me from doing such a thing. She was extremely selfish jealous and strategically abusive as a teenager and abandoned the family w/ false accusation my senior year. I moved back in with her 2 years ago in a time of need and her behavior was a little more respectful mind the minor domination or… I don’t know how to explain it.

So besides being humored by my bad luck in dating I found someone who seems to genuinely love me and picked up an attitude from her . We are going on a very expensive date after 2 months of dating (26F, 29M) I decided to tell her knowing her response may not be so good. I was hoping she would have gotten over this jealousy since she was raised the prettiest in a large family and most successful in school often bragged about it to me as a child saying very hurtful things about my place or you get the gist.

So she has been complaining all week making demands name calling and silent treatment. I think she got over it yesterday.

73,1dl9qph,"AITA for keeping all my roommates belongings after they moved out, despite them wanting it back?","I (21f) used to live with two roommates (both 21f) in an off-campus student housing apartment. We used to be friends prior to moving in but ultimately we did not get along as they were disrespectful of my property and our shared space. They both found housing for next year while I decided to stay in the same apartment unit.

The apartment staff clearly stated that they were required to clean every apartment before the next tenant arrived thus everything had to be empty before leaving. However since I renewed my lease, I could keep everything in my room but I had to leave the living room and kitchen completely empty. 

The day before my roommates moved out, they asked me if they could keep some of their boxes with me and I said 'no'. I was going home for the summer that day and I thought I made it clear that they had to find other arrangements.

I received an email a week ago stating I was fined $900 for failure to clean my space. I drove to my student housing apartment the same day to check on my apartment and speak to the housing staff. When I got to my apartment, I noticed several things still in my living room. These were my roommates like their T.V., vacuum, water purifier, dish rack, rice cooker, toaster, rug, coach pillows, ottoman, boxes, etc. 

I spoke to the apartment staff and explained none of these things were mine and instead were my roommates, thus I shouldnt have been fined. However, they explained that my roommates were no longer on the lease as of late May, thus any belongings in there would be by responsibility. In the end, they basically said there was nothing they can do and I had to pay the fine- which was a lot of money, so my summer savings were basically gone in an instant.

When I got home, I messaged my roommates and told them about the situation. They gave a half ass apology and said they assumed it wouldn't be an issue since I had the lease and we all collectively used some of the stuff they left, thus was technically my responsibility too. I asked them to both pay me $450 each to cover the fine. They said 'no'.

To that I said, ""Yeah, we all used those things. But now they're all mine. I had to pay the fine, I'm gonna keep everything you guys left.""

They began to freak out and spam messaged me about how I'm being an asshole for keeping their personal belongings. I ignored the messages. After they got on social media and blasted me for being a thief. I had many of their friends harass me. Now they're getting their parents involved, but so am I. I know whatever they left was probably worth more than the fine, but I'm not going to pay for someone else's carelessness. They assumed they could just come over after the summer and retrieve their stuff while bypassing the need to buy a storage unit or find other arrangements to store their stuff.

74,1dl9qfc,AITA for giving my sister the silent treatment after she yelled at me one time too many?,"Alright, I'll preface this by saying I(26), my sister(30)and my mom live together. I pay rent and some bills and contribute to general expenses, and my sister contributes  grocery while mom is retired. I've always been clear about the fact that I always want mom to live with me because I'm incapable of having kids, and so I've sorta decided I'll just take care of her in the future and I'm vibing with that. My sister, however, clearly doesn't like living with us. She always goes on rants about how she just can't take it anymore, how I'm too lazy to live with.

She has been getting more agitated through the years, but these past months it's gotten insane. She'd climb ontop of me while I'm asleep to take my charger, waking me up, but if I so much as open my mouth about she sets off. She'd use my stuff without asking,but if I point it out she'd yell at me while not even allowing me to touch her things.

I usually clean the kitchen (and the living room and hallways and balcony), and she gets to clean just the kitchen maybe once or twice a week and when she does, she starts going ""look I clean so much better"" and when she finds me cleaning, she'd wait until I'm done, look for any missed spots and yell and start saying how dirty I am and stuff like that. Or, worse yet, she'd hover over me and micromanage what I do.

And she comments on everything. My style is disgusting and ugly. My job is shitty for hiring me because who'd hire someone who dresses like me. I eat too much x, I'm lazy for eating a lot of noodles, cheap for shaving instead of using laser, etc. Before I wore a hijab she'd say my natural hair was a mess and I needed to straigten it, after wearing a hijab she shifted the complaints to me not knowing how to style my hijab.

Two nights ago, after making noodles and sitting down to eat them, she told me to go clean the pot I used immediately. She didn't want to use it, she just wanted me to go clean it immediately. I went ""I will in a few because I'm feeling dizzy,"" and she got angry and suddenly switched to ordering me to arrange my closet because she didn't like how it looked.

I told her I won't, that it wasn't affecting her and she just went and dumped the entire thing on my bed.

At that point I snapped, and just walked off. And since then whenever she starts talking to me, I just walk off. I have decided not to talk to her unless she apologised.

Last night. I heard her telling mom she got in an argument in work because of me. Because she was so angry at me she couldn't sleep and she yelled at work because of that.

My problem here is that I'm not sure if I really am lazy and making her life difficult as she says, and I  know that the silent treatment is abusive, but I don't know what else I can do. I have tried talking to her calmly before but she gets this look of disgust on her face and then I can't be calm anymore.

My sister got upset, because she said she wanted the money to be split down the middle and then use the excess from her half for later expenses like a down payment or something. She thinks I’m an AH for asking to split it unevenly, and says I’m stealing her money.

78,1dl8ta0,AITA for calling a little kid gay?,"To preface this, I (14M) am no homophobe at all. I’ve had my share of bi-curiousness as a part of growing up though I consider myself straight as of now. I also live in a South American country which, while isn’t overtly homophobic there are still many people who joke around about being gay as many teenagers do. In fact, the direct Spanish translation to the F-slur is a common phrase used in day to day language and is used in the same way as “bro”. 

Anyway, I was walking out of school with my friend saying stupid stuff as any teenagers would and there were some kids on the soccer field playing. As we are walking by, one of the kids balls rolls out of the court, and my friend kicked the ball back to them. In an act that completely flew out of my mind and I greatly regret now, I have no idea what happened in my brain but I just asked the kid “hey, are you gay”? There was literally nothing to spark this comment, my stupid teenage brain just decided to say it. It was then when I found out that his dad was on the benches and he heard what i had said. Instant regret came over me as I saw the man standing up and saying “hey, what’s wrong with you?” “Are you mentally ill? How will you fix this, are you going to a psychologist?” At this point, all I could say was just apologize. I knew it was a very stupid thing that I did and I have no idea what came to my mind. I profusely apologized and he told me to not come a meter close to any of these kids ever again. He was treating me as if I was a criminal and even took a picture of me (it’s illegal to take pictures of minors in my country) at this point all I could do was go home and tell my mom about this. I live like 2 blocks away from my school so I quickly went to tell her and she told me ok, let’s go back and apologize and also tell him to delete my picture. We went back to my school and my mom told the guy that we are very sorry about my stupidity and that this really never happens. I swear I’m not normally like this. The man told my mom he believed I was a threat and he told her he would THINK about deleting my picture. In the end, the man went to cool off a bit then came back and deleted the picture. This is when we shake hands, me and my mom leave and this is where we stand now. My mom told me that I need to think of a way to make it up to the man, which I think is fair however he was literally treating me like a criminal. He kept calling me  mentally ill and claimed I’d done psychological damage to his son (his son was no older than like 9 btw). My mom said I should go do service at the football academy at least once a week however I told her that while I do want to make it up to them, I don’t want to see that guy again and I don’t think he wants to see me either.

My mom said I should go do service at the football academy at least once a week however I told her that while I do want to make it up to them, I don’t want to see that guy again and I don’t think he wants to see me either. 

So Reddit, what do you guys think?
Personally I think it’s an everyone sucks but it’s up to y’all

79,1dl8ov1,AITA for blocking a friend after he brought his friends and ditched me on our date?,"(Personal details omitted)

I (15f) have a friend (15m) that I have known for a few months now through school. It's now summer vacation and we have continued to talk, and even flirt a bit. I suggested we should hang out at an ice cream place in our area that's super popular. He asks me when, and I tell him anytime works except 3:00 to 4:00 since I had a drum lesson.

So I go to my lesson and open my phone to find out that at 3:05 this guy texts me to ask me if it was ok if he brought friends and follows up with ""I'll take your silence as a yes."" I honestly couldn't tell if he was joking or not. I go in line to order and as I'm in getting my ice cream, he shows up with two of his friends (they go to our school but I don't know them particularly well) and his twin brother. I was furious because although I had said we should just ""hang out"" I pretty heavily implied it was a date. He didn't say anything to me even though he obviously saw me as I went to go grab a table.

He orders with his friends and when they get their ice cream, his friends garb a separate table and he just stands there with them for like five minutes. I texted my friend saying I didn't even know if he was going to walk over and talk to me. Eventually though he does and we talk. I don't mention him bringing ppl even though I really wanted to. It was fun and he mentioned that he ran there. The place he lives is fairly far away and you have to take a highway, so I was touched by that.

After a little his friends come over and say they're going to go to the fast food restaurant near the ice cream place. I turn and talk to his brother and we exchanged pleasantries since he was the only one of the group of friends I was comfortable with. I turn back and my ""date"" has left with his friends. He didn't say goodbye or invite me, he just left.

I felt so upset and embarrassed and rejected. I had to sit at that ice cream place by myself for a solid ten minutes as I waited for my dad to pick me up. When I told my parents they called him a moron and my brother said he might have even just done it for the laughs. I promptly blocked him but I can't help but feel bad. He could've just felt really sociably awkward and nervous, explaining why he invited friends and even left. I also never explicitly called it a date. But if he wanted to have friends, he knew I had the lesson and couldn't get friends of my own to come. I don't think he handled the situation well, but it's summer break and I've blocked him so even if he felt guilty and wanted to apologize he can't. Should I unblock him? AITA? I'd love advice from older ppl with more experience.

80,1dl8c9j,AITA for being a little uncomfortable on contributing a lot of money for my brother's baby shower? ,"Edit: Wow First off thank you all so much for your responses!  I honestly felt like such a bad sister with all this, but feeling so much better now.  I took so many of your tips and suggestions, and had a conversation with my brother about setting my firm budget and what he can expect from me and explained my situation.  He was actually very understanding and apologized for any anxiety he caused me.  Hopefully he continues to be understanding.  Thank you all so much! 

So quick facts I (30 F) have a brother (33M).  He and his husband (34M) are in the process of adopting 2 babies from 2 different women.  My brother makes about 95K and his husband makes about 80K, both are teachers in high paying districts.  I am a single person and make about 60K (also a teacher) and I just bought a house last year.  I do not get paid over the summer, and I am in 2 weddings coming up which also takes a lot of money.

My brother and his husband are understandably very excited and want to have a baby shower to help get stuff for possibly 2 babies.  One baby is due Sept 26th and the other is Oct 15th.  Here is where things get a bit dicey.  They (mostly my brother) wants to have a big fancy baby shower with possibly 100 guests or more.  He said it will be like a mini wedding and even got into a fight with his MIL about the cost of a venue and expecting them to shell out the money for it.  She called him spoiled and he got very offended.

Of course I want to help out as much as I can I offered to make the invitations and to help organize stuff.  But as I talked with my brother I realized just how much he is expecting me and his SIL (31 F) to contribute since all the parents and themselves are paying over $6,500 for the venue/food/drink.

From what I understand he mentioned we would cover decorations, center pieces, favors, setting up, doing the seating chart - which is reasonable.  But then he started to mention a mini bottles of Champagne for each person as a favor, a photo booth, and other extras like that, on top of a gift.  (I was told I could get the other crib or bassinet since SIL is getting one about $350.)  When I said all of that is a lot of money he said ""Just be glad I'm not asking you to contribute to paying for the venue like I was going to originally do"".

Of course I want to spoil my nieces and to help out as much as I can, and maybe it's that they just expect me to put out all this money without asking.  I've also always been the money conscious one and even helped bail my bother out of credit card debt a few years ago.  (just 3K and he did eventually pay me back).

My parents also do majority of the grocery shopping and they have no considerstation when it comes to that .. they will have the same food item 5 times a day and finish it (leaving none for me) instead of cooking something else because they both do not like to cook. When there is little food in the house or only items that need to be cooked (can't throw in the oven/ air fryer) they complain about there not being any food in the house but refuse to go the grocery store and buy any items for the house. They have money for themselves and their extracurriculars but they never have any money to put towards food and they just depend on my parents to always cover food. 

Which then I come in; I always buy food to make, I cook at least everyday or every other day if there is left overs. Then I am expected to share the food I make and bought with my own money with everybody in the house (I don't mind sharing with my parents). But I feel at this point I'm taking care of grown adults who purposely chose not to contribute because they assume someone else is going to do it, and it's really starting to get to me especially now because I am pregnant.

So now he's paying back (this is important). He lives with my parents (77F, 79M) and literall pays one bill...the cable which he is 2 months behind on. 

OK now on to the conflict. For the past 3 months my parents have paid the bill because he claims his whole check is being taken for child support, leaving him with less then 100. 2 days ago I had to go in his room to get clothes for my niece and the idiot left all his paystubs and bank statements laying open on the dresser. Long story short, he's lying about the money. So my parents have been suffering and budgeting more, I already help them with groceries and such. Meanwhile he is out and about with his girlfriend and buying my youngest niece sneakers and clothes. He claimed his girlfriend gave him the money. 

Now this has all come out, my mom knows and is extremely hurt, especially since he lives there and sees her stressing out. Also, we are moving to FL so I can better care for my parents and could use the money they are spending towards the moving costs.

86,1dl61f7,AITA for telling my friend about an opportunity I have at a well-known theater,"So for context I (17f, just finished my junior year of high school) am hoping to work as a screenwriter/director as an adult.  However, my mom (52f) works with people in the industry and in theater as well, and most think majoring in film/going to a four year film school isn't worth it.  My mom also thinks I should broaden my horizons and learn about other things as well so I can use it to inform my work.  (I'm also interested in marine biology, so I'm fine with that idea.)  

But I have a third option, too - working in the costume department at the theater where my mom works as their physical therapist.  It's a well-known theater, and while my mom working there would definitely be helpful in getting the job, I am also experienced as a dresser (someone who helps actors change costumes throughout a show) and love working with costume design.  I made my own Halloween costume last year (I was a Twi'lek and built the lekku/did my makeup by myself and tbh I think it looked better than Disney's stuff lmao) and I plan to do so again for Comic Con and Halloween this year (as Ahsoka Tano and Nux from Fury Road respectively.  Plus, the theater is apparently always in need of dressers.  

Anyway, about two weeks ago, my friend (16m, also a junior) and I were talking about college (something we did a lot this past year since we're both juniors and we're both very ambitious) and I mentioned this to him because my mom had just brought it up that day and I thought it sounded great but wanted a second opinion because a gap year is a big decision.  He got a bit upset because he said it sounded like I was bragging.  I felt hurt because I genuinely wanted to discuss it with him but he made it sound like I was one of those celebrity kids who starts acting because their parents got them a job.  I'm not.  My mom believes in hard work and didn't even tell me this was a guarantee.  All she'd be doing is putting in a good word for me, which would help of course but the theater wouldn't hire me unless I proved myself to be a good worker (it's a union shop).

87,1dl60bo,AITA Blink 182 concert hell,"So I went to my first huge concert last night, Blink 182 at the kia center. everything was going amazing and having a great time with both the openers and an amazing set from pierce the veil. 

Blink 182 comes on and the people two rows in front of me stood up, was fine at first just thinking it was for their intro on stage and when they walked in but they never sat down. We were in nosebleeds almost at the top of the arena btw and no one in our section was standing except for them. 

The couple in front of us was getting clearly upset and they struggled to see as well, even when standing and ended up moving to empty seats in their row. I tried everything in my power to make the situation work to try and be a considerate but about halfway through blinks set i decided to go say something.

Went to the bathroom, came back and walked up to her and smiled and politely said “hi! it’s my first concert ever and i’m having a hard time seeing even when standing up, would you guys be okay with sitting down?” and she responded with “it’s a concert, you’re supposed to stand” to which i replied, i struggle with standing for long periods of time being physically disabled. then she pointed to the disabled seating and told me i should’ve purchased those tickets instead and justified her need to stand by the fact that she drove three hours.

",No A-holes here,2024-06-21,"AITA Blink 182 concert hell So I went to my first huge concert last night, Blink 182 at the kia center. everything was going amazing and having a great time with both the openers and an amazing set from pierce the veil. 

Blink 182 comes on and the people two rows in front of me stood up, was fine at first just thinking it was for their intro on stage and when they walked in but they never sat down. We were in nosebleeds almost at the top of the arena btw and no one in our section was standing except for them. 

The couple in front of us was getting clearly upset and they struggled to see as well, even when standing and ended up moving to empty seats in their row. I tried everything in my power to make the situation work to try and be a considerate but about halfway through blinks set i decided to go say something.

Went to the bathroom, came back and walked up to her and smiled and politely said “hi! it’s my first concert ever and i’m having a hard time seeing even when standing up, would you guys be okay with sitting down?” and she responded with “it’s a concert, you’re supposed to stand” to which i replied, i struggle with standing for long periods of time being physically disabled. then she pointed to the disabled seating and told me i should’ve purchased those tickets instead and justified her need to stand by the fact that she drove three hours. Was pretty upset but there was nothing i could do once blink started another song but they continued to stand.

88,1dl5yd0,AITA for not giving partner first class seat,"(update: for clarification i am **NOT** upgrading i would never do this.. we are non-rev. this means we dont have seats yet until the gate... there are 10 empty seats open (5 first class, 5 coach) theyre given out based on employee status, so i am listed as number 4, he is number 8. there is a chance we both could get coach. i am not upgrading my seat though, we dont get to sit by each other regardless already)  

For context, I planned a two-week trip for their birthday as a surprise and paid for all of the accommodations and travel necessities. I've spent \~ 3k already. Luckily, I have non-rev tickets to fly standby, (I still paid over 1k for our tickets though) but I am on a higher status on the list because I'm a family member and they aren't. So, It looks like there's a chance I may get first class, and they wouldn't. They're saying they're mad at me, and I'm rude because I don't want to trade my ticket sit in coach.

Their reasoning is it's because it's their birthday and a trip I planned for them, so I should let them have the first class spot since they've never flown first class (mind you I've only flown first class like twice in my life like 16 years ago).Also it's not like I just upgraded my ticket or bought one first-class seat, I would never do that. I'd 100% want to sit by them but there's only middle seats and first-class seats left.

Realistically we'll probably both be in coach, but now I'm upset. I told them I feel really unappreciated like nothing is good enough since I've already paid for everything and planned this whole surprise trip.. and now I should also give up my first class seat too? It just hurts my feelings, but they said they're not apologizing and their feelings justified and I could ask anyone and they'd totally see how rude I'm being...so what are your thoughts, am I actually being unreasonable here?

89,1dl5wze,AITA for not including my sister when I bought a gift for our mom’s birthday,"My sister(40f) lives in the States while me(36f), my husband, my brother and his wife live in Japan. 

Last year, I went to a shopping center to have my phone repaired. Coincidentally, my brother and his wife had errands to do there as well so we all went together. That same day was my mom’s birthday, so we were going to head straight to her birthday dinner after errands. 

While doing the errands, we came across a store that was selling a newer version of her phone. We talked about it amongst ourselves and decided to get the phone for our mom. 

One year later, my sister from the States finds out that we got my mom a new cellphone for her birthday last year and was upset that we didn’t include her. I explained to her it was a very last minute and impromptu decision and told her that i thought it would have been wrong to decide to buy such an expensive gift and then expect her to pay without consulting with her first. She said that now she feels guilty that she wasn’t able to give a nice gift to my mom and so upset that we excluded her when it involved me and brother which means it should have been a complete sibling thing. Am I an insensitive asshole?? 

Some info: We have occasionally pitched in for gifts for our parents but usually we discuss and make sure everyone is ok via chat first.

90,1dl5q7c,AITAH for not paying for my mom’s coffee?,"I (F21) am a student who recently went on holiday with my mom. Long story short, I think she is a narcissist, with anger issues and manipulative / shitty tendencies. Her and my dad have been seperated basically since I was born and our whole family is aware she can be crazy and reckless; especially when it comes to money. She is a single mom to me and my brother (M20) which is obviously very difficult with a low income job - but she doesnt help herself. She is a chronic overspender and has never listened to our advice on just going to cheaper supermarkets, not using ‘pay later’ schemes, not just buying new shoes and clothes every week etc. 

Anyway, over the course of this trip she kept offering to pay for dinners going ‘oh dont worry, ill get this’, randomly bought me a t-shirt, gave me her card to get a snack at the airport, etc. On the plane, she turns to me and says ‘Ive ran out of money so you need to buy me a coffee and some biscuits’. Personally I set aside around €200 and used the last €8 of this on souvenirs when we left so I said no and went back to sleep. Never heard anything else about it, and my brother paid for it.

We land all good, and as we are leaving the airport to go home Im laughing with my brother when she turns around and goes ‘you can shut your mouth you little bitch’. My brother and I go silent, and she proceeds to shout at me as if im a little kid as we walk through the airport, saying ‘you’re a nasty little bitch, pure evil, you cant buy your mom a coffee? i forget we’re actually related sometimes. i’m disappointed to call you my daughter. so disappointing.’ She also mentioned ‘I paid for a €70 meal but okay. I got you a tshirt.’ and basically threatened my with ‘oh dont worry, ill remember this.’ This continued for the 50 minute train ride home, with her passive aggressive comments to my brother talking about me as if im not there, and then followed by the silent treatment. I basically didn’t respond at all.

As a psychology major I feel like she has issues with anger, gaslighting, and using emotional manipulation. She came to my room today and denied she ever said any of the things mentioned about being disappointed that I’m her daughter etc. I feel like she forgets shes the mother, and we are broke students. She thinks she deserves automatic respect / obedience because shes our mom, but she has never earnt it.

I just think - why offer to pay for things if you know you cant afford it? Don’t offer things if you are just going to use them against people in future. Im sick and tired of her irresponsible behaviour with money being my problem - especially when im real deep in my overdraft now with rent and bills to come out on the 1st July. Yeah I couldve paid a couple euros for the coffee and biscuits, but she should learn that actions have consequences - if you cant afford it dont get it. It was a 3 hour flight as well. 

Ask me anything else if curious.

91,1dl5jx4,AITA for refusing to give up opportunities that come my way for my sister's sake? ,"My older sister Rita (20f) is disabled. My sister's disability comes with a lot of health issues and while mentally she's capable, physically she cannot do much and struggles and struggled even with regular school. She never graduated highs school because she got so sick in senior year that it set her way back and she didn't get the grades to graduate. She was offered the chance to repeat but she said no because she was still really bad afterward. It's something that causes her a lot of distress and she still cries because she feels like she failed in the worst way. Nobody can convince her differently. She doesn't work and she doesn't go to school or anything. She's at home and gets taken care of by our parents.

I (17f) am still in school and I'm going into my senior year. There have been a lot of discussions about college or what other avenue I could go down. I was given information on this apprenticeship that could be perfect for me and my guidance counselor wanted me to give it consideration over the summer because they take high school graduates. It's exciting.

Rita was super upset to hear I had so many options. And not for the first time my parents expected me to think of her before making decisions. They suggested I focus on looking at community colleges only or not going to college at all and going into retail or a service industry job. They told me I could afford my own place if I were  to do that.

I didn't get to go to camp because Rita couldn't and they didn't want me to have experiences she couldn't. I wasn't allowed to participate in school plays because Rita couldn't participate in hers (my parents would actually stop my teachers from including me). They refused to sign a permission slip that would have allowed me to enter a competition on behalf of my school, because Rita would never get to have an experience like that herself and they didn't feel it was right for me to have it then. The permission slip came in because some travel might be involved *if* I were to go anywhere. They pulled me out of art classes when I was young because I was doing super well and getting a lot of praise. My parents actually pressured me to ask if I could leave the classes. But they pulled me regardless.

Rita would always get upset when I achieved something or got presented with a great opportunity. She'd cry, ask me why I got everything and she got nothing. I felt bad for her but also resentful of the fact she was glad when our parents held me back.

This became a fight when the college stuff came up again and my parents saw me looking up the apprenticeship and my parents asked me how I could even think about going and how selfish I would be. They said I should aim for something lower for Rita's sake. Rita heard us argue about it and she said she knows I'm too selfish to give it up for her. I told them I hated them for expecting me to. Rita and my parents said I had no sense of family loyalty at all.

98,1dl4cyk,AITAH for not fighting for my stepmoms money?,"2 years ago (I was 22 & in college, now 24), my birth mother passed away suddenly. My stepmom stepped up and has been taking care of me ever since. For the first year, she paid all the bills exclusively because I was still in college and couldn’t get a job. She had to help pay for the last 2 months of tuition and rent before I moved back home with her and have been living here ever since. When I got a job after the first year, I’ve been paying my half of the utility and food bills but pay the taxes on the house 100%, as well as anything else that might need to be paid for like maintenance and upkeep.

My other mother, who I see frequently but don’t live with, has been here the whole time emotionally supporting me but not financially since I don’t live with her. Now she’s the trustee of my birth mothers trust (meaning she controls the money and if I want to access it I have to go through her). 

Recently, my step-mother has been getting very very upset with me that I don’t want to join her crusade against my other mother for money. She’s infuriated I won’t go up to my other mother and demand she pay back every single penny my step mother had to pay to help support me, even the day to day bills I couldn’t pay for while still attempting college. I feel like my step-mother is perfectly capable to be an adult and talk to my other mother herself, but she refuses to. 

My step mother is also infuriated that my other mother hasn’t offered to pay her back anyways, and takes personal offense that my other mother never initiated that conversation. Now, my step mother wants to involve lawyers and sue my other mother for the money she thinks she’s owed, despite having never even attempted to talk with her. Since it’s my step mother’s money and my other mother paying her back, I don’t want to get involved. It doesn’t feel like my place. Especially since I’m the beneficiary of the trust and don’t have any legal say over the trust. 

Side note: I do think my step mother should get paid back, but mainly only for the money she spent on my tuition, rent, and the funeral costs. She wants money for the everyday bills she’s paid. 

AITAH for not wanting to get involved or intimate this conversation with my other mother myself on behalf of my step mother, or joining my step mothers crusade against my other mother? 

Edit because it feels important: step-mom has supported me strictly financially and physically (helping pack up the house). Other mother has helped emotionally and morally, and has helped pay some of my personal medical bills, phone bills, and car insurance. 

Edit 2: I’m going to bring this up to my other mother at some point because my step mother makes life hell for me over this. I don’t think it should be my place to be the one to act like an adult and bring this up, especially since I’m a little over 1/3 the age of my step mother.

101,1dl2whl,WIBTA for suggesting my friends reconsider the name of their first born?,"(We live in Australia; Names have been changed)

My (M22) best friend Jay (M22) started dating his, now wife, Mia (F20) about 2 years ago. I did not meet Mia for over a year and she still hasn’t met most of our friends. We have been friends since high school and while I am extremely comfortable talking to Jay, I am more cautious when talking to Mia. I have not met her more than a handful of times and I don’t want to damage my relationship with Jay by upsetting Mia as he has already begun withdrawing a lot since moving in with her.

Mia and Jay are pregnant with their first child (F). He told me they were naming their child after their favourite anime character. The name is a preexisting English name and on its own its a completely normal name and I agreed that it was nice.

When the baby shower announcement was posted and they revealed they’d be using the first and last name of the character for the child, with the characters last name as the middle name. I won't use the child's real name but its similar enough to them naming the child **Lucy Heartfilia** or **Mina Ashido.**

The child is going to have a very unique last name as its hyphenated, and it's also going to make their name really long (think McLaren-Williams). I think the middle name is inconveniently long and out of place with their full name but it's not my main issue with it. Searches for the child’s first + last name turn up normal but her full name gives significantly different content. When my partner and I checked, we found explicit material in under a minute, even with safe search enabled.

If this child were to search her own name, she would likely come across explicit content of her namesake (a child). These results would be available to anyone with her full name including employers. As far as I am concerned the name poses significant problems regarding personal identity, bodily autonomy, and functionality for this child. I genuinely believe these are issues that have not occurred to them and will impact their child.

Despite this I feel it might make me an asshole to bring this up, most of my friends believe it would be rude to interject as this is *their* child. I am a fairly upfront person with my friends and have no intention of having children so I feel like giving my opinion here when I don't have any remotely relevant experience may be an asshole move. Especially because they are clearly set on the name and they really like it, I don't want them to feel bad, I just want them to reconsider due to the potential consequences down the line. I don't want them to feel like they haven't put enough thought into the child's name considering it was not a planned pregnancy.

TLDR; my best friend is naming their child after an anime character, using the full name and I believes they haven't considered the consequences the child will face as a result.

103,1dl2n1n,AITA for having an interest and doing something related to it?,"So a little background, I am 17M, 18 in a month, and I spent a major part of the last 2 years grinding for one of the toughest entrance exams in the world. I also happen to be very much interested in cars. Living in one of the biggest cities in my country, there is no shortage of cool cars around here. Due to my exam, I sacrificed going to a lot of car meets and shows, and I was fine with it, since in 2 years my exam would be over, I would get into the country's top engineering college in my city itself, and attend all these, right?

Wrong. My exam didn't go as well as planned, and though I am getting a top 5 college, I won't be getting into my preferred choice. So I thought, what's done is done, I can't do anything about it, so I may as well enjoy the last 2 months here in the city before I go to the college in a smaller town. So I got a couple of other car guy friends with me, and we went carspotting for an entire day, and it was one of the best days of my life.

Another friend of mine asked if I wanted to go carspotting again on Sunday, and I was like, sure why the hell not, I have nothing else to do.

Last night everything changed.

I keep a little notepad in which I note down any cool cars I have seen, and I was filling it in with what all we had seen recently. My dad called me for dinner, and I said just a moment, but he came in and saw what I was doing, gave me an ugly look, and told me to take dinner myself, and that his offer has expired.

At night when my mom returned from the office, we were discussing about what branch I should choose for my college, and suddenly my dad started ranting about priorities again, and how it wasn't a great achievement to see some stupid car and note it down like I have done something great. Then he sad that I'm completely wasting away my time, and instead of doing something to own a cool car myself, I am content with going and standing on the road on a 'wild goose chase' where a supercar may appear or not.

Then he started comparing me to the people who stand in front of the gate of the richest man in Asia hoping to get a glimpse of one of the cars in his massive collection, and called me a 'chapri'. In case you are unaware, a chapri is a kind of lowlife (highly derogatory term among young people) who thinks getting flashy hairstyles, tattoos who have no personality other than looking cool on social media.

Then he started saying how it was his mistake of introducing me to cars when I was younger and taking me to car meets etc. This hurt a lot, because he once took my to the capital 2000 km away while he had typhoid when I was 6 just so I could attend this biennial car show, and I want that version of him back instead of the one who calls me a chapri for spending a Sunday morning spotting cars.

I went to bed at 12 and couldn't sleep till 3 atleast because I was feeling so bad and like I had failed him (or he had failed me, I'm still confused)

So AITA for liking to spot cars?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for having an interest and doing something related to it? So a little background, I am 17M, 18 in a month, and I spent a major part of the last 2 years grinding for one of the toughest entrance exams in the world. I also happen to be very much interested in cars. Living in one of the biggest cities in my country, there is no shortage of cool cars around here. Due to my exam, I sacrificed going to a lot of car meets and shows, and I was fine with it, since in 2 years my exam would be over, I would get into the country's top engineering college in my city itself, and attend all these, right?

Wrong. My exam didn't go as well as planned, and though I am getting a top 5 college, I won't be getting into my preferred choice. So I thought, what's done is done, I can't do anything about it, so I may as well enjoy the last 2 months here in the city before I go to the college in a smaller town. So I got a couple of other car guy friends with me, and we went carspotting for an entire day, and it was one of the best days of my life.

Another friend of mine asked if I wanted to go carspotting again on Sunday, and I was like, sure why the hell not, I have nothing else to do.

Last night everything changed.

I keep a little notepad in which I note down any cool cars I have seen, and I was filling it in with what all we had seen recently. My dad called me for dinner, and I said just a moment, but he came in and saw what I was doing, gave me an ugly look, and told me to take dinner myself, and that his offer has expired.

105,1dl23zy,AITA for snitching on my friend to her boyfriend?,"I (22F) have been living with this girl for about a year. Let’s call her Jenny (22F). We became quite close over time, and I consider her a really good friend of mine. She has a boyfriend, Aiden (21M). Aiden studies in another state, and Jenny visits him every other month. However, Aiden flew down last week to stay with us. This was his first time visiting her in a year. It was also my first time officially meeting him. 

For background, Jenny is quite disorganized and barely takes care of herself. She’s not unhygienic or anything, but she will frequently wear the first thing she spots, barely bother doing her makeup except on special occasions and her room is often a mess with clothes and books strewn about. There’s nothing wrong with that, obviously, but it’s something we joke a lot about. To clarify, a lot of the times she cracks jokes at her own expense about how disorganized she is. I joke about it too sometimes, and she laughs. It’s never been something she’s offended by. 

However, the week before Aiden flew down, she cleared up her whole room. She also wore her prettier outfits and did her makeup the whole time he was here. It was kind of cute. So one day, Aiden was talking about how pretty and decorated her room is while we were all chatting in the living room. Jokingly, I added that it was all for his benefit, you should see the hurricane that passes through on a daily basis. Jenny didn’t seem to mind this bit, and just rolled her eyes and smiled. I added to it telling Aiden he should visit more often, because it brings out the best in her. Then I laughed saying that I got to see the real her, and he only saw the polished version. That he should see her, walking to college in a hoodie that she has worn a dozen times, with her hair matching the mess in her room. I didn’t even know she wore owned some of the outfits she was wearing with him here. Jenny didn’t respond to this, and I didn’t know it was a big deal until today.

Today, Jenny suddenly claimed that I deliberately insulted her in front of her boyfriend, and that she wasn’t sure why that remark was necessary to make. She thinks I was trying to act “superior” to her, and implemented mean girl strategies. She accused me of telling her boyfriend things that I had no business telling him about, and that it was up to her to talk about the way she normally lives. I really did not do any of this with a malicious intention though, and I tried to tell her the same. She was adamant that I was trying to justify it instead of acknowledging my mistake and apologizing. 

I don’t know what to do. I didn’t do this to hurt her, but I don’t know if I’m still wrong for doing it unintentionally. Was it really a big deal? AITA?

106,1dl1o2y,AITA for laughing at a girl singing karaoke? ,"Written on mobile sorry about any format issues

So last weekend my (25F) boyfriend (27M) went out for a friends birthday to a karaoke place. Important to note it was one of the ones where you rent out a private booth, you can order food and drink there and there’s one karaoke machine for everyone to take turns singing, but most the time it’s just everyone singing at once. 

It was a really good night, there were six of us in total and between us we all got relatively hammered. The song options they had were pretty limited to anything from the 80’s to the early 2010s and no one was taking super seriously.

One of the girls who we were with (I’ll call her Emma) has a crush on my boyfriend. They never dated and my boyfriend is (up until this story) clueless of her feelings. He doesn’t have a lot of confidence, is pretty shy and struggles at reading a room so has never really been able to tell at all despite how obvious Emma makes it. 

Now it’s Emmas turn to sing and like I said, all tipsy at least. She starts singing Taylor Swifts You Belong With Me (for anyone who doesn’t know the title basically implies what the song is about: your girlfriend sucks and I’ve always loved you)

At first we all started singing along with her but the more serious and intense it got the less people were laughing and joining in and just staring at me, as if to see what I would do. And I didn’t do anything, I smiled and clapped at the end. Who cares? This is her Rachel Berry, main character moment and it wasn’t really hurting anyone. My boyfriend looked mortified, I’ve never seen him look like he wanted to be swallowed by the ground more than in that moment. I figured this would be nothing more than a “I told you so” moment in the taxi ride home. 

The awkwardness eases somewhat until it’s Emma’s turn again. She gets up and sings at my boyfriend again. The. Same. Song. We’re all just staring at her, dumbfounded. Meanwhile she’s staring at my boyfriend who’s holding my hand so tightly as though he’s afraid he’s going to float away. It’s so tense and weird and I can’t help it, I laugh. Not a belly laugh but a  quick loud “HA” before instantly clapping my hand over my mouth. Emma storms out mid song, one of our friends follows her and we get a text saying they’re not coming back to the party.

It’s been almost a week and I got a text last night in the group chat calling me a bully and a mean girl for laughing, not by Emma, but the friend who followed her out. But I don’t know if I am. Tbh I think I deserve a damn medal for sitting through the first song without saying anything. 

TL;DR: I laughed at a girl who was serinading my boyfriend a second time with the same song.

Someone, let’s call him Jeff, sent a text saying he will touch Dylan’s sister, but later said it was a joke, Dylan was mad but still forgave him after he apologized, after Dylan sent that text I also sent a text saying the same thing, tho I have no idea what I was thinking when I said that, anyways I forgot to say I was just joking, leading to Dylan getting mad at me as well, the next day I apologized to Dylan, he told me that what I said was unacceptable and that I can’t say that, I told him why it’s ok if Jeff says it but not me, he said that Jeff specified it was a joke, to be fair I did forget to mention it was a joke, but I still think that it was clear that I wasn’t actually gonna touch his sister. Soon me and Dylan were no longer friends, which is okay because we weren’t that close anyways. A few weeks later Dylan was still mad, so he tells Jack, my other friend, to not be my friend anymore, and Jack is actually considering it, tbh Jack has know Dylan longer than me, Jack posted a story on Reddit to see what he should do, I have a few things against that, first of all one thing Jack forgot to mention is that he also makes jokes about religion, and disrespected religion in many ways, like saying that he should be worshiped as a god and that all religious people are bigots, leading him to lose one of his best friends who he has known for a long time, while I’m also religious when he said that I didn’t stop being friends with him, but Jack did for some time as he said that joking abt religion is unacceptable, while I agree I also think that me not cutting him off back then makes me a more loyal freiend than Jack, also I feel like Dylan is manipulating Jack into not being my friend, by implying that if he chooses to stay friends they will be less close if not stop being friends, so I tell Jack about all this, he tells me that I’m in the wrong for what I said. What should I do? Cuz I feel like I also wanna drop Dylan cuz he is constantly getting mad at me for having different political and religious views than he does, And he constantly disrespects religion and my world.

My gf asked me to at least tell her when there's jobs going. I told her I'd mention it to her but that I'm not going to ask the recruitment team to consider him or anything because I don't want my name associated with him which she agreed to.

111,1dkzbsi,AITA for confronting my dad about his treatment of me VS my brother?,"First, I don't want this post to be reposted anywhere on social media, for whatever that counts to somebody.

this is kind of a long story and I've never posted here before. I'm sorry if it breaks rules or if this isnt the place to post it. it also requires a lot of backstory

First, I want to say I am F15 and my brother is M19 (we'll call him jake) I will be sixteen in about two weeks. I really love my brother and we get along well. My parents love us very much and always say they have no favorite child, which i think is true

Since I started high school I have noticed how my parents tend to 'favor' my brother. They do things like pay more attention to him, buy him food/drinks because he refused to eat cafeteria food (hes extremely picky) but wont do the same for me. When he graduated high school last year, they ended up not putting any attention into my 10th grade school year, putting off any shopping until the VERY last minute, lots of stuff.

I also need to state this is where I may be the asshole. My brother is a type one diabetic. he was diagnosed in 2019, I was 12. He was 15 or 16. it's been about 5/4 years since then I've felt this way sometimes.



So, 

a couple days ago, Jake and my mom left to drop him off at a DCI camp. (professional marching band basically.) I was driving with my dad and I asked him what we were going to do for dinner. He said he was going to make a steak salad (a food I don't like to eat and he knows.) I asked if we could pick me up a 5$ meal from a grocery store. He said no. This is also where I believe i was an asshole. I retorted and said if it were jake who didnt want something, he would've bought him dinner he liked. My dad just sighed and said that he buys me things all the time. I pointed out that he does the same thing and more for jake. He said that jake was older and also said that he didnt have a favorite, again insisting that he spent an equal amount of money on us. 

So here the thing, DCI costs money. Its expensive. And the one my brother joined has fees of around 4000 dollars. He works at a (low paying) pizza chain. My parents helped him a LOT, outright paying a majority of the fees for him. I said that he had just spent 4000 dollars for my brother to doDCI at this he went quiet and didnt say anything for the rest of the ride home. When we got home later that night, he texted me saying we should just get a pizza. I felt like a huge jerk and entitled as hell. I love my parents and my brother, but its frustrating because I work hard in school to do well and it feels like even though jake was a worse student, or a worse kid, or whatever else, he would still get more. I know thats a bad way to look at your siblings and jealously is ugly, but its how I feel.

I don't know if i was an asshole to my dad about the whole thing by just bringing it up, especially because favoritism has been VERY strong in my family in the past (my dads grandmother was insane) so both my dads parents and my parents vehemently deny any favorites. 

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-21,"AITA for confronting my dad about his treatment of me VS my brother? First, I don't want this post to be reposted anywhere on social media, for whatever that counts to somebody.

this is kind of a long story and I've never posted here before. I'm sorry if it breaks rules or if this isnt the place to post it. it also requires a lot of backstory

First, I want to say I am F15 and my brother is M19 (we'll call him jake) I will be sixteen in about two weeks. I really love my brother and we get along well. My parents love us very much and always say they have no favorite child, which i think is true

Since I started high school I have noticed how my parents tend to 'favor' my brother. They do things like pay more attention to him, buy him food/drinks because he refused to eat cafeteria food (hes extremely picky) but wont do the same for me. When he graduated high school last year, they ended up not putting any attention into my 10th grade school year, putting off any shopping until the VERY last minute, lots of stuff.

I also need to state this is where I may be the asshole. My brother is a type one diabetic. he was diagnosed in 2019, I was 12. He was 15 or 16. it's been about 5/4 years since then I've felt this way sometimes.

112,1dkz495,AITA for asking my friend for Amy money back for an emergency ,"AITA for asking for a small amount of money back from my friend.

hey guys, last week I (f20)  asked my close friend f(18)  for £20 back because I was beyond broke and when I gave it to her I was holding money for my sister and didn't realise I took it out of the wrong pot on my bank account. I and I talk nearly every day and are always at each other houses so I thought nothing of it. She always asks me for money and pays and sends it back every time she says she will, I've let a few times slide because to me it's not relevant and I find it so uncomfortable asking for money back. I sent the message on Monday evening and double-texted around the end of Monday and she still did not reply. My friend is always on her phone even when she's working so I did think this was weird but she has aired her other friend's messages in front of me so I didn't question it. She messaged me on Wednesday to say that her mum had taken her phone which I know was a lie as I have her location it said she was at work. I messaged about something unrelated as I didn't want to seem like I was begging for the £20 back but I was meant to send my sister's money to her and kept delaying it. On Wednesday I messaged her again asking if she was good and she said to wait.  She said she was so sorry and that she would send it right then but then proceeded to air me again. Today I sent a question mark which I regret because I feel like an absolute beg I asked my brother for £20 and he sent it so I was able to send the money to my sister but now it's not about the money it's about the principle. I would consider us close we talked at least once a day on the phone and I slept over at her house on Sunday. I feel like I should have seen this coming because she has done this to her other friends so I dont know why I was special. Im not even mad any more i feel hurt I dont know why but asking for money or even for anything makes me feel quite vulnerable and she knows that but is still doing this. I would love to just leave it at that but our families are very interconnected practically cousins and all of our siblings and parents are friends and I dont want to have to deal with that awkward tension. So am I the AITA for asking for the money back in the first place and should I just brush this situation off.

But I am still pretty close with my roommate/friend (Annie) and we hang out pretty often. After I moved out Annie got a new roommate and I am currently renting a room in my landlords apartment. My landlord is ok but is very strict about cleanliness and what I cook. If you know anything about living in Singapore with a landlord you will know what I mean. So I am not allowed to do much cooking except instant noodles. This is not an issue normally as I eat at work anyway.

I do not go over to their place just to cook. I cook when Annie and I decide to cook and eat together, Annie tells me to cook extra to take home. This happened three times in the last 7 months. The last time this happened her new roommate got angry with me when she saw me packing the food and told me this is not my parents house and I should stop doing this etc etc. 

Annie tried to defend me saying that I was her guest and I am free to take the food we cooked together. and also the before the new roommate moved in was that they will be allowed to have guests who can stay over.

114,1dkymfp,AITA for insisting I get the better bedroom?,"Myself and 2 housemates (let's call them Susan and debby)  move into another property next week. 
We have lived in a larger house this year and of five tennants, myself and Susan were the only people to look for houses, book viewings and go to them. Because of this, everyone agreed it would be fair for myself and Susan to have first pick of bedrooms. This was not an issue and debby actually initiated that conversation with the group. 

Fast forward to now. We have a 3 bed property to move into and when we approached the conversation of bedrooms last night it all went downhill. During the hunting process, Susan and I were the only ones to actually book any viewings and also the only ones to go. 

Because of this, we agreed on what room we wanted (same as the year before) and all was fine. 

Debby seems to think she deserves to have a say in rooms because even though she didn't book or come to a viewing, she tried to look for houses and sent a few screenshots into the group chat. I just cannot understand how she thinks she's done as much as us when she made no effort to be there for viewings etc. 

For context, Debby is a great friend but not such a great housemate. She doesn't clean ever or help out around the house and never acknowledges or appreciates when anyone does clean communal areas. 

When the 3 of us tried to discuss last night, Debby got upset, started crying and stormed off. She then ignored us for 7 hours and when we tried to speak again she got angry and stormed off. 

Part of me thinks we should just try to keep the peace and pull straws but I don't think that's fair given debbys input to finding the next house and maintenance on this one. 

Is this something I can stand my ground on or am I the asshole?

We have a private tutoring class on Thursdays from 8 to 9:30 pm and it has become an unsaid pact that we were gonna be going home together every Thursdays. While it takes barely 10 minutes for me to get home, it takes him around 30 minutes and a little longer if he accompanies me home. But he would do it out of his own volition and neither of us had a problem with it. Let's call this friend Pablo. I have another friend, lets call her Sam (18F) who also has class with us on Thursdays (me and Sam have physics, chem and bio together while me and Pablo have only bio together) Now on Thursdays, me and Sam walk a little distance until she needs to take the left turn to her house and then me and Pablo ride our cycles home after. Last Thursday, me and Sam were taking a little longer to chat cuz I had a lot to say. For context, I've been having a lot troubles as of late and my psychologist, after a session with me said that I might had stage 2 depression, PTSD and a personality disorder which he will confirm after a few more sessions with me. So I've been in a really really bad condition for the last 4-5 months. That day particularly, I was in a really foul mood but trying my best to seem ok. But my emotions seeped through. While we were taking our cycles from the garage, he asked what was wrong with me. Now me being a person who finds it physically difficult to speak about my problems I said, ""What else can be wrong... I'll tell you in a bit"" and I said it quite slow.

I went up to a certain area where he would usually wait but i couldn't see him. apparently he saw me but didn't think to call me.

116,1dkyc7n,"AITA for ""frobidding"" my husband from an exotic holiday with colleagues","Me and my soon to be husband agreed that we won´t go on honeymoon right after the wedding. There are numerous reasons, most importantly I´m still studying, will be changing jobs, so I won´t be able to get longer vacation, and we have to save some money because the wedding is not cheap (we are not poor per se, but need to make a financial pillow before another bigger expense such as holiday). 

Another interesting point is that since the beggining of our relationship, my fiancé have been saying that he hates vacations in sunny countries and by the sea, because it´s boring and he doesn´t like high temperatures.

However, he is now planning to go on a vacation with his two colleagues to a very expensive, exotic (Africa) place. I explained to him why I think it´s unfair - he will be enjoying himself, whereas I will have to plan another lowcost road trip around our small country (which we already did three times as students so there´s not much left for us to be seen). Instead of having a calm and more elaborate conversation on this topic, he and his fellow ""vacationers"" invited me to a bar. There, I had to listen to rounds and rounds of reasons, why I should let him go with them (so apparently I forbade him from going). I didn´t feel comfortable sharing our financial situation, so I said that the biggest problem is the timing. They proceeded to plan all the other days we can go to vacation together.

Few concluding notes: I finally agreed with him going, if I get the same amount money he spent there for my personal holiday with friends or my family - this idea was quickly rejected. He would go there with two single female colleagues - now, I am not extremely jealous, but he gets upset even when I get in a car with a male colleague of mine (who lives in a village next to ours so it´s quite convenient). They are also planning a huge roadtrip around the U.S. in the future. This scares me even more, because we want to have kids quite soon (hopefully).

Despite all this, I feel terrible now. He is right in saying that this is once in a lifetime opportunity and the country they are going to looks really beautiful. He is extremely upset and I feel guilty from that evening on.

117,1dky9mj,AITA for refusing to buy a house for the family,"I (21m), and my parents (47f; 72m) are having these huge arguments for the last couples of months. Since I am about to graduate, they have been exploring the idea of buying a house in our city and asking me to pay the mortgage. 

Background:
We are currently living in a rental flat and due to new legislation being introduced, my family has a high chance to be evicted for having too many assets. Meanwhile, my parents already brought a house in my mom’s hometown and furnishings would be done by this fall. They will move to the new house after my first month of employment. However, they have been having the idea of traveling back and forth. Living in new house for couple months and move back to our city for couple months.

Since we gonna probably get evicted and my job kinda pays well, they have been pursuing me to buy a house in our city and they are willing to pay the down payment.

I have been rejecting their ideas for months because:
- I am unwilling to being tied with a house and I don’t want to pay 10 years of mortgage 
- Growing up, we never have that much of a space to live in and I literally don’t have a room. I want to move out and my own personal space
- My parents are not best people you want to live with and we often have disagreements and arguments (my mum once threw my cat out of the door because of anger). I am not quite open with the idea that continue living with them
- Immigration have been circulating my mind for the past few years and I don’t see myself to continue living in my country for another 10 years
- It is not logical that they already brought a house with furnishings done while trying to to buy another house just to live for 6 months

And things finally blew off last night, I stood my grounds and firmly rejected their ideas with my reasoning. They were mad as hell, and they called me out for being selfish and ungrateful. They yelled at me for being a privileged brat and anything I wanted when I grew up I got it. (For that I am grateful, my parents did satisfied me materially when I grew up) Therefore when I refuse to buy a house for the family is totally an act of selfish. But I already agreed to pay them allowance for $13k a month. They kept saying that buying a house shouldn’t bother me since when they die, anything gonna ends up in my pocket and I should see it as an investment. I can see her points but I just don’t care about how much money they gonna left me and I don’t see myself being a home owner 

Meanwhile, their argument is that they eventually gonna retired and lived in our city for better medical services. Buying a new house in mom’s hometown is simply for the bonding between her land and ancestors. They still gonna move back to our state for doctors and things. I replied by saying if that the case I am happy to let them crash in my flat for couples of days or pay their hotel fees. They had a meltdown and strongly refused my suggestions. My mum told me to go suck a dick. Anyway, the fight had a messy endings.

They kept saying that buying a house shouldn’t bother me since when they die, anything gonna ends up in my pocket and I should see it as an investment. I can see her points but I just don’t care about how much money they gonna left me and I don’t see myself being a home owner 

Meanwhile, their argument is that they eventually gonna retired and lived in our city for better medical services. Buying a new house in mom’s hometown is simply for the bonding between her land and ancestors. They still gonna move back to our state for doctors and things. I replied by saying if that the case I am happy to let them crash in my flat for couples of days or pay their hotel fees. They had a meltdown and strongly refused my suggestions. My mum told me to go suck a dick. Anyway, the fight had a messy endings.

So, AITA?

But since she found out that he didn’t want her, he only wanted to be friends with her, she tried to destroy his reputation at work. She made everyone believe he was a stalker. She told everyone that if she wanted him, she could because he was ‘desperately in love with her’. She would spread lies and rumours around work, but nobody had the nerve to ask if any of it was true. She had eventually turned a lot of people against me and him. 

In my opinion she should have just left him alone, he wasn’t doing any harm to her. But the second he started talking to her, she practically threw herself at him. He knew of her ‘sexuality’ (I’m not being mean, but she does claim to be a lesbian and has done for a few years). A bit more context, she is a manipulative person who makes everyone believe what she says.

119,1dkxwww,AITA for not renewing a friend's lease,"So my friend has been renting a studio from me for the last 11 months with two others. There has been drama with the other roommates, she says she ignored red flags with the one guy who she knew, now she pretty much blocks him and says he's made her feel unsafe. I feel like I've tried to be accommodating to her as a landlord and also show up as a friend, but I've felt like it's one sided at times. This is also reasonable to a degree because she's always saying that she has no time due to grad school, working, etc. As a tenant, I've felt that she's always asked for more and more and also made changes like installing a different shower rail, shelves, screwing a shelf to the wall- without checking or letting me know. I feel like she puts blame on others for not doing the things she wants, like she wanted to go on a trip and blames not subletting her space for not being able to afford to go, even though it was all sorted out to let her friend sublet as long as she wasn't there at the same time.

in April I communicated that I wanted to facilitate her staying but she'd need to find housemates by the end of May. She hadn't found anyone else to rent the house with her, so I started to also look for people to rent the whole space including the studio. I could have been more direct then that I was leaning towards not renewing her lease, but I cleared it up today and got a ""F\*\*\*  you"".

 At this point I don't trust her to equitably get along with folks, as she's felt like a bully to me. She was saying that her having to move right now is destabilizing and I don't recognize the position of privilege I'm coming from regarding housing stability.

120,1dkxsel,AITA for “abandoning” my friend,"So I (21F) and my friend, Britney (21F) have been getting into a lot of disagreements lately. Mostly because I’m tired of putting up with her childish behavior and constant lying for self gain. One argument we had was around her buying credit for her phone (credit is basically minutes you can buy to make phone calls). She always asks me to take her somewhere to buy credit, and I told her it would be more convenient to get the app on her phone and pay online that way she can stop using her friends, and it would be cheaper and more convenient. She said she didn’t want to. I told her that’s ridiculous and since that’s her only reason I would no longer be taking her to buy credit. We moved on from it.

Recently she had gone out to hang with some friends and I was at home recovering from an illness. I stepped out the house to pick up something from the smoke shop and asked Britney if she’d like me to pick up her favorite ecig flavor for her since they just restocked. She said sure and invited me to come hangout with her and our other friends. I came, we spent time together and I was driving her home.

She asks me if I could stop to get her food I said sure and we pulled into a Wendy’s parking lot. She calls me from inside of the Wendy’s to bring her hoodie because she bled through her pad. I brought it inside and went back to the car to wait. About 15-20 minutes goes by (fast food in my country isn’t very fast), and she comes back to the car. When she gets in the car she goes “I know you said you’d stop taking me to buy credit but I can’t leave the house tomorrow and I need credit.” 

Now I was a little annoyed by this, and here is where I may be the AH, because I was so annoyed by this it slipped my mind she was on her period and I told her I’d just take her straight home and she could get credit online if she needed it that badly. She said she didn’t want to. So I told her she could just get it tomorrow or the morning after that, since she wouldn’t be able to go out the next day. She also refused and said she would just take an Uber. I asked if she was sure and she said “If you don’t take me to buy credit I’m not speaking to you for a month.”

She does this all the time, throws tantrums or “punishes” her friends when they don’t do what she wants by cutting them off for some random amount of time. So when she said that I was honestly fed up and told her that I’m not taking her to buy credit but I’ll take her home. She calls the Uber anyways and I offer to have her wait in the car as it’s night and I didn’t want her out by herself, she says no and gets out of the car.

When I get home she goes off on me about how I abandoned her to bleed out on her period all over some credit. I explained to her that it slipped my mind and if I had remembered she was on her period I would’ve just taken her. She continues going off on me about what a terrible person I am and how it can’t be THAT annoying.

123,1dkxoyp,AITA for using a screwdriver?,"There are 3 people in this story: K, an assistant manager (55F), my coworker J (21M) and me (22F).

I work in a small town hardware store. J is a student who’s back working for the summer, K and I work all year.

When J and I got to work, J’s tasks for the day included stock counts, building deck boxes, and making new labels for sale products outside. This was expected to take up most of his shift. K also asked J to fix a file holder that kept coming off of the wall at her desk behind the front counter. My job was to stand at the counter and do cashier things. Anything else I did had to be within eyesight of the front.

It’s fun to have J back, but I got used to wearing different hats in the months he wasn’t around, so to just be behind the counter has made the days feel a lot longer. This is not an effort/experience thing either, J and I get similar results when we are given the same workload and my manager has no complaints.

During the day, customers were few and far between. So, while K was on lunch, I grabbed a screwdriver and fixed the file holder with a washer. The head of the screw was too small and so the file holder kept slipping over it with any amount of movement. The “repair”  took me about a minute. At that point in the day, J had been busy elsewhere on the property and hadn’t been in the store. I thought doing this would fix the problem for K and take a small thing off of J’s list to help out while my own list felt pretty light.
When K came back, J was up at the counter getting ready for his lunch. K was grateful, thanking J for fixing the issue as it had been bugging her for so long. I said nothing as I was with a customer and once again, it took so little time to fix. Not exactly a huge achievement or something I wanted recognition for. J casually said that he wasn’t at cash and went to lunch.
Once he left, K asked me if I had touched her file holder, and I just said “Yeah! I hope it works.” 

This is where the conflict begins. K took me aside later in the day and told me that I “basically emasculated” J by doing a repair she asked him to take on. She told me how I “might not get it”, but boys want to feel useful and that I should’ve “let him be a hero”. She felt that I had gone over his head and if it were any other man, they would’ve felt humiliated having to admit that they didn’t actually fix the problem. I think this is nuts, and my response boiled down to “I had no idea it could be taken this way, I’ll check in with J. Thanks for bringing it up.”

J is super chill, and we had a laugh about it when we were closing. But I regularly fight with social anxiety and this is weighing on me.

Since this happened, K keeps treating me weirdly and looks annoyed if I offer to help a customer load something heavy or if I replace the water jug in the breakroom.

124,1dkxntm,AITA for being mad about misuse of disabled parking spaces?,"Hi everyone. Long time proctologist, first time asshole.

I (38F) am I mother of one (M9). He and I and his other mother (42F) all have invisible physical disabilities. The disabled parking permit in my car is registered to me - the only one who can drive - but either of the others is eligible for one and could get it if there was a need to.

It is a constant ongoing source of annoyance and anger to me that other parents park in the disabled parking spaces outside the school when they do not have a valid permit. Aside from the obvious moral issues, this is also illegal. You can be fined a significant amount if caught doing this. 

I have complained often and at length to teachers, and the school's administration (I think they fear me approaching at this point) but they say (correctly) that all they can do is educate. They put out notices, they put up signs. I understand where they are coming from when they tell me they aren't in a position to enforce the law - they're not cops.

It's very often the same few people who do it, and I've often thought about saying something myself, but never have, until today.

My partner happened to be with me (which is not usual) when I picked up my son today, and there was no disabled space available, because a woman was parked diagonally across TWO spaces - one of them disabled only. She was not one of the usual suspects, and she was still sitting in her car, so once I had my son, I told him to go to the car and wait with mummy. Then I approached this woman and had the following verbatim conversation.

""Excuse me, ma'am. Do you have a disabled permit?""

""Do you?""

""Yes, I do.""

""Well. No I don't, but I have 3 children, and I don't want them to walk too far along the road.""

She then rolled the window back up.

I was at this point absolutely furious. I went to my car, and grabbed my phone, went back and took a photo of this lady's numberplate. Not necessarily with the actual intent to report her. Just so I can if I want to, or maybe the realisation that it's a thing I CAN do would remind her it's against the law.

In the other disabled space, also parked illegally, was a woman who does it all the time. She called out for me to ""F*** off, b***h!"" and ""stop harassing her"". I didn't feel I was ""harassing"" her. I spoke to her one time, and then took one photo of her numberplate, which took like ninety seconds all up. My partner says I didn't do anything wrong.

But I am second guessing myself, because there were stacks of parents there and no one weighed in on my side, but someone did on the side of the woman blatantly breaking the law? It's not one of the big ticket laws or anything - she's hardly a murderer, but it's a law that's got an obvious reason. I thought surely most people can agree you don't park in spaces meant only for disabled people.

But I am second guessing myself, because there were stacks of parents there and no one weighed in on my side, but someone did on the side of the woman blatantly breaking the law? It's not one of the big ticket laws or anything - she's hardly a murderer, but it's a law that's got an obvious reason. I thought surely most people can agree you don't park in spaces meant only for disabled people.

 For many years, me and my parents would go to a familys house to stay over for the weekend on our vacation trip visiting other family members an stop for stop for stop type of vacation and on there stop my parents would allsways bring along a cooler loaded with meat as a way to say thank you for us staying under your roof for the few days making them use too getting free meat to enjoy.

 2020 comes and i sadly lost my parents to the pandemic at the age of 30. i go on with my life and do my own trip down to there house and enjoy the my vacation leave.

 i have told them on many ocations they dont have to go out of there way to make my stay special, ill go out and do my own thing unless they plan something for me.

 In 2024 my life long dream came true, with the money i inhareted i took my dream vacation and visited all 6 US Disney parks. i stayed at there house for the night or two before my flight to the US and on my return slept there for one night and left again.

 Before i whent over i told my nephew i will bring him somthing back from over seas. As im in orlando i sent him a Message and asged what his shirt size was knowing the time zone difrences i waited he opend the message and never replied.

About a month later i stayed with them again i was atending Comic Con. And right off the bat that fryday i coudl pick up somthing not right with the father.

 1. when i arrived i sat down on one of ther couches talked with the nephew and when the fathet came house he snaped his finger and poited the older couch of the 3 and said he made a spot for me to sit 2. the saterday we were enjoying coffee - came down stairs and sat on the couch i was made to sit on with my nephew next to me, fater snaps hsi fingers again and the nephew jumps up and sits next to hsi father 3. the sunday they deside to cook meat over the fire, we enjoy some drinks and i go to thre fridge to get some cola, i open a botel pour me a glass and go back, after a while i go gert me another glass open the fridge the bottle of soda is gone and hidden away.

 Feeling miss treated i ask the mother if the father was ok, she starts giving me a speach in the most calm voice and says every time i come over i see it as a free vacation, they are hard working people and i when on my expensive vacation and did bring them any thing (they never opend the message so i could ask) and i bough souvenirs for everyone but them.

128,1dkwrcc,AITA for telling my mom her boyfriend is ugly,"About a year ago my mom (F 43) got a divorce from my step dad. In the time since that split, she has finally gotten the chance to have fun to her heart's content. I love my mom, she is my best friend, my number one confidant, and just an amazing person all together. But I will say that in this last year, her man obsession has gotten a little old to me. 

It’s not that she just wants a fun time, she actively is looking for a relationship. I can’t count how many men she has been through at this point. And it’s always after she waxes on and on about them to me after the first few days. All of this is to say, I have become somewhat immune to her telling me “this one’s different”. 

Recently (1 week ago) my mom met a guy who she truly has been thinking is different from the rest. The only problem is, when I met him at a large group dinner, I realized that he is probably the ugliest man I’ve ever seen. 

My mother is gorgeous. In my mind I’m thinking “He’s short, a smoker, has young kids, his head is a little too small for his body, it looks like he doesn’t have any teeth, and he’s just overall not pleasant to look at. Why should she settle for that?” 

I understand that he has been the most understanding and accepting of her and aligns well with all her values. But they also met 1 week ago and they are already officially exclusive. To me this is just another one of many. Unfortunately, I seem to have gotten worse at holding my tongue with every new guy she mentions. 

After dinner, when my mom met me back home, she asked me very excitedly “What do you think?” And without hesitation I told her “I think he’s ugly.”

Maybe if I had gotten the chance to actually interact with him I could have had more positive traits to add to that about his personality. But we were in a large group for dinner with a lot of people who had never met before, and at those types of events I am the designated “make sure the convo never gets awkward” person. So I was a little too busy to actually try and engage in a serious convo with him the whole time. 

When my mom got upset about my comment she said it was just very superficial. She said I could have said something about how he looked at her or how he interacted with her. But to be completely honest, I hardly noticed it and didn’t really care to put in a lot of effort to know someone who might be getting replaced in a weeks’ time. 

Now my mom is going to bed still upset with me. She said that she’s never going to ask for my opinion again because I only seem to see the physical.

130,1dkwi1t,AITA the asshole for getting my daughter’s dog fixed?,"

Hi, my daughter and I have been living together ever since I had her. She’s currently 23 years old and works full time, while I work remotely. When she was a kid she always wanted a dog but I never bought her one because I think children don’t understand the full responsibility of owning a dog or any kind of pet and I did not feel like taking care of one. I had a change of heart when she turned 19 years old and worked a part time job and could afford a potential vet bill. I surprised her with a little female mutt puppy for her birthday and she has been in love with her dog ever since.

It made me happy to see my daughter happy with her dog she’s been asking for since she was a child, but there is just one issue. When the puppy matured she started going into heat (aka bleeding everywhere). I didn’t think this was going to be a problem since I assumed my daughter was going to get her fixed. (There was no intention to breed her either) When I brought up the question about getting her dog fixed she quickly shot me down and said she’s not going to get her fixed. I asked her why, and she told me that she doesn’t want to put her dog through that pain, and that she doesn’t trust the veterinarians where we live. I told her I understood.

Fast forward 4 years and the dog bleeds everywhere every time she goes into heat. For those of you who has never owned a female dog, they bleed for 2-3 weeks. It’s really annoying and it is starting to become disgusting when her dog goes into heat. My daughter doesn’t clean up after her dogs blood and doesn’t offer to put a diaper on her either. They make diapers for dogs especially for this situation. Her dog bleeds all over the floor, on the carpet, on the couch, and since the dog goes everywhere I have even found blood stains on my bed and on my pillows. I am irritated by the neglectfulness of my daughter for not cleaning the blood, or putting a diaper on her dog but still refuses to get her fixed. I had explained my frustration about this issue and she still refused to get her dog fixed.

Since I work remotely, I took her dog to the vet and got her fixed while my daughter was at work. She came home and noticed her dog was acting a bit off and saw the incision mark. I told her I got her dog fixed since she didn’t listen to my concerns. The dog is ok and is perfectly healthy till this day and recovered quickly. She yelled and cursed at me for doing it behind her back, she claims she is looking for a new place to live, she hasn’t talked to me in months since it happened. Am I in the wrong for this? 


UPDATE- my daughter took very good care of her dog, except wanting to get her fixed. Since I was co owner of the dog under the vets I’m able to take her in. I have taken the dog to the vets a few times for checkups and vaccines. None of which my daughter paid for or was present. When the dog was old enough to get fixed, I brought it up to her multiple times to get her dog fixed. As she said before she doesn’t trust the vets and always said no. This incident happened 4 months ago, and still won’t talk to me. I guess she had found a place to live with a roommate and said she’s leaving in a couple of weeks. It breaks my heart because she is my only child. But I recently learned that my daughter told the family what happened and now everyone is telling me I’m the bad person for going behind my daughter’s back and giving her trust issues.

131,1dkwhe7,AITA for not inviting my Fiancé's ex-Aunt/partner to our wedding? ,"My fiance & I are having trouble after sending out formal invitations to our wedding. I created the guest list for my family & he created the guest list for his family. 

My mother in-law ended up talking to us because her brother, my fiance's uncle, reached out saying that his ex wife's feelings were hurt that she hadn't received a save the date herself even though their four daughters, my fiance's cousins, had received a save the date. 

Some details about the uncle and ex-aunt. They divorced about 30 years ago, my finace was about 10. Their daughters are all now in their 50's & have kids of their own that are almost all adults. My fiance isn't close to his ex-aunt & I've met her 3 times over the last 10 years. As my aunt pointed out when I asked her advice, the ex-aunt never sends a Christmas/birthday card to my fiance. My mother in-law and the ex-aunt aren't close. Although the ex-aunt did come to my father in-law's memorial two years ago. So this isn’t a situation with young kids where the uncle & ex-aunt recently separated. They are just close as a family unit, including the uncle & his ex-wife.

My mother in law ended up insisting that she must be invited despite the fact that my fiance and I said no. We didn't want a huge wedding and its turned into a much larger wedding than we expected. I thought 120 would be a nice size, it's now turned into a 150 person wedding. 

After sending out formal invitations, I included rspv cards to people to indicate who was invited. I read this is a polite way to let people know if they have plus ones/if their children are invited. We haven't invited all of our friends' children & we haven't given all guests a plus one.

The ex-aunt mailed her rsvp card back & added her partner's name to the card. I'm sure she did this because our wedding website will only allow you to rsvp with who has been included. No note was included & she didn't ask if this was okay. We didn't even remember she had a partner, we had forgotten we met him once 3 years ago. On facebook, they've been together for almost 3 years.

She is coming off as rude and entitled. Along with my fiance and I being circumvented. Our philosophy for inviting people was close friends/family, with some extended family. I feel that she's not really going because she wants to be supportive of my fiance and I. If she was, then she should be fine going without a +1. It seems like it's more of a social event for her & she feels entitled to go since her daughters, their husbands and ex husband & his partner are going. 

Other things to note, my own dad isn't even invited because we aren't close. So I'm not sure why an ex-aunt who is not close to my fiance should even be invited. Then after being invited, expect a plus one without asking. 

So, are we the a-holes for not inviting my fiance's ex-aunt? Should she be entitled to a plus one?

My fiance & I are having trouble after sending out formal invitations to our wedding. I created the guest list for my family & he created the guest list for his family. 

My mother in-law ended up talking to us because her brother, my fiance's uncle, reached out saying that his ex wife's feelings were hurt that she hadn't received a save the date herself even though their four daughters, my fiance's cousins, had received a save the date. 

Some details about the uncle and ex-aunt. They divorced about 30 years ago, my finace was about 10. Their daughters are all now in their 50's & have kids of their own that are almost all adults. My fiance isn't close to his ex-aunt & I've met her 3 times over the last 10 years. As my aunt pointed out when I asked her advice, the ex-aunt never sends a Christmas/birthday card to my fiance. My mother in-law and the ex-aunt aren't close. Although the ex-aunt did come to my father in-law's memorial two years ago. So this isn’t a situation with young kids where the uncle & ex-aunt recently separated. They are just close as a family unit, including the uncle & his ex-wife.

My mother in law ended up insisting that she must be invited despite the fact that my fiance and I said no. We didn't want a huge wedding and its turned into a much larger wedding than we expected. I thought 120 would be a nice size, it's now turned into a 150 person wedding. 

After sending out formal invitations, I included rspv cards to people to indicate who was invited. I read this is a polite way to let people know if they have plus ones/if their children are invited. We haven't invited all of our friends' children & we haven't given all guests a plus one.

The ex-aunt mailed her rsvp card back & added her partner's name to the card. I'm sure she did this because our wedding website will only allow you to rsvp with who has been included. No note was included & she didn't ask if this was okay. We didn't even remember she had a partner, we had forgotten we met him once 3 years ago. On facebook, they've been together for almost 3 years.

She is coming off as rude and entitled. Along with my fiance and I being circumvented. Our philosophy for inviting people was close friends/family, with some extended family. I feel that she's not really going because she wants to be supportive of my fiance and I. If she was, then she should be fine going without a +1. It seems like it's more of a social event for her & she feels entitled to go since her daughters, their husbands and ex husband & his partner are going. 

Other things to note, my own dad isn't even invited because we aren't close. So I'm not sure why an ex-aunt who is not close to my fiance should even be invited. Then after being invited, expect a plus one without asking. 

So, are we the a-holes for not inviting my fiance's ex-aunt? Should she be entitled to a plus one? AITA if we let her know that her partner isn't invited?",,0.0459591075778007,0,0

I’m a female living with my boyfriend and two other male roommates. My one roommate (Corey) started dating a girl (Loraine) who is nice but I don’t know her all that well as they sort of just keep to themselves. Our third roommate (Eric) is one of my boyfriend and I’s good friends and we talk often. Eric and Corey both share a bathroom while my boyfriend and I share the master area of the house. One day Eric came up to me and told me that every so often there would be used tampons and pads in their bathroom trash just sitting there and not covered up or wrapped in toilet paper. Eric is not a man who cares about periods or is grossed out by them, however, he’s uncomfortable seeing somebodies used products just hanging out in the open. The trash can also does not have a lid and he has told me that, in the past, Loraine barely threw a used pad in the trash and it was almost on the floor. Cody grabbed a large paper towel and shoved the pad into the trash. 

He came to me and asked if I could possibly talk to her as he felt uncomfortable being a guy and talking to her about her feminine hygiene products. I asked him if he could talk to Corey about it and maybe he’d relay the message but he said he did and the issue has not gotten better since. I said I would talk to her next time I see her but I feel a little awkward about it and I don’t really know how to bring it up. I was always taught to wrap up used feminine products with toilet paper before throwing them away, but I know some people may be taught differently.

Yesterday I called again to try and get an answer and turns out my aunt booked a trip out of the country because she ""forgot"" when I was coming.

They constantly ""critique"" whatever I do, no matter the intent. At the time I'm writing this, I am out of work due to it being the summer.

Any conversation I have is always started with a lecture about how I'm not allowed to sit around and sleep all day. Recently, I ordered a bunch of candles from one of my favorite websites. The reason I always get a ton of candles is because my family likes to use them year round to help any smell caused by our dogs.

 It's driving me crazy, to be honest. I can't say anything to him or I'll get yelled at! He just screams at us for practically no reason. And he's also been so, pardon my language, so fucking condescending about it! He keeps being like ""I feel like it would be better for the family for me to leave, I'm the victim, I'm being hurt here, no one loves me,"" and I'm starting to feel like that's true!

My dad knows  that when we moved last time to my current home in New Mexico, he got so stressed out that he made my mom get fired mostly due to the amount of time he sucked out of my mom with all that yelling. So, he promised to be better. Well, he didn't. He continued to yell at my mom. I mean today he yelled at her for 4 hours straight!

 It's driving me crazy, to be honest. I can't say anything to him or I'll get yelled at! He just screams at us for practically no reason. And he's also been so, pardon my language, so fucking condescending about it! He keeps being like ""I feel like it would be better for the family for me to leave, I'm the victim, I'm being hurt here, no one loves me,"" and I'm starting to feel like that's true! I do want him to leave. I don't feel like I can love him anymore. I still love him so much, and I'm trying to tell myself that I don't hate him... but if he died, I feel like I wouldn't be as sad as I should be. It makes me feel horrible, but I can most definitely imagine a life with a different dad.

Am I the asshole for wanting him o leave? He is my father after all, and he's never beaten me or my mother, but I feel like he's yelled at us so much that when he does I don't feel anything. It's just a normal stroll in the park



P.S. Also, why is he playing the victim? He doesn't have a job (even though he has a PHD), he sits at the house all day playing GTA 5 or his stupid sniper game in the living room! And yard work sometimes. But really, he has no excuse! Whats up with that dad?",0.0,-0.0036918043624609,0,1
141,1dku29z,AITA For buying my dream car,"I recently saw a dream car of mine come up for sale. I had spent the last week expressing to my wife about my desire to purchase this car, even going over several of the opportunities of payment options. I would like the readers to keep in mind that I make over 100k a year and this car was only $5,000. I expressed to her my desire to go look at the car possibly buy the car and explain to her the cost of the car. Her response was that I haven't even test driven it. Today I came home from work explain to her that I wanted to go test drive this car and then I wanted her to come along with me. She said no that she didn't want to be there when I test drove the car that this should be my experience. Well I test drove the car and it was absolutely amazing, so I went ahead and paid the man $5,000 for the car. When I got home my wife was extremely pissed, she was upset that I didn't call to talk to her about paying for the car before I did. She admits that we have been talking about the car and that I was going to go test drive it to see if I wanted to buy the car, she even admits that if I called her to tell her I was wanting to buy the car that she would have no trouble with it whatsoever. Her being upset is hinged around the fact that I did not call her before the funds were transferred, not that she disapproved of the purchase but simply that I didn't call her before I made it. That I don't care about her opinion at all and that this was extremely disrespectful to leave her out of before I pulled $5,000 from savings. Explaining to me that we had not yet agreed upon a way to use funds to pay for the car, weather out of checking, savings, or just pulling a $5,000 loan from 401k ( very unnecessary but it's an option). That I just went ahead and did it without asking her. The way that I was thinking of the situation was that I specifically asked her to come with me to go test drive the car. She said she didn't want to go and wanted to leave this decision up to me, well I made a decision.

142,1dktxg2,AITA My MIL won't stop cooking for my kids ,"I know how the title sounds, but this is really just one thing on a long list of boundaries she seems unable to stop crossing. For background, hubby (33M) and I (38F) and our 4 kids (14M, 12M, 10F, and 9 months F) live with MIL. Several other family members live here as well. To state from the jump, we are not freeloaders. The current arrangement is we pay half the mortgage and all of the household bills. MIL pays the rest out of the rent paid by other household members. We don't live here because we are broke or need someone to take care of us. We have simply had a lot of roadblocks to owning our own home stemming from his prior divorce and his ex wife wrecking his almost perfect (at the time) credit. Also notable is that we have spent several thousands of dollars of savings meant for our own home on maintenance and repairs on MIL's house. We also (obviously) provide all food, clothing, toiletries, etc that the kids need. 

Now to my complaint. Since the birth of our baby (my first child), I have been a SAHM, as the job I had at the time would not have covered day care. As it's summer break, the kids are home every day as well, and ahead of every shopping trip, I ask them what simple breakfast and lunch options they want me to pick up for the week. I do this to give them options I know they will eat and that they can assemble for themselves. I cook dinner for us all every night, but for breakfasts and lunches they can make their own choices. They are all capable of making sandwiches, using a microwave, and my 14 year old can do simple things like fry eggs on the stove. I feel they need to learn this independence and it lightens my load because the baby takes a lot of attention. 

The problem I am running into is that apropo of nothing, without asking me the kids what our plans are, if they are hungry, if they want what she is making, MIL will just cook something, plate it, and hand it to the kids wherever they happen to be. Rest assured, I know what my kids eat and when, I keep them on a pretty consistent schedule, same as I do with the baby. So what she is doing I feel like it undermines me in as much that it seems like she thinks I don't make sure they eat. She is also taking away their choices of the food they specifically asked for, and also is reinforcing them being lazy (which is also a thing she complains about) by not at least asking them to get up and plate their own. She also gets angry if they don't eat what she gives them. I have talked to hubs about it and he says ""she just wants to feel useful."" I just feel there are so many other ways she could be useful without undermining my parenting choices. I realize this is a cultural thing (his family is Hispanic) but I also feel like that doesn't entitle someone to cross boundaries. I could make 800 posts on other things she and I butt heads on, but this is just the current thing that is really bugging me. AITA

Edit: Just so I don't have to keep explaining this in each comment, I'm not ""new."" Hubby and I have been together 6 years, living together almost as long, and the kids have lived full time with us for 4 years. Shortly after they moved in, their mom went radio silent for about a year and a half, so yeah, I have been involved and raising them even when she wasn't. I do food shops, clothing shops, back to school shops. I schedule and take them to doctors and dentists. I pick them up from school/take care of them when they are sick. I fix boo boos when they happen. Help with homework. Talk to them/talk their teachers when they experience bullying at school.  All the basic stuff a mom does. So when I call them my kids, it's because they are. My MIL doesn't do any of that stuff. She is not raising anyone. She pops in when and where she pleases and tries to take credit for doing some kind of heavy lifting. Often she just makes more problems that I end up having to deal with. I pointed out in one comment that she has no problem giving our older daughter sweets/soda/etc without consulting any parent, but is never the one fighting with her to make sure her teeth are brushed. Not the one holding her down when she has to have dental work and the needles freak her out. My MIL's contributions are surface level, and are being done because it's what makes HER happy, not out of helpfulness or any kind of altruism. When she does more heavy lifting, that's when I feel she gets to call the shots, otherwise leave the parenting to the person who's actually doing it. 

Edit 2:  She typically makes things like pancakes. Eggs and tortilla. Beans and tortilla. Rice. Very occasionally a soup or pasta. She's not hitting it out of the park on veggies or nutrition either.

143,1dktxez,AITA for asking my (23f) mom (54f) to leave the store when she embarrassed me,"To preface my mom and I have a weird relationship. The best I can describe it is the feeling of thinking you’ve been Lorelei and Rory from Gilmore girls and then realizing that your mom and your relationship is most representative of Lorelei and her mom. Since this year I’ve realized that she hasn’t been a healthy figure for me, specifically in the way that she fights. Ever since I was a kid, she’d yell obscenities at me and then give me the silent treatment if I’d done something that upset her (ie break glass or spill water accidentally). As a kid, when she’d give me the silent treatment, I remember feeling like it was the last time she’d ever speak to me and that she hated me. To make her speak to me, I’d draw her pictures and write her notes specifically saying how stupid I am and how she’s right. From that she’d start talking to me again. Most of these fights weren’t ever for  serious reasons to begin with. 

Basically today we had an argument. We were going to a cafe and asked for a breakfast sandwich. I asked for there to be no meat on it with just egg. All of a sudden my mom says “no no you want an egg on the sandwich!” I look at her and say yes I said that. She looks back and says I didn’t. Now, with the fight all over and her shattering my confidence once again I don’t even trust my memory enough to say that I did or didn’t say that I wanted an egg in my sandwich. My question is does it really matter? After we’re done ordering she asks the lady at the counter if I actually forgot to say I wanted an egg and the poor lady didn’t want to upset neither of us and she kind of just said that she didn’t remember. I felt embarrassed at the fact that we were that mother and daughter in public. You know, the one that fight and bicker. I felt embarrassed that it mattered to her so much to be right. Just another way of her wanting power. It got to me and I asked her to leave. The second I said it I regretted it bc like always it leads to her not talking to me or looking at me for days/weeks/months on end.

Like a kid, I went and bought her coffee to bring to her so she’d for give me. For what? Well, she says that I need to admit I was wrong because I never admit I’m wrong. Really rich coming from her. So like always, I keep the peace- I beg for her forgiveness and say I was wrong.

I know I’m being gaslit. But I need to be sure because I feel like my life is the twilight zone. So AITA for telling her to leave the store for a stupid argument she started?

144,1dkttf0,AITA? I was in the passenger seat when my friend got into a car crash. Now she and my other friend (Owner of car) want me to pay $400,"Let me start off by saying i(16f) am a minimum wage worker at Starbucks. So are my two friends in this story who i’ll call Bee(16f) and Tana(17f). Bee has her license and her own car, Tana has her learners but doesn’t have a car. I have neither since my mom lost my citizenship and i barely have any ID. Anyway, we all work at starbucks. Tana was hired by reference from me and Bee. Bee lets Tana drive her car around ever since she took it for a spin without Bees knowledge and filled up her tank. long story short, about 2-ish weeks ago me and Tana were waiting for Bee to get off her shift so we could go to the beach. While we were waiting me and Tana went to go fill up Bees tank at the gas station Tana used to work at. Jokingly Tanas old co worker suggested she bring them all drinks from starbucks which we did. Me and Tana had also made 2 drinks for ourselves. While parked at the gas station we placed our drinks on the dashboard since the cupholders were occupied by Bees 2 water bottles. When we were leaving we had somehow forgotten that the drinks were up there, and during a turn the drinks had spilled all over the car. Tana panicked and hit a parked volkswagen. The lady we hit was understandably very mad. The payment for the car ended up being $1300 which Tana and Bee agreed to split since Tana was driving and Bee let her drive. Now today, they had suggested i split it with them since my drink also spilled. I argued that the drink Tana had would have spilled regardless if i was there or not and my drink didn’t make much difference. They said it was the “principle” of it and that i should do it because i’m their friend. I don’t feel $400 is fair for the amount i contributed. I would’ve felt 100-200 reasonable but 400 doesn’t seem reasonable.. i blocked them both after this argument because i’ve just had a rough day and can’t deal with this. But what should i do? am i the asshole for not wanting to pay 400?

EDIT: Yes, i did help clean the interior of the spilled drinks. luckily most of it got on parts that were easy to clean rather than the seats so it just took a few alcohol wipes. Yes, we should have been driving with a DL. We went to an insurance company and turned ourselves in (we filed a claim lol). And yes bee was fully aware we were taking the car to fill up her tank and give Tanas old co workers drinks. And there was no injuries from both parties of the crash 

UPDATE: I’d like to thank everyone for the advice!! i’ve only had the post up for a few hours but i’ve gotten tons of feedback. For people asking what the payment is for, here’s the thing. I’m not very knowledgeable on cars and stuff like this so i’m not sure of the exact terms. I know that originally when we went to the insurance company they quoted us $700 for the deductible. Some people said that’s unusually high but the damages were pretty bad on Bees car and it should actually be considered totalled right now. She texted our groupchat a few days later and i don’t exactly remember why but the price went up from 700 to 1300. I will update the post once i figure out why. Also i know it was immature to block them. I’ve known Bee since grade 5 and Tana i met in freshmen year of highschool. We’re all very close, i just had a real rough day and couldn’t deal with them then and there. A lot of you said NTA, but i will still hold myself partially accountable for my drink since it was also up on the dash board. My average paycheck is around 600 and i still have to save for a car which is why i wasn’t very open to paying 400 since half of my check goes in my savings but we will come up with something more reasonable i’m sure. 

UPDATE 2: It’s been a day since me and Bee talked. Bees auntie reached out to me today and told me that she informed her about the situation and her auntie thought it was ridiculous they were trying to make me pay. Her auntie said she thinks Tana should be paying for the whole thing since she’s the one who crashed the car. As for the payments, i asked her auntie and she said that there was a flat fee of $700 for both cars. the car that Tana hit and Bees car. So actually the total comes out to $1400 and insurance is covering the rest. A lot of people are disagreeing with me trying to take responsibility for my part and after speaking with a few adults in my life i’m starting to realize that it does in fact sound ridiculous they’re trying to make me pay. Me and Bee are both unfortunately quite petty so i don’t think that either of us will be reaching out to talk and i might just have to let them both go as friends.

145,1dktpxh,AITA for not forgiving my cousin?,"This story involves me (f15) and my cousins, who I’ll call Red (m14), Red’s sister Purple (f13), and Blue (m11). 

We were all at a park when Blue made a fat joke towards Purple. The joke was “the only thing that revolves around you is body fat”. Purple got offended and we calmly explained three times to Blue why what he said was wrong. He didn’t really understand what we were saying, but he had a really sheltered upbringing with one hour of screen time a day, strict parental controls, and has been homeschooled his whole life by religious parents so he didn’t know why the joke was bad. However, Red did not have the same upbringing. He was raised in the American public school system with no limit on his screen time and no parental controls at all. Red knew what his joke meant and kept telling Purple that it was “just a joke and to not take it so deep”.

Red and Purple started arguing, and the argument escalated to Purple explaining to Red and Blue that she has had a close friend with an eating disorder, mental health issues, and who has almost control+alt+deleted herself. She did this to give them perspective on how jokes like that are bad and can really affect someone‘s mental health. At this point, Blue started to kind of understand that it was bad, but you know what Red said? Womp womp. At this point I got really pissed and we walked back to the house we were at.

Purple told Blue’s mom what happened so that she could help him understand better. I had to tell the rest of the adults (Red and Purple’s mom, their other sister, Blue’s mom, our grandma, my mom, and another aunt). 

After that, Purple talked to her sister and Blue and Red got an earful from Blue’s mom. After everyone calmed down, Blue and Purple had a long discussion where they talked it out a Blue apologized for what he said. During this, however, Red kept trying to interject, saying “you did nothing wrong” “don’t apologize” to Blue and “so you took a joke out of context“ to Purple. It got to the point that even Blue had to tell him “Can you not say anything else until we have this sorted out so you don’t rip it apart again?” Red was finally quiet until they got it sorted out but he kept going on and on about it after it was over. Purple got fed up and said some personal things that I won’t say in this post out of respect of her privacy. After Purple said this Red got quiet and left the room. He has not apologized for anything he said.

The next day, I was talking about how I was pissed at Red for what he said and did, and my aunt told me that I should just forgive him and not hold a grudge. But I’m still very upset with him and how immaturely he handled this. It just shocks me how an 11 year old could have a more adult conversation than him. I’m just looking for a second opinion here.

We were all at a park when Blue made a fat joke towards Purple. The joke was “the only thing that revolves around you is body fat”. Purple got offended and we calmly explained three times to Blue why what he said was wrong. He didn’t really understand what we were saying, but he had a really sheltered upbringing with one hour of screen time a day, strict parental controls, and has been homeschooled his whole life by religious parents so he didn’t know why the joke was bad.

146,1dktmat,AITA for opting out of the office birthday gift fund,"I, 38(f), have been in the same work team for several years.

I recently decided that I would like to opt out of contributing money to birthday gifts at work, this is partly due to finances but more because I had started to notice that some people didn’t get the same birthday experience at work despite being on the same team for a reasonable amount of time (1 year +) and contributing to the gifts of others. By this I mean that we all contributed to gifts, but not everyone got a gift or afternoon tea on their birthday.

I had been on the team a long time, so I didn’t get missed off the birthday list, but others being asked to contribute and then not included seemed unfair to me in a workplace context. It seemed that this situation didn’t bother most others, or at least I never heard anyone else mention it. It really wasn’t sitting well with me though, and I had been finding it expensive to keep up with, so I opted out, but I gave finances as the sole reason as it was valid.

I explained to Katherine \*, our boss and the birthday organizer, that I was happy to contribute financially or otherwise to card’s and afternoon tea’s because I did want to participate, but that the gift giving element was getting a bit expensive for me, so I wanted to opt out of contributing to or receiving gifts. Directly after this Katherine explained to the whole team that the gift for Sarah\* (not in the room) would require an extra few dollars each because I had opted out, which put me on the spot. It was pretty awkward, and seemed like the team were a bit puzzled. 

Because at the time I opted out I didn’t know that Sarah’s gift had already been purchased I offered to contribute to Sarah’s gift and that was met with “oh no, don’t worry about it” from Katherine in a tone which implied something rather different. In short, I could tell that she was annoyed, but I don’t really understand why my decision bothered her so much. I wondered if I may have inadvertently broken a workplace etiquette rule by saying I didn't want to contribute $$ to gifts?

I understand that many people find gift giving important. I enjoy gift giving, I never expect gifts back from friends, a gift is a gift!, but I don't enjoy seeing disparity in the workplace and I don't really want to contribute money unless its fair and everyone receives something, since everyone is contributing and it can feel a bit obligatory to do so. I asked a friend about it, and her take was that it’s about workplace politics, and that other people may also think what I think, but they are contributing because that is what you do in that situation, and that I made it awkward by opting out when most people would just put up with it. She thought that the budget concerns wouldn’t wash because they earn similar to what I earn, and they can manage. She did think that my boss was a bit of a dick though for putting me on the spot like that.

Scenario:

I live in an apartment building with about 15-20 units on each floor and we have a washing room with 2 washers and 2 dryers on each floor. You pretty much share your washing room with everyone on your floor. Some people on my floor have the tendency to put their clothes in the washer/dryer and forget about it or change it whenever they get around to it. 

This is unacceptable and inconsiderate imo. You should be present when your load finishes and ready to transfer your laundry. This is essential in a shared environment. 

I sometimes will wait up to 10 minutes after the load finishes as a grace period but if they don't show up to move their clothes in that time, I take their clothes out and set them on the machine or counter, wherever there's space.

One neighbor insinuated that I should go to other floors and look for an empty machine instead of moving clothes. No... We have our own machines on our floor, I'm not going to go take from another floor because someone on my floor is dragging their feet moving their things out of the way for others. You don't get to hold the machines hostage. 

Today I had to take someone elses finished load out of one washer because they had finished loads in both washing machines just sitting there (same person using 2 machines). When I came to move my clothes to the dryer there was a note on my washer door saying ""please dont touch my clothes."" And another note saying ""this counter is dirty.""

149,1dktb71,AITA? my family harassed my bf and I ,"AITA? My family harrased my bf and I

 My family harassed my partner and I.

Me (21f) and my (27m) bf have been together six months now. 
We both have anxiety and don’t like meeting new people, so I already made it clear to him that he could meet my outer family  (cousins, aunts ect) when he felt comfortable.
 my outer family are quite entitled, they don’t respect boundaries and as I’ve grown up I’ve slowly distanced myself from them as I don’t view them as very supportive. 
Because of this i asked my parents and siblings to keep my relationship private until I was ready to tell the extended family, somehow they found out and which is when it all started. 

It started with a few comments of “when are we going to meet him” to full blown getting the police involved. 
When the outer family found out I told them that due to his anxiety, he would be meeting them on his terms, so to not put pressure on him.

During a small family catchup (which I rarely involve myself in anyway) they shouted me to come down and see them, claiming it was rude of me not to despite my bf being over at the time. 
When they found out he was upstairs one of my aunts attempted to go upstairs and meet him ( he was literally in bed as it was 9am on a Sunday and he’d just woken up)
My cousin (she’s like 10) had to pull my aunt back because even a CHILD knew better. 

A few weeks of my aunts and cousin coming round hoping to catch him here, even making rude and hostile comments when he wasn’t over, as if he owed them his presence. 

when my boyfriend had stayed over the previous night and my sister and I decided to go into town without my boyfriend, to which my cousin followed us in the hopes to “bump into” my bf and I. 
She blatantly admitted that she was only there to basically run into us, knowing he dislikes meeting new people. 

when my cousin came round uninvited, my partner and I were home alone
My cousin then decided she would attempt to break into the house. 
She managed to unlock the conservatory and attempted to get into the back door. 
my mother was out shopping and she didn’t even contact us to see if we were home. 
When I went out to confront her she started laughing, later claiming she didn’t know it would be an issue. 

That is when I spoke to the police.

Since all this, I’ve barely spoken to any of them and they’ve claimed I’m being rude and though I’ve explained why I am disappointed in them, they seem to think that it’s unfair that I’ve “kept my bf from them”

150,1dli0y2,AITA For Telling My Best Friend Not To Drive My Car Like an Asshole ,"I’ll try to stick to short paragraphs or bullet points for the sake of brevity due to a loooooong history. 

Bestie and I have been friends since we were in high school and we’re now 50. Her kids went off to college so she sold her house and moved down to FL with me. 

I work from home so I told her its cool to use my car. I barely use it. It’s been about 7 months and 6k miles later that she decided to buy their own. Of which I feel is a good idea because of the substantial increase in mileage and wear. Due to my mechanical and bodywork background, I would go along shopping to “kick the tires”.  

In this instance, there was a promising vehicle, perfect actually, just needed the price where the salesman said it would be over the phone. Nope. That didn’t happen. It would have been a done deal if he had honored the price he promised. 

This was about car #12 in the 20 day hunt for the right car that included trips 77 miles away in torrential downpours. This attempt was an hour and 20 minute drive. It’s getting exhausting to say the least. 

Incident: I got into the back seat of my car and she and her kid (visiting from out of town) sat up front. My sister lives nearby and had pre-checked the vehicle for us, so a gratuity dinner was offered. As I was on the phone with her, the bestie pulls out and sits in the driveway to exit. I’m still on the phone with my sister, bestie starts hollering, “left or right”, I’m trying to concentrate on my conversation with my sister. Meanwhile, the dealership is dead and no one is behind us.  Bestie still decides to not wait for me to finish the conversation and peels out to the left. The tires squeal and I’m thrust to the side. 

I don’t recall yelling, but I’m told by the bestie, her kid and my sister, via the bestie ( I guess B called sis to ask her POV), that I did. But what I said was, “please don’t drive my car like that!” She yelled something back that I don’t remember and then I told her that if she was too upset or pissed about the deal falling through, to pull over and I would drive.” 

She really flipped her shit then!! Stopped the car in the highway and got out stomping, “you drive! I’m so fuming at you! Don’t talk to me!!” She went and sat in the backseat and sulked. Her poor kid was up front feeling awkward AF. She then yelled at me, “you’re just pissed because we drove all the way up here for nothing!” “Please stop telling me how I feel.” With tears streaming down my face. 

I know that the argument was blown out of proportion. I allowed it to escalate when the ball came into my court. It’s difficult when you’ve known someone for so long and now you’re living together. I don’t deny that I have some responsibility, but when I ask for my shit (in this instance my car) to be treated with respect, why should I be the AH?!? 

My efforts for short and sweet failed and if you made it this far, I really appreciate your time and consideration.
