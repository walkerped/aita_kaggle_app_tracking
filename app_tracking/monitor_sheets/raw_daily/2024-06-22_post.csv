0,1dlp9be,AITA for refusing to interact with my cousin or go to family gatherings where they are present,"Throwaway for privacy. I (16) have been refusing to interact (text, talk, call with, etc.) with my cousin (17) for about 2 years now. This is due to a situation that happened over Christmas break at my grandmothers house, where they had come into my room, closed the door behind them, and (in the middle of a conversation) told me that they had thought about walking into my room and ‚Äúcatching me masturbating‚Äù. For extra context, I am an FtM man who presents feminine(ish) and they had, at the time, identified as male. Ever since this happened I‚Äôve had nightmares about them, broken down at the thought of seeing them for an extended period of time, become afraid of being in locked rooms with other people, and become sexually repressed. 

I‚Äôve barely talked with them since then, and my entire family has noticed this. We were never really close to begin with, but my avoidance of them have been pointed out by both my uncle (their father) and recently, my own father. It‚Äôs even gotten to the point where my uncle has called me a brat, among other things, to my parents. I‚Äôm not close with my parents at all, so they don‚Äôt know what happened (this is one of three times I‚Äôve actually talked about it, with the other two happening while I was inhibited). 

It‚Äôs begun to come to a head recently, though, now that I‚Äôm legally old enough to stay home alone and away from any family gatherings. My father has also begun to guilt trip me a little too, with him telling me that my cousin is trans (I don‚Äôt know whether their MTF or nonbinary, which is why I‚Äôve been using they/them) and not out to their parents, saying that since I‚Äôm also trans I should support them. 

I don‚Äôt want to ever see them again, but I also know how difficult it can be to not have support within your own family. I genuinely just don‚Äôt know what to do, whether I should just move past what happened or keep avoiding them.

1,1dlkwa6,AITA for wanting a courthouse wedding?,"Hey everybody! I'm going to make this post simple and sweet. I just want some advice. So, my fiance and I just got engaged last month during a trip to Oklahoma. It was magical and special, and of course, she said yes! So wooo, everything is happy! Anyway, I won't be using any actual names just out of respect for privacy, but I'll be referring to my future mother-in-law simply as MIL. 

My fiance and I began making wedding plans. We knew from that start that we wanted to get married in her hometown simply because she has more family there, and it'd be easier to fly my family there versus vice versa, so we'd have an easier time getting family together. My fiance and I aren't huge wedding people; it's not the kind of thing where she's been dreaming of some big extravagant wedding or anything like that. We want to celebrate our love for each other while surrounded by close family and friends and invest more of our energy and money in our honeymoon. Anyway, this plan wasn't working so much for my MIL.

To summarize, my MIL has tried to get us to change the date three times, asked us to do a venue and go all in, and has expressed her dismay with us getting married in a courthouse. She was wed in a courthouse and regrets it, so she kind of pushes that regret onto us in a way to guilt us into doing a bigger wedding when all that we want to do is fly there for a week, have the courthouse wedding surrounded only by very close family and friends and then to spend the rest of our trip just being around her family before we zip to our honeymoon so at some point we cave and we're like alright we can at least do a small venue and stuff.

Recently, my MIL came into some fortune, $21,000 to be specific, and she tells my fiance and me about this when it happens; of course, we're happy and ecstatic for her. $21,000 is massively helpful in almost any household, so that's incredible. Of course, we're happy for her. During that same phone call, she promised to pay for two of our friend's flights, my parents' flights, and a condo to stay at during the wedding. The next day, she messages us and tells us how she spent $15,000 on a concert. $9000, which is solely for the concert tickets. I'm a big stranger to concerts, but I know they can get pricy and we really understand that it's her money and she can spend it however she wishes, but we felt a little hurt by it.  Anyways, she has since taken back what she said she was going to help with, and so we told her that on second thought, we kind of want to go back to the original plan and do a simple courthouse ceremony, and well, she got upset with that. She then went on to make some hurtful comments at my fiance for how she moved out at 18 and doesn't see her and stuff, which isn't true. It's not like we haven't tried, and she said at least her sister wouldn't just do some dumb courthouse wedding.

Anyways, we're just very hurt by everything and it has made our special day very stressful and we don't know what to do about it.

3,1dlksl7,AITA for calling my friends assholes and telling Emily she deserves better?,"I got into an argument with my friends. They disagree with me, but I really do believe they are wrong.

One of our friends gained weight because she was depressed and her bf pointed it out and said they should go work out every day. We'll call her Emily. Our other friends are a couple, Eva and Jake.

She was talking to us and told us that he said that. She said she hates living like this and she is going to go to the gym and turn around her life.

I told her that she deserved better, that he should have never said that to her. I said he should NEVER comment on her weight. You should never comment on a women's weight. It could make her insecure and he's an ass for that. If he didn't like it, he could leave.

But our other friend and her bf disagreed. He said that is part of normal communication while being in a relationship. He said, ""if you can't handle your partner communicating with you, you aren't really to be in a relationship.""

His gf, Eva, backed him up, which really annoyed me. She said she would have done the same thing if she were the bf and brought it up to have a discussion about it. She said there was nothing wrong with out and saying ""just leave"" is childish.

I said it's not childish. If he doesn't like it, he can go. But of course Emily was like, ""But I love him. I don't want our relationship to end.""

It really annoyed me and I told her that I was just saying that she deserved better. I've seen so many threads on AITA and they all agree it's a dick move to bring up working out/weight to your gf.

Now Jake was being rude. He said those people have never been in a relationship before, it is normal to talk about in a healthy relationship. 

They started making fun of how redditors always say to ""break up"" and how I sound like that. I felt super ganged up on and told them they were being assholes, but I know I was right.

4,1dlkq0k,"AITAH for being upset that my family had ""my baby shower"" without me. ","Hello Reddit,

This is my first time posting, and I don't really know what is typically done here other than people vote on whether you're the A or not. I'm posting because I'm curious what other people's reactions would be if they were in my situation. It also seems like I'm the odd one out since people think I'm crazy/rude/awful. And have been making their opinions known lately.

This situation happened right at the height of Covid in August of 2020. I don't want to make this a long post, but I do think all the information below is relevant to the story.

¬†1. My husband worked in a hospital with active covid patients.

2. ALL OF MY INLAWS WERE HIGH-RISK FOR CONTRACTING COVID.

3. At the time, pregnancy didn't make you high risk (we were still learning about the disease, now I believe it does? Not sure)

4. If I were to have a baby shower it would be towards the end of my pregnancy because that's when I would feel comfortable that the likelihood of a miscarriage is lower.¬†

Now on to the story...

Covid was pretty rough on all of us. At the time, I had a 3 year old and I was pregnant with really really bad nausea as well as aches and pains that seemed never ending. The nausea didn't even go away with medications.¬†I did my best to stop it, and just continued life as normal as possible, even though we were stuck inside and all of our activities were no longer happening.¬†

My husband, as I mentioned worked in a hospital, he dealt with covid patients. Because of this we were extremely careful. When he came home, he would remove his clothes and shoes in the garage. He would immediately put them in the washing machine. He would bathe in our downstairs bathroom, and then would come up to see us. We would sanitize and wear masks when necessary. Basically we followed protocols that were told to us at the time. My in-laws however had different plans. Which they are entitled to.¬†

They didn't quarantine, they didn't socially distance, they shared masks and had large gatherings at their houses. One of which was a wedding in their backyard. I didn't want to go, but my husband convinced me. We wore masks, social distanced, and didn't go inside the house. I will admit, I was angry because I was told everyone would be wearing masks, except the bride and groom. But no one did. I maintained my distance and told myself, I'm not doing that again. It was very obvious that I was trying to stay safe (my husband included).¬†

It was very hard to keep a 3 year old away from the people he loved. And I sincerely was doing it for their benefit knowing that we were the ones who could contract it (since my husband worked in healthcare) and give it to his family.¬†

One of my sils kept telling me that she would see us in a few weeks. I was confused at first, but didn't think much of it because I was too nauseous, and tired, and dealing with my toddler to try and decipher what that meant.¬†

When it came closer to the date, I had a feeling that she was throwing me a baby shower. However, I am not a baby shower type of girl. I don't mind if other people have them, I just don't like them for myself. I had one for my first kid and I told my mom and sil explicitly that I am ONLY doing this for you all and because it is the first grandchild on both sides. They knew this before my first baby shower, and they definitely knew this while planning this one. My husband has since told me that he told them I wouldn't like it.¬†

Because of this feeling, I texted my sister in law a few days before the date she told me. I asked if she was having a baby shower for me, and she said yes. I told her that I am not going to be able to attend, I have very bad nausea, (as I have been having, especially lately and I'm exhausted) and most importantly, it would be irresponsible of me or her to have something like this, given the circumstances. We were literally a town that had just become ""red"", which meant that numbers were going up pretty severely and they were warning us to remain 6 ft and whatever else advisory. I also told her that it's a really nice and thoughtful gesture, but I wouldn't be able to morally live with myself if we convened and someone got severely sick just because I wanted to party. (Which again, I didnt, and would never, as I am extremely introverted). She said okay and I thought it was done.

I get a call the next day from my friend saying that my sil called her to say I'm not coming to my baby shower and that I (my friend) probably don't want to go since I wouldn't be there. This friend was super super cautious (still is) and was only going to ""my baby shower"" to make me happy. She literally felt like she was risking her life. My sil told her safety precautions were going to be in place and that it would be outside. So she agreed. She called me surprised, because she thought it was a surprise for me. But then my sil called and told her that I knew and that I wasn't coming. So I told my friend yeah, I would never do this and especially during a time like this, especially knowing who my family is.

Unfortunately, literally no one in my family is healthy. High blood pressure, cancer, high cholesterol, heart issues, asthma, severe allergies, fragile bones, arthritis, just to name a few. And this is just off the top of my head with the inlaws and my moms side of the family.¬†

My friend and I hung up and I thought nothing of it. It's done. No harm, no foul, right? Wrong. I literally thought she (SIL) was making her calls to whoever she invited. Til this day, idk who was invited because I literally have 1 friend in this state. I thought it was over and done with either way.

The next day, my older cousin texts me and tells me that since I didn't show up to the baby shower and I didn't want the homemade cupcakes she made, she would take them back home with her.

I responded with... what??? You were invited?? It's happening??? How??? I was shocked. I couldn't believe that they had ""my baby shower"" without me!! I felt terrible because she is another one who literally had not left her house since March. She worked from home, her kid was home from school, her wife also worked from home, she had groceries delivered. The works. Again, another person risking their lives to ""please me"" but it wasn't for me. Especially knowing that they had the whole event without me, didn't cancel anything and didn't follow any supposed protocols. I was immediately angry, immediately hurt, shocked, whatever feeling, I likely had it. Other than happiness.

Til this day, I'm still confused as to how anyone would think it's okay to have a baby shower when the mother isn't present. Thankfully, I'm not angry/sad/hurt anymore. But it's definitely still insane to me.¬†

My husband immediately went into defending his family. My cousin told my mom and aunt that I was wasn't happy about what was going on. They both called and tried to defend themselves. My mom particularly said: ""I wanted to celebrate my grandchild, you can't stop me from doing that"".¬†And she's right, I can't stop her from doing that ( even though I think its crazy) but do it at your own party, with your own friends. Why make me aware of it at all? As though it was for me.

¬†I see this as a major betrayal. My mom and I have had a very tumultuous relationship. She has physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually been abusive. My aunt has defended her. My other aunts and grandmother think she can do no wrong. She's the one who told my sil to still have the party because according to my mom, ""I would show up"". But my sil knew I wouldn't because 1) I told her 2) she told my friend I wasn't going to be there, meaning my sil also knew I wouldn't be there 3) I gave my reasoning about covid being bad at the moment plus my other ailments. None of those stipulations had changed from one day to the other.

My ils were confused as to why I was angry. Like it was no big deal that the person who you are literally having the baby shower for isn't there.¬†I blocked all of my ils. I also blocked my mom and aunt. My cousin didn't know I wouldn't be there until she and her family made the 1.5 hour drive to my sils house. I wrote an email to my sil explaining why, with a long laundry list of things that were pretty similar to this, in the sense that they don't respect me, my boundaries, my generosity and my willingness to always go above and beyond and basically this is the respect I get. I don't need thank-yous. I need you to respect me and consider my feelings. But nope it's just about what they want, and they wanted to party so party without me they did.

My brother, who I still speak to, called me a week after the event to update me on his life. He went to the party, but he didn't know where he was going at first. My mom told him to jump in the car and told him she was going to a party. My brother didn't ask any questions (very typical of him). As they were driving, she told him that it was ""my baby shower"". And he was immediately surprised. He said that this ""wasn't for my sister, because if you knew her, you'd know that she wouldn't want this"". My mom told him that I knew about it. And nothing else. He decided to stay, because he was moving out of the country and this was his last time seeing all these people, at least for a long while. I still haven't seen him. So yeah. A long while.¬†

He said they wanted to take video to supposedly send to me and every time they would pivot to him, he would ""ruin it"" (according to them) by saying ""this isn't for {insert my name}"".¬†Again, this fact only further proves that they were aware, and that they saw nothing wrong with what they were doing.¬†

After I blocked them, I have gotten many passive aggressive things done to me. For example, when my son was born, my husband and kid, and new baby all got ""gifts"" from one sil congratulating them. Not me. Just them. Another sil delivered donuts and coffee for my husband and toddler with a card saying ""for all your hard work"". As though they did anything.¬†During the delivery, they constantly called to see if the baby was born, not to see how I was. So much so, that my husband wasn't ""present"" with me. And I can't help but think it was on purpose.¬†

After the baby was born, our doctor advised that no one see the baby for at least 3 months. We complied. My husband would often FaceTime and I would constantly hear ""oh he has dimples, like me (meaning my sil) when I literally have 2 dimples. Any feature of mine, that was very clearly mine. They would try and attribute it to themselves or some long lost relative of theirs. Very weird, when BOTH my kids look exactly like me. Literally hair color, texture, dimples, face, smile. I've been told that we look like twins by others. But of course it's your uncles kids, kid. Sure.¬†

That's my story.

AITAH? My husband's family has all deemed me so. My family has also deemed me so.

I don't think I am. Especially given context.

Relevent Information before I'm asked:

1. The baby shower was in a home, no venue to cancel or deposit they lost out on. Everything to my knowledge was refundable or theirs already.¬†
2. My ils knew the rules as they were very on top of watching the news 24/7.
3. My Mom and Aunt also work in another hospital and although it's not patient care, they had to be constantly tested and follow the same procedures as the doctors/nurses/medical staff.¬†
4. I did not block anyone/go no contact solely because of this issue. It was merely the straw that broke the camels back. It is like a light switch went off and I just realized the relationships no longer serve me. (If they ever did)
5. I've been in therapy for about 5 years, twice a week to get over my crappy childhood.¬† ¬†
6. I did not get any of the ""gifts"" that were for my baby shower.
7. Not too long before ""my baby shower"" did extended family on my husbands side have something called drive-by baby showers, in which people dropped off gifts in their cars and watched as the mother opened them in their front yard. This could have been an option that they knew about, but didn't even consider, because again, I do not believe the baby shower was for me at all, but more so for them and their interests. (There were also FaceTime baby showers and gender reveals that people did).",TL;DR,2024-06-22,"AITAH for being upset that my family had ""my baby shower"" without me.  Hello Reddit,

It was very hard to keep a 3 year old away from the people he loved. And I sincerely was doing it for their benefit knowing that we were the ones who could contract it (since my husband worked in healthcare) and give it to his family.¬†

One of my sils kept telling me that she would see us in a few weeks. I was confused at first, but didn't think much of it because I was too nauseous, and tired, and dealing with my toddler to try and decipher what that meant.¬†

When it came closer to the date, I had a feeling that she was throwing me a baby shower. However, I am not a baby shower type of girl. I don't mind if other people have them, I just don't like them for myself. I had one for my first kid and I told my mom and sil explicitly that I am ONLY doing this for you all and because it is the first grandchild on both sides. They knew this before my first baby shower, and they definitely knew this while planning this one. My husband has since told me that he told them I wouldn't like it.¬†

Because of this feeling, I texted my sister in law a few days before the date she told me. I asked if she was having a baby shower for me, and she said yes. I told her that I am not going to be able to attend, I have very bad nausea, (as I have been having, especially lately and I'm exhausted) and most importantly, it would be irresponsible of me or her to have something like this, given the circumstances. We were literally a town that had just become ""red"", which meant that numbers were going up pretty severely and they were warning us to remain 6 ft and whatever else advisory. I also told her that it's a really nice and thoughtful gesture, but I wouldn't be able to morally live with myself if we convened and someone got severely sick just because I wanted to party. (Which again, I didnt, and would never, as I am extremely introverted). She said okay and I thought it was done.

I get a call the next day from my friend saying that my sil called her to say I'm not coming to my baby shower and that I (my friend) probably don't want to go since I wouldn't be there. This friend was super super cautious (still is) and was only going to ""my baby shower"" to make me happy. She literally felt like she was risking her life. My sil told her safety precautions were going to be in place and that it would be outside. So she agreed. She called me surprised, because she thought it was a surprise for me. But then my sil called and told her that I knew and that I wasn't coming. So I told my friend yeah, I would never do this and especially during a time like this, especially knowing who my family is.

Unfortunately, literally no one in my family is healthy. High blood pressure, cancer, high cholesterol, heart issues, asthma, severe allergies, fragile bones, arthritis, just to name a few. And this is just off the top of my head with the inlaws and my moms side of the family.¬†

My friend and I hung up and I thought nothing of it. It's done. No harm, no foul, right? Wrong. I literally thought she (SIL) was making her calls to whoever she invited. Til this day, idk who was invited because I literally have 1 friend in this state. I thought it was over and done with either way.

The next day, my older cousin texts me and tells me that since I didn't show up to the baby shower and I didn't want the homemade cupcakes she made, she would take them back home with her.

I responded with... what??? You were invited?? It's happening??? How??? I was shocked. I couldn't believe that they had ""my baby shower"" without me!! I felt terrible because she is another one who literally had not left her house since March. She worked from home, her kid was home from school, her wife also worked from home, she had groceries delivered. The works. Again, another person risking their lives to ""please me"" but it wasn't for me. Especially knowing that they had the whole event without me, didn't cancel anything and didn't follow any supposed protocols. I was immediately angry, immediately hurt, shocked, whatever feeling, I likely had it. Other than happiness.

Til this day, I'm still confused as to how anyone would think it's okay to have a baby shower when the mother isn't present. Thankfully, I'm not angry/sad/hurt anymore. But it's definitely still insane to me.¬†

My husband immediately went into defending his family. My cousin told my mom and aunt that I was wasn't happy about what was going on. They both called and tried to defend themselves. My mom particularly said: ""I wanted to celebrate my grandchild, you can't stop me from doing that"".¬†And she's right, I can't stop her from doing that ( even though I think its crazy) but do it at your own party, with your own friends. Why make me aware of it at all? As though it was for me.

¬†I see this as a major betrayal. My mom and I have had a very tumultuous relationship. She has physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually been abusive. My aunt has defended her. My other aunts and grandmother think she can do no wrong. She's the one who told my sil to still have the party because according to my mom, ""I would show up"". But my sil knew I wouldn't because 1) I told her 2) she told my friend I wasn't going to be there, meaning my sil also knew I wouldn't be there 3) I gave my reasoning about covid being bad at the moment plus my other ailments. None of those stipulations had changed from one day to the other.

My ils were confused as to why I was angry. Like it was no big deal that the person who you are literally having the baby shower for isn't there.¬†I blocked all of my ils. I also blocked my mom and aunt. My cousin didn't know I wouldn't be there until she and her family made the 1.5 hour drive to my sils house. I wrote an email to my sil explaining why, with a long laundry list of things that were pretty similar to this, in the sense that they don't respect me, my boundaries, my generosity and my willingness to always go above and beyond and basically this is the respect I get. I don't need thank-yous. I need you to respect me and consider my feelings. But nope it's just about what they want, and they wanted to party so party without me they did.

My brother, who I still speak to, called me a week after the event to update me on his life. He went to the party, but he didn't know where he was going at first. My mom told him to jump in the car and told him she was going to a party. My brother didn't ask any questions (very typical of him). As they were driving, she told him that it was ""my baby shower"". And he was immediately surprised. He said that this ""wasn't for my sister, because if you knew her, you'd know that she wouldn't want this"". My mom told him that I knew about it. And nothing else. He decided to stay, because he was moving out of the country and this was his last time seeing all these people, at least for a long while. I still haven't seen him. So yeah. A long while.¬†

He said they wanted to take video to supposedly send to me and every time they would pivot to him, he would ""ruin it"" (according to them) by saying ""this isn't for {insert my name}"".¬†Again, this fact only further proves that they were aware, and that they saw nothing wrong with what they were doing.¬†

After I blocked them, I have gotten many passive aggressive things done to me. For example, when my son was born, my husband and kid, and new baby all got ""gifts"" from one sil congratulating them. Not me. Just them. Another sil delivered donuts and coffee for my husband and toddler with a card saying ""for all your hard work"". As though they did anything.¬†During the delivery, they constantly called to see if the baby was born, not to see how I was. So much so, that my husband wasn't ""present"" with me. And I can't help but think it was on purpose.¬†

After the baby was born, our doctor advised that no one see the baby for at least 3 months. We complied. My husband would often FaceTime and I would constantly hear ""oh he has dimples, like me (meaning my sil) when I literally have 2 dimples. Any feature of mine, that was very clearly mine. They would try and attribute it to themselves or some long lost relative of theirs. Very weird, when BOTH my kids look exactly like me. Literally hair color, texture, dimples, face, smile. I've been told that we look like twins by others. But of course it's your uncles kids, kid. Sure.¬†

That's my story.

AITAH? My husband's family has all deemed me so. My family has also deemed me so.

I don't think I am. Especially given context.

Relevent Information before I'm asked:

1. The baby shower was in a home, no venue to cancel or deposit they lost out on. Everything to my knowledge was refundable or theirs already.¬†
2. My ils knew the rules as they were very on top of watching the news 24/7.
3. My Mom and Aunt also work in another hospital and although it's not patient care, they had to be constantly tested and follow the same procedures as the doctors/nurses/medical staff.¬†
4. I did not block anyone/go no contact solely because of this issue. It was merely the straw that broke the camels back. It is like a light switch went off and I just realized the relationships no longer serve me. (If they ever did)
5. I've been in therapy for about 5 years, twice a week to get over my crappy childhood.¬† ¬†
6. I did not get any of the ""gifts"" that were for my baby shower.
7. Not too long before ""my baby shower"" did extended family on my husbands side have something called drive-by baby showers, in which people dropped off gifts in their cars and watched as the mother opened them in their front yard. This could have been an option that they knew about, but didn't even consider, because again, I do not believe the baby shower was for me at all, but more so for them and their interests. (There were also FaceTime baby showers and gender reveals that people did).",,0.054604396,0,0

10,1dljop9,AITA for yelling at my gf‚Äôs best friend,"I(24M) have been dating my gf(21F) for about 1 1/2 years. In that same time I‚Äôve been frequently hanging out and driving my gf and her best friend(21NB). Since I‚Äôm the only one in this new friend group who has a car and a license; I became the designated driver for almost everything.

 They had an argument with my girlfriend about how she doesn‚Äôt need to involve me in everything; which is fair. However, I said that it goes both ways, which made things worse.

Some things were said, I raised my voice and admittedly I probably shouldn‚Äôt have yelled at them. They replied with how they don‚Äôt need me for anything, and how my driving is just easier than an Uber. At that point I was actually seething with anger. They got out my car after that, to ‚Äústop from escalating further‚Äù.

A month would pass where we didn‚Äôt talk but my girlfriend did relay that they wanted an apology for yelling at them. I agreed that I should but I took that as them seeing that I was in the wrong for being upset that for basically the entire duration that I‚Äôve known them, I was just a convenience. The mixed feeling I had solidified into resentment from that.

That was 3 months ago, since then my gf, her best friend and another person moved into a new apartment an hour from where I live. I had to give them rides again. They would tag along to anywhere my gf had to go. While they still wanted an apology I didn‚Äôt feel they deserved my apology. I knew for certain I would get an apology for feeling like any friendship I had with them wasn‚Äôt genuine. I knew it was gonna be thrown in my face. So I didn‚Äôt give them one. 

That leads to today where we were amicable. I was gonna take them to work after I had brought their boyfriend who lives an hour away to the apartment. My gf and her best friend kinda play fight and she makes the joke that I don‚Äôt have to take them and I said ‚Äútrue I don‚Äôt.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt seriously mean it but they took it that way. I saw they had took it that way and I didn‚Äôt care to convince them to let me take them to work for $15.

They got upset and ordered an Uber. When we were about to leave they told us that ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt going to beg to someone they‚Äôre paying anyway‚Äù
That struck a nerve but I tried to explain it wasn‚Äôt that deep but since it was their choice. It‚Äôs whatever. 

They complain that I haven‚Äôt apologized yet. I decide that if it‚Äôs happening today, I might as well try to get one as well. That talk ended with me telling them to never ask for a ride and slamming the door as I left.

It was childish to do so but I didn‚Äôt care at that point. I don‚Äôt regret anything I said but Ik it should have been handled better. AITA for losing my temper or should I have swallowed my pride and given them a lip service apology?


TL;DR - Helped out Gf‚Äôs best friend, hurt their feeling and never apologized. Caused problems.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-22,"AITA for yelling at my gf‚Äôs best friend I(24M) have been dating my gf(21F) for about 1 1/2 years. In that same time I‚Äôve been frequently hanging out and driving my gf and her best friend(21NB). Since I‚Äôm the only one in this new friend group who has a car and a license; I became the designated driver for almost everything.

 They had an argument with my girlfriend about how she doesn‚Äôt need to involve me in everything; which is fair. However, I said that it goes both ways, which made things worse.

Some things were said, I raised my voice and admittedly I probably shouldn‚Äôt have yelled at them. They replied with how they don‚Äôt need me for anything, and how my driving is just easier than an Uber. At that point I was actually seething with anger. They got out my car after that, to ‚Äústop from escalating further‚Äù.

A month would pass where we didn‚Äôt talk but my girlfriend did relay that they wanted an apology for yelling at them. I agreed that I should but I took that as them seeing that I was in the wrong for being upset that for basically the entire duration that I‚Äôve known them, I was just a convenience. The mixed feeling I had solidified into resentment from that.

That was 3 months ago, since then my gf, her best friend and another person moved into a new apartment an hour from where I live. I had to give them rides again. They would tag along to anywhere my gf had to go. While they still wanted an apology I didn‚Äôt feel they deserved my apology. I knew for certain I would get an apology for feeling like any friendship I had with them wasn‚Äôt genuine. I knew it was gonna be thrown in my face. So I didn‚Äôt give them one. 

That leads to today where we were amicable. I was gonna take them to work after I had brought their boyfriend who lives an hour away to the apartment. My gf and her best friend kinda play fight and she makes the joke that I don‚Äôt have to take them and I said ‚Äútrue I don‚Äôt.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt seriously mean it but they took it that way. I saw they had took it that way and I didn‚Äôt care to convince them to let me take them to work for $15.

They got upset and ordered an Uber. When we were about to leave they told us that ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt going to beg to someone they‚Äôre paying anyway‚Äù

11,1dljep5,AITA for telling my wife not to sit on the couch ? ,"My wife 32F and I 28M have been together for 8 years. Married for almost 3 years.

We both work full time jobs. I work throughout the week as a manager of a warehouse. I work about 40-45 hrs a week. Depending how busy it gets.

My wife works as a head chef at a restaurant in our town. She just became a head chef after being sous chef for a while. She can work absurd hours, depending on the day. 

The problem is, we purchased a new couch after having the same couch pretty much since we've been together. We both promised to take of the couch and try to prolong the life of the couch. 

I don't even sit down on it until I shower in fear of messing it up somehow. 

A few nights ago, she came pretty tired and threw herself on the couch, she sat there for about half an hour before getting up. I eventually ended up sitting where she sat and the couch smelled of a kitchen. It definitely didn't smell bad but it didn't smell nice either. Like greasy food.

I brought it up that she left thr couch smelling like grease. She said she forgot and to not let her do that again. 

Last night she came home again, pretty tired. When she was taking off her shoes, I reminded her not to sit on the couch until she showers or changes her clothes. She came over anyway and tried to sit down but I playfully blocked her by throwing my body in the way. 

She smacked her lips and said I can't do crap here and stormed off. 

She showered and was being very salty with me. I told her I was just joking but she said she wasn't trying to joke. She called me inconsiderate. I was just doing what she said

12,1dlj2s0,WIBTA for asking my friend NOT to bring her dog on our vacation?,"My friend group (four girls in our early twenties) is planning a small three day vacation to a local beach town on the west coast in a couple of months. One of my friends has a dog she enjoys bringing on occasional outings with us. Picnics, riding in the car, anything outdoors  in essence. 

However during the planning of this trip my friend has made it known she wants to bring the dog along because she‚Äôs ‚Äúnever seen that town‚Äù. And we need to find a hotel willing to accommodate a dog. Which as you can imagine is already a challenge. However we found a few good options in our price range. 

However I have a few issues. The first being I‚Äôm allergic to dogs. Now it‚Äôs not a deathly allergy however living in closed quarters for three nights will be a challenge for me. My second issue being the fact that we have to exclusively do activities that are dog friendly. We aren‚Äôt allowed to leave the dog in the building which we go to the beaches or walk the towns. However none of these beaches are pet friendly and I assume many restaurants and shops won‚Äôt allow animals inside either. 

I personally just feel like during a vacation I really don‚Äôt want to be concerned with accommodating for a dog who doesn‚Äôt need to be there. If I back out or explain my concerns I can easily see my friend being angry with me. She really does love this dog and doesn‚Äôt understand when I don‚Äôt want him riding in my car or constantly jumping on me

13,1dliige,"AITA for givng my Fiance√® the princess treatment, then asking her to help out more around the house?","For context, my fiancee R (F25) has muscle fatigue in her legs, as well as adhd. And I (F25) have jumpers knee in both my knees, as well as autism and adhd. 
My love language is spoiling tf out of my fiancee, it can get to a point where I push myself too hard just to show her I love her. It was recently her birthday, I took her out shopping for the whole day, then we went to an escape room and dinner with our mutual friend (F25) we will call her A. Because of my autism I was socially drained, and cause of my knees I was physically tired. Me and R have been taking the past couple days to relax and recharge. But 2 people with adhd = a messy house. Our house has gotten pretty bad lately. Today R went out with MIL, who lives out of town. I was supposed to go with but I don't like MIL's boyfriend. So I told R that I would clean the house instead of going with. 
So I slowly cleaned and tidied up the house and folded laundry. When R got home, the first thing she said was 'I was expecting the dishes to at least be done by the time I got home' and just dropped her bags and food on the floor, AND she just left her shoes in the middle of the living room. She didn't comment on how ALL the laundry was cleaned and folded, or how I had vacuumed. Now we don't live in a big place so when it starts to get messy it gets cluttered. I had also taken out the trash and recycling.
R is now asleep taking a nap before we go over to A's place.
I feel like a slave just doing all this cleaning and then not getting any appreciation.
This also isn't the first time that I've cleaned like hell and gotten no help or appreciation or anything but her lazing around. I asked her to help out more and I'll admit I raised my voice at her and started to cry. I was just frustrated. 
Now I feel like shit for yelling at her. 
There's more to this whole story but I just need help with today's events.
Sorry if this was hard to follow I wrote it on my phone.
