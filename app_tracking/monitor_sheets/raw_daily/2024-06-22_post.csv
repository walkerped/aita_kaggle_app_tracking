0,1dlp9be,AITA for refusing to interact with my cousin or go to family gatherings where they are present,"Throwaway for privacy. I (16) have been refusing to interact (text, talk, call with, etc.) with my cousin (17) for about 2 years now. This is due to a situation that happened over Christmas break at my grandmothers house, where they had come into my room, closed the door behind them, and (in the middle of a conversation) told me that they had thought about walking into my room and ‚Äúcatching me masturbating‚Äù. For extra context, I am an FtM man who presents feminine(ish) and they had, at the time, identified as male. Ever since this happened I‚Äôve had nightmares about them, broken down at the thought of seeing them for an extended period of time, become afraid of being in locked rooms with other people, and become sexually repressed. 

I‚Äôve barely talked with them since then, and my entire family has noticed this. We were never really close to begin with, but my avoidance of them have been pointed out by both my uncle (their father) and recently, my own father. It‚Äôs even gotten to the point where my uncle has called me a brat, among other things, to my parents. I‚Äôm not close with my parents at all, so they don‚Äôt know what happened (this is one of three times I‚Äôve actually talked about it, with the other two happening while I was inhibited). 

It‚Äôs begun to come to a head recently, though, now that I‚Äôm legally old enough to stay home alone and away from any family gatherings. My father has also begun to guilt trip me a little too, with him telling me that my cousin is trans (I don‚Äôt know whether their MTF or nonbinary, which is why I‚Äôve been using they/them) and not out to their parents, saying that since I‚Äôm also trans I should support them. 

I don‚Äôt want to ever see them again, but I also know how difficult it can be to not have support within your own family. I genuinely just don‚Äôt know what to do, whether I should just move past what happened or keep avoiding them.

1,1dlkwa6,AITA for wanting a courthouse wedding?,"Hey everybody! I'm going to make this post simple and sweet. I just want some advice. So, my fiance and I just got engaged last month during a trip to Oklahoma. It was magical and special, and of course, she said yes! So wooo, everything is happy! Anyway, I won't be using any actual names just out of respect for privacy, but I'll be referring to my future mother-in-law simply as MIL. 

My fiance and I began making wedding plans. We knew from that start that we wanted to get married in her hometown simply because she has more family there, and it'd be easier to fly my family there versus vice versa, so we'd have an easier time getting family together. My fiance and I aren't huge wedding people; it's not the kind of thing where she's been dreaming of some big extravagant wedding or anything like that. We want to celebrate our love for each other while surrounded by close family and friends and invest more of our energy and money in our honeymoon. Anyway, this plan wasn't working so much for my MIL.

To summarize, my MIL has tried to get us to change the date three times, asked us to do a venue and go all in, and has expressed her dismay with us getting married in a courthouse. She was wed in a courthouse and regrets it, so she kind of pushes that regret onto us in a way to guilt us into doing a bigger wedding when all that we want to do is fly there for a week, have the courthouse wedding surrounded only by very close family and friends and then to spend the rest of our trip just being around her family before we zip to our honeymoon so at some point we cave and we're like alright we can at least do a small venue and stuff.

Recently, my MIL came into some fortune, $21,000 to be specific, and she tells my fiance and me about this when it happens; of course, we're happy and ecstatic for her. $21,000 is massively helpful in almost any household, so that's incredible. Of course, we're happy for her. During that same phone call, she promised to pay for two of our friend's flights, my parents' flights, and a condo to stay at during the wedding. The next day, she messages us and tells us how she spent $15,000 on a concert. $9000, which is solely for the concert tickets. I'm a big stranger to concerts, but I know they can get pricy and we really understand that it's her money and she can spend it however she wishes, but we felt a little hurt by it.  Anyways, she has since taken back what she said she was going to help with, and so we told her that on second thought, we kind of want to go back to the original plan and do a simple courthouse ceremony, and well, she got upset with that. She then went on to make some hurtful comments at my fiance for how she moved out at 18 and doesn't see her and stuff, which isn't true. It's not like we haven't tried, and she said at least her sister wouldn't just do some dumb courthouse wedding.

Anyways, we're just very hurt by everything and it has made our special day very stressful and we don't know what to do about it.

3,1dlksl7,AITA for calling my friends assholes and telling Emily she deserves better?,"I got into an argument with my friends. They disagree with me, but I really do believe they are wrong.

One of our friends gained weight because she was depressed and her bf pointed it out and said they should go work out every day. We'll call her Emily. Our other friends are a couple, Eva and Jake.

She was talking to us and told us that he said that. She said she hates living like this and she is going to go to the gym and turn around her life.

I told her that she deserved better, that he should have never said that to her. I said he should NEVER comment on her weight. You should never comment on a women's weight. It could make her insecure and he's an ass for that. If he didn't like it, he could leave.

But our other friend and her bf disagreed. He said that is part of normal communication while being in a relationship. He said, ""if you can't handle your partner communicating with you, you aren't really to be in a relationship.""

His gf, Eva, backed him up, which really annoyed me. She said she would have done the same thing if she were the bf and brought it up to have a discussion about it. She said there was nothing wrong with out and saying ""just leave"" is childish.

I said it's not childish. If he doesn't like it, he can go. But of course Emily was like, ""But I love him. I don't want our relationship to end.""

It really annoyed me and I told her that I was just saying that she deserved better. I've seen so many threads on AITA and they all agree it's a dick move to bring up working out/weight to your gf.

Now Jake was being rude. He said those people have never been in a relationship before, it is normal to talk about in a healthy relationship. 

They started making fun of how redditors always say to ""break up"" and how I sound like that. I felt super ganged up on and told them they were being assholes, but I know I was right.

4,1dlkq0k,"AITAH for being upset that my family had ""my baby shower"" without me. ","Hello Reddit,

This is my first time posting, and I don't really know what is typically done here other than people vote on whether you're the A or not. I'm posting because I'm curious what other people's reactions would be if they were in my situation. It also seems like I'm the odd one out since people think I'm crazy/rude/awful. And have been making their opinions known lately.

This situation happened right at the height of Covid in August of 2020. I don't want to make this a long post, but I do think all the information below is relevant to the story.

¬†1. My husband worked in a hospital with active covid patients.

2. ALL OF MY INLAWS WERE HIGH-RISK FOR CONTRACTING COVID.

3. At the time, pregnancy didn't make you high risk (we were still learning about the disease, now I believe it does? Not sure)

4. If I were to have a baby shower it would be towards the end of my pregnancy because that's when I would feel comfortable that the likelihood of a miscarriage is lower.¬†

Now on to the story...

Covid was pretty rough on all of us. At the time, I had a 3 year old and I was pregnant with really really bad nausea as well as aches and pains that seemed never ending. The nausea didn't even go away with medications.¬†I did my best to stop it, and just continued life as normal as possible, even though we were stuck inside and all of our activities were no longer happening.¬†

My husband, as I mentioned worked in a hospital, he dealt with covid patients. Because of this we were extremely careful. When he came home, he would remove his clothes and shoes in the garage. He would immediately put them in the washing machine. He would bathe in our downstairs bathroom, and then would come up to see us. We would sanitize and wear masks when necessary. Basically we followed protocols that were told to us at the time. My in-laws however had different plans. Which they are entitled to.¬†

They didn't quarantine, they didn't socially distance, they shared masks and had large gatherings at their houses. One of which was a wedding in their backyard. I didn't want to go, but my husband convinced me. We wore masks, social distanced, and didn't go inside the house. I will admit, I was angry because I was told everyone would be wearing masks, except the bride and groom. But no one did. I maintained my distance and told myself, I'm not doing that again. It was very obvious that I was trying to stay safe (my husband included).¬†

It was very hard to keep a 3 year old away from the people he loved. And I sincerely was doing it for their benefit knowing that we were the ones who could contract it (since my husband worked in healthcare) and give it to his family.¬†

One of my sils kept telling me that she would see us in a few weeks. I was confused at first, but didn't think much of it because I was too nauseous, and tired, and dealing with my toddler to try and decipher what that meant.¬†

When it came closer to the date, I had a feeling that she was throwing me a baby shower. However, I am not a baby shower type of girl. I don't mind if other people have them, I just don't like them for myself. I had one for my first kid and I told my mom and sil explicitly that I am ONLY doing this for you all and because it is the first grandchild on both sides. They knew this before my first baby shower, and they definitely knew this while planning this one. My husband has since told me that he told them I wouldn't like it.¬†

Because of this feeling, I texted my sister in law a few days before the date she told me. I asked if she was having a baby shower for me, and she said yes. I told her that I am not going to be able to attend, I have very bad nausea, (as I have been having, especially lately and I'm exhausted) and most importantly, it would be irresponsible of me or her to have something like this, given the circumstances. We were literally a town that had just become ""red"", which meant that numbers were going up pretty severely and they were warning us to remain 6 ft and whatever else advisory. I also told her that it's a really nice and thoughtful gesture, but I wouldn't be able to morally live with myself if we convened and someone got severely sick just because I wanted to party. (Which again, I didnt, and would never, as I am extremely introverted). She said okay and I thought it was done.

I get a call the next day from my friend saying that my sil called her to say I'm not coming to my baby shower and that I (my friend) probably don't want to go since I wouldn't be there. This friend was super super cautious (still is) and was only going to ""my baby shower"" to make me happy. She literally felt like she was risking her life. My sil told her safety precautions were going to be in place and that it would be outside. So she agreed. She called me surprised, because she thought it was a surprise for me. But then my sil called and told her that I knew and that I wasn't coming. So I told my friend yeah, I would never do this and especially during a time like this, especially knowing who my family is.

Unfortunately, literally no one in my family is healthy. High blood pressure, cancer, high cholesterol, heart issues, asthma, severe allergies, fragile bones, arthritis, just to name a few. And this is just off the top of my head with the inlaws and my moms side of the family.¬†

My friend and I hung up and I thought nothing of it. It's done. No harm, no foul, right? Wrong. I literally thought she (SIL) was making her calls to whoever she invited. Til this day, idk who was invited because I literally have 1 friend in this state. I thought it was over and done with either way.

The next day, my older cousin texts me and tells me that since I didn't show up to the baby shower and I didn't want the homemade cupcakes she made, she would take them back home with her.

I responded with... what??? You were invited?? It's happening??? How??? I was shocked. I couldn't believe that they had ""my baby shower"" without me!! I felt terrible because she is another one who literally had not left her house since March. She worked from home, her kid was home from school, her wife also worked from home, she had groceries delivered. The works. Again, another person risking their lives to ""please me"" but it wasn't for me. Especially knowing that they had the whole event without me, didn't cancel anything and didn't follow any supposed protocols. I was immediately angry, immediately hurt, shocked, whatever feeling, I likely had it. Other than happiness.

Til this day, I'm still confused as to how anyone would think it's okay to have a baby shower when the mother isn't present. Thankfully, I'm not angry/sad/hurt anymore. But it's definitely still insane to me.¬†

My husband immediately went into defending his family. My cousin told my mom and aunt that I was wasn't happy about what was going on. They both called and tried to defend themselves. My mom particularly said: ""I wanted to celebrate my grandchild, you can't stop me from doing that"".¬†And she's right, I can't stop her from doing that ( even though I think its crazy) but do it at your own party, with your own friends. Why make me aware of it at all? As though it was for me.

¬†I see this as a major betrayal. My mom and I have had a very tumultuous relationship. She has physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually been abusive. My aunt has defended her. My other aunts and grandmother think she can do no wrong. She's the one who told my sil to still have the party because according to my mom, ""I would show up"". But my sil knew I wouldn't because 1) I told her 2) she told my friend I wasn't going to be there, meaning my sil also knew I wouldn't be there 3) I gave my reasoning about covid being bad at the moment plus my other ailments. None of those stipulations had changed from one day to the other.

My ils were confused as to why I was angry. Like it was no big deal that the person who you are literally having the baby shower for isn't there.¬†I blocked all of my ils. I also blocked my mom and aunt. My cousin didn't know I wouldn't be there until she and her family made the 1.5 hour drive to my sils house. I wrote an email to my sil explaining why, with a long laundry list of things that were pretty similar to this, in the sense that they don't respect me, my boundaries, my generosity and my willingness to always go above and beyond and basically this is the respect I get. I don't need thank-yous. I need you to respect me and consider my feelings. But nope it's just about what they want, and they wanted to party so party without me they did.

My brother, who I still speak to, called me a week after the event to update me on his life. He went to the party, but he didn't know where he was going at first. My mom told him to jump in the car and told him she was going to a party. My brother didn't ask any questions (very typical of him). As they were driving, she told him that it was ""my baby shower"". And he was immediately surprised. He said that this ""wasn't for my sister, because if you knew her, you'd know that she wouldn't want this"". My mom told him that I knew about it. And nothing else. He decided to stay, because he was moving out of the country and this was his last time seeing all these people, at least for a long while. I still haven't seen him. So yeah. A long while.¬†

He said they wanted to take video to supposedly send to me and every time they would pivot to him, he would ""ruin it"" (according to them) by saying ""this isn't for {insert my name}"".¬†Again, this fact only further proves that they were aware, and that they saw nothing wrong with what they were doing.¬†

After I blocked them, I have gotten many passive aggressive things done to me. For example, when my son was born, my husband and kid, and new baby all got ""gifts"" from one sil congratulating them. Not me. Just them. Another sil delivered donuts and coffee for my husband and toddler with a card saying ""for all your hard work"". As though they did anything.¬†During the delivery, they constantly called to see if the baby was born, not to see how I was. So much so, that my husband wasn't ""present"" with me. And I can't help but think it was on purpose.¬†

After the baby was born, our doctor advised that no one see the baby for at least 3 months. We complied. My husband would often FaceTime and I would constantly hear ""oh he has dimples, like me (meaning my sil) when I literally have 2 dimples. Any feature of mine, that was very clearly mine. They would try and attribute it to themselves or some long lost relative of theirs. Very weird, when BOTH my kids look exactly like me. Literally hair color, texture, dimples, face, smile. I've been told that we look like twins by others. But of course it's your uncles kids, kid. Sure.¬†

That's my story.

AITAH? My husband's family has all deemed me so. My family has also deemed me so.

I don't think I am. Especially given context.

Relevent Information before I'm asked:

1. The baby shower was in a home, no venue to cancel or deposit they lost out on. Everything to my knowledge was refundable or theirs already.¬†
2. My ils knew the rules as they were very on top of watching the news 24/7.
3. My Mom and Aunt also work in another hospital and although it's not patient care, they had to be constantly tested and follow the same procedures as the doctors/nurses/medical staff.¬†
4. I did not block anyone/go no contact solely because of this issue. It was merely the straw that broke the camels back. It is like a light switch went off and I just realized the relationships no longer serve me. (If they ever did)
5. I've been in therapy for about 5 years, twice a week to get over my crappy childhood.¬† ¬†
6. I did not get any of the ""gifts"" that were for my baby shower.
7. Not too long before ""my baby shower"" did extended family on my husbands side have something called drive-by baby showers, in which people dropped off gifts in their cars and watched as the mother opened them in their front yard. This could have been an option that they knew about, but didn't even consider, because again, I do not believe the baby shower was for me at all, but more so for them and their interests. (There were also FaceTime baby showers and gender reveals that people did).",TL;DR,2024-06-22,"AITAH for being upset that my family had ""my baby shower"" without me.  Hello Reddit,

It was very hard to keep a 3 year old away from the people he loved. And I sincerely was doing it for their benefit knowing that we were the ones who could contract it (since my husband worked in healthcare) and give it to his family.¬†

One of my sils kept telling me that she would see us in a few weeks. I was confused at first, but didn't think much of it because I was too nauseous, and tired, and dealing with my toddler to try and decipher what that meant.¬†

When it came closer to the date, I had a feeling that she was throwing me a baby shower. However, I am not a baby shower type of girl. I don't mind if other people have them, I just don't like them for myself. I had one for my first kid and I told my mom and sil explicitly that I am ONLY doing this for you all and because it is the first grandchild on both sides. They knew this before my first baby shower, and they definitely knew this while planning this one. My husband has since told me that he told them I wouldn't like it.¬†

Because of this feeling, I texted my sister in law a few days before the date she told me. I asked if she was having a baby shower for me, and she said yes. I told her that I am not going to be able to attend, I have very bad nausea, (as I have been having, especially lately and I'm exhausted) and most importantly, it would be irresponsible of me or her to have something like this, given the circumstances. We were literally a town that had just become ""red"", which meant that numbers were going up pretty severely and they were warning us to remain 6 ft and whatever else advisory. I also told her that it's a really nice and thoughtful gesture, but I wouldn't be able to morally live with myself if we convened and someone got severely sick just because I wanted to party. (Which again, I didnt, and would never, as I am extremely introverted). She said okay and I thought it was done.

I get a call the next day from my friend saying that my sil called her to say I'm not coming to my baby shower and that I (my friend) probably don't want to go since I wouldn't be there. This friend was super super cautious (still is) and was only going to ""my baby shower"" to make me happy. She literally felt like she was risking her life. My sil told her safety precautions were going to be in place and that it would be outside. So she agreed. She called me surprised, because she thought it was a surprise for me. But then my sil called and told her that I knew and that I wasn't coming. So I told my friend yeah, I would never do this and especially during a time like this, especially knowing who my family is.

Unfortunately, literally no one in my family is healthy. High blood pressure, cancer, high cholesterol, heart issues, asthma, severe allergies, fragile bones, arthritis, just to name a few. And this is just off the top of my head with the inlaws and my moms side of the family.¬†

My friend and I hung up and I thought nothing of it. It's done. No harm, no foul, right? Wrong. I literally thought she (SIL) was making her calls to whoever she invited. Til this day, idk who was invited because I literally have 1 friend in this state. I thought it was over and done with either way.

The next day, my older cousin texts me and tells me that since I didn't show up to the baby shower and I didn't want the homemade cupcakes she made, she would take them back home with her.

I responded with... what??? You were invited?? It's happening??? How??? I was shocked. I couldn't believe that they had ""my baby shower"" without me!! I felt terrible because she is another one who literally had not left her house since March. She worked from home, her kid was home from school, her wife also worked from home, she had groceries delivered. The works. Again, another person risking their lives to ""please me"" but it wasn't for me. Especially knowing that they had the whole event without me, didn't cancel anything and didn't follow any supposed protocols. I was immediately angry, immediately hurt, shocked, whatever feeling, I likely had it. Other than happiness.

Til this day, I'm still confused as to how anyone would think it's okay to have a baby shower when the mother isn't present. Thankfully, I'm not angry/sad/hurt anymore. But it's definitely still insane to me.¬†

My husband immediately went into defending his family. My cousin told my mom and aunt that I was wasn't happy about what was going on. They both called and tried to defend themselves. My mom particularly said: ""I wanted to celebrate my grandchild, you can't stop me from doing that"".¬†And she's right, I can't stop her from doing that ( even though I think its crazy) but do it at your own party, with your own friends. Why make me aware of it at all? As though it was for me.

¬†I see this as a major betrayal. My mom and I have had a very tumultuous relationship. She has physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually been abusive. My aunt has defended her. My other aunts and grandmother think she can do no wrong. She's the one who told my sil to still have the party because according to my mom, ""I would show up"". But my sil knew I wouldn't because 1) I told her 2) she told my friend I wasn't going to be there, meaning my sil also knew I wouldn't be there 3) I gave my reasoning about covid being bad at the moment plus my other ailments. None of those stipulations had changed from one day to the other.

My ils were confused as to why I was angry. Like it was no big deal that the person who you are literally having the baby shower for isn't there.¬†I blocked all of my ils. I also blocked my mom and aunt. My cousin didn't know I wouldn't be there until she and her family made the 1.5 hour drive to my sils house. I wrote an email to my sil explaining why, with a long laundry list of things that were pretty similar to this, in the sense that they don't respect me, my boundaries, my generosity and my willingness to always go above and beyond and basically this is the respect I get. I don't need thank-yous. I need you to respect me and consider my feelings. But nope it's just about what they want, and they wanted to party so party without me they did.

My brother, who I still speak to, called me a week after the event to update me on his life. He went to the party, but he didn't know where he was going at first. My mom told him to jump in the car and told him she was going to a party. My brother didn't ask any questions (very typical of him). As they were driving, she told him that it was ""my baby shower"". And he was immediately surprised. He said that this ""wasn't for my sister, because if you knew her, you'd know that she wouldn't want this"". My mom told him that I knew about it. And nothing else. He decided to stay, because he was moving out of the country and this was his last time seeing all these people, at least for a long while. I still haven't seen him. So yeah. A long while.¬†

He said they wanted to take video to supposedly send to me and every time they would pivot to him, he would ""ruin it"" (according to them) by saying ""this isn't for {insert my name}"".¬†Again, this fact only further proves that they were aware, and that they saw nothing wrong with what they were doing.¬†

After I blocked them, I have gotten many passive aggressive things done to me. For example, when my son was born, my husband and kid, and new baby all got ""gifts"" from one sil congratulating them. Not me. Just them. Another sil delivered donuts and coffee for my husband and toddler with a card saying ""for all your hard work"". As though they did anything.¬†During the delivery, they constantly called to see if the baby was born, not to see how I was. So much so, that my husband wasn't ""present"" with me. And I can't help but think it was on purpose.¬†

After the baby was born, our doctor advised that no one see the baby for at least 3 months. We complied. My husband would often FaceTime and I would constantly hear ""oh he has dimples, like me (meaning my sil) when I literally have 2 dimples. Any feature of mine, that was very clearly mine. They would try and attribute it to themselves or some long lost relative of theirs. Very weird, when BOTH my kids look exactly like me. Literally hair color, texture, dimples, face, smile. I've been told that we look like twins by others. But of course it's your uncles kids, kid. Sure.¬†

That's my story.

AITAH? My husband's family has all deemed me so. My family has also deemed me so.

I don't think I am. Especially given context.

Relevent Information before I'm asked:

1. The baby shower was in a home, no venue to cancel or deposit they lost out on. Everything to my knowledge was refundable or theirs already.¬†
2. My ils knew the rules as they were very on top of watching the news 24/7.
3. My Mom and Aunt also work in another hospital and although it's not patient care, they had to be constantly tested and follow the same procedures as the doctors/nurses/medical staff.¬†
4. I did not block anyone/go no contact solely because of this issue. It was merely the straw that broke the camels back. It is like a light switch went off and I just realized the relationships no longer serve me. (If they ever did)
5. I've been in therapy for about 5 years, twice a week to get over my crappy childhood.¬† ¬†
6. I did not get any of the ""gifts"" that were for my baby shower.
7. Not too long before ""my baby shower"" did extended family on my husbands side have something called drive-by baby showers, in which people dropped off gifts in their cars and watched as the mother opened them in their front yard. This could have been an option that they knew about, but didn't even consider, because again, I do not believe the baby shower was for me at all, but more so for them and their interests. (There were also FaceTime baby showers and gender reveals that people did).",,0.054604396,0,0

10,1dljop9,AITA for yelling at my gf‚Äôs best friend,"I(24M) have been dating my gf(21F) for about 1 1/2 years. In that same time I‚Äôve been frequently hanging out and driving my gf and her best friend(21NB). Since I‚Äôm the only one in this new friend group who has a car and a license; I became the designated driver for almost everything.

 They had an argument with my girlfriend about how she doesn‚Äôt need to involve me in everything; which is fair. However, I said that it goes both ways, which made things worse.

Some things were said, I raised my voice and admittedly I probably shouldn‚Äôt have yelled at them. They replied with how they don‚Äôt need me for anything, and how my driving is just easier than an Uber. At that point I was actually seething with anger. They got out my car after that, to ‚Äústop from escalating further‚Äù.

A month would pass where we didn‚Äôt talk but my girlfriend did relay that they wanted an apology for yelling at them. I agreed that I should but I took that as them seeing that I was in the wrong for being upset that for basically the entire duration that I‚Äôve known them, I was just a convenience. The mixed feeling I had solidified into resentment from that.

That was 3 months ago, since then my gf, her best friend and another person moved into a new apartment an hour from where I live. I had to give them rides again. They would tag along to anywhere my gf had to go. While they still wanted an apology I didn‚Äôt feel they deserved my apology. I knew for certain I would get an apology for feeling like any friendship I had with them wasn‚Äôt genuine. I knew it was gonna be thrown in my face. So I didn‚Äôt give them one. 

That leads to today where we were amicable. I was gonna take them to work after I had brought their boyfriend who lives an hour away to the apartment. My gf and her best friend kinda play fight and she makes the joke that I don‚Äôt have to take them and I said ‚Äútrue I don‚Äôt.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt seriously mean it but they took it that way. I saw they had took it that way and I didn‚Äôt care to convince them to let me take them to work for $15.

They got upset and ordered an Uber. When we were about to leave they told us that ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt going to beg to someone they‚Äôre paying anyway‚Äù

TL;DR - Helped out Gf‚Äôs best friend, hurt their feeling and never apologized. Caused problems.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-22,"AITA for yelling at my gf‚Äôs best friend I(24M) have been dating my gf(21F) for about 1 1/2 years. In that same time I‚Äôve been frequently hanging out and driving my gf and her best friend(21NB). Since I‚Äôm the only one in this new friend group who has a car and a license; I became the designated driver for almost everything.

 They had an argument with my girlfriend about how she doesn‚Äôt need to involve me in everything; which is fair. However, I said that it goes both ways, which made things worse.

Some things were said, I raised my voice and admittedly I probably shouldn‚Äôt have yelled at them. They replied with how they don‚Äôt need me for anything, and how my driving is just easier than an Uber. At that point I was actually seething with anger. They got out my car after that, to ‚Äústop from escalating further‚Äù.

A month would pass where we didn‚Äôt talk but my girlfriend did relay that they wanted an apology for yelling at them. I agreed that I should but I took that as them seeing that I was in the wrong for being upset that for basically the entire duration that I‚Äôve known them, I was just a convenience. The mixed feeling I had solidified into resentment from that.

That was 3 months ago, since then my gf, her best friend and another person moved into a new apartment an hour from where I live. I had to give them rides again. They would tag along to anywhere my gf had to go. While they still wanted an apology I didn‚Äôt feel they deserved my apology. I knew for certain I would get an apology for feeling like any friendship I had with them wasn‚Äôt genuine. I knew it was gonna be thrown in my face. So I didn‚Äôt give them one. 

That leads to today where we were amicable. I was gonna take them to work after I had brought their boyfriend who lives an hour away to the apartment. My gf and her best friend kinda play fight and she makes the joke that I don‚Äôt have to take them and I said ‚Äútrue I don‚Äôt.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt seriously mean it but they took it that way. I saw they had took it that way and I didn‚Äôt care to convince them to let me take them to work for $15.

They got upset and ordered an Uber. When we were about to leave they told us that ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt going to beg to someone they‚Äôre paying anyway‚Äù

I brought it up that she left thr couch smelling like grease. She said she forgot and to not let her do that again. 

Last night she came home again, pretty tired. When she was taking off her shoes, I reminded her not to sit on the couch until she showers or changes her clothes. She came over anyway and tried to sit down but I playfully blocked her by throwing my body in the way.

So I slowly cleaned and tidied up the house and folded laundry.

Six months ago, I found out that I am pregnant.

We are over joyed and our families are, as well! ‚Ä¶except for my sister.

A few weeks following my pregnancy announcement, my mom and sister had a conversation about being realistic on if I would be able to take on all the duties of being her MOH while pregnant and later with an infant. My sister later spoke with me and told me that if I could not follow through with the duties of being her MOH - it was okay! They could find something else for me to be involved in, with the wedding. (For context, my sister and FBILs wedding party is so big that they have two best men and two MOHs) I discussed it with my family and husband‚Ä¶but I ultimately decided that it wasn‚Äôt fair to my sister or my child to make a promise to fulfill those duties when I would have a 3-4 month old infant and was generally unsure if I could do everything she needed of me. 

The wedding is two towns away, 30+ minutes drive, and I would either have to bring the baby with me for the day of the wedding (What bride and bridesmaids want to listen to a baby all day while they are getting ready?) or I would have to leave the baby with someone else (From around 8am that morning to somewhere between 6-8pm that night)

So I ultimately pulled out of the wedding party, about 12 months before the date. And intend to help with other things.

Important note: One of the symptoms of something I have is I overheat super easily (like much more than other people, and that it becomes distressing and uncomfortable verry quickly so I rarely wear long sleeves in there winter and just layer.

Main issue:
Today it is VERRY hot where I live (88 degrees Fahrenheit outside) so I am not able to go out today due to me possible passing out or just being very uncomfortable. So instead of going out I worked on some craft projects in my room as well as some summer cleaning my mom said had to be done before next Wednesday. I became overheated in my room so I asked to turn the AC on. My mom said no because it costs money ( we are rather well off and have no monetary concerns  but we aren‚Äôt rich we could easily afford AC for like an hour or two just to cool down the house) I decided to go downstairs where it was cooler and be with my parents. 
My mom kept reminding me I needed to get my room clean before Wednesday and becuse I am busy during summer I will be busy Monday and Tuesday so my plan was to do it tonight but it became way to hot. My mom said I could use the AC while working but the lowest I could put it was 78 Fahrenheit. That was hotter than when I came downstairs and when I said that she said too bad do it tomorrow.  I am very angry because we can easily afford to have the AC on upstairs and I need to get the room clean or she will punish me but she is making it extremely difficult and even painful for me to do so.
 I got upset and when she and my dad left for their anniversary dinner she told me ‚ÄúI hope you will be in a better mood when I get home‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúI would be in a better mood if I wasn‚Äôt sweating my butt off.‚Äù She got angry and called me an asshole before she left.

Important note: One of the symptoms of something I have is I overheat super easily (like much more than other people, and that it becomes distressing and uncomfortable verry quickly so I rarely wear long sleeves in there winter and just layer.

Main issue:
Today it is VERRY hot where I live (88 degrees Fahrenheit outside) so I am not able to go out today due to me possible passing out or just being very uncomfortable. So instead of going out I worked on some craft projects in my room as well as some summer cleaning my mom said had to be done before next Wednesday. I became overheated in my room so I asked to turn the AC on. My mom said no because it costs money ( we are rather well off and have no monetary concerns  but we aren‚Äôt rich we could easily afford AC for like an hour or two just to cool down the house) I decided to go downstairs where it was cooler and be with my parents. 
My mom kept reminding me I needed to get my room clean before Wednesday and becuse I am busy during summer I will be busy Monday and Tuesday so my plan was to do it tonight but it became way to hot. My mom said I could use the AC while working but the lowest I could put it was 78 Fahrenheit. That was hotter than when I came downstairs and when I said that she said too bad do it tomorrow.  I am very angry because we can easily afford to have the AC on upstairs and I need to get the room clean or she will punish me but she is making it extremely difficult and even painful for me to do so.
 I got upset and when she and my dad left for their anniversary dinner she told me ‚ÄúI hope you will be in a better mood when I get home‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúI would be in a better mood if I wasn‚Äôt sweating my butt off.‚Äù She got angry and called me an asshole before she left. Am I the asshole for being rude about the AC?",0.0,0.07963915169239044,0,1

I do not own a car, it is on the other side of the city. I called her and asked if everything was alright. Turned out she had eaten, had some rest, is safe and our friend got everything covered up.

So I proposed that I will pick her up to our place with my buddy who owns a car and was with me once they are leaving. She agreed, but the party didn't end till midnight, so my girlfriend got REALLY pissed off at me and my friends that they didn't leave sooner.

19,1dm8iag,AITA for my friend‚Äôs new gf feeling alienated on our Vegas trip?,"I organized a Vegas trip for my birthday. Joe, one of our best friends, RSVPd. A couple months before the trip he got a gf, I invited him to bring her. Our group included them, Joe‚Äôs roommate, another couple, my boyfriend, and me.

before the trip, Joe‚Äôs roommate wanted to join their planned ATV excursion which pissed Joe off for ‚Äústealing their idea‚Äù? He told me he would kept plans private going forward and reassured me he was fine with group events for my birthday dinner and show. It was his first gf in 6 yrs and he was excited to vacation w her. I told him I was cool with that and suggested we fit in a double date to get to know his girlfriend better.

Riding into the airport together, Joe suggested a strip club, his girlfriend's idea, but my boyfriend and I weren‚Äôt interested. Joe‚Äôs girlfriend was quiet, which I thought was due to shyness. At my birthday dinner, she was making an effort, but still quiet, whispering to Joe occasionally. After dinner, they abruptly left for the show without telling us or waiting for us, which felt rude.

The next day, we had all planned a pool day. By the time Joe and his gf joined we were out there for 3 hours. We ended up going in and taking a nap. Later, Joe texted that his girlfriend was crying, thinking we were avoiding her. I visited their room, reassured her we liked her, and maybe it was because I was trying to respect their personal time. We all agreed to better communication, but again she barely spoke. My boyfriend then invited Joe to play pool, but he didn‚Äôt respond. They stayed in their room.

That night, we went as a group to karaoke on Fremont but left due to a long wait and obnoxious DJs. Joe refused to leave, so we told them to meet us later we will be exploring nearby. 30 min later Joe said they were back at the Airbnb, fighting but working things out. Remembering how she felt alienated earlier, I texted her, ‚ÄúI hope everything is okay, here for you if you wanna talk.‚Äù She never responded, but Joe texted, ‚ÄúDo not text her!‚Äù

When we got back, her bags were packed and at the door. They stayed in their room. The next day, Joe ignored everyone. A friend greeted him with a good morning and got stonewalled. Joe‚Äôs girlfriend stayed in the room when a friend made us all a meal. Joe quickly ate and joined her. They seemed to have stopped fighting but still ignored us. She still hadn‚Äôt responded to me so I left her alone.

At that point, my boyfriend and I decided to stop trying and just worry about ourselves. We never did that double date. They spent the rest of the trip doing couple things. The morning we checked out, they left without saying anything and kept to themselves at the airport. It was so rude I removed them from my contacts and social media. I had already tried a heart-to-heart and it didn‚Äôt help.

I don‚Äôt understand where things went wrong, but was I somehow inadvertently the asshole?

In the time I work, and there are many restaurants, and there is one gentleman who walks through the town and visits at some of the stores on his way to work. He has high functioning autism. He can drive he has a job. He has a masters degree and several other things. I recently told him that I was pregnant so that he could prepare for my leaving for maternity. I let him touch my belly that day. He has been in every single day since, almost three weeks, to come try to touch my belly to feel the baby. The issue is I don't like to be touched. I also don't like people coming up behind me. For contacts I have complex PTSD. And people behind me is one of my triggers.  Also being the only employee I can't often stop. I have expressed to him many times that I cannot stop every day to let him touch my belly and he has recently taken up on him to walk behind me even while I'm with other customers to touch my belly. I told him that was no ok. He didn't come in for two days and when he did a few days later, he tried to touch my belly, but he asked so I said fine.

22,1dm88th,AITA for not going inside while tanning?,"I (f23) live in a basement suite with my husband (m25), and our ‚Äúyard‚Äù is actually our driveway plus about 5ft x 20ft of grass space. There is a shed placed there, and a bunch of stuff from the upstairs tenants, so basically we have the driveway for a yard.

Now, it‚Äôs officially summer, and I absolutely love to tan. Today was the first time i‚Äôve been able to get outside to do so, as it was finally clear.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm not a ‚Äútanaholic‚Äù, but I like to reserve a day and go outside maybe 5-6 times and have a couple hours worth of just chilling, drinking some wine, reading a book, listening to music, and taking my cat in the yard (she‚Äôs blind and 14, she just lays beside me and sniffs the dandelions). These days usually end with my husband joining me, and a fire pit going strong. I just love the glow I get, and it makes me feel very happy when I come inside after a long day of photosynthesizing. 

I used to just tan in the enclosed backyard where we have lived before, but this is an odd house set up, so I just moved our car forward and parked my tanning chair in front of it so that it‚Äôs mostly blocked from the road view. I figured to be polite for the neighbors, i wouldn‚Äôt be in direct line sight of the road. Basically anywhere I am in the ‚Äúfenced area‚Äù, I‚Äôm visible from the road. The only way I couldn‚Äôt be is if I moved to the North side of the building, and it‚Äôs all shade there.

Here‚Äôs where the problem comes in. My neighbor from across the way came over while I was outside earlier, and just said ‚ÄúHello, will you be going inside anytime soon?‚Äù I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be, but what could I help her with (only noon). She responded by saying ‚ÄúWell, my kids are about to come and play outside.‚Äù To which I said ‚ÄúGreat! Want a pool?‚Äù (we have a little inflatable kiddie pool, great for tanning also). She said ‚ÄúNo I want you to go inside, you‚Äôre disturbing me.‚Äù

At this point I knew exactly what was up, so I stood up and stood my ground and told her that if she wanted me to go inside because I was going to be distracting her children, then maybe she should discuss a little discipline with the little perverts she was raising. 

She did not like that at all, and started going off on me about decency and what not. I was wearing a classic bikini, nothing brash or trashy, and i *have* trashy bikini‚Äôs that I could‚Äôve worn but chose not too.

I‚Äôve never talked to this woman, i‚Äôve never seen her kids, and i‚Äôve never interacted with her up until this point other than a quick wave while waiting to pull in. 

My husband came outside and also told her off, until she finally flipped us off and went back inside. We stayed outside for an hour more.

My mom called me, and I told her about what happened, and she said I should‚Äôve just went inside, but I really feel like I didn‚Äôt need too. I pay to live here and am trying to use the space as best as I can, I live in a basement, I need all the sunlight I can get.

My best friend (let's call her Katy) and I surprisingly ended up in the same university and have the same class scheduler, we made friends over the semester, (really good friend according to Katy) bcz sometimes I feel as though that's only the case with her. I've had a rough past with friends during my childhood which had/has lead me to self-doubt and feelings of worthlessness thus being the reason why I'm always cautious when meeting new people. Ever since we've made these friends, I've started to feel very lost. Smthing that didn't bother me during our first semester but really gets to me now is that my friends forget my name and call me by my friends name, a lot of the time when we're talking about something as soon as I start talking, someone talks over me, even when I do talk no one really cares to listen and having to repeat yourself 3+ times and still have no one bat an eyelash in your direction is extremely humiliating. Most of the time me, Katy, and a guy friend (let's call him Jake) from our friend group hang out by ourselves, and almost every time we do, it's just the two of them talking to each other and joking around while I stand there just blending into the background. These are just a few of MANY many occurrences that have lead me to feel like this. Honestly, I've never felt this worthless, unloved, unheard, and made to feel like I am the most boring person they've ever met. I used to give myself shit for being boring and always letting everything I've felt go down the drain but I feel like all this that I'm feeling is creating a distance b/w me and Katy (not for her tho, she's having a great time and thinks everything is a-ok) . They all have a great time around each other and I'm so so happy for my Katy she's accomplished so much and I'll always be proud of the person she's become but I feel as if those feelings, care, and thought isn't reciprocated. No one ever asks me what's wrong with me when I'm down because they don't ever seem to take an interest in me I just feel like I'm a back up friend or that I'm just their for moral support, Katy is almost always with Jake and even when I seem to talk to her or anyone else in our group, I just get ignored. I feel like I don't even exist anymore to anyone and it's killing me. I've been so down since this has started happening since our first few weeks at university to the point where it's not only effecting my mental health but my physical health too.

Smthing that didn't bother me during our first semester but really gets to me now is that my friends forget my name and call me by my friends name, a lot of the time when we're talking about something as soon as I start talking, someone talks over me, even when I do talk no one really cares to listen and having to repeat yourself 3+ times and still have no one bat an eyelash in your direction is extremely humiliating. Most of the time me, Katy, and a guy friend (let's call him Jake) from our friend group hang out by ourselves, and almost every time we do, it's just the two of them talking to each other and joking around while I stand there just blending into the background. These are just a few of MANY many occurrences that have lead me to feel like this. Honestly, I've never felt this worthless, unloved, unheard, and made to feel like I am the most boring person they've ever met. I used to give myself shit for being boring and always letting everything I've felt go down the drain but I feel like all this that I'm feeling is creating a distance b/w me and Katy (not for her tho, she's having a great time and thinks everything is a-ok) . They all have a great time around each other and I'm so so happy for my Katy she's accomplished so much and I'll always be proud of the person she's become but I feel as if those feelings, care, and thought isn't reciprocated. No one ever asks me what's wrong with me when I'm down because they don't ever seem to take an interest in me I just feel like I'm a back up friend or that I'm just their for moral support, Katy is almost always with Jake and even when I seem to talk to her or anyone else in our group, I just get ignored. I feel like I don't even exist anymore to anyone and it's killing me. I've been so down since this has started happening since our first few weeks at university to the point where it's not only effecting my mental health but my physical health too. So chat, aita for over-exaggerating and over-thinking the situation or is there something really wrong here?",0.0,0.12868526577949524,0,1
24,1dm7ynb,AITA for expecting my (17f) friend (18f) to apologize to me after turning our whole friend group against me?,"This is my first reddit post so sorry if this sounds weird!! + ALL FAKE NAMES

I (17f) have a really big friend group which means we don‚Äôt get along 24/7. This happened back in October of last year. I, 16f and my friend, we can call her Cindy , 17f used to be super close. I really saw her as a big sister and our friend group all are apart of a niche school clique so we all were put in the same class together. That year there were a couple of new faces including Henry (15m at the time). I‚Äôm really extroverted so I became really good friends with him in the small span of the first 2 months of school. One day during spirit week we had a bonfire, I invited Henry and his then best friend Ken (15m) out along with Cindy so it‚Äôd be the four of us. Then she drops on me before the bonfire that she has a crush on Henry. I asked her about the age difference because though it‚Äôs not super weird it‚Äôs pretty weird in high school and people comment about it all the time especially because she‚Äôd be turning 18 before he even turned 16. She said it was fine and that she really liked him and I said alright. During the next two weeks Henry acted really different towards me and blocked me twice on 2 separate occasions which was weird because we were super close friends at this point. Along with this it got spread around that I was flirting with Henry at homecoming (which I didn‚Äôt think I did but a lot of people assumed so) and then rumors spread that Henry liked me. I started to like him back and we started dating. Cindy got really mad at this and told everyone about how horrible of a friend I was to anyone who‚Äôd listen and I did apologize to her at the end but this next part is where it get‚Äôs tricky.

Flash forward a few months it comes up that she‚Äôs actually gay and was in love with Georgia(18f) for the whole time she pretended to like Henry and used him as a rebound for her feelings since she didn‚Äôt come to terms with her sexuality. Georgia is a major player and while knowing Cindy liked her Georgia got with Cindy‚Äôs 2 closest friends and Cindy did not at all blame them for anything. Those friends are still very close with Cindy. Cindy also has said I‚Äôm not a good friend to anyone (she said this to my best friend).

27,1dm7fsf,AITA for making my roommate move out after I accidentally embarrassed her in front of her friends?,"I (21F) was living in a 2 bedroom college dorm with a friend of mine who moved out, and our suitemate Ryan who had the other room for themselves.

At the beginning of the school year I arrived a week later, meaning Ally had the dorm for herself for a bit, but there were dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen, the whole place smelled of weed, and when I entered our shared bathroom, there was a bag of trash lying on the floor. I ignored it and it just got worse.¬†

One night, I returned to our dorm to find the door locked. I figured she snuck her boyfriend in and when she opened the door she apologized saying it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. Needless to say she did it again many times after that. Ally would invite friends over, she would lock herself in our room with her boyfriend for hours, and even occupy the entire common area regardless of Ryan‚Äôs or my own feelings. On top of this, she was a complete mess, leaving chips scattered all over the couch and on the floor, our bathroom full of puddles and hair on the drains, and our shared room smelling like shit. I‚Äôm a huge believer in talking things out but every time I did she would storm off or try to turn things around on me saying things like ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me‚Äú or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so bossy, you sound like a mom, just mind your business‚Äù¬†

I came to our dorm after pulling an all-nighter during finals and I found Ally sitting on her bed with her friends sitting on mine.

It wasn‚Äôt until Ally‚Äôs friend rushed out of the bathroom that I realized what I did. I was so embarrassed by it and so was Ally who simply said ‚ÄúAre you fucking serious?‚Äù before leaving with her friends.

I didn‚Äôt know how to approach her after that and we simply stopped talking. It wasn‚Äôt until later that week that I returned to our dorm to find her side completely empty and a note stating she moved out.

Context: I dyed my hair the day before I had a funeral and got some hair dye in the sink by accident, I tried cleaning it up that day but it wouldn‚Äôt come off. 

It was one of my close friends (22M) mums funeral. It had quite a big affect on me and everyone else who attended mainly because he‚Äôs so young to lose his mother and she‚Äôs the only person he had. 

The day after I woke up with a severe migraine and felt physically sick whenever I moved. My mum asked me to clean the bathroom and I asked her if it would be okay for me to do it the day after as I felt really ill and emotionally drained from the day before. 

She then started screaming at me saying I was ‚Äúparasiting off my friends grief and that I‚Äôm a lazy ungrateful little b*tch who needs to stop making excuses‚Äù. She also threatened to kick me out. 

The same day I threw up all over my bedroom floor multiple times and I have emetophobia which caused me to have a severe panic attack. All she said to me was ‚Äúyou better clean that up and you‚Äôre disgusting‚Äù. I cleaned it up and just went to bed without cleaning up the bathroom. 

I did clean it the day after like I said I would but she didn‚Äôt apologise for her treatment the day before. 

We had a conversation about it a few days ago and I talked about how much she hurt me with what she said about me being a parasite. She made an excuse by saying that she said that because I was faking being ill to get out of doing the job she asked me to do. 

All I want is an apology and for her to take accountability because she really hurt me.

31,1dm6vma,"AITA for ""overreacting"" about being touched by my guests at a party, and my parents telling me that it wasn't a big deal.","Context: I (16m) am a Filipino, who is going to the gym and training consistently. As a result, I'm quite muscular.

This began today, as I was having a party. I went to greet the guests, and the guests (who are my ""family"" according to my parents, even though they are just really close friends) started touching my body (not anywhere inappropriate but rather my chest, biceps and shoulders). I felt violated and that I had no rights because as the party continued, they also were commenting over my body, calling it beautiful and stuff along that line.

When the guests left, I asked my parents about it, saying that I felt violated when they touched and commented over me. My mom (54f) responded with they were just complementing me and my dad (55m) said that I was weird for not accepting my culture and that if 100 people think it isn't weird but I think it is then I'm wrong. It ended with my mom saying that if I felt so bad then I should tell them to stop next time, also saying it would be embarrassing. My dad said that I wasn't mature enough, that he was more mature and older, which meant his arguement was right, and that as parents, they were my gods in this world. 

I just had another half an hour talk with my parents. It was horrible, I was just getting lectured that what they did was okay and I should be proud of it. They thought I was overreacting.

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-22,"AITA for ""overreacting"" about being touched by my guests at a party, and my parents telling me that it wasn't a big deal. Context: I (16m) am a Filipino, who is going to the gym and training consistently. As a result, I'm quite muscular.

This began today, as I was having a party. I went to greet the guests, and the guests (who are my ""family"" according to my parents, even though they are just really close friends) started touching my body (not anywhere inappropriate but rather my chest, biceps and shoulders). I felt violated and that I had no rights because as the party continued, they also were commenting over my body, calling it beautiful and stuff along that line.

When the guests left, I asked my parents about it, saying that I felt violated when they touched and commented over me. My mom (54f) responded with they were just complementing me and my dad (55m) said that I was weird for not accepting my culture and that if 100 people think it isn't weird but I think it is then I'm wrong. It ended with my mom saying that if I felt so bad then I should tell them to stop next time, also saying it would be embarrassing. My dad said that I wasn't mature enough, that he was more mature and older, which meant his arguement was right, and that as parents, they were my gods in this world. 

I just had another half an hour talk with my parents. It was horrible, I was just getting lectured that what they did was okay and I should be proud of it. They thought I was overreacting.

36,1dm5z2i,"AITA for confessing the truth to my girlfriend and breaking up with her, only for her to cut full contact but stay in touch with my friends? ","So I (16M) met Lily (17F) When I was 15, me and her connected fast and got to know eachother almost straight away. Then after around 4-6 weeks of talking we started dating, everything was alright at first there were little to no signs of anything wrong. 

I treated her with lots of affection and time, understanding her feelings too. 

But eventually, my mental health started declining due to my personal life and I broke up with her because of it. She overreacted and I apologised for it. However after our breakup we continued to talk to the point we were almost best friends too, but never dating. 

The night before my 16th birthday, she asked me out and I considered it for awhile then accepted it with an open embrace, it was amazing for awhile. Despite her being my first girlfriend, however it started to take a major downfall a few weeks later. 

The first signs were when me and her were chatting in a friend group, and also talking in a call. Playing some games online with eachother. Then she remarked saying something on the lines of ‚ÄúGuys I need help how do I kill my boyfriend‚Äù. Now at first it may seem like a major red flag, but since me and her were playing minecraft at the time I assumed it were then, however at the time I saw it differently and had to leave the call and question my thoughts. Then I messaged her privately about it, to which she broke down and started apologising profusely and putting on the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough for you‚Äù act. Which I was not standing for, although we had resolved it a few hours after and continued to date. That incident always lingered on my mind. 

The second sign is when she stopped talking to me as much too, and because we had this long distance relationship going, I was mainly worried because of the situation in her country. (Mine in the UK for some context) and I was worried she could be killed or fatally wounded without me knowing then having to deal with that grief when I eventually find out. I will not say her country incase

Then, very recently too. She pointed out that she was not thinking I loved her enough. I spoke with her daily and as much as she could when she was online, and then we were not talking as much. I said that she needed confidence in the relationship and ask for what she wants so we can communicate our desires and what we want from each other in the relationship. Then we continued to talk until this moment, and at this point I lost my love for her because if everything she had done to which I was not looking for in a relationship. 

I messaged her whilst she was asleep, talking about the whole situation. I will not say everything and stick to the context, but I mainly was speaking on the lines of trying to find a boyfriend in real life and keeping thirst sorts of relationships away.  The lack of confidence too and not being able to communicate heya you want also is not something I‚Äôm looking for either. And that constant worry that she could be injured at any minute because if her country situation too which just stresses me out a lot. 

And today, I checked my messages to which she said that she understood. I saw this and passed it on, also having to remind her about the private things we had said to eachother privately kept in our Dm‚Äôs. To which she agreed. Now she had overreacted and accused me of saying nasty things to her face when I just spoke my mind. Since I wanted her to understand how I feel too. I denied the allegations and she instigated it more saying at how she was going to tell everyone about it.  When she got offline I started speaking with a close friend of mine and showed them the breakup message. He understood where I was coming from and that he saw it as a good thing to say rather than lying about the love I have for her.

37,1dm5m4c,AITA for refusing to let my FIL watch football anymore ,"I (22F) have to get up at 7am in the morning to leave for work and I do work jobs so I'm very tired at the end of the day. Recently there was a International cricket tournament going on and now a Football Cup which my Husband and FIL along with my FIL's caretaker watches. I barely know about sports and am too busy to watch. The cricket cup would end by midnigh but the football one in local time ends at around 4 am in the morning which means all three men watch it on TV in my bedroom where I sleep which has the only one TV where live football can be streamed and is fixed to the wall and the other TVs are too old and doesn't support streaming and only have local/regional channels 

It was fine for a few days . We have in past together seen movies. But that was like once in 6 months. But this football tournament is going to go for about a month and everyday it's becoming intolerable for me to have the lights and tv on cheering while I'm trying to sleep. 

My husband has very flexible working hours and works from home so he can get up anytime he wants. And my FIL is like 80, retired and a very lonely man (MIL died a couple of years ago). I don't like saying no to him because he is older than my grandfather and i respect him a lot. But him sitting in my bedroom from 9 pm till 2 or 4 o'clock in the morning is something I don't like anymore. I've tried to tell my husband several times how them being there affects my sleep as I have to work 13 hours the next day. 
He just shrugs and says that his father will take offense if he asks him to not come as seeing football together has been a tradition for them. This led to me being very pissed off and I am not talking to my husband anymore. He is now all sad and stuff. 

But my friends and family had shown concern over this and asked me to ask my FIL directly. I'm just afraid he might be hurt because he is a proud man and will take these things to heart and he might end up not coming to my room at all which is bad as he barely goes anywhere else, most times we have to put in so much effort just to get him out of his own room as he has lots of health problems and can't walk very far.

40,1dm4ma9,AITA for butting into my mom and aunt‚Äôs conversation?,"My mom and her sister were on the phone today and I was nearby.
When they talk and I happen to be around, I loosely pay attention, mostly because there's a history of my aunt berating and talking down to my mom in their past amongst other shitty things she's done, 
and my mom making excuses for my aunt's behavior. Sometimes when my aunt gets disrespectful I'll call my mom or something and give her an excuse to end the call. My mom usually appreciates this.
Today their conversation got a bit heated. At some point it was starting to wind down as they both realized it wasn't going anywhere. 
Then suddenly my aunt called my mom a coward in a pretty nasty tone.
At first I couldn't really believe what I heard, since she hasn't gone as far as insulting my mom in front of me before. So I whispered to my mom ""what did she say?"" And my mom repeated it to me, and then I said in the most polite tone I could, ""Hey, Auntie, don't call my mom a coward."" 
My aunt was instantly livid with me and went off about how I was disrespectful, had no business butting into their call, I‚Äôm badly raised, uneducated and what terrible behavior that was, and that she's been my mom‚Äôs sister longer than l've been alive.
I replied that her calling my mom a coward for her health decisions was also disrespectful, and that I'm sorry but if I hear her insult my mom I would intervene, that at no point had I insulted her in the conversation nor did I want to argue, but that insulting my mom was wrong of her and I wouldn't stand down about that.
She went on about how I dint respect my elders and I'm a little girl with no manners, and I reiterated that I didn't insult her at any point and that my only issue was the way she talked to my mom. Then she hung up cause she ‚Äòdidn't want to hear another word out of me.‚Äô
While part of me regrets intervening in their conversation, I also feel that I had to make it clear that talking that way to my mom was unacceptable behavior and that I wouldn't tolerate it.
My mom isn‚Äôt mad at me but says I overreacted, because she doesn't mind the things my aunt says to her so why make a fuss about it and upset my aunt.
My dad agrees with me and thinks my aunt was out of line, and that she should know that my mom isn't just her little sister who she could treat however she wanted to anymore, that she has a husband and daughter that will defend her and my aunt should behave appropriately.
Personally, I believe family is more than blood, and she's never been a good sister to my mom, so she has no right to talk to her any which way without pushback because of a title or her age. But I do recognize, it wasn't my conversation.

At first I couldn't really believe what I heard, since she hasn't gone as far as insulting my mom in front of me before. So I whispered to my mom ""what did she say?"" And my mom repeated it to me, and then I said in the most polite tone I could, ""Hey, Auntie, don't call my mom a coward."" 
My aunt was instantly livid with me and went off about how I was disrespectful, had no business butting into their call, I‚Äôm badly raised, uneducated and what terrible behavior that was, and that she's been my mom‚Äôs sister longer than l've been alive.
I replied that her calling my mom a coward for her health decisions was also disrespectful, and that I'm sorry but if I hear her insult my mom I would intervene, that at no point had I insulted her in the conversation nor did I want to argue, but that insulting my mom was wrong of her and I wouldn't stand down about that.
She went on about how I dint respect my elders and I'm a little girl with no manners, and I reiterated that I didn't insult her at any point and that my only issue was the way she talked to my mom. Then she hung up cause she ‚Äòdidn't want to hear another word out of me.‚Äô
While part of me regrets intervening in their conversation, I also feel that I had to make it clear that talking that way to my mom was unacceptable behavior and that I wouldn't tolerate it.
My mom isn‚Äôt mad at me but says I overreacted, because she doesn't mind the things my aunt says to her so why make a fuss about it and upset my aunt.
My dad agrees with me and thinks my aunt was out of line, and that she should know that my mom isn't just her little sister who she could treat however she wanted to anymore, that she has a husband and daughter that will defend her and my aunt should behave appropriately.
Personally, I believe family is more than blood, and she's never been a good sister to my mom, so she has no right to talk to her any which way without pushback because of a title or her age. But I do recognize, it wasn't my conversation.
So, AITA for butting into the conversation even though my aunt insulted my mom?",0.0,0.12096726149320602,0,1

So I (22M) met him (58M) on a language learning app. We're learning the same language and quickly became what I thought was friends. I would join his room, speak with him he would invite people teaching him and I would talk with them it was great. His profile said not to talk personal stuff but he would say half of something personal, and as a friend would do I get curious and ask him various how's and why's ect usually about his job, relationship ect and he would talk with me. I cared about him. I speak a little better than him but it's minimal (he has better vocabulary, I have a better listening ect) but often I would speak the language to people and often he wouldn't understand. The only thing I knew I did that was wrong in hindsight was that I would often answer questions on his behalf when he couldn't understand the question. For example someone would ask ""What country do you live in"" and he would struggle for a few seconds and I would say the country name, or his motivation for learning the language was another example: He had the word ""Relationship"" and I had the grammar ""I am in a..."" I would make friends with his teachers this way sometimes (Which does feel quite scummy now). 

So today out of the blue he sends me a message: ""I find it disrespectful for you to poach the people I invite to teach me the language, to then go and teach you"" this was ridiculous. I made friends not teachers...but apparently now I'm disrespectful? For talking to people in the language, for making friends? I made it clear to him that I had done nothing wrong when it came to the disrespectful claim, I found that very offensive.

43,1dm4d2k,AITA for telling my brother lower the volume of his phone at 1 am?,"Now, this may sound ridiculous, but the amount of backlash I received from him really makes me question this. For context, I (16F) have an older brother (21M). Our relationship isn't the best, he is the kind of bully that makes fun of everything you do, but does not allow you to make fun of anything of his. I can answer any detail you want to have a proper judgment on this situation.

what happened is that yesterday, my brother stayed very late watching films on his computer. I had an important event today and I had to wake up early ( he was aware of that ). My room is next to his and I kid you not I was able to hear what the characters were saying( it did not help that the movie was an action one). After the movie was done, he started playing short videos on his phone with the same high sound. Around 1:30 in the night I got fed up, I shouted at him in the most respectful, half asleep voice that I can make:"" Brother! Reduce the sound!"". He told me to mind my business and I did so since he lowered the volume, who am I to complain.

Now the problem started the next day. I got my period and spend the entire day in agonizing pain. When I was trying to get a glass of water at the kitchen he came to me. He started talking in a low voice so that our mother doesn't hear us. Basically, he started blaming and threatening me. He said that I did that to show off to our father (don't know where he got that from). He said that he jokes and laughs with me but I should know my limit. He said that he does not need to hurt me to make my life hell. I stared at him with an irresponsive and stupid look, he sure as hell can't surpass all this pain and tiredness within me so I was not in the mood to care honestly. He stormed out of the kitchen and we haven't talked since.

45,1dm3ybh,AITA for how I handled a situation regarding my ex-friend and my condition? ,"For relevant context: I (24F) was released from inpatient mid-Feb after coming close to attempting to not exist anymore, was diagnosed with BPD.

I was a shitty person, for a very long time. I hurt a lot of people, was manipulative, used people, had no operational empathy. I am in treatment and unlearning my negative behaviors. 

S is one of the last two friends I have who knew me during high school. He's one of the many guys I dated, one of the two I dumped immediately after prom (the other being his best friend a year later.) and has stuck around. I've apologized many times. He has forgiven me just as many, defended me when people shit talked me, etc. In turn, I've offered emotional support numerous times, have encouraged him to seek treatment he needed, etc. Always rejected.

I let him know both I was released from inpatient, and a while after, my new diagnosis of BPD. We catch up. 

A few months, he‚Äôs not great. I offer advice, reassure him he's not alone, and explain to him that any healthy relationship (friends or otherwise) he should be able to talk to his friends and any partners about what he's going through. It's a balance of give and take. A month passes. He thanks me for the advice, says it was very useful, he's found a girl he really likes and didn't understand give and take until recently.

A few weeks. The girl blocked him, she has BPD.  He tells me he doesn't think he could handle a relationship with someone with BPD, says my partner is far patient than he ever could be, and sends me a screenshot with someone calling all people with it ‚Äúfucking animals‚Äù. I am angry, explain, and ask for context. He said he wanted advice. I calm down, thank him for the context, and provide my take on what it feels like to have it. He thanks me. then continues digging. Reaches out to my partner in the meantime. I tell him I'm available to call if he needs anything, but he's being a bit of a jerk rn. 

A day passes, he says he‚Äôll take me up on the call, he elaborates on why it's hard to reach out due to trauma (valid!) Then he explains he‚Äôs been patient, he ‚Äútolerated‚Äù my breakdowns, and while I'm not too much to handle, brings up my prior lack of empathy and says I will never learn to empathize like him ‚Äúbefore he dies‚Äù. and if I have ‚Äúany semblance of care‚Äù I'll recognize he's not doing well.

I tell him he's weaponizing my disorder. I'm here to support him, but I'm not the same person I was. I explained I was offering kindness, and he was infantilizing me in response. I explained I had empathy, and he hurt me badly with him using my disorder against me. I tell him if he can't recognize that or that I've changed it's best we aren't friends.

 He tells me I twisted his words against him, made it about me, have always and am continuing to make him ‚Äúand probably those around [me] feel like dirt‚Äù, brings up moments I used him, says I'm degrading his mindset and it's ‚Äúfucking atrocious‚Äù and to stay out of his inbox.

Things got real compilcated during this summer, however, as I have to work more hours and attend summer school. I attend summer school cause my grades got all messed up when I transferred and I have to make up for it. Having work 5 hrs shifts and studying at the same time really wore me down. I complained during this Saturday to my mom about my workload of the house, that I wanted my brother to do all of the housework because he doesn't have to work like me. She chew me up that I shouldn't compare and be jealous of my brother because he does not stay home by choice, that no one is gonna hire a 15 yrs old and summer school just ran out of slots for him. My brother overheard the conversation, chime in that he already did all the cooking for me since I was at school. I was mad at this point that both my mom and my brother is not hearing me out. 

Things really escalate when I said "" Well fuck me for trying to get my life on track then. Guess I won't be going to summer school anymore"". That pissed my mom even further and say that I'm the older one, I should be helping my brother, that when he grows up he'll have to do even harder work than me. Saying blood is thicker than water, all that jazz. My brother even said ""You work and study for yourself now do you?"". 

To prevent things getting worse, I eat lunch alone. I now have some time to reflect and I'm still not sure why I'm in the wrong here. I guess I might be the AH because I talk back to my mom. And I feel kinda guilty too since my mom did work all her life and still have to get home and take care of me. As for my brother, he might be upset because all of a sudden he has more chores to do and he thought it is unfair to him.

One of the friends, Mazo, will find jobs for the business they all work in and offer it to my bf. The next morning when my boyfriend is supposed to be on his way to the job, Mazo will call with some excuse as for why the job was cancelled, when he actually gave the job to Chet instead.

54,1dm2rrb,AITA for making my roommate remove his aluminum foil from the toaster oven instead of just doing it myself?,"I got paired up kinda randomly into a 2 person apartment with a kitchen at a University and we generally get along but occasionally we butt heads.  We both sometimes use the toaster oven to cook, but my roommate often leaves his aluminum foil in the toaster oven when he's done instead of throwing it away in the trash.

The first time this happened, I just threw out the dirty aluminum foil before putting in clean foil and cooking my food.  The second time, I told my roommate it happened twice and that he needed to clean up after himself in the future.  The third time, I told him he did it again and he should come clean it up himself right now so I can cook my food.  This all happened within like a week or two.

It happened more times, and the guy started getting really frustrated that I was interrupting whatever he was in the middle of to have him come retrieve his dirty foil from the toaster oven so that I could immediately begin cooking my food.  His position was that it only takes a few seconds for me to remove the foil myself in the case where he forgets to do it and is busy with something else.  

My major is education so I might be a bit biased, but I tried to explain to him that if I keep just cleaning up after him then this crap will keep happening, whereas if I make him stop what he's doing to clean it up he'll be motivated not to repeat the mistake.  He was very offended that I was trying to use my educational techniques on him.  Pretty sure he thinks I'm a total a-hole for this but I think I'm fully justified in interrupting what he's doing to have him empty the toaster oven so that I can cook.

Her first word was Dada, her first steps were spent walking over to me, whenever she wants a hug she reaches out to me, and whenever we feed her my wife struggles to get her to open her mouth to actually eat while she'll eat anything I try to give her without hesitation.

Yesterday after we put out daughter to bed my wife asked to speak with me about something important.

She pulled me aside and said she was worried about our daughter's behavior, she said she was worried about her growing up not loving her mother as much as her father.

I was sympathetic towards her because I definitely thought the same thing for a little while.

I told her she should sign up for a mommy and me class because it would be a great opportunity for them to bond, but she said she's to busy to do something like that.

So I asked what she wanted to do and her answer shocked me.

She said she'd like me to leave the house for a week to stay with my sister without telling my daughter first, she said that would practically force her and our daughter to bond.

I said absolutely not. To me that sounded like the worst plan in the history of mankind.

She tried to convince me, saying it was the best option.

I called her selfish and told her she was out of her mind to expect me to abandon our daughter when she's so young for any amount of time.

She said that I was actually the selfish one for hogging my daughter's attention and called me an asshole.

She then stormed into the guest bedroom and slept there for the night.

And today she's done nothing but ignore me, and whenever she sees me do anything with our daughter she glares at me.

I'm pretty confident I'm in the right, but I've still gotta ask.

59,1dm1st9,"AITA for wanting my own room to sleep in, away from my SO?","Hello!
I (F23) and my significant other (F25) have been dating for 4 years, and we have been exploring the option of moving in together pretty soon.

I've been living with my parents the past 22 years, and have had my own bedroom the whole time. It's important to me to have my own space if I need some alone time, or if I just want to sleep alone. Even when dating someone.

So 2 days ago, when we were just hanging out at her house, we were looking for an appartement, I mentioned this to her, saying that I would prefer to have a spare room in the case I just need to sleep alone. Not that I dislike sleeping in the same bed as her, but some days I get really overwhelmed and overstimulated (and she knows this) and that's when I need my alone time. I also wouldn't sleep in this seperate bedroom every night, just the times I really need it or just feel like sleeping alone.

When I mentioned this, she looked kind of sad, and jokingly asked if I didn't like sleeping in the same bed as her.
I explained my point of view, that it's nothing personal to her and just my personal preference as someone who needs to recharge alone sometimes. She looked even more sad, and just closed the website we were on and walked away, to her room.
I decided to leave her alone for a few minutes, but did go after her eventually. But when I knocked on the door she just told me to go home. So I did.

She's been ghosting me since and I feel really guilty. I wanna reiterate that wanting a seperate room is nothing personal to her specifically, but I feel like maybe I'm unreasonable for asking for something like that.

When I get extremely stressed out my brain and body dont know how to react and I have an event (pass out and convulse for a few minutes) I have terrible scars on my knees from falling due to passing out and hitting the ground hard. I have been to the hospital a few times for this, and in the span of 2 months hit 116 seizures.

I used to have a friend, lets call her Autumn, that I was childhood friends with. We have had many fights resulting in long breaks over the past 7 years, every time thinking I would not go back to her as I knew she wasnt an amazing friend to me, but as it is hard for me to make friends and i had a deep connection with her so i would do anything to make up for it.
I started noticing narcissistic *qualities* (not diagnosing obviously) in the past few years as people started pointing them out to me because i had a hard time seeing how i was being treated. For those 2 months of many seizures, i was walking on eggshells around Autumn.

She and another friend had purchased a watch for me to be able to monitor my seizures before they started getting very bad and it was given to me as a gift. Autumn was having some financial struggles and my boyfriend helped her out and gave her approximately half of what the watch had cost (evidently covering her half).

I had some really important games to my sister and I that i left at her place before our falling out. I asked a mutual friend to retrieve the games as Autumn scares me and once i had gone no contact my seizures stopped. I received a text recently from her saying im forcing the mutual friend to be the middleman and i should have asked for it back myself. In return for MY games i have to return the watch that was a gift and her part had been paid for by my boyfriend. I still need this watch as reading the text had made me pass out of a chair and convulse on the floor. I strongly believe Autumn is a major factor in my condition and any contact sends my stress to the point of seizures. 

My boyfriend is dealing with it now, i have blocked Autumn on everything. AITA for my beliefs of 1) the watch is mine and paid for through my boyfriend 2) i shouldnt be given an ultimatum to have my property returned 3) using other willing participants to contact her as i know its not healthy for me?

Theres a lot more, and two sides to every story but Autumn invokes massive fear in me that my brain can physically not handle. She easily distorts my reality and has a hold on me no other person ive met has.

62,1dm1521,AITA for checking in on my ex?,"
A year ago I was in a absolutely wonderful relationship and was thinking about proposing. Thats when I realized that for a few different reasons I am not going to live nearly as long as the woman I was thinking of proposing to. So after months of fighting with myself over what was right I made the decision to break up with her without really talking to her about it instead of proposing. I know that is an asshole thing to do and a mistake already but she didnt know I was planning to propose and my thought process is she was just going to say that it was fine without really thinking about it but we had also had many seemingly unrelated (to her) conversations where we talked about who we wanted to die first and her answer would always be something along the lines of, ""Me, I think I would just die if you were to die first."" Plus if I had told her why we were breaking up she would've been the only one who could've convinced me that it was fine and she'd be fine even though I know she wouldn't be when I am actually on my death bed. I also dont want her to waste half her life on me and then have to restart when I die, so I did what I thought was best. Which again I know it was a huge mistake not to talk to her about it.

Here is where the issue is though, after we broke up I have sent a couple ""I hope youre doing good"" texts on special days like christmas and her birthday. She has since told me she hated it and I have stopped but now I am questioning if I am a bad person for doing it in the first place. Like maybe if she knew the reason we had to break up it might be okay or it might not but since she doesnt I probably just remind her of when we broke up for seemingly no reason.

He was looking to arrange a new deal with a client and due the fact he was my brother I gave him some contacts that I knew would be able to help him out.
It was fine for couple of weeks until I received an email from one of these suppliers saying that it was my name down on the account they had set up and I was liable for the bill.
I immediately got a hold put onto the account until I could get to the bottom of this thinking is was just a mix up or honest mistake.
But when I brought this up with my brother and his business partner I got given some son story that they had been waiting for some money to come through and it would all be sorted and not worry they would fix it.
Now I didn't come down on the last shower so and since they wouldn't do it there and then I rang back up the supplier and kindly informed them I was nothing to do with this company and gave the details of both my brother and his business partner.
Me thinking this was the end of it went on my way only for my parents to call me and berate me saying how could I abondon the company I had set up with my brother and taken most of the money.
I told my parents what really happened and to say it snowballed would be and understatement.
Turns out he had signed my name on a few different contracts and was going to use me as a fall guy.it would have cost me 10s of thousands of it hadn't been caught.

66,1dlzxok,WIBTA if I stole a neglected dog?,"Tldr; old man does not take care of escape artist dog. I‚Äôm going to keep the dog next time I see him.

Last month, I (F, 49) took my dog out to piss. Well, as we're heading back to the house, as I round the corner, I see a pair of ghost white eyes staring at me from under the neighbors bushes. It was a BIG dog‚Ä¶ husky/german mix, young.

Who turned out to be super friendly, goofy, (un-neutered), and sweet. For clarity, we'll call my dog Neil and the stray Steve.

Steve was clean and soft with short nails, but he was SUPER skinny. I figured he had been running free for a few days and was not good at scavenging. No collar, just a choke chain. I put Neil back in the house and grabbed Steve and we headed to the emergency vet to have him scanned for a chip. (Steve is TOTALLY untrained as far as I can tell. 'Sit' gets nothing. Whatever, he's part Husky and they can be dumb.) Alas, no chip.

I took Steve home and posted the pics of him on Nextdoor and my community FB page and prepped some posters to hang up. I called animal control to see if he'd been reported missing. Called local vets to see if anyone recognized him. And we waited.

I got a lot of hits on social media that Steve was a known escape artist, and he usually just goes home. Finally, the next day, his owner reaches out. He says he misses his dog, and I get it. So, I return him. First thing that happens is the owner lets him in the house, keeps the door open, and Steve turns around and starts running up and down the block. The owner is totally nonplussed (the house is about 50 ft away from a 6-lane road). After 5 min, Steve runs back into the house. After a few more minutes of polite conversation, I am annoyed but it's not my dog, so I leave.

Come to find out later that day, the owner (a late middle age/older black man) keeps Steve tied to a tree in the back yard, and Steve always slips the lead and goes roaming.

¬†",Not the A-hole,2024-06-22,"WIBTA if I stole a neglected dog? Tldr; old man does not take care of escape artist dog. I‚Äôm going to keep the dog next time I see him.

Last month, I (F, 49) took my dog out to piss. Well, as we're heading back to the house, as I round the corner, I see a pair of ghost white eyes staring at me from under the neighbors bushes. It was a BIG dog‚Ä¶ husky/german mix, young.

Who turned out to be super friendly, goofy, (un-neutered), and sweet. For clarity, we'll call my dog Neil and the stray Steve.

Steve was clean and soft with short nails, but he was SUPER skinny. I figured he had been running free for a few days and was not good at scavenging. No collar, just a choke chain. I put Neil back in the house and grabbed Steve and we headed to the emergency vet to have him scanned for a chip. (Steve is TOTALLY untrained as far as I can tell. 'Sit' gets nothing. Whatever, he's part Husky and they can be dumb.) Alas, no chip.

I took Steve home and posted the pics of him on Nextdoor and my community FB page and prepped some posters to hang up. I called animal control to see if he'd been reported missing. Called local vets to see if anyone recognized him. And we waited.

I got a lot of hits on social media that Steve was a known escape artist, and he usually just goes home. Finally, the next day, his owner reaches out. He says he misses his dog, and I get it. So, I return him. First thing that happens is the owner lets him in the house, keeps the door open, and Steve turns around and starts running up and down the block. The owner is totally nonplussed (the house is about 50 ft away from a 6-lane road). After 5 min, Steve runs back into the house.

75,1dlz58o,AITA for not paying for my boyfriend‚Äôs Uber?,"My (25) boyfriend (24) owns a business and he has been stressed for the past couple of months as it has been difficult for him to make ends meet. He does get income on the side from investments etc but it is not enough to cover all his expenses. 

I understand all this and I‚Äôve tried to be supportive in the ways I can. As a result, I mostly cover my own meals and Ubers when I visit him about once a week (we live 30 minutes apart). I am a student and I still live at home. He also lives at home. I tutor on the side but the amount of spending money I have on hand is just over half the minimum wage in my country.

I try to be wise with my spending to maximise covering my travel costs, personal expenses as well as dates with my boyfriend. One of the ways I do this is by subscribing to an Uber subscription, which allows me to get 5% cashback on my rides and free delivery for food deliveries. 

My boyfriend has an outstanding amount on his app that he has been refusing to settle since January so he has asked to use mine and pay me whenever he wants to order food or send a package. I have agreed as I like being able to save him a little money on the delivery fees and promos. I have done this 23 times, and on occasion I‚Äôve paid for his food just because I want to do a nice gesture. He‚Äôs a fussy eater and I‚Äôve often had to call the store to make sure they‚Äôve removed the things he doesn‚Äôt like from his order. 

Today I was going to Uber to him and he asked if I could also order him an Uber to send a package to his business and I agreed as he would only be paying 2/3 of the original price. As I was about to order, he asked if I could pay for the Ubers and he could cover dinner instead. I wasn‚Äôt happy as I figured this should be a business expense of his and not a personal favour. But I was willing to do so anyway until I started filling out the collection details and he kept changing the pin location, which made the rate go up. I was frustrated and told him he should do it himself and I felt like he was starting to take advantage of my kindness. 

He apologised, said he‚Äôd sort out the Uber  and paid me back for the last food order I had covered for him, which I didn‚Äôt ask him to do. I felt bad because I like doing nice gestures for him but I feel like he pushes it too far. AITA for not just ordering the Uber and letting him cover dinner?

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-22,"AITA for not paying for my boyfriend‚Äôs Uber? My (25) boyfriend (24) owns a business and he has been stressed for the past couple of months as it has been difficult for him to make ends meet. He does get income on the side from investments etc but it is not enough to cover all his expenses. 

I understand all this and I‚Äôve tried to be supportive in the ways I can. As a result, I mostly cover my own meals and Ubers when I visit him about once a week (we live 30 minutes apart). I am a student and I still live at home. He also lives at home. I tutor on the side but the amount of spending money I have on hand is just over half the minimum wage in my country.

I try to be wise with my spending to maximise covering my travel costs, personal expenses as well as dates with my boyfriend. One of the ways I do this is by subscribing to an Uber subscription, which allows me to get 5% cashback on my rides and free delivery for food deliveries. 

My boyfriend has an outstanding amount on his app that he has been refusing to settle since January so he has asked to use mine and pay me whenever he wants to order food or send a package. I have agreed as I like being able to save him a little money on the delivery fees and promos. I have done this 23 times, and on occasion I‚Äôve paid for his food just because I want to do a nice gesture.

76,1dlz267,AITA FOR KICKING MY SISTER AND HER DAUGHTERS OUT OF MY APARTAMENT?,"My sister (31 years old) has a luxurious house under construction (it's not finished yet) and one day her partner (the father of her daughters) decided without warning to rent out the house they were living in, leaving my sister without a home. 
So my other sister offered her an apartment that she was about to rent out, but my sister rejected it because it was only for 15 days and she would get her house soon, so she and her boyfriend could look for another place. My other sister decided to proceed and rent the apartment to other people.
But in the end, they couldn't find a place to stay, so I offered her (again, because according to her it would only be for 15 days) the option to stay in my apartment with me but without her boyfriend (because he cheated on her recently and doesn‚Äôt financially support their daughters).
But my sister got mad at me, saying that if I did that, I would destroy her family and that she would never let me see my nieces again. For my peace of mind, I ended up agreeing because, according to her, it would only be 15 days.
Those 15 days have now turned into 4 months. My apartment, which was brand new, now has written-on walls and dirty sofas because she has small children. Additionally, she doesn't pay the full bills, which made me angry because we had agreed she would leave the apartment in the same condition. She refuses to repaint it (one day she says she will, the next she says she won't).
I told her I was tired of her and that she needed to leave the following week. Her boyfriend earns approximately $1500 a month (which might not be much in the USA, but it's a lot here), and he doesn't even pay for his daughters' food; he just spends it on alcohol. He doesn't help my sister with the bills or the maintenance of his own daughters.
I don't know if I'm being an idiot by telling her to sort it out on her own or if I'm just acting out of resentment for everything I've kept quiet about over the years.
At work, she wouldn't let me do anything and then got mad because I wasn't doing anything, but when I asked what I could do to help, she would say she preferred to do it herself. This happened countless times, going from not letting me work to treating me like a freeloader.
I particularly resent her because I once told her I wanted to study in another city at a public university and that I would get a job and the only extra expense would be rent. She said there was no money, which I understood, but a few weeks later, she paid rent for a house for herself and her boyfriend and started taking extra money for her house under construction (this money was taken from our joint business). 
I never told her how that made me feel; I just kept it to myself. Recently, I told her, and she just replied with, ""Well, cheers."" Since then, I can't see her the same way, and I don't know if I'm acting out of resentment or if I'm right.

77,1dlyyzb,AITA for no longer dealing with MIL behavior?,"I just realized that I let my daughter grow up in a toxic environment and never did anything about it. 
My MIL has never liked me. I have a chronic illness she has chosen not to understand, I do not have a full college education, and I only gave her 1 grandchild. That‚Äôs right. I was supposed to have more babies, because when she had cancer she had 4 kids and she thinks everyone should be able to do the same.

But the thing that bothers me the most, is that they also have chosen to have no relationship with my children. Why is it our fault that we don‚Äôt want this toxic person in our life anymore? Here‚Äôs a few things that she does- 

Could never tell her if child, or us, were sick or injured in anyway. Literally would hammer us w questions and place blame on us. 

If you weren‚Äôt grateful enough, for anything, she would belittle you or cry to make her the victim of it. 
Kept all gifts purchased for kids at her house. 

Constant talk of how big people are. Only explains people to you by how heavy they are. Tricks kids into eating certain foods. 

Child spent 3 weeks in hospital. Everyday she showed up she‚Äôd holler ‚Äúgrandma‚Äôs here‚Äù.  Never offered to feed my husband or I. Would only volunteer to spend night with kid alone. I have chronic pain. Would tell my husband I slept all the time while I was at hospital with child and praised him for doing more. 

Chose to never understand my chronic pain. Always turning my pain into something about her. If I didn‚Äôt show at a holiday, it was all about her. Said I should come anyway and go upstairs to rest. WTF? Leave my bed, get dressed etc.., to go somewhere to lay in a bed. 

Only did activities with kids that she likes. Baking, reading and art museums. Never fun science or history museum. Or movies or anything else. 

Told child her other grandmother died of cancer because she had smoked cigarettes. 

This is just a small list of the absurd shit I‚Äôve had to deal with for 30 years. Why does my husband and his brothers and wives not see this as toxic behavior?

78,1dlywty,WIBTA for ending a D&D campaign because friends refuse to communicate?,"So I (30M) my BF (34M), and two of my friends (M & F in their 30s) have played Dungeons and Dragons on and off again for several years now. We all enjoy playing, it's a great time to hang out with everyone. We're close friends, I've known them both since college, and my BF and I were groomsmen in their wedding.

What's getting me upset is that our friends, Andy and Rita, refuse to communicate their schedule to us in anything even resembling a timely manner. I am the DM for our group, so it's usually me that organizes everything. So I ask in advance for dates people might be able to play. To give you an idea of how long this has been a problem, about 4 years ago I started noticing that they'd have a lot of last-minute cancelations - times that they changed plans way before the scheduled date, then just forgot to tell us until the day of. So I started check about a day before we had a game scheduled whether they could. This seemed to work, but honestly they still just... don't answer texts? Like they might not respond for days, and I have to ask multiple times. Now the problem has gotten even worse.

Last night we had a tentative plan to play a game of D&D. Rita had a Doctor appointment related to her pregnancy, so depending on how that went, they could play. Day of, I ask Rita if she can update me when she learns whether they'll be coming over. She says sure, she will, she has the appointment later this afternoon. Around 6pm I haven't heard back so I text and ask how it went. She says good, babies (twins) are fine and everything's good. I reply ""That's great!"" and kind of hope she'd mention whether they will be coming. She never did, but it became clear when she said nothing more and they simply never showed up.

And to clarify I'm not saying I want them to play more or open their schedule up. I'm not obsessed with D&D. Well no, that's a lie and I definitely am. But not so obsessed that I think our game nights should come before anything and everything else in their lives. Honestly, I'm not even trying to go up in their priorities. Life's busy even without a pregnancy and this is just a game. But I'm just extremely frustrated that they don't seem to think we deserve to know whether they are ever going to show up until the last second. If this were any other kind of event, like a dinner we were hosting, this behavior would be absolutely unacceptable.

So now I don't want to play D&D with them anymore. And I'm planning to talk to them and say basically ""I understand life gets messy and there's a lot of stress these days. But the lack of communication you're providing is downright insulting at this point. So our campaign is over. I am not going to keep putting the effort into running a D&D game for you guys when you won't even tell us whether we'll play without me dragging answers out of you. We can maybe do regular board game nights if your schedules permit, but I will not be playing a TTRPG with you guys again.""

On Friday, a week yesterday, I had to go to my GP because my lymph nodes keep swelling in my face. They prescribed antibiotics but by the time I'd got home my jaw was locked. I called our non emergency number & they advised me to go to A&E which I did where I was admitted & discharged within twenty four hours.

Skip to Wednesday of last week. I woke up with a really sore throat, barely able to breathe & not being able to talk at all. I held out til eight figuring I could call my GP who told me to call the non emergency line again so I did. My aunt had to do the talking for me as I legitimately couldn't and kept choking on my own saliva & not being able to breathe. In the end, they sent an ambulance out where I found out my temperature was extremely high, I had a wheeze in my chest & my throat was swollen & inflamed. I was given two nebulizers on site, and taken to hospital where I was treated before being transferred to another hospital where they had an Ear, Nose & Throat department.

I was discharged later that day. 

Now, the only people that knew were my aunt & Mom. We didn't see the point in telling the rest of the family as they live over four hours away & I didn't want them to worry when I knew I was going to be fine. Since then, they have have been told but they're upset because I didn't tell them on the day. Truth was, I wasn't thinking clearly enough to tell anyone to be honest at the time, I'm still unwell, but nowhere near as bad as I was.

To ensure my fianc√©‚Äôs green card application goes forward as quickly as possible, we want to get married sometime in the summer.

I‚Äôve known my MOH since 5th grade and we were best friends all through school. I moved away for college and we drifted apart, but I‚Äôd see her every time I came home. 

The dress shopping trip was out of town so I paid for the 2 hotel rooms while we were there and I drove, my mom brought my MOH and a couple other bridesmaids a since they still live in my hometown.

Saying it was my wedding, and if I wanted a specific dress for them to wear I should pay for it, and that I didn‚Äôt pay for the bridesmaid dress when I was in her wedding (she got married at 18 and we wore old prom dresses we already had). My bridesmaid told her I was being pretty reasonable with my request and that she can get any dress she wanted in her budget.

The other day my wife asked for 1000 dollars for personal expenses and I immediately said yes This week we have been under a heat wave and work has been sporadic So today I did as many smaller jobs as I could in order to secure her extra money

91,1dlw9zw,AITAH for being jealous of my brother‚Äôs engagement and pregnancy? ,"I‚Äôm really close with my parents and older brother. Two years ago, my brother‚Äôs wife left him and it was a pretty tragic time as he was totally heartbroken. 

I was preparing to get engaged when we found out about the divorce, so I told my husband I wanted to wait for an engagement because I was thinking of my brother‚Äôs loss

A year later, I do get engaged! It‚Äôs a short engagement due to the extra wait we had. Simple marriage just immediate family. 1 month before my wedding I planned to go to my hometown and spend a ‚Äúlast weekend‚Äù with my mom to pick out wedding dresses 

While there, my brother introduced me to his girlfriend of less than 2 months. They told me they were engaged. I was shocked. I agreed not to say anything bc they hadn‚Äôt told my parents. 

A week later I find out her whole family knows and so do my brother‚Äôs friends. I‚Äôve already spent the week a complete wreck over this sudden engagement worrying myself sick and feeling guilt that my parents didn‚Äôt know. 

I went home again 2 weeks before my wedding to continue looking for a dress (the engagement news the previous visit threw me so much I was unable to get myself in the mood to wedding shop/plan)

At this visit they tell my parents they‚Äôre engaged (with my blessing‚ÄîI really didn‚Äôt want this hanging over my head any longer) 

Lots of comments at my wedding from my in-laws about how my brother is next etc. I brush everything off & thought I was okay with it

Two months after my wedding, I graduate. I‚Äôm 28. This is a big deal for me due to losing a large chunk of my early 20s (another story). I go home to celebrate, my parents have a cake and my dad grills

My brother and his fiance announce they‚Äôre 4 weeks pregnant. My parents already knew‚Äîbrother mentions the cake (that I thought was mine) is also for the baby/father‚Äôs day 

No one knew this, but my husband and I had started trying after the wedding. I lost a baby 2 years ago and it has been very difficult for me not to cry around babies/pregnant people. After they left, I cried so hard I physically couldn‚Äôt open my eyes the next morning 

At this point, I‚Äôm feeling like I don‚Äôt want to tell my family IF I do have big news in the future. Like if I go home and announce that I got a job, my future SIL will pop up and say they‚Äôre also adopting twins or something

I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and no one is understanding why I‚Äôm having this reaction. I feel I would have waited to announce, especially given them only being 4 weeks along. Like I could have had one weekend that was about my graduation since the marriage was already overshadowed? 

They even mentioned not wanting to steal my thunder every time I came home. But then they proceeded to steal it twice in a row. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that

Am I being a totally spoiled brat? I felt like this was my big year, I was turning my life around after 9 very, very difficult years

A year later, I do get engaged! It‚Äôs a short engagement due to the extra wait we had. Simple marriage just immediate family. 1 month before my wedding I planned to go to my hometown and spend a ‚Äúlast weekend‚Äù with my mom to pick out wedding dresses 

While there, my brother introduced me to his girlfriend of less than 2 months. They told me they were engaged. I was shocked. I agreed not to say anything bc they hadn‚Äôt told my parents. 

A week later I find out her whole family knows and so do my brother‚Äôs friends. I‚Äôve already spent the week a complete wreck over this sudden engagement worrying myself sick and feeling guilt that my parents didn‚Äôt know. 

I went home again 2 weeks before my wedding to continue looking for a dress (the engagement news the previous visit threw me so much I was unable to get myself in the mood to wedding shop/plan)

At this visit they tell my parents they‚Äôre engaged (with my blessing‚ÄîI really didn‚Äôt want this hanging over my head any longer) 

Lots of comments at my wedding from my in-laws about how my brother is next etc. I brush everything off & thought I was okay with it

Two months after my wedding, I graduate. I‚Äôm 28. This is a big deal for me due to losing a large chunk of my early 20s (another story). I go home to celebrate, my parents have a cake and my dad grills

My brother and his fiance announce they‚Äôre 4 weeks pregnant. My parents already knew‚Äîbrother mentions the cake (that I thought was mine) is also for the baby/father‚Äôs day 

No one knew this, but my husband and I had started trying after the wedding. I lost a baby 2 years ago and it has been very difficult for me not to cry around babies/pregnant people. After they left, I cried so hard I physically couldn‚Äôt open my eyes the next morning 

At this point, I‚Äôm feeling like I don‚Äôt want to tell my family IF I do have big news in the future. Like if I go home and announce that I got a job, my future SIL will pop up and say they‚Äôre also adopting twins or something

I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and no one is understanding why I‚Äôm having this reaction. I feel I would have waited to announce, especially given them only being 4 weeks along. Like I could have had one weekend that was about my graduation since the marriage was already overshadowed? 

They even mentioned not wanting to steal my thunder every time I came home. But then they proceeded to steal it twice in a row. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that

Am I being a totally spoiled brat? I felt like this was my big year, I was turning my life around after 9 very, very difficult years

Me (24F) and my family recently adopted two kittens a couple weeks ago. They are about 8-9 weeks old now and they are still a bit skittish and getting used to human interaction. They‚Äôve made a lot of progress but still don‚Äôt like to be held/picked up unless they‚Äôre super sleepy.

My mother has not gotten that memo and still will try grabbing them when they come close. What I do is sit on the floor with them and offer them treats and they usually come right over to get pets and stand on my crossed legs, so they‚Äôre obviously acclimating to me faster since I don‚Äôt scare them. Today, My grandmother was over and was happy to see the kittens. My mom picked up one presumably to let my grandma pet her easily, who was struggling and squirming to get free and obviously stressed out. I told my mom to just put her back down on the ground (she has scratched before trying to get down from being held, and my mom throws a hissy fit if she gets scratched). My mom then proceeds to tell me ‚ÄúDo NOT tell me what to do!‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôm like ??? Because she‚Äôs treating me like I‚Äôm a 12 year old.

94,1dlw2iv,AITA for telling my brother's wife we can't all have rich parents like her and her siblings?,"My brother Nicky (25m) is married to Liza (24f). They were at my parents house on Sunday for dinner and Liza really annoyed the crap out of me, something that isn't new, and I said something in anger and I might be TA for it maybe.

So Liza has a wealthy family. They paid for her and her siblings college expenses 100%. They paid for Nicky and Liza's house. They paid for their wedding. They're paying for one of their sons weddings this summer. They can afford all that. Liza has always been very... open, if trying to give her the benefit of the doubt, about it. She never hid the fact she came from money and was never shy about saying her parents pay for so much for her and her siblings.

Liza doesn't understand that we're not all that lucky. I'm 19f, work full time and I still live with my parents. We couldn't afford college. I didn't get the grades for a scholarship. Struggled enough through school that getting into massive debt for college when I could end up flunking seemed like a bad move for me. So I focus on working and I applied for a couple of training programs close to my parents house so I could try and do better without risking debt for nothing.

Liza looks down on me so hard for living with my parents still and for not going to college. Sunday she talked about how all her siblings attended college, how three of them are still in college, living there and doing just fine. How they'll be able to buy houses right out of college. How even she and my brother could do it. My parents said politely that not everyone can do all that. But then she talked about being 19 and not in college or living on my own and how I should really try so much harder. I snapped at that moment and I told her we can't all have rich parents who can afford to pay our ways through college, for our weddings and for our houses. I told her my parents didn't have that kind of money and neither did I, so we were doing our best in this shitty fucking economy. 

Liza told me I'm just lazy and making excuses and she stormed out. Nicky left a while after and he was pretty quiet. Liza used his phone to send me 30 texts three days later demanding I apologize and tearing me a new one for not doing it without being told and I know it was her because she texts in a very specific way.

The clothes were overheating, and thankfully I came home when I did. She and her son are both heavy sleepers, and wouldn‚Äôt have woken up from the smell. 

I sent her a message explaining that we‚Äôre both adults and that it‚Äôs not a conversation I need to have with her about fire safety, and the reply was ‚Äúsorry if the heater on worried you.

As the heading says, my roommate keeps leaving the heater on and leaving the house. The first couple times were presumably an accident, and one time I came home to it on and no one had been home for 6/7 hours. 

A few days later, I came home and could smell overheated fabric, only to discover that she was in bed for the night and she‚Äôd left the heater on with clothes on top of it. The clothes were overheating, and thankfully I came home when I did. She and her son are both heavy sleepers, and wouldn‚Äôt have woken up from the smell. 

I sent her a message explaining that we‚Äôre both adults and that it‚Äôs not a conversation I need to have with her about fire safety, and the reply was ‚Äúsorry if the heater on worried you. You know I‚Äôm a bit spacey‚Äù . She‚Äôs also made comments about how her ex was ‚Äúalso controlling about electricity usage‚Äù; so I think she thinks I‚Äôm trying to control her power usage, when it‚Äôs about fire safety. 

I came home tonight to the heater on and her gone, yet AGAIN. When I sent her a message asking if she was home, as the heater was on, she wrote, ‚ÄúI already told you I‚Äôd be gone an hour‚Äù. When she came home, I said, ‚Äúyou left the heater on again‚Äù. she put on her woe is me, ‚Äúhow could you be so mean?!‚Äù Face so I know this is just pointless trying to get through to her.

 At first i thought she was really nice and kind.After a month or so she completely changed she used to talk with her boyfriend daily on videocall with me in the background and would have regular fights with him, she got curtain for her side of the room cause she couldn't sleep with lights on. Mind you the light is a table lamp which doesn't even light up half of the room. I tried to tell her about the noises and she would oblige to it for 2 days and then the same things start again. In december, the cold was unbearable for me and we had our exam in few days. She started to tell me that she was felling hot and wants the fan on, i said ok but on a lower setting for which we had a fight. I tried to ignor it and continued living with her hoping she would understand. Few days later she accused me of ""ignoring"" her and all our friends have started to ignor her and took my side. Some of our friends came in and settled everything or i say they thought they did because after that i was really not intrested in living with her. She continued to keep the fan on full speed even when i politely asked her not to do so. She said if i was feeling cold i can layer up(which i was: a sweter, socks) she said you can wear a puffer jacket. So i suggested why don't you wear summer clothes to which she said it's uncomfortable for her. She would have her curtains down, and would be under her blanket and arguing to turn the fan in full speed. 
With alot of fights we reached feb-march where she started feeling hot even more i was okay with the fan but she needed a cooler i didnt say anything.

103,1dlrrin,AITA for making noise in my flat?,"I live in a 4 in a block and recently I‚Äôve been having issues with my downstairs neighbour texting me about noise. I often hear her boyfriend shouting profanities at football and video games, sometimes multiple times a week and sometimes late at night. She has made comments previously about people upstairs, ‚Äúas long as they‚Äôre not having sex in the room above her as she bought the flat with a 90 y/o above and she ain‚Äôt hearing people shagging‚Äù. We‚Äôve built up a pretty good rapport since moving in. However, two situations recently where she‚Äôs texted me:

Two weeks ago, I‚Äôd had people in for drinks through the night and when people left in the early hours, I had company and we had sex for a couple of hours. She texted me ‚Äúmate, what are you sawing?!‚Äù at 8am in response to hearing the headboard banging. This is the first time I‚Äôve had sex in my flat in the 6 months we‚Äôve both been living here and I feel it‚Äôs a bit excessive to text me the first time. I‚Äôve heard them having sex more than once and I‚Äôd just turn the tv on, go in another room or put earphones in.

Last night I got home after 1am having been at my friends. My friend then showed up at mine in her pjs, upset after an argument with her fiance who she‚Äôs marrying in 4 weeks and saying she‚Äôs leaving him. My spare room is situated above their bedroom, I made my bedroom the smallest room in the house so I wasn‚Äôt living directly above them. My friend was in the spare bed talking about what happened before going to sleep, she was talking in an emotive tone but she wasn‚Äôt by any means shouting. Within 10 mins my neighbour texted me saying I‚Äôd woken her up by coming home with my pals and could I keep the noise down, which again I feel was a bit unnecessary considering it‚Äôs only one female voice she would‚Äôve heard. I replied saying I came home alone and my friend showed up and explained the situation, but I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt need to explain to my neighbour when situations like this arise and there‚Äôs a bit of noise coming from my flat. This is just what you sign up to when you live in a four in a block flat, she rarely hears noise from my flat aside from people being in for drinks occasionally and I‚Äôve checked the noise levels with her. She could easily end up with a family living above, with crying babies waking her up through the night.

To add another layer, I messaged her a few days ago asking about our shared drying green and what she wants to do with it, as we are entitled to a half share each and whether she wants to use it communally or do half and half and she just ignored me. This was the second time I asked and she ignored me the first time too. Then she sends me these passive aggressive messages about noise. I wish I hadn‚Äôt gave her my number or built up such a friendly rapport.

Here is when I might be in the wrong. I had asked my mum to drive me in to work for my weekend job (for today) because I wasn‚Äôt comfortable driving when it was dark. The gist of the conversation that then turned in to an argument was that I was being ridiculous, that I was in the safest car to drive in, that it was a waste of money and petrol to drive me there and back (25mins to get there), that I had to get over it and grow up and that I need to be able to deal with it or I would never be able to live independently. I tried to explain to her my reasons for why( having an panic attack while driving, being distracted, there being more Roos around. all of these made a higher risk of have a accident and I just need till Monday when had my appointment with my therapist).  but we end up yelling at each and dad agreed with mum. Dad did say he would drive me and just sleep in the car for 6 hours (he is currently sick) I told him not to bother and if I have accident because of this I have one.

108,1dlq56d,AITA For not participating in activities on a vacation with my bf‚Äôs family,"I(21f) was on a trip with my bf's(23m) family. We live in Australia and we set off to go to Fiji. But before we fly to Fiji, we first had to fly to Sydney and stay there for a day.

Before we left for the airport my bf wanted to share my suitcase (and of course he told me the very last minute). Because of this he took out some of the stuff I packed including the only jacket I packed, as he kept arguing on why I'd need a jacket. And also prior his brother's gf was just recovering a cold. (What does this have to do with anything, well these are just small details to what I think kind of lead to it, could not idk)

We land in Sydney and it's pouring down rain. And even though it was summer at the time, the weather was definitely around 15 degrees C. And coming from Melbourne it's considered very cold for us. All I had were short sleeve shirts and shorts.

Next day we arrived in Fiji we slowly settled in, and stayed on a separate island from the mainland, meaning we were away from stores and that. We relaxed the first day, yet sooner or later I noticed my throat was starting to get a bit irritated. I thought it would just be a sore throat, luckily the gf had throat lozenges, so it'll be over quick. Oh was I wrong.

The next day I wake up with a full on fever. Not only was my throat sore. My nose was constantly dripping, I was coughing continuously, and I was nothing but nauseous. I didn't know if I had COVID or not, cause I didn't have access to any test. But PHYSICALLY I couldn't cope to do anything.

At first my boyfriend was feeling bad for me. I told him to not let me being sick get in the way of doing activities (like snorkeling or jet skiing, basket making etc). And soon my bf's mum eventually got sick and eventually so did his dad.

I would occasionally come out of our hut that we were staying in, to eat or just to socialise with his family cause I would get lonely. But I still felt so crap inside, and I'd feel so sad. My bf's family were very understanding through this as they were trying to get pharmaceuticals, to help me feel better.

After days of feeling miserable, there was one night, after dinner where the hosts wanted to play some games. And the games they were playing required alot of physical movement (running around mostly). Which although looked fun, I was too weak to participate. However my bf kept pushing me to do it, which I frustratedly had to explain many times that I can't. I didn't do it. I was watching my bf, his siblings, and other families play the games. I was happy cause it was fun to watch.

As the night was ending, and we went in our hut, my bf had a full on fit and was yelling at me on how I was ruining our vacation, saying I should be grateful that his family took me on their vacation, blaming me for sick and to just enjoy my first time out of the country.

109,1dlp7xv,AITA for not being grateful at a theme park even after my brother ‚Äúbought‚Äù the tickets?,"

Before I explain what exactly happened at the theme park, I will need to clarify some things, My brother and I (2 years apart.) have a strange relationship. He enjoys lecturing me on things, and tries to act more like my father then my brother. Which is strange, because sometimes I feel more mature then him. 
My brother decided it would be a good idea to help me get a job at a local creamery, and so he told me he‚Äôd take me to a theme park about 30 minutes away if I applied for it. We had actually been talking about this for some time before this, and he‚Äôs suggested bringing me before but it didn‚Äôt really happen until this past week. Now, I am not a fan of rollercoasters. I have an irrational fear of heights, (meaning words such as ‚Äòyou won‚Äôt get hurt‚Äô or ‚Äòit‚Äôs safe.‚Äô don‚Äôt really help, and that I can‚Äôt control the fear.) I find myself unable to breathe and feel panicked whenever high up. My brother knows this. However he still told me he‚Äôd make me ride every single ride. I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd try to take it seriously.
Honestly, the theme park was fun. I got to ride a lot of fun rides. But the issues started when we got closer to riding the first rollercoaster, I don‚Äôt trust those things no matter how hard I try. I think the first sign we were going to argue is when I nearly passed out on the coaster. It was an uncomfortable experience to say the least. When I expressed my concerns once we got off he made fun of me, joking around and saying ‚Äúoh no you blinked!‚Äù
I was still really kinda woozy after, and we sat down to get some water before going on another rollercoaster. After the second coaster he asks me ‚Äúdid you almost pass out this time?‚Äù Very sarcastically. That‚Äôs when I could be a bit of an asshole, I yelled at him to shut up. Then he got super upset and started getting at me, telling me that I had been making snarky comments all day and I have been ungrateful because he paid for my ticket and brought me here. 
I felt horrible at the time, and I was absolutely making snarky comments but I assumed it was all jokes and nothing to be seriously. I was an asshole, especially since he paid for my ticket. But nevertheless I felt embarrassed and went home to vent to my dad and my stepmom, telling them the whole story. They look confused and my stepmom said:

112,1dlo4mn,AITA for telling my sister I will never forgive her? ,"
 Let‚Äôs called her A. 

Last week, I went to pick up my kids from my mom‚Äôs after work. My sister A  was there and looked upset. I asked her what‚Äôs wrong she told me nothing and that she was on her way out with her child (N 2 year old) . I went to the kitchen to grab a bit and offered her some hoping she would tell me what she is upset about while we eat. She refused. I sat down to eat and she told me that some of the kids breath smell and that she would never come back to our moms. I asked her how did she smell the kids breath and if she or they were in each other‚Äôs faces. She didn‚Äôt answer the question but she made a face.

While still eating I noticed my 5 years old refusing to share a toy he had brought from home with her child. I told him sharing is caring and that he should share. My sister started laughing while looking at my visibly upset 5 years old. I told her this is not acceptable. 

She left shortly after with her child. I asked our mother what was wrong with A. Mom told me A came to drop her son off so she could go nap. Mom told her she couldn‚Äôt because she had enough kids at the moment and her son and my child don‚Äôt get along well. I shared with mom what A had said about the kids, mom‚Äôs response was that since A is pregnant and can‚Äôt stand certain smells she could have just left or went downstairs. Nothing about how the comment made not being okay okay. 

I left shortly. But the comment A made didn‚Äôt sit right with me. This isn‚Äôt the first time A has made comments about other people‚Äôs kids including strangers kids at playground and stuff. I texted A later that night telling her I am not okay with the comment she made and that she is allowed to provoke my child. To me it seemed like she was trying to provoke my child for not sharing with her so she can get a reaction out of him. She has done this a handful of times before and I have told her not to but the behavior still continues. She always does it when I am disciplining him. 
She blew off. A called my child a bully for not wanting to share with her child and for not wanting to play with him. She basically called me bad parent for having a child who didn‚Äôt want to share and old me to do better. Used lots of profanity. Called me delusional and narcissistic, etc. I was taken aback and hurt by what was said. I told her I would never forgive her. She told me she doesn‚Äôt need my forgiveness.

Today I got a call from our oldest sister B.  A called her and told her I said I was not going to forgive her for ‚Äúdisciplining my son‚Äù, this is a lie. B said I should discipline my son so that he doesn‚Äôt end up embarrassing me in public. And that I should give A a break because she is pregnant. And that I should apologize to A. She didn‚Äôt ask me for my side of the story. Nothing. I said okay to everything B said, not because I agree but because I was hurt and didn‚Äôt know what to say.

114,1dlo25g,AITA for flipping a person off?,"I (14 F) was out with my two friends who we'll call Jess and Beatrice last night. We had planned to go eat dinner and then get some dessert around town.

We first started by going to get dinner at this pizza place. While we were there, we were sat next to these 20-ish year old guys. They kept taking photos of us and we realized when one of them accidentally left their flash on. I am used to this sort of thing but my friends are not. Jess and Beatrice were both very nervous and once we finished our meals, we got out of there. 

To calm ourselves down, we went and got frozen yogurt. I use humor to cope with stress, so I began to joke while in line for the cashier about what they had been doing. A boy a few years younger than us stopped on his way to the register and said ''They weren't taking photos of you from under the table'' (keep in mind that he wasn't there??) and walked up to the other two he was paying with, who were about 17-18. I muttered ''Name one person who loves you other than your mother, I'll wait.'' I don't think he heard me, but my friends did and laughed, which he heard and got upset about.

When we left the place, they began to follow us, so I flipped them off. One of them yelled about how I was ''So effing funny"" before we ran down the alley into an area away from the stores around churches. We circled back to the original dinner place and went to eat in front of it. While we were sitting, the boys walked past us and into a group of people their age and began to talk about us (specifically me) right beside us. I told my friends we had to leave and used the loud cover up that I ""forgot something"". We walked about ten feet before booking it down the block.

We stayed in this crevice between buildings before we saw my father's car park across the street. We walked across the road and had to jump out of the way of a car that the two older boys were driving. I told my father I wanted to leave but understood that we had to wait for my friend's parents to arrive. The group of people had attempted to circle around to us once again but seeing my father they chose to not (considering he's a rather intimidating man).

Jess and Beatrice were both very nervous and once we finished our meals, we got out of there. 

To calm ourselves down, we went and got frozen yogurt. I use humor to cope with stress, so I began to joke while in line for the cashier about what they had been doing. A boy a few years younger than us stopped on his way to the register and said ''They weren't taking photos of you from under the table'' (keep in mind that he wasn't there??) and walked up to the other two he was paying with, who were about 17-18. I muttered ''Name one person who loves you other than your mother, I'll wait.'' I don't think he heard me, but my friends did and laughed, which he heard and got upset about.

When we left the place, they began to follow us, so I flipped them off. One of them yelled about how I was ''So effing funny"" before we ran down the alley into an area away from the stores around churches. We circled back to the original dinner place and went to eat in front of it. While we were sitting, the boys walked past us and into a group of people their age and began to talk about us (specifically me) right beside us. I told my friends we had to leave and used the loud cover up that I ""forgot something"". We walked about ten feet before booking it down the block.

We stayed in this crevice between buildings before we saw my father's car park across the street. We walked across the road and had to jump out of the way of a car that the two older boys were driving. I told my father I wanted to leave but understood that we had to wait for my friend's parents to arrive. The group of people had attempted to circle around to us once again but seeing my father they chose to not (considering he's a rather intimidating man). Eventually we all made it home, but my mother says me flipping them off was rude and uncivilized. So, AITA?",,0.06833501160144806,0,0
115,1dlnwg9,AITA: Not lending my sister 5k for her masters program?,"My mother passed away several years ago and left me (29f) the house we lived in together. This house I moved into with her when she got the mortgage and always paid half the mortgage as well as paying half of the down payment. It was our plan for me and my future family to live with her in that house as a multi-generational household. 2 years after moving into the house mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer (she passed 2 years later) and made a will leaving my older sister (31f) a car (which she took possession of and totaled before mom passed). During the pandemic due to issues with the mortgage company accepting the probate paperwork I had to sell the house, for just a little more than the mortgage amount. A year and a half after selling the house my sister called and asked me to borrow 5k to pay for her masters program for the semester because there was an issue with the financial aid from the department of education. I told her I couldn't lend her that much money (I've lent her smaller amounts to help pay her rent over the last couple of months, even though it meant I'd have to pay a late fee on my rent, so she wouldn't be evicted) because after 2 moves (our first new home flooded), emergency root canal surgery, and having to replace our car, there isn't that much left and started trying to help her find other ideas. She refused to listen to me and got hostile saying that I could help if I'd wanted to and was lying about having the money.

116,1dlnqnc,AITA for not wanting to help my mother. ,"So I‚Äôm 20 F. My mom is 40. I have 2 sisters, growing up I was the one who knew the most sign language and had to interpret for my sisters and the whole world for my mom. It definitely was hard. Due to my mom not wanting to work we were on government assistance on our whole life. I have an amazing grandma ( my moms mom) who help pay for everything else we need, not that it‚Äôs important but my grandma took us on a family vacation every year when we were younger. My grandma bought my mom a car ( multiple times) and bailed my mom out of trouble so many times. We were also heavily involved with CPS. My grandma would make sure that my mom never lost custody of us.

Now I moved away to college when I was 18. It‚Äôs about 2 hours away from home, my mom decided to get a new boyfriend and girlfriend. I‚Äôm not sure how old her boyfriend was but i do know that the girlfriend was 18 ( the same age as me). She moved them into the house where my two younger sisters were staying( at the time 16F and 12F) . This caused a lot of issues! My mother than decided that she wanted to move to NYC and not take her two children that were still living with her( we live in texas). So my sisters moved in with my grandma, while my mom moved to NYC. My grandma was not happy about it but she also didn‚Äôt want my sister to go into the system. My mom started doing hard drugs while she was up there.She finally broke up with that guy , moved back to texas and my grandma helped her get an apartment.

So now today times, my grandma wants my mom to pay rent for the apartment that my grandma had to pull out in her name( due to my mom being kicked out of serval apartments) . My mom doesn‚Äôt want to and it‚Äôs causing a huge fight . Also another thing is that my mom currently lives about a 5 minute drive from my grandma house where my 2 sisters live. She never see them and never try to talk to them. This year for mother‚Äôs day i took my youngest sister shopping for mother‚Äôs day. I asked her if she want to get anything for our mother and she was like no i don‚Äôt want to get her anything. It makes me feel really bad because I am the only one of her children who will talk to her.

So now for my question‚Ä¶I have always felt that I would have to take care of my mother whenever I am older( mind you, she is just deaf there is nothing else wrong with her). Except now I am older and I want nothing to do with her, I don‚Äôt want to talk to her and I definitely don‚Äôt want to help her . What should I do?

Over the last few months her condition deteriorated swiftly.  She began exhibiting more behaviors.  She had wounds that wouldn't heal, a part of the illness and was forced into the hospital which further deteriorated her overall condition. The more demanding her needs the less I was able to work.  I ended up being quite late, though still within the month for April, May, and now June.  
My mom passed kind of unexpectedly early on the morning of June 14th, as I was changing her bedding.  

I'm an only child of a single parent so it was just the two of us. No one to help out.  I had to pay for all of the costs around her cremation by myself. Instead of making a payment on the $4500 monthly rent I paid so my mom wasn't in storage indefinitely and her remains could come home with me.

My landlord texted me that he couldn't keep carrying me after less than a week, that he needed my rent to pay the mortgage, insurance and his other obligations, that if I needed to downsize he needed to know immediately. 

 My landlord told me his mom bought him the house the first day I viewed it.  He makes me carry two renter's insurance policies. He also subdivided the property and the garage is occupied by two therapists, who see clients/patients. It doesn't afford a lot of privacy. I worry about crying too loud but my only clear memories of my mom are here, at least right now.  

I don't feel he's being fair. I don't think it's fair to blame me for his bills.

123,1dln3ac,AITA for dropping out of a trip to Europe at the last minute due to My Dad's actions over the past few weeks,"For me to explain this mess I got myself in, you'll need some backstory. To start I'm a 16-year-old guy that would have gone on a trip to Europe, with my dad and his family.   
  
My Dad to be frank is an asshole with a short fuse that can go off easily, my relationship with him is rocky at best. However, he wasn't paying for the trip as it was my stepmom who was paying for the trip that they planned for my senior year in high school but were off by a year. 

 A few weeks before my flight to see him, he called me and we talked about a few things going on in my life which was normal.

A few days, I got called by my mom that morning asking me to check my bank account as my dad had called her, yelling at her about how I'd bought liquor with my card, calling her a bitch in doing so my other mom argued with them. I didn't buy the liquor, as someone else in the family was using my card.    
  
In doing so my mom notified my step-mom to which she that Dad would be on his best behavior during the trip. So I took her word for it. The next My Dad called me directly to talk about some stuff as well as to 'apologize' for what he said but his apology was him saying ""Sorry if I made you think I said this and that' and giving a bullshit excuse.  
  
A few weeks later, and told one of my moms about me not wanting to attend the trip. She told my other mom, who told my dad that I wasn't going. However, they had to leave for something, but when they got back they wanted to know what I told my dad during the first phone call had with him this month. He told my mom that I said I was not feeling safe around my other mother and other hurtful stuff. In doing so my mom even called him and as he said what he said, I was gonna start an argument with him but was told to hang up. In doing so both moms were not gonna let me on the trip due to this.

 However, it wasn't paying for this as my step-mom was not happy about this last-minute mishap, stating that I should have told her from the start instead of 'toying with her and my other siblings' as I heard from my father.

124,1dln0sb,AITA for making a comment about my sister‚Äôs baby?," To start I‚Äôm a 16F with three other sisters. My family had a lot of drama with my oldest sister who we‚Äôll call Mary. To keep it short she had to be institutionalized, CPS calls/visits about her, etc. Most of this did happen when I was younger and I‚Äôm prone to blocking trauma out so there was definitely more that happened. 

 Mary moved states a few years ago with her girlfriend and hasn‚Äôt reached out to me or my sisters since. We don‚Äôt even speak when she facetimes my mom and I happen to be in the room. 

 To my knowledge, her girlfriend‚Äôs family situation has a lot going on. (I don‚Äôt want to give out too many details) But she had a baby and wasn‚Äôt fit to take care of it. Since they moved in with Mary‚Äôs girlfriend's sister, they noticed it too and wanted to take custody of the baby. I don‚Äôt think anything legal happened, mostly because of costs and the mother didn‚Äôt want to fully lose custody but knew they would take better care of the baby. 

 Now, my mom has a blabbermouth. She tells my sisters and I about what‚Äôs going on in Mary‚Äôs life all the time, even though I think if Mary wanted to tell us something she should do it herself, but nonetheless I listen. 

 Here‚Äôs my problem. My whole family was sitting outside together and my mom made the comment, I forgot the reason/whole sentence, ‚ÄúYour grandkid‚Äù to my Dad. He immediately denied how that was his grandkid and made comments about how the baby wasn‚Äôt related to him. This upset my mom but I felt the same way. I said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYeah, I wouldn‚Äôt call the baby my nephew.‚Äù 

 It might be important to add that Mary is my half-sister. My mom married my dad when she was about 5-6. I think the reason my mom got upset was because she took it as how Mary and my dad weren‚Äôt blood-related. But I see it more as them just taking care of a baby, it‚Äôs not like this was an adoption or fostering a child they wanted to have forever. My sisters also agreed and said they weren‚Äôt going to tell anyone they had a nephew. 

 After this conversation, my mom must have called Mary and told her because my sisters and I got a group text from Mary about how what we said was insensitive and that if we had any children she would consider them her own and not make such comments. (There was more to the texts but nothing really important) 

 I truly don‚Äôt think I said anything wrong. Which is why I didn‚Äôt respond, and let my two older sisters do the talking. Mary had concluded that we don‚Äôt care about her or her girlfriend, and that we were all a bunch of assholes. 

 I know some might think we don‚Äôt like Mary or have a hidden problem with her for everything in the past, I can‚Äôt speak for my sisters, but I don‚Äôt have any animosity or hatred for her.

Recently, her husband was sued for a debt. I went over what she was sent, and saw that it had been filed outside the statute of limitations. She asked if I could help her with it, because they do not speak English as a first language. I‚Äôm not an attorney, but I‚Äôm headed to law school, and I‚Äôm friends with attorneys that can help with advice, so I said I would. I sent the information to a lawyer friend, not knowing that she was in court for several days and it took her a few days to respond. 

In the meantime, I double checked the civil code and typed up what I could. 

Now, at this time, I was also dealing with a sick child, I‚Äôm taking a summer class, and as soon as my son was feeling better, it was time for us to head out for vacation. 

I worked on what she needed on the plane, and waited one more day for my lawyer friend to look it over. All this time, I was working to make sure I had it to her on Thursday at the latest, because the deadline to file was Friday. 

I was in a bad service area, but I was able to take a picture of what I typed and send it Tuesday night. She asked me to type it, and I did, but because of the poor service, it did not send until Wednesday afternoon, when I sent it in the morning. 

She went off at me today and said that ‚Äúwhenever I have an emergency, she helps me‚Äù and that ‚Äúnow she sees how little she means to me.‚Äù 

I feel like this was really unfair, because I spent a *lot* of time on it for her, and the only reason it took so long, was because I wanted a lawyer to look at it to make sure that I did it right. I was also helping her with this, despite dealing with a sick kid, school, and also being on vacation.

I guess I also feel taken advantage of, because I told the lawyer friend how it went, and she said that if they‚Äôd hired an actual attorney, they‚Äôd be out for more than he owes.

129,1dlmcxu,AITA for blowing up at someone when he said i would neglect my dogs ,"I (17F) have two dogs, My mom adopted a male Yorkie after my cat passed and just recently a female Rottweiler. I‚Äôve never been super keen on dogs, they just require a lot of energy I don‚Äôt have. 

I vent to some of my friends about how they run me up the wall. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt mind them, but they‚Äôre both puppies and not  trained super well yet and Sometimes I get overwhelmed. Another person, I don‚Äôt really count as a friend, said I talk about my dogs as if they‚Äôre a nuisance than a pet when vent.

 I never really cared because he never seemed to understand my jokes sarcasm or anything like that, but this time he really pissed me off.
There‚Äôs a heat wave in the northeast rn which means all of us are staying inside. My mom had to go to florida which left me and my brother with the dogs. my brother left to do whatever he does and I was left alone. 

To keep it short, my Rottweiler pooped in her cage and bite me really hard and my yorkie kept picking fights with her (we‚Äôre working on that) I get overstimulated really fast so when this happened I kinda just cried and cleaned up the shit.

When I told my friends about this they totally understood me.

I‚Äôve never been super keen on dogs, they just require a lot of energy I don‚Äôt have. 

I vent to some of my friends about how they run me up the wall. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt mind them, but they‚Äôre both puppies and not  trained super well yet and Sometimes I get overwhelmed. Another person, I don‚Äôt really count as a friend, said I talk about my dogs as if they‚Äôre a nuisance than a pet when vent.

 I never really cared because he never seemed to understand my jokes sarcasm or anything like that, but this time he really pissed me off.
There‚Äôs a heat wave in the northeast rn which means all of us are staying inside. My mom had to go to florida which left me and my brother with the dogs. my brother left to do whatever he does and I was left alone. 

To keep it short, my Rottweiler pooped in her cage and bite me really hard and my yorkie kept picking fights with her (we‚Äôre working on that) I get overstimulated really fast so when this happened I kinda just cried and cleaned up the shit.

When I told my friends about this they totally understood me.

131,1dllfso,AITA for scheduling my wedding before my brother‚Äôs?,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some outside perspective here because my family is pretty mad about this.

Background: my brother, Alan, got engaged about a year ago, they still have not set a date or even decided on much of anything. I proposed to my fiancee last month. My brother is older than me.

The situation: my brother, soon to be SIL and mom are very upset with me because fiancee and I have just set our wedding date. My brother had mentioned the potential of Fall 2025 but nothing was set at all. My fiancee and I found a great venue and set our date for Spring of 2025.

We don‚Äôt want a lengthy engagement so we will have roughly a year to plan. We have also been saving for a house for a couple years, and are on track to meet our goal in late 2025. I should also mention that my fiancee would much prefer to be married before we buy a house.

To us, spring sounded great! It‚Äôs near our anniversary, it‚Äôs a whole season apart from the fall wedding my brother wants, and it satisfies our want to be married before buying a house later that year.

When I told my brother, he seemed ok, but soon I got a flurry of texts from family accusing me and my fiancee of stealing my brothers thunder and breaking etiquette.

My feeling is that they have had a year of being engaged to set a date, and they haven‚Äôt, so why do I have to hold up our plans?
