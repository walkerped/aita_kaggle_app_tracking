0,1dmqnxi,WIBTA if I set rules and boundaries around my birth?,"I (24f) am a ftm with a baby due in the next month. Baby will be the first grandchild on my side and second on my husbands side. We’re all very excited to meet the little wiggle worm and just ready to have baby home.
  Both sides of the family live at least 6+ hours away from where we currently live. My mom has requested that I call her the second I go into labor so she and my dad can drive the 6 hours to come see us and meet the baby. I want to state I love my parents to pieces, but sometimes they’re a bit overbearing. They plan on staying at my house for a week after I go into labor. I know my mom intends on helping with cleaning and cooking and housework, so I’m not AS apprehensive of them coming. I just know it will be overwhelming.
  Husband’s mother lives farther away from my parents and plans to fly in. I have been warned that she most likely will do nothing other than hold the baby. Her flight is scheduled for the end of next month, so there should be no overlap between sets of parents. 
  Here’s where I may be the AH. I have considered not telling my parents about my labor until AFTER baby is born and we’re home and settled, which will upset them. I had also considered setting rules where I will NOT be catering and hosting family and guests like usual; which is most likely what his mother will expect. Sister says I’ll be the AH since my mom is excited for the baby and I’d be depriving her the experience. She also thinks I should be able to let both sets of grandparents bond with the baby. Husband says do whatever I feel necessary since I’m planning a natural birth and I’ll be in pain.

1,1dmklme,AITA for wanting my partner to apologise?,"Me (15FTM) and my partner (17MTF) have been dating for a year. She and I have got along well and we even introduced each other to some things like game and show franchises that we really liked a lot. Overall, our relationship was going great. Until some major arguments started happening.



These arguments began in July when a friend of ours was in a low mood.



However this month…some bad things have happened.



I was wanting to play a game with our friend that I found really interesting because of a video I had watched. He said he’ll think about it since he’s picky about trying new games (and I know that’s not the case since me, him and my gf had played various discord games right off the bat without any “I’ll think about it”s). When I was patiently waiting for him to give me an actual answer on wether or not he wanted to play the game, my gf mentioned something about wanting to play Minecraft, aka a game my computer refuses to let me play on due to issues I can’t even fix. Even though he said he was ”Still thinking about it” he said yes. This made me annoyed beyond belief.



Whenever it comes to her and him playing Minecraft, they play it for the rest of the call unlike other games where they play them for only a short amount of time. This was where things started getting bad.  I can’t remember what else had happened yesterday but I did say something among the lines of “I want a girlfriend, not a bully”. This made her yell at me. She kept on saying that she wasn’t being a bully because of the fact that she helped me with coming out as Trans and so on so forth to. She asked me something and then said “Are you too much of a wuss to answer?”. This made me even more upset to the point where I physically didn’t want to speak. Eventually, it got me to tell her something that I was brutally honest about: Her not apologising after these kinds of things. I was hoping that she would realise her mistake but I was being wishful and it ended up with her excusing her actions. She told me that she can’t control these things and that she wasn’t in the wrong. I believe that in order for a relationship to stay healthy, both parties should apologise. She then started jumping to conclusions like thinking that I didn’t want her on Minecraft anymore, which wasn’t the case. She didn’t even let me tell her what I wanted, she just immediately thought that I was forcing her to stay off of Minecraft. The only way how I could’ve prevented things to get worse was to force myself to say things like “Can we forget this ever happened?” since I know that no matter what, she’ll never see her true mistakes in this relationship. Everything went on as normal afterwards.

2,1dmgquv,AITA for refusing to change the baptism date because of God Mother's concert? ,"I’m a FTM (f26) and when I announced my pregnancy to my bestfriend of 24 years in Aug 2023 (F25) I asked her to be my babies GM. Of course she accepted. 
Baby was born in March 2024 and in April I began telling her I was planning Baby’s baptism in October. She told me “plan it and I’II be there”.

 I had to fill out online forms, confirm her information, wait for the administrator to get back to me, then for several weeks frustratingly playing phone tag with the Priest to arrange a meeting and discuss the logistics of the baptism. 

I updated her throughout the process and she reassured me several times she would be there. Finally got to set a meeting in June and I let her know right away the date I picked in October. She said great initially and started planning her and her BF to come down.

 A few days later she sends me a message saying that she has a problem and that the date I chose was the date of a concert she got tickets her BF got her for Christmas.

DH and I had already sent out invites and got RSVPs from his family and mine. We also cant change the date as we have a hectic schedule which is why we needed it to be in October to begin with.

 I really wish she had told me about the concert date ahead of time and this whole thing could have been avoided. To me this is a life event that only happens once. It’s supposed to be an honor and there is a part of me that’s really frustrated at her.

The performer Is someone she’s only started liking for a few years, they are likely to go on tour again, and the tickets were relatively cheap. I would understand if this had been someone she loved for life and I think it would be so important she would have told me the dates the second I mentioned October.

She technically could do both but she has come up with a lot of excuses. There is a 7.5hr difference between the events and although she would have a 5hr drive home I was hoping she would consider it since it was her mistake.

 Nope. She claims she won’t do that since her BF  is upset about the date and will be in too terrible of a mood to go to the concert with her. He won’t let her drive alone and she won’t take a train since it will cause her to miss the concert. 

 Long story short I have to message her back after she told me she won’t be coming on the day I planned. If I want her there l would have to pick a different day. Preferably not Holy Sunday since Saturdays work better for her so she won’t be tired at work on Monday.

 I’m sleep deprived and recently dianosed with PPD and don’t want to react harshly based off my raging hormones. She knows how much this means to me as I lost my dad really young and religion has been a huge part of my healing process so I have a lot of emotion when it comes to this.

4,1dmb7l6,AITA for allowing my bf to spend the night even though it makes my sister uncomfortable?,"Due to tough circumstances, my sister and I, both in our 30s, moved back in with our parents, into our old bedrooms. Before this, my boyfriend and I lived together and have been dating for almost two years. My boyfriend occasionally stays over, about 2-3 nights a week, since he now lives an hour away. When he was staying overnight and I left for work, I’d let him sleep in, he’d take my dog out in the morning and then leaves for his place.

Recently, my sister told me she felt uncomfortable with him staying over, especially when I leave early for work. I took issue with this for several reasons:

	1.	He doesn’t bother anyone and has always been respectful.
	2.	Our parents didn’t mind until my sister brought it up.
	3.	My sister’s ex boyfriend at one time lived with us for a period, which didn’t bother me. (She’s single now)
	4.	Our brother previously stayed with us and his fiancée visited and stayed over without issue.

When I asked my sister for a specific reason, she couldn’t provide one other than her discomfort. After our conversation, she tried to convince our dad to prohibit him from coming over simply because she didn’t want my bf at the house. Dad didn’t agree to doing that. So then she insisted to our parents that my boyfriend should not stay overnight.   My dad eventually said my boyfriend couldn’t stay upstairs. Eventually, after my sister kept complaining and wearing our dad down, my bf wasn’t allowed to spend the night. One night, my boyfriend and I fell asleep on the couch, and she tattled to my dad. Another time, she called dad at work because I left my boyfriend at the house in the morning.

I don’t understand why my sister is so concerned about my relationship. It’s unfair that she and our brother could have their significant others stay over, but she objects to mine. He doesn’t touch our food, or make himself at home; he stays in my room, out of the way. I’m well aware that it is my parents’ home, and if I don’t want to accept the double standards my sister is wanting them to have, I should move out. She could do the same if she’s bothered by my happiness. Why is she so involved in my business? She seems to be hyper focused on my situation and controlling the outcome of that. I don’t get it.

I have made these for us many times. It is a simple process. You take the pizza stone and put it in the oven let the oven preheat. Put the pizza on the paddle and slide it onto the hot stone. Once it's ready you slide the paddle under the pizza and pull it out. Put it on the carving board and cut it. 

Easy right? 

Nope. 

My pizza stone was dirty, it is scorched not dirty, so her brilliant idea was to make the pizza on my plastic cutting board. 

Because that way she could just take the cutting board out with oven mitts and cut the pizza without having to use all the tools. 

I got home to see black smoke coming out of my house and my girlfriend on the phone with 911. 

My dog is not on his leash and he's going crazy. 

I go to the front door to see if it's hot in the house or if I can see flames.  

No flames, no heat. I get to the stove and turn it off. I open the sliding door to let out more smoke and get my leash on the way out. 

The firefighters are there within five minutes and the smoke is already dissipating. They go in to make sure. 

All clear. 

Thank god they were there less than an hour. It is covered by the city. If it was over an hour I would have been charged for the response. 

My oven is fucked though. And I have a lot of smoke damage to clean up. 

I told my girlfriend I was glad she was okay but that she is a dumbass and she wasn't allowed in my house alone for a while. I took her key away.  We do not live together. But she has roommates and likes having a big house to herself on her days off. 

She says that it's a mistake anyone could make and that I'm an asshole for calling her names. Yes she said those words.

Today we were at a family get together. We have a 3 year old and I am 20 weeks pregnant. It was a very eventful day-swimming, grilling, bounce house for the kids, and typical social interaction. It was a rough day for me because I’m already quite big and in a lot of pain on top of being exhausted from pregnancy. We are also struggling with potty training. I took the brunt of parenting because my husband was grilling but he did handle most of the pool time responsibilities. I had to lock myself away multiple times throughout the day to cry from being overstimulated and exhausted.

My husband has really bad anxiety surrounding germs and he accidentally drank from someone else’s drink while we were there and he was really struggling-thinking he was going to get sick or in his words “he drank after someone who has an STD”. As far as I know, no one in my family has an STD and he knows that thought is coming from nowhere. He was texting me about it while we were there and I wasn’t really responding because I was so tired and also trying to clean up after my kid so we could go home. He asked me when we got home if I saw his texts and I told him “I did but I didn’t really have the mental capacity to handle that.” I apologized and it was sincere and he just kinda sighed and we preceded getting our kid to bed.

He is in the shower now and doesn’t seem upset about it, but I feel so torn about me saying that. One one hand, I feel like I’m setting a boundary and advocating for my needs (something I’ve been working on in therapy) but in the other hand I feel it’s my job as his spouse and partner to be there for him and support him.

My parents had 5 kids two boys then they tried for a girl but ended up with triplet boys that they didn’t want instead.they told us this “jokingly” every  chance they got but I think it was true.I lost my brothers when we were 16 .they died in a car accident due to our uncle being intoxicated 

About two months later I got home from school to my parents in the backyard  burning  all of our pictures and baby stuff. They had completely cleared out  our room leaving only my things. I was only able to salvage one baby photo (I dont know who) and parts of baby blankets. I still don’t know what they did with their ashes.I probably cried as hard as the day they died.
The reasoning I was given was that my mother needed to let go of everything to move on .My older  Brothers fully supported this.the crazy part is she still kept up photos of her brother who was the cause of everything. Which led to me shutting down I hardly ever spent time with them from then on.
 
My parents and oldest brother continued on with life like everything was fine they didn’t miss them and would never talk about them. Only my second oldest brother would reminisce with me sometimes but as time went on even he seemed to forget them.my extended family also got rid of any pictures and refused to talk about my brothers in fear that my mother would get upset . It was all in the interest of her mental health but no one cared about mine.

Then when I was graduating at 18 my best friend asked if I  didn’t want to submit any photos of my brothers for my senior page in our year book  since they were given in memory blocks in the book since we attended a k-12 school and all the teachers knew them.after telling her what had happened she apparently got our entire class and the av class to dig through years of video and photos from school events gathering everything they could find with us in it.which they gave me at our pre graduation party . I never shared this with my family. I moved out the day after graduation and have barely spoken to them since.
  
My oldest brother passed away two months ago. I didn’t attend the funeral or reach out to my parents then earlier this week my parents showed up at my door . Demanding that I give them the photos and videos that I have of my brothers. 

My mother was sobbing on my couch about how sorry she was and that we could go to therapy. My father seemed just as remorseful saying  that my oldest brother’s death hit them hard and they want a better relationship with the last two kids they have.I felt nothing for them I told them no and that I would like for them to leave.I don’t know who told them about the photos but my phone has been blowing up ever since with random people berating me for treating my grief stricken parents so awfuly so am I the asshole here?

8,1dmapq0,AITA for ditching my friend on prom night?,"School dances have never been my thing, so I spent a long time debating whether I wanted to go to my senior prom. I ultimately decided to go because my boyfriend is homeschooled and I can tell he feels like he's missing out on having a normal high school experience, so I figured taking him to prom would be a nice gesture. Unfortunately, I didn't make up my mind until two weeks before prom, which meant we didn't have a lot of time to make plans.

I knew my best friend was already planning to go to prom with some of her other friends, so the next week at school, I asked if my boyfriend and I could tag along with her group. She said it was fine.

A couple days later, my boyfriend started asking me about dinner plans. When I asked my friend about it, I found out that she didn't have any plans for dinner, or dessert, or anything at all. I asked her if she had any food preferences, and she said she didn't care where we went. Then I asked the other girls in her group where they wanted to go, and they didn't have any ideas either. Finally, I asked my boyfriend where he wanted to go, and he too had no ideas. So I decided to bite the bullet and pick the place myself. 

There was also the issue of transportation. My mom offered to drive us to the restaurant, and then the dance afterward, but said that everyone needed to find their own transportation to our house first so that she didn't have to drive around and pick everyone up.

The day before the dance, my friend approached me and told me she wanted to coordinate outfit colors and that we were all going to wear black. I said that wouldn't be possible because the dress I had chosen was blue. She asked if she could see a picture, and when I showed her the one I said, she held back a laugh and said, ""You seriously want to wear a Walmart dress?"" I told her that I liked the dress just fine, and besides, my boyfriend had already picked out a matching tux. Then she said she didn't think it was fair that I wasn't giving her any input, and I told her that I would've appreciated her input if she had given earlier when I expressly asked for it. Since her phone was broken and I couldn't contact her via text, I told her that I would email her the schedule. 

I sent the email first thing the next morning, and explained that she needed to be at my house around 5:30. She didn't respond, so I tried texting the other girls in our group, but they didn't respond either. Finally, I tried calling her mom, but got no response. Throughout the day, I tried several more times to contact her, but I was met with radio silence. When 5:30 rolled around, I still hadn't heard anything from anyone other than my boyfriend. Not wanting to miss out on prom night, I finally decided to just ditch the rest of the group and take my boyfriend to dinner.

My friend made it to the dance on her own, but she was upset that I left her behind.

9,1dmaplr,"AITA, for trying to make new friends after constantly being left out?","
I, an 18-year-old female, joined a theatre class in high school. I had one friend in that class, which led to making more friends. However, no matter how much I tried to talk to my other ""friends,"" they would barely respond to me. They even made plans right in front of me without including me. So, I gave up trying to talk to them altogether and focused on my one friend, whom I had been friends with since the beginning of the year.

Unfortunately, my friend had to switch to virtual classes due to health reasons, leaving me with nobody to talk to in the theatre class. When I tried to engage with my ""friend group,"" they constantly made fun of me and talked behind my back. One day in April, the day before one of our play's opening nights, I decided to try talking to other people in the class. I ended up making really good friends with three other people, and we became very close after the show ended.

Everything was going well for the next few weeks until one day, one of my old ""friends"" started talking to me again. He expressed concern about me and claimed he was trying to save me from my new friends. I didn't respond at that moment because it was during a passing period, but it made me wonder why he even cared who I hung out with.

After that, not much happened until the last day of school. When I checked my phone, I noticed that a friend from another class had unfollowed me on everything and stopped talking to me altogether. Curious, I asked another friend from that class why this had happened. She told me that the friend who unfollowed me didn’t want to deal with one of my other friends, which made no sense because I had never talked about my other friends to her.

I found out that one of my ""old friends"" had spread a rumor saying that another friend had groomed one of my friends and had advised her not to talk to me at all. This ""friend"" is known for talking trash and spreading rumors about everyone she meets. When I confronted her, she said that she and my ""old friends"" felt hurt that I didn't want to hang out with them and called me a bitch.

10,1dma8pu,AITA because I feel my mom didn’t react strongly enough to my cancer scare?,"Hello! I (21F) discovered a lump in my breast October ‘23. This was investigated and deemed benign through aspiration. Although the lump deflated initially, it returned bigger and feeling different. I got another ultrasound and the lump was indicated BIRADS 4- which means it is a suspicious abnormality with a chance of malignancy. I was scheduled for a core biopsy. This really scared me.

The radiologist made me scared based on how serious he was, but the nurses for my biopsy were SO gentle and treated me like a baby deer that was about to run, despite me being fine. It made me scared that I was sick. I dealt with all this and expressed to my parents that I was scared and highly anxious. They reacted by downplaying the issue and kept telling me that I was going to be fine. I have previously expressed to them that being told “you’re fine/it will be fine” is not comforting to me in scenarios that are out of my control, they only make me frustrated because it feels like a lie to me. 

Luckily, the biopsy came back negative for cancer. It’s just fat necrosis from a previous surgery and is and will always be benign. I expressed to my mother that I was really scared and wanted her comfort but she didn’t offer it. I wanted a hug or just any recognition that I was dealing with something very scary. She expressed that she knew I would be fine so it was no big deal. I expressed that no one knew if it was fine or not- that’s what scared me. I feel like I went through a really scary event and was dealing with a lot of anxiety and was left to suffer in it alone instead of getting the comfort I needed.

13,1dma2aq,AITA for snapping at my mother,"Just a  little backstory leading up the situation. 

I (36M) am married to (39F). I also have a sister (39F) (this fact will make sense later in the story.) We have been together for 9 years and married for 6 of them. I have a somewhat of a unique last name. Not out of the ordinary but certainly different. There’s more of us in the country other than my family. My mother has had this weird little obsession of “passing on the family name” and if I dig deep enough in my memory I’m pretty sure it predates me meeting my wife. 

Originally, when dating, my mother was kind to my wife but as soon as we got married it’s like she couldn’t fake it anymore and started on the typical MIL bullshit. She likely blames my wife for us living in a different state (even though it was a decision made by the two of us).

Well anyways, we currently have a 16 month old little girl. (Whom my mother has seen twice in her life).  When the news dropped that she was a girl, the subtle disappointment of not being a boy was leeching out of my mother. We recently found out we were pregnant with baby #2 and before even finding out the gender she was already saying stuff like “hope it’s a boy” “gotta pass on the family name”. Every time she mentioned it I made some snarky comment like my daughter’s husband is changing his name. Or she’s gonna hyphenate. And just kept making hints that it doesn’t matter. 

Immediately I began thinking what a terrible way to look at my daughter (her granddaughter) as a disappointment of not being able to pass on something as mundane as a last name. I then thought of my sister and what kind of way she must be feeling being the first born and probably disappointing my mother by being born female until I was born.

A couple weeks ago we found out baby #2 is a boy. We hesitated telling my family cause we already knew what my mother was going to say. We decided to release the information through Facebook and like a foregone conclusion, there was her comment about praising it being a boy and “passing on the family name”. 

When I saw this comment I lost it. I texted her immediately asking her “Am I a Duke? Do we have some land with a castle in Wales that I need to be aware of?” Acting lost she responded “what?” So I sent her a screenshot of her Facebook comment with a response of “I sure hope my sister was never made to feel less than cause she “couldn’t pass on the family name. It doesn’t matter but I’m certainly not going to allow my daughter to feel less cause she’s a girl”

She then responded with “are you being serious or is this you joking?”

I then told her “I have hinted to you time and time again that that is a rude and inappropriate thing to say but you still continue. So now I’m being direct: this is a rude and inappropriate thing to say. I love you. Goodnight”

14,1dma1oq,AITA for snapping at someone for calling me snobby for where I went to university and work?,"Throwaway for anonymity

Three pieces of background info:
1. I come from an immigrant family that only knew of Ivys. My parents NEVER pressured me to go, but from a young age I really wanted to make them proud.
2. As a teen I got frustrated with my state’s policies and practices, so I decided I would go out of state for college.
3. My family was low income and a minority so I knew if I went to a private college, I would get a lot of financial aid and if I get a merit scholarship, it’d be almost a full ride.

I was accepted to a top school that was MUCH cheaper than any state school and better for what I wanted to study. My parents hadn’t heard of it before I got in and were proud of me, but they were even more proud when they found out the rank. I graduated a couple years ago and applied EVERYWHERE for jobs, even in my home state, and had a couple of job offers. The best offer paid the most, was in a low COLA, and aligned with my interests, but also at an Ivy. Again, my parents were proud I could even get a job in this economy, but my mom was quick to post to FB about it.

I acknowledge prestige was part of my decision making as again, low income family and a minority, I need whatever advantage I can get in life to be successful, but I never talk about the prestige. Where I work or went to college only comes up if someone asks me.

Ever since I left for college, some people from my hometown have viewed me as a snob, and I feel like it worsened with my job. I visited our hometown recently and met up with some people from high school. Someone asked where I work now, and I said x school. Another person said “of course” and I asked what they meant. They said ever since high school I’ve been so snobby wanting to go somewhere prestigious, and that there’s nothin wrong with not going to an Ivy. I said that’s true, but I applied to universities that were the best for my major and they all happened to be out of state, and I took a job that aligns perfectly with my career goals. I also pointed out how no one had heard of the university I attended before I got in, and that people only found out about its “prestige” the day we graduated because someone looked up the rank.

They still insisted I was a snob and started ranting about how I make people like her look bad because it looks like she didn’t work hard enough. Some people agreed with her and I snapped.

Three pieces of background info:
1. I come from an immigrant family that only knew of Ivys. My parents NEVER pressured me to go, but from a young age I really wanted to make them proud.
2. As a teen I got frustrated with my state’s policies and practices, so I decided I would go out of state for college.
3. My family was low income and a minority so I knew if I went to a private college, I would get a lot of financial aid and if I get a merit scholarship, it’d be almost a full ride.

I was accepted to a top school that was MUCH cheaper than any state school and better for what I wanted to study. My parents hadn’t heard of it before I got in and were proud of me, but they were even more proud when they found out the rank. I graduated a couple years ago and applied EVERYWHERE for jobs, even in my home state, and had a couple of job offers. The best offer paid the most, was in a low COLA, and aligned with my interests, but also at an Ivy. Again, my parents were proud I could even get a job in this economy, but my mom was quick to post to FB about it.

I acknowledge prestige was part of my decision making as again, low income family and a minority, I need whatever advantage I can get in life to be successful, but I never talk about the prestige. Where I work or went to college only comes up if someone asks me.

Ever since I left for college, some people from my hometown have viewed me as a snob, and I feel like it worsened with my job. I visited our hometown recently and met up with some people from high school. Someone asked where I work now, and I said x school. Another person said “of course” and I asked what they meant. They said ever since high school I’ve been so snobby wanting to go somewhere prestigious, and that there’s nothin wrong with not going to an Ivy. I said that’s true, but I applied to universities that were the best for my major and they all happened to be out of state, and I took a job that aligns perfectly with my career goals. I also pointed out how no one had heard of the university I attended before I got in, and that people only found out about its “prestige” the day we graduated because someone looked up the rank.

They still insisted I was a snob and started ranting about how I make people like her look bad because it looks like she didn’t work hard enough. Some people agreed with her and I snapped. I pointed out how I took every single IB/AP our school had to offer and did several internships in college, and that I’m still working my ass off now because I have plans to go to med school.

She has always loved Taylor swift but I haven’t really been the biggest fan. No hate against Taylor swift it’s just not my kind of music except for a couple of songs. Lately, my cousin has become that person where if you tell her you haven’t seen a movie or heard a song she will sit there and play it for you and make sure you listen to every single lyric or line. She also does this if you say you don’t care for an artist and she thinks that if you listen to them more and more you will all of a sudden like them. 

With all of the Taylor swift hype lately, she’s become a huge Swiftie. Now when I come to her house or hang out with her all she does is blast Taylor swift songs. Whether it’s in the car or at the house, she’s always singing Taylor swift or playing her music telling me to listen intently to the lyrics because she loves them. I’m all for her loving music but that doesn’t mean I need to like the same type of music as her. I finally told her that I don’t care for Taylor swift and I frankly don’t want to listen super intently to her songs nor do I need her album or songs brought up in every conversation we have every time we hang out. Whenever I say this she just says “I’ll change your mind about her one day”. It’s getting really annoying so my response to that comment was “it’s going to be really exhausting hanging out with you then since I’m forced to listen to something I done care for”. 

I didn’t want to come off as rude or unsupportive of her liking Taylor swift but I would rather listen to songs that we both enjoy with a little Taylor swift mixed I here and there. I feel like when I hang out with my friends I try to play a neutral mix of pop music that maybe everyone can enjoy and I wouldn’t play music that somebody has expressed they are not a fan of.

19,1dmzv5g,AITA for doing my laundry?,"Hey folks. So, here's the deal. My flat has an in-unit washer/dryer that is, unfortunately, in the primary bathroom attached to the primary bedroom. We often have to ask the roommate (Mia) who is in the primary bedroom if we can do laundry (weekends only; an odd stipulation in our lease; don't ask). The problem is is that she is WILDLY unresponsive to her texts. There are four of us. Mia has basically claimed all of Friday as her laundry day, leaving three of us with roughly 24 hours (laundry hours are like 7a-7p)m to figure out when to do laundry.

Back to the unresponsive thing. All of us have jobs, lives, etc., so we can't exactly wait on her to reply all the time. Sometimes it's even hard to get an answer out of her face to face. So, now, if Mia leaves, someone will often just go into her bathroom to do laundry *quickly*, and get out. If she comes home, we text and ask if we can come in and finish it, and are often left waiting for *hours*. We've started doing this *because* we've *tried* to talk to her about this, and she always says the same thing: ""Oh, but I need my privacy."" Which is so fair! I get it.

However. She chose that room. She knew what came with it. We all pay to use the washer/dryer. And she refuses to work with us regarding any kind of schedule, communication, etc. Today, I noticed she wasn't home, so I did my laundry because I knew that it was my only chance to do so this weekend. She came home as the dryer was running, and is now peeved at all of us and lowkey accusing us of knowing her schedule (we don't; if anything, we have no idea what her schedule is) and finding that weird.

20,1dmzer3,WIBTA for going off on my fam?,"(PSA: no real names are being used in this post)

Ok so I (20F) live in my dad’s house with my dad (48M), his mother (67F *let’s call her Callie*), and my cousin (22M *lets call him Brad*). As of a couple months ago, my dad let me take his room because of Brad moving in and taking my room while I was spending a couple nights with my friends. I was told that apparently Callie “thought I moved out” and gave him my room. (Disclaimer: this is the third time that Callie has given my room to Brad without consulting me OR my father.)

As of a few days ago, the living situation that my fiancé (18M we’ll call him Alex) had went off the deep end and I asked my dad if it was okay if he moved in for a bit until we can get our own place. Dad said that was fine, Alex and I agreed to paying rent and helping out with groceries and food for my cat and lizard.

Well this all just so happened to take place two days before I was supposed to go on a 4 day trip with my mom’s side of the family. Those two days go by just fine, nothing happens, Alex and I went and bought some food for him to eat while I’m gone as well as some dry and wet cat food and some fruit and such for the rest of the house.

I’m now at the end of day two of my trip and Alex is texting me about my dad and Callie saying all this out of pocket bs to him. Basically saying rent is due on the 1st and that my dad is mad that we “took over his room” along with Callie saying that everything under the sun is annoying her. I don’t understand what went so wrong in the two days I’ve been gone.

I should also add that for a while, Brad’s girlfriend was also living in the house before Alex moved in, and they got treated like royalty. They didn’t pay rent or get groceries and neither of them could drive so Callie had to take them everywhere. And on top of that, all Brad and his girlfriend did was argue. They would yell and slam doors and put holes in the doors and walls every day.

Brad still doesn’t have to pay rent and still cannot drive, whereas I have my own vehicle and help out where I can, Alex and I never argue and for the most part keep quiet and out of the way, unless he gets mad at his game but usually he doesn’t. And after hearing that I got so mad at my family for playing favorites that I am considering calling my dad and yelling at him, Alex is trying to calm me down and tell me not to, but all I want to know is WIBTA for going off on them?",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-23,"WIBTA for going off on my fam?

24,1dmxsss,AITA for not throwing away a utility rag used to pick up a dead roach? ,"Hosted a party for family and friends; during the party, my wife found a dead roach on the carpet (We were cleaning like crazy before the party so the dead roach was new in the last day or two after that room had been cleaned). She motioned quietly for me to come over and asked me to pick it up discreetly and get rid of it.

I had a semi-used utility rag in my hands already, and since I thought the discretion was called for, I just bent down and picked up the dead roach with the used utility rag. My wife proceeded to be shocked and promptly told me to throw away the rag when I was done. I thought throwing away the rag was a little much, but instead of arguing against it in that moment, I nodded OK and went off. The Dead roach went into the trash and the utility rag went into the empty washer.

Some time past and my wife approached me and asked what I did with the roach and rag. I was honest and told her I disposed of the roach but put the utility rag in the empty washer for us to discuss later. She didn't say anything about it after that. At the end of the night when the party ended, I could tell something wasn't right. I approached her and she said she was really hurt that I lied to her. I told her in that moment that I didn't lie, but I did feel the request to throw away a perfectly good utility rag was a little odd and I wanted to have a conversation with her about it later but didn't want to ruin the party.

I was a little hurt by the statement that she claimed I lied, because in almost 10 years of marriage, I've never lied to my wife; not once. The next morning I asked her how she was doing, and she again started saying that she was really hurt over being lied to.

I explained to her again in more detail that I thought the request from her to throw away a perfectly good utility rag was outrageous to me. Some laundry detergent and bleach and that utility rag would be sanitized and clean. From my perspective, you don't throw away perfectly re-usable stuff like that; however, I told her if she really didn't like, I would just throw it away... and I did.

At this point I was getting upset because I didn't feel like I had lied, but she clearly thought I did. At this point she won't talk to me. She keeps saying that I have made this about myself and being called a ""liar"" when the real issue is I didn't do what I said I would do when I nodded ""OK"" about quietly throwing both the roach and the utility rag away.

While I have apologized about the miscommunication and even done what she first asked, she refuses to apologize for calling me a ""liar"" and is continuing to hold a grudge against me all weekend.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for not throwing away a utility rag used to pick up a dead roach?

25,1dmxqzc,AITA for not tutoring my friend‘s child because it is taking a toll on my mental health?,"Basically, I (21) with germ themed OCD and also other mental struggles, am tutoring my old neighbor‘s and friend‘s 8 yo boy.

Its a complicated story, but let‘s say the mom is struggling and needs help but doesnt want any besides tutoring for him. But he has adhd, dyslexia and is absolutely feral whenever he has to read / spell. 

I love this kiddo, i do. But i am not a professional and it‘s so exhausting to sit there 4-5 hours with him for 20 bucks and try to teach him like… everything. 

It breaks my heart seeing him struggle, he cries, screams, throws things, like proper tantrums.

The other thing, they literally have stomach bugs every other week, like 2 times a month sometimes😭 and with germ themed OCD thats hell. i dont like disinfect anything bc i learned to not do that anymore but my mind keeps me awake every time i saw him.


Am i the asshole if i say i dont want to tutor him anymore? I am not good at setting boundaries and also am a people pleaser so idk if i should or not drop him because i feel like i‘d be hella an asshole.



EDIT: He does NOT do 4-5 hours at once just studying. We take small breaks every 5-10 minutes depending on how hard the exercise was. He snacks, or we talk, play lego or tennis in the breaks. After multiple exercises with small breaks in between we take a bigger break. No pressure from my side. We joke around a lot, he plays with my cat, etc.  He is at my place for 4-5 hours total tho. He wouldn’t even be able to concentrate more than 10 minutes max. 

Some things like simple math equations he does while playing ball, it works for him way more. I ask the question he answers while playing. He has most questions right without help. 

But obviously reading and spelling isnt that easily done while not sitting down, thats where he freaks out. 

He can also any time ask for a break, i swear i’m not trying to burn this kiddo out, i promise.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for not tutoring my friend‘s child because it is taking a toll on my mental health?

26,1dmxor8,AITA for being pissed at my friend for changing her mind about something she was okay with in the start?,"I have a friend of 7 months who I met at school, “Ella”. Last week, during cooking class, all of us were told we will be taking part in a bake off in a couple of weeks. We were also told that we would be working in pairs (important).

Ella was clueless on what to make so I suggested cake pops. She doesn’t know what they are so I described them to her. I asked her a few times if she was okay with it and we came to an agreement. 

Our bake off is in just over a week’s time so today at home I did a test run for the cake pops. When I was done, I sent a picture to Ella to run it with her and show her what they look like. Keep in mind that I spent my own money on ingredients just because Ella had also agreed to make these. 

I texted her “I thought we could make these” and she replied with “No”. I became somewhat angry at this but I haven’t told her. After texting that “No”, she suggested waffles but none of us have a waffle maker and neither does our school so that’s also a no. 

Then she texted “Think!!!!!”. I haven’t replied to her yet. In my opinion, I’ve already done my bit and even did a test run to help us know what we’re doing on the day of the bake since both of us are beginner bakers.

It’s Monday tomorrow so I don’t know how to come across to her. In she past she’s also ghosted me IRL for not telling her a so-called “secret” of mine so I might act similarly. 

AITA? I feel like I am because it’s not like she told me to do the test run. But I also feel like I’m not because I did it to help the both of us and the only reason I spent my money on the ingredients was because she agreed beforehand. 
I feel like I might be overreacting to all of this.

27,1dmxgt0,AITA for referring someone to a job in the same way as another person? ,"So here’s the deal: I have a pretty new friendship with this girl (let’s call her Mary) - we’ve known reach other maybe a few months. She introduced me to another girl - Becca -  who was looking to move into town and so now I also had this other acquaintance. 

One day, I ran into the two of them having coffee and Becca mentioned she was applying to a job at the company next door to where I worked. I told her I knew someone there and could probably mention her name. A few weeks later, Mary messages me and asks if I could put in a good word for her at the company I worked for, and sends me her resume, asking if I can forward it along. I tell her, sure, happy to send it along.

For both of them I do the usual email message - hey I know this person, she’s really great, I think she’d be a great fit - etc. A few days pass by and then I get a message from Mary saying she’s really upset that her “best friend” (me) didn’t give her an even bigger, more preferential treatment and referral, that it should have been more generous than what I did for Becca. She then told me I had a monopoly on all the good jobs in the area (we worked in similar fields) and she expected more from her bff.

I wasn’t aware that she referred to me as her best friend - we’d only known each other for a short while and while she was great, she had never called me that in person, and I had plenty of other friends I was much closer with. I also had never worked with her, and while her work was good, it wasn’t necessarily great. AITA here or should I have somehow treated her differently than Becca?

My car is secondhand and it's just a small old cheap thing. It has scratches and dents but it runs well.

The issue is with my family. My mom (F50's) and sister (F26) keep urging me to resell the car and get a big 'family car' like an SUV.

9.26. To use the Premises solely for the purposes of a private residence for the Tenant and any other persons specially permitted by Landlord to occupy the Premises.
9.39. Not to assign sublet or part with or share possession of the Designated Room and Shared Parts or any part of them, nor allow these to be occupied by anyone other than the Tenant and no more than the maximum number of permitted persons (the Occupancy), without the prior written consent of the Landlord.
9.40. Not to grant any licensees, take in any lodger, paying guest or person staying on either a permanent or semi-permanent basis without the prior written consent of the Landlord.



Edit: I'm confronting him or should I clarify with the landlord if each room is leased individually? Which it is, just to prompt some questioning.


I [19M] live in a houseshare UK with three other people. One [22F] is great and we get on very well, and a 22F as well. There is a man [22M] is fine but not always overly considerate so not great to share with.

The flatmate has a girlfriend that attends the nearby university, he came last Saturday and eversince then his girlfriend has been here everyday since then. She sleepsover here, I hear them having sex, poor girl living opposite the bed. And by sleep I mean sleeps here everyday since last arriving, she has never introduced herself to the landlord knowing that she is breaching the contract. For context, I live right next to his room. We only have one bathroom between the (now) five of us. She also showers at ours, does laundry here, she arrives to the house  when he does. 

I think this is a bit unreasonable, especially since the house is small and within the agreement, the landlord specifically states it's a contract of 1. I have not raised it with him. And I dont bother to, I am fucking frustrated, loud, having sex, lady moans like an anime girl. It can't be that good?

31,1dmx48w,AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t need to loose weight but it might be better for her if she did,"I 15f told my sister 13f that she’s fat because she asked me to tell her the truth and now she’s treating me like the asshole and I’m at a loss for words. Yesterday my sister asked me to help her lose weight she said she is stuck at 180.5 pounds, not saying I’m skinny either I weigh 165.5 pounds which I know isn’t good for my age. I lost weight by swimming a lot for a sport I joined I go to summer practices everyday of the week other than Friday and Saturday while my sister sits in the couch all summer watching movies I told her I could talk to my coach and see if she could come out and swim with us she agreed I have yet to talk to my coach but I know I could ask him tomorrow. The real issue came when I told her she needs to watch what she eats because something’s will make her gain more than reduce I told her carbs can do as long as she exercises after cause if she doesn’t she will just gain more. Today she told me I’m the whole reason she wants to lose weight when I haven’t said a single thing about her weight unless it’s just sibling bantering where she always starts the conversation with me or my brother being fat. I’ve tried to talk to her about how it’s never us calling her fat first it’s always her bringing up the conversation and us countering back at her saying the same thing she did. She has ruined sleepovers over this conversation once she said she reminds herself of Theodore from Alvin and the chipmunks and when I agreed with her she went ballistic while my two bestfriends were over she texted both my mom and my dad who are divorced and live in separate houses we were at my dads at the time texting them both that I called her fat I ended up getting in a bit of trouble and them telling me to stop calling her fat when I tried to explain my side they hadn’t even really tried to listen, my bestfriends told me there siblings do the same thing but her doing that pretty much ruined my entire mood. I really do want to help my sister flourish and help her with whatever she needs help with, not saying she isn’t flourishing now.

Yesterday my sister asked me to help her lose weight she said she is stuck at 180.5 pounds, not saying I’m skinny either I weigh 165.5 pounds which I know isn’t good for my age. I lost weight by swimming a lot for a sport I joined I go to summer practices everyday of the week other than Friday and Saturday while my sister sits in the couch all summer watching movies I told her I could talk to my coach and see if she could come out and swim with us she agreed I have yet to talk to my coach but I know I could ask him tomorrow. The real issue came when I told her she needs to watch what she eats because something’s will make her gain more than reduce I told her carbs can do as long as she exercises after cause if she doesn’t she will just gain more. Today she told me I’m the whole reason she wants to lose weight when I haven’t said a single thing about her weight unless it’s just sibling bantering where she always starts the conversation with me or my brother being fat. I’ve tried to talk to her about how it’s never us calling her fat first it’s always her bringing up the conversation and us countering back at her saying the same thing she did. She has ruined sleepovers over this conversation once she said she reminds herself of Theodore from Alvin and the chipmunks and when I agreed with her she went ballistic while my two bestfriends were over she texted both my mom and my dad who are divorced and live in separate houses we were at my dads at the time texting them both that I called her fat I ended up getting in a bit of trouble and them telling me to stop calling her fat when I tried to explain my side they hadn’t even really tried to listen, my bestfriends told me there siblings do the same thing but her doing that pretty much ruined my entire mood. I really do want to help my sister flourish and help her with whatever she needs help with, not saying she isn’t flourishing now. I can see both sides to this but she doesn’t ever listen to me I can see how I am the asshole and how I’m not.

32,1dmx3dq,AITA for texting my mom that I wanted to leave?,"My (16F) parents have been separated for almost 8 years and our mom has full custody.

My dad had asked my brother (13M) and I to visit his home this Saturday to celebrate our birthdays with him. I was very hesitant as I hadn't seen him for around 9 months. My brother on the other hand has been seeing him regularly for the last year. I decided to go in the end as my brother has been enjoying spending time with him and hasn't had any issues with him. My dad also told me that his parents would be there which made me happier to go. Plus my little brother begging me to.

So yesterday my mom dropped my brother and I off at our dad's house. It was just him and his parents weren't there. He said they couldn't make it because their dog was sick. From this point I was immediately on edge. I hadn't been alone with my dad for a long time without another adult or one of my older siblings. 

My dad seemed over excited and not sober. Things were fine for the first hour. I think he could tell I wasn't entirely thrilled to be there. At lunch he started to get irritated with me because he was asking me personal questions and I was answering too bluntly, at one point he asked me ""why are you hiding things from me? I'm your dad."" He also drank 2 beers while we were eating lunch.

By the end of lunch, I felt uncomfortable. During lunch my mom had texted me asking me how things were. Afterwards I was in the bathroom and replied I felt uncomfortable as dad was drinking and had become irritable. She replied saying she could come pick me up early, I told her I didn't want to make dad mad by leaving early. She told me her and her boyfriend were going to leave now anyway and wait down the road. 

20 minutes later, my brother dropped the TV remote, and the batteries went flying, causing my dad to swear loudly at my brother and shout at him to be more careful. At this point I texted my mom and asked her to pick me up. 

I told my dad a couple minutes later that mom was coming to pick us up and he predictably got mad and was asking why. My brother was a little peeved to. A few minutes later my mom rang the doorbell. He started telling my mom he still had a couple hours left and that she was early. She told him we were both coming now. An argument ensued and after about 5 minutes my mom's boyfriend got out of the car and came to the door and basically told everyone to go. He had a short unpleasant exchange with my dad and then we finally left.

When we got home my brother was mad at me because he didn't want to leave (him and dad were playing video games). But he was mostly mad at me for causing issues with dad saying it was my fault things went badly and I was overreacting. 

Was I the asshole?

So basically we were watching some silly reels until we have found some reels where girl said ""When you have to be jealous for all ugly girls because you know that your bf's ex was looking like a roach"". So basically that was our conversation after seeing this reel:

Her: Relatable, with your ex-girlfriend.

Me: Ok, I guess I will have to be careful when I see bulky guys with muscules

Her: That was an accident during work

Me: Yeah me too.

Her: What are you saying? That your other ex-girls were beautiful? Show me

Me: I don't think you would like that

Her: So you are saying I'm uglier than them

Me: No I haven't said that, I've just said that because after I show you any pictures of any of them, you would then tell me after that something like ""Why you had other girls before me"".

Her: But you didn't say I'm most beautiful one.

And then she started crying, and after that basically she was guilt-tripping me, saying I shouldn't say something like this. I've said to her that it was just response for her joke, and I was also kidding, but also i've said it honestly because of her low self-esteem she would probably feel bad if I would really do that and show her some pictures of them. She then said ""Yeah whatever"" and started crying even more, after 10 minutes, when her cries were louder I have asked ""what just happened' but she only started to say ""YOU KNOW WHAT I DONT HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT AGAIN"" which starts next harsh argument.

I don't know, have i done something wrong till that point? I was just following her joke after her. She says that I could say that in many ways but i've chosen the worst one, even though I hadn't say anything, I wasnt bragging about this previous girls or whatever.

recently he texted me to ask if I would cut his hair for him (I have been cutting my own hair for years), he has really long nice curly hair that he's been growing out for ages so I said if he still wanted it done in a week then I would. 

yesterday was one week after that convo and he showed up at my flat out of the blue (which he took a bus by himself to come to) and asked me to cut his hair. he was clearly really keen so when I asked him if he was sure and he said yes I did, because to me it is no big deal. I gave him a bob at first but he wanted shorter so in the end I took quite a lot off. then he went home. 

My mum called me literally 30 minutes later so as soon as he got home to yell at me for cutting his hair. she wouldn't let me explain thats what he wanted she just shouted at me for ""violating his beautiful hair"" then hung up. 

Today she came round and told me off for parenting her kid and that I don't get to make big decisions about his body, only she and my dad do, that if I had cared to ask him what she thinks that he would have told me that she was against it so I was directly violating her order to him to not get it cut (he didn't go to a barber because he couldn't afford it by himself and she refused to pay). 

Apparently the reason he wanted a haircut is that he is going to a summer camp during the summer holidays with kids who made fun of him last summer for looking gay and like a girl but my mums view on the matter was him getting a haircut was ""letting the bullies win"" so I overstepped by cutting his hair and taught him a lesson that he should change himself for the sake of bullies.

Their mother and my mother are sisters, and they are very close. They talk very often if not daily. My aunt’s husband, my uncle, and I are close too. My aunt and uncle live in the same state as my immediate and extended family now, but when I was in college, they lived on the East Coast. My college was closer to my aunt and uncle, so I would spend my school breaks with them, which is how I became so close with my aunt, uncle, and my little cousins. 

My relationship with my aunt, uncle, and cousins developed away from the rest of the family, so the dynamics are different. Despite, the age gaps between my cousins and I, we’re very close. They’re more like siblings to me. All of them treated me as another member of their immediate family. They sent me back to college with food, money, and support. To this day, I am forever grateful, and I never forgot. They are my second family.

When I was in grad school, my aunt, uncle, and little cousins relocated from the East Coast to our state to be closer to the family. I have been the cool older cousin, and as I have grown in my life and career, I have shared my successes with them whether it’s sending over gifts, cooking my cousins’ favorite foods, or helping them out with school work. I have watched them grow up, which is priceless. Although I am busy, I try to find time and visit as often as I can. My aunt and uncle always remind me that I am welcomed at their house. In fact, I am visiting my cousin at college. We’re both excited by this.

Lately, my parents are not happy with me visiting them. They feel that I visit my aunt, uncle, and cousins too often and I need to restrict my visits with them.  Whenever, I visit them, my parents become moody about it. Yesterday, my cousins ubered themselves over to my house to spend the day with me. It was great!  I made them breakfast, showed them my yearbooks and family photos, and gave each of them small gifts. We went out for the rest day, shopped and had dinner before I dropped them off at their house. While we were at dinner, my mom and dad call me numerous times to drop my cousins back at their home or call an uber for them. It got so bad that my parents called my cousins while we were at dinner, which was embarrassing.  I feel like my parents were trying to control my time with cousins. I drove my cousins home after dinner and visited with my aunt and uncle before I left. They were very appreciative.

Our business is an annual event that will happen late next year. Since the beginning, we agreed we will split up the marketing 50/50 and that everything we do we must both agree.

I kept telling her I didn't like to be looped in after an artist was already chosen, a draft been done, and now all I get to contribute is my 2 cents. She kept saying she was sorry and that she meant to include me on everything. I would warn her how important it is that we do things together and that ""at least nothing has been published"" so that we can fix things before it's live. 

Fast forward to last week...she showed me the artwork for our social media launch post and I liked it. But we agreed that we wouldn't post it until another few weeks to align with a big event we will be at. Then I'm scrolling social media and I see it has been posted. 

Not only that, but the post was littered with typos and had incorrect information. There were comments from people asking us to clarify when the event is actually happening. 

I messaged her angrily saying ""WTH, why was this posted without me knowing?"" And I sent her the edits to the caption. Not even 2 days later she sends me a draft of a 3D modeling project that is a significant cost at this stage in our business. I blew up. I listed out all of the things that have recently been done without my knowledge and told her ""I'm not kidding around anymore. This is unacceptable. This isn't just your business. This is a partnership."" 

Her response was first to say I've done the same thing, to which I responded ""how so?"" (It is fact that I haven't spent a single dollar or publicized anything without it being reviewed on paper), then she said she would just back out of everything except for 1 area of the business. I responded ""it doesn't matter how much or little you work on, it won't change your habits"" to which she said that she needed to step away from the conversation and is now refusing to speak to me.

Last year my(34M) ex (33F) ended our 16 years relationship. We have a good friendship. Although we are still getting used to this change we already have gone a long way.

Today she will do a dance presentation that she's been practicing for this year and I told her when she started practicing that I would go. Which was my plan until today the day of the presentation.

The thing is I met someone wonderful last month and we are developing a really nice relationship and we have two days left before I have to leave country and stay two months away. She works all day, including weekends. We can only meet after her work the exact time of the presentation.

When my ex ended our relationship I said I would still be her friend and support her the best I can. But I made clear that I would always prioritize my romantic relationships over my friendship with her. Like she always demanded I did for her when we were together.

And so I feel like going to see her at the cost of losing one of the few days I have left to better know someone I'm having a great time with will be going against what I settled for myself which is not prioritizing my ex over new relationships.

When my ex ended our relationship I said I would still be her friend and support her the best I can. But I made clear that I would always prioritize my romantic relationships over my friendship with her. Like she always demanded I did for her when we were together.

And so I feel like going to see her at the cost of losing one of the few days I have left to better know someone I'm having a great time with will be going against what I settled for myself which is not prioritizing my ex over new relationships.

39,1dmw1eu,WIBTA If I told my parents the truth about how my sister really dresses?,"Background: Muslim family both sister and I mid twenties. I finish uni with bachelors, sister in grad school.

My sister has been as usual gone all week at school and today she was ask to help clean around the house. Mind you I work all week and still cook last night while cleaning around the house. Things got heated between my parents and my sister exploded saying that just because she a girl she does not need to spend all day cleaning (she never ever cleans I mean the most you get from her is 30 minutes once every 2 weeks that she half asses and we just put up with it to avoid more fighting). She also never worked a job and doesn't help with any of the bills while I been paying since I get legally could work. Anyways she says she can't clean today  because she was going to go play soccer on the other side of town (which means someone else would have to because come Monday she be in school and won't lift a finger). She was screaming saying she more religious and traditional than anyone else in my family and that my parents should trust her more. Things cool down and my parents left to go do errands.

This is where the issue and my guilt starts. Less than five minutes when my parents are gone my sister in tiny shorts, no headscarf, and a t shirt goes to play soccer. Mind you she never ever dresses that way around my parents and brags she more religious than us. Again let me state I have no issue with how people dress. I am religious myself and even as a guy follow the protocol for how men are suppose to dress. I know it harder for girls and I never ever criticize my sister or mom if they choose to dress differently. Everyone is free to make their own decision in life. I do have an issue with the lying. My sister screaming about honestly and trust to just do the exact same thing she was saying she does not do is horrible. My parents trust her and she does the opposite. She did not see me as I was in the garage and only saw her by accident.

Now maybe you assume she was running late or something but she was walking casually and deep down I know that how she dresses when no one around. When my parents are out of town she dresses way ""looser"" and when she goes for runs she always tries to run in parks as far as possible from home either in the dead morning or late at night. I also at times caught her doing less than well \*religious\* things by accident (either I was just in the area or she came to my store and didn't realize I was on the clock). I never ever said anything to my parents about these things because I always figure it was not my place to tell. I also heard a lot about my sister from others but always dismiss them and assume the best. I don't want a big fight to break out again and she an adult if she chooses to live differently that her decision but at the same time I feel extremely guilty not telling the truth to my parents especially seeing my sister tell bold face lies to their faces and bragging about who she is when she really isn't. I honestly wish I just did not see anything.

Update: I appreciate the advice people gave. There are some strong responses on here but I understand that when I made this post. This is not an easy topic to discuss and with the targeted demographic being different than where I am from traditionally there would be some strong response. I really truly felt conflicted about this topic and wanted more opinions instead of just making my own decision or assuming I knew best. That being said I really appreciate some of the outside pov and advice I was given. The responses some gave really help to change my view. I know I get downvoted regardless but I do want to say I do love my sister and want the best for her and have zero desire for revenge,  policing her, or any of the other comments thrown here. I know I can never understand walking in her shoes and talking her to her or ignoring the situation entirely is the best path forward. All that being said it would really help if she could pull her weight and ask I fairly but politely if she can tone down the bragging about being more religious than everyone if such a thing pops up in the future.

41,1dmvnff,AITA for Telling My Friend She Was Acting Selfish at My Birthday Party?,"So, I(14F) just turned 14 last weekend and had a small birthday party with some close friends at my house. We had pizza, played games, and just hung out. It was going great until my friend, let's call her Emma, started acting really weird.

Emma has been my friend since elementary school, but lately, she's been very focused on herself and always wants to be the center of attention. During the party, she kept interrupting everyone to talk about her problems and wouldn't let anyone else get a word in. She even took over the music and changed it to songs only she liked.

I was getting pretty annoyed but tried to stay calm because I didn't want to ruin the mood. However, when we were about to cut the cake, she suddenly started talking about how her parents are getting a divorce and made the whole moment about her. I understand that's a big deal, but she picked the worst possible time to bring it up.

I couldn't take it anymore and told her that she was being really selfish and making my birthday all about her. Emma looked shocked and started crying, then stormed out of the house. Some of my other friends said I was too harsh and should have been more understanding, but others said Emma was out of line.

Now, I'm feeling guilty because I know her parents' divorce is tough, but it was my birthday, and she didn't even seem to care. AITA for telling my friend she was acting selfish at my birthday party?

42,1dmvl37,WIBTA if I leave my family and their business?,"Ooof this is gonna be a long one:

So I (17F) don't have the best relationship with my parents, my father especially. They are from the USSR and my father is ex-military, saying they are conservative is an understatement. Another important note: my family is pretty rich, upper-middle class, maybe even lower-upper class. (This is gonna be important later).

Some background: When I was sixteen I got my driver's permit and I didn't ask or expect my parents to buy me a car. They bought me a new toyota prado (and don't get me wrong I'm super thankful)

They are currently paying for my university.

They own a business and they gave me work in the family business with good pay.

They pay for stuff like getting me hair, nails done, sometimes some clothes, and a phone/computer.

They bought me some pretty expensive jewelry.

I know all of this sounds like literal paradise but it honestly sometimes my family feels a little like a dollhouse: perfect on the outside a mess inside. First off I know some people (including my parents when they were children) have it much much worse than me, but my dad did order my mom to punish me with a phone charger cable about 7 times in my life since I was 8 up to the last time when I was 14 I think.

Also while they don't punish me like that anymore, whenever we have an argument my dad loses his patience really easily and he shouts and says stuff like ""Let's go, before I \*unalive\* her"" to my mom right in front of me. And when he says that I get really scared.

Also whenever I'm talking to them it always feels like im being interrogated: whatever I say can and will be used against me. Like whatever I say, they will interpret it literally the worst way possible. And they also have this thing where they just always want me to be the ""leader"" in any situation. Like when I went to a theatre club every time I'd get home they would interrogate me about who I'm friend with? If I'm the leader in the friend group? Why I think so? Do I have any enemies in the class? And unless I give perfect or ""correct"" answers to the questions they get mad at me. So I just tell them what they want to hear.

And my dad always takes credit for my achievements. For example when I graduated high school at 16 with a 4.0 gpa and we went to a restaurant to celebrate he raised said ""we graduated high school"" and that it isn't my achievement for graduating early and instead its my parent's achievement for raising me well.

Another situation was that I applied to a few universities. And I got accepted into all of them including my first choice university. My parents however, wanted me to study in my second choice university because it was in a ""conservative right-wing state"". And I tried to convince them but I ended up just giving up because I was afraid my dad might get angry at me for ""not listening to him"".

Now the actual situation: They rented me a separate apartment at 17. Again, I didn't ask them to. When I was 15 I wanted to go to university overseas after graduating high school, they didn't want me to move away at 16/17 so they offered me a deal: I could move out to a separate apartment in a building close by but I would instead attend university online (As I did high school). So I accepted and moved out at 16. They rented me a small studio apartment. About 6 months later some financial troubles started and my paren't business started bringing in much less money than before. I offered for all of us to move back in together into our original bigger apartment so they wouldn't need to pay for my studio apartment anymore. They told me that wasn't necessary. Instead they decided they wanted to rent two two-bedroom apartments, live in one, I live in the other, and they have our offices in my apartment. I didn't like this idea because I felt like my apartment wouldnt really be mine anymore. So I offered to instead keep my studio apartment and search for a slightly bigger apartment for them but still within the price range. At first they agreed and even told me I didn't need to look for an apartment for them and that we could just organize our offices in their new apartment they had already chosen. Then the next day my mom told me they changed their mind and they still wanted the office to be in my (new) apartment. She didn't just leave it at that, she tried to convince me to agree to this willingly not just because ""they said so"". I in turn tried to show her my point of view. After a while of just this stalemate I told her that I don't agree with their decision but that I accept it and that maybe I just need some time to understand it better. We left it at that. The next day though my parents told me we ""needed to talk"". They yelled at me about how ungrateful I was, how I never even invited them to my apartment (I did, they just didn't accept the invitation), how I was using them, how they gave me a job etc. and they told me I was moving back in with them immediately. It honestly really hurt me because I truly was respectful to them and I honestly did appreciate everything they did for me and I couldn't understand what I did wrong to cause them to get so so angry with me. About a month later, out of the blue they changed their mind and without even mentioning the previous situation they told me they decided to rent the two two-bedroom apartment and have the office in mine as they planned originally. I agreed and didn't say anything. After a little while they offered to rent me a separate studio apartment again and have the office in their apartment (Which is exactly what I offered originally).

After this situation I just got this feeling that my entire life depended on their mood. And that as long as I depended on them and their business they would still hold power over me. And they want me to take over the family business after I finish university but I just realized a few things:

1. If I take over the business I will always depend on what they made for me. I will always be indebted to them and I feel that I will never be able to say ""no"" or resist them in any way.
2. I simply don't want to continue their business. I have my own dreams and hopes and I want to open my own clothing brand and I won't be able to do any of this because I will feel like I have to dedicate myself entirely to their business.

Another factor that is slightly unrelated is that I've known I was by since I was 14 and actually think I might actually be lesbian. My parents are quite homophobic and when i tried to come out to them my mom just said that ""oh its normal for girls to want to experiment, itll pass once youre older"". And they think I have to marry a man because ""A true pair, a true marriage is between a man and a woman"" (side note: they're not religious just conservative). What's more is that they started searching for a husband for me since I was 14 and they want me to marry a man who is at least 5-10 years older than me. And I know it won't even be my choice because they always say ""How are we going to find you a husband"". And the truth is: my dream is to marry a lovely and kind woman, not a man. And my parents would never accept that.

So after all of this i want to wait till I finish my bachelor's degree in about 3 years and leave. i want to move to europe and start a new life.

Now I know that my parents love me, especially my mom, and I know it would hurt them that I left because at one point they said that basically everything they did, they did for their child. But at the same time I don't want to live my life how they want me to. And they have enough money from their business to live comfortable for many more years so I wouldn't be abandoning them entirely.

(Also if I do decide to leave, I might have to do so without even saying goodbye properly and just run away in the middle of the night because I'm afraid my father would physically try to stop me )

43,1dmvhuz,AITA for telling my friend shes been insensitive lately? ,"My friend and I, both women over 30, have had a really beautiful, open, and honest friendship for six years. We've shared and talked about everything under the sun, joyful and sad. We don't live in the same country but have talked via voicememos for most of our friendship. During that time we’ve helped each other through pretty much everything.

Around when I got a new boyfriend she disappeared for months, which worried me, but I understood since she tends to withdraw when overwhelmed with life. She eventually came back, and things seemed okay until I moved in with my boyfriend. Three main things happened.

1)During one of my anxiety attacks about work, she asked if I was pregnant. If I'd asked her something like that during an attack she would have mentally spiraled. I brought it up later and she felt like nothing was wrong due to her intent.

2)I'd been trying really hard to keep my art and art page going, inspite of the anxiety attacks. While talking about potential aesthetic changes for my page, she told me I needed more finished pieces, even though she knew I was trying my best and how much it bothered me that I hadn’t been able to finish pieces. It felt like a blow while I was struggling, especially since she’s an artist and understands the challenge of creating while stressed. I felt like I was being extra so I didnt tell her how much that bothered me.

3)A family member canceled a holiday dinner last minute, which sucked for several long winded reasons. Venting to my friend, she started to validate my feelings then spent most of the talk making me feel silly for feeling upset.

We’ve always been clear about needing to be heard and validated when venting, not advised. I told her, in a voicememo that some of how shes been recently has felt a little insensitive. I made sure she knew that I understood she didn't mean to hurt me. Her response was anger, saying she wouldn't apologize (which I didn't ask for) and that she needed a few days.

When I checked in, she acted like our six years of friendship didn’t matter. She said she hadn't thought about what happened and that I needed to wait until she was ready to talk. She claimed she was afraid I'd yell at her again, prompting me to relisten my message multiple times. I wasn’t yelling; I even had friends, who will be honest with me, listen to be sure.

I ended up telling her that her feelings are valid. That I listened to the message alot and I really didn’t feel that I yelled, however I'm really sorry thats how it came off. That Im okay with waiting but I don't know how a friendship continues if we don't talk abt this. She never responded.

",No A-holes here,2024-06-23,"AITA for telling my friend shes been insensitive lately?  My friend and I, both women over 30, have had a really beautiful, open, and honest friendship for six years. We've shared and talked about everything under the sun, joyful and sad. We don't live in the same country but have talked via voicememos for most of our friendship. During that time we’ve helped each other through pretty much everything.

Around when I got a new boyfriend she disappeared for months, which worried me, but I understood since she tends to withdraw when overwhelmed with life. She eventually came back, and things seemed okay until I moved in with my boyfriend. Three main things happened.

1)During one of my anxiety attacks about work, she asked if I was pregnant. If I'd asked her something like that during an attack she would have mentally spiraled. I brought it up later and she felt like nothing was wrong due to her intent.

2)I'd been trying really hard to keep my art and art page going, inspite of the anxiety attacks. While talking about potential aesthetic changes for my page, she told me I needed more finished pieces, even though she knew I was trying my best and how much it bothered me that I hadn’t been able to finish pieces. It felt like a blow while I was struggling, especially since she’s an artist and understands the challenge of creating while stressed. I felt like I was being extra so I didnt tell her how much that bothered me.

3)A family member canceled a holiday dinner last minute, which sucked for several long winded reasons. Venting to my friend, she started to validate my feelings then spent most of the talk making me feel silly for feeling upset.

We’ve always been clear about needing to be heard and validated when venting, not advised. I told her, in a voicememo that some of how shes been recently has felt a little insensitive. I made sure she knew that I understood she didn't mean to hurt me. Her response was anger, saying she wouldn't apologize (which I didn't ask for) and that she needed a few days. She then stopped talking to me for around two months.

A brief resume of the history is that they have never seen each other in person, as they are from diferent continents. They met in HABBO, a game which simulates reality and you interact with other people. His virtual couple have some serious problems: Poverty, drugs... Also, she made some comments in the past that where not apropietate to my friend during their relation.

My friend kinda left his own life appart to support his virtual couple, even though she was not grateful and instead despised him (Obvisouly they had their good moments, in a Arguing/Forgiveness circle). Finally relation went over due to some nasty message to others boys from her.

I cannot comprehend his behaviour. I told him that it's just some random person he met online, he doesn't even know her in reality. In top of that, i cannot understand why someone would carry this burden of having to take care of someone who is into drugs when he hasn't even seen her.

When they were dating, he send her some money because she was having a bad time financially. I already advised him not to do that.

Now, I can't withstand his grieving. I told him that for me this type of relation is very inmature (I can understand that you do it with 15 years, but not as grown up adults). I'm tired of his grief as if it were his 10 years wife and they were living together.

49,1dmtzrm,AITA for asking my social worker to let me live with my grandma instead of my aunt?,"My mom lost custody of me 3 years ago. She's always had issues and she's been in jail a few times. I (15m) have no dad in my life so I'd go to my aunt typically until my mom got out and took me back. But then she lost custody of me for real and my aunt took me in. 

My aunt was going through her own really difficult time. My uncle, her husband, died, and she was left alone with her son (10). A few months later she met a guy called James and they hit it off and ended up moving in together and getting married by the end of that same year (they met in February). James has a daughter (11). James' ex had divorced him a few years before and wasn't around their daughter. She didn't remember her mom and was feeling mixed about the blended family. Sometimes she really wanted a mom and other times she didn't want to have a new mom or share her dad with my cousin.

The two kids could not get along and living with them was miserable. My cousin misses his dad so much and he's angry that his mom married again so fast. He was mad that James' daughter was sometimes calling his mom 'mom' and other times telling her she's not her mom and to go away. He was angry James was trying to do stuff for him that his dad used to do (take him hiking, father's day events and stuff).

It was such a mess and I was miserable being in the middle of all that. They were in therapy and everyone came back from that so unhappy.

In the end I was talking to my social worker and I asked if I could live with my grandma instead. Grandma said yes. She was so happy. I moved in with her last week. But my aunt was so hurt I did that and my cousin misses me. He asked if he could live with me and grandma too. He told grandma he doesn't want to live with James or Katie (James' daughter) anymore and he'd be way happier with her and me. My aunt was even more devastated by this. She told my cousin he still had her and he told her he didn't want James or Katie and he couldn't have her without them. They ended up talking and he told her he wished James and Katie would go away forever and never come back. I think some of my aunts anger came from that and was directed at me over my cousin.

51,1dmtllj,AITA for telling my mom that it’s inconsiderate to not keep me up to date on timeframes ? ,"
short story, but basically my mom was at drink shop that i like, so i called her and asked if she was going to be on the way home and if yes, could she grab me a drink. she said that she was about to leave to go back home and told me to text her what i wanted. i texted her, and was expecting her back home in roughly 10 minutes. 

a little over two hours passed by and she finally came home. i had tried to call her during that time and she didn’t pick up any of my calls. when she gave me the drink, it was missing two add-ons that i specifically had asked for. i told her that i appreciate that she got me the drink, but i wish she had given me an update of how long i would have to wait. she said something along the lines of “you don’t understand, i was on my way home, but then xyz told me that they needed me to get them something so i took a detour”. i told her that im not peeved that she took a detour, i just wish that she had told me that i would have to wait two hours. and the drink would come watered down and whatnot. by then she slammed my drink down, spilling it (there was no lid), called me ungrateful, and then left me to clean it up. 
 
this is such a minuscule situation compared to every other story, and i know that it’s not a big deal. i was just wondering if i was TA for not just accepting the drink, and instead telling her that i wish she had given me an update, instead of not answering my calls.

this is such a minuscule situation compared to every other story, and i know that it’s not a big deal. i was just wondering if i was TA for not just accepting the drink, and instead telling her that i wish she had given me an update, instead of not answering my calls. ",0.0,0.10320751368999481,0,1
52,1dmth1y,WIBTA if I asked my friend for us to meet in a restaurant that doesn't have a playground for her kids?,"My friend and I both 32F, have been friends for our whole life. She now lives in another country and comes back home each summer. She has 2 kids (6F, 3M) whom I love dearly. The problem is, each time we go out when she's home, she picks a restaurant with a playground for her kids. Now I don't mind them always being with her, because her parents doesn't really help her and arranging for a day only childcare in our country is not that easy. But when we get there she spends almost all the time on the playground with them and I will be alone at the table. If I wanted to be alone I would rather be alone in the comfort of my home.

My thought is if there's no playground her kids would be sitting with us at the table so she wouldn't have to leave me alone for a long period of time. I know that of course she will still be attending for them and it wouldn't be only about us catching up, but at least we would be able to have some sort of conversation. If it was like a one time only it would be fine, but each time we meet it has to be somewhere like that.

We will be meeting up on Tuesday and all the places she suggested are places with playgrounds, so will I be the asshole if I asked her to meet somewhere with no playground?

Edit: to address frequented suggestion in the comments, she stays at ger parents place and as I said her parents aren’t really very welcoming. My place is an hour away in a bigger city and she doesn’t feel comfortable driving there with her kids plus it’s being renovated now and I’m staying with my parents for the time being. 

Last summer I suggested my parents place because they have a big outdoor space and they don’t mind children and she knows them and they love her and I offered to pick her and her children up so she wouldn’t have to drive, she accepted and my parents bought lots of things for the kids but she changed her mind she said she doesn’t want to be a burden even though I assured her it wouldn’t be.

For the people whom are making me look like a bad person, of course I help her with the kids when we are together.

53,1dmt1dq,AITA for telling my parents to kick out my housemate's (married) immigrant Indian boyfriend?,"Since I have a chronic health condition (with high medical expenses) and am in graduate school, I'm living with my parents in my family home I grew up in. My parents are renting out a room downstairs to a woman who I have become friends with. Last year, she started dating a married (supposedly ""separated"") Indian man who illegally crossed the border to the USA (apparently as a political refugee) and is working on his greencard. A few weeks into them dating, he tattooed her name on his chest and showered her with gifts. Shortly after that, he had a mental breakdown (he's bipolar), moving out of his apartment and quitting his job.

My housemate was worried about him becoming homeless, so she spent thousands of dollars renting an Airbnb for them to live together while also paying rent. My mom felt guilty that my housemate was spending so much so she offered to have her boyfriend (who was very charming to my mom) live with us for a short transitional period (a few weeks) while he looked for housing. That ""few weeks"" turned into 9 months. My parents increased the rent slightly for him to stay (additional cost of utilities/water, wear and tear on house, etc) and we thought he and my housemate split rent together. My housemate recently had several emotional and financial-related mental breakdowns (leading her to seek an intensive psychiatric day program), and confided in me that she is paying for everything: both their rent, groceries, even his phone bills! Also, she is spending all her spare time arranging his doctors appointments, writing his resume, and more. Despite her boyfriend working 2 jobs, he says he is ""broke"" and is spending all his money paying off his “debts”, sending all his money to India, and even financing his siblings weddings (which he says are >$100,000). He owns a $40,000 car, and wears his $7000 gold chain and his wedding band around his neck (which I find disgusting). Despite that, he says he is broke and would be homeless without her.

He acts charming, generous, and respectful to us, but the facts around his situation concerns me and I think he is scamming/exploiting her. He calls us all his ""family"", calls me ""sister"", and calls my partner/fiance ""brother"". He acts as if we are all one big family, which feels very uncomfortable and forced. He bows down and sweeps my mom's feet to ""show respect to elders"" (which she finds extremely charming) but it feels awkward, sycophantic, and disingenuous to me. He also pretends like he's not married and doesn't have a daughter (we know because my housemate told us, but he thinks we don't know). After learning that he is exploiting the generosity of my mentally unstable housemate, I do not like him and want him to leave our home. My mom likes him (since he acts charming to her) and feels sorry for him because he's had a hard life and is lonely since his family is back in India.

We help or guide her with almost everything. Since she's uncomfortable with me or my dad helping her shower, we've set an arrangement with her sister (~65?F), who lives down the street, to help her shower every other day.

The thing is, every time she's over there's a nagging, condescending complaint or I find her doing unnecessary and invasive chores. Keep in mind we don't need the stuff our aunt nags us for and we're extremely organized for grandma's sake. What she ""cleans"" and nags about are either none of her business or deliberate.

Today she decided to do my laundry nagged about my underwear having a discharge stain. I asked ""why are you even in my underwear?"" and she responded with  ""because your laundry bin had clothes in it"". This turned into a whole passive aggressive back and forth how rude it is to dig through my room without permission, and her insisting that she was trying to help around the house and there should never be dirty clothes in my room anyway. She kept cutting me off and I yelled over her with ""this isn't your damn house; I'm not your kid"" She just kind of groaned it off and went and left early.

My mum, who lives five hours away, has taken two weeks off work around my due date and the following period. I was unaware of her specific plans until she announced she would be staying at our house. She knows we value our privacy and prefer not to have guests due to limited space and my partner's irregular/unsociable work hours.

We recently moved to a larger house, but the spare bedroom is now the baby's nursery, fully furnished and decorated, with no room for even a single blow-up bed. My mum believes that because we have more space, she is entitled to stay with us.

I struggle to spend more than a night with my mum due to her narcissistic and manipulative behavior, which I've endured my whole life. When we visit her, it's usually a short stay. I don't want her around constantly before/after I give birth.

AITAH for snapping at her just now when I discovered she’d eaten one of the three snack cakes I had for the kids’ lunches? 

While I generally don’t object to sharing food with the ex, I’ve asked her on several occasions not to eat the treats I buy for the kids because I generally apportion them equally and plan my grocery shopping accordingly.

I just went to make lunch for the kids and one of the three remaining Zebra cakes in the package was missing. The kids are still not into pilfering food so I asked the ex if she ate one of them. She smirked and said “yeh, sorry.”

I’m already tense over having her on my home while I still do approximately 80 to 90 percent of the child care. This was too much. I snapped and,  while I didn’t yell, I very forcefully told her she shouldn’t take their food and that she needs to shop for herself (I’d just picked up a few things for her this morning at wal mart because she rarely has the wherewithal to shop for herself - see a pattern here)? 

She responded by telling me that she’d be open to a discussion if I didn’t use such an aggressive tone.

So am I the asshole for taking an aggressive, forceful tone and pretty much chewing her out for once again screwing up my plans for the kids’ lunches?

61,1dmr2a6,AITA for removing one of my best friends from my bridal party?,"
I, (22 F) have a friend “C” who is in my bridal party but has really been a bad friend recently. 

She got married this past March and I do everything I could do be supportive towards her (thrown her a 1000$ bridal shower where she got NO ONE to show up), brought gifts to every bridal event, etc. we have been friends since we were 14/15 and I have only met her now husband once and it was at their wedding where I was a bridesmaid. 

now it is my time to get married and ever since her wedding she has been really gloom about the whole thing. I am buying everything else for everyone so the only thing they have to pay for is their dress and shoes (both should be under 250$) so it’s not a money problem. anytime I type in the bridesmaid group chat she ignores it or replies three days later. 

I threw a bridesmaids luncheon with swimming so that everyone could get to know each other and so we could informally meet her husband she texted me fifteen minutes after it started saying she couldn’t force him to go so they won’t be attending. I wrote her a text explaining how I felt and she just sort of blew it off, but anytime I want to do something to support her she is instantly fine. 


I just don’t know what to do. This is one of my close friends. We have always talked about how we will get married and make a huge friend group. I have tried to be a good friend and do everything to support her but I don't want to lose the friendship or also be miserable this entire time of my wedding. This is such a sweet season of my life and I don't want to have to worry about her the entire time. Please let me know the honest truth of what you think and how I should continue.

I (51F) came home after a long day of work and dealing with what to do with my mother’s (91f) dead cat. All day long I received texts and calls. My mother is very challenging, I’d say she’s more manipulative than loving. I was at work and couldn’t do anything to help the situation, she won’t take any of my suggestions and then gets passive aggressive and mean. It is a big issue for me and gets me very worked up. I have been to counseling which has been very helpful. My mom’s drama always been hard in my marriage and I am aware that my over venting causes problems.  

I spoke to my husband about it throughout the day, twice to be exact and two texts, then came home and talked a bit more. BTW my sister and I ended up finding a service to come get the cat and dispose of it properly. My husband (51m) listened in the beginning but also suggested just throwing it in a dumpster, then got frustrated about his day not being acknowledged. He got more and more frustrated ( he had a very good day and wanted that to be celebrated). 

At dinner he vented about his voice not being important for the entirety of dinner. My daughter (17f) and I were both frustrated with this response and let him know. He then said to us "" you are both cunts and should fuck off and rub your cunts together ""

It’s been 5 days, I am still infuriated for my daughter and myself. He feels like I’m self centered and because I called him an asshole after the argument it’s the same as his name calling. Am I an asshole for not acknowledging his work win before talking about the cat, should I be over this?

63,1dmquoh,AITA for proposing that we each buy our own food?,"My husband and I are in a tough spot financially. We bought a house last year and got into debt fixing it up.

He also has some properties he rents out on AirBnB and had to make some big expenses to fix up some of his properties this month.

We agreed to a 40-60 split on joint expenses when we bought this house, but now he wants me to pick up more of the mortgage payment. I can do that, but for me that means that I have to re-budget my lifestyle to make it work, so I said I would agree to the new mortgage payment split, if we can each buy our own food.

Most of our grocery list is ""extras"" that he buys. I was okay footing 40% of $800 a month when we agreed on the split, but now that finances are tighter, this spending category is the biggest place where I could make this work.

He got really angry and shouted at me. He said that it feels like we're roommates and that I'm the AH for balking when I feel financial pressure.

I feel like I am trying to keep my head above water and I tried to compromise.

Info: We have a joint checking account and pay all of our joint expenses out of it. We agreed on the 40-60 split based on income. Our expenses come out to a little under $7000 a month, so I direct deposit 40% of it. The Airbnb's are all his business and we agreed in the beginning that it's all financially his. I help him out with cleaning and moving stuff.

I had them for about a year and I also own another pair of sony headphones. Since I had the money and was saving up a bit from the part time job I have, I got them. 

At first I wasn't too sure because I knew my hispanic mom would not be too happy with my purchase. However it's my money that i've earned and I feel like I should be able to use it on things I want. I got them and automatically my mom started lecturing me and telling me that I already have too many electronics like what else do I need she exclaims and she brought up how i'm not happy with what I have etc. She then proceeded to take them from me and told me that their hers now because I lost a pair of bluetooth earbuds years ago btw they weren't $200 which is what I paid for the pros. 

I took them back and told her they're mine because I paid for them. I was feeling so suffocated with the complains of me and lecturing so I decided I was just going to return them the next day. I placed the box with everything in it including the airpods right next to bed and in the morning they were gone. I went into her room and she had them. At this point I was getting annoyed, but that's when she told me not to return them(the airpods), that she would buy them off of me, and i agreed to her proposal. 

I later changed my mind and took them back and told her she hasn't payed me anything yet so I have the right to use them because they are MY airpods. So I used them for a full day and she didn't bug me for them. I thought that was end of this dilemma we were having. but no she storms into my room the next morning asking for my airpods and me half awake and seeing her mad face, I felt like I had no choice but to give them to her she used them the whole day and I asked for them back but she told me I had my previous ones. 

So this morning my little brother found & gave them to me so I brought them to work, while I'm at work she sends me a message calling me ""estúpida"" meaning stupid, it has a worse negative tone and meaning in spanish.

66,1dmpse3,AITA for trying to smell an essential oil in store?,"I was in Holland & Barrett today, I go quite often so they know me and I’ve spent quite a lot of money there, usually to get essential oils for my diffuser or monthly supplement top ups/‘clean’ skincare. Today when I was in I opened the box of an essential oil to smell it (bearing in mind they’re easy to open and reclose, I would never tear anything open, open tape etc). A staff member came running over and asked me not to open it, I replied with ‘oh sorry I was just going to smell it’ and he said ‘no it depletes it for whoever buys it’ and walked away. 

I just put it back in its box and left the store, admittedly a bit embarrassed as there was a few people in there. I’ve smelled oils in there many times before and no other staff member has had a problem, I would never use any of the product, just remove the lid and smell it and return it to the shelf as if it had never been touched. I’d also only open it because it’s a fragrance product, the same way you’d do with candles/perfume etc. I would never care if my oils had been opened before, I feel like it’s kind of expected. I sort of reckon the staff member doesn’t actually know what they are lol. I went into Yankee candle instead and they actively encouraged me to open them and smell them and offered me samples etc, so I ended up spending £30 in there on oils. 

Maybe it’s just me, but if that hadn’t happened I would’ve continued getting them from H&B and probably spent £30+ a month on them in there. But instead, because of the awkward encounter, I’m now considering going elsewhere for my products - I probably spend £100/month in there if you include everything else I buy…

Am I the asshole or do you think that one staff member was just being a bit over the top? It’s not a huge deal, he was polite enough, but as I said, I usually spend quite a lot of money in there and now I’m probs going to go somewhere else…

67,1dmps49,AITAH for threatening my ex’s job?,"TLDR: my ex, who was my manager and also was very friendly with his ex (coworker of his) messed me up big time and treated me like an ugly secret for over a year, and got family banned from his location after I left him. So I filed a very honest HR report against him, putting his job in jeopardy. 

So I met this guy as a coworker originally. He was one of my managers, and he started chatting me up and I fell for it. He asked me to be his girlfriend, but because of work, he wanted things to stay on the down low. So I couldn’t meet his friends (coworkers) and I couldn’t meet his family. He met mine though. 

A couple months later, I moved away and we were kinda medium distance. Now work didn’t matter because I didn’t work there anymore. Still I couldn’t meet his parents and he refused to tell anyone that he wasn’t single.

He also confessed to me that one of his coworkers was his ex. He was with her at the same time he was chatting me up, and they broke up a couple weeks before he started pursuing me, so I found out I was a rebound. And he still worked with her, texting her and snapping her daily. 

After nearly a year of dating, I told him that I will no longer tolerate the current arrangements. I asked him to unfollow and stop snapping his ex. He refused to and so I broke up with him then and there, drove to his place at midnight, and left a box of his belongings on his car without seeing him. He begged me for another chance the next day, apologizing and promising he would make changes. 

He removed his ex from everything. He said that he wanted to make things right. He said he wanted me to meet his parents, he started telling people that he was dating me, and I thought maybe he actually was fixing things. Wrong. 

About two weeks later he drives to my place, on the day we were supposed to go out, and says “I need space” and “I’m not ready for a relationship” after a year. 

We didn’t call regularly. I didn’t force him to text me. For a long time we only saw each other maybe twice a month. I wasn’t invasive or controlling. I probably tolerated too much. I even tolerated him working with and communicating with his ex daily. The reason that changed is because I found out that he lied about the depth of their relationship, making it seem like nothing when it was more. 

After he treated me like shit for months, he showed up wanting special treatment for him instead of making things better for me. I walked away, very hurt. 

And then he got my brother banned from the location my ex works at. He lied to his bosses and said my brother threatened him on site, which I know he didn’t. 

So here is AITAH: I submitted an HR report on my ex. Because he was my manager, and he chose to mess around with a subordinate. And he also did the same thing with his ex, she was his subordinate and while they were dating he helped her become a manager. That’s against policy. So I decided, “no more hiding.” It is likely that he will get demoted or fired. AITAH for choosing no more secrets?

68,1dmppqd,AITA for moving my flowers in Palia?,"In addition to playing for herself, my partner keeps playing on my Palia profile, helping me with all sorts of things, from gathering materials to building and decorating my house/plot. She spends a lot of time and deliberation on this, and has the time to do so because she is a homemaker rather than an income-earner (due to multiple disabling conditions). I work a full-time job, and don't often have creative ideas or inspiration for what to do with my plot. When I do have an idea, I share it with her, and she's very good at helping me accomplish it. But then... she goes above and beyond, adding embellishments, whole other projects, sometimes even disregarding my desires in favor of her own ideas.

69,1dmpnti,AITA for making my dad sleep on the couch with a bad back?,"
Hello! Im F16 and im just kinda confused and i feel very alone. Now for context i used to live with my mom F47 who was abusive and neglectful(my parents are divorced). I lived with her up until last year when i finally moved with my dad M77 in his 1bd apartment. Its difficult to share space and i have to sleep on an airmatress in the kitchen which can often be dirty. Since my dad is an older generation where mental illness wasnt very normalized he has issues taking me seriously. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and that has contributed to me having breakdowns. 

Two days ago i was sitting alone while my dad slept in his bed and i saw a bug on his desk and i just went to inflate my air mattress. I have a huge fear of bugs. After i was laying on my air-mattress i saw another two small round bugs crawling on it and i screamed and ran up to my dad. I told him that there were bugs on my bed and i couldnt sleep and i didnt know what to do. He said i could figure out staying in a hotel or i could sleep on the airmattress or go to a friends house. It was around 12Am so going to a friends house was out of the question and so was a hotel because its expensive. My dad said i was being selfish and i stormed out of the house for around an hour. When i got home i went into his room and asked what i should do and he said i dont know and after a while of arguing he let me sleep in his bed while he slept on the couch. i felt extremely guilty but i wasnt sure what else to do. 

The next night the same issue happened and he slept on the couch but when i went uo to him to ask if he was okay he said i planned everything and that i was a selfish bitch. 

Today i have the Geometry regents(a 3 hour test about some of the classes you took)since i live in NYC. When i woke up i texted him asking if he would drive me to the station and get me breakfast but he didnt answer. I left a note apologizing and saying i would see him the next day since i was going to sleep at my friends house. 

I feel like such a burden to him especially when it feels like he hates having me there. We havent been close since i was around 7 and its really hard for us to be near eachother without arguing. I feel so alone and i have no idea what to do or what to say to him. I wish he loved me the way i see my friends parents love them. We havent hugged in over two years and he doesnt say i love you. everything feels so conditional and i dont know what to do. I understand he didnt ask for me to live with him and he does his best with what money he has but i cant help feeling disappointed in the situation.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for making my dad sleep on the couch with a bad back?

70,1dmpfu3,AITAH for explaining myself versus just accepting and moving forward?,"
Context: so when me(m30) and my wife(f28) get into an arguement It usually goes something like this:

Her: you did X action and I feel hurt by it

Me: I’m sorry I didn’t mean make you feel hurt by it. My intention was (context on why I did what I did)

So according to her if she tells me that something I did hurt her my answer should just be “I’m sorry I made you feel that way, I will fix it” with no added context or opinion because “it’s not needed and I didn’t ask” (I know this sounds harsh but it isn’t)

Her example she uses is as follows: “if I run over your foot I should apologize for running over your foot because regardless of what the context was at the end of the day I still ran over your foot”

I understand that. 

However, I feel like explaining why you do said actions matter because you can feel hurt by something but if the persons intentions were something else that can either help me to make me feel not as hurt or understand why they went that route so I can be better informed on if I PERSONALLY am overreacting. To me this is because there have been instances especially when in my previous relationships or hell even growing up where someone was hurt by something I did and when I provided context or explained why I did what I did it helped to mitigate the situation or find out a deeper root of why they were hurt.

71,1dmpdvo,AITA for expecting my friend of 15 years to proxy vote in my stead ?,"Hi,

I'm (25M) a bit puzzled here. In a few weeks, my country (France) will hold unplanned elections, which is problematic for me because I work 4 hours from where I have to vote and I usually come back once a month. I did not plan at all to come back for this week, because I have other stuff to do. Moreover, I would have to pay for the train or for the gas and the highway, and I would have to stay for the week-end.

In France, we have ""proxy vote"": we can ask someone to vote in our stead, but they have to vote in the same place we are supposed to vote, which is my town 4 hours from where I work. Thus, I thought I'd ask one of my closest friends (25M), who I have known for 15 years, and who lives like 15 minutes away from my town.

This friend was staying over for a long week-end where I work, with another friend, it was just the three of us, I let them stayed in my place, we used my car to visit the places I wanted to show them. Today, before my friends left, I asked the one living near my home if it was ok with him to vote for me on election day.

To my surprise, he refused. He said he wasn't even sure he'd go voting himself, so he wouldn't go proxy vote for someone else. I know for a fact he doesn't have anything planned this day, he is currently unemployed and he basically said that if he didn't want to vote, it was because of lazyness.

I calculated how much time he would need to vote in my stead : 30 minutes to go to my town and come back, and 30 minutes at most to vote. So 1 hour in total. While, for me, it would be 9 hours of car, even more by train, and like 100 euros for travel, plus I'd have to stay for a few days, during an unconvenient period for me because of my work (it's the beginning of the touristic season and I'm working in the tourism sector) and because I promised another friend I would help her for something else the same day.

Am I being unreasonably pissed here ? I thought about it: maybe he thought he did enough stuff already for me - it is true that, when I did not have my driving licence yet, he drove me many times to places we both went, but it's been a few years and I've been returning the favor. When he had to take a train, I let him stay in my place because it was more convenient for him, I also once stayed in his home because the morning after I could take him with my car to the train station to drop him there on my way home.

I don't want to ""calculate"" how much each of us owes the other or anything, I don't think it's healthy to keep count, but I don't think I asked too much of him on the long run. And I think it was very rude of him to refuse this for me while he literally was staying over in my place for a vacation.

TL;DR : Election day is near, and it would be very difficult for me to come back to my town to vote, but my friend of 15 years refuses to proxy vote in my stead, while it would be very easy for him to do so.

A few hours later she messaged to say she’s really upset by my reaction. I didn’t sound happy or excited enough and it’s the biggest thing in her life. I said all the right things but I can’t remember what my tone of voice was like, I was shocked and it was also hard to sound too jubilant because she sounded quite anxious and unwell.

We were supposed to get married recently, but the wedding has since been cancelled due to disagreements about our future, among other things.  She canceled the wedding less than 2 months before the date, and of course we lost a good sum of money, but she claims that she still wants to be with me.

The cost of living is astronomical. We have been saving money and hoped to get a condo, but my fiancée has now told me that she is leaning towards buying her childhood home so her sister (22F) will have a place to live (with us).

I have made it clear to her that her childhood home would not feel like my own place, even if we bought it together. Not to mention her sister is very messy, does not contribute to the household, and lacks responsibility. More concerning for me is the lack of privacy we’d have since we’d be sharing common areas with her sister, who only works sparingly.

I tried to sit down with my fiancée and explain how that house doesn’t work for us, being that her parents never updated it and had work done without permits, and that I’d have to commute over 2 hours each way to get to my job. My fiancée’s commute would be less than 20 minutes btw. She claims that she wants the home for financial stability, but I can’t accept that I would be traveling that long after working all day to come home to that living arrangement. I also feel like we’d be taking on more than we can afford, which is also stressing me out.

I like my fiancée’s sister, but do not want to live with her for the rest of my life. I wanted my fiancée to talk to her sister and hopefully put her on the right path so she can support herself, but she has not sat down with her.

76,1dmozoh,AITA for not going to my older sisters wedding?,"So my family dynamic is a little complicated, but I have an older and younger sister. Older sister is 5.5 years older than me and we have never had a relationship. We grew up in the same house, but she hated me when I was born (because I took attention from her? Just a guess, haven’t asked lmao). I tried really hard to develop a relationship with her when I was younger and tried even harder when I got to high school/college but it never worked. I finally gave up on forcing a relationship with her because she was obviously just not receptive. I decided I tried my best and it wasn’t my fault. It is always a little awkward because my little sister and older sister are close-ish and I am close with my little sister as well so it feels like she is in between us a little. 


It doesn’t even bother me anymore that she was so against having a relationship with me. We are super different and would probably just butt heads even more if we had a relationship of any sort. 

My parents are very traditional conservative types and they pressured my older sister to invite me to her wedding. My mother insisted that I go and said I would regret it later if I didn’t go. I honestly feel like my sister was probably happier without me there unless she wanted to pretend we have a perfect family dynamic. 

My parents are pissed that I didn’t go and they said I can’t come on our family vacation next month now. I am a little surprised that they aren’t putting themselves in my shoes at all on this one. I asked my little sister if my older sister seemed upset and she said she never mentioned me and was mostly worried about the weather that day because the wedding was outside. It seems that my parents are more upset that they didn’t come off as perfect parents, people probably noticed my absence and wondered why. My older sister doesn’t care, so I don’t think anyone should care. I don’t feel like I missed out on anything, the way my sister treats me, it was basically a strangers wedding. AITA? 

*also, jsyk I made a new acct because I show my family stuff off Reddit sometimes and I don’t want them to recognize my username. 

ETA: 
My younger sister just messaged me and let me know that she told my parents she wouldn’t go on vacation with them if they didn’t let me go. I didn’t prompt her to do that and idk what their response will be. 

Also, I forgot to mention that when my mother was talking my older sister into inviting me, she said she wouldn’t pay for the wedding if she didn’t invite me. My older sister is also a little more traditional/conservative so I think the perfect family image thing could’ve swayed her some as well but the money was the biggest factor. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for not going to my older sisters wedding? So my family dynamic is a little complicated, but I have an older and younger sister. Older sister is 5.5 years older than me and we have never had a relationship. We grew up in the same house, but she hated me when I was born (because I took attention from her? Just a guess, haven’t asked lmao). I tried really hard to develop a relationship with her when I was younger and tried even harder when I got to high school/college but it never worked. I finally gave up on forcing a relationship with her because she was obviously just not receptive. I decided I tried my best and it wasn’t my fault. It is always a little awkward because my little sister and older sister are close-ish and I am close with my little sister as well so it feels like she is in between us a little. 


It doesn’t even bother me anymore that she was so against having a relationship with me. We are super different and would probably just butt heads even more if we had a relationship of any sort. 

My parents are very traditional conservative types and they pressured my older sister to invite me to her wedding. My mother insisted that I go and said I would regret it later if I didn’t go. I honestly feel like my sister was probably happier without me there unless she wanted to pretend we have a perfect family dynamic.

77,1dmozni,AITA for giving my friend “tough love”?,"I recently got reconnected with an old good friend from high school. We were somewhat close then, but lost touch in years that passed. 

He revealed that he cheated on his wife a few years ago. She and their adult kids have since rejected him and haven’t reconnected. He was recently complaining to me because they couldn’t let it go. He said he would “accept responsibility for up to a year” but after that it’s “on them”. 

I let him have it. I told him that he has no right to tell his kids how long they should be hurt. He was the one who betrayed their mother, and he shouldn’t expect to be forgiven on his timeline. Now he won’t talk to me.

I might’ve been too harsh because it struck a nerve.  My grandfather was a womanizer. I saw the effects it still had on my mom and grandma even decades later. 

I’m thinking I might be TAH because we’re not that close anymore.

78,1dmovtc,AITA for canceling plans with my friends to see my teacher?,"I (18 F) just graduated. Sadly my favorite teacher wasn’t able to attend the ceremony where we got our diplomas nor the “after show party” because of personal reasons. Her not attending the ceremony was kinda sad for me because we (the people in the class that she thought) wanted to use the opportunity to give her a present to say thank you and good bye because we probably won’t see are again soon. She was supposed to attend but had to sadly cancel last minute. 

To make it up to us, she invited us to her house for a little get together next week and I really want to go to properly say good bye and thank you to her.  We also want to give her the present during the get together. 

Here is where I might be TA: I had plans to go to a party with some friends on the same day as the get together. It’s not a special occasion (eg. a birthday etc.). We’ve been to a couple of parties together and have plans for more in the future so it’s not as import of an event, even though I really was looking forward to it. I decided to not attend the party to go to my teachers as it’s, like i previously stated, very important to me and I’ll see my friends at least two other times during next week. We do a lot of stuff together so it’s not like we see each other once a month and I’m canceling. 

I texted them that I won’t come to the party and explained why. One of my friends is really angry at me for canceling, one just wrote ok and the others haven’t responded even though I know they’ve read the message.

79,1dmojr4,AITA for calling out my friend over his behaviour,"I am a 25/M and last week I was babysitting my nephew who turns 5 this year as his parents will be out of town for a wedding over the weekend. So my nephew's staying over at my place for the weekend. My group of friends usually host a weekend dinner at any of our apartments once a month at least to catch up and hang out and this time it was my turn, I informed the group if I can skip my turn this time and do the next as I'll be taking care of my nephew but they said they didn't mind and would love to hang out with my nephew. I checked with my brother and sister-in-law and they said its okay for my friends to come over as my nephew's a generally sweet and well behaved boy. 

  
The dinner and hangout went as expected and all was well, we were all at the living room hanging out just talking about our high school days and the topic about having crushes back in school came about. All of us had a good laugh thinking back at how stupid we were back in high school. My nephew, who was oblivious to the conversation as he was busy playing minecraft on his iPad was then approached by my friend who is unapologetically open about his sexuality I assumed he was just gonna ask him about what he was playing on the iPad but the question he asked left me astonished to say the least. He asked my nephew : ""What about you? do you like boys or girls? It's okay you can tell me I'll keep a secret"" 

In my opinion, he was way too young to understand about love and attraction to other people let alone exploring his sexuality. I told my friend nicely at first that wasn't a very appropriate question but he brushed me off. My nephew, understandably was confused as he only understands that his Mommy only loves his Daddy in his short life that he's lived so far and my friend went and followed up with more statements such as sometimes we can have 2 daddies or even 2 mommies because they love each other too. Seeing my nephew feeling uncomfortable I admittedly raised my voice a little bit and told off my friend, I told him he shouldnt' be saying these kind of things to kids his age yet as they're too young and that he was being inappropriate and creepy. I quickly took my nephew away and put him to bed, thankfully he didn't ask any questions. When I went downstairs, I was met with a lot of unhappy faces, my friends accused me of being homophobic and ignorant and only pretending to accept people of diverse sexualities. I was taken aback, in my mind, I was only protecting my young nephew from difficult topics in which he wasn't ready to learn yet and will only learn when he's a little older and able to understand that there are different families everywhere. 

  
After this incident the mood went sour and everyone decided to end the night early. I'm unsure as to how to go about navigating this situation. I love and care for my friends and I'm happy they can truly be who they are and love who they want but on the other hand, there's always a right time, place and age to learn about love and its diverse forms.

80,1dmo72p,AITA for Telling BF I Don’t Want His Dad to Live With Us,"

My 25F guy friend 23M (let’s call him Ben) that I’ve been talking to for a while now lives in another state. We have known each for more than a year but have been friends for a while. We are both talking but haven’t put labels on it quite yet. We both have strong feelings for each other and plan on meeting sometime soon.

One night we were talking about our future and how we’d like it to be. Out of nowhere, he mentioned to me that wherever he goes, he’s going to need to bring his dad with him once his dad retires. His dad is now mid 50s. He said his dad is going to need to stay in the spare room in our future home because his dad doesn’t have a retirement fund, doesn’t know how to manage money (has all these guitars, a 3D printer, and currently lives in a home that’s paid off). He told me that once his dad hits retirement age, he’s not going to be able to afford to live in their current home so he’s going to have to either live with us in like 20 years for the rest of his life or Ben is going to have to pay his rent in a new place for the rest of his life. He basically told me this was going to happen.

I felt bad being taken aback by that because it was something that he’s never talked to me about before. He didn’t ask me how I’d feel about it. He basically told me it’s gonna happen no matter what but not for nearly 20 years. The reason I was taken aback was because we plan on having kids down the road. How would it work if we’re paying off our future home but Ben also has to pay for another property for his dad, especially if we’re going to have a few kids. I don’t think it’s realistic. He wants to be a psychologist. How would it work if we had a few kids as well? We probably wouldn’t be able to afford a home with 3 different rooms anyways. I’ve also worked since I was like 16 or 17 and he told me once he gets a decent job way into the future, he wants me to be a homemaker. He doesn’t want me to worry about working again in the future. Now I think I have no choice but to work until I’m 50+ if this is how the situation is going to be with his dad. 

I feel selfish and cruel for feeling put off by this plan in the future. His dad is a really nice man who’s taken good care of Ben. He’s been a good dad to him. Am I shitty for feeling this way about the situation? Obviously I would never want his dad to be homeless in the future but Ben and I haven’t even met yet and even if we did, I think I’d still feel the same way that I do now. How would you feel in this situation? He just wants to help his dad. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for Telling BF I Don’t Want His Dad to Live With Us

2. My dad passed away during my teens, but prior to his death, he's been sending money back to my grandma to make sure she is taken care of. Since his death, I've been taken over that obligation to send money back to my grandma as it was my dad's dying wish.

3. My uncle doesn't have a relationship with my grandma since he moved to the US when he was in his 20s with my grandpa. He still talks to my grandma here and there though. The last time I saw him was at my dad's funeral. He just disappeared with his family afterwards. 

  
My grandma passed away recently, and my aunt's children (my cousins) suggested that the grandkids should pool the money to pay for funeral expenses. I've asked if anyone ever got in touch with my uncle, but they said he's not responding to texts or calls (even though the text had read receipts). Honestly, I feel that it is my uncle and aunt's responsibilities for my grandma's funeral as her kids.  
  
Now I'm feeling the pressure from older relatives since I am the oldest grandson (a cultural thing) and should be the proxy for my dad. My wife and mom agree with me that I've done more than enough as a grandson.

I'm torn between just helping out one last time to make sure my grandma has a decent funeral or be realistic that this isn't really my obligation to help out.

85,1dmnonv,WIBTA for selling concert tickets,"Throwaway as my wife knows my Reddit. My work does a yearly raffle and one of the prizes this year was two tickets to a particular concert. I was fortunate enough to win the raffle! I’d really like to sell them as tickets for this particular singer in the area of the concert venue are reselling for about 3-4k each. 

The one thing giving me pause is that my wife is a massive massive fan of this singer. Like, to the point where she has been listening to this singer since their first album for the past basically 20 years. My wife wasn’t able to get the presale tickets to see the singer when they initially released and she said herself that she couldn’t justify spending that much money on resale tickets even though this singer is her favorite artist. By that same logic, shouldn’t I just sell them? We aren’t living paycheck to paycheck, but that money would still be useful. So anyway, WIBTA?

  
Edit: Y’all are right and I’m being a dick and need to communicate better. I told my wife the good news and she immediately suggested that we sell the tickets to help pay for my stepdaughter’s college. At the college she’s going to, it’ll cover at least a semester of tuition and really help our family out. I feel so bad because I know how much my wife loves Taylor, but we both agreed that we just can’t pass up that much money. To try and make up for it at least a bit, I’m doing a shopping spree of Taylor merch for my wife.

86,1dmnmjt,"AITA for not allowing my brother a last minute plus-one at my wedding, despite having an available seat?","When I say last minute, he asked my husband (M34) and me (F29) the actual day before our wedding. 

This happened almost a year ago, but it’s still affecting me a lot. For backstory - my brother (M27) has always required a lot of accommodating. He had frequent meltdowns that still happen to this day, and my parents did everything they could to make him happy (and still do), often at my expense.

Fast forward to my wedding weekend. My brother proceeds to have a difficult time emotionally during the days leading up to the wedding. I suspect it’s because the focus was very much not on him, but that’s possibly my own bias. He does have diagnosed anxiety.

At some point my brother learned that my (now) SIL’s close friend was invited. My brother and SIL had both declined plus-ones several months prior (neither had SOs). My brother saw her having a friend invited as a slight against him and unfair. However, SIL’s friend is a close family friend - her whole family was also invited. This was explained to him. 

The day before the wedding, my brother asked us to allow his friend to come for “emotional support.” We declined for a number of reasons: 
* It was way too last minute (we had details specific to each guest)
* The friend would have had to sit with my extended family, which I felt would be uncomfortable for them (my cousin couldn’t attend last minute, so there was technically an open seat)
* We did not want this person that I honestly don’t like at my wedding
* We had made a rule that plus-ones were for serious relationships only, not friends
* He had his whole family around for emotional support
* We felt that giving in to this request would lead to others, causing the weekend to be more and more centered around my brother

My brother asked us separately - he calmly responded to my husband’s no, but when I said no, he exploded and threatened to not attend the ceremony. My parents exploded as well when we wouldn’t change our minds. My mom even called me in hysterics and also threatened to not attend if we didn’t let his friend come.

My husband was extremely supportive and spoke with my dad, and I think it snapped my dad out of it. He apologized and was able to calm my mom down. Once they took a hard line with my brother (for once), he finally accepted that it wasn’t happening and he ended up having an amazing time. He even attended the rehearsal dinner that night with no issues. While my brother has yet to apologize, my parents both apologized to me that night, and the rest of the weekend proceeded with no issues.

However, despite their initial apology, they have since defended their behavior and told me they think I used my wedding as an opportunity to “take a stand,” essentially blaming me for causing them so much distress by not just giving him what he wanted. Technically we did have an open seat, and I know my brother has emotional issues. I feel like I handled it the best I could, but my parents disagree. AITA?

87,1dmn10h,WIBTA for confronting my SIL?,"This past Memorial Day weekend, my (37F) husband's (38M) cousin (32F), let's say her name is Lisa, held a baby shower, celebrating with family and some close friends. She is traveling from the northern part of the state to the southern to celebrate, where she is originally from. By this time she had just entered her 3rd trimester. Husband's family are scattered across the country so they have to travel as well.

Enter my husband's sister (42 F). The plan was to stay with us for the weekend. When they arrived I noticed her kids were coughing, but I told myself maybe they're at the tail end of a minor cold. Mind you, I have a daughter of my own (2.5 F) but against my better judgement decided to ignore the conditions of my SIL's kids

The next day I noticed the kids' coughs were a lot harsher, more consistent, wetter sounding than I had initially noticed. That's when I realized they were definitely NOT at the tail end of a cold, they were in the middle of it. Later that evening my daughter spiked a fever. Again I thought, maybe it'll be one of those low grade fevers and I can just give her a bath or something before bed and she'll be fine tomorrow.

She was not ""fine tomorrow"". The day after my daughter's temp was around 102 at its highest with no other symptoms. The day after THAT I started getting a scratchy throat and fever. I was really upset because the last thing I needed on top of being heavily pregnant (did I mention?) was to be sick while taking care of a toddler.

The next day I discovered I wasn't only sick, I had covid. Lost my smell/taste, cough, congestion, fever, etc. Come to find out Lisa, my husband, my SIL's husband, and an aunt all had the same symptoms as well. After talking with Lisa, my husband, and Lisa's husband (38M) we agreed we didn't notice anyone coughing except my SIL's kids. Granted, we were in contact with other people but Anne's kids were obviously sick, not to mention never washing their hands or covering their mouths when they cough/sneeze.

But we wondered how, after everything this planet went through with Covid, she could bring her sick children around healthy people without a second thought. ""Selfish"" and ""inconsiderate"" were a couple of the nicer words that were brought up.

It's been over a month and the affected individuals still don't have their taste or smell back 100% and it's extremely frustrating. And I'm having a hard time moving past what my SIL did because it all could've been avoided had she been more mindful. Apologies if this was long winded, I'm still upset about the whole situation and the chances that I won't be able to smell my child (I know, weird mom things) when I give birth drives me over the edge; to the point of wanting to confront my SIL about what her carelessness has cost the rest of us.

My roommate had basically done nothing to prepare. He got many of our friends to help out the next day, but didn’t even have the common curiosity to pack before hand. I knew people were coming over early the next day, so I put some earplugs in. Well I got shaken up at 7am by my roommate and our mutual friends asking if I could help.

I yelled at him for coming into my room while I was asleep to wake me up. I told him I moved all my shit myself and he had help. They said they needed more help because the furniture was heavy and they needed help packing. I essentially told him no, couldn’t go back to sleep, and went out for coffee.

Now I’m getting shit every time I see them complaining I went out for coffee while they struggled all day. I’m getting lectured that as a friend I should’ve been willing to help even if I did all my stuff myself.

95,1dml5gj,"AITA for outing my cousin [33F] on her social media that she owes me $2,000 while she was posting about her ""success""? ","My cousin Debra \[33F\] cost me \[32M\] $2000 AUD in our interstate holiday last year. She accidentally (and recklessly)  slammed the door of our rental car into the neighbouring parked car. The rental car was under my name, and consequently I was liable for the excess payment. It's been over eight months and she has yet to pay me back.

Debra argued that the rental car was shared among all seven cousins. And that accidents were a part of the risk of sharing a rental vehicle. Given that all the cousins had initially agreed to split the costs of the trip, this $2,000 should also be split. Some of the cousins were on board. Others weren't. I wasn't. I didn't agree to split the costs of entirely avoidable and reckless mistakes.

Either way, because we couldn't come to an agreement, what ended up happening was that no one has paid me a cent.

After a few months of hounding Debra, and largely getting ignored, she broke down in tears claiming that she's financially struggling at the moment, and can barely make ends meet. For context, Debra is an accountant at one of our country's big accounting firms. She has to be on at least $100,000 AUD. So she isn't struggling financially. She's just bad with her finances.

But whatever. I let it slide. And, honestly, I forgot about the $2,000—until last weekend.

Debra posted a photo of a Tifanny & Co necklace with the caption ""Hard work pays off! Success isn't easy, but it's shiny!"". I looked up the necklace; it costs $880 AUD. I responded with, ""If you were half as successful as you are pretending to be, you'd pay me back the $2,000 you owe me."". Honestly, I wasn't thinking. I was just acting out of anger. But unexpectedly people started reacting to my comment, leaving their own comments such as ""Deb owes you money too?"" and ""I see Deb hasn't changed a bit"". That wasn't my intent. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't find it funny.

Debra deleted her post several hours lately, but hasn't said a word to me. However, she must have complained to the other cousins, because two of our cousins reached out and said ""\[I\] went too far"" and that ""\[I\] should have kept the matter within the family"". Which is easy for them to say, they're not out $2,000.

Earlier today, she was at my house and started saying some rude things about James, and I told her that I wasn't comfortable with her insulting my friend in my house. She got really mad at me, accused me of policing her language, and having double standards since she knew James came to me with these issues as well. How she knew this idk. 

I told her it wasn't the same, as James was my best friend, and she wasn't. She accused me of taking sides, which I am, and stormed out, telling me she didn't want to be in my house anyway.

I (24F) have 4 roommates. Myricole (20F) and Tia (22F) and Stacia and her son (23F and 3M). Also Tia has a male dog named Flex. Yesterday Tia went to her godmother's house to do some laundry. While she was gone a friend of ours brought his female dog Fifi over saying that Tia was supposed to watch her for him. Me and Myricole let him know that Tia wasn't there and he decided to take Fifi home and just bring her back whenever Tia came back until Myricole insisted on him leaving Fifi with her saying that she'd watch her and Flex

Myricole called Tia to let her know what happened and told her the same thing. That she'd watch the dogs. After getting off the phone with Tia she said that she had to go somewhere with her friend and told me that I had to watch the dogs. She said that if anything happened to them Tia would be extremely angry with me and try to kick me out. Her and her friend left and stayed gone for about 10 minutes and when they got back they just went straight to Tias room leaving me with the dogs. Myricole just kept coming out of the room and complaining about how I was watching them

To make matters more complicated Stacias son kept coming and bothering the dogs and causing them to almost bite him. So not only was I watching the dogs I was also watching him and trying to keep him safe. Myricole came out some time later to take the dogs for a walk and when she got back she went right back into Tias room and was playing on her phone not paying the dogs any mind

Some time later she called Tia and told her to hurry up and come home saying ""I'm going out and they're not going to watch them"". After that she started waiting impatiently for Tia to come home and mumbling ""These aren't my dogs and they're not my responsibility"". Honestly I was very annoyed

When Tia came home I told her ""I don't know why she's acting like that. She wasn't even the one watching them I was"". She just said that it was fine and that she was here now.

I'm (17m) the oldest. My dad was estranged from his dad since he was my age. His mom died when he was 10. So we never knew grandma either. My dad was open about the fact grandpa wasn't a very nice man and all kinds of stuff. But he never went into details. I know he really did a number on dad because I still sometimes see dad look ashamed if he spills something or makes a mistake. I also know he tries to hold back any time he cries and looks downright disgusted with himself for crying.

Three years ago his dad reached out and my mom and my sister (15) were SO excited and basically welcomed him into the family. Dad said no way. He and mom fought a lot about it. My siblings all told dad they had a right to know our grandfather and he should love his dad.

I was dragged along at first and I stopped going. Dad has refused to have any part in it and he and mom fought because he told her his father was never going to step foot inside our house and if he did, then dad would leave and he would never come back. So mom takes my siblings to see him.

Christmas was a huge fucking fight last year because they decided to spend it with this dude and my dad refused to go and so did I. My siblings started crying into dad's face that they wanted Christmas with him. Mom was calling him selfish. She tried to do the whole ""I'm your mother and you listen to me"" and dad told her he's my father and I could stay with him if I wanted to.

My dad told my mom and my siblings since he cannot trust them with his birthday, he will only celebrate with the people he can trust now. I also heard him tell mom this couldn't continue and they needed to divorce.

Now my mom is freaking out because she doesn't want the divorce and my siblings are really upset. They told me I should help since dad and I are still close. I told them they should learn to live with the consequences of their decisions. I pointed out to mom she was always big on us learning. I told them this is a big one. My mom told me my siblings are so young and don't deserve this.

I was more than willing to ignore this though because she said it got out of hand and apologized. After the reconciliation I thought this wouldn’t happen again. Well an hour ago I wake up to blaring music and people laughing. I look at my phone and she claims people just followed her home and now she can’t get rid of them. I have worked the last 4 days in a row day and night shifts back to back, which she knows. All I wanted to do was sleep. I texted her asking what we can do to get them to leave. She responds with “nothing you’re just being dramatic.” Obviously I’m agitated by this, so I jokingly said “Would it be wrong if I called the cops lol?” To try and release some tension because I cannot handle a fight right now. She said I was being a big baby about the whole situation and that I was throwing a tantrum. All I want is adequate sleep and some peace and quiet. I can’t do that when there are strangers all over my house and land being as obnoxious as possible. So am I the asshole in this case?

I have worked the last 4 days in a row day and night shifts back to back, which she knows. All I wanted to do was sleep. I texted her asking what we can do to get them to leave. She responds with “nothing you’re just being dramatic.” Obviously I’m agitated by this, so I jokingly said “Would it be wrong if I called the cops lol?” To try and release some tension because I cannot handle a fight right now. She said I was being a big baby about the whole situation and that I was throwing a tantrum. All I want is adequate sleep and some peace and quiet. I can’t do that when there are strangers all over my house and land being as obnoxious as possible. So am I the asshole in this case?

104,1dmjhmq,AITA For not giving ‘back’ what was given to me? ,"First time poster, apologies if the formatting or anything isn’t as what’s normal! 

For context, I (F22), have a younger sister (F18) & two younger brothers (M20/M15). We moved from our birth country when I was 13, sister was 9. All our grandparents are still in our birth country & we try and go back every two years, but… ya know, COVID happened & inflation. 

My mother and sister went back to our birth country in 2022 to visit my grandparents (mother’s parents), after not being back since 2018. As is life, they are getting quite old and they were sorting through stuff they didn’t want (jewellery, other sentimental family items etc, nothing expensive) 

My grandma let my sister (F16 at the time) go through her jewellery and let her take anything she wanted, which my sister did. She got some family heirlooms, aswell as other pieces. My grandma also gave my mother a necklace and a bracelet to take back for me, which they did. 

Fast forward to about a month ago (over 2 years later), we were sorting through rooms etc having a deep clean and I came across the necklace and the bracelet my grandma had sent back with my mum and sister. My sister saw it and asked “is that what we brought back for you from grandma?” And I said yes. She said they are nice pieces and I agreed, and that was that. 

Fast forward to today, my sister starts screaming at me out of the blue, saying I ‘stole’ them (necklace/bracelet) from her. Mind you, these are not expensive/fancy items or anything extravagant, nor are they family heirlooms, just standard silver jewellery my grandma purchased. She claims that grandma gave them to her, and mum shouldn’t have given them to me. At the time when they were given to me, I confirmed with both my mother and sister that they were for me, and that they didn’t want them. They said that they were for me & they didn’t want them. 

Currently, I am fighting with my mother and sister over the bracelet and necklace as they both said it was for me from my grandma. Their reasoning is that because my sister went over & they brought it back, my sister should now have them…. Even though they brought it back for me.

They are also saying because I am going back soon to see grandma, that I should give it ‘back’ to my sister because I can choose other items while I am there. My sister also claims that those two items I have are all she has from grandma, even though she came back with some other very important family heirlooms? 

I understand that this is an almost frivolous thing to be upset and fight about, and may come across as very entitled. I am aware of all the awful things going on in the world, and how small of an issue this is in the grand scheme of things. 

So, AITA for not wanting to give ‘back’ to my sister what they brought back for me?

107,1dmjaz6,AITA for not being grateful over what I got for my birthday,"Hi, I just turned 18 today and I feel like I am justified with how I feel but I got called an asshole for this earlier on by a relative.

So today I woke up feeling pretty excited given my parents had been hyping up my 18th, talking about how it was going to be great and how they had put alot of thought into everything. They had been doing this for months now and I mean that literally, my dad had even asked me for a list of music artists and books i was looking for and claimed not to ask why because i had my birthday coming up. Ontop of that, they know i'm a big space need and love spiderman and sharks and i also have a switch and mentioned a few pretty cheap video games i wanted to try. Yet when I saw what I got I realised that all the Amazon packages i had seen come the day beflre(and i know these where only ordered on the Friday as we have next day delivery with my mums account) was what she had ordered for my gifts

Let me start by saying that its not that im ungrateful for the fact they got me things. No its the fact they put no thought into it. For a reference point, my brother back when he had turned 18 had recieved a major games console at the time and over £100 worth of games. And yet i recieved a tacky t-shirt with the graphic pealing, a broken bookmark and a mug that looks like the picture will peel off with one wash and an 'emotional support pickle' crochet thing of Temu. Might i add these things all have the exact same phrase ""omg im an adult now"" which i expressed i usually dont like on multiple occassions at past birthdays.

My mum seemed really proud of herself and I felt like shit thinking about how much i hate it all so I couldn't bring myself to say anything. I don't even know what was going through her mind really when she decided to get stuff the day before that she knows I wouldn't enjoy. And I know she's been stressed recently because of the fact we've been getting building work done in the house. But the thing is I know money isn't the problem because she just got herself and my dad two VIP tickets to go see Green Day on Tuesday and stay at a fancy hotel there.

I told one of my cousins about it and they said i was being an ungrateful brat about it and that i should just suck it up because theres people out there who wouldn't even have gotten anything for their birthday. She ended up telling my parents and it made them really upset and made them cry.

I see him then open up Instagram, so I reach over and grab his phone out of his hand. He fights me a bit over it and then drops his phone, and he’s visibly upset about it. I reiterate my point about not being on his phone and he stays silent. We get our snacks, and go back into the car to head home. He gets on the road and opens his phone again to turn on some music while driving. At this point I get a bit upset about it, but decide that asking him wouldn’t work anymore considering his initial reaction. So, while he’s looking down at his phone, I yell “AHHHHH” as if there was something in front of us that he wasn’t paying attention too. He stays silent for a few seconds and starts screaming at me. He’s extremely mad and in the middle of screaming at me, I’m reiterating my point of not being on the phone while driving. 

We get back to his place, he storms inside and slams the door. He goes upstairs without saying a word to me and I’m left downstairs. I hear him slamming and hitting stuff upstairs, so I don’t confront him and instead text him asking if he’d like to talk. I don’t get a response but he comes downstairs a bit later visibly upset. He throws a pillow at me and then we start talking, with me being very calm and him being very angry. He claims that by doing what I did (the “AHHHHH”), I put us in more danger and risked our lives (this is a point I partially agree with and apologized for later on). I gave my perspective, which was that I did the only thing I could think of to get him off his phone. I found it rude, disrespectful, and inconsiderate that he was on it and disregarding myself and other drivers, after asking multiple times. He didn’t take my perspective into much consideration, as he would constantly interrupt me, tell me not to lecture him, tell me he can do what he wants, mention that he was only doing it the second time so that he could put a song on, and yelling things like “I don’t care” with him reiterating his own perspective while taking out his anger. towards the end, he said a comment about how I was sitting so “calmly and deadfaced”, as i'm guessing it bothered him.

111,1dmivww,AITA for spending half my lunchbreak outside and leaving work for my coworkers?,"English is not my first language.

I (19F) am a licenced hairdresser. We only have one student in the salon, Student (18M).

Student thinks that I have to do ALL the cleaning, because I am his age and a woman, so he leaves things for me to clean up. He even does it on days when I am not there with the idea that I will do it tomorrow or on days where I am fully booked, bc he ""doesn't have time to do it"" or something.

With other coworkers, he'll also refuse to do work, but only when my boss is not around and he'll turn everything into a discussion until someone gets mad, then he looks at you surprised, bc he doesn't understand that he is being infuriating.

Student laughs everything off and somehow never understands when he's to blame and tries to blame it on someone else.

I have once in anger said that I can't wait for his contract to end and that I get sick and tired of dealing with him, which wasn't nice, but he brings out the worst in me.

Everyone has had fights with him about many things. Boss has already told him that she isn't going to renew his contract, which resulted in Student doing even less.

Here is where I may be TA:

During lunch, I am the only one who picks up the phone or greets costumers, bc everyone thinks that Student should do it, so they don't do it. Student isn't going to, bc ""he's on break"", just like all of us. So that means I have to interrupt my break atleast 7 times a day, while also doing his work majority of the day.

I am overworked, hangry and overstimulated at that point, so I decided to go outside, so I can cool off and that I'll come back to eat when Student's break is over. If I am not there, I can't do the work right?  
My coworkers understand what I mean, but they don't like that they have to argue or interupt their own break, so would prefer if I came back inside. They are also concerned that I am waiting longer to eat, but I am simply not in the mood for him when I am eating.

I have once in anger said that I can't wait for his contract to end and that I get sick and tired of dealing with him, which wasn't nice, but he brings out the worst in me.

Everyone has had fights with him about many things. Boss has already told him that she isn't going to renew his contract, which resulted in Student doing even less.

Here is where I may be TA:

During lunch, I am the only one who picks up the phone or greets costumers, bc everyone thinks that Student should do it, so they don't do it. Student isn't going to, bc ""he's on break"", just like all of us. So that means I have to interrupt my break atleast 7 times a day, while also doing his work majority of the day.

I am overworked, hangry and overstimulated at that point, so I decided to go outside, so I can cool off and that I'll come back to eat when Student's break is over. If I am not there, I can't do the work right?  
My coworkers understand what I mean, but they don't like that they have to argue or interupt their own break, so would prefer if I came back inside. They are also concerned that I am waiting longer to eat, but I am simply not in the mood for him when I am eating.

I'm a 20-year-old closeted gay man, working with a coworker, Josh (19). We met in freshman year, but became close friends in sophomore year while working together. Josh would often flirt with his guy friends in a joking way, but started doing it with me too. At first, I thought it was just jokes, but it made me uncomfortable because I found it attractive. I've struggled with feeling undesirable, and Josh's attention confused me. I didn't think he knew I was gay, and if I told him, it could put our friendship and my job at risk. We work for a conservative Christian organization, and being outed could jeopardize my scholarship.

Josh's joking became more intense, making me feel trapped. He'd lift me onto a countertop, tease me about wanting me in his bed, and even jokingly would touch my butt. I laughed it off nervously, but deep down, I wanted it to stop. When he started dating a girl, I thought his actions would stop, but they didn't. Eventually, he proposed to her, and we're still working together. The jokes persisted, and I finally worked up the courage to tell him to stop. He said I sometimes joked back, but I told him I didn't think we should.

On a work trip, he insisted we share a bed, and he made more jokes. I felt conflicted and disoriented. Later that night, I felt him nudging my back and putting his hand on my hip while I was sleeping. I didn't sleep, telling myself it was just his sleep movements or that he has a fiancée.

117,1dmhpft,AITA for trading $50 in silver coins for $1?,"I work at a gas station/convenience store that is pretty busy.  My job requires me to handle a lot of coins on a daily basis, both from customers and rolled coins from the bank.  On the side, I collect (more like hoard) old coins.  Nothing crazy like looking for mistakes, just old ones.  I have a particular affinity for all silver coins.  My employer is fine with me practicing my hobby provided I pay face value of each coin to the store.  Ya know, an even trade.

So, a lady came in not too long ago and made a purchase.  She paid close to exact change which included one 1964 Quarter (silver) which I clocked immediately.  I accepted it without a word.  I then glanced up at her hand holding all of her remaining coins and noticed more silver quarters.  So, I asked her if she wanted to trade a dollar's worth of coins for a dollar bill.  Without hesitation, she gathered up 4 more silver quarters and traded them for the bill.  Later, once she had gone, I used my own money to purchase the $1.25 in coins from the till.

But I am starting to feel bad, though.  She obviously didn't know what she had or else she wouldn't have spent them for face value. My coworkers say “her loss is your gain” and “she should have known.  It's not your (my) fault she didn't know.” But I also purposefully withheld the info I had and offered a trade that was heavily stacked in my favor.  Should I have tried to tell her what she had and what it could be worth, or is this just “The Art of the Deal”?

Quarter years and approx. value for those interested:

I excelled throughout high school and my first year of college, achieving a high GPA with other extracurriculars I'm passionate about.

On the other hand, my friend tends to struggle in school and doesn't come from a family with nearly as much privilege money-wise.

I told him to take AP biology his senior year, but he said he wanted to have an easy last year, and I pushed it no further.

Nonetheless, he remains committed to becoming a dentist by spending more time at my parents' dental office than I have through our high school dental program, which I chose not to do. His ambition is clear despite his struggles.

A couple of weeks ago, he told me excitedly that he thought he would apply to dental school in 2 years, just like I did. However, this had him taking more online and summer classes than regular classes and not factoring in all the dental school prerequisites. This also had him taking many difficult classes together (organic, cell biology, physics). I never try to put him down for his lack of academic success, but I worry for him as his college days come. I recently watched him struggle with basic algebra in his math placement test. I tried to help him through each question, but he still was extremely confused. That night, I told him he was unlikely to apply to dental school in two years. I explained that he should take classes to prepare for the prerequisite classes given by the dental school or take only one hard class in his first one or two semesters. I also told him it would be beneficial to choose safety, which he did (exercise science). Although he took all my advice, he told me he felt like he was screwed. I told him he wasn't and that if he put in enough effort, he could do it, but my affirmations did not help. I feel at fault for putting doubt in his head.

120,1dmhbkq,AITA for calling out my alcoholic father in front of the whole family?,"
I (18F) have been dealing with my father's alcoholism for years. It's caused me a lot of pain and trauma. 
My dad gets drunk every day and gives my mom a hard time, i can’t help but feel angry about the life my mom is living because of my dad. he doesn’t have a steady job,and the little amount he does earn is wasted on alcohol. mom is always paying for everything, she works day and night to earn as much as she can to provide for me and my brother all because my dad is too lazy to look for a steady job with an average income. 
It has gotten so bad that this situation is now up in everyones business, my aunt once took me out to lunch just to talk to me about this situation, she told me how she feels extremely helpless for my mom. we talked for over 2 hours and i had to stop myself from breaking down in front of her. 
Everyone in my family is aware of this situation but they always tiptoe around the issue to avoid confrontation. I think none of them really care enough to try to salvage the situation. I myself have tried talking to my dad, cried in front of him to stop drinking and get a proper job to help mom out. I tried to make him understand that he has a wife and two kids whose lives he’s actively ruining with his lifestyle. But my pleas always fall on deaf ears.  i genuinely think i might slip into depression due to the financial stress and my dad’s existence, i cant even imagine what my mom might be going through. 

Recently, on a sunday we were all eating lunch and watching a show that we all like on the tv.

( the only people in the room were me, my brother, my parents and my grandmother) 

 My father barged in, took the remote from me and put on something he liked and started watching. 

I told him that we were watching that show and that he can watch his in 10 minutes as ours was nearing its end.
He started arguing and slurring his words as he was drunk and that was it, i don’t know why but i lost my shit.
I put my food aside and started shouting at him, it felt like a dam had burst. I told him how he failed as a father and a husband, i told him that he’s ruining my life and how i wished i had a better father. 
I started to cry while screaming at him.
i screamed at him for a good 15 minutes, i wanted my words to hurt. Everyone in the room was silent, my mom was crying but to my surprise my dad was STILL WATCHING THE SHOW. When i was done shouting, he simply told me to move aside so that he can peacefully watch his show.

After the painful realisation that he didn’t care about his family, we simply left the room to go eat somewhere else. 
This happened five days ago and my dad has just gone silent. I don’t know why i was hoping for him to come around and apologise.
Since then, my grandmother has not been talking to me and she gives me dirty looks when we’re in the same room.

My dad gets drunk every day and gives my mom a hard time, i can’t help but feel angry about the life my mom is living because of my dad. he doesn’t have a steady job,and the little amount he does earn is wasted on alcohol. mom is always paying for everything, she works day and night to earn as much as she can to provide for me and my brother all because my dad is too lazy to look for a steady job with an average income. 
It has gotten so bad that this situation is now up in everyones business, my aunt once took me out to lunch just to talk to me about this situation, she told me how she feels extremely helpless for my mom. we talked for over 2 hours and i had to stop myself from breaking down in front of her. 
Everyone in my family is aware of this situation but they always tiptoe around the issue to avoid confrontation. I think none of them really care enough to try to salvage the situation. I myself have tried talking to my dad, cried in front of him to stop drinking and get a proper job to help mom out. I tried to make him understand that he has a wife and two kids whose lives he’s actively ruining with his lifestyle. But my pleas always fall on deaf ears.  i genuinely think i might slip into depression due to the financial stress and my dad’s existence, i cant even imagine what my mom might be going through. 

Recently, on a sunday we were all eating lunch and watching a show that we all like on the tv.

( the only people in the room were me, my brother, my parents and my grandmother) 

 My father barged in, took the remote from me and put on something he liked and started watching. 

I told him that we were watching that show and that he can watch his in 10 minutes as ours was nearing its end.
He started arguing and slurring his words as he was drunk and that was it, i don’t know why but i lost my shit.
I put my food aside and started shouting at him, it felt like a dam had burst. I told him how he failed as a father and a husband, i told him that he’s ruining my life and how i wished i had a better father. 
I started to cry while screaming at him.
i screamed at him for a good 15 minutes, i wanted my words to hurt. Everyone in the room was silent, my mom was crying but to my surprise my dad was STILL WATCHING THE SHOW. When i was done shouting, he simply told me to move aside so that he can peacefully watch his show.

After the painful realisation that he didn’t care about his family, we simply left the room to go eat somewhere else. 
This happened five days ago and my dad has just gone silent. I don’t know why i was hoping for him to come around and apologise.
Since then, my grandmother has not been talking to me and she gives me dirty looks when we’re in the same room.

122,1dmh0js,AITA for Making My Daughter Apologize to Her Teacher for a Disrespectful Comment?,"Last week, my (43M) daughter (15F) came home from school and told me about an incident that happened in her history class. Her teacher, Ms. Smith, is known for being strict but fair. During a discussion on cultural history, Ms. Smith mentioned some important contributions from various cultures. My daughter, trying to be funny in front of her friends, said, ""Well, at least our culture isn't stuck in the sand like some others,"" with a smirk. Ms. Smith, who is of Middle Eastern descent, clearly heard the comment and was visibly upset but continued with the lesson.

When my daughter recounted the incident to me, she seemed to think it was no big deal. I was mortified and told her that such disrespectful and ignorant comments were unacceptable. My daughter brushed it off, saying it was just a joke and that Ms. Smith was overreacting.

I decided that my daughter needed to understand the impact of her words. That evening, I made her write a sincere apology letter to Ms. Smith. I also required her to write a two-page paper: one page on the contributions of Middle Eastern cultures to history and another on the impact of disrespectful comments in a classroom setting. The next day, I took her to school early so she could personally deliver the apology letter and papers to Ms. Smith.

Ms. Smith was very appreciative of the apology and thanked my daughter for taking responsibility. She also shared with my daughter how such comments can perpetuate stereotypes and create a hostile learning environment. My daughter seemed to genuinely understand the gravity of her actions after this conversation.

However, when I discussed this with my wife (55F) that evening, she thought I had gone overboard. She said that it was just a teenage joke and that making our daughter write the papers and apologize in person was too extreme. She believes kids make mistakes and that this punishment was too harsh and humiliating for her.

To start for context of the story, I am a thirteen year old girl who is the oldest child in her family. My parents are both in their mid to late thirties and have treated me and my siblings well our entire life. I have always been told that I am the person who made my father a father, and that that was something no one else could say.

Well new information has come to light up the truth.

When my dad was eighteen he was in a toxic relationship with his girlfriend and had drunken sex. A while after this, he learned that he had a child, who at the time, was three months old. My father, who was now dating my mother, tried to get custody by my brother's adoption had already gone through, and nothing could be done.

Fast forward three to four years, I am born. 

I have lived a very happy life as the oldest child, but have just learned that one of the things that shaped my very identity, being the oldest child and being my parents first child, was a lie. My mom and dad have been constantly reminding me that this doesn't effect me very much, because he is seventeen and lives several hours away, but it still forces me to feel lied to.

I do appreciate that they waited to tell me, for when I was a child I had severe anxiety and most likely would have driven myself into a panic attack with the information, but they still thought, and didn't trust me enough, even when I was older. I do have three younger siblings, but all are mature for their age and always process information very well, and always have.

Is it wrong for me to feel lied to, or upset?

I have this great new thing, an older brother who seems to want to have a relationship with me, but I am unsure. Not in him. But in my parents. Is it wrong for my faith in them to be shaken?

But I do not see her as my mother or as a mother figure in my life. She sees herself as my mother though. She also sees herself as my older sister's (30f) mother. When my sister got married she didn't list dad's wife at all and just mentioned our parents (mom was listed as *the late, name).* I'm okay with listing her out of politeness and mostly for my dad. But she's not mother of the groom and I do not want her as that. This is causing a stir though because she said she will be the only one capable of filling that role when I actually get married. And she said she feels she has been around long enough and good enough to us for her to be listed as such.

She was never really bad to us, just really annoying and pushy about us being ""her kids"" and her being ""our mom"". Dad did step in and correct her a few times and stick up for us but he never did enough so she has always expected to be acknowledged as our mom. Though she never asked us to stop talking about mom. She just wants to be acknowledged the same as mom and has told us it's even more possible when she's alive and mom passed already.

I put my foot down and told her she will not be listed as mother of the groom. She told me I'm being needlessly difficult and asked why I can so easily disrespect her. I told her she is not and has never been my mother and while she is my stepmother, the step would never be dropped by me. She told me I was behaving like a child still and I should be thrilled she's fighting for us. Then she claimed I was pushing her away and would be stealing my future children's chance to have a grandmother just like my sister has (my nieces and nephews call our dad's wife by her name or say she's grandpa wife, not grandma).

129,1dmg6mx,WIBTA If I agreed to be my sister's Maid of Honor?,"My (21F) sister (24F) just asked me to be her maid of honor at her wedding next year.

The problem is that I hate her fiance. I hate him for a lot of reasons—first, he met my sister when she was seventeen and he was twenty-five, and waited to start dating her until she was very, very freshly eighteen. He actively encourages her eating disorder.

Also, my sister has a well-paying job as a nurse, and her fiance is a college dropout who keeps changing between minimum-wage jobs at various fast-food places. He says he wants to be a professional photographer, but he is both very bad and completely unwilling to practice. He chose where their apartment is (a pretty sketchy part of the city) because ""its all he can afford"" but my sister pays half the rent and all of the bills, and covers his half of the rent sometimes when he's out of a job. I don't like her living in that part of the city.

He has been very disrespectful of me when I've met him: I am allergic to certain nuts and he keeps bringing food with those nuts to family gatherings and cross-contaminates the food I can eat. When I was staying at my parents' house recently, he locked our (elderly) family dog in my childhood bedroom because he ""doesn't like her"" and when she peed on my rug, he laughed and told my sister that he ""hoped she would do that.""

Also, frivilously, I think the instagram captions he posts are incredibly cringey. He posts black and white photos of him with captions like ""wherever i'm at, i'm adding value"" and ""focused and furious"" and ""silent moves private milestones"" and other stupid stuff like that.

Anyway, I know if I were maid of honor I'd have to give a speech. Honestly, I don't know if I could give a complimentary speech about this guy and their relationship. Knowing this, would I be the asshole if I accepted the position of maid of honor anyway, to support my sister?",No A-holes here,2024-06-23,"WIBTA If I agreed to be my sister's Maid of Honor?

132,1dmfvl0,AITA for not giving my son a present at his birthday party?,"My (47M) son (5M) had a birthday party last Saturday. At the school my son attends, it is traditional for parents to throw their children birthday parties. The kids invite their school friends to these parties, they participate in contests and play games, eat pizza, etc.   
I never had a problem with this, although before my son went to this school, we used to celebrate his birthday at home. So, let's get to the heart of the conflict. 

My wife organized a traditional birthday party for my son, he invited his school friends, his siblings (7M, 8F) were naturally included. 

Since most of the work of organizing the party was taken care of by my wife, I had to play the role of a toastmaster of sorts at the party. 

Among all the other things was a contest in which the kids had to run at speed to the other end of the yard and collect plastic fruits and vegetables in a basket. The reward was candy, which my son loves very much. This little prize was supposed to go to all the kids in the end, because I thought they could all handle ""vegetable picking."" 

My son is a really good runner, but two things happened at once. First, just ten minutes before this competition, he twisted his leg while jumping on the trampoline. Nothing too serious, but he limped for about five minutes and then said he was fine. Second, as he was running back with his full basket, he tripped and fell. All the vegetables scattered on the ground, he picked them back up and ran back to the start, but he ran out of time.  

So, the contest was over and I started handing out candy to all the kids. My son reached out for a candy too, but I tried to be as friendly as possible and told him that he didn't make it to the timer. He looked very upset and after that he didn't have as much fun at the party anymore. 

After the party, we had an argument with my wife. I said that children should be taught responsibility from a young age. Yes, it wasn't my son's fault that he tripped and fell, but he still didn't make it, why should I make an exception and give him a present? My wife said: ""Because he's only 5 years old and he had a birthday party!"". She and I barely speak after that. 

I told my friends what happened and some took my side and some took my wife's side. My father tooky side, and myom took my wife's side

I only come home for the summers but when I do, I tend to work 2 jobs and have summer classes so my schedule is always a lot. Over the years, I have asked my dad to teach me to drive. However, when I ask him if he has time over the week, he would say he wasn’t sure and that we’d figure it out when the day came. Sometimes I asked him the day of but he would say he would see how he felt later. I recognize that I also didn’t push and initiate these lessons has much as I should’ve but I didn’t feel comfortable enough too because I tend to work on his time and he doesn’t work with mine.

For a bit of backstory basically I'm a lesbian and for a LONG time I didnt want kids. I was wholeheartedly against the idea due to health risks, money, and my ever changing mental state. And I had said if I ever wanted kids, they would be adopted. My mom knew all of this ever since I was in my early teens. Unfortunately, this added to her saltiness towards me preferring girls for the last decade. There were constant comments about God, finding the right man, the possibility of it being a phase, etc. The last couple of years she's slowed down with these comments and \*seems\* to have accepted that. Going as far as to not expect grandkids from me at all. As far as my dad goes, he's not happy but he's content with the idea I won't have any accidental pregnancies.

Now here's the problem. I changed my mind when I met my girlfriend four years ago. My parents have no idea I'm dating this woman and my girlfriend is perfectly okay with that for safety reasons. Anyway, when I met my girlfriend about a year in we made each of our intentions for a relationship clear and one of the top ones was marriage and kids. It honestly felt like true love and I had decided then and there I wanted a full cliche life with her. At the time we had decided we wanted to adopt 3 children. My parents don't even think I want more than 1 which I do feel a little bad for.

Of course as time passed I just recently decided that with new developments in science, I wanted to give my girlfriend children myself. Even if I'm only able to handle having just one, it ended up being something I want to do. Again my parents don't know any of this. And although I'm 23, I still live under their roof as I go to college and they sometimes provide financial help. On top of that, it was my moms little dream/idea that I have children and have a husband. 

I spoke to a friend about this.

A month goes by and everything is fine and going well. The next month I see on the schedule that she had put me towards the end of the month six days in a row. I was confused by that honestly so I tried to talk to her and she says it's because I need to cover for people even though we had full time workers wanting extra hours. I went ahead and finished that month and the next months schedule came out and again towards the end of the month 6 days in a row. I had also sent in a time off request from to take a few days off the next month a whole month early. She comes up to me while during a busy rush and says to me "" I can't give you any days off next month."" To which I said ""why am I working full time hours?"" She said ""cuz I need you to cover."" Then just walked off. I tried and tried to talk to her about the hours and me being part time to no avail, I got fed up and I called during a night shift and told whoever was on duty that I quit and explained why and they agreed that she shouldn't have scheduled me that much. Now I've been hearing that I was a no call no show even though I called to say I quit. I was just wondering AITA for quitting?",0.0,0.0007648004684597254,0,1
137,1dmfaso,AITA for Playing a Part in My Neighbors' Eviction,"So I have a neighbor who moved in about 2 months ago.  He is LOUD.  I'm talking music at all hours, loud phone calls to where I can hear every word that is said, and playing video games online to where I hear him screaming obscenities 4-5x per week.  I complained to management one time about a month ago (when he was playing music at 4 AM that woke me up) but otherwise haven't said anything aside from the occasional stomp on the floor (he lives below me) when it is after 10 PM (my building's quiet hours).

Fast forward to Friday.  I am on a conference call in my living room (I WFH part of the week) when I get a knock on my door; I look through the keyhole and it's my neighbor.  I am at first confused as to why he is knocking on my door, as I haven't made any formal complaints in a month.  I later found out that I am not the only one that has complained about him, so maybe he assumes it's all me.  As I am on a work call, I don't answer the door.  After knocking 4-5 times, I move into my bedroom and shut the door because other people on the call can hear him knocking.

If he had left then, that would have been the end of it IMO. However, he then proceeds to go outside into the courtyard (my apartment faces an internal courtyard area), look into my open blinds (because I am now in my bedroom, I can see him but he cannot see me; he is looking into the open blinds of my living room where my work desk is) and I hear him say something to the effect of ""Oh, now you won't come outside?  Ok then.""

I don't feel threatened by this necessarily, but it was enough to make me uncomfortable.  Today, I go tell my property manager about this behavior.  She doesn't give me any details but essentially says that I am not the only one who has complained about this guy and that their lawyers are getting involved Monday morning to begin the eviction process.  I don't know anything about this guy or his circumstances, and I don't think being a noisy asshole is enough for an eviction.  But him increasing the confrontation by staring into my windows plus confirmation form my property manager that I am not the only one to have issues does make me feel a little better about it.

138,1dmf79x,WIBTA for speaking up for my best friend,"My best friend (F 20's) was recently invited to an acquaintance's wedding. I was not invited as I am not as close to the couple but at least know the groom as we all went to the same school. Anyways, Friend is not close to the future bride and only talks to the groom occasionally, but the rest of Friend's entire family is close to the groom, meaning her entire family was invited to this wedding. 

The wedding invitation was sent to her with an RSVP date in November with the wedding set in February. Friend also recently quit her job so employment is a little rocky so that means finances are also not solidified. A lot can change by February and especially by November so she was planning on responding closer to November by the set date. 

Groom spoke to Friend about when she was going to RSVP. Friend was able to wave off the conversation   but eventually felt very pressured when he kept asking every week why she hasn't RSVP-ed yet and did so on the spot checking YES to get him to stop asking. She seems to slightly regret that choice as it was done out of urgency.

She does not want to admit to Groom that she does not want to attend to the wedding as she does not want to upset her family that is attending or disrespect the couple but she still feels uneasy that she now has to attend a wedding she doesn't want to go to. 

She has confronted the groom stating that she was uncomfortable with him pressuring her to RSVP before she was ready and asked why he was so adamant when she had until November. His only response was ""it's for headcount. Commit to the wedding"".  She rephrased that she still had until November, so why the rush and pressure from her, and he is yet to respond. 

Since I was not invited, I advised her to just make up an excuse that she was busy with me and couldn't attend the wedding to shift more of the blame away from her in any way. Friend still feels obligated now to attend the wedding, play social politics, and doesn't know how to go about it. 

WIBTA if I confronted the groom myself about how he made her feel very pressured and how that was not an ok thing to do? That he needs to work things out and listen to Friend when she is being upfront about how she feels about her whole situation.

Context for the title - My father has 2 biological kids, Me(17F) and my Brother(29M). My parents are divorced so I also have 4 other half siblings who use to consider my dad theirs until falling out. My dad since my brother turned 18 has fully paid for all of his expenses. Housing, Food, Entertainment, etc. My brother has never had a job, had a higher education, or even driven a car. Even recently got my brother his own apartment where he will continue to pay for everything. 

  
My father has a high paying job so he pays about 1.4K in child support, so recently I asked him that when I go to University if he could instead send that 1.4K or part of it to me to help me pay for expenses. His response was that he ""would not be paying for a grown adults life for the next 10 years when they could do it themselves."" I chose to remind him that he to this day pays for a grown adult's life, which apparently was the wrong response as he left me on read.

  
He then apparently called one of my sister's to let her know he would not be attending my nephew's birthday party tomorrow, and not send a gift anymore because I made him feel ""unwelcomed"". My sister was super pissed off about this and told me, and was mad at both me and him. She said I should have waited for a better time to talk about this instead of mess up her kid's day, which I wasn't exactly expecting my dad to bail on his grandkid due to this.

  
I've already had other people contact me, including my dad's girlfriend, telling me I could have waited, been nicer, that I was greedy to expect money from someone, and even called ungrateful. Usually I wouldn't of cared but I also can understand it's considered taboo already to ask someone for money or question how they choose to spend it. I don't think my dad's response was in any way my fault but I also am now unsure if it was appropriate for me to even ask someone for money and expect it in the first place because in no way was I entitled to it.

A woman (40ish) came and stood in the space on the left, facing with her butt practically in my face, followed by husband (40ish) and daughter (10ish) who stood at the end of the bench. They ate and talked for a minute before asking me to move down for them.

141,1dmexcq,AITA for expressing my disappointment my partner wasn’t home to greet me after a week long trip?,"Today I (30) came home from a week long trip to my partner (31) gone from our apartment. We'd been texting throughout the day and I had let them know I was boarding my final flight headed home with a rough estimate on when I'd likely be home. Shortly after I put my phone on airplane mode they let me know ""going to a friend's party be back soon"". Once the flight landed 45 minutes later I let them know I'd landed which is when I saw their text telling me they'd left. I'd carpooled with some friends so I let my partner know again when we were close to my friends place where my car was and they responded letting me know they saw my text and they are aware of approximately how far my friend lives from our place. Finally when I got into my car I sent them another text saying I was ~30 minutes from home which they replied ""yay!"" to. 
When I got home I was greeted by the cats but my partner was nowhere to be seen and after loving on our cats I sent them a text saying ""I'm going to be honest I'm a little hurt you're not home."" They responded ""damn I'm still at the party"" and I said I understood that and I'd interpreted be home soon to imply they'd be back before I would get home and I'd gotten my own hopes up. We try to be transparent with our feelings and I understand this text comes off as passive aggressive and sent it in a moment of feeling upset and during our exchanges today it was never clearly stated that I'd like them home at a specific time to greet me. 
We've been together about 2 years now and this is the first time we've had this much time apart so this is new territory to us to navigate. A little over an hour later (their friend lives 20ish minutes away) my partner got home we hugged and I tried to explain to them why I sent them the text and brought my feelings up trying to let them know how I felt in that moment and that in the future if when either of us got home from a trip it would mean a lot to me if we could be home to greet one another. They said I was an asshole for sending them that text and that I'd never let them know exactly when I'd be home. I let them know before I left for my trip roughly when I'd be home and we'd been texting all day/week how much we missed one another and I expressed I wanted nothing more than to hug them and the cats when I got home. 
My partner is telling me my expectations were unfounded today, which I will admit I did not directly express that I wanted them to greet me when I got home, but they also say that asking for this in the future makes me an asshole since it's too controlling and not taking their emotions and wants into account. I understand they are their own person, but I also don't think asking for them to be home to reunite with each other first thing is unreasonable since I might go on a trip like this maybe 2x a year if that. They also state I'm the one more likely to leave for a trip so it's a very one sided request. 
I'm worried I'm not seeing something, so I'm asking am I the asshole for being upset they weren't home when I got back from my trip and their reaction to be asking they try to do so in the future?

142,1dmesg8,AITA for telling my friend her people pleasing wasn’t my problem?,"
This is not at all a dig on people who are people pleasers (though I do think y’all should do some self introspection, preferably with a therapist to figure out why). However, when you try to make your people pleasing MY issue, that’s where you’re gonna get push back… even if it’s brash.

My friends Stacy, Cara and I (all 30s) were riding together to a group dinner. Stacy’s bf agreed to drive us. Stacy’s bf is a terrible driver (something I did not know before getting in the car). Swerving in lanes, slamming  speeding. I asked him to slow down at one point and was told that this was his car and he would drive the way he wants. Fine. We got to the restaurant. 

Towards the end Stacy let us know that she would talk to her boyfriend about driving better. I told her that I will just take an Uber home. She did seem a little taken aback, but ultimately didn’t respond. I went to the restroom. Cara followed me and asked if I would just get into the car with them because she felt uncomfortable too but “it’ll be ok.” And I told her that she should just Uber back with me. Apparently Stacy texted her about me being rude to decline a free ride. I told Cara I care more about my safety than being perceived as rude for not getting into a car with a makeshift Dom Toretto wannabe. Again I offered that she could just come Uber with me (cost was not an issue for either of us). There was some back and forth with her trying to convince me to let great value baby driver cart us back but I wasn’t budging. Ultimately I told her she could do whatever she wanted, but so could I. That (albeit nice) car wouldn’t see me. 

I took an Uber. Everyone got home safely thank goodness. Then I get a somewhat long text from Cara saying that she was disappointed in me for not having her back. And that I know that she has difficulty saying no to people sometimes and that I should’ve just hung with her because she also was uncomfortable and also concerned about her safety. That I knew she is a people pleaser and she’s working on it but needs support.  I’m not gonna lie I was kind of over the whole thing. And this is not the first time Cara has had difficulty standing up for herself and trying to corral someone else to “just go with the flow” so perhaps that is why I was a bit short with her? Either way I told her that her people pleasing tendencies are not my problem and I’m not gonna be uncomfortable alongside her just because she doesn’t have the mental wherewithal to say “no.” She didn’t respond. 

Honestly writing this out, makes this whole thing seem even sillier to me! How are you worried about your safety but willingly doing that unsafe thing?!! The only reason I’m here is because our other friend CC said that I might get some different opinions. CC agrees with me but wonders if we’re just too harsh lol. 

Again, please don’t dog on people pleasers! It ain’t my ministry but I’m sure some people are working through it.

I have tried explaining to my parents that I am much older and how they need to teach her that there will be differences in our lifestyles. 

Some context: 

Once I was on the train with my sister and mom and my sister began crying because my mom wouldn't let her use the phone while I had mine. I let out a small laugh and my mom hit me hard on my back. I just stood up and walked away. Later I could see my sister smiling as she had my mom's phone in her hands. 

There have been so many instances where my sister has hit me and I have many scars from her scratching me. The worst part is: that I can't fight back, or else my parents get mad at me for ""hitting a child"". They always tell me to just tell them, but when I do, they tell me that they've ""taken care of it"" but their definition of that is just telling her how wrong it is and expecting her to not do it again. (SHOCKER: It always happens again.) She's grown up so entitled and knows that whenever she cries or screams she will get what she wants. 



And before anyone says: Well she's just a child, they get off with lighter punishments, I  remember being punished both physically and mentally when I was her age or around that age by my parents while they have never laid a single finger on her since she was born. I don't encourage hitting children at all. I just want her to be held accountable, but I struggle to understand why she is treated differently. I've talked to my parents before but they always dismiss me citing that I'm older and need to be patient with her and be the ""mature one"". 



Earlier today, my mother, sister, and I were all getting ready to go out when my sister started teasing me about how I was putting on makeup and making us late(we had 30 minutes). I told her to stop and that it was annoying me. My mother then started about how if one of us did something bad, both of us would be hit as a punishment. I told her that that was completely irrational and how much it upset me that she would say something like this. I knew she would never hit my sister and to please stop. She kept laughing and I asked if she was serious to which she said yes. I feel like the years of resentment just all exploded out and I began screaming at her. I said that I couldn't control her and that was why I would be punished? She then got mad at me saying that it would motivate us to be ""better kids"". She doubled down saying that I was my sister's role model and that most of the bad things she has done she probably learned from me. (Because I've totally laid hands on my parents and thrown drinks at people while crying in stores!) 

Looking back on it, it was such a small thing and she was probably joking, but I just can't understand why they refuse to hold my sister accountable for the things she does while I get punished for the smallest things.

144,1dmeniq,AITA for sending a letter to my neighbour?,"Me, my mum, two nephews, BIL, the neighbour (Ella, fake name) and her son went to Center Parcs Woburn in February this year. We found a treehouse which is normally £10k we found it for £3k. The whole holiday was a disaster. Nothing worked and were getting electrocuted. We made the holiday work since we wouldn’t be able to do it again, we’re not rich. Keep in mind I gave Ella my email and password for music on holiday. 

Now to the problem after the holiday I found out Ella done Coca-Cola on Christmas, slept with her abusive ex and got pregnant. She lied to me about it which wouldn’t be a problem if she spoke about it, but she blocked both me and mum straight after the holiday. Her and the gay neighbours were arguing and believes we made a statement to the police, we didn’t but I wish we did. I got a message from her baby daddy asking if I was trying to hack a phone, with a picture of my email. I told him there’s no reason for me to hack someone’s phone. I sent a letter to Ella explaining everything she has done wrong to me in the past, she decided to act childish and rip it up and post it through the letterbox. I went out to the ice cream van with my nephew (11) and Ella came out with her son which is fine but she decided to tell me not to post things through her letter box, her son (14) read the letter. I told her “I don’t give a flip” she then remarked “maybe think about your life before getting involved in someone else’s” I laughed, it took everything in me to walk away from her I wanted to tell her my dad had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Since that day she’s been out in her front garden, which would be fine but she’s been out there when there’s been a thunderstorm. Mum went out to talk to her once since she still owes us £350 from the holiday Ella flipped and they started arguing, I had to call the police because I was afraid Ella may do something to my disabled mum. The police have been called 3 separate times by Ella. She has also called the firefighters over a contained fire (Mum was burning weeds in a fire safe bin) She also had to move because of the same issues in the past

145,1dme69a,AITA for not doing what my husband wanted when he wanted it done,"?
My husband had asked me the night before to drive him into town to the smoke shop before 1pm. My husband lost his licence so he can’t drive himself. I had said yes and said we could go in after our newborn had their morning nap. I was also trying to organise someone to come over to buy a puppy. Our dog had a litter and I’d been trying to sell them all.

Morning of seller coming over, they texted to ask if they could come around 12. This was at 11am, I was settled with the baby sleeping and got up and spoke to my husband if that would be alright if they came then and I’d take him into town after. 

Que the argument/yelling. He cracked it said went for a smoke and came back in. He asked what I needed him to do, I said we needed to give the pups a wash as they get messy and wanted them tidy for when they arrived. He began to loose it more saying I don’t prioritise him at all and strangers are more important. 

We needed to sell these puppies, we aren’t exactly financially stable with me bring a SAHM and him the only one working. It cost a lot more in fuel as im taking him to and from work throughout the week. So selling the pups would help, I figured once they took one we could use the money to get extra of what we need. Baby products and his smokes. 
More yelling from him resulted in me crying and getting quite upset. At this time baby woke up and I needed to still wash the puppies. So trying to organise all that after he told me off some more. The buyers came while I was still trying to wash the puppies. I asked if he could help. He walked off then came back to wash the pups, I had to run and quickly change as I was soaked.

I apologized to buyers for not being ready and the other puppies would be out soon. No issues they chose one and left. 

I came inside, he was trying holding the baby who woke up. I took baby from him got him a bottle changed him as he blew through his nappy. So I was a bit flustered. 
Husband comes back yelling some more about how I don’t prioritise him ever, I don’t love him/I don’t care. I asked what difference does it make when we go into town if you want smokes? He replied that he wanted to buy a bag of Tabaco for his uncle that he posts over to him because it’s cheaper to buy a 1kg of it here then over there. 

I asked why he didn’t just tell me it was for that? I thought it was just for smokes which we could get at any time. He yelled some more saying why he needed to tell me that and I should have just made him a priority and took him in for what he needed and I should have known he wanted to go their to pick up the tobacco and thats why he needed to go in before it closes.

I don’t think of these things because I don’t smoke, so I don’t know when his shop closes and it isn’t my first thought. As I said I thought it was just for cigarettes. 
I’m still upset and he says I’m manipulating him to feel guilty because I’m upset when he should be the one upset.

     admittedly, they are my biggest concern, but i will never tell her to get rid of them outright. i've suggested in the past that maybe they stress her out too much and, to give both the dogs and my sister a better quality of life, giving them up to a better home may be the best option. i never get pushy about it because at the end of the day, they aren't my dogs. although, they pee and poop all over our house and couches, tear up certain items (ex. my hammock i keep on the patio), and have begun to slowly destroy the body of our home by scratching away at trim and wrecking door handles by jumping on them.
     again, my biggest problem is her dogs, but it is also the constant mess. every day i come home to a new mess. the dining table is covered and only one person can occupy a seat at the table on average due to the mess. the couches are typically covered in mounds of clothes. the kitchen has dishes and trash and eaten doordash left open in the bag on the counter. we are currently battling an ant issue, and we cannot seem to get rid of them (probably due to the food related mess she leaves). every time i have spoken to her about the house rules we set before moving in together (no dogs on furniture, common spaces are to be kept clean, respect each other's privacy, etc), it turns into a heated argument. the common phrases she uses when i ask her to clean up after herself and keep the mess to a minimum is ""i guess i just won't breathe on anything"" and ""omfg you just want us to live in a dollhouse. you always want it look like no one lives here."" i've honestly gotten to the point where i don't want to come home from work anymore and i want to save up and move out on my own. we only moved out together because our parents gave her an ultimatum: get rid of her dogs or move out of their house. clearly, she chose to move out and i had just left an abusive relationship, so it seemed perfect and certainly more affordable. here is where the problem lies, she says she feels like she was forced into moving here and she hates it. there's a lot more to it, but that's something for her to tell.

147,1dmdqri,WIBTA if I distanced myself from my somewhat toxic and judgmental ex-best friend?,"I'm writing this on the behalf of my best friend, let's call her Marie for privacy purposes. She does not have reddit and is conflicted on what to do, and wants some outsider opinions.

(ALL USERS MENTIONED IN THIS POST ARE MINORS)

She had a best friend who we'll call Tracy. Tracy and Marie were good friends up until a year ago. Marie is an outgoing girl who loves to do fun activities with her friends while Tracy is a more reserved and non-optimistic person. By non optimistic I mean she is not open to any kind of activity and has a pretty high ego. She feels the need to make her judgement towards others very clear. As Marie told me, she thinks so highly of herself that she has always, for that reason, looked down on others. She (Tracy) has grown up in a religious family but has always been gently parented. Never yelled at by her parents, and always been shielded from the harsh realities of the world. There was an incident where she had \*silently\* judged Marie's cultural dance by giving her dirty looks as the video was playing. In that case she was unnecessarily sexualizing it AND being rude about it.

There has also been other times where Tracy has commented on how other girls (For example a girl a year older than her) dress, s!ut shaming one specific girl for her top when it was NONE of her business (They had never interacted or spoken to each other)

Both girls got an 85 on an assignment once and Marie said it was a good mark and supposedly Tracy replied back with a snarky ""Good for you yeah...""

Marie also claims that Tracy has displayed narcissistic behaviours. I have personally only been around Tracy for a few minutes at a time as we are not friends but Marie has ranted to me multiple times about her behaviour and it seems to me like because of how babied she is she expects everyone to bow down to her.. Either things go her way or they go off the rails because obviously if you aren't gifted like she is, you aren't worth her time.

Marie told me that if the room Tracy is in has a mirror, she'll stare at herself for a few minutes. (?) She also feels the need to constantly seek validation by fishing for compliments, or asking if her hair looks good multiple times a day.

Tracy has been going on like nothing happened and seems oblivious to the fact that Marie is mad at her. I’ve tried to give advice but I only know so much and would appreciate some help. So would she be the asshole?

149,1dmdf0i,AITA for attempting to enforce my family’s “no shoes in the house” rule with my landlord?,"For some clarification, my parents are out of town and I’m home alone while they’re away. I’m in college and I live with them. This situation happened yesterday. 

**Why the rule is enforced**: Removing your shoes in the house is something my mom has always requested of guests and my family due to her being concerned about germs spreading. She isn’t annoying about it, and It’s become a habit for me anyway so I have no problems with the rule. Other guests have so far respected her rule when she mentions it. She’s also developed certain accomadations for guests such as a comfortable seating area near the door and plastic shoe covers for those who don’t feel like removing their shoes. 

**The Story**: Yesterday my dad called me and told me our landlord and a worker would be dropping by to do some work in the kitchen. He said they’d be done in under 10 minutes. My mom chimed in and reminded me to request that the landlord and worker wear the shoe covers. 

When the landlord arrived, we greeted each other and I immediately mentioned the shoe covers before he stepped in. He smiled and moved past me, speed walking into the kitchen with his shoes on. I was shocked but I didn’t speak up. He was done in under 10 minutes and he left. There was no visible dirt where he had walked, but I cleaned the floors and texted my mom that he didn’t wear them. She expressed minor disappointment and told me to just wipe the floor where he walked. 

A few minutes later the landlord came back with the worker and the worker removed his shoes without asking me. The landlord stayed outside while the worker did something in the kitchen that took less than 5 minutes, then they both left. 

That’s it. I feel like a loser for being kind of upset that our landlord disregarded my mom’s rule, especially since he was in our house for a very short time and probably rushing. My mom told me that he is always reluctant to put the plastic things on his shoes so this isn’t new.

Let me know what you think!

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for attempting to enforce my family’s “no shoes in the house” rule with my landlord? For some clarification, my parents are out of town and I’m home alone while they’re away. I’m in college and I live with them. This situation happened yesterday. 

**Why the rule is enforced**: Removing your shoes in the house is something my mom has always requested of guests and my family due to her being concerned about germs spreading. She isn’t annoying about it, and It’s become a habit for me anyway so I have no problems with the rule. Other guests have so far respected her rule when she mentions it. She’s also developed certain accomadations for guests such as a comfortable seating area near the door and plastic shoe covers for those who don’t feel like removing their shoes. 

**The Story**: Yesterday my dad called me and told me our landlord and a worker would be dropping by to do some work in the kitchen. He said they’d be done in under 10 minutes. My mom chimed in and reminded me to request that the landlord and worker wear the shoe covers. 

When the landlord arrived, we greeted each other and I immediately mentioned the shoe covers before he stepped in. He smiled and moved past me, speed walking into the kitchen with his shoes on. I was shocked but I didn’t speak up. He was done in under 10 minutes and he left. There was no visible dirt where he had walked, but I cleaned the floors and texted my mom that he didn’t wear them. She expressed minor disappointment and told me to just wipe the floor where he walked. 

A few minutes later the landlord came back with the worker and the worker removed his shoes without asking me. The landlord stayed outside while the worker did something in the kitchen that took less than 5 minutes, then they both left. 

That’s it. I feel like a loser for being kind of upset that our landlord disregarded my mom’s rule, especially since he was in our house for a very short time and probably rushing. My mom told me that he is always reluctant to put the plastic things on his shoes so this isn’t new. I told her that she needs to be adamant with him next to she seems him, but I’m worried that we’re just holding this man to an annoying standard.

150,1dmd90l,AITA for getting upset at him for him using what he did as a “tool”,"
So I (41F) have been dating T (37M) long distance for almost 6 months. T is autistic, and can be very focused on himself and quiet and in to things the he only likes. 
I have 3 kids who are AuDH, and I have ADHD and suspected ASD. 

Last night T brought up when I told him about getting kidnapped and asulted and yelled at me for telling him again and that by now he can tell the assault story. To top it off he was in a drive through getting food and had no idea if his window was up or down. 

He brought it up as I was talking about on Tuesday I have a cancer scan and have to be there most of the day. But I can leave for a few hours in between the 3 scans. But the area is not great as the guy who asulted me lives close. 

This morning he knows something is bugging me. He has to drive to work in 18 min and I don’t want to bring it up till he is home..  he keeps dodging in till I say, then he tells me he brought up my assault as a tool to teach me to not repeat things. 

Then a lot more fighting. 
And I told him if he can’t apologize I won’t talk to him. He said he will never apologize. And a bunch of other crap. 

So am I the asshole?

151,1dmcvoz,AITA for asking for my money back 2 years later ,"Hi 25F here. 2 years ago I threw a party to celebrate my mom. I hired a friend (28M) to take photos and paid their usual fee on time and at their schedule (contract completed as well). After the party they did not reach out with photos and I had to contact them. They sent me <10 photos. My mom asked for more and I sent the message along. 
Friend, says most of the photos are blurry. I did feel a way since they are supposed to be professional, and in my opinion should have accounted for movement at a birthday party but I let it go.  I let them know it’s okay we just want them, esp since it was the first family gathering since COVID. No response. Over the last 2 years i’ve asked quarterly and got met with a new excuse (missing SD card, computer crashes, and the like) but he will look. 
      Now I’ve asked again and created the ultimatum to produce the photos or to give back half of the price I paid. This has created a tense energy between he and I. He feels I should’ve asked and pressed harder sooner while I question why I as a customer would have to chase him down for a product I paid for and have already asked for several times esp now that life has continued its harder to find. 

   Several party attendees have passed and my mom wanted those photos as it was some of the last gatherings they shared. This hurts her to not have the photos , even if they suck, and I feel my friendship is in jeopardy. I will not back down on this bc I feel like he did not take this job seriously and I’ve wasted my money.

153,1dmcoma,AITA for giving a family heirloom to my wife even though my sister didn't want me to? ,"
My (51m) parents (75m 74f) are workaholics, and addicted to money. They loved their jobs more than their children, that's why they sent me and my sister to live with our grandmother when we were 6 and 8. My sister (49f) moved out when she turned 18 and I continued living with my grandmother until I graduated from college at 25 because I enjoyed living with her and I also wanted to take care of her when she got sick.  

The thing is that a few months ago she died and she left everything to me, my sister  my wife (34f) and our children (8f 6f 4f 2f two months old boy) but my sister only wanted one thing and that was a necklace that belonged to my father's family for almost two centuries. My ancestors always gave those necklaces to their daughters-in-law when they gave birth to their first male child as a form of celebration because the family name would continue for at least one more generation. But my grandmother hated my mother and never gave it to her, she only kept it because she hoped I would give it to my wife, and I did.

I gave the necklace to my wife when our son was born and never told my sister, and when she saw my wife wearing it she lost her mind. She accused me of being greedy and selfish and also accused me of having stolen such a precious family jewel to give it to ""a whore."" She always hated my wife because she didn't agree with our grandmother adopting the daughter of the nurse who took care of her as another granddaughter. According to her, it was unfair that she loved my wife more than her, but my grandmother loved her because my wife was always there for her. My sister, on the other hand, rarely visited her after moving and when her children were born she never taught them our grandmother's language so they could communicate, and that hurt our her because she loved communicating with my children, who do know her language. 

Long story short, I don't think I did anything wrong by giving that jewel to my wife, but suddenly my sister and even my parents believe that I should return that jewel because it is something that my sister wants to keep as a memory of her grandmother but I don't care, AITA?

159,1dmbs5e,AITA for sleeping in the same room as a guy with a girlfriend? ,"Context, last summer I (19F) went to Costa Rica. I went by myself and I was staying with a host family. There was another guy who was also staying in the house with me, Ashton (18M). At times, Ashton and I were the only English speakers in the house. We pretty much spent every day together, had meals together, went to the beach together, etc. As a social person, I need friends and human interaction to be able to function. Ashton had a girlfriend, and sometimes I felt confused because I obviously didn’t want to overstep in his relationship but we were in a unique scenario where we were kind of forced to spend a lot of time together. During the beginning of the trip, I had a horrible time sleeping. It was so hot at night, and even with fans blowing on me and no covers, I could not sleep. Ashton was sleeping in the only air conditioned room in the house, and he had a bunk bed in his room. So one night I asked him if I could sleep in the top bunk in his room. I said if he felt weird about that he could totally say no and it’s no big deal. He said yes and so I spent a few nights in his room. Nothing fishy went on: we didn’t stay up late talking, or change in front of each other; I had no ulterior motives. But, I started to feel kind of weird because the family could see us getting out of the same room in the morning and some of them knew he had a girlfriend and thats kind of suspicious and so I decided to just suck it up and sleep in my own room. But he did say anytime I wanted to sleep in his room I could. 



Later on in the trip, I find out that Ashton was convinced that I liked him and he told his girlfriend this. He told me that he lied to his girlfriend about me sleeping in his room. Then I felt bad. I didn’t want him to lie. But also, it’s his job to set boundaries for his relationship, not mine. But, if I’m being honest if I had a boyfriend I wouldn’t love the idea of him sleeping in a room with another girl, especially one I know nothing about. A few of my friends thought that it was my bad to have slept in his room. So AITA? (I know this happened last year I’m just curious about what y’all will think). ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for sleeping in the same room as a guy with a girlfriend?  Context, last summer I (19F) went to Costa Rica. I went by myself and I was staying with a host family. There was another guy who was also staying in the house with me, Ashton (18M). At times, Ashton and I were the only English speakers in the house. We pretty much spent every day together, had meals together, went to the beach together, etc. As a social person, I need friends and human interaction to be able to function. Ashton had a girlfriend, and sometimes I felt confused because I obviously didn’t want to overstep in his relationship but we were in a unique scenario where we were kind of forced to spend a lot of time together. During the beginning of the trip, I had a horrible time sleeping. It was so hot at night, and even with fans blowing on me and no covers, I could not sleep.

160,1dmbk5o,AITA or a bad friend? ,"i think i’m a bad friend. this has started today when u got in an argument with a friend and she started listing the things i had done wrong. looking back i don’t think my intentions were meant to harm the girl but the action itself did. for example, my friend (for sake of privacy lets call her E) has a bad history with another good friend of mine (for privacy sake i’ll call this other friend A). A has also done me wrong but this was a few years ago and i’m a people pleaser and i hate arguing so i just move on whenever she hurts my feelings. E however isn’t like me and tends to hold grudges (which she obviously has a right to do so). To put it plainly, A has said a few things about E (not to me specifically but E told me about it) and it wasn’t the nicest of stuff. E brought this up with A but it’s didn’t resolve anything. A and E are both in my friend group and a while ago A asked me to go to a concert with her for free as she’d already payed for the ticket. I agreed as i’m not very blessed when it comes to concerts and i can usually never afford them. E was not happy about this as i knew what A had done to her but agreed to go anyways. E then said she was going to bring up the whole talking about her scandal to A and i asked her not to as it’d split up the group and my ticket would more than likely be taken off me ( i really wanted to go as i’ve not had a very good year). so basically i told my friend to wait before confronting her so i could do something i never really get to do as i can’t afford it. does this make me an awful person? i didn’t take the ticket to intentionally hurt E, i did it cause it was one of my favourite singers.
