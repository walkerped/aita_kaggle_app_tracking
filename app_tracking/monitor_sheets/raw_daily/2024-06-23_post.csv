0,1dmqnxi,WIBTA if I set rules and boundaries around my birth?,"I (24f) am a ftm with a baby due in the next month. Baby will be the first grandchild on my side and second on my husbands side. We’re all very excited to meet the little wiggle worm and just ready to have baby home.
  Both sides of the family live at least 6+ hours away from where we currently live. My mom has requested that I call her the second I go into labor so she and my dad can drive the 6 hours to come see us and meet the baby. I want to state I love my parents to pieces, but sometimes they’re a bit overbearing. They plan on staying at my house for a week after I go into labor. I know my mom intends on helping with cleaning and cooking and housework, so I’m not AS apprehensive of them coming. I just know it will be overwhelming.
  Husband’s mother lives farther away from my parents and plans to fly in. I have been warned that she most likely will do nothing other than hold the baby. Her flight is scheduled for the end of next month, so there should be no overlap between sets of parents. 
  Here’s where I may be the AH. I have considered not telling my parents about my labor until AFTER baby is born and we’re home and settled, which will upset them. I had also considered setting rules where I will NOT be catering and hosting family and guests like usual; which is most likely what his mother will expect. Sister says I’ll be the AH since my mom is excited for the baby and I’d be depriving her the experience. She also thinks I should be able to let both sets of grandparents bond with the baby. Husband says do whatever I feel necessary since I’m planning a natural birth and I’ll be in pain.

1,1dmklme,AITA for wanting my partner to apologise?,"Me (15FTM) and my partner (17MTF) have been dating for a year. She and I have got along well and we even introduced each other to some things like game and show franchises that we really liked a lot. Overall, our relationship was going great. Until some major arguments started happening.



These arguments began in July when a friend of ours was in a low mood.



However this month…some bad things have happened.



I was wanting to play a game with our friend that I found really interesting because of a video I had watched. He said he’ll think about it since he’s picky about trying new games (and I know that’s not the case since me, him and my gf had played various discord games right off the bat without any “I’ll think about it”s). When I was patiently waiting for him to give me an actual answer on wether or not he wanted to play the game, my gf mentioned something about wanting to play Minecraft, aka a game my computer refuses to let me play on due to issues I can’t even fix. Even though he said he was ”Still thinking about it” he said yes. This made me annoyed beyond belief.



Whenever it comes to her and him playing Minecraft, they play it for the rest of the call unlike other games where they play them for only a short amount of time. This was where things started getting bad.  I can’t remember what else had happened yesterday but I did say something among the lines of “I want a girlfriend, not a bully”. This made her yell at me. She kept on saying that she wasn’t being a bully because of the fact that she helped me with coming out as Trans and so on so forth to. She asked me something and then said “Are you too much of a wuss to answer?”. This made me even more upset to the point where I physically didn’t want to speak. Eventually, it got me to tell her something that I was brutally honest about: Her not apologising after these kinds of things. I was hoping that she would realise her mistake but I was being wishful and it ended up with her excusing her actions. She told me that she can’t control these things and that she wasn’t in the wrong. I believe that in order for a relationship to stay healthy, both parties should apologise. She then started jumping to conclusions like thinking that I didn’t want her on Minecraft anymore, which wasn’t the case. She didn’t even let me tell her what I wanted, she just immediately thought that I was forcing her to stay off of Minecraft. The only way how I could’ve prevented things to get worse was to force myself to say things like “Can we forget this ever happened?” since I know that no matter what, she’ll never see her true mistakes in this relationship. Everything went on as normal afterwards.

2,1dmgquv,AITA for refusing to change the baptism date because of God Mother's concert? ,"I’m a FTM (f26) and when I announced my pregnancy to my bestfriend of 24 years in Aug 2023 (F25) I asked her to be my babies GM. Of course she accepted. 
Baby was born in March 2024 and in April I began telling her I was planning Baby’s baptism in October. She told me “plan it and I’II be there”.

 I had to fill out online forms, confirm her information, wait for the administrator to get back to me, then for several weeks frustratingly playing phone tag with the Priest to arrange a meeting and discuss the logistics of the baptism. 

I updated her throughout the process and she reassured me several times she would be there. Finally got to set a meeting in June and I let her know right away the date I picked in October. She said great initially and started planning her and her BF to come down.

 A few days later she sends me a message saying that she has a problem and that the date I chose was the date of a concert she got tickets her BF got her for Christmas.

DH and I had already sent out invites and got RSVPs from his family and mine. We also cant change the date as we have a hectic schedule which is why we needed it to be in October to begin with.

 I really wish she had told me about the concert date ahead of time and this whole thing could have been avoided. To me this is a life event that only happens once. It’s supposed to be an honor and there is a part of me that’s really frustrated at her.

The performer Is someone she’s only started liking for a few years, they are likely to go on tour again, and the tickets were relatively cheap. I would understand if this had been someone she loved for life and I think it would be so important she would have told me the dates the second I mentioned October.

She technically could do both but she has come up with a lot of excuses. There is a 7.5hr difference between the events and although she would have a 5hr drive home I was hoping she would consider it since it was her mistake.

 Nope. She claims she won’t do that since her BF  is upset about the date and will be in too terrible of a mood to go to the concert with her. He won’t let her drive alone and she won’t take a train since it will cause her to miss the concert. 

 Long story short I have to message her back after she told me she won’t be coming on the day I planned. If I want her there l would have to pick a different day. Preferably not Holy Sunday since Saturdays work better for her so she won’t be tired at work on Monday.

 I’m sleep deprived and recently dianosed with PPD and don’t want to react harshly based off my raging hormones. She knows how much this means to me as I lost my dad really young and religion has been a huge part of my healing process so I have a lot of emotion when it comes to this.

4,1dmb7l6,AITA for allowing my bf to spend the night even though it makes my sister uncomfortable?,"Due to tough circumstances, my sister and I, both in our 30s, moved back in with our parents, into our old bedrooms. Before this, my boyfriend and I lived together and have been dating for almost two years. My boyfriend occasionally stays over, about 2-3 nights a week, since he now lives an hour away. When he was staying overnight and I left for work, I’d let him sleep in, he’d take my dog out in the morning and then leaves for his place.

Recently, my sister told me she felt uncomfortable with him staying over, especially when I leave early for work. I took issue with this for several reasons:

	1.	He doesn’t bother anyone and has always been respectful.
	2.	Our parents didn’t mind until my sister brought it up.
	3.	My sister’s ex boyfriend at one time lived with us for a period, which didn’t bother me. (She’s single now)
	4.	Our brother previously stayed with us and his fiancée visited and stayed over without issue.

When I asked my sister for a specific reason, she couldn’t provide one other than her discomfort. After our conversation, she tried to convince our dad to prohibit him from coming over simply because she didn’t want my bf at the house. Dad didn’t agree to doing that. So then she insisted to our parents that my boyfriend should not stay overnight.   My dad eventually said my boyfriend couldn’t stay upstairs. Eventually, after my sister kept complaining and wearing our dad down, my bf wasn’t allowed to spend the night. One night, my boyfriend and I fell asleep on the couch, and she tattled to my dad. Another time, she called dad at work because I left my boyfriend at the house in the morning.

I don’t understand why my sister is so concerned about my relationship. It’s unfair that she and our brother could have their significant others stay over, but she objects to mine. He doesn’t touch our food, or make himself at home; he stays in my room, out of the way. I’m well aware that it is my parents’ home, and if I don’t want to accept the double standards my sister is wanting them to have, I should move out. She could do the same if she’s bothered by my happiness. Why is she so involved in my business? She seems to be hyper focused on my situation and controlling the outcome of that. I don’t get it.

I have made these for us many times. It is a simple process. You take the pizza stone and put it in the oven let the oven preheat. Put the pizza on the paddle and slide it onto the hot stone. Once it's ready you slide the paddle under the pizza and pull it out. Put it on the carving board and cut it. 

Easy right? 

Nope. 

My pizza stone was dirty, it is scorched not dirty, so her brilliant idea was to make the pizza on my plastic cutting board. 

Because that way she could just take the cutting board out with oven mitts and cut the pizza without having to use all the tools. 

I got home to see black smoke coming out of my house and my girlfriend on the phone with 911. 

My dog is not on his leash and he's going crazy. 

I go to the front door to see if it's hot in the house or if I can see flames.  

No flames, no heat. I get to the stove and turn it off. I open the sliding door to let out more smoke and get my leash on the way out. 

The firefighters are there within five minutes and the smoke is already dissipating. They go in to make sure. 

All clear. 

Thank god they were there less than an hour. It is covered by the city. If it was over an hour I would have been charged for the response. 

My oven is fucked though. And I have a lot of smoke damage to clean up. 

I told my girlfriend I was glad she was okay but that she is a dumbass and she wasn't allowed in my house alone for a while. I took her key away.  We do not live together. But she has roommates and likes having a big house to herself on her days off. 

She says that it's a mistake anyone could make and that I'm an asshole for calling her names. Yes she said those words.

Today we were at a family get together. We have a 3 year old and I am 20 weeks pregnant. It was a very eventful day-swimming, grilling, bounce house for the kids, and typical social interaction. It was a rough day for me because I’m already quite big and in a lot of pain on top of being exhausted from pregnancy. We are also struggling with potty training. I took the brunt of parenting because my husband was grilling but he did handle most of the pool time responsibilities. I had to lock myself away multiple times throughout the day to cry from being overstimulated and exhausted.

My husband has really bad anxiety surrounding germs and he accidentally drank from someone else’s drink while we were there and he was really struggling-thinking he was going to get sick or in his words “he drank after someone who has an STD”. As far as I know, no one in my family has an STD and he knows that thought is coming from nowhere. He was texting me about it while we were there and I wasn’t really responding because I was so tired and also trying to clean up after my kid so we could go home. He asked me when we got home if I saw his texts and I told him “I did but I didn’t really have the mental capacity to handle that.” I apologized and it was sincere and he just kinda sighed and we preceded getting our kid to bed.

He is in the shower now and doesn’t seem upset about it, but I feel so torn about me saying that. One one hand, I feel like I’m setting a boundary and advocating for my needs (something I’ve been working on in therapy) but in the other hand I feel it’s my job as his spouse and partner to be there for him and support him.

My parents had 5 kids two boys then they tried for a girl but ended up with triplet boys that they didn’t want instead.they told us this “jokingly” every  chance they got but I think it was true.I lost my brothers when we were 16 .they died in a car accident due to our uncle being intoxicated 

About two months later I got home from school to my parents in the backyard  burning  all of our pictures and baby stuff. They had completely cleared out  our room leaving only my things. I was only able to salvage one baby photo (I dont know who) and parts of baby blankets. I still don’t know what they did with their ashes.I probably cried as hard as the day they died.
The reasoning I was given was that my mother needed to let go of everything to move on .My older  Brothers fully supported this.the crazy part is she still kept up photos of her brother who was the cause of everything. Which led to me shutting down I hardly ever spent time with them from then on.
 
My parents and oldest brother continued on with life like everything was fine they didn’t miss them and would never talk about them. Only my second oldest brother would reminisce with me sometimes but as time went on even he seemed to forget them.my extended family also got rid of any pictures and refused to talk about my brothers in fear that my mother would get upset . It was all in the interest of her mental health but no one cared about mine.

Then when I was graduating at 18 my best friend asked if I  didn’t want to submit any photos of my brothers for my senior page in our year book  since they were given in memory blocks in the book since we attended a k-12 school and all the teachers knew them.after telling her what had happened she apparently got our entire class and the av class to dig through years of video and photos from school events gathering everything they could find with us in it.which they gave me at our pre graduation party . I never shared this with my family. I moved out the day after graduation and have barely spoken to them since.
  
My oldest brother passed away two months ago. I didn’t attend the funeral or reach out to my parents then earlier this week my parents showed up at my door . Demanding that I give them the photos and videos that I have of my brothers. 

My mother was sobbing on my couch about how sorry she was and that we could go to therapy. My father seemed just as remorseful saying  that my oldest brother’s death hit them hard and they want a better relationship with the last two kids they have.I felt nothing for them I told them no and that I would like for them to leave.I don’t know who told them about the photos but my phone has been blowing up ever since with random people berating me for treating my grief stricken parents so awfuly so am I the asshole here?

8,1dmapq0,AITA for ditching my friend on prom night?,"School dances have never been my thing, so I spent a long time debating whether I wanted to go to my senior prom. I ultimately decided to go because my boyfriend is homeschooled and I can tell he feels like he's missing out on having a normal high school experience, so I figured taking him to prom would be a nice gesture. Unfortunately, I didn't make up my mind until two weeks before prom, which meant we didn't have a lot of time to make plans.

I knew my best friend was already planning to go to prom with some of her other friends, so the next week at school, I asked if my boyfriend and I could tag along with her group. She said it was fine.

A couple days later, my boyfriend started asking me about dinner plans. When I asked my friend about it, I found out that she didn't have any plans for dinner, or dessert, or anything at all. I asked her if she had any food preferences, and she said she didn't care where we went. Then I asked the other girls in her group where they wanted to go, and they didn't have any ideas either. Finally, I asked my boyfriend where he wanted to go, and he too had no ideas. So I decided to bite the bullet and pick the place myself. 

There was also the issue of transportation. My mom offered to drive us to the restaurant, and then the dance afterward, but said that everyone needed to find their own transportation to our house first so that she didn't have to drive around and pick everyone up.

The day before the dance, my friend approached me and told me she wanted to coordinate outfit colors and that we were all going to wear black. I said that wouldn't be possible because the dress I had chosen was blue. She asked if she could see a picture, and when I showed her the one I said, she held back a laugh and said, ""You seriously want to wear a Walmart dress?"" I told her that I liked the dress just fine, and besides, my boyfriend had already picked out a matching tux. Then she said she didn't think it was fair that I wasn't giving her any input, and I told her that I would've appreciated her input if she had given earlier when I expressly asked for it. Since her phone was broken and I couldn't contact her via text, I told her that I would email her the schedule. 

I sent the email first thing the next morning, and explained that she needed to be at my house around 5:30. She didn't respond, so I tried texting the other girls in our group, but they didn't respond either. Finally, I tried calling her mom, but got no response. Throughout the day, I tried several more times to contact her, but I was met with radio silence. When 5:30 rolled around, I still hadn't heard anything from anyone other than my boyfriend. Not wanting to miss out on prom night, I finally decided to just ditch the rest of the group and take my boyfriend to dinner.

My friend made it to the dance on her own, but she was upset that I left her behind.

9,1dmaplr,"AITA, for trying to make new friends after constantly being left out?","
I, an 18-year-old female, joined a theatre class in high school. I had one friend in that class, which led to making more friends. However, no matter how much I tried to talk to my other ""friends,"" they would barely respond to me. They even made plans right in front of me without including me. So, I gave up trying to talk to them altogether and focused on my one friend, whom I had been friends with since the beginning of the year.

Unfortunately, my friend had to switch to virtual classes due to health reasons, leaving me with nobody to talk to in the theatre class. When I tried to engage with my ""friend group,"" they constantly made fun of me and talked behind my back. One day in April, the day before one of our play's opening nights, I decided to try talking to other people in the class. I ended up making really good friends with three other people, and we became very close after the show ended.

Everything was going well for the next few weeks until one day, one of my old ""friends"" started talking to me again. He expressed concern about me and claimed he was trying to save me from my new friends. I didn't respond at that moment because it was during a passing period, but it made me wonder why he even cared who I hung out with.

After that, not much happened until the last day of school. When I checked my phone, I noticed that a friend from another class had unfollowed me on everything and stopped talking to me altogether. Curious, I asked another friend from that class why this had happened. She told me that the friend who unfollowed me didn’t want to deal with one of my other friends, which made no sense because I had never talked about my other friends to her.

I found out that one of my ""old friends"" had spread a rumor saying that another friend had groomed one of my friends and had advised her not to talk to me at all. This ""friend"" is known for talking trash and spreading rumors about everyone she meets. When I confronted her, she said that she and my ""old friends"" felt hurt that I didn't want to hang out with them and called me a bitch.

10,1dma8pu,AITA because I feel my mom didn’t react strongly enough to my cancer scare?,"Hello! I (21F) discovered a lump in my breast October ‘23. This was investigated and deemed benign through aspiration. Although the lump deflated initially, it returned bigger and feeling different. I got another ultrasound and the lump was indicated BIRADS 4- which means it is a suspicious abnormality with a chance of malignancy. I was scheduled for a core biopsy. This really scared me.

The radiologist made me scared based on how serious he was, but the nurses for my biopsy were SO gentle and treated me like a baby deer that was about to run, despite me being fine. It made me scared that I was sick. I dealt with all this and expressed to my parents that I was scared and highly anxious. They reacted by downplaying the issue and kept telling me that I was going to be fine. I have previously expressed to them that being told “you’re fine/it will be fine” is not comforting to me in scenarios that are out of my control, they only make me frustrated because it feels like a lie to me. 

Luckily, the biopsy came back negative for cancer. It’s just fat necrosis from a previous surgery and is and will always be benign. I expressed to my mother that I was really scared and wanted her comfort but she didn’t offer it. I wanted a hug or just any recognition that I was dealing with something very scary. She expressed that she knew I would be fine so it was no big deal. I expressed that no one knew if it was fine or not- that’s what scared me. I feel like I went through a really scary event and was dealing with a lot of anxiety and was left to suffer in it alone instead of getting the comfort I needed.

13,1dma2aq,AITA for snapping at my mother,"Just a  little backstory leading up the situation. 

I (36M) am married to (39F). I also have a sister (39F) (this fact will make sense later in the story.) We have been together for 9 years and married for 6 of them. I have a somewhat of a unique last name. Not out of the ordinary but certainly different. There’s more of us in the country other than my family. My mother has had this weird little obsession of “passing on the family name” and if I dig deep enough in my memory I’m pretty sure it predates me meeting my wife. 

Originally, when dating, my mother was kind to my wife but as soon as we got married it’s like she couldn’t fake it anymore and started on the typical MIL bullshit. She likely blames my wife for us living in a different state (even though it was a decision made by the two of us).

Well anyways, we currently have a 16 month old little girl. (Whom my mother has seen twice in her life).  When the news dropped that she was a girl, the subtle disappointment of not being a boy was leeching out of my mother. We recently found out we were pregnant with baby #2 and before even finding out the gender she was already saying stuff like “hope it’s a boy” “gotta pass on the family name”. Every time she mentioned it I made some snarky comment like my daughter’s husband is changing his name. Or she’s gonna hyphenate. And just kept making hints that it doesn’t matter. 

Immediately I began thinking what a terrible way to look at my daughter (her granddaughter) as a disappointment of not being able to pass on something as mundane as a last name. I then thought of my sister and what kind of way she must be feeling being the first born and probably disappointing my mother by being born female until I was born.

A couple weeks ago we found out baby #2 is a boy. We hesitated telling my family cause we already knew what my mother was going to say. We decided to release the information through Facebook and like a foregone conclusion, there was her comment about praising it being a boy and “passing on the family name”. 

When I saw this comment I lost it. I texted her immediately asking her “Am I a Duke? Do we have some land with a castle in Wales that I need to be aware of?” Acting lost she responded “what?” So I sent her a screenshot of her Facebook comment with a response of “I sure hope my sister was never made to feel less than cause she “couldn’t pass on the family name. It doesn’t matter but I’m certainly not going to allow my daughter to feel less cause she’s a girl”

She then responded with “are you being serious or is this you joking?”

I then told her “I have hinted to you time and time again that that is a rude and inappropriate thing to say but you still continue. So now I’m being direct: this is a rude and inappropriate thing to say. I love you. Goodnight”

14,1dma1oq,AITA for snapping at someone for calling me snobby for where I went to university and work?,"Throwaway for anonymity

Three pieces of background info:
1. I come from an immigrant family that only knew of Ivys. My parents NEVER pressured me to go, but from a young age I really wanted to make them proud.
2. As a teen I got frustrated with my state’s policies and practices, so I decided I would go out of state for college.
3. My family was low income and a minority so I knew if I went to a private college, I would get a lot of financial aid and if I get a merit scholarship, it’d be almost a full ride.

I was accepted to a top school that was MUCH cheaper than any state school and better for what I wanted to study. My parents hadn’t heard of it before I got in and were proud of me, but they were even more proud when they found out the rank. I graduated a couple years ago and applied EVERYWHERE for jobs, even in my home state, and had a couple of job offers. The best offer paid the most, was in a low COLA, and aligned with my interests, but also at an Ivy. Again, my parents were proud I could even get a job in this economy, but my mom was quick to post to FB about it.

I acknowledge prestige was part of my decision making as again, low income family and a minority, I need whatever advantage I can get in life to be successful, but I never talk about the prestige. Where I work or went to college only comes up if someone asks me.

Ever since I left for college, some people from my hometown have viewed me as a snob, and I feel like it worsened with my job. I visited our hometown recently and met up with some people from high school. Someone asked where I work now, and I said x school. Another person said “of course” and I asked what they meant. They said ever since high school I’ve been so snobby wanting to go somewhere prestigious, and that there’s nothin wrong with not going to an Ivy. I said that’s true, but I applied to universities that were the best for my major and they all happened to be out of state, and I took a job that aligns perfectly with my career goals. I also pointed out how no one had heard of the university I attended before I got in, and that people only found out about its “prestige” the day we graduated because someone looked up the rank.

They still insisted I was a snob and started ranting about how I make people like her look bad because it looks like she didn’t work hard enough. Some people agreed with her and I snapped. I pointed out how I took every single IB/AP our school had to offer and did several internships in college, and that I’m still working my ass off now because I have plans to go to med school. I reminded them of how my family was so poor going to a top school was cheaper than the state school, why would I go to the state school then? I didn’t even get a single job offer in my state, what was I supposed to do? Turn down the offers I got and wait for a job in my home state?

I got called sensitive and a jerk for my response and that my behavior proved I was a snob. I left immediately, but AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-23,"AITA for snapping at someone for calling me snobby for where I went to university and work? Throwaway for anonymity

Three pieces of background info:
1. I come from an immigrant family that only knew of Ivys. My parents NEVER pressured me to go, but from a young age I really wanted to make them proud.
2. As a teen I got frustrated with my state’s policies and practices, so I decided I would go out of state for college.
3. My family was low income and a minority so I knew if I went to a private college, I would get a lot of financial aid and if I get a merit scholarship, it’d be almost a full ride.

I was accepted to a top school that was MUCH cheaper than any state school and better for what I wanted to study. My parents hadn’t heard of it before I got in and were proud of me, but they were even more proud when they found out the rank. I graduated a couple years ago and applied EVERYWHERE for jobs, even in my home state, and had a couple of job offers. The best offer paid the most, was in a low COLA, and aligned with my interests, but also at an Ivy. Again, my parents were proud I could even get a job in this economy, but my mom was quick to post to FB about it.

I acknowledge prestige was part of my decision making as again, low income family and a minority, I need whatever advantage I can get in life to be successful, but I never talk about the prestige. Where I work or went to college only comes up if someone asks me.

Ever since I left for college, some people from my hometown have viewed me as a snob, and I feel like it worsened with my job. I visited our hometown recently and met up with some people from high school. Someone asked where I work now, and I said x school. Another person said “of course” and I asked what they meant. They said ever since high school I’ve been so snobby wanting to go somewhere prestigious, and that there’s nothin wrong with not going to an Ivy. I said that’s true, but I applied to universities that were the best for my major and they all happened to be out of state, and I took a job that aligns perfectly with my career goals. I also pointed out how no one had heard of the university I attended before I got in, and that people only found out about its “prestige” the day we graduated because someone looked up the rank.

They still insisted I was a snob and started ranting about how I make people like her look bad because it looks like she didn’t work hard enough. Some people agreed with her and I snapped.

15,1dm9wvb,AITAH for choosing to not to surround myself with my sister? ,"So long story short, my little niece visits where I live often and we normally just casually talk about a whole lot of nothing. Today she had mentioned to me that her mom (my sister) said that I needed to leave (I live with my parents, she lives in their other house next door). I was like that’s weird. She started talking about other things like a joke about what animals are going to eat us. Mine was a shark(I spit my water out cause her saying that was so funny) and hers was an elephant. Well, she ended up telling me that her mom said that I won’t have my son back until I move out. I was thinking where is all of this coming from and why is my niece telling me this stuff. Mind you my sister is pregnant and almost due in a couple of months so I wanted to help her with the baby and my niece and nephew while she recovers. Now, I just want to sit back and not partake in helping her at all. But another part of me thinks of the fact that I’ve already missed out on so much. Am I the asshole for wanting to keep my complete distance from here and not to allow her around my son at all?

16,1dm9wpx,AITA for refusing to meet my friend’s partner? ,"My friend (F44) was in a relationship with a man where there were issues. He seemed controlling and coercive, had incidents where he threw furniture at her and he sent her long abusive messages. Our friendship group tried to support her and finally we succeeded and she left the relationship. Two years later, they are suddenly back together and he has ‘REALLY changed this time’. Apparently he’s done anger classes and therapy and is treating her like a queen. And now she wants me to come to this lunch thing to meet him as he wants to take an interest in her friends. I just remember all the midnight phone calls from 2 years ago and all the drama and the nasty stuff he would say to her. Am I the asshole if I don’t go to this lunch?

The problem is, she doesn’t want anything to do with my and actively avoids me. She and her husband also stare a lot of me during my workouts and make me feel uncomfortable. I told my husband about it and he decided to talk to the husband and ultimately became friends with. The wife still avoids me and stares but won’t talk to me. My husband takes our kids to hangout with them even knowing how uncomfortable they make me and ultimately the reason he even started talking to them.

18,1dm9fkv,AITA for telling my cousin it’s exhausting to hang out with her because the only music she will play is Taylor Swift? ,"I (30F) and my cousin (29F) get along well unlike the rest of our family and I consider her the closest thing I’ll get to a sister. She has always loved Taylor swift but I haven’t really been the biggest fan. No hate against Taylor swift it’s just not my kind of music except for a couple of songs. Lately, my cousin has become that person where if you tell her you haven’t seen a movie or heard a song she will sit there and play it for you and make sure you listen to every single lyric or line. She also does this if you say you don’t care for an artist and she thinks that if you listen to them more and more you will all of a sudden like them. 

With all of the Taylor swift hype lately, she’s become a huge Swiftie. Now when I come to her house or hang out with her all she does is blast Taylor swift songs. Whether it’s in the car or at the house, she’s always singing Taylor swift or playing her music telling me to listen intently to the lyrics because she loves them. I’m all for her loving music but that doesn’t mean I need to like the same type of music as her. I finally told her that I don’t care for Taylor swift and I frankly don’t want to listen super intently to her songs nor do I need her album or songs brought up in every conversation we have every time we hang out. Whenever I say this she just says “I’ll change your mind about her one day”. It’s getting really annoying so my response to that comment was “it’s going to be really exhausting hanging out with you then since I’m forced to listen to something I done care for”. 

I didn’t want to come off as rude or unsupportive of her liking Taylor swift but I would rather listen to songs that we both enjoy with a little Taylor swift mixed I here and there. I feel like when I hang out with my friends I try to play a neutral mix of pop music that maybe everyone can enjoy and I wouldn’t play music that somebody has expressed they are not a fan of.
