0,1dn2opa,AITA for not calling my dad after he told me he had cancer?,"My dad (60s M) and me (20s M) have had a historically poor relationship (nothing crazy; I'm gay and he's an immigrant). BUT it's recently been getting a lot better since I've been going to grad school, he's been an empty nester, and my sister gave him grandkids. 

Recently, however, he gave me a call. Told me ""it's good news honestly"" and then proceeded to tell me he got diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, didn't tell anyone, had the prostate removed last week, and finally has the catheter out. The entire time he's chuckling and laughing and telling me he's feeling all good. I'm obviously extremely upset, but trying to comfort him and be shocked. I keep asking if he's ok and he keeps saying yes. 

To note: I just completed my FIRST YEAR of medical school. For those that don't know, this is a 90% lecture year. I work with dead bodies, and I'm not interested in surgery so I have done ZERO surgical shadowing/rotations. He was extremely chill, I made it clear that I wanted to be there for him, and he should talk to me if there's anything. Didn't mention any wounds, told me he's not on any medications, didn't mention anything about pain. 

Later, mom texted me and mt sister that we should reach out to our dad. We are not a family who calls each other, but here's where I probably was the asshole. Instead of directly asking ""how it's going?"" I started talking about a video game we both mutually like and he has been playing recently and I see him popping up on my steam. FOR CONTEXT we are not a really open or warm family. My dad and I would get into really bad arguements, he would never say the words ""I'm sorry,"" but he would buy me a gift I didn't like or come watch tv shows with me and my mom. I felt like opening about talking about the video game was the long-distance equivalent of sitting next to him and watching tv. I assumed part of the reason he didn't tell us he had cancer was because he didn't want our pity. 

Yesterday (about 5 days after he told us about the cancer) my mom texted me ""as a future doctor and current son you should reach out and ask your father about his recovery after the surgery."" I'm kind of like... WTF. Does he even want that? But fine. I ask him how it's going

Dad: it's going
Me: do you want to talk about it?
Him: if you want me to.
Me: of course!
Him: *16 hrs radio silence*
Me: I don't mean to pry, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to
Dad: like I said, I don't mind talking about it to someone who asks.

We set up a time to call. 

Turns out prostate removal surgery SUCKS SHIT!! We had an hour chat and I apologized a lot, that I had no idea how he was feeling, I thought that he was genuinely doing ok. He kept responding like ""how could I be ok?"" After 30 minutes he started to warm up, but he and my mom are really making me feel like shit about it.

1,1dn2jt5,AITA for inviting my brother and niece to the circus? ,"I (31F) enjoy any chance I can get to spend with my brother Robert (35M) and my niece Cindy (4F). With it being summer, the circus has come to the area and it’s a good chance for the whole family to enjoy a day out. 

I will say, we don’t get along with Robert’s wife Kelly (34F). This stems from the fact that during COVID, she quit her job and my brother decided to pay all her prior school loans, debts, and bought her a new car as her old one kept breaking down. Our parents (64F and 65M) immigrated to America and saw Kelly’s behavior as being a gold-digger and using Robert for his money when they worked their way up in their career fields respectively. When we told Robert this, he told Kelly and needless to say, our relationship has been strained since then even with apologies and trying to move forward. This is Kelly’s right, and so we only really see her at holidays and sometimes birthdays. 

The problem lies in that our parents are still somewhat strained with Robert as well. I consider them to be the very prideful “we don’t want to beg to see him and Cindy” type of ppl. Because of this, they don’t always like me talking to Robert or believe there’s no reason to really talk to him since he spends 80-90% of time with Kelly’s side of the family and usually makes no effort to see us unless it’s a special occasion. I know Kelly is his wife and it makes sense to spend time with them. I just miss how close we were and I don’t want to further distance myself the way our parents have. 

We all will be in town this weekend and Dad mentioned buying tickets for the circus. Originally, he told me he would just buy 3 tickets for himself, Mom, and I but I overheard Mom say when I visited earlier in the month she would like Cindy to come just to see the event, but wouldn’t ask Robert as he is dictated by Kelly and her family. 

Robert FaceTimed me back on Friday with Cindy and after catching up, I decided to ask if he was free next weekend for the circus. He said he would check his calendar and later texted me he and Cindy could come. 

I told Dad today while visiting Robert is free to come to the circus too with Cindy. Though he hasn’t bought the tickets yet, he gave me this glare/frown and asked why I told Robert in the first place. I said I brought up when he FaceTimed me. He dropped it after that and I went back home. 

I feel like a bit of an asshole for going behind Dad, but I don’t want to purposely keep things from my brother just because we don’t really get along with his wife. 

Edit: Kelly works as admin at a nearby university, much less stressful for her she previously worked for United Airlines and quit right before COVID hit

2,1dn1xgs,AITA for leaving my two friends on holiday?,"
So I 20 F went on holiday with my best friend 21F and her two close friends, the dispute happened when we all agreed to book a taxi back to near our apartment and grab food before we went home. I booked the taxi expecting it to take a while, as they usually do… However it was accepted and in the pickup location instantly which we were 5 minutes away from. I told my friends to come with me because the taxi was here and proceeded to walk off, assuming they’d follow behind. When I arrived at the taxi I had already been charged a late fee as my free waiting time had expired, and the only person who had arrived with me was one of the other friends. My best friend and her friend were behind us by about a minute or two so we sat in the taxi to wait for them. Now, after drinking a lot that night I can’t exactly recall if the friend closed the door or the driver just started driving which closed the door, but nonetheless, it wasn’t me, and he drove off from our two friends. I instantly started shouting for him to stop and that there were two more people to wait for, however the driver didn’t stop until I ended up physically screaming at him to STOP. We didn’t make it too far down the road, so the other friend hung out the taxi and called out for our friends, who were nowhere to be seen. Considering we told the taxi we were waiting for more people, who weren’t there, he drove off again. I instantly call my friend with no answer, however she called the other girl I was with. We were met with screaming down the phone, “how could you leave us you’re tramps, etc etc”, and she wouldn’t listen to our explanation and hung up. 

I took it upon myself to message the group chat explaining what had happened to be met with the same abuse we received down the phone, said friend is adamant we could’ve waited (which we did) or should’ve got him to stop (which we also did, but he drove off again, without our permission). She keeps saying “you left us and got in a taxi without us”. And I get it, to her at the time it probably did look like that, however i’ve explained at least 10 times now that we tried to get him to stop and wait for them which he didn’t, and that we didn’t intend for him to just drive off…

She refused to talk to me for 2 days unless i apologised (amongst other spiteful things, which aren’t relevant to the story), which I haven’t, because I don’t see how I am personally at fault for what happened when I tried to do the right thing and wait for her. She still isn’t talking to me, and because of the uncomfortable atmosphere I left my holiday alone, early. 

In my eyes it was a misunderstanding that got perceived the wrong way. No one was left on their own, and we were only about 20 minutes away from our apartment. Her argument that leaving two people alone was wrong also quickly became redundant when my friend and the girl who was also left behind spent the next day together going out without us because she was giving us the silent treatment.

So am I in the wrong and do I owe my friend an apology??",Not the A-hole,2024-06-24,"AITA for leaving my two friends on holiday?

I was disappointed and hurt but accepted it. I sent everyone pictures from what was going on, and they all got mad because I didn't tell them it would be like how it was, I didn't know. Then later in the year I got sick, really sick, I was hospitalized overnight and my parents came down, two weeks later it flared up worse then before and the hospital put me in the icu for a week. my dad kept making excuses, he promised a friend to help him with his boat, then he agreed to go on a fishing trip.

9,1dn0yyp,AITA for expecting my friends hike in the rain and wanting the best for them? ,"I 24M and my friends are fortunate enough to live in an area with a beautiful mountain with an infamous trail that’s difficult but rewarding to hike. We had originally planned to do this hike over the weekend as a bonding activity between the guys. 

The night before, one of my friends messaged the group chat that it was supposed to be pouring the next day and another suggested we postpone as a result. I told them a week before that rain or shine, we’d be going. My friend argued that he did not want to get his car wet and muddy after the hike to which I said wouldn’t be an issue if we just brought towels and an extra pair of shoes. My friends continued to argue that we should postpone or do something indoors, but I felt that they were just making excuses as they have done so in the past. I told them that unless there was something serious stopping them from going, then they need to stop making excuses and to go. For context，my friends have always had trouble committing to self-improvement plans and this situation was another symptom of that. I came to expect that they would try cancelling for some reason or another.

The conversation continued to grow more heated when my friend said “okay have fun by yourself then” and I countered by saying that “this is why they were the way [they] are right now.” The conversation then shifted as I explained that they were too soft and needed to learn that not everything always would go the way they wanted to. I mentioned that by showing up, they’re already better than the majority that would rather lie around at home playing games. My friend got upset, saying that not everything is a life lesson and that this wasn’t representative of life or their personalities. 

I told him I think he’s wrong and that it is indeed representative of life because the conditions for us to act will never be in our favour and that they’re simply making excuses to not do what’s good for us (ie. exercise). My friend continued to argue that I was resorting to personal attacks (since he enjoys sitting at home playing games) but I was just stating facts and at the end of the day just want all my friends to succeed and to be better than me.

10,1dn0vao,AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop putting my things in his son’s room?,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been together for 3+ years, living together for 2. He has a 13 year old son (had him when he was very young). He is at our house Friday night-Monday morning. 

Since we’ve moved in together, there has been an ongoing issue that my things end up in his son’s room, especially if he’s cleaning or moving stuff around. 

Last week, I came home from work and realized my PS5 was missing the HDMI cord. Sons room. Disconnected and on the floor. Because son was using it earlier and just unplugged it instead of putting it back. Which, he’s 13 and in his own world. My boyfriend let him borrow it, so he should have put it back when son was done. 
Side note, I bought his son a couple of cords so my BF would stop taking mine for him to use. No idea what happened to them. 

The other day, I was looking for my dogs combing supplies. She has her own cabinet of “dog stuff.” They somehow ended up in his son’s room. He said he was reorganizing the cabinet and took some things out, and he must have moved the comb in the process. 

Today, my boyfriend was taking a nap and I was going to go to the gym. I could not find my headphones. They are usually in my gym bag, but I had taken them out to charge earlier today. 

I looked in his son’s room but did not see them, so I looked elsewhere but could not find them.

When my boyfriend woke up, I asked him where my headphones were. He went into his son’s room and said he put them in his closet on accident, while cleaning around the house. His headphones were also in the closet. 

I honestly lost it. I told him I am so tired of having to question where my things are at. Our house is not cluttered. It is hardly messy. There is no reason for MY things not to be in OUR room. There is no reason for my things to be in someone else’s room. I told him that if I have something in one spot, he does not need to move it. My headphones being on the charger is not inconveniencing anyone. 

He said I am overreacting and it’s harmless to just go into his son’s room and look for something if I need too. He said that he accidentally / subconsciously moves things and doesn’t realize they are mine. 

I called bullshit, because this has been an issue for 2 years. I told him I am just not going to leave anything that is mine around the house anymore, not even a pair of shoes at the front door. 

I also do not like having to look in other peoples rooms or playing hide and seek with my things. I would hate for someone to look through my things/room. If he wants to put his stuff in his son’s room, by all means, do it. Which he does sometimes. But I told him to Stop. Putting. My. Stuff. In. There. 

I feel like an asshole just typing this. We have a great relationship and hardly argue. However, I have asked him in the past to please not do this, and he isn’t getting it.

11,1dn0sk4,AITA for telling my boyfriend to give me personal space when my social battery is low,"My (F24) boyfriend (M22) is a stereotypical ""golden retriever"" boyfriend. If I'm home, he wants to be in the same room as me at all times. Not only that but he is constantly talking to me and touching me even when I'm trying to work, do chores, or work on my hobbies. It is a lot. I'm autistic and super introverted so I NEED alone time and I need a fixed routine to function. Him interrupting my routines and alone time by getting in my path and asking me to hug him or whatever is really frustrating. I've tried to explain to him that it bothers me but he always takes it really personally. 

Today I went to hang out with my friends and when I came back, per my routine, I made dinner, watched tv while working on a hobby, and then I had to do some house work. During all of these activities, he wouldn't stop wrapping his arms around me while I was cooking and doing housework  (preventing me from moving around freely) and prompting me to say sweet things to him while I was watching tv or focusing on a difficult mental task. I was a little shorter with him than usual because my social battery was already low from being with friends all day. I didn't snap at him or anything, but I was maybe a little snarky. I apologized to him and explained why I needed space, and he was still taking it super personally. 

I want to make it clear, when we PLAN time together, I'm very attentive because I've mentally prepared for that time. We also plan for that multiple times per week. However, he has started randomly hanging around my house (I said this was ok if he gives me warning and doesn't interrupt my life) and expects me to be as attentive as I am during our planned time. Again, I've explained to him the difference between structured together time and times when we're just together because he showed up.
