0,1dn2opa,AITA for not calling my dad after he told me he had cancer?,"My dad (60s M) and me (20s M) have had a historically poor relationship (nothing crazy; I'm gay and he's an immigrant). BUT it's recently been getting a lot better since I've been going to grad school, he's been an empty nester, and my sister gave him grandkids. 

Recently, however, he gave me a call. Told me ""it's good news honestly"" and then proceeded to tell me he got diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, didn't tell anyone, had the prostate removed last week, and finally has the catheter out. The entire time he's chuckling and laughing and telling me he's feeling all good. I'm obviously extremely upset, but trying to comfort him and be shocked. I keep asking if he's ok and he keeps saying yes. 

To note: I just completed my FIRST YEAR of medical school. For those that don't know, this is a 90% lecture year. I work with dead bodies, and I'm not interested in surgery so I have done ZERO surgical shadowing/rotations. He was extremely chill, I made it clear that I wanted to be there for him, and he should talk to me if there's anything. Didn't mention any wounds, told me he's not on any medications, didn't mention anything about pain. 

Later, mom texted me and mt sister that we should reach out to our dad. We are not a family who calls each other, but here's where I probably was the asshole. Instead of directly asking ""how it's going?"" I started talking about a video game we both mutually like and he has been playing recently and I see him popping up on my steam. FOR CONTEXT we are not a really open or warm family. My dad and I would get into really bad arguements, he would never say the words ""I'm sorry,"" but he would buy me a gift I didn't like or come watch tv shows with me and my mom. I felt like opening about talking about the video game was the long-distance equivalent of sitting next to him and watching tv. I assumed part of the reason he didn't tell us he had cancer was because he didn't want our pity. 

Yesterday (about 5 days after he told us about the cancer) my mom texted me ""as a future doctor and current son you should reach out and ask your father about his recovery after the surgery."" I'm kind of like... WTF. Does he even want that? But fine. I ask him how it's going

Dad: it's going
Me: do you want to talk about it?
Him: if you want me to.
Me: of course!
Him: *16 hrs radio silence*
Me: I don't mean to pry, you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to
Dad: like I said, I don't mind talking about it to someone who asks.

We set up a time to call. 

Turns out prostate removal surgery SUCKS SHIT!! We had an hour chat and I apologized a lot, that I had no idea how he was feeling, I thought that he was genuinely doing ok. He kept responding like ""how could I be ok?"" After 30 minutes he started to warm up, but he and my mom are really making me feel like shit about it.

1,1dn2jt5,AITA for inviting my brother and niece to the circus? ,"I (31F) enjoy any chance I can get to spend with my brother Robert (35M) and my niece Cindy (4F). With it being summer, the circus has come to the area and it’s a good chance for the whole family to enjoy a day out. 

I will say, we don’t get along with Robert’s wife Kelly (34F). This stems from the fact that during COVID, she quit her job and my brother decided to pay all her prior school loans, debts, and bought her a new car as her old one kept breaking down. Our parents (64F and 65M) immigrated to America and saw Kelly’s behavior as being a gold-digger and using Robert for his money when they worked their way up in their career fields respectively. When we told Robert this, he told Kelly and needless to say, our relationship has been strained since then even with apologies and trying to move forward. This is Kelly’s right, and so we only really see her at holidays and sometimes birthdays. 

The problem lies in that our parents are still somewhat strained with Robert as well. I consider them to be the very prideful “we don’t want to beg to see him and Cindy” type of ppl. Because of this, they don’t always like me talking to Robert or believe there’s no reason to really talk to him since he spends 80-90% of time with Kelly’s side of the family and usually makes no effort to see us unless it’s a special occasion. I know Kelly is his wife and it makes sense to spend time with them. I just miss how close we were and I don’t want to further distance myself the way our parents have. 

We all will be in town this weekend and Dad mentioned buying tickets for the circus. Originally, he told me he would just buy 3 tickets for himself, Mom, and I but I overheard Mom say when I visited earlier in the month she would like Cindy to come just to see the event, but wouldn’t ask Robert as he is dictated by Kelly and her family. 

Robert FaceTimed me back on Friday with Cindy and after catching up, I decided to ask if he was free next weekend for the circus. He said he would check his calendar and later texted me he and Cindy could come. 

I told Dad today while visiting Robert is free to come to the circus too with Cindy. Though he hasn’t bought the tickets yet, he gave me this glare/frown and asked why I told Robert in the first place. I said I brought up when he FaceTimed me. He dropped it after that and I went back home. 

I feel like a bit of an asshole for going behind Dad, but I don’t want to purposely keep things from my brother just because we don’t really get along with his wife. 

Edit: Kelly works as admin at a nearby university, much less stressful for her she previously worked for United Airlines and quit right before COVID hit

2,1dn1xgs,AITA for leaving my two friends on holiday?,"
So I 20 F went on holiday with my best friend 21F and her two close friends, the dispute happened when we all agreed to book a taxi back to near our apartment and grab food before we went home. I booked the taxi expecting it to take a while, as they usually do… However it was accepted and in the pickup location instantly which we were 5 minutes away from. I told my friends to come with me because the taxi was here and proceeded to walk off, assuming they’d follow behind. When I arrived at the taxi I had already been charged a late fee as my free waiting time had expired, and the only person who had arrived with me was one of the other friends. My best friend and her friend were behind us by about a minute or two so we sat in the taxi to wait for them. Now, after drinking a lot that night I can’t exactly recall if the friend closed the door or the driver just started driving which closed the door, but nonetheless, it wasn’t me, and he drove off from our two friends. I instantly started shouting for him to stop and that there were two more people to wait for, however the driver didn’t stop until I ended up physically screaming at him to STOP. We didn’t make it too far down the road, so the other friend hung out the taxi and called out for our friends, who were nowhere to be seen. Considering we told the taxi we were waiting for more people, who weren’t there, he drove off again. I instantly call my friend with no answer, however she called the other girl I was with. We were met with screaming down the phone, “how could you leave us you’re tramps, etc etc”, and she wouldn’t listen to our explanation and hung up. 

I took it upon myself to message the group chat explaining what had happened to be met with the same abuse we received down the phone, said friend is adamant we could’ve waited (which we did) or should’ve got him to stop (which we also did, but he drove off again, without our permission). She keeps saying “you left us and got in a taxi without us”. And I get it, to her at the time it probably did look like that, however i’ve explained at least 10 times now that we tried to get him to stop and wait for them which he didn’t, and that we didn’t intend for him to just drive off…

She refused to talk to me for 2 days unless i apologised (amongst other spiteful things, which aren’t relevant to the story), which I haven’t, because I don’t see how I am personally at fault for what happened when I tried to do the right thing and wait for her. She still isn’t talking to me, and because of the uncomfortable atmosphere I left my holiday alone, early. 

In my eyes it was a misunderstanding that got perceived the wrong way. No one was left on their own, and we were only about 20 minutes away from our apartment. Her argument that leaving two people alone was wrong also quickly became redundant when my friend and the girl who was also left behind spent the next day together going out without us because she was giving us the silent treatment.

So am I in the wrong and do I owe my friend an apology??",Not the A-hole,2024-06-24,"AITA for leaving my two friends on holiday?

9,1dn0yyp,AITA for expecting my friends hike in the rain and wanting the best for them? ,"I 24M and my friends are fortunate enough to live in an area with a beautiful mountain with an infamous trail that’s difficult but rewarding to hike. We had originally planned to do this hike over the weekend as a bonding activity between the guys. 

The night before, one of my friends messaged the group chat that it was supposed to be pouring the next day and another suggested we postpone as a result. I told them a week before that rain or shine, we’d be going. My friend argued that he did not want to get his car wet and muddy after the hike to which I said wouldn’t be an issue if we just brought towels and an extra pair of shoes. My friends continued to argue that we should postpone or do something indoors, but I felt that they were just making excuses as they have done so in the past. I told them that unless there was something serious stopping them from going, then they need to stop making excuses and to go. For context，my friends have always had trouble committing to self-improvement plans and this situation was another symptom of that. I came to expect that they would try cancelling for some reason or another.

The conversation continued to grow more heated when my friend said “okay have fun by yourself then” and I countered by saying that “this is why they were the way [they] are right now.” The conversation then shifted as I explained that they were too soft and needed to learn that not everything always would go the way they wanted to. I mentioned that by showing up, they’re already better than the majority that would rather lie around at home playing games. My friend got upset, saying that not everything is a life lesson and that this wasn’t representative of life or their personalities. 

I told him I think he’s wrong and that it is indeed representative of life because the conditions for us to act will never be in our favour and that they’re simply making excuses to not do what’s good for us (ie. exercise). My friend continued to argue that I was resorting to personal attacks (since he enjoys sitting at home playing games) but I was just stating facts and at the end of the day just want all my friends to succeed and to be better than me.

10,1dn0vao,AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop putting my things in his son’s room?,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been together for 3+ years, living together for 2. He has a 13 year old son (had him when he was very young). He is at our house Friday night-Monday morning. 

Since we’ve moved in together, there has been an ongoing issue that my things end up in his son’s room, especially if he’s cleaning or moving stuff around. 

Last week, I came home from work and realized my PS5 was missing the HDMI cord. Sons room. Disconnected and on the floor. Because son was using it earlier and just unplugged it instead of putting it back. Which, he’s 13 and in his own world. My boyfriend let him borrow it, so he should have put it back when son was done. 
Side note, I bought his son a couple of cords so my BF would stop taking mine for him to use. No idea what happened to them. 

The other day, I was looking for my dogs combing supplies. She has her own cabinet of “dog stuff.” They somehow ended up in his son’s room. He said he was reorganizing the cabinet and took some things out, and he must have moved the comb in the process. 

Today, my boyfriend was taking a nap and I was going to go to the gym. I could not find my headphones. They are usually in my gym bag, but I had taken them out to charge earlier today. 

I looked in his son’s room but did not see them, so I looked elsewhere but could not find them.

When my boyfriend woke up, I asked him where my headphones were. He went into his son’s room and said he put them in his closet on accident, while cleaning around the house. His headphones were also in the closet. 

I honestly lost it. I told him I am so tired of having to question where my things are at. Our house is not cluttered. It is hardly messy. There is no reason for MY things not to be in OUR room. There is no reason for my things to be in someone else’s room. I told him that if I have something in one spot, he does not need to move it. My headphones being on the charger is not inconveniencing anyone. 

He said I am overreacting and it’s harmless to just go into his son’s room and look for something if I need too. He said that he accidentally / subconsciously moves things and doesn’t realize they are mine. 

I called bullshit, because this has been an issue for 2 years. I told him I am just not going to leave anything that is mine around the house anymore, not even a pair of shoes at the front door. 

I also do not like having to look in other peoples rooms or playing hide and seek with my things. I would hate for someone to look through my things/room. If he wants to put his stuff in his son’s room, by all means, do it. Which he does sometimes. But I told him to Stop. Putting. My. Stuff. In. There. 

I feel like an asshole just typing this. We have a great relationship and hardly argue. However, I have asked him in the past to please not do this, and he isn’t getting it.

11,1dn0sk4,AITA for telling my boyfriend to give me personal space when my social battery is low,"My (F24) boyfriend (M22) is a stereotypical ""golden retriever"" boyfriend. If I'm home, he wants to be in the same room as me at all times. Not only that but he is constantly talking to me and touching me even when I'm trying to work, do chores, or work on my hobbies. It is a lot. I'm autistic and super introverted so I NEED alone time and I need a fixed routine to function. Him interrupting my routines and alone time by getting in my path and asking me to hug him or whatever is really frustrating. I've tried to explain to him that it bothers me but he always takes it really personally. 

Today I went to hang out with my friends and when I came back, per my routine, I made dinner, watched tv while working on a hobby, and then I had to do some house work. During all of these activities, he wouldn't stop wrapping his arms around me while I was cooking and doing housework  (preventing me from moving around freely) and prompting me to say sweet things to him while I was watching tv or focusing on a difficult mental task. I was a little shorter with him than usual because my social battery was already low from being with friends all day. I didn't snap at him or anything, but I was maybe a little snarky. I apologized to him and explained why I needed space, and he was still taking it super personally. 

I want to make it clear, when we PLAN time together, I'm very attentive because I've mentally prepared for that time. We also plan for that multiple times per week. However, he has started randomly hanging around my house (I said this was ok if he gives me warning and doesn't interrupt my life) and expects me to be as attentive as I am during our planned time. Again, I've explained to him the difference between structured together time and times when we're just together because he showed up.

16,1dnr9lj,AITA for leaving a concert without telling my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend [26m] and I [23f] planned on attending a concert together. Unfortunately, he got super busy with work at the last second, and said he wouldn’t be able to leave with me, but would meet me during the show once his call ended.

A couple things worth mentioning:

First, the band we planned on seeing is my favorite band, but not music my boyfriend listens to. He was going to go with me just to spend time together because we’re in a long distance relationship, which was super nice. I’ve attended concerts alone before and had no problem doing so again, but he insisted.

Second, we got into a bit of an argument before I left for the show, unrelated to the event or his work call. He said some things and acted in a way that hurt my feelings, though he said he wasn’t trying to be mean or make me upset. I was crying a bit as I left for the show, but was determined not to let this affect my excitement for the band or the rest of our time together.

I let him know when I arrived, and after not hearing anything for an hour, texted him when the band only had a few songs left to play. My boyfriend said he was still on his call.

The next text I get from him (45 mins later) is “Where are you?”

I was walking back to the hotel and told him so. I wanted to walk a ways and then catch a taxi since everyone was ordering cars around the venue, causing traffic. By this point, I was 1km from the venue.

He said, “I’m here,” meaning at the venue.

I was super confused because he hadn’t mentioned anything about getting ready and coming over. He then got mad because I didn’t tell him the show was over, or that I’d left.

The plan *was* to meet at the venue, but since he was still working when there were only a few songs left, I assumed he wouldn’t make it (which was a little disappointing, but not his fault).

I think I am partially to blame because, sure, I definitely could have told him the show had ended and I was heading back. I didn’t bc I was still a bit hurt from earlier and wanted a little time to myself. I think my boyfriend holds more of the blame because he didn’t even tell me he was done, or heading over.

We grew up in a very rough area, lived in an absolutely decrepit house with mould on an estate that constantly had the police round. 

Noel, I don't even know how, somehow managed to get on an A-level course and then get into a very prestigious Russell group uni, despite not having studied a day in his life. Our mam tried to discourage him and get him to do an apprenticeship as an electrician or something of the sort, but he refused and he studied fine art for three years.  He gets work here and there, and we still live in a rough neighborhood despite his degree, we literally have a teeny  2bedroom flat.

Through work, he managed to meet his girlfriend, Nadia (F28). She's one of those people who were privately educated, had life handed to them on a platter by mummy and daddy and still think they need to have a pathetic rebellion. In Nadia's case, that's getting knocked up by Noel, who her parents treat as if he scum because he's got a thick northern accent and isn't middle class, and through trying her best to emulate working class lasses.

The first time I saw her, I giggled, like it was just so obvious that she was a posh girlie playing pretend. She's half moved in into our flat since finding out that she's pregnant, and that's made her play it up even more.

I laughed at her and said that you can't be elitist about poverty, which led her on to ranting about class in this self righteous manner. I ended up yelling over her that she needs to fucking stop talking in that accent and stop trying to rebel against mummy and daddy, pointing out that she's a fully grown woman.

My mom thinks this is childish of me and disapproves whenever she catcges me watching it. So i watch it in my room or when she is outside.

I was watching cartoons in my living room because my mom was outside and thought she was coming home at around 6-7pm as that is the time sge usually comes home during the weekdays, when at 5pm she came home with her friends, i didnt know that and they saw me watching regular show, my mom didnt sya it verbally but by the way of her eye i knew she was mad. I quickly shut off the TV and apologized and quickly ran to my room. I have literally never been more embarrassed.

After her friends left after they had some wine and talked for a long time, my mom came to my room while i was scrolling on my phone. I said sorry and said i didnt know her friends were coming, but she was silent, she took my phone, my laptop, my tablet, and the remote of my tv. She took and left. I was obviously mad at shouted at her, she felt just a little bad so she gave me back my phone.

I complained this to my dad and my dad said to respect my phone and how i knew she didnt like me watch cartoons, so i made a letter for her since she has been ignoring and not wanting to talk to me lately. But it didnt do anything.

I know she is overreacting but i am second guessing myself, i knew she didnt like me watching cartoons.

25,1dnq7ia,AITA for partying in Vegas right after my husband's grandfather passed away?,"I was in Vegas for a week last week (Saturday - Saturday) with my close friend who is also a girl who I haven't seen in a while. 4 days into the trip (On wednesday) I get a call from my husband saying that his grandfather suddenly passed away, I tried to check flights but I am tight on money and could not afford to fly back earlier which I thought was fine because the funeral was on Sunday and I checked in with my husband via text and call as much as possible during the trip.

So since I was in vegas I did end up going out with my friend and doing stuff the next few days (including partying/going to bars/club etc) but limited my drinking in case my husband needed me and I wanted to be alert.

Out of respect I posted nothing to social media because I know how that would look but apparently my MIL has been freaking out (it's my FIL's father who passed away just for additional context) and on Sunday she verbally berated me in front of everyone after the funeral and said it was disgusting that I had such little respect for their family that I was out partying in Vegas instead of coming to be with the family. My husband's aunts also ganged up on me and even went as far as to imply some things.

It was pretty messy because my mom heard all of this and she began yelling at his mom to defend me but I told her to relax i appreciate her and that I got this .  

I understood his mom and aunt were maybe grieving so I didn't argue back with them and tried to calmy explain my side of the story but AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-24,"AITA for partying in Vegas right after my husband's grandfather passed away?

26,1dnq6pw,AITA for telling off a lady for assuming I'm homeless?,"Edit: I was wearing gray slim Adidas joggers (the thin breathable ones) with white Jordan slides, and a white v-neck. My head is shaved, and I have a trimmed goatee. I'm in Harlem right now near the Metro North stop and this look is very common. I can confidently say the homeless people dress a certain way and it's not this.

I (23M) grew up in an area where people my age don't really care about fashion. We wear sweatpants, shorts, pajamas, etc. Even if it's somewhere like Olive Garden. That's pretty much how every Indiana town is. I personally wear sweats or pajamas this time of year paired with Crocs or slides, usually paired with a shirt from one of my favorite shows or singers.

I'm staying with my friend in NYC for a few days. I arrived the other night and I Doordashed some Burger King. Then yesterday, when my friend was at work, I went out to walk around because I've never been somewhere with actual sidewalks lol. I ordered from the Taco Bell across the street and left my phone to charge. I got there, and it was taking a while so I just sat around in a booth. This lady walked up to me, introduced herself, and asked if I needed something to eat. I went, ""Um, I already ordered. Why?"" She said she was with some homeless youth outreach program, and I asked her why she would possibly think I'm homeless. She apologized, and I told her she was literally profiling me and it was making me feel uncomfortable. She apologized again and walked away. I grabbed my food, and on the way out, this old lady said I was ""very nasty"" to that woman, and that I shouldn't dress like this if I don't want people to think I'm homeless. I ignored her and went back to my friend's place.

I told my friend what happened when she got home, and she said that most people in her neighborhood don't dress like that even if they're running into Trade Fair at 2 AM. I told her I noticed that people here are really dressy, but that it wasn't my style. She went, ""Well that old lady isn't wrong. You look like you just rolled out of bed. You could dress a little nicer."" I just sighed and locked myself in the bathroom because I was feeling really upset.

27,1dnq5qv,AITA For Telling my Friend his Passion will take him nowhere,"I (21m) told my friend (21m) to stop focusing on his hobby because it would take him nowhere.

So for quick context, this all started about six months ago when my friend, J, decided to start taking his passion for music seriously. He told me on the way to a party that he would have less time to hang out with me and our friends. While it did upset me, I understood that it was what he wanted to do and made him happy. When we got there I began to make myself comfortable. I started drinking and became black-out drunk. I was biting a bit more than I could chew and it was my mistake. I admit that.

According to J, I started to vomit and cuss him out. Eventually, he brought me to the bathroom to try and help me. He says that while I was cleaning up I started to trash his passion and told him to quit. After that, I kept on leaving the bathroom and coming back to vomit and cuss my friend out.

The next day I woke up hung-over but still had to go to my job (where a lot of our mutual friends also work.) When I clocked in everybody started acting weird. I quickly realized that I did something stupid the night before, but nobody was telling me. Eventually, I went to my friend J but he just said I ‘did him dirty’ and refused to say anything after that. The sudden ghost started to make me feel stressed as we were close friends, so I repeatedly messaged him to see what I had done. He still wasn’t responding so I decided to buy him flowers with a card asking him to respond to my messages. I let myself into his backyard and texted him saying I left him a gift. 

After that, he retold the whole story and I fell to my knees. I immediately apologized. Despite that, he still cut all ties with me. We were still in the same group and had a lot of mutual friends, so I’d still see him around. I would try to speak to him but he would act cold to me, and would only give me one-word answers. I also noticed that a lot of our other friends would act weird to me as well and seemed like they didn’t want me around. 

At that point, it was obvious everybody knew what happened. Every time I would hang out with them I felt like a background character. There was always this weird vibe that made everybody uncomfortable. I became mad at J because I felt like it was all coming from him. Valentine’s Day came around so to let out my grievances I sent to the group chat “Pushing love today. Even to those that don’t deserve it” directed to J. After I sent that the group chat blew up and we decided to come together to hash things out. 

While I thought it was going to be a good opportunity for us to let everything out, it just turned into J shitting on me the whole time with some people chiming in to give their two cents. I started to become emotional and even let out some tears. Two of our friends tried to make me feel better, but it seemed everybody concluded that I was the asshole. So Reddit, am I the asshole? To be honest, I don’t even want to be friends with J anymore. Not after everything.

Since everyone liked it so much, I(26m) decided to ask if some people would like to come over to play the game together to see where the story goes from the end of season 1. A couple co-workers agreed, and they came over one day. 

One co-worker left after a bit, but the other ""Mina"" (30f) stayed a bit longer. All was well until we got to THAT part of the game. I won't say what part exactly to avoid spoilers, but basically there is a huge plot development in the opening hours of the game. 

Mina was not happy that I spoiled the second season of the show for her by letting her see that scene, and to this day over a year later, she still gets worked up about it. 

I don't think her anger is warranted, since she agreed to come over and play the game, so clearly she knew she would be experiencing the plot. But her point of view is that she didn't expect such a huge plot development in the opening hours of the game, and I should've known that she wouldn't want to know that.

29,1dnpqav,AITA for being angry about my mom's weird gay friendship rules?,"I (17f) have been (bi) for about my whole life. My parents sort of guessed it at first and I didn't really have to come out to them because they accepted me. I haven't had many friends so they are always excited when (once in a blue moon) I invite or am invited to hang out with some. My parents have historically been reasonable about staying the night at other people's homes; (only staying if they know the people well). But also have, in the past, let me sleep over at mutual friend's houses even if they don't know the parents (so long as the kid whose parents they know is there). 

During the first few years of high school, my friendships started to gravitate towards kids I could relate to (often queer or had nerdy interests). However, my parents still expressed their preferences for my friends to be 'normal.' Also, we don't have a guest room and our house isn't big enough to sleep more than one extra person. For those reasons, I almost never had any friends stay the night and certainly never more than one. When I did have a gay friend over, I was instructed to keep within sight of my family.

When I asked my mom if I could spend the night with two other girls, (one of them is gay one of them is straight) she denied. She knows the parents of one girl, I asked her a week in advance, and there are three  of us total. She claims that sleeping in the same room as another gay girl is equivalent to a straight girl and boy. I tried to argue that no, it isn't the same. She also knows I have no interest in either person. 

What makes this even worse is that a few weeks ago, she allowed me to sleep in the same tent with three other boys unsupervised. With this double standard, I really don't think these aren't good reasons for keeping me from my friends.

30,1dnpomf,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to go over my schedule with me and also getting frustrated with him for poorly communicating with me?,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (28F) share a car currently because we’re low income but it’s his car so usually he drops me off places. I’m taking 4 classes this fall two being online, two being on campus but also two different campuses on different days. I figured I’d write my schedule down now and look it over to make things easier and less confusing for the fall. I asked him if we could go over the schedule together since he’d be the one dropping me off at my classes come this fall.

He seemed to have a problem doing this because he suggested we go over it while going for a walk when he knows I hate multi-tasking when I’m trying to have an important conversation as I’ve stated this before.. plus who wants to be looking down at their phone the whole entire time they’re on a walk?

He agrees to go over it after walking the dog and I was sitting on the couch texting a friend. He walks in and states from the nearby kitchen “I’m just getting a drink, get it ready” as I’m texting my friend. I’m already annoyed because he seems like he doesn’t want to do it but now I’m extra annoyed because I’ve already communicated with him before that I can’t stand when he tells me to get things ready that don’t need to be “gotten ready” I was trying to explain myself but he wasn’t seeming to get it and I was honestly losing my patience at this point but basically explained it to him like this 

“If you’re gonna use the oven to cook you need to “get it ready” because it takes time to preheat. If you’re going to use your car but it’s too hot out you need to “get the car ready” because it takes time for the car to get cooler. HOWEVER the first note in my phone takes less than 5 seconds to pull up therefore it’s unnecessary to “get it ready”

 he then admitted that he didn’t really care to go over my schedule anyways and stated “it’s your schedule and it’s summer why do we have to go over it again?”

I explained that I thought it’d be nice if we started to plan ahead and discuss the schedule together since it’s way more complicated than last semester’s schedule he kept confusing. I should also mention he’s been on worker’s comp for almost 2 years so he currently doesn’t work or go to school so it’s not like he was too busy to sit down and go over something that wasn’t going to take long.

He kept telling me I was getting way too heated over these issues and I admit I was getting loud and a little frustrated at certain points during the conversation but there were so many things I kept having to explain and point out to him and most of the things were stuff we had already talked about before and we’ve been together eight years so I was frustrated I had to explain them to him like he was five he stated that if I made a Reddit post about this there’d be people claiming we’re both right because it’s just a matter of opinion I said I’d make one his response was “Go ahead I don’t care about the opinions of strangers. You know this.”

He still thinks I’m in the wrong..

So Reddit, AITA here??

EDIT: Wish some of y’all would have taken into consideration that he admitted that he didn’t want to do it anyways which I could easily subconsciously pick up on which is what initially  caused me to get annoyed. Y’all are saying I’m a bad communicator but if he had just said from the beginning that he’d rather do it later on that night after dinner I would have been fine with that. I also explained numerous times that last semester he only had to remember that my one day on campus was Wednesdays at 3:30 and he’d often get confused and think it was Monday. We live together and my semester was from January-May. I’m sorry that after several weeks/months of him constantly having to ask me which day I was on campus it did start to get stressful/ annoying after a while. My schedule is way more complex this term and all I wanted to go over with him was the two days I’d be at different campuses I even split the first full time term half online and half on campus so it’d be less driving on him. I was going to give him a copy of the schedule as well and just politely explain to him how annoying it is for him to constantly be coming to me about the schedule he should have and I also wanted to go over a few things that might help us come this fall when I’m way busier but still trying to do most of the house chores myself while he’s still jobless and not in school due to his circumstances.. as the busier person I just wanted to get a game plan going to best prepare us both. 

My classes start in two months and I had been looking at my college email and my list of classes and just decided to write it down in my notes which made me want to just go over it with him and he didn’t seem to care to do that.

He’s been on workers comp for two years due to a work accident and I’ve done my very best to be an emotional support for him. I’ve always done all the cooking, the majority of the cleaning, and I was just getting anxious about being a full time college student this fall because as I’ve already mentioned in some of the comments although I’m an A student I do find school to be a lot because of my ADHD. 

I understand it’s not my partner’s responsibility to manage my ADHD or anything I do that on my own but he’s been injured since August of 2022 and I’ve been by his side helping him as much as I can. Does it not go both ways? I’ve also gone to therapy he’s refused therapy all 8 years of our relationship up until recently he finally said he’d go because I’ve been asking him to go for years but even more so recently since he injury has made him angry and a little bitter at times and his mom also begged him to go the ask time she saw him. 

So y’all think I’m the asshole.. in all honesty I don’t feel I was fully seen throughout this post and I’m thankful for the person that messaged me who also has ADHD and a similar situation as they gave helpful insight. I did share with my boyfriend what people were saying on here. He was gloating and rubbing it in my face until I pointed out that he was doing that.

I was going to give him a copy of the schedule as well and just politely explain to him how annoying it is for him to constantly be coming to me about the schedule he should have and I also wanted to go over a few things that might help us come this fall when I’m way busier but still trying to do most of the house chores myself while he’s still jobless and not in school due to his circumstances.. as the busier person I just wanted to get a game plan going to best prepare us both. 

My classes start in two months and I had been looking at my college email and my list of classes and just decided to write it down in my notes which made me want to just go over it with him and he didn’t seem to care to do that.

He’s been on workers comp for two years due to a work accident and I’ve done my very best to be an emotional support for him. I’ve always done all the cooking, the majority of the cleaning, and I was just getting anxious about being a full time college student this fall because as I’ve already mentioned in some of the comments although I’m an A student I do find school to be a lot because of my ADHD. 

I understand it’s not my partner’s responsibility to manage my ADHD or anything I do that on my own but he’s been injured since August of 2022 and I’ve been by his side helping him as much as I can. Does it not go both ways? I’ve also gone to therapy he’s refused therapy all 8 years of our relationship up until recently he finally said he’d go because I’ve been asking him to go for years but even more so recently since he injury has made him angry and a little bitter at times and his mom also begged him to go the ask time she saw him. 

So y’all think I’m the asshole.. in all honesty I don’t feel I was fully seen throughout this post and I’m thankful for the person that messaged me who also has ADHD and a similar situation as they gave helpful insight. I did share with my boyfriend what people were saying on here. He was gloating and rubbing it in my face until I pointed out that he was doing that. ",1.0,0.9734801054000854,1,1
31,1dnpnx3,AITA for standing up to my stingy friend?,"I (22f) and my best friend (22f) are in a bit of a tuff and I need help deciding what the best course of action is. 

I will start by saying my best friend has always been a bit stingy and I know that about her so it doesn’t really bother me anymore. Examples of this would be, not tipping at bars and generally just being stingy and weird with money. With my other friends, I will buy something one time and the next time they will, but with her, we always just pay for our own things. That’s ok though, not the issue. 

The issue that has come up is that we both enjoy 420 activities and the place where I get it gives me a good deal because we are close friends so I tend to buy it. When I buy it, she says she will pay me for some but never has. She lives close by so she is smoking it daily and has even asked to take a bit when I left for vacay. Now even though she says that she will pay me, I never ask her for money because she is so weird with it and I honestly don’t really mind because I enjoy having someone to smoke with. 

I feel kind of hurt though because we went out the other night and the bar was very packed so when she got to the bar, I asked if she would just put my drink on her tab and I would send her money since the bartender got to her first. We stayed out late and I forgot to send her the seven dollars or whatever it was ( I left a tip on the bar btw because I had cash I knew she wasn’t going to tip💀). The next day though, she called me asking when I was going to be home because she wanted to smoke and then asked me for the seven dollars. 

Now, this might be where I am the asshole because I did say I would send her money however, I found it honestly really rude that she asked for that when I don’t think she was ever intending to pay for any of the 🍃 she smoked for the last couple months+. When I questioned her about it, she started bringing up times that she had brought over an angry orchard hard cider for us when we smoked, Or when she offered me a piña colada at her house before going out to the bar. She felt like that equated to the $50+ amount of 🍃 she used. She also mentioned she didn’t understand why she had to beg for the seven dollars when I work two jobs but I work so much because I have bills and she does not. Anyway it all really rubbed me the wrong way, but we are very close friends and have hung out all the time for years so I just wanted to hear what y’all thought and what you would do if you were in this situation?",No A-holes here,2024-06-24,"AITA for standing up to my stingy friend?

33,1dnpeqb,AITA for taking my legal inheritance from Stepmom?," I 29F recently lost Dad to a terminal brain tumour. Given 6-12 months to live, he wasted away to nothing, lost his ability to read, walk eat solid food or go to the loo, and for very confused . We were losing a piece of him everyday, grieving before we'd lost him.

Dad lived abroad with Stepmom Jenny and our sisters (teens). Bro (27) flew out when he could, and I worked overtime to see him. I worked 7 days a week to pay for a simple wedding so Dad could come. 4 weeks before wedding, Dad told he can't fly. Fiance offers to drive several thousand miles to pick Dad up, but he's too ill. Bro filmed the wedding, and I flew out after with the tape to see Dad. Bro spent his last Christmas with him.

We flew out for his funeral and many times after to see Jenny and our sisters. We'd never got on with Jenny, but his cancer brought us together to realise what was important (or so I thought).

Jenny was our Stepmom since we were 10 and 8. She'd slag off Mom, and be nasty to Bro. I'd defend Bro, Dad stayed away as hated conflict. I disliked Jenny even when I left home. When She met my now husband but then BF of 6 months she spent 2 hours telling him how awful i was - i couldn't say anything as in a foreign country with no where else to go. When Dad got ill we supported and cared for him and eachother, until now.

A company contacts me regarding Dad's Will. Jenny told me he didn't have a Will, and I never questioned her getting everything as they were married. I ask Jenny for a copy and no response.

Brother calls me, confused and upset. He'd called Jenny to ask what was going on with the Will/Pension. They spoke nicely for 50mins, but when he asks Jenny flips and screeches: Don't you dare try to make a claim, you will ruin this family! I'll have to get a job sooner!

Jenny didn't work, understandably, when Dad was ill, but he died over a year ago and she hasn't worked since. Our sisters are independent, they cook, walk to school and have a key. She could work if she wanted to, and did full time before Dad was ill.

Jenny messages calling us greedy. Say how traumatic Dad's illness was for her and our sisters (as if it wasn't for us) and that if we took the money we're stealing, that as ""adult children"" it's odd to think we're entitled to anything from Dad. I nearly cry when I see her message.

Bro says this whole situation is odd, and believes Jenny is hiding our inheritance. Still haven't seen the Will so don't know if we have been left anything. If Jenny had come to us and asked for our inheritance if she was struggling, we would have helped. But all the lying ""there's no Will"" and ""You're not in it"" and then not showing us the Will makes me want to know what she's hiding.

My younger brother (13M) is treated so differently to me when I was that age. He’s allowed to do whatever and say whatever without consequences. He was recently caught drinking in a field (it’s quite common in the uk to be drinking at this age despite not being of legal drinking age) with some of our neighbours who were of legal drinking age by another neighbour and my parents never said a thing yet I asked to go to my best friends birthday party for a few hours and I was told no cause they were would be alcohol despite me being over the legal age. I was recently talking to my aunt about how to stand up to my parents more and she joked that I should just come live with her but now I think I might take her up on the offer cause my parents clearly won’t let me live my life.

Later, she texted our group chat asking if we were mad at her. We were frustrated because at gatherings, Lisa often ignores us—she'll make eye contact but won't say hello.

When she confronted us about why we were upset, we told her honestly how we felt. She kept insisting she hadn't seen us and even tried to dismiss our feelings by calling us old. We explained that for a casual hangout, it's really up to her sister or sister-in-law to let her know, not us.

Now, in another group chat where I'm the only one from our circle, Lisa is throwing shade, suggesting we didn't follow through with our separate plan to go out with a smaller group because of the backlash she had received. This bothered me because she's discussing it where none of the other girls can respond. I got annoyed and threw some shade back, reminding her pointedly that she wasn't invited to our casual hangout. I know she would not have said that if the other girls were in the chat.

39,1dnnxlq,AITA for dropping out from being maid of honour a month before the wedding?,"To start with, my friend asked me to her maid of honour during her second wedding - she already got ‘office’ married two years ago and now they’re doing it again but this time in church (she has a different maid of honour back then).
Me and the bride were best friends as kids however our bond isn’t as strong anymore. To be completely honest we don’t have anything in common anymore, not much trust (at least on my side), even the conversations are awkward if there’re not about the wedding. It feels like we outgrew each other at this point.
 
The main reason I want to quit is her behaviour towards me. Recently we came back from her bachelorette trip which I planned on my own because all her friends ignored my questions on the group chat I’ve created. She barely spoke to me and even then we managed to argue twice. The whole trip was all she asked for and more - and because she asked for a lot and i had to keep the budget low I paid for a lot from my own pocket. This wasn’t a problem to me until she threw a hissy fit in the club i’ve already paid for because she (and her 3 other friends) didn’t like the music and threatened to leave. They would also spend most of the time either outside or next to the table. (Mind you, the club I had to pick on my own, was the most popular one in that city with regular club music). Every person who ever had to plan something like that understands the pain of it and seeing how ungrateful she was made me cry even though I’m not a cryer.

She’s been making smaller or bigger comments that made me feel upset and worthless ever since I agreed to be her moh.  Another thing that bothered me was how invasive she was. She would try to call me almost every day to talk about the stuff we already agreed on or about the things not even related to the wedding that i had to ask about just to fill the uncomfortable silence. She would also never ask about me or my life or anything literally- even though she knew I was fighting depression and having issues with my dad. Whenever I couldn’t pick up she would give out to me about it later. She honestly made me scared to check my phone sometimes.

She also owes me a lot of money for little favours I’ve been doing for her - like buying her daughter two dresses for the wedding etc. She honestly thinks that I’m rich because I’ve moved out of my country and can afford it (which I don’t).

The only reason why I was chosen as a replacement for her last maid of honour that comes to my mind is either her mom (she was always very fond of me) or my supposed fortune 😂

Either way we are a month away from the wedding and I honestly don’t think I can be a part of it. I also don’t want to waste more money on it. The friendship we used to have is almost not existent at this point so it’s not like I’m gonna loose my best friend.

I have two kids, 4&2. Since they’ve been born my grandma has come over to see them once or twice, and my dad a handful of times. Other than that they (mainly my grandma) expect me to go to their house. For one, it’s a lot easier for them to come to me where I have toys, snacks, and all their essentials. Plus it’s a lot easier than loading up 2 kids to go somewhere. On top of that, their house smells so bad. They have probably 6-7 cats, not including the feral ones that live in their garage, and 3 dogs. The house smells like litter box and animal. It’s so bad that when I leave their house me and my kids smell like it and have to go home and immediately shower. And on top of it all, their house is SO hot. My poor kids get so sweaty in there. 

My grandma never texts or calls to check up on them.

41,1dnnmmv,AITA for telling my husband that his daughter might let him down once again?,"Me (47F) and my husband (47M) have been married for a year. We have known each other for 10 years, at first we were just friends. He divorced his ex-wife six years ago. His ex-wife isn't a bad person, but they weren't right for each other, so they often had arguments. Eventually they got divorced. Two years after their divorce, we started dating.

My husband has a daughter (24F) with his ex-wife. She stopped talking to him after the divorce, and she had already turned 18 by then. His daughter didn't want them to get divorced at all. According to my husband, he never tried to empathize with them during the divorce process. Since my husband was the one who filed for divorce and took the first step, she stopped talking to him.

My husband tried a lot to talk to her during this time, but after a while, when his daughter moved to a different city for college, they drifted apart. His daughter continued to talk to her mother. My husband would call her from time to time and check in with her about her daughter.

Two weeks ago his daughter called him and said she wanted to talk. They met the very next day. She regretted that she had not spoken to him all these years and wanted to make things right between them. After graduating, she worked in that city for a year but was fired and went back home. Now that she was here, she wanted to see him often.

Of course he agreed and was very happy. I showed him support, I bought a Goldeneye pinot noir and gave it to him as a gift. We drank it together and celebrated. For two weeks they went to the movies, went camping, went out to dinner. And I'm really happy for them.

Yesterday evening, he and I were chatting together again. He was talking about the conversation he had with his daughter and I was listening to him.

At this point he saw my face fall and asked me what I was thinking. I told him that what he was going through was very good, he just had to be prepared for the bad.

42,1dnnitl,AITA for using my birthday gift for myself?,"A bit of background...

40F living with my 50M boyfriend for almost two years. Together four. He has twin daughters, 17 yo.

My bf shares custody of his twin girls. Mom lives across town. Everything is amicable but I don't have a relationship with the girls' mom beyond ""hi, how are you?"" pleasantries. The girls and I get along just fine as well, but they have both their parents so I'm certainly not in that role for them. 

The girl's prom was a couple months ago. So was my birthday. For my birthday, the twins scheduled to have my vehicle professionally detailed. I was a bit surprised as their mother has never chipped in on anything they've ever gifted me, but she helped organize and pay for the gift. However, it all made sense when they almost immediately afterward asked to drive my vehicle with their dates to prom.

I've never been married, nor do I have any kids of my own, so the house we live in and the automobile I drive were all purchases from the perspective of a single person with a good job and no dependents - it doesn't matter what it is specifically, but it's not an inexpensive vehicle. It's not something I want a pack of High School Seniors and their dates running around town in. I told the girls I would rent them a limo or some other type of vehicle with a driver, but I wasn't comfortable with them taking mine.

They were upset, so their dad told them he would talk to me and talk to them about it again. I reiterated to him that I wasn't comfortable with it and the topic, so I thought, was dropped.

I had a weird feeling, however. I was set to be working out-of-state over prom, so I rescheduled the detail to where I dropped my vehicle off before I flew out and wouldn't pick it back up again until after I got back. 

When my bf got home with the twins that night, they immediately called and asked me where my vehicle was. They were upset when I told them. I had already said no to them taking it, so the only reason to be upset was if they were planning on doing it without my permission - when I talked to my bf later that evening, he shrugged my feeling of being lied to off by saying it's obvious that they got the birthday gift for me as a goodwill gesture for borrowing the vehicle, and I was the jerk for making sure they weren't able to, but still taking the gift. Apparently, the girls' mother was also upset and feeling ""ripped off.""

I would get where everyone was coming from if the twins had offered to detail the vehicle in exchange for using it, but this was given to me as a birthday gift before they even discussed borrowing anything. So AITA?

I (17m) and my sibling (14, “Riley”) usually have a good relationship, but we often get into arguments over stories I or them write. My sibling had always tried writing a story, but never fully committed to one. It always ended up only as cool ideas which never got fleshed out.

Also, I think it is good to mention that I regualy write stories, I did it since 6th grade (I am currently ending my 1st year in highscholl). I am also decent in drawing my own characters, which is why I like writing stories. I suspect she could be jealous of me, even though they have their own cool skills.

For example, Riley could have a cool idea about a dragon, but cannot decide if they should be huge or not. Instead of deciding on one or the other, they throw other ideas on top of it, but without actualy deciding. I always tried to help them whenever they asked, but it usualy ended up in arguing about minor details.

Now to the main thing. Riley thought it would be funny if they gave me a few ideas and I would write an entire story of them. I agreed to the challenge, which suprised them, but they willingly gave me a few ideas. A few days ago was the first time I started to think about the possible story based of their ideas.

That day I called Riley to my room to choose one name out of two without a context for fun, since I could not decide (if you are curious, those names were Calogero and Salvador) for one of the characters.

She said no to both names. When I asked her why, she said ""it did not align with their vision, that they sounded stupid"". After that we ended up arguing about my other ideas. When Riley told me they did not like any, I offered ""hey, if you want a say on the story, then we can work together"", but they did not want to.

Like, I swear to god, Riley got mad over details like ""oh, I (me) thought it would be cool if the sun was blue"", but Riley said ""it does not make sense"" (even though her story idea was in the scifi/fantasy realm)

Then they got mad, left and not spoke about it since.

Now I feel conflicted if I even want to continue in this writing challenge or not. Like, would I be stupid if I did so? I am not sure, this is not the first time we argued about stupid things like this and I feel as if I am going mad over it.

That is it. Judge me, because if I am the a--hole, then I would like to know.

46,1dnmoiw,AITA for telling my wife that the only reason our son is interested in her culture  is because of some boy?,"My wife is indigenous and I'm white.Our son ""Keith"" (15M) as much as she's wanted him to be has never really been interested in her culture or her side of his heritage. He'd always preferred spending time with me playing sports.He generally only ever comes with her to visit his grandparents on the rez once or twice during the summer before football camp cause she makes him.

This summer after the first time he apparently made friends with some kids there and decided to keep going with her and now all of a sudden he's interested in learning his heritage. He even tells me he wants to skip football camp this year something he loves. So I decided over the weekend that'd I'd go with him to see  what's got him all interested.

I meet his friends while there and I watch them play basketball. I notice how he is with one tall boy "" Dakota"" (15 or 16) in particular. Blushing and being shy and kinda flirty and Dakota being the same way back. They even went off on a walk  alone after the game.I realized then that all of this is just so he can see this Dakota kid. Of course I'm upset because hes supposed to getting ready for the season and possibly getting attention from scouts and hrs waiting his time for some boy.

My wife notices I'm upset later and I tell her that Keith is wasting his time Here. She gets upset asking what I meant and i tell her that Keith could get scouted and he should be at camp and training. She says maybe he doesn't want that and he wants to learn who he is.

My wife is indigenous and I'm white.Our son ""Keith"" (15M) as much as she's wanted him to be has never really been interested in her culture or her side of his heritage. He'd always preferred spending time with me playing sports.He generally only ever comes with her to visit his grandparents on the rez once or twice during the summer before football camp cause she makes him.

This summer after the first time he apparently made friends with some kids there and decided to keep going with her and now all of a sudden he's interested in learning his heritage. He even tells me he wants to skip football camp this year something he loves. So I decided over the weekend that'd I'd go with him to see  what's got him all interested.

I meet his friends while there and I watch them play basketball. I notice how he is with one tall boy "" Dakota"" (15 or 16) in particular. Blushing and being shy and kinda flirty and Dakota being the same way back. They even went off on a walk  alone after the game.I realized then that all of this is just so he can see this Dakota kid. Of course I'm upset because hes supposed to getting ready for the season and possibly getting attention from scouts and hrs waiting his time for some boy.

My wife notices I'm upset later and I tell her that Keith is wasting his time Here. She gets upset asking what I meant and i tell her that Keith could get scouted and he should be at camp and training. She says maybe he doesn't want that and he wants to learn who he is.

47,1dnmo75,"AITA? Film premiere, but dad says no… ","AITA for wanting to go to a film premiere, despite my father explicitly telling me not to? 

Background: My mother passed away earlier this year unexpectedly from a heart attack. She worked in film as a location manager and so, following her death, as a family we were invited by the studio to attend the premiere. The trip would mean us having to go abroad and so, no one else wants to go. 

Today I told my family that I would want to go, as part of my grief process and also, as my mother’s condition is genetic, I want to make the most of the (possibly short) time I have left on this earth. My father told me that I couldn’t go and that he would be upset if I went. He said that he blames the stress of film on my mother’s passing and wouldn’t want to endorse a film that (he views) contributed to her sudden demise. 

I’m 30 and married and so would’ve thought I’d have agency over my life (despite having a very close relationship with my parents). 

It’s a tough situation as I don’t want to exacerbate my father’s grief but, at the same time, feel that this would be a major regret if I didn’t go; being unable to see the final film my mother worked on. I want to go, but not at the expense of my relationship with my father. Simply, I don’t want to be a jerk.

He is a great guy, but he will no longer make any effort at planning dinners.  Now the only time he will cook is if I plan a meal that requires grilling.  Then he will grill the meat but I still need to purchase it and have any side dishes handled.  I am very burned out from planning and cooking meals for my husband and myself.  I have to rush home and make dinner since our schedules are a little different and he wants dinner early and I just getting home at that time.  

I have told him he should make some meals, but he says I am too picky so he doesn't want to cook for me.

If he would just give me ideas I would be very happy to make them for him.  But he refuses for some reason.  Until last night....

Last night he told me that he wanted something this week.  I replied ""what?""  And he said he wanted me to make something for dinner this week.  So I replied again ""what?""  This happened again, almost the same thing from him saying he wants something but not saying what he wants.

A few days later I’m tasked with replacing some cleaning supplies and she asks me replace the container. I say no, the place I’m grabbing the supplies from doesn’t have it. Again, didn’t think much of it.


Yesterday, she asks again and I tell her straight up I’m not getting a new one. She broke it. She said she was the one that brought it, which is true, and that we all take turns replacing supplies. That is true. We all split cleaning supplies and things of that nature, but the container thing is not a rotating item. It’s only being replaced because SHE broke it.


Anyways, I tell her I’m moving soon anyways I don’t want to replace it thinking maybe she’d leave me alone but she then goes on about how that speaks to my character for not wanting to buy stuff for the apt. That is not true, I always grab what is asked for me to grab without questions asked. I just can’t stand this particular roommate and this was my one time I could say no justifiably. 


After like thirty minutes from that conversation she knocks on my door and says she has a compromise. I give her cash to replace and she’ll go get it since she’s already going to the store she had in mind. I give her cash cause I honestly just want her to leave me alone.


Anyways, she goes to the store and the one she has in mind is not in stock so she gets one that is nearly 4 times the cost and tells me to send her the rest.

56,1dnke6g,AITA for Parking in the Closest Spot,"I started working for a municiicipality that has multiple departments in smaller facilities that all share a larger parking lot a couple months  ago. Aside from the scattered handicapped spots in front of each facility and the Mayors spot the parking lot is open. The building my office is located in is shared with another small department so combined we have six employees on the far end of the parking lot, so plenty open space. 

Unknown to me everyone apparently has their ""preferred spots"", I just park in whatever is closest like I would anywhere else. OnToday however, I pull in and noticed the first spot closest to our building (opposite side of the median from the two handicapped spots) had a cone in the middle of the spot. The cone had been sitting in the median since I started here two months ago so I didn't think much of it. I noticed a guy from our facilities department and asked him if any work was being done in the parking lot today and he replied no. He mentioned that the baseball fields behind our buildings were busy this weekend so some kids likely put the cone there messing around. So I moved the cone and parked as usual. 

Then one of my staff starts getting text from the other department saying, ""we put that cone there to save that spot for our manager, and your manager just got out and moved it and parked there. That's her spot so can you ask him to not park there"". Then a few more text raging about how I had been parking there often since starting. Their manager isn't elderly, isn't obese nor does she show any signs of mobility issues so I told her to let them know that I said unless the spots are designated handicapped, or otherwise officially reserved then I will park wherever I choose and that I am happy to discuss the parking situation with their manager if she wishes.

Everytime we go to Stacias house Aalachia leaves in the middle of the visit most of the time without saying anything to anyone and either goes home or to either with some guy or to her boyfriends house and doesn't come back even if she says that she will

So last night Stacia asked us if we were hungry because she was about to make dinner and we both said yes. A few minutes after Stacia started cooking Aalachia got up and left and said that she was going to hang out with some guy. A little while after everyone finished eating she came back. She asked me if I saved her some food and I said no. She asked if I ate and I said yes

I thought there was more food left but turns out there wasn't. Stacias roommate came out and told Aalachia that she didn't have a plate saved because she left and nobody thought she was going to come back since she usually doesn't. And plus 5 people including a toddler had to eat. Aalachia looked annoyed but didn't say anything

A little while later we were in Stacias room talking to her until Aalachia got up and went into the kitchen and started pulling random stuff out of the refrigerator. I told her that it would be polite of her to ask if it's ok for her to eat any of that stuff. She started screaming at me saying that she was starving since she hadn't eaten all day and that she already asked Stacia and she said it was fine.

I know my grandparents are mad and I get it. But I feel like I need to put myself first. AITA?",0.0,0.01783636026084423,0,1
65,1dnjkdn,AITA for refusing to host the family BBQ for July 4th because I don’t want alcohol in my home?,"Hi there, recovering alcoholic here. Been sober 6 months and it’s been a struggle. Seeing a therapist and attending SMART recovery meetings. Not at all comfortable around alcohol, which has been a little isolating. Beer culture is huge here and every group, meetup, hobby, whatever, revolves around drinking. Making new friends who don’t drink is difficult. Sober events here are either “wellness” scams or group sports and I’m not into them.

One of my biggest drinking triggers is holidays, especially the ones that revolve around drinking. I have done my best to be there with my family but I tend to have to cut out early and do some self care after. 

I am a new homeowner and massively lucked out in getting a 4 bed/3 bath with a good sized patio and yard. Because of this, my family has pushed me to host. I have told them no every time. I am not comfortable with having alcohol at home and I know better than to try to tell adults not to drink for something like a drinking holiday. I don’t want all that drama, so I have simply declined. 

It has become an issue because now it’s going to be on my brother’s back to host the 4th. He has 2 kids with his wife and they’ve hosted before without issue. He just didn’t want to this time and wanted a chance to cut loose himself.

He and I got into an argument over it because he thinks I’m being selfish and making everyone else accountable for my drinking problem. That no one else is responsible for my drinking issues. I said of course they aren’t but I am trying to protect my peace by avoiding things I know will trigger me. He said that I was making excuses. That I’m a shitty sister and that he’s tired of dealing with my drinking problem. Which yes, there were a few times when I couldn’t go to events because I had been drinking and obviously couldn’t drive. None of them were important events, but I get why it annoyed him. 

I talked about this with my therapist, and she has said that it’s perfectly reasonable for me to want to avoid alcohol in my home. That I’m still fresh into sobriety and that it may be a few years before I’m truly comfortable in situations focused around drinking.

But I’m curious if Reddit thinks otherwise. AITA for this?

Today, I came from work and I found that they bought me two sofas and some stuff. And I was VERY mad. I just felt that my choices were disrespected and I told them that.

Hi so I Angel 16F have recently finished school and exams and started summer this school year has taken a toll on my mental health and physical as I suffered from anorexia and bulimia and I am currently still recovering.

I've had depression and anxiety for four years now I was diagnosed when I was 12 but my parents think mental health is just a joke and did not take me seriously until some things that happened last year.

Anyways recently I've been wanting to stay home constantly I'm mentally recovering from this past year and don't have the energy to really do anything. I've been staying in bed constantly the doctor said it's normal and for my parents to let me have space as I can be very irritated sometimes my parents refuse to follow that rule and just call me lazy and that I'm making up excuses.

Two days ago my mom wanted me to go do some paperwork for her as she can't speak English really well I told her I wasn't feeling well and if she could take my brother (15M) because I overheard her asking him. She started insisting that I go because I've been ""lazy"" and that I haven't been carrying my weight around the house.

I usually give in but this time I refused to go and she yelled at me and said ""you're not my daughter anymore never call me mom again. You're so lazy and never do chores you just stay in bed all day"" and a bunch of other stuff.

I snapped and called her out on her BS because my brother has never had to do anything anytime. If he refuses to do something she just lets him and moves on to ask me. He doesn't know how to do basic things like cook instant ramen and he's never washed dishes in his life cause ""he's a boy"".

My mom got pissed and she's been ignoring me for the past two days because she said I was being disrespectful by yelling back at her and I'm debating wether I should apologize or not.

For context we're immigrants and English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes.

68,1dnj1y8,AITA for letting my in-laws know that my baby was sleeping during their audible fight?,"I currently live with my in-laws with my infant son and husband. My in-laws find themselves in screaming matches daily. Yesterday, while my son was asleep I could hear them screaming from downstairs where we stay with the door shut. 

I have been told that I can let them know when the baby is sleeping. There was a break in their argument and so I said, “Just so you guys know, the baby is sleeping.” in a neutral tone and promptly exited the scene. 

Moments later I head my fil using my name and curse words together and something about “his f*cking house” to my mil. Then he came up to me 10 minutes later, heated, and said “Just so you know, I respect him (the baby) but I don’t think you get to shush me in my own home. This is my house.” I just looked at him and then he walked away. 

This morning I wanted to talk to him and asked my mil if I should about his responses towards me but my mil said “he has a point, it’s his house.” All I can think is, it sure is, but I don’t think I did or said anything wrong or to warrant that reaction. 

Seriously folks, aita? 

EDIT: INFO: We were self sufficient and had no threat to our self sufficiency (monetarily) before moving in. We had our first child and lived near no family. We were invited to live with them for help on multiple fronts. I was made aware that they have disagreements. All couples do, I was not made aware what they were like.

69,1dnizfe,AITA for not contacting my neighbor several times a week to tell him that his mail was misdelivered again?,"I have a question/scenario that is not especially high stakes but that has relevance regarding obligations to a relative stranger.

In 2023, my family moved to a suburban town outside a medium-sized city. Our new address is very similar to another house in the town. Imagine that we're living at 555 Chestnut Road, while a retired couple lives at 555 Chestnut Street. Several times a week, we receive mail for the couple living at the corresponding address. Our home's address is listed but with their names as the intended recipients. Apparently this is a longstanding problem, and the prior owner of our house used to contact the other couple every time something for them was in our mailbox. We received a note from the couple shortly after we moved in asking that we continue this system. This does not seem like an enormous request, but my wife and I work long hours and have a young son. We're already quite busy with the daily chores of our own existence, and it is at least moderately annoying to take responsibility for the mail of two people we've never met. Much of what we receive looks like junk mail that could be safely tossed, but I'm not sure that's legal or wise. We've tried penciling in the correct address and leaving it in our mailbox, but our carrier does not take it back.

My wife recently dropped off several months worth of mail in their mailbox. I received a text message later that day from the husband saying that we'd been receiving some of his wife's medical bills and they'd gone unpaid for long enough to be forwarded to a collections agency. I offered to put a sign on our box saying that ""Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so do not live here and all mail addressed to them should be delivered to 555 Chestnut Street."" I also said that I could leave all their mail in our box and he was totally welcome to check it whenever he liked. But I didn't agree to text or call him for every piece of mis-labelled mail even though he again asked that I do that. 

FWIW, I don't believe that a single piece of our mail has ever been accidentally addressed their house, which does make me wonder if they could be more careful when writing out their address on forms and documents. And, to be clear, we've all been relatively friendly in our communications.

And tho I have watched and listened to this with my gf so that I understand what they’re talking about, I still don’t know to much and struggle a little with keeping up the conversation. 

Anyways the other day I joined her friends on a wine night, and we started talking about some music and it came up the two of her friends (A guy and a girl) both like the same band as I do. Its a “local” band and I don’t know if anyone else who is into them as well. We found out there was a concert in a month and decided it would be fun to go. I asked Tara if she wanted to go as well and she said no, and that it was nice that I wanted to go with her friends.  

I mentioned this to my parents that I would be going without Tara and they thought it was weird. I was confused and my sister chimed in as well and said she would find it weird if her boyfriend hung out with her friends without her. Now I am a little scared that I might have asked Tara if it was okay at the wrong time, and that it wasn’t a place she was comfortable saying no in.

We’ve been really close friends pretty much since we started school last year and have had a pretty smooth roommate relationship so far with just a few hiccups here and there. I’ll also preface this by saying I’m pretty sensitive and have some issues with irrational anxiety and possible OCD. 

Anyway, my roommate has this Radiohead poster on the wall in our bedroom that has become the bane of my existence. It’s a poster with black-and-white mugshot style pictures of the five members’ faces staring directly into the camera. From the way it’s positioned on the wall, it always looks like they’re staring directly at you and into your soul, and it’s on the wall opposite from where my bed is so there’s really no escaping it. It’s always sort of creeped me out, but recently due to some circumstances in my life I’ve been feeling really stressed and paranoid and it’s become a lot worse to deal with. It always makes me feel like I’m being watched while I’m in my bedroom, and I know this sounds dumb but I hate getting naked in my room because the staring middle-aged men makes me feel self-conscious. On nights when my roommate isn’t there, I sometimes take a tapestry from my side of the room and hang it over the poster to cover it. I know this is all irrational but that hasn’t stopped it from becoming a huge problem.

So last night I finally sat my roommate down and admitted that the poster had been creeping me out because of my anxiety and asked if she would consider taking it down and maybe moving it to her other house back home. I even offered to pay for a new poster or decoration of her choice to put up in its place. To her credit she didn’t really get mad, she’s always been very supportive and patient with my anxieties, but she got kind of sad and insisted she likes it and didn’t want to take it down yet. She’s always had sort of eccentric tastes, but I try not to judge. 

I’ve just been feeling really guilty and controlling, and wondering if I’m an asshole for trying to dictate what she does in her own room. I’ve told my friends about it and have had mixed reactions, with some agreeing the poster is creepy and they wouldn’t want it in their room, while others think it’s not that bad and I’m being irrational.

My brain spoke without my filter activating and I was like ""oh yeah and when I get the plague next I'll use bacon lard."" She was really offended! Said she was just trying to help me and that antibiotics were poison. Hasn't spoken a word to me since.

My wife says I'm in the right (she actually thinks it's hilarious and laughed at my debacle for a good minute or two) but my dad (I ask him for a lot of work advice) says I should really keep my mouth shut on these things, and that being rude could come back to bite me in the butt. 

AITA? Should I have just swallowed what she said and never mentioned it again?

73,1dnhc33,AITA for Having my Mom take Our Puppy to His First Vet Visit.,"My GF and I got a new puppy three weeks ago. We needed to get shots at the Vet and I thought I would be able to get off work but it turns out I couldn’t. My GF also cannot get off work.

The Vet doesn’t have another opening for three more weeks. The dog needed shots in order to be exposed to other dogs and I didn’t want to make him wait. 

My mom is retired and lives 10 minutes away from the Vet and offered to take him. My GF insists “I am the Dad” and need to be there in person for his first appointment or reschedule it. 

AITA for just having my Mom take him and telling my GF I took him to avoid a fight?

74,1dnhadi,WIBTA if I didn’t attend my cousin’s visitation because I’m extremely confused and disgusted at my family’s actions,"First off, I (24M) want to say that I feel deeply terrible for my aunt who I’m pretty close to. I would go just for her, but I hate how my mom and others reacted to the news and I don’t want to be around them. 

My mom is a user. She’ll use any news as an excuse to get whatever she wants when she wants. The first thing she did after hearing the news was talk about all the wasted opportunity that he had with his inheritance. She cried and then started taking Xanax in order to go there, but that didn’t stop her from still talking about how much she hated her job, her life and just making shit about herself the whole time (to which no one listened, a fact which seems to always be there. No one pays attention to her at all). She didn’t really mourn much after that but she had an excuse to take off of work for the weekend and she gleefully took it. She works 2 days out of the week and spends the rest of it mean and miserable. She told my aunt that she’d be there the next morning to comfort and stay with her. She overslept.

All she and others did when it came to my cousin was complain about him the whole time whenever he needed help. They used to make fun of him for being mentally r******* even though he really wasn’t, maybe just came off a bit different from the blue collar vibe they usually have. But yet they all came out and acted like they cared so deeply for him and my aunt. I love my aunt to death, but I hate the deeply two faced and selfish nature that people on my mom’s side exhibit. I don’t get it at all. They aren’t warm, accepting, nice or anything and I honestly want to distance myself, but I don’t know how to do that with my aunt in the state that she’s in.

76,1dngs18,AITA for changing my mind about letting my gf name our son?,"My gf is currently pregnant with our first child, which we recently learned was a boy. Before we knew the gender we made a deal that if it was a girl, I would choose name and if it was a boy she would pick. That was before I realized that I hated every single name on her list. Especially the two that she was leaning toward the most, Elyan and Gawaine after the knights of the round table. One thing about her is that she has always been into fantasy and mythology, especially the Arthurian legends and she expressed that she has always loved both of these names.

Even though I didn't like her choices, I figure we didn't even know the gender yet so there was no point it bringing it up. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a boy (Not because I didn't want a boy, but because I didn't want to have this conversation).

I was hoping that she would change her mind and pick a better name, but no. She decided on Elyan, which I guess is better than Gawaine. But I still hate it. It sounds like a douchebag in a teen movie that they were trying way too hard to give a unique name.

I asked her if she had any normal names that we would both be happy with. She asked me what was wrong with the name she chose and I brought up the above mentioned concern. She got upset and told me that we had an agreement and she would have accepted any name I chose, even though she didn't like any of them either.

Now she'll barely talk to me. I've apologized for being so harsh about it, but I would at least like a say in the matter. I even mentioned another name that was on her list that I didn't hate as much (Leon) but she won't budge.

I honestly don't think it's unreasonable for me to want to have a say in my own sons name, but everyone I've talked to said that they actually really like the name an it's not fair for me to go back on our deal. So AITA?

Edit: Okay, yes making that deal was stupid and we shouldn't have done it in the first place. And yes, asking her to pick a ""normal name"" was a shit thing to say. I'm going to sit down and have an actual conversation with her about it and see if we can come to some kind of an agreement.

79,1dng8hg,AITA for snooping on son’s phone while catching him being disrespectful /bullying others ,"My teen son (16m) has had a smart phone for while. He and his friends are heavy users of social media- Snapchat, text, TikTok, etc.  My husband and I pay for his phone and monthly phone plan. My son is generally a good kid- straight As, has a job, helps around the house. But he is very influenced by his peers and definitely wants to be “cool”.  He sometimes leaves his phone unattended and here’s where I may be TA. He doesn’t know it but I will pick up his phone occasionally and read his messages, I admit I can be a snoop.

Recently I was horrified to see how he talks about girls and even to them. He curses at them, he and his friends rank the girls’ looks and he just acts like such a jerk - telling them they are ugly or to STFU. I didn’t raise him to be like that but I think he’s trying to impress his friends bc he’ll tell them what he’s said or happening as he is messaging the girls. This is relatively new as he wasn’t talking to girls a year ago.

I was so upset I confronted him and told him the way he uses his phone and social media is not appropriate and I pointed out some of the specific examples. Of course he asked how I knew and I told him I looked on this phone but that didn’t matter bc I paid for it. He told me everyone talks like that, it’s not a big deal, and he was really pissed and upset I went on his phone.

My husband and son think I ATA for snooping. I think it’s irrelevant because the behavior my son is exhibiting is awful and needs correcting. 

AITA?

EDITS:
reading through the comments, let me clarify a few things.
1. Husband: absolutely is appalled at our son’s behavior and he did tell him as much. I left that out as I was focusing more on the AITA aspect, the conflict. I may have assumed you all figured both parents were unhappy with what we found out. My husband is mad at our son but he’s also mad at me for my actions.
2. My son is actually pretty decent in real life. Opens doors for all people, makes friends easily, a mush for his pets, and all adults who meet him commend me for his manners. Has had girlfriends in the past- nothing serious, but I never saw him act in a concerning way. I think it’s the phone/social media aspect that unfortunately brings out the worst in him and his peers. 
3. We’ve had a few conversations today with my son trying to get him to understand how he sometimes texts is not appropriate but he is stubborn and keeps insisting all his friends- boys and girls- talk the same and are “just joking” and it’s not bullying bc everyone knows it’s not serious. I mean, from the snooping I saw I can confirm boys and girls teased him too, for recently getting dumped and that prompted his “well, you’re ugly” response to a girl. 
4. We have more work to do. Thank you everyone for chiming in. My husband and I are aligned his attitude has to change to grow into a more mature human being.

80,1dng3dt,AITA for not spending any time with a friend who came to visit me from abroad?,"**TDLR: My friend came to visit me abroad and I have no energy to entertain her because of work and life.**   
  
My friend Georgina (25F) came to visit me (29F) from our very far home country. Being a very good friend of mine, I told her that she absolutely shouldn't pay for accommodation and that she could just stay with me. Especially because the country I now live in is about 20x more expensive than our home country.   
  
I let her know that my room is small (literally 3 x 3m), but I'd be happy to let her have it and sleep on the blow-up mattress/couch. She said she wouldn't mind sharing a bed, as we have done before when travelling, but I know the spatial situation and told her that the room is claustrophobic. Also to note: I have four roommates, so it's more comfortable for them that I'm the person sleeping in the living area where people are cooking and doing laundry, both for Georgina's and my roommates' comfort. 

When she told me the dates of her vacation, I immediately flagged that this was the exact week I would be working on a major project deadline; i.e that I'd be working long hours everyday. We both agreed that I was giving her a place to stay but I had very little capacity to do anything else. She was also okay with doing her own thing. 

When she arrived, she asked if we could sleep in the same bed for ease. I was really tired from work and no longer cared what the living situation was, so I said that we could do whatever made her comfortable. You could tell that she was immediately taken aback by the size of the room (for two people), but then also started feeling bad and insisting she sleep on the couch. I reassured her she could have my room. 

This is where I came to regret things. I had never slept on the couch and after the first night, it was so uncomfortable that I was a zombie the next morning. Now, I was stuck in a complicated situation. I couldn't backpedal on her staying with me (nor do I want to), I couldn't put her on the tiny couch with my roommates walking around, and it would have uncomfortable to sleep in that little room together. 

I was so tired from no sleep and 12 hours of work that I couldn't hold a conversation. The second day I stopped by a local park just to sleep for 20mins. Despite our initial agreement, she kept asking me when I'd be free and I'd had to remind her that I'm working every day. I had these after-work 'dinner' hangouts twice and then I just couldn't do it anymore. I phoned my boyfriend (M38) in desperation and asked if I could just sleep by him for two nights to make the time pass and get some sleep ahead of my big project launch. 

I didn't let on how distraught I was and just told her that I hadn't seen my boyfriend in forever and wanted to spend time with him. I gave her the key to my place, told my roommates, bought her food, and essentially ran away. It's only been one night and I'm weighing up if I would be a bad person if I stayed away for two nights.

81,1dng2es,AITA for refusing to replace a picture I posted with an edited version of it?,"My father's girlfriend is very active on social media. She usually makes at least two Instagram posts a day. I'm fairly certain she's trying to become an influencer.

While I don't care much for that, one thing I've noticed is that almost every picture she posts is photoshopped in some way. Sometimes she makes her waistline smaller, other times she airbrushes her face. Sometimes, she does both. I don't know how noticeable it is to other people, but both me and my husband can always tell.

My birthday was this weekend. I had a baby a few months ago and I haven't had time to do much. So last week, my friends and family threw me a surprise party to celebrate both my birthday and my first year of being a mom. I later made a post on Instagram thanking everyone, in which I included several pictures from the party.

A few hours later, my father called me to ask if I could add a picture that featured his girlfriend to the post I'd made. I was frustrated, but deleted it and reposted it with a picture of me, my husband, our baby, my father and his girlfriend. It was the only one I had of her at the party.

Hours after that, his girlfriend sent me a photoshopped version of the picture and asked if I could replace the one I'd posted. She had changed her waistline, retouched everyone's faces and whitened our teeth.

I said no. While she's free to post whatever she wants on her socials, I don't want an obviously photoshopped picture on mine.

She argued the picture I'd posted would clash with the ones on her page, and she didn't want her followers to see her like that. I reminded her that my account is private, and the only people who will see my post are friends and family who already know what she looks like. When she kept insisting, I told her that either she accepted the unedited picture or I'd remove it from the post entirely.

My father wants me to humor her. He says it would take little to no effort on my part to replace the picture. I'm aware of that, I just don't want to do it. I didn't even want to include the picture in the first place, I only did it because they wanted me to.

I'm busy this week, and dealing with this has become very annoying.

Momma dog started showing signs of going into labor early Friday morning. I was supposed to be a bridesmaid so I told my sister I'd be late to the pre-wedding events  on Friday like decorating the reception hall and lunch until I could find someone to come stay with Momma. I called the other fosters in the area and our organization heads but no one could come until Saturday night. She started delivering puppies late Friday night and was still going Saturday morning (she wound up having 11).

I called Robin to tell her I was sorry but wouldn't be able to attend because I had to stay with Momma. I assumed she would understand since she loves animals but she didn't. Robin told me to find someone else and I informed her there wasn't anyone else until that evening. She said that was too late, and then said I should show up just for the ceremony and she and I could do pics at a later date. I told her I couldn't. Robin suggested I attend via video and again I explained I really can't participate in any capacity because I need to take care of Momma not to mention that's probably not a sight or sounds anyone wants during a wedding and reception. 

I sent her a text late Saturday night to let her know Momma did fine. I figured that might help because again, she usually loves animals. Instead all I got was a text yesterday saying 'This is why you hardly get invited to places. You've had seven pregnant dogs already but this was my only wedding. Talk to me when you want to be a sister.'

Robin's not talking to me and I've noticed others in our family like our dad aren't talking to me either.

83,1dneyt1,AITA for stopping sending gifts to my family for birthdays and holidays? ,"AITA for stopping sending my family birthday and holiday gifts? 

I recently sent a lengthy explanation email to my entire immediate family that we will not be sending gifts for birthdays and Christmas, or any other holidays/occasions going forward. Instead, we would rather spend time making memories and use the previous gift budget to afford travel (we live out of state) to visit family a few times a year. 

I also explained that I’m not keeping score, but we are a family of 3 (1 child only), and both of my sisters are married with 3+ children that require gifts throughout the year. My sisters (2) do not have a relationship therefore they do not give gifts to each other’s families while I’m sending gifts to both. 

I received some positive and neutral responses to this email, but one individual was rather peeved. 

One sister says I ATA because she feels by not sending her AND her children gifts is an easy way out for us to not recognize them on their special days throughout the year. She goes on to say that even if we do travel to see them we should still have gifts for them to open to make them feel thought of. 

I understand how this is frustrating, but they’re under 6 and won’t remember a crappy toy from a store in 2 years anyways. Plus, she has one child to buy for in my family while I have 3 for hers. 

In total for birthdays, Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, life events and special occasions  we were sending an avg 47 gifts a year just to my immediate family. My husband’s family is triple the size of mine and is not included in this. 

Here’s the breakdown of average costs:
Frugal budget of $20 per person per gift
Realistic budget of $50-$75 per person per gift ($62.50 to be fair)

Frugal budget: $940
Realistic Budget: $2,937.50

84,1dneh0u,AITA for telling parents their opinion doesn’t matter? ,"I am in my 20s, and my parents assisted me in purchasing an apartment. I have a neighbor, “Lisa”. Lisa is in her 70s and is insufferable. She screams “shut up” to herself when there is no noise, and over the past few years has complained: I shut my door too loudly, I shut my cabinets too loudly, I move my chairs too loudly. I’m extremely quiet, and I’m a student. I’m rarely home, and rarely have guests. 

My parents thought it was a good idea to appease Lisa. They bought rugs so my apartment was quieter, and chair pads so they wouldn’t make noise when they move. Lisa complained about the last owner as well. Management generally ignores Lisa but it’s still annoying. My parents try talking to Lisa a lot to calm her down.  

My bf is staying with me a lot and has a dog. The dog is sweet, but large. Lisa has been submitting complaints about dog to management, both real and fake (real- sometimes when we leave for an hour or so he gets lonely, fake in that sometimes she complains he barks “for hours” when my bf is home all day and it’s just not true). The building is full of dogs that bark and ours is exceptionally well behaved. He’s also a service animal so her arguments are worthless. 

My parents called me to complain. Apparently Lisa said the dog is not allowed (false), said he was annoying, said she would have to “do something” about it. My parents said we leave the dog alone too much (2 hours max once a week. My bf works from home so dog is never by himself).

I said their opinions on parenting my bf’s dog dont matter (they have no experience with dogs for at least 30+ years). This made them irate, but I’m not sure why. They kept threatening me that the dog wouldn’t be allowed, said he would bite someone (then called me a “fucking idiot” when I said he never bites), then got mad and asked why I couldn’t “appease” Lisa. I told them their attempts to appease Lisa failed miserably. They called me a “disrespectful bitch” and that Lisa was rallying other people against dog (Lisa is the only person to complain about the dog). My mom begged me to be respectful, I said no. 

I told my parents to stop giving Lisa info (false promises about when dog would leave), they got upset. I told them to not call me about anything Lisa-related again. 

Then my mom criticized me for not being “nice” to my neighbor, Rob. Rob is 60 and invited me to church a few times, I declined. I’m an atheist and have no interest in hanging out with Rob. My parents invited Rob to dinner for some reason. My mom called me a “bitch” for not being friendlier to Rob and said I alienate everyone. I asked her why tf she was yelling at me, and that she can talk to Rob herself if she wants to so badly.

88,1dndh3x,WIBTA for uninviting my friend to my wedding? ,"I've known my friend V since childhood, and he has been in a relationship with his boyfriend H for over six years. They moved in together after a year, but their relationship hasn't been great. My boyfriend and I are getting married this summer, and invited both V and his boyfriend to our wedding.

Four years ago, V started having an affair with a second boyfriend, P. When P found out about H, he broke up with V, thankfully he dodging the bullet. V told our mutual friends and me that he was going to break up with H but never did. Initially, we thought he was just unhappy and lacked the courage to end things with H.

A few months later, V seemed to have moved on and was trying to work things out with H. However, he soon told us he started dating a new person, M, without H’s knowledge. Once again, he claimed he would break up with H but never followed through.

V began bringing M to our friend group meetups more than his actual boyfriend H, and he even asked us to lie about H no longer living with him. He expects us to maintain this deceit. M also became a colleague of V and my boyfriend, who work at the same company. IMPORTANT: my friends and I confronted V about his behavior, telling him it is wrong, but he keeps making excuses, saying he can not break up with H because H is going through a tough time. This situation has persisted for three years now. Both H and M believe they are in serious, exclusive relationships with V. V keeps telling us he isn't with H, but H is clearly unaware of this and still living with him.

We’ve repeatedly talked to V, calling him out on his behavior. I have also been asking him who he will be bringing to our wedding for months now, we invited H, because he is our friend, and we still consider him being V's boyfriend.

They moved in together after a year, but their relationship hasn't been great. My boyfriend and I are getting married this summer, and invited both V and his boyfriend to our wedding.

Four years ago, V started having an affair with a second boyfriend, P. When P found out about H, he broke up with V, thankfully he dodging the bullet. V told our mutual friends and me that he was going to break up with H but never did. Initially, we thought he was just unhappy and lacked the courage to end things with H.

A few months later, V seemed to have moved on and was trying to work things out with H. However, he soon told us he started dating a new person, M, without H’s knowledge. Once again, he claimed he would break up with H but never followed through.

V began bringing M to our friend group meetups more than his actual boyfriend H, and he even asked us to lie about H no longer living with him. He expects us to maintain this deceit. M also became a colleague of V and my boyfriend, who work at the same company. IMPORTANT: my friends and I confronted V about his behavior, telling him it is wrong, but he keeps making excuses, saying he can not break up with H because H is going through a tough time. This situation has persisted for three years now. Both H and M believe they are in serious, exclusive relationships with V. V keeps telling us he isn't with H, but H is clearly unaware of this and still living with him.

We’ve repeatedly talked to V, calling him out on his behavior. I have also been asking him who he will be bringing to our wedding for months now, we invited H, because he is our friend, and we still consider him being V's boyfriend. M is a colleague of my boyfriend, and also knows we are getting married. V keeps saying he will be making a choice soon, and even jokes about bringing them both, or we should do the wedding twice. However, he doesn’t make up his mind and continues this deceitful situation. I’m fed up with V’s behavior in general and feel like I should uninvite him to our wedding.

I want to give a brief preface. My sister and I have grown up in an abusive household. She's had mental issues since young adulthood years, and a primary one she'd communicate is depression. I was able to move out of the house first due to securing a good position after high school. My sister was working part time at a position for a while and had trouble for years finding a job to sustain living away from our parents. So I let her stay wherever I'd go, and we split the rent and utilities halfsies.

The experience the entire half decade plus living with my sister has been fine. But one constant issue that's come up quite a bit is she's a slob. She leaves her stuff everywhere, treats any clean public surface as cluttered storage for her stuff. I have a bench I bought for the foyer to put our shoes under and also sit on when we put our shoes on for the day. She just has it littered with random Amazon packages that she has either opened or hasn't for months, random mail, etc.

For other instances, whenever I'd bring up her messiness, it'd always turn into an argument. She'd use her depression as a scape goat, and try to say I'm just as messy because I have one empty water bottle on the nightstand in the living room. But she ignores all her dishes, gadgets, and clutter taking up near every square foot of counters pace in the kitchen, the dishes she's kept in her side of the sink for a month, etc.

This time it’s almost a 2h drive so after some debate we compromised on me renting a place nearby and staying there while he’s at the bbq.

My partner says I dismissed what they felt & just wanted to control what they did. I feel like this is what accountability looks like and if they wasn't going to prioritize their health, I had to.

97,1dnchbf,AITA for smoking weed with my little brother ,"im 20M and my brother is now 15M.
Back when i was 14, we lost our dad to cancer, me and my bro were so close with my dad, and the family completely fell apart after. We pretty much stopped interacting with each other and became like roommates.

My brother took the loss very badly, and he started acting out, he was rude to my mum, would get in trouble in school and even at times with the police.

When i left for university the first time, my mum called me crying saying that she couldn't take it and that he was getting too much to handle and she wanted to move the family back home to her parents house in India (We are all indian but grew up in the UK).

I went home for easter break and i found out that my brother was smoking weed, he was 14 at the time. I was so angry with him at first but then we had a big fight about it and he said it makes him feel better and it makes his life less shit. That night we sparked one up together and we talked as if we were college buddes who hadnt seen each other in 10 years.

Since that night we've smoked together regularly and our relationship has completely 180°d. I started calling him and texting him every day when i was in uni, reminding him to behave and not give mum any trouble. His behaviour has improved so much.

Now its summer and im home for 3 months so we have just been smoking loads. Obviously smoking is bad for your health and it makes me guilty, but the same time, with me he's safe, teenagers are gonna get high regardless, i would rather he does it with me so i can look after him in case anything ever goes bad. 

My brother seems completely different when he is high, both of us suffer from severe  ADHD, and while my dad was so anti medication that I was forced to deal with it myself, my mum has seen a psychiatrist and got him a prescription.

But he hates it, he says it makes him become a robot, and ive seen it before, he says weed helps him loosen up and feel more normal. He has improved his behaviour alot since we've become close  , i gave him advice on which friends are worth keeping, and he has really sorted himself out. I am really glad that things are going well for us now, he is behaving better, my mum is happier.

But i feel guilty that i encourage him to do this ""bad habit"" as my mum calls it. I know smoking weed technically isnt like as bad as cigarettes but smoking anything is still harmful. ",Asshole,2024-06-24,"AITA for smoking weed with my little brother  im 20M and my brother is now 15M.

99,1dnbrae,AITAH for not telling my brother about my history with his ex-wife?,"So I (28M) joined the army straight out of high school with my brother (28M). We went through training and being stationed at the same base, so always together. That is, until my first deployment. If you’ve never been on a deployment, it’s fairly easy to lose contact with absolutely everyone while out there. And I had unfortunately lacked in the communication department for the entire tour. 

Given the situation, appearently my brother had started talking to a former friend (27F) of his from high school and they just hit it off. This friend however, had been one of my close friends for years… and as young adults are known to do, we had a pretty… close… history. She had moved out to where we were and was there when I got home, and if you know any military people, you might know that relationships are notoriously often rushed. 

So they had waited till I got back to let me know they had gone to a courthouse and got married. I honestly was so surprised and overwhelmed with post deployment activities that I just didn’t tell him about our history. I really don’t know if he knew or if she had told him, so I just left it as it was.  So AITAH for not letting him know I had hooked up with his wife? 

At this point in life, they only lasted about 3-4 years and she is no longer around, but I think about it every now and again.

104,1dnap0p,AITA for not stopping for a bird?,"So the other day me and my wife was driving down a larger road at about 100kn/h when a large bird hit the top of my windshield, I think it was a crow or a magpie. I kept on driving but my wife said that we had to stop to see if the bird was ok, I told her that it was probably dead since I hit it at 100km/h and birds usually break their neck when they fly into a regular window. My wife then yelled at me that we had to stop the car and go check on it. 


I told her that that once again we are driving 100km/h that means that the bird is at least 2km behind us and will be even further away when I find a place to pull over. What then?

Also there are cars behind us so if that bird survived one of the other cars probably got it as well. 

My wife told me ""what if you hit a deer?! Would you stop then?!"" (We have a lot of deer here) I told her that of course I would stop if I hit a damn deer cause that is the law and a deer would hopefully be much easier to find than a crow.

She dropped it after that but the rest of the ride was a bit cold.

105,1dnaj5c,AITA for telling my friend another friend is excluding them on purpose?,"It all started when my friend Allen (19M) started excluding another friend Silas (19M) from any meetups because he got mad that he regularly hung out with another group that had (bad) history with us, sometimes conflicting with our schedule to meet up. He felt that Silas was always taking from him and never giving anything back mainly because Allen had to drive him around every hangout as Silas didn't have his license, and he thought Silas looked fatter every year and stank. This was discussed on call with both me, Allen, and another friend Cameron (19M) and I also made one complaint that he isn't concise with his words. I decided not to tell Silas and let Allen tell it to him himself to avoid making Allen and Silas unhappy.

Fast forward a couple of days and Allen and I were in an argument about something stupid and one of my other friends Alex (19M) was glazing him on a group chat call. I got angry because it felt like they always took sides against me and found pleasure in antagonizing me. For example, the majority of banter they do is about me, mostly with weird sexual jokes. While probably petty, my reasoning for my next action, which was to tell Silas that Allen was excluding him from all our hangouts on purpose, was that if Allen didn't care whether or not I got angry, I might as well not care either and at least do some good and help Silas know and understand that Allen was ghosting him if Allen would not.

When I texted in the group chat letting Silas know why Allen always seemed to be busy, Allen left the call and threatened to leave the group if I didn't give him ownership of the group (idk why). I gave Alex ownership of the group instead as a compromise to make sure I didn't abuse my power. The way the argument transpired after Allen decided to talk with Alex alone and me with Silas to explain Allen's grievances (I made sure to also tell him what I said behind his back) was all of Allen's previous complaints, except the fatness and stink and Silas arguing that he did help Allen with stuff sometimes.

Then, the argument turned on me as Allen was angry that I brought it up to Silas and my argument was that friendships required transparency, which Allen disagreed with and said that he had a bigger friend circle than me which are people part of another group (not related to Silas's), which Cameron and I had (bad) history with and that he regularly hung out with, so he would know better and that I am only doing this argument to ""get back at him"" and it was ""about me"" the entire time because I was ""losing"" the previous argument. All of my other friends stayed neutral when I was arguing with him even though they agreed that they didn't have a problem with Silas and that Allen was not in a ""stable"" mindset right now when Allen wasn't on the call.

The argument ended when Allen started making jokes, and all my other friends followed suit and everyone left the call.",2.0,1.0464168787002563,1,0
106,1dnaf7l,AITA for refusing to bring my letter from my mom to family therapy?,"My parents broke up when I (16m) was a few weeks old. They were never married and they were like 19/20 when they had me, so pretty young. They didn't get along so good but they could be sorta civil to each other. It really depends on what was going on I think because sometimes they stayed away from each other. When I was 6 my dad met my stepmother and they got married by the time I was 7. My mom and stepmother did not get along at all. I remember feeling the tension between them. I remember hearing my stepmother grumble to dad about mom if I had to go to their house instead of home with mom after they had all been in the same place. It was extra bad if they all showed up to my dance recitals. My stepmother wanted to be the one doing some of the dance stuff. She used to tell my dad she didn't think she'd have much in common with a young boy but dance could be our thing and mom was hogging it by always being there. Mom was the person who signed me up for dance. Dad wasn't on board back that. He's a bit too macho dude for that.

My mom got sick when I was 8 and she died when I was 10. The worst part of that time was when she got too sick to take care of me and I had to live with my dad all the time. I still saw my mom. But it wasn't the same. Before she died she wrote me a letter and told me to read it whenever I needed to feel close to her. She said she put all her love into that latter. She also left me cards for milestones.

My mom's original letter made my stepmother so angry though. I never called my stepmother 'mom' or anything. I never call her my parent either. I know she technically is. But I always disliked the idea of her being called that because she hated mom so much and felt like mom needed to step back from stuff to let her take over them (like dance). My stepmother is pissed that my mom never mentioned her in the letter and that mom never asked me to let her (stepmother) in. She felt like mom put up a final wall between us and made sure she would always be the outsider in my eyes and I would always long for my mom and reject her as a mother figure. Our relationship is really tense while things with my dad are better than they were when I was younger. He got softer. So he said the three of us should go to therapy together to figure stuff out.

After two months of therapy my stepmother wants the letter brought into sessions and the counselor feels like that's a good idea and we should discuss the content of it since it's such a point of tension. But I don't want my stepmother anywhere near it. She's poison when it comes to my mom and I don't want her to taint it. The counselor told me it would only benefit us all. My stepmother got mad and said even a piece of paper is more important to me than she is. We had two sessions since and I did not bring it. This made my stepmother's anger worse.

109,1dn9tg2,AITA along with my wife for telling my sister how we feel?,"**TL;DR**

My sister married an undocumented immigrant after 8 months of dating and asked me to be a witness at the courthouse. I politely declined, and now both my wife and I are on her bad side.

**TL;DR**

My sister asked my wife to be a bridesmaid, and my wife agreed. However, my sister planned bridesmaid activities without including her. My wife then backed out, and my sister didn't seem to care.



My sister has been dating someone for about 8 months. I've only met him a few times, and he seems nice. He came to the US on a student visa that expired over two years ago, and since then, he hasn't worked on his immigration status. In December, they came over to announce their marriage. My sister said, ""We are getting married so we can get loans together, a house, and so he can get social security,"" without mentioning love or anything similar. I was shocked but happy for her, but she made no mention of involving me in the process.

My sister is much closer with our other sibling and his wife and didn't show me the same respect. She spoke to them first without her partner (they're always together) and didn't give me the chance to ask important questions. A couple of weeks later, she texted me, asking me to be a witness, which I see as essentially vouching for someone. I declined, and only after that did my other sibling talk to her about it and suggest at least getting a prenup to be safe.

Things settled down after a week or two, and my sister asked my wife to be a bridesmaid. My wife agreed. A couple of weeks ago, my sister went dress shopping with 3-4 other bridesmaids (including our brother’s wife) without inviting my wife, even though we live just 20 minutes away. My wife felt hurt and sat on it for days, wondering why she wasn’t invited. My sister said it was last minute and not all bridesmaids were there. My sister would NEVER do that to her other sister-in-law. My wife, who has been married to me for 14 years and is the mother of my child, expressed how she felt, but my sister's response echoed our brother's wife (they are closer).",Not the A-hole,2024-06-24,"AITA along with my wife for telling my sister how we feel? **TL;DR**

110,1dn9nsv,AITA for ignoring my ex with BPD,"For context, I (21F) started dating this guy (25M) about a year ago. We have been on and off for issues related to his BPD such as:
• He would make a huge deal out of me not spending time with him on video games or watching movies (even if I explained that I was busy)
• He accuses me of talking to other guys constantly even though I took it upon myself to delete all guy friends or any exes (just out of respect). There were no other guys in my life aside from his friends as commanded I wasn't allowed to make new guy friends. 
• He would regularly invade my privacy, as well as go through my phone without asking, and get mad if I did not give him my phone.(I get *why* some people need to check phones but he makes me show him private messages between other friends, etc)
• He would threaten to post my intimate photos, share personal things about me to my own family or just ""air out"" my business to random people.
• He admitted to gaslighting and manipulating me, upon several instances. All of which he would take back later and say ""it was a joke""
• He constantly yelled at me for miniscule things like 'not listening to him' while we were on a video game together, or if he asked me a personal question and I responded truthfully (about past partners), he would begin to yell and lash out toward me. Sometimes even calling me names such as slvt, whvre, bvtch and rvtard. 

Because of those reasons and many more, we have broken up multiple times and he would say that he is going to get therapy (which did not happen) and promise to get better (did not happen), with our most recent breakup being last month.
I have told him that I do not want to be with him anymore and that if he wanted to be in my life, we could only be ""friends"". I immediately regret that decision as he has gotten more verbally aggressive since placing that boundary. Tonight was the last straw as he became emotionally abusive because I did not want to play a video game with him.

I took it upon myself to stand my ground and did not get on the game as I told him, ""friends"" would not force something like this to one another. This made him very triggered and he ended up spamming my phone/discord simply because I did not want to respond to his threats. His final message was him saying he is going to disappear off grid

I have contacted his brother and told him to check on him.
I have also told him personally to seek help at a hospital, or talk to a friend about how he is feeling.

They got married 4(?) years ago and they started dating 6 years ago. I was actually living in another country at the time studying overseas. I only came back home briefly for the wedding and only came back officially last year. So I haven't spent much time with my mom's husband. But being truthful, even if I had, given the age I was when they got together, I wouldn't see him as my dad/parent.

Which is why he stunned me by telling me he wanted to ""give me away"" at my wedding. He told me he looked forward to doing it for all three of his girls (he has two daughters and a son so I guess he counted me) and was excited at the thought of me being the first he gives away. I didn't like the way he worded it (giving me away) or the fact he approached me about this when he had no hand in raising me. But my mom loves him so I was kind, said it was a sweet offer, lovely gesture, but I wasn't very comfortable with that and we could figure out something else for him to do if he wanted to be more involved in the wedding.

This was met with him questioning why I'd say no and him saying he thought I would be happier to have him do it. He said given I have no father in my life and grew up with no close adult males, it made sense. I pointed out to him that I had my mom who raised and sacrificed for me. He was like yeah, but she's no man and I told him I didn't plan to have a very traditional wedding so mom doing it wouldn't be strange at all. He genuinely never considered the fact I would ask mom and he became very emotional when I brought this up. It was a mixture of embarrassment, sadness and frustration and he was word vomiting all over the place. It got on my nerves because he was clearly not okay with me saying no to him. He told me he should have been my first choice and it made no sense that he wasn't when he's the only father figure I have.

112,1dn9egq,AITA for using dead parents to win an argument?,"Ok, so I 21M, have an older brother, Omar, 26M, who has a 2 year old son, and another child on the way. Our parents were originally from Pakistan, but moved to the UK long before we were born. They taught us Urdu at home and we flew back to Pakistan often in our childhood. When I was 16, they died. 

Omar ended up marrying his wife Lily, who is monolingual and more than a little embarrassed about it, since most people in our family and even her friends speak at least 2.  So she decided she did not want her kids to learn Urdu, since she couldn't and she didn't want to feel like more of an outsider. If you don't know, Urdu can be a pretty difficult language to learn in adulthood, so she can't speak it.

Omar was upset about this but eventually agreed. I've been talking to him recently and he said that while he does really want his children to learn, he just can't bring himself to fight with Lily. We got into a bit of an argument, if he didn't start as kids, then his children wouldn't be able to learn it in adulthood, and would probably even have difficulty as teenagers.

Ok, so I 21M, have an older brother, Omar, 26M, who has a 2 year old son, and another child on the way. Our parents were originally from Pakistan, but moved to the UK long before we were born. They taught us Urdu at home and we flew back to Pakistan often in our childhood. When I was 16, they died. 

Omar ended up marrying his wife Lily, who is monolingual and more than a little embarrassed about it, since most people in our family and even her friends speak at least 2.  So she decided she did not want her kids to learn Urdu, since she couldn't and she didn't want to feel like more of an outsider. If you don't know, Urdu can be a pretty difficult language to learn in adulthood, so she can't speak it.

Omar was upset about this but eventually agreed. I've been talking to him recently and he said that while he does really want his children to learn, he just can't bring himself to fight with Lily. We got into a bit of an argument, if he didn't start as kids, then his children wouldn't be able to learn it in adulthood, and would probably even have difficulty as teenagers.

113,1dn8wfr,WIBTA if I [34/F] asked my friend [34/F] to uninvited my father [72/M] from her grandmother's [91/F] funeral?,"My friend and I have been friends since we were 5. Her grandmother lived with her and her mum, and because her mum often worked very long hours, her grandmother would look after us. I knew her very well and I am very fond of her, as she was of me.

My father wasn't involved in my social life growing up. We have been estranged for five years because of the way he has treated me which I'd prefer not to detail in this post.

He and my friend's mother got to know each other because they had offices next door to each other. For a few years, they had lunch together, etc. My father didn't know her grandmother.

In December last year, I saw my friend after a period of not speaking much. She made a bunch of rude innuendos that made it clear my father had spoken about my mental health in a derogatory way to her mother. I don't have the mental illnesses he says I do (BPD, NPD). He also shared some very personal information about me with her mother.

I confronted my friend and asked what my dad had said and when. She denied that my father had said anything, but it was very clear that he had. She called me crazy for accusing her of this. I tried to explained that my father gets up to this nonsense regularly. I haven't explained the full extent of the abuse because I am ashamed.

Then, I heard from her about her grandmother's death. I responded and expressed my condolences. She sent me this:

""Relationships and friendships are so important. Especially for someone like me who has so few people to turn to. Hope you and I can move on from the past and can spend some time together soon. You know that I love you dearly and our estrangement has been particularly painful. Do find it in your heart to forgive me if I have trespassed in any way"".

She then invited me to the funeral:

""I would love for you to be with me at the funeral to prove how you are my sister and always have been an integral part of our family. As you know, you were much loved by my grandma.""

I want to go to the funeral. Even though I'm a bit angry about what happened, I realise that it was fuelled by a lot of her personal issues - she has been the sole caregiver for her grandmother while her mother works for the last few years, and she is very socially isolated and needs a friend. I need to put my own grievances aside and be there for her because I really don't want to cause her any pain when she is already grieving.

But - her mother has invited my father. She only invited him because he called after I told my mum that her grandmother had died. He is of course going to the funeral. It's not so much about putting my friend first, but the fact that I am scared of my father. I have PTSD. It will be a small funeral - roughly 15 people, and I really don't want to see him, but I also want to be there for my friend.

She calls herself super mother and she always tells me how good she has been for me. I see it differently. 

I left my kids dad (29M) 2,5years ago.  We have two kids (3M,4F). It was hard for me to start over and everyone told me they will help me as much as they can. So nice words but what was the reality? Me handling everything all by myself, surviving from every day being hungry because i didnt have money to buy food for myself, i saved every money to buy food for my children. Same time trying to get over the breakup and some other issues like working on the trauma my ex caused me. No one caring most of the time how am i doing. Me spending weeks inside home alone with kids cos i was depressed but no one cared enough to even talk with me. At some point i was reaching out for them but my mom said its just too big of a burden to babysit two kids, i asked few times if she could take them for  few hours so i could sleep. Then same time she would tell everyone how good grandmom she is and how she helps me so much, and was wondering why i dont go out with friends at night. Like how could i if you cant help me😂 Everything that happened to me, from childhood till now, i figured it out by myself cos no one seemed to care. She talked so mixed things at some point i just stop asking. My whole life i felt somewhat unwanted and like they didnt love me, even as kid i remember feeling like outsider.

Now. My younger sister (f20) has her own issues and has caused so much drama just for her entertainment. She purely does it cos it gives her satisfaction to see others cry and worry.

117,1dn82zh,AITA: Asked neighbor to have her adult son turn his house music down at midnight…She slammed the door in our faces.,"For context: Our neighbor is an older woman who lives alone. Her son (mid 40s) lived with her for a while, moved out to his older sister’s place but frequently comes over and spends the night at his mother’s. His bedroom window is directly across from mine, and he loves house music. Which is dope, because so do I! However, he has a habit of blasting his music during the late night hours - typically between 11:00pm and 1:00am. 

So cut to tonight - it’s 11:00pm and he starts up the house music. I’ve got my window open because its mid-summer and it gets sickeningly hot here at night. He’s got his window open too, so the music is blaring directly into my room. Fortunately, he’s got a good taste in the stuff, but unfortunately, I wake up at 6:00am for work. So we let it rock until midnight, and sure enough, he’s still going hard. I’m talking fifteen minute-long Seven Nation Army remix hard. It ends up getting louder, at which point we decide to go next door to request he either turn it down a smidge OR close his window. Mind you, we had no intent of asking him to shut it OFF - just turning it down or closing the window so that every lyric and/or instrument isn’t audible in my room.

So we go next door, knock, and his mom answers. At first she doesn’t even open the door, she just looks at us through the side window and goes “What?!”. So we calmly, politely request that she have her son turn the music down or even just shut his window as we are trying to sleep in preparation for the Monday work day. She then opens the door, and before we can explain any further, SHOUTS, “He’s hardly here so it’s not like it’s happening all the time! So please don’t complain!”. I try to explain we aren’t there to rag on them, but before I can finish, she says, “Well that’s just TOO bad!”, then proceeds to slam the door in our faces. 

We go back to the house - and I’m honestly flabbergasted. We usually get along fine with them both. I was just in the yard chatting with her for an hour about our local mourning dove population not even a month ago. I used to bring her son fruit from our yard when the season was on, etc. Everything was normal. So where this hostility came from… I have no idea. So what gives - am I the asshole?

Mum said that I can't risk landing on my neck at an odd angle, and told a story about how my dad (36M) landed on his neck and broke it after doing a backflip onto a mattress. She told me I need to be sensible and assess the risks, which I agree with.

I replied with, ""You have to assess the risks, and then take safety precautions and avoid anything that would put you in a situation where the risk is high."" She then told me to stop being a selfish little brat (which came out of nowhere from my perspective) and that ""it isn't about my instant fun.""

I have a few arguments which I would have used, but she walked away and swore at me. These were my reasons:

* Any sport is a perfect example of my reasoning. Take rock climbing, for example. You make sure that where you are climbing is safe first, and then you get safety equipment and do double checks, and when something is about to go wrong, (like a loose rock), you stop and deal with the situation.
* Every decision you make involves an amount of risk.

I understand that it has risk, but I'm willing to take the risk to learn and experience. If something goes wrong, then I've learnt not to do it.

Afterwards, while I was typing this post, she walks into my room and and asks what I'm doing. I tell her, ""I'm typing out something so I don't get angry at you directly."" She then goes off on a spiel about how she ""was just telling you to be safe,"" and ""I know Mum's opinion isn't popular at your age, but it's the truth.""

119,1dn7o3o,AITA for my friend choosing to ghost me?,"Edit: made it more well-written and structured to make the situation easier to understand

Context: this friend and I live close to each other and go to the same university, so we hung out a lot and even carpooled to get to campus plenty of times. I communicated once that she really abused my boundaries by disrespecting my privacy once, to which she said ""I don't want to talk about this right now,"" then gave me the silent treatment. If you can tell by now, she's a terrible communicator in general, which I always thought was alright because everyone is different. 

The current situation: From my point of view, we hung out a lot during finals before summer break, then when we got home, biked together. Soon, I learn that her dad and her had a huge argument which strained their relationship or something, so I asked her if she was alright. No response. I try a couple days later, and still nothing. She's mostly gone dark and not messaging anyone so our friend group is obviously all worried for her, me included. 

Then, a month later she comes back and starts messaging in group chats. But she only interacts with me once after that, then never again. She starts ghosting me privately and avoiding me in all group settings, so I'm wondering what the hell is going on. So I message her again, asking if there's some way I might've offended her somehow and ask to talk about it, still no response. 

Eventually, she posts a status update on Instagram, saying ""you constantly defended my dad, and now u want me to open up?"" which was clearly directed to me. I can think of one time I ""agreed"" with her dad, which was when we talked about Computer Engineering being a more versatile major than Biomedical Engineering. 

She talks to people around me that we know, including my parents, but goes out of her way to avoid me still, which hurts. We recently went to a family picnic and she brought a friend to avoid talking to me (she usually never brings anyone), and even took some of our friends over over with her and did everything to avoid having to interact, but still glanced over occasionally to watch what I was doing. I gave her the space she wanted and chose to not interact with her either. 

I guess she could've misunderstood somehow that I was defending her dad, but no where did I ever agree that he was right to force her to major in CE and not BME at college, nor did I ever excuse his possible abuse to her. I've always helped her out with classes, had really deep talks with her till 6 AM, tried to set her up with my friend who she had a crush on, and walked her home several times. For her to immediately throw it all away means I might've done something serious, but she's not telling. 

I tried asking on 3 separate occasions through different platforms if she wants to talk about it or if there's something I did that was offensive, but she continues to evade it and it's only becoming a bigger problem now that our friend groups are figuring out that there's tension between us. Why am I reaching out to her? Damage control, I guess. We're really close family friends and I basically have to see her almost every day of my college life because of our living situations and friend groups. If I want college and every family gathering to not be a shitshow after this, I have no choice but to do something. 

At this point, I've become frustrated being used as a punching bag that I've decided I'm not gonna talk to her either, especially since she refuses to tell me what I might've done wrong. I've thought about letting people in our friend groups know how she's been acting, but am afraid of becoming ""that guy"" that radicalizes the group against one person. 

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-24,"AITA for my friend choosing to ghost me? Edit: made it more well-written and structured to make the situation easier to understand

Context: this friend and I live close to each other and go to the same university, so we hung out a lot and even carpooled to get to campus plenty of times. I communicated once that she really abused my boundaries by disrespecting my privacy once, to which she said ""I don't want to talk about this right now,"" then gave me the silent treatment. If you can tell by now, she's a terrible communicator in general, which I always thought was alright because everyone is different. 

The current situation: From my point of view, we hung out a lot during finals before summer break, then when we got home, biked together. Soon, I learn that her dad and her had a huge argument which strained their relationship or something, so I asked her if she was alright. No response. I try a couple days later, and still nothing. She's mostly gone dark and not messaging anyone so our friend group is obviously all worried for her, me included. 

Then, a month later she comes back and starts messaging in group chats. But she only interacts with me once after that, then never again. She starts ghosting me privately and avoiding me in all group settings, so I'm wondering what the hell is going on. So I message her again, asking if there's some way I might've offended her somehow and ask to talk about it, still no response.

120,1dn7m9n,AITA for making my mum cry after I complained about her boyfriend? ,"I’ve been trying to get some washing done for the last few days, starting with my bedding. I’m at work and college almost everyday so I have very limited times I can do this. I chucked it in the wash before I went to college and when I came home, it was taken out and left on the floor all day to smell. We don’t have a garden or open space so we can only use a dryer. 

I asked everyone if they did it, and no one opened up to it. So the next day I washed it and stayed up really late to put it in the dryer. I went to work the next day, under the impression that the dryer had done its job but apparently it hadn’t fully dried. I asked my sister while I was at work to check on it for me but she didn’t. I came home and it was chucked on my bed, wet, and stinking from being left out and damp.

I was fed up because I had this conversation with everyone the day before that we can’t just take other peoples washing out if it’s not finished, and if someone has forgotten to dry, or is at work and doesn’t have time to dry, we can do it for them, doesn’t take much effort. I do it for everyone all the time. I always wash and dry my family’s stuff if they have left it in the washer or dryer, I would never just take it out and chuck it on the floor to stink all day. 

I complained in our family group chat again and my mums boyfriend came in my room and started screaming at me that apparently I do this to his stuff so he can do it to my stuff. Let me just confirm that I do not do this. I have washed, dried and folded their clothes countless times. And he knew this would upset me because I complained about it the day before but he did it anyway. 

We were screaming at eachother so I left and went to my grandparents house to get away from the situation. My mum texted me while I was there, taking the side of her boyfriend. They started ganging up on me saying how I’m a messy person, I never do anything, I’m lazy, and I can’t have anyone over till I sort my life out. I understand I can be messy but why did they use this to make what he did seem okay?

I came home and decided to be the bigger person and just go to my room and not feed fire to the situation. My mum came in my room, screaming and crying at me, like actually crying, saying that I make her feel like a bad mum, I never help her with anything, and I have no right to be annoyed at what happened because I’m selfish. 

I didn’t know what to do, she was actually crying and I can’t understand why I’m not allowed to be annoyed. Usually when things happen to me, I keep my mouth shut, her boyfriend is a cunt. I hate him. He does shit all the time and I never speak up or defend my self. This was the first time I defended myself in a situation he caused and it ended up in my mum crying upset. I feel like I’m not allowed to have MY own feelings but everyone else is. 

I do feel extremely sad that she was upset and crying tho.

This is not what she wants. She wants me to take on more of the chores we agreed would be hers. On top of earning all the money, and all the chores I currently have. 

I asked her what she wanted me to do. She gave me a list. I hired a cleaning service and paid for it out of our budget before splitting the fun money.

Now she says that I'm an asshole and being financially abusive.

122,1dn719o,AITA for asking my sister to switch rooms?,"I (28F) asked my sister (24F) to switch rooms with me. I still live at home with our parents and she lives in an apartment roughly an hour away. Her old room at this house is still her room and it's bigger than mine because she shares it with our brother. Our brother (20M) has an on campus apartment for college and has already approved the switch but my sister said no.

In my current room, I have enough space for a bed, a dresser, a bookshelf, and a bench that I use for storage. There's no more room for any more furniture. The other, bigger room, has two dressers, a bunk bed, and a desk. What I really want is room for a desk so I can work inside the house somewhere that's not a common living area like the kitchen. 

My current workspace is either the dining room table or a shed in the backyard that currently houses my desk. We live in California and the shed gets too hot to be out there for very long even with multiple fans running. My computer also overheats out there.

When I asked my sister, she said ""I think it's a silly idea - I don't want to go move/sort through all of my stuff, and I really don't want you moving it, just so you can have like one extra square foot of space"". We went back and forth for a bit but she ultimately said no outright.

123,1dn705a,AITA for banning my sister from family parties because of her attitude towards kids?,"I 41M am the oldest of five. My sister, Vera (31F) is the third child. Our parents are long dead.

Now, my sister was always the quiet one, she never interacted with us much as a child, instead, she spent most time in her room, reading. She barely spoke and when she did, she had different conversation topics. She was gifted, I get it, but we were kids and got bored when she talked so we just didn't get along.

Fast forward, Vera nos works optimizing administrative processes for big companies. She's very authoritative, strategic and overconfident. Even her boyfriend would not take a business or financial decision without consulting her first because he's convinced she's the holy grial of management. I get it, she's good at what she does, has a big salary, and has good connections, but she's just a bit much.

One point here is that Vera is the only sibling who has no kids and apparently her boyfriend got a vasectomy a few months ago. Good for him.

Thing is, when we gather at our childhood home all my siblings bring along their kids, kids are kids, they are loud and like to play. They are sensitive too.

Vera doesn't seem to understand this, she greets the kids from a distance, never hugs them and if one of them comes to her she will keep them at arm length, will be polite but way too serious and somehow cold with them. Neither my siblings nor me like this, or the way she will refuse to do ""uppies"" with the toddlers or just refuse to play along with the older kids who want to make questions, or just talk like kids do. Let alone will watch the kids even for 15 minutes (would not ask more from her).

Anyway, her behavior got worse after the last family gathering. She brought along her laptop because she had some work to do, and one of the kids dropped it accidentally, damaging the screen. She went totally ballistic and demanded my youngest sister (who is a single mom living on welfare at the moment) paid the repair. After some reasoning she dropped the subject, but then, she proceeded to stay even further away from the kids.

Hence, I spoke to my siblings and concluded it was best if we didn't invite her over for the next gathering, that was this weekend. I knew she would see the photos on Instagram, but I so hoped she would see how her attitude had isolated her and would learn a lesson.

Boy, I was wrong. She sent me a short, dead cold message asking why she wasn't invited, I told her the reason and told her we expected her to behave like a member of the family if she wanted to be treated like family. She responded ""Okay"" and proceeded to block us everywhere. Not only her, her boyfriend did too.

I (25M) live with my boyfriend (28M) and our roommate (25M). Last night, my roommate went off at me for playing Fortnite in the common area of our house.

The common area is where my desk is located because I want to separate my study area from my sleeping area. The house has an office, which is my boyfriend’s gaming room, but there isn't enough room to put my desk in there. We also have a connected garage, but since it's winter, it's too cold to be in there at night.

My roommate's complaint is that I am too loud playing Fortnite (Yes, i wear headphones) while he is trying to watch TV. In the past two weeks, I've probably played Fortnite three times for a total of about nine hours. Throughout the week, I usually sit at my desk on YouTube with headphones in.

It's worth mentioning that every day of the week, my roommate is laid out on the couch watching TV until he goes to bed around 9 PM. He has a TV in his room, but prefers to watch in the common area. Additionally, my boyfriend frequently goes to his office to watch TV because the common area TV is always taken when he gets home from work.

We also have a connected garage, but since it's winter, it's too cold to be in there at night.

My roommate's complaint is that I am too loud playing Fortnite (Yes, i wear headphones) while he is trying to watch TV. In the past two weeks, I've probably played Fortnite three times for a total of about nine hours. Throughout the week, I usually sit at my desk on YouTube with headphones in.

It's worth mentioning that every day of the week, my roommate is laid out on the couch watching TV until he goes to bed around 9 PM. He has a TV in his room, but prefers to watch in the common area. Additionally, my boyfriend frequently goes to his office to watch TV because the common area TV is always taken when he gets home from work.

128,1dn6fbx,AITAH for having more than one friend?,"
My trio: H, J&Me
So, H told me she met 2 new friends, let's call them A and C. I didn't know them, but I didn't mind. I told her I met a few other friends too, but she said ""ditch them, they're weirdos."" I didn't tho, obviously. A few weeks pass, and H goes to sit with her other friends quite frequently, and I didn't care at all, because J and I don't have to be her only friends. One day I told H that J and I would sit somewhere else, just for today, and that H could go sit with A and C. She got pissed at this, and said that we are always trying to ditch her. I pointed out that she sits with others frequently and I didn't get mad, so we can have other friends too, and it was just for today. She told her other friends, who told their friends, and eventually rumours are going around that J and I ditched H in the worst way possible. I still didn't care tho. She would still insult me regularly, and I still brushed it off as a joke. But when A and C started doing it too, even tho I don't know them, I knew they were crossing the line. I told them it's none of their goddamn business, and that they should stay away from me. But by this point, I was getting harrased by numbers I don't even know, because H gave away my number without any of my permission. I ended up blocking them on everything. I didn't tell my parents much, tho. She turned practically the whole school on me in the span of about 3 weeks. By this point, I just told her that we aren't friends anymore, and so did J, as J said that she didn't want to be friends with someone like her. She badmouthed me to J, too. I woke up one morning to the gc bombing, and turns out they were badmouthing me there too. So  I blocked their number, too. And I made a video about it, and H confronted me the next day, asking me to stop making vids like that, even tho I only made two; one for each channel. She had some nerve to say that, after all she did to me. That weekend was Mothers Day, and it just so happens that H had her bday on Mothers Day. My parents are divorced, so spending quality time with my mom meant a lot to me, and when H told me about a sleepover that weekend, I declined and stated my reasoning. The next day (Saturday; the day before Mother's Day), the gc with H's other friends I hadn't blocked yet was sending photos of them having a blast at a party, not a sleepover. I asked them abt it, and they said ""H didn't tell you?"" ""No, but if I had just known, I would've been able to come."" I was pretty upset, especially since J went, but she told me that it wasn't really that fun, since H was only talking with her other friends. So, J and I cut her off completely the next day, and reminded her of how she put us down so much, and how we don't want to deal with it anymore because it isn't worth it. She yelled at us, saying that we ditched her for no reason, when the only reason she started rumours was because she was upset we sat with other people for one day. So since then, we've never talked.

I female (21) and my fiancé male (20) are planning to get married next fall. (Yes I know we are young please don’t lecture just need advice on this one topic). For a little context behind why I do not want them at the wedding. For starts they abandon my fiancé when he was only 8 years old. They dropped him off at his grandparents and only came around once or twice a month until his grandmother passed away and he began working. His mother is bipolar and has had many breakdowns about “not seeing him” even though she left when he was 8. I do understand having health conditions BUT she has hurt herself and has threatened to hurt him. So in my opinion she needs more serious help. Also his father is a drug abuser and has broken into our house and stolen my fiancé grandmothers rings and pawn them to fuel his gambling addiction. Also his father blames my fiancé for the mothers bipolar issues. So back to why I don’t want them at the wedding if all that wasn’t enough. My family is VERY religious. Due to the fact his father is on drugs he constantly repeats himself and talks about his drugs and what is “best to take”. The first day I met him he told me how to pass a drug test. He brought it up I do absolutely no drugs whatsoever I’m a nurse and my fiancé is a lineman who is drug test often. Our wedding is also going to be very small 30 people at the most. So if either of them have a “episode” it will be very obvious and more than likely ruin the wedding. I’m trying so hard to be the bigger person and not seem to be the bridezilla. But honestly I want our wedding to be a fun and enjoyable day I do not want to constantly be worrying what they will say or do.

there’s five of us on this trip and we’re driving a few hours away to the beach . she originally wanted to take one car for the road trip experience but that’s just not reasonable due to the amount of luggage so I proposed that I could drive my car and we can split the group up to make the drive up less insufferable.

Hope was already a little upset abt that but she understood. I then said that i wanted to leave at 5 am to beat the traffic on the beltway (Hope was leaving at 12 pm), and the one passenger i was gonna bring (who wasn’t hope) agreed to leaving at 5 am. Hope then proceeded to rant to my friend about how she put in all the work and i did nothing and that it annoyed her i got to leave early. she also said, “she did none of the work and gets all of the benefit.” Another complaint she had was that im “starting the vacation without her.” All I had in mind was leaving early to avoid traffic and then just sleeping / relaxing on the beach until she got there and then I’d meet her at the air bnb. I didn’t think it would upset anyone if 2/5 of us had a few extra hours on the beach.

Keep this in mind, i paid my 400$ to the air bnb just like everyone else. Also the reason she had to leave at 12 pm is because her boyfriend (who is also going on the trip) had a dentist appointment at 11 am. her and i talked about it a little and she said everyone she talked to said it was rude and shitty of me to want to leave at 5 am, but everyone i’ve talked to about it thinks she’s crazy so i’m at a bit of a stalemate.

133,1dn5zdb,AITA trying to get pregnant - partner smoking weed again,"
I’m almost 36. My male partner is 40. 
We decided to try for a kid in Feb 2023. Did some research on ways to enhance fertility esp at these “older” ages. Together we opted to stop drinking and for him to cease smoking weed. He used to smoke A LOT of weed so this was a big sacrifice for him. This move increased our test results exponentially - but still no baby success. 

We were sober until March 2024 and slowly he has been smoking weed at night and I’ve indulged in an occasional drink or two during the week. Happened naturally tbh. 
I recently broached us picking back up both and what the game plan is on the kid front - essentially I alluded to the fact i am disappointed we’ve fallen back into old habits and maybe we take the summer “off” from trying and some emotional relief from this all. 

As a women I have a lot of mixed emotions on all this - basically feel like we are “throwing in the towel” which I vocalized to him.  He says smoking masks his pain since he has bad knees and a shoulder gym injury. He says it helps for much needed pain relief. Research shows that smoking reduces male fertility by 30%. I said well if he is smoking then I would like to continue to have a drink or two. he pointed out that if we are doing this for health, then alcohol isn’t the move. I said well I am happy not to drink then. I also assumed him hearing how I was upset about him picking up this habit again and our fertility issues would deter him… nope he is smoking even more now post this chat including afternoons and evenings. 
I feel awful and sad about the whole outcome. And jealous he can “indulge’”  and I can’t - which is embarrassing and sad to admit. 

Aim I being ridiculous and overreacting?

134,1dn5ya8,AITA for moving out w/o saying anything and making my sister pay the full rent on her own?,"I (31F) met my “sister” when I was 16. My parents did foster care and took her in. She was a few months older than myself and had a very traumatic past but was very sweet and we got along great.  She worked at McDonald's With this friend of hers named Becky that I really didn't like. She seemed to always be taking advantage of my sister but she didn't have many other friends.

 She aged out of foster care during our Sr. Year while still living with my parents. She eventually decided to leave and I didn't hear from her again for almost a year after graduation and when I did she needed help. She signed a lease to move into an apartment with Becky and her boyfriend and they backed out but she was the only one that signed and she can't afford it on her own. My mom even begged me to move in with her.

I recently had to drain all my savings and nearly every dime of my last paycheck and they wanted me to move in a day or two. I told them I'm broke and can't afford this but they knew why I was hurting financially. My sister offered to pay for groceries until I get on my feet again. I reluctantly agreed and my boyfriend and I moved in with her. 

A little over a week later it was payday but I had to wait until midnight. I had $6 to my name and decided to treat my boyfriend and myself to the McDonald's $ menu so we hit the drive through. Becky was working. I was always nice to her but I think she could tell I didn't trust her. I'm not saying it was her fault that our order was messed up 3 times but either way my boyfriend went inside and they had a verbal altercation and we left. 

We asked that Becky not be allowed into the house anymore to which my sister agreed and seemed understanding. However that night she brought not only Becky but also Becky's boyfriend over to the house. We were pissed but we just went and sat in our room all night as they also had our vehicle blocked in.

That night without my glasses on I thought I saw something suspicious happening in the living room when I snuck down for a glass of water. Becky was sitting in a chair next to the couch where her boyfriend was but my sister was on the floor in front of the boyfriend facing him and my gut told me something was off.

The next morning we found my favorite blanket, our tv remote and our Playstation controllers on top of a suspicious stain on the couch exactly where the boyfriend had been sitting the night before. The disrespect was astounding after doing her such a favor and asking for one in return. We told her to go Becky's if she wants to hang out, just not here. But what she did was beyond the disrespect of bringing Becky into our home.

We moved out that day without saying a word to her or paying her a dime. It's been years, neither have apologizes and I do feel a little guilty but not sure if I should.

We moved out that day without saying a word to her or paying her a dime. It's been years, neither have apologizes and I do feel a little guilty but not sure if I should. So AITA?",0.0,0.01775369979441166,0,1

The issue is now that she is making zero money. She works one day a week, isn't making enough money to pay her bills and is struggling. My sister called me the other day and told me that my moms power and water were going to be shut off due to non payment on the 28th. I work a full time job and could afford to help so i called her and asked her if i could pay them for her and she was completely dismissive of my help. She told me she did not want mine or anyone elses help. I ignored her and sent her the money anyway and told her to pay them and she told me she would think about it. 

The following day, i go over to her house and ask if she paid them and she says no. I then angrily tell her to send my money back and she does which makes me cry. I go to my sisters house and she asks what my mom is going to do and i say im unsure at this point because i am upset. My mom then texts my sister to say that she has no choice but to be homeless now because i asked her to send my money back. 

The guilt and shame i feel is off the charts. I do not want her to struggle and i do not want her to be without but she will not accept my help. She told me she wasn't even going to use my money, she was just going to let it sit there until the 28th then send it back. I am at my wits end and i am so depressed and hurt.

136,1dn5gax,WIBTA for telling my husband he's disrespectful and rude? ," I (26f) have been married to my husband, B (26m) for almost a year now. We have been together for 10 years. He wasn't always the way he's been the past 4 yrs but it's actually getting really stressful for me. 

I'm a SAHM. I bake on commission but that's it as far as my own money goes. 

Anyway, here's the issue. He goes through my phone. That's not really a problem. The worst he'll come across is a half written book. The issue is he doesn't ask. I ALWAYS ask before I touch his phone. He does it to my laptop too. He's gone through my diary before too. I'm not allowed any privacy. I've never cheated on him, never given him a reason to believe i have yet when I get upset about the invasion he accuses me of it. 

I don't really have anything that's mine. I don't have hobbies beyond baking. I no longer have the attention span to read. All I do is take care of the house and the kids. 

All I have is my privacy and he seems to take joy in taking it away. 

Here's where I might be the asshole. 

B is VERY insecure. Always has been. I know he has trust issues and going through my phone brings him a sense of security. He also really enjoys my writing. So he goes into my notes and Google docs and reads my stories. I know this. 

I just HATE my privacy being invaded. Which he knows. 

So. WIBTA?

Edit: Just answering a few questions. Know. He's not in the military. His mom didn't cheat. His dad did after consistently preaching against the sin of adultery (we grew up in different sects of the same extreme religious group and met a few years after our mothers escaped).

We made all these plans for the day after my bday. I'm super excited. But she also says, oh hey I'm trying these new pills out and it makes me dizzy. Now that I look back at it, maybe she premeditated what she was going to do.

138,1dn5aaj,AITA Inappropriate father in law,"AITA Inappropriate father in law

Im in a discussion with my boyfriend whether or not his dad is inappropriate and should be put in place. 

My father in law is easiest described as a man who talks loudly about women, money, foreigners or politics. His statements is ALLWAYS completely ""off"", and I often feel umcomfortable in the conversation. 

A few days ago he said I should have had an abortion  - while i sat with our son on the lap. Our son is very sick, and it is a hard time for our family. Also he told me to quit my job to homecare our to boys, so my boyfriend can focus on his career and as a woman i should tale care of the home ect. 

So today at a dinner party i had enough. My father in law talked severel times about women body and he makes me feel inappropriate.  He constantly evaluates women's bodies. 

So i told my boyfriend when we got home, that i think it is inappropriate and I dont like to be around him when he acts like that. Also i want my boyfriend to tell his dad to turn it down a bit. And here starts the discussion.... 

My boyfriend says that his father "" is what he is"", and I should pack away my feelings. I try to explain to him that it is disrespectful to talk about other people's bodies like that and that it is a general culture for men to comment on women's bodies. My boyfriend gets offended and says that it is natural that we evaluate other bodies etc.
 I am again trying to articulate a culture which contributes to women feeling their bodies are made to be discussed and creates, for example, a great deal of insecurity. He thinks that men are allowed to do that and I should relax. 

He asks me why I have suddenly become so feminist. I answer that it is because it has Surprised me me how much I as a woman actually experience as offensive and disrespectful. He says ""oh okay so because you gave birth to a child or what?"" (I have previously stated an inequality in relation to becoming parents)

I get hurt and feel insecure. He also says that he can also say whether he thinks someone is sexy. I leave very mad. 

So, AITA for wanting my boyfriend to speak up, and maybe be open to the fact that this culture exist ? 

Also... I dont want my kids to learn that it is okay to speak about other peoples bodies that way. It is also a perspective.


UPDATE:

So I tried to talk to my bf again, and we disagree even more.

From his point of view, he believes that it is okay to comment on a woman's body, whether it is sexually attractive, as long as it is not in front of the person. As an example, he mentions a female colleague who all men talk about is beautiful. He thinks that's okay, but that it's only disrespectful if some men flirt with her directly. 

He describes that she herself is strong and good at speaking up and fighting for her colleagues to respect her skills. He believes that we women should be able to do that, because we cannot mannage what others think and say. 

I explain again that it is precisely the problem that the body becomes an object of sexual assessment - and even if the person does not hear about it, it is the culture that is a problem.  

I showed him this post and he doesn't think I described it correctly. Because during the same dinner party he told his father that he should stop talking about lesbians all the time. So he feels that he can say something to his father - he just doesn't agree that the way he talks about women is wrong. Furthermore, his argument is that we women are even worse than men. That I'm a hypocrite because I myself can speak badly of a colleague to him or that when we watch movies I comment on an actor's appearance. My bf said no to couples therapy as he thinks I should just admit that he doesn't agree with me.

141,1dn56kt,AITA for hanging out with my best friends ex?,"I (F18) recently hung out with my best friends ex boyfriend in a group setting. I have been in a trio friend group with two other girls (“Rachel” and “Alice”) for the past 5 years. They have always been a little closer to each other than with me because they have known each other since preschool, but for the most part that has never been an issue. My one best friend “Rachel” started dating a guy I set her up with around 1 1/2 years ago, after dating for five months she found out he had cheated on her. At this point him and his friends had become a part of our friend group and we all hung out often. I personally had become very close with many of his friends and considered him to be a friend as well. After “Rachel” and “Alex” broke up we had all decided that we would continue being a friend group and hanging out with each other because we had already all become so close. Now a year later, I went to the park with a couple of the guys and played pickleball, my best friend’s ex “Alex” was also there. While we were at the park I turned off my location, because one of the guys who was previously a part of our friend group and had been dropped for a very good reason was known to stalk our locations and show up wherever we were. 2 days after we all hung out at the park I decided I was going to host a party at my house and invited my best friends “Rachel” and “Alice”, but they both immediately responded “no”. I thought it was odd but didn’t read too much into it until “Rachel” left me on open. When I asked her what was wrong she proceeded to tell me how she had been stalking my location and when I turned it off she figured I was hanging out with “Alex”. She went on to tell me that I was intentionally going behind her back (which was never the case). She also said that the guys I am friends with are bad people, so by default I am a bad person, and for that reason she doesn’t know if she can be friends with me anymore. I explained to her that I truly believe these guys are good people and I was not trying to hangout with her ex, I only ever see him because he happens to still be a part of the same friend group. She then said that I need to choose between all of my other friends and her. After this conversation ended a few days went by and I let it be, assuming that we would come back around to it, when I realized that both “Rachel” and “Alice” were reposting things about being better off in a two person friend group. Obviously I was really hurt and blindsided, so I reached out to them and tried to see what was going on but they both ignored me. They both completely dropped me over night after 5 years of being each other’s closest friends. I’m trying to understand now what I did that was worth losing my two best friends.

While we were at the park I turned off my location, because one of the guys who was previously a part of our friend group and had been dropped for a very good reason was known to stalk our locations and show up wherever we were. 2 days after we all hung out at the park I decided I was going to host a party at my house and invited my best friends “Rachel” and “Alice”, but they both immediately responded “no”. I thought it was odd but didn’t read too much into it until “Rachel” left me on open. When I asked her what was wrong she proceeded to tell me how she had been stalking my location and when I turned it off she figured I was hanging out with “Alex”. She went on to tell me that I was intentionally going behind her back (which was never the case). She also said that the guys I am friends with are bad people, so by default I am a bad person, and for that reason she doesn’t know if she can be friends with me anymore. I explained to her that I truly believe these guys are good people and I was not trying to hangout with her ex, I only ever see him because he happens to still be a part of the same friend group. She then said that I need to choose between all of my other friends and her. After this conversation ended a few days went by and I let it be, assuming that we would come back around to it, when I realized that both “Rachel” and “Alice” were reposting things about being better off in a two person friend group. Obviously I was really hurt and blindsided, so I reached out to them and tried to see what was going on but they both ignored me. They both completely dropped me over night after 5 years of being each other’s closest friends. I’m trying to understand now what I did that was worth losing my two best friends.

142,1dn542i,AITA for declining my husband's invitation to a formal dinner? ,"My husband (m72) is a devout Catholic man who belongs to the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic men's fraternal organization. Every year they host a Columbus Day Ball, a formal dinner and dance.

I (f68) have a number of reasons for declining to attend these things. First is the food. They ask $75 per person. At least half the time I've found the food to be inedible. ""Prime rib"" that was a slab of fat and gristle with two or three thumbnail-size bits of meat. Chicken coated with a mustard glaze, to which I am violently allergic. (And yes, the facility was told about it ahead of time and assured us that I would be served something else. They lied.) Buffets that run out of food before half the diners have been served and try to hurry more food out from the kitchens, cold and only partially cooked. Vegetables so heavily seasoned as to be inedible. Drinks are only alcohol or coffee/tea, all of which you have to get up and get for yourself. I'm tired of paying that kind of price for a ""meal"" of a tiny salad that consists of two cherry tomato halves & a lettuce leaf, and a 2-inch square of stale, tasteless chocolate cake.  

Waitstaff slap the food on the table like they're sloppin' hawgs and disappear, never to be seen again. Management is nowhere to be found.

Endless dull speeches where every local, district, and state officer is introduced by his long, high-falutin' title. Then the DJs turn up the music to 150 decibels, so that your neighbor has to scream directly in your ear to be heard. Instant migraine time.

Husband gave me the flyer for the one that will be held this fall. I said no thank you, dear. He got upset and demanded to know why not. I told him why, in basically the same words as above. He was even more butt-hurt.  

And it's not like it's the only time of year we can see each other, or our only meal out. We're retired. We can see each other all day every day. 

So, AITA for declining to pay $75 for the privilege of a very minimal ""meal"", immense boredom, and intense physical pain?

146,1dn4exm,AITA for leaving a family vacation,"So my husband M(35) and myself F(30) went on a family vacation and stayed at an airbnb (Fri-Mon) with about 9 other adults, 3 kids, 2 dogs and 1 two year old. Kids and 1 dog are not ours. 

Our Malshi is protective so he barks when people come in the front door or if he hears loud sounds. He just needs to be petted or sniffs you or he just stops after you sit or a few seconds. (This is important for the story)

The two year old and the parents decide to sleep on the first floor where the majority of people are hanging out but when the 2 year old is trying to sleep everyone has to be quiet and they get mad at my dog for barking. 

Well on the third day they all went somewhere and we stayed at the airbnb with a few others. So we all were talking and having a good time. When they came back the 2 year old apparently was trying to sleep so as soon as they get back they start (kids name is sleeping) and people start shushing everyone and since they’re sleeping on the first floor everyone has to be quiet. 

As people continue to come in and kids running up the stairs our dog barks here and there. The dad comes out and demands my husband to take our dog somewhere else cause the child is trying to sleep. The way he said it was pretty rude and demanding. So we got up and left back home. 

First of all we’re all on vacation having a great time. We all paid to be there etc. I definitely feel it’s inconsiderate of them to ask everyone to be quiet when they could have also taken the child to the 3 or 4th floor where no one was and empty rooms were still available. 

If we were at their house. I get it. But not in this case .

Also, I know so many babies and kids that don’t need it so hush and quiet when they sleep. It’s so annoying honestly. So AITA here?


UPDATES: 
I appreciate everyone taking the time to write and give advice/opinions whether I am or I am not an AH. 

Few things to clarify for everyone asking. 
1) we did not tell them or confront them about the “take your kid upstairs” because we didn’t want to cause a scene and plus we left cause we no longer felt comfortable. Especially my husband since the way his BIL talked to him. I obviously don’t know how everyone felt about being shushed but I know I don’t like that especially on vacation.
2) my dog doesn’t bark all the time. He’s barking to alarm us that people are at the front door or if he senses danger. He’s not yapping 24/7. But I also understand that everyone doesn’t like to hear dogs bark at all. I’m not justifying his behavior.
3) everyone knew we were taking the dog as (SIL) had told us that we can bring him and they have met the dog and we retold her that yes, he barks) 
4) the other dog doesn’t bark or make noise. She won’t alarm you even if you’re getting robbed or murdered. 
5) this happened when they came back to the Airbnb to pretty much expect everyone to start being quiet cause their child was trying to sleep.
6) even when the dog wasn’t barking people were still being shushed. This would have happened still if he was there or not. 
7) idk how others felt about the situation and everyone seemed to love my dog (but i obviously don’t know)
8) both parents stay in bed with the child throughout the whole nap portion all the time. (So the child wouldn’t wake on its own and “fall down stairs”) 
9) this wouldn’t have bothered us as much if he said it nicely or we were at his house and not on vacation.

In conclusion: I will not bring my dog on vacation but I will also not go on vacation with them. If I ever were to I’d stay somewhere else.

148,1dn4400,AITA for taking legal action after repairing friends car,"I helped a friend, who isn’t the best off financially, find a cheap car that I could repair for them so that they could have a good vehicle at a low price. Found a BMW 330i for $1500 (CAD) that ran and drove along with being pretty rust free but had trouble starting, a couple engine codes, and a shifting problem in reverse, I took time to find causes and fixes of the codes/issues then looked up parts and totalled it all up and added a bit for a bit of “just in case”. Got back to friend with my estimate of “no more than $1500 to repair if nothing more is wrong and I’m right about the issues” they said that was great and bought the car then gave it over to me to fix, I ordered the parts and started working on it, I made sure to send them photos and videos throughout to show what I was doing and why I was replacing said item, over time managed to fix almost all of the issues, and was well within my price estimate sitting at about $900 in parts. I also made sure to do maintenance items to guarantee it would be good for some time (plugs, oil, coolant, belts etc) and now just had to fix the transmission issue which was common for this year and I had initially figured would be cheap ish fix however upon opening the transmission up I realized it was far worse than I guessed needing a full rebuild, I told my friend that I would have to bring it to a shop and get an estimate from them, friend okayed it. Brought it to a transmission shop and the estimate was about $5k, let friend know and they said it was too much for them to afford so I gave them the option of me putting it on my LoC or could sell the car and cut losses, they said they needed a vehicle and would pay back the LoC so I  approved the work. After all this was able to get it safetied and ready to be registered then went to give it back to them, at this point they went off on me for costing them too much money despite approving any repairs I did, and that I used it for personal use and taken it for joyrides as once I picked it up from shop it was getting safetied at then took it to work and drove to garage to get last few things for safety done which I had told them about and they said was fine, I also soon after found out through mutual friends that they thought I had purposefully broken things to charge them more for repairs despite not charging any labour. So I figured I might not get repaid and opted to write up an invoice and file a lien on the vehicle then made them sign it before handing over the safety certificate after this they blocked me on everything and completely cut me off. Did I go too far by “forcing” them to repay me and was I unprofessional or shady in my tactics when doing the repairs?

TLDR; Repaired a car for a friend and costs overrun but were approved by friend then they got upset with me and said I fucked them over so I made them sign an invoice and filed a lien on the car to ensure I got repaid

I also made sure to do maintenance items to guarantee it would be good for some time (plugs, oil, coolant, belts etc) and now just had to fix the transmission issue which was common for this year and I had initially figured would be cheap ish fix however upon opening the transmission up I realized it was far worse than I guessed needing a full rebuild, I told my friend that I would have to bring it to a shop and get an estimate from them, friend okayed it. Brought it to a transmission shop and the estimate was about $5k, let friend know and they said it was too much for them to afford so I gave them the option of me putting it on my LoC or could sell the car and cut losses, they said they needed a vehicle and would pay back the LoC so I  approved the work. After all this was able to get it safetied and ready to be registered then went to give it back to them, at this point they went off on me for costing them too much money despite approving any repairs I did, and that I used it for personal use and taken it for joyrides as once I picked it up from shop it was getting safetied at then took it to work and drove to garage to get last few things for safety done which I had told them about and they said was fine, I also soon after found out through mutual friends that they thought I had purposefully broken things to charge them more for repairs despite not charging any labour. So I figured I might not get repaid and opted to write up an invoice and file a lien on the vehicle then made them sign it before handing over the safety certificate after this they blocked me on everything and completely cut me off. Did I go too far by “forcing” them to repay me and was I unprofessional or shady in my tactics when doing the repairs?

TLDR; Repaired a car for a friend and costs overrun but were approved by friend then they got upset with me and said I fucked them over so I made them sign an invoice and filed a lien on the car to ensure I got repaid

153,1dn3l5s,AITA for moving out w/o saying anything and making my sister pay the full rent on her own?,"Throw away account...

This story happened over 10 years ago but recently one of these stories brought this memory flooding back... 

I (31 female) grew up with parents that did foster care. It all started when they were asked to take in my older cousins (whom I now refer to as my brothers). I was about 7 or 8 years old then. They got into some trouble in their late teens and aged out of the system in juvie. After the boys moved out, my parents took a year or two off before renewing their license. For the next few years our house was a revolving door for children in the system.

We had more kids in and out of our house then I can even remember. Some stayed for a day or two and some for a few months, all depending on their reunification plan or respite schedule. One of the last kids we took in was a girl that was only a few months older than myself. By this time I was 16, a Jr. In high school and so excited because I had always wanted a sister close to my age. I was in and out of the house a lot and in the process of slowly moving in with my then boyfriend when she came to us. We didn't have much in common but she was sweet and we got along well. To avoid using her name I'll just refer to her as my sister going forward.

My sister had a very sad upbringing. I have enough respect for her to not air out that trauma here but it's important to know that she was severely taken advantage of and traumatized growing up and as a result of that, easily manipulated. It didn't take long for me to call her my sister and although she was older than myself, I understood how vulnerable she was and therefore felt the need to protect her. I kept my eye on her at school and in social situations to make sure she was OK. She had this one friend in particular, let's call her Becky, that I kept a closer eye on as I just did not trust her. However they worked together at McDonald's and that was one place I couldn't have an eye on them because I didn't work there. My sister had told me a few things that were major red flags about Becky and I expressed to her over and over that I thought her friend was taking advantage of her. It ranged from money, school assignments and even work shifts. My sister just couldn't say no. She didn't have many friends either and was never interested in hanging out with me and my friends so she stayed loyal to Becky. By that summer I had pretty much fully moved in with my then boyfriend and the opportunities for us to catch up became less and less. 

My sister aged out of foster care, while living in my parents home, during our Sr. Year of high school. Because she was now an adult she was given the choice to stay with them for the remainder of the school year or move out on her own. She chose to stay at first but it didn't take long for her to get into contact with her bio mom again and she decided to move out. I lost contact with her for a while after that, and not for lack of trying as I was very concerned for her in her new living situation. I had heard a few rumors about her living back at her bio mom's and still being in contact with Becky as well as possibly having a shared relationship with Becky’s boyfriend and I was even more concerned for her well-being after hearing that considering her past.

Graduation came and went and that summer was wild. My parents split up and had a messy divorce and I dove head first into the party scene to numb my pain. It wasn't until the following spring that I finally heard anything more about my sister. My mom called explaining that my sister had signed a lease for an apartment and had planned to move in with a friend and the friend's boyfriend but they backed out at the last minute. To my understanding, neither the friend or the boyfriend signed the lease, only my sister. So now she was stuck with this apartment that she couldn't afford on her own. It wasn't until later that I learned the identity of the friend that backed out. It was none other than Becky, the same friend I had warned her about over and over again. Becky was also still dating the guy that I was worried was taking advantage of my sister. My mom was calling to ask for my boyfriend and I to consider moving in to help her out.

This was a big decision to make for us. We had been living with my boyfriends mom since I was 16 with the agreement that we would only have to pay $75 a month for rent and be in charge of the household tasks. This was in order for us to save up for our future. I wasn't working while I was in high school as I was doing night school as well. I earned my CNA my Sr. Year, took the summer off and started working the fall after graduation when I turned 18. Once I started working we both had to pay $75 a month but that was still a sweet deal! We were able to save up for a car pretty quickly but then my boyfriend got laid off for the winter. 

Just before I got this call from my mom we found out that his company couldn't afford to hire him back and he was now out of a job and his unemployment was running out. On Top of that, his mom's checks had been garnished for unpaid medical bills all winter. She chose to stop paying the gas without telling anyone. She thought she could catch up before spring when they could legally turn it off on us. By the time we found out it was too late and the gas was shut off. We spent the rest of our savings to get it turned back on and we were still short until my next paycheck. So after we paid that off we were literally broke broke. And that's when my mom called asking this favor. Not only would our rent now increase by triple the amount, our income was decreasing and we had no savings left. 

The only upside to this arraignment was that the apartment was literally across the street from my work. Rain or shine it would take 3 minutes to walk to work so we would be saving on gas even though we only lived about 3 miles from my job before that. I had a soft spot for my sister though and so we reluctantly agreed to move in with her. 

My sister was aware of our financial situation and that we had like $20 to our name but she still begged us to move in at the same time as her. She was moving in a day or two from finding this all out. I explained to her that I wouldn't get paid until the following week and wouldn't be able to afford groceries so we wanted to wait. She offered to stock the house and said something like it was the least she could do for us helping her out. We agreed we could figure out how to go about groceries after that once we all get settled in. Spoiler, we never made it that far.

She didn't have much there when we got there for furniture. She had a black futon couch and a side table in the living room. A few pots and pans and some of the other basics in the kitchen as well as a small table and a bed upstairs. We didn't have much to contribute either, a few more things for the kitchen, a recliner chair, tv and Playstation set up that we put in the living room for all of us to enjoy, plus our bed. It wasn't much but all together it made a cute little cozy home. And my sister did stock the kitchen with a variety of foods for us all to enjoy. We didn't come completely empty handed either though. We had a small collection of pantry foods we were also able to contribute.

The first few days in the apartment were pretty fun, it was like a slumber party everyday. And it just so happened that my sister and I had the first few days off together so we really rebonded over that time, or so I thought. After a couple days of catching up it was back to the real world. My sister had a car but for some reason she only got rides from Becky and her boyfriend to and from work. I assumed it was because she still worked with Becky but still found it odd. 

Everything came to a head, literally, the day I was getting paid for the first time since moving in. Technically my payday was the next day but that night at midnight was when my check would hit and my boyfriend and I had plans to do a midnight grocery run to restock the house. I typically worked the 3pm-11pm shift but that day I had switched and worked the morning. When I got home a little after 3pm my boyfriend and I were starving. We had exactly $6 to our names and we felt rich knowing I was getting paid that night. So we thought we would celebrate by hitting up the dollar menu at McDonald's. 

We went through the drive through and I ordered a McDouble with NO onions, he got a McChicken and we both got a small fry. I wasn't surprised to see Becky working the payment window and taking drive through orders. She didn't seem bothered by us so I didn't think twice about it. I've always been vocal to my sister about my concerns with Becky but have always been nice to her when she is around and try to respect their friendship while also protecting my sister.

We said hi, paid for our food and moved up in line. When we got our food we parked and checked our order and to my surprise the tag on my burger read “no onions” but there definitely were onions on that burger. No problem, mistakes happen all the time. So we drove around and told them the issue and again it was Becky taking orders but she still had us pull up to receive a new burger. She seemed slightly annoyed but not any more than most. They handed me a new burger and refused to take the first one. Again we parked to check it because the line was long and we didn't want to hold it up by checking at the window.

Unfortunately, the wrapper still had a no onion tag but this time the burger was covered in onions. Each layer had extra onions packed into it including the outside of the bun. It was like someone ordered an onion with a side of burger. My boyfriend decided to take the burger and walk in to address the situation. He had a suspicion about Becky being up to no good and wanted to avoid going back through the line and dealing with her for a third time. I was exhausted from work and decided to stay in the car so this is what happened according to my boyfriend at the time.

He went in and approached the counter and explained the situation. The worker looked at the burger and agreed that was a ridiculous amount of onions especially for being the second burger. Right then Becky came out from the back and handed her head set to another employee and told them to take over and she would deal with this. Turned out she had just been promoted to manager. She tried telling him that they couldn't make another burger, they already made him a free one. They went back and forth about the order not being done correctly and her telling him “it is what it is.”

 He said he was pretty upset having to deal with Becky of all people but did really well about keeping his cool until she made a comment about him not having a job, us not paying for groceries, yet finding money for McDonald's and we don't deserve to have our order done right because of this. He snapped at her at that point, accusing her of being a shitty friend, using my sister for years and leaving her with this apartment she cant afford on her own. I don't think we ever did get our burger but I certainly wasn't hungry anymore after all that anyway. 

When I got home I expected my sister to be there but she wasn't. I texted her and told her we needed to talk when she got home. My boyfriend and I agreed that we needed to lay down some boundaries around Becky being in our home. My sister didn't come home so I told her everything over the phone. We told her that we can't stop her from being friends with Becky but we don't feel comfortable with her having Becky in our shared home. If she can disrespect us in her place of work like that when she is supposed to be professional then how can we trust her to respect us or our belongings in our home especially if we are not home. But obviously we wouldn't do anything to stop her from hanging out with Becky at Becky's place.

 She agreed and I thought we had a mutual understanding around this. She was also super apologetic for how Bekcy acted even though I told her repeatedly it was not her fault and I felt sorry it had to be this way but I do not trust Becky. I took a nap after all of this and woke up to a text from my sister saying she was going to have a friend over that night and my heart just sank. I knew without her telling me that she was going to disrespect our agreement. I asked her who and she didn't reply. My boyfriend had the same gut feeling and now all we could do was wait.

We agreed that if she showed up with Becky that we wouldn't make a scene and just go to our room for the night. But also if that happened we would have to sit down face to face with my sister the next day and have this whole conversation over again in a much more strict way. I was just sick to my stomach waiting for her to get home. We debated on bringing our tv up to our room but then again what if she does have a different friend to bring home? So we waited and waited and waited and finally she pulled up and right behind her we saw Becky's car, with Becky and her boyfriend inside, pull up blocking our car in.

We knew then we wouldn't be doing a midnight shopping trip because neither of us wanted to talk to her even just have her move her car. Not to mention we didn't really feel comfortable leaving all our belongings for her to do what she pleases with after our altercation earlier that day. Turns out that she would have her way with our belongings even with us under the same roof as them. With nothing to do and no time to grab the TV or Playstation, we decided to go to bed early despite already napping. I couldn't sleep knowing they were in my house though. This was before the days of games and movies on our phones to distract us. So I laid there tossing and turning for what seemed like hours.

Now I am pretty blind without my glasses but every time I looked outside I could still see the shadowy figure of Becky's car parked outside. Eventually I got sick of lying in the bed and went down stairs for a glass of water. I typically would grab my glasses for this kind of adventure but something told me to just forget about them and I'm glad I did because who knows what I would have seen or the details I could have made out if I could see.

So the apartment was two stories with the bedrooms upstairs and living room and kitchen downstairs. When coming down the stairs there was a small area for a little table next to the garage door. If you turned left you would see the kitchen straight ahead but if you turned left again you'd go into the living room. As soon as I started coming downstairs I could hear them all go silent. I peeked into the living room on my way to the kitchen and instantly thought those three were up to no good.  

Becky was sitting in our recliner chair, her boyfriend was sitting next to her on the couch and my sister was sitting on the floor in front of the boyfriend facing him. All 3 seemed to be looking straight at me as I walked passed. As I got my water I could hear them whispering which made me even more uneasy. I took my water glass upstairs and peaked again as I passed back by. It looked like the boyfriend had his lap covered with my favorite blanket. I told my boyfriend what I saw when I got upstairs and he made a joke about my sister sucking the boyfriend off as some weird revenge. I told him he was gross and we laughed thinking they couldn't be that twisted. Or could they? That was one of the longest nights I have ever spent just laying in bed feeling trapped.

The next morning we were relieved to see that Becky and her boyfriend were gone but shocked to see my sister wasn't home either. She was supposed to have that morning off. We laid in bed talking for a bit and decided we were going to go get some breakfast at our favorite dinner and then go get some groceries but we made it a point to be home most of the day to catch my sister for a serious talk. I didn't want it to be an over the phone thing again. I texted her and asked where she was before we got up to get ready for the day. No surprise, Becky called her that morning asking her to work for her and she agreed like she always did. But that was fine because it gave us time to have a chill morning and get our errands done before she came home and we had to have this difficult talk.

My boyfriend and I made our way downstairs for the first time that morning together. I brought my cup straight to the sink and decided to wash up the few dishes that were in there before we left. My boyfriend said they left the living room a mess and he was going to pick it up but in the same breath he also yelled “UGH, WTF?” in a disgusted manner. I ran into the living room to see him throwing my blanket on the floor. He couldn't even tell me what's wrong. He was just pointing and rubbing his hands on his pants.

 I looked on the couch where he was pointing, the same spot Becky's boyfriend was sitting the night before. Our TV remote and Playstation controllers were sitting there. As I got closer I saw them sitting on a white stain that was on the couch and it finally clicked what my boyfriend was freaking out about. He was beyond upset about this level of disrespect and immediately called his mom and best friends to help us move our shit out. We didn't even talk about it, he just made that decision. I didn't stop him though, I didn't want to be there anymore either.

I felt some guilt for just up and leaving without saying anything and leaving her with the apartment on her own but at the same time I felt so incredibly disrespected in what was supposed to be my house too. No to mention the huge favor we did for her by moving in there in the first place. We never did end up buying groceries or helping with the rent at all being we were there for less than 2 weeks.

 But I'm curious, AITA for leaving without saying anything and without paying a dime? I do feel guilty to this day but also still feel justified.

This was in order for us to save up for our future. I wasn't working while I was in high school as I was doing night school as well. I earned my CNA my Sr. Year, took the summer off and started working the fall after graduation when I turned 18. Once I started working we both had to pay $75 a month but that was still a sweet deal! We were able to save up for a car pretty quickly but then my boyfriend got laid off for the winter. 

Just before I got this call from my mom we found out that his company couldn't afford to hire him back and he was now out of a job and his unemployment was running out. On Top of that, his mom's checks had been garnished for unpaid medical bills all winter. She chose to stop paying the gas without telling anyone. She thought she could catch up before spring when they could legally turn it off on us. By the time we found out it was too late and the gas was shut off. We spent the rest of our savings to get it turned back on and we were still short until my next paycheck. So after we paid that off we were literally broke broke. And that's when my mom called asking this favor. Not only would our rent now increase by triple the amount, our income was decreasing and we had no savings left. 

The only upside to this arraignment was that the apartment was literally across the street from my work. Rain or shine it would take 3 minutes to walk to work so we would be saving on gas even though we only lived about 3 miles from my job before that. I had a soft spot for my sister though and so we reluctantly agreed to move in with her. 

My sister was aware of our financial situation and that we had like $20 to our name but she still begged us to move in at the same time as her. She was moving in a day or two from finding this all out. I explained to her that I wouldn't get paid until the following week and wouldn't be able to afford groceries so we wanted to wait. She offered to stock the house and said something like it was the least she could do for us helping her out. We agreed we could figure out how to go about groceries after that once we all get settled in. Spoiler, we never made it that far.

She didn't have much there when we got there for furniture. She had a black futon couch and a side table in the living room. A few pots and pans and some of the other basics in the kitchen as well as a small table and a bed upstairs. We didn't have much to contribute either, a few more things for the kitchen, a recliner chair, tv and Playstation set up that we put in the living room for all of us to enjoy, plus our bed. It wasn't much but all together it made a cute little cozy home. And my sister did stock the kitchen with a variety of foods for us all to enjoy. We didn't come completely empty handed either though. We had a small collection of pantry foods we were also able to contribute.

The first few days in the apartment were pretty fun, it was like a slumber party everyday. And it just so happened that my sister and I had the first few days off together so we really rebonded over that time, or so I thought. After a couple days of catching up it was back to the real world. My sister had a car but for some reason she only got rides from Becky and her boyfriend to and from work. I assumed it was because she still worked with Becky but still found it odd. 

Everything came to a head, literally, the day I was getting paid for the first time since moving in. Technically my payday was the next day but that night at midnight was when my check would hit and my boyfriend and I had plans to do a midnight grocery run to restock the house. I typically worked the 3pm-11pm shift but that day I had switched and worked the morning. When I got home a little after 3pm my boyfriend and I were starving. We had exactly $6 to our names and we felt rich knowing I was getting paid that night. So we thought we would celebrate by hitting up the dollar menu at McDonald's. 

We went through the drive through and I ordered a McDouble with NO onions, he got a McChicken and we both got a small fry. I wasn't surprised to see Becky working the payment window and taking drive through orders. She didn't seem bothered by us so I didn't think twice about it. I've always been vocal to my sister about my concerns with Becky but have always been nice to her when she is around and try to respect their friendship while also protecting my sister.

We said hi, paid for our food and moved up in line. When we got our food we parked and checked our order and to my surprise the tag on my burger read “no onions” but there definitely were onions on that burger. No problem, mistakes happen all the time. So we drove around and told them the issue and again it was Becky taking orders but she still had us pull up to receive a new burger. She seemed slightly annoyed but not any more than most. They handed me a new burger and refused to take the first one. Again we parked to check it because the line was long and we didn't want to hold it up by checking at the window.

Unfortunately, the wrapper still had a no onion tag but this time the burger was covered in onions. Each layer had extra onions packed into it including the outside of the bun. It was like someone ordered an onion with a side of burger. My boyfriend decided to take the burger and walk in to address the situation. He had a suspicion about Becky being up to no good and wanted to avoid going back through the line and dealing with her for a third time. I was exhausted from work and decided to stay in the car so this is what happened according to my boyfriend at the time.

He went in and approached the counter and explained the situation. The worker looked at the burger and agreed that was a ridiculous amount of onions especially for being the second burger. Right then Becky came out from the back and handed her head set to another employee and told them to take over and she would deal with this. Turned out she had just been promoted to manager. She tried telling him that they couldn't make another burger, they already made him a free one. They went back and forth about the order not being done correctly and her telling him “it is what it is.”

 He said he was pretty upset having to deal with Becky of all people but did really well about keeping his cool until she made a comment about him not having a job, us not paying for groceries, yet finding money for McDonald's and we don't deserve to have our order done right because of this. He snapped at her at that point, accusing her of being a shitty friend, using my sister for years and leaving her with this apartment she cant afford on her own. I don't think we ever did get our burger but I certainly wasn't hungry anymore after all that anyway. 

When I got home I expected my sister to be there but she wasn't. I texted her and told her we needed to talk when she got home. My boyfriend and I agreed that we needed to lay down some boundaries around Becky being in our home. My sister didn't come home so I told her everything over the phone. We told her that we can't stop her from being friends with Becky but we don't feel comfortable with her having Becky in our shared home. If she can disrespect us in her place of work like that when she is supposed to be professional then how can we trust her to respect us or our belongings in our home especially if we are not home. But obviously we wouldn't do anything to stop her from hanging out with Becky at Becky's place.

 She agreed and I thought we had a mutual understanding around this. She was also super apologetic for how Bekcy acted even though I told her repeatedly it was not her fault and I felt sorry it had to be this way but I do not trust Becky. I took a nap after all of this and woke up to a text from my sister saying she was going to have a friend over that night and my heart just sank. I knew without her telling me that she was going to disrespect our agreement. I asked her who and she didn't reply. My boyfriend had the same gut feeling and now all we could do was wait.

We agreed that if she showed up with Becky that we wouldn't make a scene and just go to our room for the night. But also if that happened we would have to sit down face to face with my sister the next day and have this whole conversation over again in a much more strict way. I was just sick to my stomach waiting for her to get home. We debated on bringing our tv up to our room but then again what if she does have a different friend to bring home? So we waited and waited and waited and finally she pulled up and right behind her we saw Becky's car, with Becky and her boyfriend inside, pull up blocking our car in.

We knew then we wouldn't be doing a midnight shopping trip because neither of us wanted to talk to her even just have her move her car. Not to mention we didn't really feel comfortable leaving all our belongings for her to do what she pleases with after our altercation earlier that day. Turns out that she would have her way with our belongings even with us under the same roof as them. With nothing to do and no time to grab the TV or Playstation, we decided to go to bed early despite already napping. I couldn't sleep knowing they were in my house though. This was before the days of games and movies on our phones to distract us. So I laid there tossing and turning for what seemed like hours.

Now I am pretty blind without my glasses but every time I looked outside I could still see the shadowy figure of Becky's car parked outside. Eventually I got sick of lying in the bed and went down stairs for a glass of water. I typically would grab my glasses for this kind of adventure but something told me to just forget about them and I'm glad I did because who knows what I would have seen or the details I could have made out if I could see.

So the apartment was two stories with the bedrooms upstairs and living room and kitchen downstairs. When coming down the stairs there was a small area for a little table next to the garage door. If you turned left you would see the kitchen straight ahead but if you turned left again you'd go into the living room. As soon as I started coming downstairs I could hear them all go silent. I peeked into the living room on my way to the kitchen and instantly thought those three were up to no good.  

Becky was sitting in our recliner chair, her boyfriend was sitting next to her on the couch and my sister was sitting on the floor in front of the boyfriend facing him. All 3 seemed to be looking straight at me as I walked passed. As I got my water I could hear them whispering which made me even more uneasy. I took my water glass upstairs and peaked again as I passed back by. It looked like the boyfriend had his lap covered with my favorite blanket. I told my boyfriend what I saw when I got upstairs and he made a joke about my sister sucking the boyfriend off as some weird revenge. I told him he was gross and we laughed thinking they couldn't be that twisted. Or could they? That was one of the longest nights I have ever spent just laying in bed feeling trapped.

The next morning we were relieved to see that Becky and her boyfriend were gone but shocked to see my sister wasn't home either. She was supposed to have that morning off. We laid in bed talking for a bit and decided we were going to go get some breakfast at our favorite dinner and then go get some groceries but we made it a point to be home most of the day to catch my sister for a serious talk. I didn't want it to be an over the phone thing again. I texted her and asked where she was before we got up to get ready for the day. No surprise, Becky called her that morning asking her to work for her and she agreed like she always did. But that was fine because it gave us time to have a chill morning and get our errands done before she came home and we had to have this difficult talk.

My boyfriend and I made our way downstairs for the first time that morning together. I brought my cup straight to the sink and decided to wash up the few dishes that were in there before we left. My boyfriend said they left the living room a mess and he was going to pick it up but in the same breath he also yelled “UGH, WTF?” in a disgusted manner. I ran into the living room to see him throwing my blanket on the floor. He couldn't even tell me what's wrong. He was just pointing and rubbing his hands on his pants.

 I looked on the couch where he was pointing, the same spot Becky's boyfriend was sitting the night before. Our TV remote and Playstation controllers were sitting there. As I got closer I saw them sitting on a white stain that was on the couch and it finally clicked what my boyfriend was freaking out about. He was beyond upset about this level of disrespect and immediately called his mom and best friends to help us move our shit out. We didn't even talk about it, he just made that decision. I didn't stop him though, I didn't want to be there anymore either.

I felt some guilt for just up and leaving without saying anything and leaving her with the apartment on her own but at the same time I felt so incredibly disrespected in what was supposed to be my house too. No to mention the huge favor we did for her by moving in there in the first place. We never did end up buying groceries or helping with the rent at all being we were there for less than 2 weeks.

 But I'm curious, AITA for leaving without saying anything and without paying a dime? I do feel guilty to this day but also still feel justified.

I was upset, considering that all the people throwing the party have known me for years, and should have at least remembered that my birthday is relatively close to the pastor’s daughters birthday, even if they don’t remember exactly what day it is.

Long story short, I didn’t end up going to the party and ended up having a small dinner with a cake with my family and the people that I consider my close friends. It was a good night. 

The next time I go to the church for our weekly service, all of a sudden one of the people who was being celebrated at the party came up to me, told me happy birthday, and told me “oh, so sorry we missed you on Friday (the day of the party). We had a good time, and we sang happy birthday and everything- oh, yeah, we put your name on the cake but you didn’t show up so…” he continued to say some other stuff, basically trying to guilt trip me for not showing up to the party they clearly hadn’t been throwing for me. 

I later had to have a meeting with my leaders (it’s a long story, my church has like a hierarchy system, it’s too complicated to explain, but all you need to know is that my leader is one of the  guys they had celebrated at the party and that his wife, who I will call “A” is also my leader, and that the pastors sons wife, “B”, was also in this meeting). B starts the meeting by telling me that she had no idea that it was my birthday on Friday and that she had originally only thrown the party for the pastors daughter and that they later added the two other people because they hadn’t gotten a chance to celebrated their birthdays in December and that when they found out it was my birthday that day she was like “oh my word” and that they added my name to the cake.

These past few months, I stopped going to Church. I am of the opinion that a relationship with God can transcend a mass, and that talking to him 1-on-1 via prayer is more impactful (aka going directly to the source). Lately, my Mom has been severely guilt tripping me about not going to Church. I tell her I love her, but then she fires back says that I ‘may “love” her, but I sure as heck don’t respect her.’ I think that is ridiculous, and I love and respect her so much. She is the most important person on this earth to me. However, me not going to Church has resulted in her having crying outbursts and giving me the side eye and just overall huffing around. 

Today, she has taken it a step further by stating that she is going to bill me a $10 charge for every Sunday I don’t go to mass, which I think is insane. She is going to do the same to my younger brothers too (who also haven’t been going to mass).

I’m starting to worry that I may be the a**hole because she is the one who is letting me graciously stay under her roof, rent free.

These past few months, I stopped going to Church. I am of the opinion that a relationship with God can transcend a mass, and that talking to him 1-on-1 via prayer is more impactful (aka going directly to the source). Lately, my Mom has been severely guilt tripping me about not going to Church. I tell her I love her, but then she fires back says that I ‘may “love” her, but I sure as heck don’t respect her.’ I think that is ridiculous, and I love and respect her so much. She is the most important person on this earth to me. However, me not going to Church has resulted in her having crying outbursts and giving me the side eye and just overall huffing around. 

Today, she has taken it a step further by stating that she is going to bill me a $10 charge for every Sunday I don’t go to mass, which I think is insane. She is going to do the same to my younger brothers too (who also haven’t been going to mass).

I’m starting to worry that I may be the a**hole because she is the one who is letting me graciously stay under her roof, rent free. At the same time, I am 23, and think I should be allowed to make my own decisions. Now I’m left wondering if AITA for not following her orders while she is housing me?
