0,1do5o6f,AITAH for tearing my family apart,"I (17N) am the youngest of three siblings (20M & 24F) and have been out as trans for 6 years. In this time my family has been very unexcepting due to their Christian beliefs and the fact that they ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt believe it is real‚Äù. 

I am turning 18 soon and have started the process of changing my legal name and have decided that I‚Äôm putting my foot down on using my deadname(or ‚ÄúGod givin name‚Äù according to my parents). I talked to my parents(50F & 55M) and after years of arguments they have finally agreed to use my preferred name(PN) once it‚Äôs been changed legally. They also advised me to tell my brother I was changing my name legally and ask him (again) to use my PN. 

My brother and I have never been close. Most of our childhoods he spent playing video games and watching YouTube (lots of Jordan Peterson). I would sometimes sit and watch him but not much bonding between us. We both grew up in church and he decided to become a devout Christian. 

The day comes where I get the opportunity to talk to him. We start talking. I casually start to inform that I‚Äôm changing my name legally and would like him to start using my PN. He (also calmly) says he can‚Äôt do something that would harm me and respects me to much to feed into my delusions. I still calmly tell him that if that is his decision then I‚Äôm probably going to start distancing myself from him. We go back and forth a couple times (still calmly) and I eventually excuse myself seeing that this conversation is going no where and that we‚Äôre both set in our decisions. I go to my room and start to cry and my brother goes to his room and also starts to cry. My mom eventually finds him crying and he explains what happened to her. She then comes to me and starts lecturing me for saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to distance myself‚Äù from my brother. She says I‚Äôm ‚Äútearing apart the family‚Äù ‚Äúwill end up alone‚Äù and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúa girl‚Äù. 

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. Ending up alone is one of my biggest fears and honestly loosing my family is something I‚Äôm super scared of to. But I feel like at this point unless I die or cut them out they won‚Äôt take me seriously. I don‚Äôt understand why my moms upset that my brothers actions have consequences. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs expected to just put up with constantly being deadnamed. Am I being unreasonable by distancing myself from my brother?

1,1dnyz2s,AITA for asking my dad for money? (UPDATE),"Because Reddit was a good outlet for me to vent last time, I figured an update would help me clarify my feelings and to just start looking forwards to the future.

Previously I (22F) asked Reddit if I was the asshole for asking my dad for money to pay for the remainder of my University costs due to the reaction of my family, primarily, my brother Jack (24M). Jack for the most part has acted coldly towards me these past few months, which surprised me because Jack's been known to be fairly reactionary when something's upset him. I figured this was Jack's way of trying to process his own feelings towards what I had done and I hadn't made any meaningful attempts to reconcile with him much to the chagrin of my Mum (50F). She thought that we were both being ridiculous, but that the burden of trying to repair the relationship was on me because I caused the mess in the first place.

I asked my Mum why it was any of Jack's business what my communication with my Dad (56M?) was about? And as Reddit kindly pointed out to me, I pointed out to her that her telling Jack that I had communicated with my Dad is what upset him in the first place. My Mum sternly told me that Jack had a right to know about any affairs concerning our Dad and that it was important that she let him know that she would always be on his side.

I don't know why, but after my Mum said that a pit in my stomach started forming and I asked if that meant she wouldn't always be on my side because I dared ask my Dad for help. My Mum got annoyed with me and said I was trying to ""twist her words"", clarifying that she would always side with Jack against our Dad. My Mum said that she was proud of me for not holding any resentment for my Dad and that it was definitely the reason I got the money from him in the first place. But according to her, my Dad is not the type of man who would give out money just like that, meaning he must have had a positive impression of me from the beginning if he gave it away all ""nilly willy"". And that Jack felt a certain type of way about it, which is why I needed to offer him my graces and try to reconcile with him.

The implications throughout the conversation left me very uncomfortable and I wasn't willing to continue asking questions I didn't want to know the answers to. For the next few weeks afterwards I just distanced myself completely from everyone around me. It just felt difficult talking to anyone knowing nobody was on my side. Jack started acting nicer towards me once he noticed how distant I'd become and has chosen not to acknowledge our previous argument, which I have taken full advantage of. I'm happy to not talk about it if it means keeping these last few months as peaceful as possible.

Thank you Reddit for offering your perspective to my situation. It's made me realise that I cannot control how other people react, but I can control how I react and I want to enter University as excited as possible, even if I can't share that excitement with my family.",UPDATE,2024-06-25,"AITA for asking my dad for money?

2,1dnvuto,AITA for accidentally outing my cousin? ,"Last week, me (22M) was talking to a friend (22M) who had recently been dumped by his girlfriend who ending up dating my cousin (24M) and I was laughing at what happened. During the conversation, I talked about how it was nice my cousin was getting back into dating after transitioning, but it sucks that it was with his ex. He was very confused and left a few minutes later. Apparently he did not know that my cousin was trans. I thought this was weird as he had worked with my cousin for 2 years at a restaurant and had often hung out.

For context, my cousin had documented his entire transition (FTM) on his Instagram where he posted many updates on testosterone. He had even posted a picture of his chest post top surgery. I thought that my friend had seen these posts and did not know that he didn‚Äôt. This Instagram was public so anybody could look up my cousins name and find it. 

A few days later I get a call from my cousin yelling at me for outing him. Without me knowing, my friend had told a lot of other people that my cousin was trans and some of his homofobic friends were harassing my cousin.

3,1dnu3yy,AITA for requiring my roommate to start paying for the wifi because she makes us turn it off at night?,"I (28f) am getting tired of having to turn off the Wi-Fi at night for my roommate (24f) who says she‚Äôs concerned about 5G and EMFs.

My roommate is already very much organic style hippie. Is against using harsh chemicals for cleaning and is very unaware of the sticky messes she leaves behind. I understand that I need to communicate better and tell her these things bother me, but I feel like it‚Äôs best to pick and choose my battles.

The thing that has become very bothersome to me is that she now requires to turn off the Wi-Fi at night because she‚Äôs worried about EMF and 5G. In my head that‚Äôs more of a her problem than a me problem. I also pay for the utilities because I‚Äôm aware of our financial differences, and I have never requested that she pays me for any of it.

At night when the Wi-Fi goes off, I have to use my hotspot. I‚Äôve now run out of my own data for hotspot on multiple occasions and it charges me extra when I go over. So now I‚Äôm paying for both Wi-Fi and extra data so I can continue to use the Internet after she goes to bed.

We also agreed that I turn off the Wi-Fi before I go to bed since I go to sleep later than she does and she will turn it back on when she wakes up because she wakes up before I do.

Most of the time when it‚Äôs late at night, I just feel tired and I don‚Äôt want to have to walk out of my bedroom into the living room and turn off the Wi-Fi. So I got in the habit of turning it off while I was still more awake but having to rely on my hotspot. I understand that must be champagne problems that I have to go click a button, but I find it quite annoying and irritating. I used to use my Alexa as my alarm clock, but she won‚Äôt work unless she‚Äôs connected to Wi-Fi. If you know how to make Alexa work for the alarm without wifi let me know!

I have even discussed moving the router to a different area of the apartment, so it‚Äôs further away from her room, but she still says no she wants it off at night. I even offered buying her some sort of EMF blocker that I found online to help her concerns but again she says no. I am becoming annoyed and frustrated because I feel like it‚Äôs more of an inconvenience and if she doesn‚Äôt turn the Wi-Fi on in the morning when I have meetings right away then I have to wait for it to load up and I‚Äôm stressed. Again, I understand I can wake up a little bit earlier and turn it back on, but it‚Äôs just so annoying to have to click a button when it could just stay on.

I have decided she must start paying for the Wi-Fi since I am having to overuse my data. I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm retaliating, in a sense I guess I am, I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable paying more than I should be for something that shouldn‚Äôt be occurring in my mind.

I of course have tried my best to make her feel heard, but I feel like this is just a matter of wearing a foil hat, even if we turn off our Wi-Fi how do we not get exposed to the EMF from the surrounding apartments from our left right and below us?

5,1dntxdx,AITA for being distant from friends over their daughters name?,"I (35F) Ann am longtime friends with a married couple (40M) land (42F). I've been distant since the pandemic when their daughter was born, and they just confronted me about it about an hour ago. 

I started distancing when the husband started judging me for not making my marriage work. There were extreme reasons I left that I never really broadcast for my children's sake. Some was very public which I addressed, but the rest I've kept quiet.

But the most recent issue, is that I lost a child when I was 18. She was born alive but survived only a few hours. I chose a name for her, that I confided in them, that was very special to me, a play on family names, but appropriate for a very unexpected and traumatic loss. 

They used the name for their daughter. I would have had no issue with this, but I found out in the Facebook announcement. Which brought back some very painful and traumatic memories. I didn't say anything, I don't own the name, but I felt very disrespected that they chose not to even give me a heads up, especially as many in our friend circle know where they got it and I was put on the spot as far as my reaction. 

So I just distanced myself from them. Well, about an hour ago I got a message from him that was very angrily worded. Apparently he had been talking to a mutual friend about me and how I've shown no interest in their daughter, and he mentioned that them using the name without a heads up was very painful for me, and that it had put me on the spot because a lot of people had been asking for my reaction. 

He called me selfish and an AH for trying to ""sully their joy with my pain"" and ""making everything about me"" and that I ""should just get over it, she passed years ago"". 

IMO losing a child is something you never truly get over, and I was never rude, I never spoke badly of them or to them, I won't talk about it with anyone. I've just chosen to protect myself and remain distant. I wanted them to enjoy their daughter, they struggled with infertility for years and I am happy for them, it's just painful for me and I felt very disrespected with how they handled it.

I (17f) have a relatively large family who are close to each other. My maternal grandparents' 3 children and their families all live within 20 minute drive of each other and the cousins hang out regularly.

My parents have me and my sister Lily (16f), both adopted. Lily is drop dead gorgeous. Our culture has a certain beauty standard and Lily just knocks them all out of the park. Personally, I have never seen a more attractive person than Lily in real life. She also has a nice fashion style. In all, she just looks amazing all the time.

Our female cousins look up to Lily when it comes to looks. They would try to copy her hair and dressing style. Most of the time it did not work because of the differences in builds, skin color, and facial structure. I am not fashionable and don't really care much what I'm wearing but I am often roped into providing comments about my cousins' clothes and looks.

A few days ago, my cousin Jen (17f) asked for my opinion about her new dress. I told her it was not the best matched for her. Jen grumbled that she saw Lily wearing something similar and she looked great. I told Jen she should try to find something that is her own style, as Lily looks very different from her and what looks good on Lily won't necessarily look good on her. Jen took this as me calling her ugly, told her mom, who berated me through my mom that I was insensitive and unkind.

I did not think nor say that Jen was ugly. I simply told her just because the dress looked good on Lily didn't mean it was best fit for her and maybe she should look for something else.

10,1dntgqm,AITA if I ask to get my part of the engagement present? ,"All right, so here's the story:

My (27M) ex-fianc√©e (26F) comes from a culture where it's a custom to throw a huge party when you get engaged. Basically a mini-wedding. 

So now here's the thing, we are from two different countries, and my ex's family is really spread out all over her country, so we needed to figure out accommodation for all the people coming from many different places. 

Another important thing is, my ex's family happens to be really wealthy and own a boutique hotel in a beach resort town in her country, so she offered to accommodate the guests there. There was enough guests coming so that they needed to close the hotel for 3 days for ""regular"" customers. She explicitly refused to accept any sort of money from me for letting the guests stay there. All other costs except the hotel we split 50/50. 

As a present for the two of us, my friends, instead of getting us something material, all chipped in some money and gifted us an envelope with cash to supply our ""travel fund"". As be both had a lot going on in our lives, we ended up not using the money. 

About half a year ago my ex broke off the engagement (no bad blood, no huge fight, she apparently ""lost feelings""). Until then I managed to completely forget about the money my  friends gifted us. 

Yesterday I remembered about it and reached out to my ex asking what should we do about it (my idea was giving it back to my friends as it sort of felt wrong to keep it). 
To my surprise, she not only remembered about the money, she also thought about it, and one-sidedly decided that she deserves to keep all of it, because she provided accommodation to the guests and she's entitled to the money to cover her losses for the hotel being closed. What's more, she berated me for my ""poor mentality"", and was really offended with the question (I didn't even ask to get the money back yet, I just asked what we should do about it)

I would normally not have a problem about compensating her for the accommodation, but she refused my offers when we were organizing the party. Hell, I'd even let her have the gifted cash if she asked for it and discussed it with me, but her just claiming the money without saying a word really tickled me the wrong way, especially considering the fact this was a gift from my friends and not our common savings or something, so now I'm considering to demand she at least returns half of it. (We're not talking about life-changing sums of money here btw, my friends and I all come from a middle-class background)

She would come back, say something along the lines of ‚ÄúI don't feel like going anymore, we can do it some other day.‚Äù So we just made our own plans, deciding that if she couldn't go, we would head to a closer mall on our own.   
  
Once she came back, she said no one could take her until it cooled down (in my area, it starts getting colder around 5-6). This was around 11:30, and we had already been on facetime for a few hours waiting for her. We didnt want to go that late, so we said we had things to do. Note: Even if we went, its not enjoyable talking to her. She never stops talking about her boyfriend or how ‚ÄòLatina baddie‚Äô she thinks she is. (She's Hispanic but is paper white.)   
We went to the mall without her. After a while of having fun and eating, we were walking and saw her around 2:30-3PM (Keep in mind, she told us she couldn't go to the other mall until around 5-6.)  
  
 When we saw her, we hid in another store until our ride came to pick us up. About an hour later, we invited her over to the pool to talk and apologize- even though in my opinion, we didnt do anything. She came fully clothed with her sister (whos known for fighting people.) After our talk, we thought everything was fine.

Me and the other friend had plans to stay at a hotel together that weekend, completely unrelated to her. We had already stayed at the hotel the last weekend, and didn't tell her. We knew she would get mad for some reason. Towards the end of our stay, I decided to post a nice picture of us together. 

Not very long after I posted it, I kept getting dms from my friends, sending me screenshots of her close friends. For some reason, that single post of me and the other friend set her off. She went on a rampage, calling us fake bitches and telling everyone on her Close Friends our personal drama with the mall.   
She blocked us on everything, and ignored us for 9 hours at a pool party with our other friends. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-25,"AITA for going to the mall without my friend of 3 years?

I told my girlfriend about it and she thinks I'm a thief for stealing those points. I tried to explain to her that it's not anyone's real phone number. She says that I didn't set up the account so I'm the bad guy.

I've already come to the realization that I ""at 21 years old"" am simply not built for the ""taking care of the household"" or ""housewife"" life style i prefer to live on my own that's why i can't wait to go back to college. The idea of picking up after people infuriates me, i hate folding laundry for grown folk, i hate cleaning the counter every 2 seconds because they were sloppy in fixing their food, Hate making up the bed for others, hate doing others dishes, hate cleaning the stove after someone cooked for for THEMSELEVS and left grease splatter everywhere. whew that was long winded i'll try to be as concise as possible. I'm a black girl with traditional parents who are christian (don't know if that's relevant but oh well) who believe in the chain of command, and hierarchy, obedience, etc etc so as the child i'm suppose to serve obey and do things for them without complaint. My mom has beaten (literally) and instilled in me cleanliness for years but as of recently i've been sick the bs specifically the HYPOCRISY of it all. She has told me all my life ""if you see a dish in the sink and it's the only in there clean it that's petty to leave it in there"" but her and my father proceed to do the same thing. They go on midnight munchings and put all types of dishes in the sink and i wake up kitchen filthy and sometimes I get yelled for it. Insane. She would fry some fish and leave the pan filled with oil on the stove and the stove would be filthy and get mad at me hooting & cussing because i hadn't cleaned the stove. Mind you this is the same women who constantly says ""i can't stand a dirty kitchen"" & ""clean up after you cook it's not that hard!"" seems like the standards are different when it comes to her. i get it i get it she's my mom i am the daughter just shut up and do it right? But i can't seem to wrap my brain around that shit, walk what you talk, practice what you preach no? And she goes on these weekly rants which are sometimes valid about her being alone and not getting help from me and my dad but cut it out she's only talking to me my dad isn't expected to do anything she's really not gonna have any assistance at all when i go back to collge or move out officially, his only job is take out the trash and clean shower after he uses it and he bitches and moans about that. Back to the topic at hand am i being unreasonable??

16,1dnsqbl,AITA for not driving my friends to each of their houses?,"I am 17 and have recently passed my driving test and got a car.

 I am the only one that can drive in my friend group and I‚Äôm beginning to find it a bit annoying because I live quite far away from my other friends. I don‚Äôt mind picking them up from the closest person to me which is 11 minutes away when the other three are around 20 minutes away and then they‚Äôre around 5/10 minutes away from each other. 

My issue is that we have been going to the beach which is 20 minutes away from my house in the complete opposite direction of all my friends. I think I‚Äôm being kind picking them up from the closest friends because it still means I have to do an extra 20 minute drive but they seem to want me to go all the way to their houses. All in all it would take me over 1 hour to get home. 

Tonight I dropped them off at one of the houses that‚Äôs 20 minutes away and told the other two to make their own way home even though it‚Äôs only a 10 minute drive. They have access to a bus. 

Then, when they got home they texted me on our groupchat and complained that I didn‚Äôt take them home. When we went out last night everyone was home by 12 and I didn‚Äôt get home until around 1am. We had a big argument about it today and they still think they‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve told them that I‚Äôm never picking them up from their houses again and I‚Äôll only pick up/drop off at my closest friend‚Äôs house. 

I asked for ¬£2.50 each for petrol but I don‚Äôt think this is enough for all the miles I used but I feel bad asking for more because I am their friend and I‚Äôm doing them a favour but I don‚Äôt have any money myself at the moment and I have to get to work and college. 

I think I am being a pushover and that they‚Äôre in the wrong for expecting me to pick them up and drop them off when they can get a bus (granted it takes them longer) but they aren‚Äôt thinking about me and the fact that I don‚Äôt exactly want to be their personal uber.
