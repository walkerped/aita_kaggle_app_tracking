0,1do5o6f,AITAH for tearing my family apart,"I (17N) am the youngest of three siblings (20M & 24F) and have been out as trans for 6 years. In this time my family has been very unexcepting due to their Christian beliefs and the fact that they ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt believe it is real‚Äù. 

I am turning 18 soon and have started the process of changing my legal name and have decided that I‚Äôm putting my foot down on using my deadname(or ‚ÄúGod givin name‚Äù according to my parents). I talked to my parents(50F & 55M) and after years of arguments they have finally agreed to use my preferred name(PN) once it‚Äôs been changed legally. They also advised me to tell my brother I was changing my name legally and ask him (again) to use my PN. 

My brother and I have never been close. Most of our childhoods he spent playing video games and watching YouTube (lots of Jordan Peterson). I would sometimes sit and watch him but not much bonding between us. We both grew up in church and he decided to become a devout Christian. 

The day comes where I get the opportunity to talk to him. We start talking. I casually start to inform that I‚Äôm changing my name legally and would like him to start using my PN. He (also calmly) says he can‚Äôt do something that would harm me and respects me to much to feed into my delusions. I still calmly tell him that if that is his decision then I‚Äôm probably going to start distancing myself from him. We go back and forth a couple times (still calmly) and I eventually excuse myself seeing that this conversation is going no where and that we‚Äôre both set in our decisions. I go to my room and start to cry and my brother goes to his room and also starts to cry. My mom eventually finds him crying and he explains what happened to her. She then comes to me and starts lecturing me for saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to distance myself‚Äù from my brother. She says I‚Äôm ‚Äútearing apart the family‚Äù ‚Äúwill end up alone‚Äù and that I‚Äôm ‚Äúa girl‚Äù. 

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. Ending up alone is one of my biggest fears and honestly loosing my family is something I‚Äôm super scared of to. But I feel like at this point unless I die or cut them out they won‚Äôt take me seriously. I don‚Äôt understand why my moms upset that my brothers actions have consequences. I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs expected to just put up with constantly being deadnamed. Am I being unreasonable by distancing myself from my brother?

1,1dnyz2s,AITA for asking my dad for money? (UPDATE),"Because Reddit was a good outlet for me to vent last time, I figured an update would help me clarify my feelings and to just start looking forwards to the future.

Previously I (22F) asked Reddit if I was the asshole for asking my dad for money to pay for the remainder of my University costs due to the reaction of my family, primarily, my brother Jack (24M). Jack for the most part has acted coldly towards me these past few months, which surprised me because Jack's been known to be fairly reactionary when something's upset him. I figured this was Jack's way of trying to process his own feelings towards what I had done and I hadn't made any meaningful attempts to reconcile with him much to the chagrin of my Mum (50F). She thought that we were both being ridiculous, but that the burden of trying to repair the relationship was on me because I caused the mess in the first place.

I asked my Mum why it was any of Jack's business what my communication with my Dad (56M?) was about? And as Reddit kindly pointed out to me, I pointed out to her that her telling Jack that I had communicated with my Dad is what upset him in the first place. My Mum sternly told me that Jack had a right to know about any affairs concerning our Dad and that it was important that she let him know that she would always be on his side.

I don't know why, but after my Mum said that a pit in my stomach started forming and I asked if that meant she wouldn't always be on my side because I dared ask my Dad for help. My Mum got annoyed with me and said I was trying to ""twist her words"", clarifying that she would always side with Jack against our Dad. My Mum said that she was proud of me for not holding any resentment for my Dad and that it was definitely the reason I got the money from him in the first place. But according to her, my Dad is not the type of man who would give out money just like that, meaning he must have had a positive impression of me from the beginning if he gave it away all ""nilly willy"". And that Jack felt a certain type of way about it, which is why I needed to offer him my graces and try to reconcile with him.

The implications throughout the conversation left me very uncomfortable and I wasn't willing to continue asking questions I didn't want to know the answers to. For the next few weeks afterwards I just distanced myself completely from everyone around me. It just felt difficult talking to anyone knowing nobody was on my side. Jack started acting nicer towards me once he noticed how distant I'd become and has chosen not to acknowledge our previous argument, which I have taken full advantage of. I'm happy to not talk about it if it means keeping these last few months as peaceful as possible.

Thank you Reddit for offering your perspective to my situation. It's made me realise that I cannot control how other people react, but I can control how I react and I want to enter University as excited as possible, even if I can't share that excitement with my family.",UPDATE,2024-06-25,"AITA for asking my dad for money?

2,1dnvuto,AITA for accidentally outing my cousin? ,"Last week, me (22M) was talking to a friend (22M) who had recently been dumped by his girlfriend who ending up dating my cousin (24M) and I was laughing at what happened. During the conversation, I talked about how it was nice my cousin was getting back into dating after transitioning, but it sucks that it was with his ex. He was very confused and left a few minutes later. Apparently he did not know that my cousin was trans. I thought this was weird as he had worked with my cousin for 2 years at a restaurant and had often hung out.

For context, my cousin had documented his entire transition (FTM) on his Instagram where he posted many updates on testosterone. He had even posted a picture of his chest post top surgery. I thought that my friend had seen these posts and did not know that he didn‚Äôt. This Instagram was public so anybody could look up my cousins name and find it. 

A few days later I get a call from my cousin yelling at me for outing him. Without me knowing, my friend had told a lot of other people that my cousin was trans and some of his homofobic friends were harassing my cousin.

3,1dnu3yy,AITA for requiring my roommate to start paying for the wifi because she makes us turn it off at night?,"I (28f) am getting tired of having to turn off the Wi-Fi at night for my roommate (24f) who says she‚Äôs concerned about 5G and EMFs.

My roommate is already very much organic style hippie. Is against using harsh chemicals for cleaning and is very unaware of the sticky messes she leaves behind. I understand that I need to communicate better and tell her these things bother me, but I feel like it‚Äôs best to pick and choose my battles.

The thing that has become very bothersome to me is that she now requires to turn off the Wi-Fi at night because she‚Äôs worried about EMF and 5G. In my head that‚Äôs more of a her problem than a me problem. I also pay for the utilities because I‚Äôm aware of our financial differences, and I have never requested that she pays me for any of it.

At night when the Wi-Fi goes off, I have to use my hotspot. I‚Äôve now run out of my own data for hotspot on multiple occasions and it charges me extra when I go over. So now I‚Äôm paying for both Wi-Fi and extra data so I can continue to use the Internet after she goes to bed.

We also agreed that I turn off the Wi-Fi before I go to bed since I go to sleep later than she does and she will turn it back on when she wakes up because she wakes up before I do.

Most of the time when it‚Äôs late at night, I just feel tired and I don‚Äôt want to have to walk out of my bedroom into the living room and turn off the Wi-Fi. So I got in the habit of turning it off while I was still more awake but having to rely on my hotspot. I understand that must be champagne problems that I have to go click a button, but I find it quite annoying and irritating. I used to use my Alexa as my alarm clock, but she won‚Äôt work unless she‚Äôs connected to Wi-Fi. If you know how to make Alexa work for the alarm without wifi let me know!

I have even discussed moving the router to a different area of the apartment, so it‚Äôs further away from her room, but she still says no she wants it off at night. I even offered buying her some sort of EMF blocker that I found online to help her concerns but again she says no. I am becoming annoyed and frustrated because I feel like it‚Äôs more of an inconvenience and if she doesn‚Äôt turn the Wi-Fi on in the morning when I have meetings right away then I have to wait for it to load up and I‚Äôm stressed. Again, I understand I can wake up a little bit earlier and turn it back on, but it‚Äôs just so annoying to have to click a button when it could just stay on.

I have decided she must start paying for the Wi-Fi since I am having to overuse my data. I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôll think I‚Äôm retaliating, in a sense I guess I am, I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable paying more than I should be for something that shouldn‚Äôt be occurring in my mind.

I of course have tried my best to make her feel heard, but I feel like this is just a matter of wearing a foil hat, even if we turn off our Wi-Fi how do we not get exposed to the EMF from the surrounding apartments from our left right and below us?

5,1dntxdx,AITA for being distant from friends over their daughters name?,"I (35F) Ann am longtime friends with a married couple (40M) land (42F). I've been distant since the pandemic when their daughter was born, and they just confronted me about it about an hour ago. 

I started distancing when the husband started judging me for not making my marriage work. There were extreme reasons I left that I never really broadcast for my children's sake. Some was very public which I addressed, but the rest I've kept quiet.

But the most recent issue, is that I lost a child when I was 18. She was born alive but survived only a few hours. I chose a name for her, that I confided in them, that was very special to me, a play on family names, but appropriate for a very unexpected and traumatic loss. 

They used the name for their daughter. I would have had no issue with this, but I found out in the Facebook announcement. Which brought back some very painful and traumatic memories. I didn't say anything, I don't own the name, but I felt very disrespected that they chose not to even give me a heads up, especially as many in our friend circle know where they got it and I was put on the spot as far as my reaction. 

So I just distanced myself from them. Well, about an hour ago I got a message from him that was very angrily worded. Apparently he had been talking to a mutual friend about me and how I've shown no interest in their daughter, and he mentioned that them using the name without a heads up was very painful for me, and that it had put me on the spot because a lot of people had been asking for my reaction. 

He called me selfish and an AH for trying to ""sully their joy with my pain"" and ""making everything about me"" and that I ""should just get over it, she passed years ago"". 

IMO losing a child is something you never truly get over, and I was never rude, I never spoke badly of them or to them, I won't talk about it with anyone. I've just chosen to protect myself and remain distant. I wanted them to enjoy their daughter, they struggled with infertility for years and I am happy for them, it's just painful for me and I felt very disrespected with how they handled it.

I (17f) have a relatively large family who are close to each other. My maternal grandparents' 3 children and their families all live within 20 minute drive of each other and the cousins hang out regularly.

My parents have me and my sister Lily (16f), both adopted. Lily is drop dead gorgeous. Our culture has a certain beauty standard and Lily just knocks them all out of the park. Personally, I have never seen a more attractive person than Lily in real life. She also has a nice fashion style. In all, she just looks amazing all the time.

Our female cousins look up to Lily when it comes to looks. They would try to copy her hair and dressing style. Most of the time it did not work because of the differences in builds, skin color, and facial structure. I am not fashionable and don't really care much what I'm wearing but I am often roped into providing comments about my cousins' clothes and looks.

A few days ago, my cousin Jen (17f) asked for my opinion about her new dress. I told her it was not the best matched for her. Jen grumbled that she saw Lily wearing something similar and she looked great. I told Jen she should try to find something that is her own style, as Lily looks very different from her and what looks good on Lily won't necessarily look good on her. Jen took this as me calling her ugly, told her mom, who berated me through my mom that I was insensitive and unkind.

I did not think nor say that Jen was ugly. I simply told her just because the dress looked good on Lily didn't mean it was best fit for her and maybe she should look for something else.

10,1dntgqm,AITA if I ask to get my part of the engagement present? ,"All right, so here's the story:

My (27M) ex-fianc√©e (26F) comes from a culture where it's a custom to throw a huge party when you get engaged. Basically a mini-wedding. 

So now here's the thing, we are from two different countries, and my ex's family is really spread out all over her country, so we needed to figure out accommodation for all the people coming from many different places. 

Another important thing is, my ex's family happens to be really wealthy and own a boutique hotel in a beach resort town in her country, so she offered to accommodate the guests there. There was enough guests coming so that they needed to close the hotel for 3 days for ""regular"" customers. She explicitly refused to accept any sort of money from me for letting the guests stay there. All other costs except the hotel we split 50/50. 

As a present for the two of us, my friends, instead of getting us something material, all chipped in some money and gifted us an envelope with cash to supply our ""travel fund"". As be both had a lot going on in our lives, we ended up not using the money. 

About half a year ago my ex broke off the engagement (no bad blood, no huge fight, she apparently ""lost feelings""). Until then I managed to completely forget about the money my  friends gifted us. 

Yesterday I remembered about it and reached out to my ex asking what should we do about it (my idea was giving it back to my friends as it sort of felt wrong to keep it). 
To my surprise, she not only remembered about the money, she also thought about it, and one-sidedly decided that she deserves to keep all of it, because she provided accommodation to the guests and she's entitled to the money to cover her losses for the hotel being closed. What's more, she berated me for my ""poor mentality"", and was really offended with the question (I didn't even ask to get the money back yet, I just asked what we should do about it)

I would normally not have a problem about compensating her for the accommodation, but she refused my offers when we were organizing the party. Hell, I'd even let her have the gifted cash if she asked for it and discussed it with me, but her just claiming the money without saying a word really tickled me the wrong way, especially considering the fact this was a gift from my friends and not our common savings or something, so now I'm considering to demand she at least returns half of it. (We're not talking about life-changing sums of money here btw, my friends and I all come from a middle-class background)

As we were talking before she moved in, she described how she‚Äôs very chill person that doesn‚Äôt do much besides going to work and keeping to herself in her room. I immediately picked her since that‚Äôs how my old roommate and I operated and wanted someone like that.

Since then, it has been nothing but lies. Since she has moved in, I have gotten a noise complaint, and a violation from our property management company due to marijuana (She left her bong right in the living room). Not to mention, she has people in and out of the apartment every single day. Ranging from 1-12 people without even telling me. OH and the worst part is having loud sex with her boyfriend that basically now lives with us, when are rooms are right next to each other. 

This has only been one month since she has moved in, and since then, i accepted that this was going to be a shit year in this apartment. 

Now, I recently found out she hadn‚Äôt been approved yet by our pmc, but was living in with me under a. roommate agreement. Since than I took the opportunity to explain to my pmc what she has done while living here. 

This morning, she woke up to an email stating her application has been denied, and must immediately vacate. She found out I spoke to the property people, even though I tried to set boundaries with her multiple times and always half assed them and never listened to me. She now has nowhere to go and is extremely upset with me, I told her I didn‚Äôt wanna risk getting evicted due to everything that has already happened while she has moved in for the month and I won‚Äôt allow her to come back.

As we were talking before she moved in, she described how she‚Äôs very chill person that doesn‚Äôt do much besides going to work and keeping to herself in her room. I immediately picked her since that‚Äôs how my old roommate and I operated and wanted someone like that.

Since then, it has been nothing but lies. Since she has moved in, I have gotten a noise complaint, and a violation from our property management company due to marijuana (She left her bong right in the living room). Not to mention, she has people in and out of the apartment every single day. Ranging from 1-12 people without even telling me. OH and the worst part is having loud sex with her boyfriend that basically now lives with us, when are rooms are right next to each other. 

This has only been one month since she has moved in, and since then, i accepted that this was going to be a shit year in this apartment. 

Now, I recently found out she hadn‚Äôt been approved yet by our pmc, but was living in with me under a. roommate agreement. Since than I took the opportunity to explain to my pmc what she has done while living here. 

This morning, she woke up to an email stating her application has been denied, and must immediately vacate. She found out I spoke to the property people, even though I tried to set boundaries with her multiple times and always half assed them and never listened to me. She now has nowhere to go and is extremely upset with me, I told her I didn‚Äôt wanna risk getting evicted due to everything that has already happened while she has moved in for the month and I won‚Äôt allow her to come back.

 I may ne the youngest but I always have to plan for the best and the worst as my sibling like to live day by day or just slack on thier lives. My dad age 51 have a drinking problem and I tend to avoid him as much as possible. For father's day we planned a whole get together for him just to show up 4 hours late and drunk out of his mind. He clearly looks unwell as he is missing teeth, swollen belly, malnourished etc. 
Trust me we have tried everything with him but he just refuses to stay sober. Fast forward I had a discussion with my siblings letting them know he is on the verge of not being here for Long as doctors say his liver is working at less than 50%. 
I suggested we start paying for funeral services as I don't want to have to fundraise and make the process longer. They just said to stop thinking negative and when the day comes it comes. 

I've already grieved my dad or the man he was because I really don't recognize who this man is now. Funerals are expensive and financially none of us are stable enough to pay for a funeral.

22,1dok38w,WIBTA for creating and distributing a resume for my boyfriend?,"Boyfriend and I have been living together for over a year. Late last year I lost my job and took 4 months to secure a new full time job. Less than a month after that, he lost/quit his. I don't blame him for it, the job was a different kind of horrible.   
  
It has now been maybe 5 months since then? 

I need him to get a job. I work remote, he used to have at least a few projects and work remote most days too. We talked about this last month, I opened up that I couldn't handle it anymore, I needed him to start helping me out. He hasn't done anything remotely work or job hunting related in maybe 3 months. He hasnt even opened social media since March.

We talked about him starting to look for work, and he agreed, he understood, and he said he would work on it. I told him that I needed him to have something by july. Because seriously, it was taking a toll on me. It's Almost July and nothing!   
  
I've been asking since start of June if I could have a copy of his resume so I could modify and update it, because between the two of us I'm better at it by a long shot, and it was our dynamic for me to proofread or improve a lot of text bodies he needed to work on that's in English. He kept saying not now for a couple weeks whenever I asked until last week he told me when I asked again that he would do it himself and he had a plan. What PLAN? He doesn't even share anything with me about any plans, and I know he sure as heck isn't doing anything except think and think while gaming and think while watching. 

Don't get me wrong, both our mental healths are complicated and I know what he's going through, I'm trying so hard to be understanding and careful and everything while still drawing my own lines. This is one of them that's getting toed.

Now, my mother has a lot of clients in her business, and when I asked briefly if she knew anyone looking for a graphic/product designer/multimedia artist/what-have-you, she said I could send her my boyfriend's resume and she would give it to anyone that needed a worker. 

I also have a couple other well connected relatives who have said the same. Just send the portfolio and resume and they'd share it. He was even directly offered a job at my uncle-in-law's company and offered to match his last paycheck but he declined it, which I understand because the familial ties is a lot of pressure to put on someone. But I'm mostly only sharing that to make my point.

Now. I know his work history. I am good at writing. WIBTA if I sent his resume to prospective work that falls within the lines of his profession? If I ever get anything back from anyone, I'd be like ""so... I did this"" and he can decide on his own whether or not he wants it. But I am just soooo sick of his lack of movement. We have a schedule for counseling for the first time next week. I am so looking forward to it. I'm sick of this situation.

TLDR I wanna distribute my bfs resume that i made to people I know personally. He hasn't had a job in months and doesnt seem to be making any effort.

23,1dok1hh,AITAH for preventing my dad from getting married?,"Hi, 

This is quite a complex case so I‚Äôll try to make it is simple as I possibly can. My mom passed away and my dad has, since then, been in what is called ‚Äúundivided estate‚Äù. This means, that my mom‚Äôs inheritance for us is bound in their shared house and my dad can use that money as he wishes (within fair limits). This is permitted by law in my country. 

My dad has now found a new girlfriend he wishes to marry. We (me 31, my brothers 34, 23 and 23 ) are all happy for him to get married and we really like his girlfriend so we were excited about the news. However, we also knew that my dad cannot legally re-marry if the estate has not been divided *or* he has made some sort of other agreement with us. 
We waited for him to make a decision on what he would like to happen with the inheritance. For unknown reasons my dad, although proposing to his girlfriend a year ago, just now decided to write a message to us on what he wants to happen.  This is under two months before the wedding. In short, he writes that it is almost time for him to get married so it is now time for us to give up our mom‚Äôs inheritance so he can get married without dividing the estate and giving us our inheritance. In the same message he mentions that he will make sure to put aside the value of the inheritance in his testament so we can get it when he passes away. This would lead to more money on the long run. 

We are not opposed to an agreement, but he never once sat us down to talk to us about what we would like to do and whether we would like to give up our right to our mom‚Äôs inheritance or not. He made the decision and dropped it on us two months before his wedding, giving us almost no time to seek legal counsel or thinking the decision through.

But my brothers and I contact a lawyer very quickly to talk about what the best decision would be. The lawyer mentions, that in order for this to be a fair deal, we would need to make conditions and also of course see the testament in which the agreement has been written and approved. 

We let our dad know the day after he sent us the proposition that it might work, but we will have to sit down with a lawyer as a family and look over the testament to make sure all parts are making an informed decision. 
My dad responds, that he does not have the time to complete his testament before the wedding. But we insist that at the very least we need to see the document where this deal is written before we give him complete control  over our mom‚Äôs inheritance for us. 
He replies: ‚Äúwell I do not have the money to divide the estate and give you the inheritance right now. I guess I can sell the house and take a loan if that is what you want me to do - a house I‚Äôve slaved away for years to buy. I‚Äôm and honest man always have been but I can see that my own kids doesn‚Äôt trust me. I guess I‚Äôll call off the wedding because I can‚Äôt afford to get married now‚Äù

24,1dojsrx,AITA for telling my friends to shut the fuck up ,"I have two friends let's call them Mark and Derek. They're both in their 30s as am I and they live around the corner from me. 

Over the past two years I would say, they have been having people around on Friday or Saturday nights and being super loud. Loud enough that if I have a window open or on the latch I can hear them from around the corner (I dread to think what their neighbours think of them). Not every weekend, but enough where it was becoming an issue. It's been brought up to them on WhatsApp and in person a number of times, usually after the fact and they apologise sometimes, other times they just make jokes about it. I've brought it up in jokey ways and in matter of fact ways and it never stopped. If it's not warm, I will just shut the window and put a fan on instead (I like a breeze while I'm trying to sleep).

However a few weeks ago, I was asleep and got woken up by Derek kind of shrieking/laughing at 1am.   They were being so loud I could hear conversation clearly and I was really peed off about being woken up. I messaged into a group chat we have with a couple of other friends and said ""Can you guys shut the fuck up, every weekend now I have to shut my windows just to be able to sleep because of how loud you are, it's a pisstake"". 

I'm aware I could have said it nicer or not swore but they've been told numerous times before and not stopped. After they saw the message they did quiet down and I haven't heard anything from them since. They are also not talking to me now, a mutual friend told me that they were annoyed with me and that I could have just said something instead of getting angry like that. 

Obviously I'm biased towards myself and don't understand how they don't consider me telling them numerous times through out the year as 'saying something' but our friendship group is split with 2 others clearly on my side and 1 friend stuck in the middle.

He never looks put together, grew his hair out long, nicks on his face from shaving badly. Every time we have a get-together he gets trashed and passes out somewhere.

Last week when he was over I finally told him that his life's a mess, and honestly I'm ashamed because he's so much better than this. I told him life is not going to stop just because of this personal tragedy, and that it has been three years already and at some point he has to get it together.

He said I didn't get it, I don't know what it's like to lose a child.

We lived right next door to each other and were more like sisters then aunt and niece. We had a huge fallout 5 years ago where she was spreading family gossip about me and I brushed it off. We have always been very close but I am a very private person who does not share much about my everyday details. Not on purpose or anything, just don‚Äôt think to be very open. She is the exact opposite, she shares every detail about her life from her tinder dates, family drama, and personal feelings. 

I found out my aunt was shit talking me and I confronted her about it wanting to know why she would do that. And she went on this rage rant about how I‚Äôm so private and don‚Äôt share details about my life and making up scenarios about why I don‚Äôt open up to her and I said it‚Äôs uncomfortable for me to open up and nothing personal. She went off saying how I think she‚Äôs jealous of me for going to law school and that I‚Äôm a whore for having a boyfriend. Like what??? And she said she didn‚Äôt wanna be friends with me. 

So I took what she wanted and stopped being friends with her. A few months ago my boyfriend proposed to me and I announced to my family we‚Äôd be having an engagement party and my aunt lost her shit saying how dare I keep something so important from her and I literally told her that SHE was the one who wanted to end out friendship and I don‚Äôt owe her any personal details about my life.

29,1dojaul,AITA for apologizing to a patient in my native language?,"Hi everyone, 

I work as a receptionist at a dental clinic in Germany, and I am originally from Romania. Recently, I had to translate for a patient who didn't speak German. My boss, the dentist, was treating this patient and I was translating. 

On that particular day, my boss was very stressed and ended up being quite rushed and unfriendly to the patient. After the appointment, I apologized to the patient in Romanian, explaining that the dentist was having a bad day and was stressed. 

My German boss, who DOESN'T speak Romanian, misinterpreted my body language and what I said as criticism against her. She thought I was badmouthing her in front of the patient, even though she doesn't even understand Romanian. Apparently, she picked up a few words and misunderstood them.

This led to a heated discussion between her and me, and she was very angry and rude towards me. I was just trying to make the patient feel bettered and explain the situation, but now I'm wondering if I overstepped my bounds.

A few months ago, March I think, Heather started to become friends with Lou. This was extremely out of place for her as we all really disliked him. I personally believe that Lou convinced Heather to send the video of the burn book to a fairly popular guy at our school who is a really big gossip.

He ended up sending it to at least half the school. This caused a lot of distress between my friends and I and we definitely freaked out. My boyfriend, who is also one of my best friends, hurt himself really badly over it and I didn't even know until a month or so ago. 

It calmed down around the beginning of May and I've completely cut contact until recently.

Around the time of the drama, a complete stranger contacted one of my friends and was harassing her. We're pretty confident that it was a burner account made by Lou, but we had no real evidence.

We ignored this but a few weeks ago Heather decided to start talking shit about one of my friends very openly. (On her public discord profile.)

I decided to message that alt account I mentioned previously because both Heather and Lou had blocked me on their main accounts. I tried to ask what was going on and admittedly, I was a bit rude about it. This was extremely stupid on my end.

The next day I got messages from Heather, Lou, and all of their friends harassing me and my friends. They were yelling at me for bringing up old drama when H literally brought it up again after it all calmed down. After this, Heather and one of her online buddies literally put a picture of my fucking HOUSE on their statuses on their discord profiles.

I‚Äôve been dating my gf (Rosalie) for about 4 years now and have been to her house numerous times. She has a younger sister who I‚Äôll call Elaine(6yo), who her parents had 12 years after and because of this the whole house spoils her. 

About 6 months ago they allowed her to have a computer and now everytime I come over Elaine wants me to play with her. Normally I‚Äôll come up and play with her for about 30 minutes but when I eventually try to break away to be with who I actually came for, Elaine will cry and scream at the top of her lungs which is very annoying.

However, I didn‚Äôt want to and this caused a big fight between us and I ended up going home early. 
Elaine also just generally sucks the fun out of anything I try to do with her. For example, when I do eventually give in it turns into her screaming and crying because I did 1 miniscule thing that she thinks is the end of the world (ex: picking up a different color truck than the one she wants). 

Because of Elaine‚Äôs attitude I have stopped playing with her as often and purposefully pretend like I don‚Äôt hear her asking me to play with her or giving short answers when she shoves her tablet in my face to show me her game character. I understand that she‚Äôs only 6 and I‚Äôve tried to ignore it but it seriously ticks me off when she throws her tantrums and Rosalie looks at me as if I‚Äôm the AH for not catering to HER little sister.

42,1dogtr9,AITA for insisting on an official marriage?,"Eng is not my language, so excuse me.

This is about me (30F) and A (30M).

I know him all my life, we grew up in the same yard, at the age of 16 one day I called him to walk together and we started dating. We dated for seven years, were each other's first in a lot of things.

There were many different situations during this time, we met at a distance for a while, fought and made up; then I moved to his place in the city, we lived together for 1,5 years. After that, we broke up, peacefully and respectfully.

I moved to another major city, been living here for 6 years now. I had other relationships, lived with other men for a while. I was offered to get married, but everything was not the same. 

About the A I always remembered, we kept in touch remotely; he is a friend of my family, was my best friend when we were dating.

He also had relationships with others after we, I don't know the details there, but from what he says there was no love there, it didn't work out. He lives in our hometown.

A year ago (in July) I broke up with a guy V, I was going through the breakup hard. A found out about it and supported me morally. 

In March, I initiated our meeting to talk to each other. After that we met a few more times, talked a lot about our common past and what we would like in the future.

After many days and hours of talking, we made a decision to be together, to gradually solve all the problems that arise, to go to therapy if necessary; he will move to my city. Now for two months I feel happy and ""whole"". We both want children, a family. With him that I imagine myself in my old age on the Porch (""Porch test"", HIMYM).

What‚Äôs important to me is that I don‚Äôt want to cohabit before official marriage.

There are questions about the future that can't be resolved yet. I want specifics, how many months to decide when he will move in, discuss a shared budget, income, maternity. He supports these conversations and is ready to agree to anything I say. But about the official marriage - he wants to wait for some time, agrees to live in different apartments in the same city and just ""date"" to see how things are going.

His plans were to move to my city in August. Now the circumstances are such that I need to move out of the apartment and move to another one (I live on rent). The difficulty I have is that I do not know for how long to look for a new apartment just for myself - two months or a year, two. Also, if we live together, we need a 2-room apartment, at least, but I can't rent such an apartment in advance, I can't afford it.

I have been experiencing financial difficulties for the last month, and A. helped me with money when my cat got sick, it means a lot to me; and he doesn't mind helping me more, but I refuse.

He is a wonderful man, very kind, intelligent. I'm 100% sure he's not lying or using me, and that he does have plans for a family and children with me.

43,1dogmvq,WIBTA if I told my husband I'm mad that he asked his late mom to choose our firstborn daughter's name?,"
My husband and I (both mid thirties) have 2 sons. We both agree we would like more kids at some point. 

My husband recently lost his mother, and when she first got sick, he told me that he had suggested to her that she choose ""a name"" for ""her first grandaughter"" (his mother has 4 grandsons). His idea was that the prospect of having a grandaughter and choosing her name could give his mother something to look forward to and help her get better. I was surprised but supportive at the time, thinking a/ that he was talking about choosing ""a"" name (ie probably a middle name) and b/ that if this could help keep his mother motivated through chemo then I would be an asshole if I made a fuss about it.

Fast forward a month later, MIL's treatment had failed, but she had chosen a name for her ""first grandaughter"" and during her last few days I heard my husband talking to her about this future child, calling her by the name MIL had chosen, but I felt it wasn't the time to discuss this with my husband since he was losing his mother...

A few weeks after my MIL passed away, my husband asked when we'd start trying to have *name chosen by MIL*, and I asked my husband to confirm this was a middle name and that if we had a daughter together in the future we would choose her first name together. He didn't take it well, saying he wanted this to be the kid's first name since this was his promise to his mother, but that if I wanted it to only be a middle name then he'd accept my decision (in a kind of passive agressive / hurt and disappointed manner). He added that if we did decide to choose a name together, his vote would always be *first name chosen by MIL*. 

I should mention that I do like the name MIL chose, but also that she had a daughter of her own who she got to name as she pleased...

I feel like I would be the bad guy if I put my foot down on this, but I'm upset that he made that promise to his mom in the first place since it would stop us from choosing the name of our first - and probably only - daughter together...

I talked this through with a friend who told me to let it go since he lost his mom and if I have a girl one day I should just give her MIL's name since I like it anyway and even though she got to name her daughter years ago that's not an argument for her not getting to name mine since ""tastes change""...

So WIBTA if I told my husband he really hurt me by not taking into account that I may want to play a part in naming my hypothetical firstborn daughter?

A classmate of mine invited me and a few buddies to a concert. The day of the concert she comes pulling into the parking space and gets out staggering and swaying. She was DRUNK Little did I know she had kids with her. I was a tad upset but I didn't say anything until after the concert, one of my buddies asked her ""you sober enough to drive?"" She took a few minutes to answer but said ""no I am ok I got it"" so I came up and took the keys and told them I have a valid drivers license I can drive. Well after I dropped my buddy off at home I discovered how sensitive her gas pettle was and actually went over the speed limit. But I slowed down instantly. I accidentally made a wrong turn and got us lost for a bit I  then made a U turn onto the freeway and got us back into the city.

So here is what happened that lead up to this title. 
A classmate of mine invited me and a few buddies to a concert. The day of the concert she comes pulling into the parking space and gets out staggering and swaying. She was DRUNK Little did I know she had kids with her. I was a tad upset but I didn't say anything until after the concert, one of my buddies asked her ""you sober enough to drive?"" She took a few minutes to answer but said ""no I am ok I got it"" so I came up and took the keys and told them I have a valid drivers license I can drive. Well after I dropped my buddy off at home I discovered how sensitive her gas pettle was and actually went over the speed limit. But I slowed down instantly. I accidentally made a wrong turn and got us lost for a bit I  then made a U turn onto the freeway and got us back into the city.

46,1dofr2h,AITA for asking my friends how to communicate with another friend?,"So I (19nb) have a group of friends from back home, before I went to college. There are 2 guys (19 and 16 I‚Äôll call D and B) and a girl (19) who I was never really as close with.

The girl is very opinionated, and tends to either ignore people or get mad if they disagree with her. I have trouble being polite sometimes, especially to people like her, but there have been several occasions where I‚Äôve carefully voiced how I don‚Äôt like the way she responds to certain things, and it usually just gets brushed over. 

So about a week ago, D gave us the news in a gc that he got back together with his ex. None of us really likes her when they were dating, and even he‚Äôs admitted that she was really toxic when they were together before, but he claims she‚Äôs changed. 

So I started messaging him privately, basically saying it was his choice but if it turned out the ex hadn‚Äôt changed I gave him advice on what to look out for and the things he seemed to not notice the last time. He and I agreed that that was that. 

But B and the girl were talking about it in the gc, and the girl was basically forcing her opinion on D. When B asked about my opinion, I told them I was having a private conversation with D and didn‚Äôt wanna speak out in the gc. Then B and the girl were asking why, I went to a separate gc with just B and D, and asked them for a nicer way to say that the way the girl was responding was pissing me off. 

B got really mad at me, and asked why I wasn‚Äôt just saying what I had to say in the main gc. I explained that the girl tended to have bad reactions to what I would say, or that I would get ignored. I also explained that she has a tendency to play the victim, talking about how hard her life is whenever someone challenges her, which upsets me because she‚Äôs living with her parents while I had to drop out of school and am struggling to live. Everything I said in that group chat I‚Äôve said to her, just in a nicer way. 

Later that day the girl messaged me and said that she didn‚Äôt appreciate me ‚Äútalking shit‚Äù and she asked why I hadn‚Äôt said any of that stuff to her, even though I have. I gave her examples of times I‚Äôve tried talking to her and I‚Äôve gotten ignored, and she blew up saying that I‚Äôm selfish and make everything about myself, constantly comparing my life to hers. I have only done that a few times, when she‚Äôs used how hard her life is as a tactic to not take blame. I called her a hypocrite and kind of blew up at her about the way she treats everybody. She blocked me. 

I later talked to B about it, and apologized if I made it seem like I was dragging him into the middle of it. He said that it just seems like I don‚Äôt like the girl, and it felt to me like he was still upset at me.

D doesn‚Äôt wanna get involved, as it might make the other 2 mad at him, and I don‚Äôt really blame him considering they‚Äôre there and I‚Äôm far away

47,1dofpuh,AITA My friend went to the MCM without me.,"I have been going to the London MCM every year with my friend Caeleb but this may he refused to take me.

I have mild autism and Caeleb knows this. He usually books the hotel and we split the cost. The two of us don't live anywhere near London, like 400 miles away, so it's pretty much if we can't get a hotel orr air BNB we can't go.

Anyway, when the May MCM was coming up I asked Caeleb if he was going, he said yes. I asked if I could go and he said, ""If you can find accomodation this close to the event then sure.""

I asked about going with him. and he said no. When I asked why he pretty much spat venom. 

He said, ""Last Ocrtober I told you I'd pick you up at  7PM, when I got there you had nothing ready and you took literally 2 hours to get ready, I had to change my plans to accomodate that, I should have fucking gone without you. Then you had the nerve to pressure me to trade my weekend ticket for your Friday and Sunday. Plus you didn't pay until after the event even though you had like ¬£400 in your pocket that your rich dad gave you.""

For some context, Our bus wasn't set to leave until 9:45PM, Caeleb wanted to get in way too early. I needed to get my belongings packed. He was going to leave his car in town and walk to the station. Instead we got a lift straight to the station from my brother. 

As or trading tickets, Caeleb had a cosplay photo shoot planned on the saturday at the hotel. He told me I couldn't be in the room even though he knew I didn't have a saturday ticket. I thought it was a good idea to trade, he didn't seem very happy about it but I managed to persuade him. He said he was pissed because if we hadn't swapped he could have gone to the Con after the shoot. But if he wanted me out of the room and I didn't have a Saturday ticket where would I go?

As for not paying until after the event, he knew the money I had was my spending money for the con. 

He refused to see if he could ammend his booking to make it for two, and went without me.

 I confronted him when he got back and he asked me why don't I ask here.

49,1dofddw,AITA for having reservations about my ex traveling with his GF and our young son? ,"I am a 28F with a young son, Hank (4), my ex Ed is a 48M.

This past week my Ex and I started having serious discussions about his new GF Ana (28F) spending time around our son. We had a huge fight but came around to some sort of understanding and she ended up meeting him briefly this past Sat. They have been seeing each other about four weeks.

Yesterday, Ed asks if he can take Hank to Florida for a long weekend this upcoming weekend. I am tentative just because its hard to go more than a night or two without seeing Hank (We have 50/50 custody) and Ive been in a rough place (mainly financial stress as I work at a non-profit) and want to spend time with my kid. 

I end up coming around and agreeing to the Florida trip. A couple hours later I find out he also intends to bring Ana on this trip. I feel super uncomfortable with this idea. Hank just met her three days ago, I haven't met her, and they haven't been seeing each other for very long in my opinion. I take an hour to think about it and try to put my feelings aside and tell him I give the trip my blessing if I can meet her beforehand. He agrees and gives me her info.

Today, I get a text inviting me to also go to Florida but am not invited to stay in the rental house with them. He tells me I can find a ""cheap hotel nearby"". Our son has gotten to the age where he is asking all the time for the three of us to do things together. We have even (unsuccessfully) tried to coordinate trips/weekends together in the past and it just hasn't worked out due to logistics, finances, etc. For the most part Edward and I have an amazing and supportive co-parenting relationship. 

I told him that I felt deeply upset about being a tack-on extra when if I¬†was¬†going to go it would be to have quality time with my son, not to stay separately on my own and tag along when invited to their plans. On top of this is the fact that it would not be a smart financial decision for me to go independently and Ed knows this. I told him that if he wanted the three of us to do something together then we should just do something together, and if he wanted me to stay separately then he should rescind the invite, which he then proceeds to do.

I have been reeling about this all day and the issue is two-fold. 1. That I feel like it is so early on to be traveling pretty far away (We live in VA) with a girlfriend that has not really been on-ramped into Hank's life appropriately, on top of the fact that she is a stranger to me and I feel uncomfortable with the whole idea this early on. 2. The emotional whiplash and what feels like a half hearted invitation to admonish his own guilt about the trip and hurting my feelings only to rescind it in order to protect this new girls feelings. I just feel super anxious about the whole thing and we both have been throwing around terms like what's ""normal"" and I just feel like this isn't normal.

50,1dofac6,AITA for not helping my friend after he was kicked out of his house?,"I made a post about this on r/advice a couple days ago, but some serious shit has hit the fan. 

Basically my (17M) friend ""George"" (18M) was kicked out of his house. I don't know why he was kicked out, and to be honest, I don't really want to know after what happened. 

George and I used to be friends until he started to act strange and distant. He would make comments about my ""life choices"" (for context, I'm a part of the queer community) and would always vent to me about his relationship and how his girlfriend would be touchy with her other girl friends and that it made him uncomfortable. George was also the type of guy to grab at his male friends in an inappropriate way ""as a joke"", which is why him being mad about his girlfriend really surprised me. 

One day, George stops talking to me altogether for seemingly no reason. Later I messaged him to ask if he was okay, and that if he was mad at me that he should say something (I'm also neurodivergent, so I don't always pick up on social cues or annoying social things I'm doing).

He then listed all of the reasons he hates me and thinks I'm a terrible person. I'm not perfect, so I tried to respond amicably and apologize, as well as thank him for his feedback, which just pissed him off even more. He said a lot of rude things about my friends and some weird homophobic and transphobic shit, then never talked to me again. 

Now, months later, I get a message from a friend of mine, lets call him Doug. Since it's June, Doug and I recently went to pride together as friends. He ended up mentioning that he isn't out to his family, and I said that my house would always be a safe space he could stay. Doug really appreciated this, and came out to his family, which went well enough. 

Doug reached out to me about George, because George had been staying at Doug's place, but Doug and his family were leaving for a vacation. Doug remembered what I told him and asked me if I was available to help out George. As far as I know, Doug knows nothing about what happened between George and I. 

Now George needs a place to stay, which would explain his odd behavior over the past week or so (hugging me and telling me that he loved me). I reached out to message him and ask what he needed. He said that he needed a place to sleep for two nights and that he would do anything to have a place to sleep, and that he has a job and is waiting to start so he can lease an apartment. He asked if we could meet up to talk about what was happening, but I was out of town with my family. 

In the end, I didn't help him for many reasons. He called me an asshole and hasn't messaged me since. Doug and I's relationship is now a bit rocky.

53,1doeppr,AITA for potentially kicking out my sister who is a single mother ,"I, a 31 year old single woman has been helping my sister with raising my nephew. We‚Äôll call him Jake. After the pandemic and my mother‚Äôs death, I took it upon myself to help my older sister. Before my mother died, she gave me 10k for if I ever bought a house. During the pandemic was when I bought a 4 bedroom 4 bathroom house so she could move from California to the East coast with me. I used my veterans affairs home loan to be the sister and I never had. I love them very much. The problem is that the stipulations I put in place 2 years before she moved here have been consistently disregarded by the parent and child.

1. Keep living spaces such as the adult and child‚Äôs room clean. If you make a mess clean it up. 

2. Pay your bills on time. Shouldn‚Äôt require too much explanation. 

I now have a big German roach infestation and often times come home after a long night shift to a messy house. Neither my sister or nephew clean up after themselves and I become the asshole for pointing out that my house should be maintained. I dropped her from my insurance plan and phone plan and gave her the ultimatum that she unfuck herself and her child‚Äôs space while he is visiting his dad.

I don't mind talking to them on the phone but if I go out a few times with them, I start to feel like that's enough for a while. But they got annoyed that I'm a homebody and I generally stay home more often. I go to grad school and I also work and then I go out with family on the weekends. So it's not like I'm not doing anything with my life, but my 2 friends find me weird that I don't go out a lot or socialize. They said it themselves, they find it weird how I live my life.

55,1doe32u,AITA for refusing to cosign for bail ,"
My brother in law (35 years old) is an addict. He has been in prison for felony charges related to possessing, distributing, and manufacturing drugs in the past. He was recently arrested again for selling fentanyl to an undercover cop. I believe he is still on parole too. So, not looking good.

My mother in law was not comfortable posting bail for him. She has financial issues and really cannot afford the $10,000 to give a bondsman. I have tried to tell her she should not as she isn't able to but I think my brother in law and his girlfriend have guilted her into it.

They found a bondsman that would take $3,000. However, my MIL is retired and lives in an apartment. My brother in law has basically been squatting in his old apartment. They need a cosigner who has a job and owns a home. My home with my husband is in my name. So here comes the problem. They want me to cosign. Supposedly there is no collateral, we wouldn't lose my house or something if he  didn't show up to court or missed payments. I have said no though because I don't think anyone should be bailing him out. He made his choices and was aware of the consequences. I am also not comfortable signing my name to something that is bad for my mother in law financially. Basically, why would I sign my name to something I disagree with?

After I said no they were both coming at me. My mother in law said it's her business who she helps and I said I agree, it is also my business what I sign my name to. My brother in law is basically begging me to do it even though I said no, insisting he is going to stay sober and work to pay some of the money and how this deal saves them money. ""You're my only hope"" he told me. Mind you we don't talk outside of family gatherings

AITA for saying no? My husband is at least on my side but mostly because he doesn't believe there is no collateral if I sign. I don't even want to talk to the bondsman. My no should be enough for them but they aren't respecting that.

59,1dod3gt,"AITA for not giving a homeless lady cash and offering food instead?
","Hey Reddit, I (23F) recently had a troubling encounter with a homeless lady and I'm not sure if I handled the situation correctly. Here's what happened: So, I was at Subway getting my order, and there was a homeless lady who was starting a fight with someone? She did say at the time that the man was harassing her and her boyfriend. She left before I paid for my food, but when I got outside, she was standing by the exit on the sidewalk I needed to walk directly home, and approached me and asked if I wanted to buy something off of her because she and her boyfriend had just moved into the area. 

I was a bit scared because of her previous behavior, and I didn't have any cash on me, and only brought my gift card with me which I used the last of the funds on the food, so I offered her my lunch instead, as I thought it would keep the interaction brief. She then asked if I had CashApp and said she really just needed $20.

While this was happening, I was on the phone with my friend who overheard the conversation (I had them on speaker and yes sorry I know it was bad Subway etiquette) and yelled ""No!"" over the phone when she asked for money. The lady started going off on me and my friend, mostly me because I was on the phone.

I didn't even get a chance to answer, and I kept my distance because I didn't want to make her any more upset. As the lady was walking away, she said something along the lines of ""How could your friend even say no to someone she hasn't met? She doesn't know what I've been through.""

I felt really sad because it's clear that this lady has been through a lot, and I've been homeless before too (though graciously it was only a few months plus I couldn't imagine what it would be like during this heat wave) but the altercation also scared me. I'm also pretty sure this is the same lady who's been walking around my area lately, and I've had a negative experience with her before.

60,1dod2gl,AITA for lashing out at my ex and saying he's not my baby's father?,"I (f34) had been with my husband for over 12 years. We had our child when i was 31, and my husband 33. Sadly, recently (1.5 y. ago, when my baby was around 2 y.) my husband, the love of my life, died in a tragic accident (careless driver hit his car on a foggy slippery road, he died instantly in a crash). His death left me in shambles, only thing that kept me at least sane was our daughter.   I couldn't believe that i lost him. He was my rock, my light and I loved him dearly. In a way I still cannot believe that he's gone. 

That's where my ex comes in. In about year after my husband's accident, he reached out to me to talk, to vent maybe. We separated long time ago, couple of years before I've met my husband. We didn't exactly stay friends but were on good terms, and spoke occaisonally - hi, how are you kind of talk. So he reached out and offered to help as a friend. It was unexpected but I accepted because I really needed a friend and frankly I don't have a lot of close friends besides him. 

He occaisonally came over to our place, brought some gifts to my daughter and we talked over tea or a beer. It wasn't intimate - he had several casual relationships over the years, and I clearly told him that I'm not ready for any relationships after my husband (still not ready, i guess). 

So he came over once or twice a month, he was very sweet with my daughter, so I didn't see anything wrong with them bonding. But then my baby started calling my ex papa. It annoyed me very much, but i didn't say anything, because she's a toddler - how is she supposed to now any better? I tried gently explaining to her that my ex isn't papa, but i doubt she understood. So I just started sending her to my or my husband's mom when my ex came over. In truth I know our baby won't remember her father - photos is all she'll have of him. And i don't want another man to take his place in her eyes. 

So everything was normal again. I noticed that my ex was visibly upset when I told him that my daughter isn't home. But i didn't think much of it. 
And last time is where I snapped. That's where i might be the AH, because I ended up screaming at my ex and probably should have handled it better. 
So when he was at our house and we played some video games and had couple of beers, my mother brought my daughter home early - she was very grumpy and wanted to go home. He stood up and told my daughter - here's MY baby, I missed you! And reached to hug her. 

That's where I snapped at him. I told him angrily that he is in fact not her father, and that she is my and my husband's baby and will never be his baby no matter how much he wants it. And if he wants to have a child he still have plenty of chances with his girlfriend. 
He told me I was a real ah for saying such cruel things and left. 
My mother told me that I was kind of an asshole too and I acted like a child. 
So am I? 
",Not the A-hole,2024-06-25,"AITA for lashing out at my ex and saying he's not my baby's father? I (f34) had been with my husband for over 12 years. We had our child when i was 31, and my husband 33. Sadly, recently (1.5 y. ago, when my baby was around 2 y.) my husband, the love of my life, died in a tragic accident (careless driver hit his car on a foggy slippery road, he died instantly in a crash). His death left me in shambles, only thing that kept me at least sane was our daughter.   I couldn't believe that i lost him. He was my rock, my light and I loved him dearly. In a way I still cannot believe that he's gone. 

That's where my ex comes in. In about year after my husband's accident, he reached out to me to talk, to vent maybe. We separated long time ago, couple of years before I've met my husband. We didn't exactly stay friends but were on good terms, and spoke occaisonally - hi, how are you kind of talk. So he reached out and offered to help as a friend. It was unexpected but I accepted because I really needed a friend and frankly I don't have a lot of close friends besides him.

61,1docw8m,WIBTA if I stopped paying for booze,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and own a home together. As far as bills and expenses go we make approximately the same and contribute the same to our household expenses. Alternate who pays for date night etc.

Where we differ are our drinking habits and our saving habits. When we met I was going through some stuff and was in my mind becoming dependent on alcohol. Part of this took place over COVID and so I gave myself a bit of a by but rapidly found it was a problem so I stopped for a few months, and now I may occasionally have a glass of wine in date night and little else through the week.

While I tend not to drink much, my boyfriend is a total partier, he will drink easily 5 drinks while we are on date night and be intoxicated however this is actually a daily occurrence and he drinks through the day and night (its normally like 2-3 magnums of wine and a case of beer a week).

I have told him that this bothers me and he claims that he is scaling down, but it has made me rethink our relationship long term as I really am uncomfortable having to help him up the stairs at night or support him staggering home.his friends have expressed some concern but a number of them follow the same habit and their wives have just said that they don‚Äôt care as long as they can hold their liquor.

In terms of savings I try to put away 40% of my pay check and he does not - a lot of it hoes towards things I consider luxuries- including his fancy car he just bought himself.

Now on to where I may be the asshole.

 He sometimes will ask me to go get him wine because he has run out and is too drunk to drive. I used to say yes but I feel I‚Äôm just enabling him so I want  to say no especially because he doesn‚Äôt pay me back for it. I keep bringing up how much he is drinking too because long term I believe it will shorten his life/ our life together.

 Similarly on date night I am inclined to split the bill moving forward as I‚Äôll have a $20 entree and he will have something similar but the bill will be over $150 due to the booze. Obviously this has been going on for some time but I was doing my budget  a few months back and it was a bit of a come to Jesus moment when I realized that while I drink on average 1-2 drinks a week I‚Äôm spending over $500 on alcohol monthly which I just don‚Äôt think is sustainable or healthy.

Small edit. I have already talked to him about this more times than I can count. I see a problem but he doesn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt know what more I can say beyond taking a hardline stance in the matter

I (21F) have some high impact hobbies (fighting sport) and I‚Äôm exploring kink (safely). So, I usually have bruises at any given time. For the kink bruises, I do try to make sure that they stay in bathing suit areas or places normally covered by clothing since they‚Äôre often more identifiable, but it‚Äôs not always possible between the two passtimes. If anyone asks, they‚Äôre sports bruises. It‚Äôs never really been a problem before now except for when I dress out at the gym. Much love to the older ladies who kindly but mistakenly slipped me DV crisis numbers and asked if I needed to talk, they‚Äôre doing the Lord‚Äôs work.

It‚Äôs really hot where I live right now, like worse than usual this year, so I live in shorts and tank tops when not at work.  All my friends know what‚Äôs up and aren‚Äôt bothered by it, so when we‚Äôre hanging out I don‚Äôt always go to extra trouble to cover up. The one exception is Anna (22F).  Anna found out by accident through someone else that I‚Äôm into kink and has been really weird and snide about it ever since. 

I just came off a really great tournament weekend, so I‚Äôm pretty marked up. My apartment complex has a pool, so I and some friends who live in the same complex were hanging out and cooling off yesterday evening. Anna showed up with one of them and flipped her shit when she saw me, saying that I‚Äôm disgusting for flaunting my bruises and that I‚Äôm retraumatizing abuse survivors by not being fully covered up. She left in a huff when I argued that I‚Äôm not exactly skimpily dressed in a one piece swimsuit and that she knows full well these are sports bruises given that I posted a video of my final four bout to the group chat Sunday.

Since then she‚Äôs been demanding an apology for being exposed to my kink without consent. Some of the friends think I should apologize to shut her up while others think she‚Äôs nuts. I just don‚Äôt think existing in public with bruises is anything to apologize for? Y‚Äôall tell me.

Then my mother stopped talking to me for 3 weeks following the wedding. She didn't reply to texts and emails and refused calls. I eventually just called her and asked if everything was okay. She said no, she was pissed off about my wedding.


For a bit of context, my mother and father split up when I was 4. It has never been amicable between them, especially when my mum remarried my stepfather. There were always issues. Mine and my dad's relationship became strained, but we have since grown closer than ever. I've always been close to my dad's side of the family, but equally am close with my mum's family, even though they all live miles away.

My mum felt the wedding was all about my dad's side of the family and was upset that none of the speeches mentioned my stepfather's helping bring me up. My stepfather and I have a strained relationship. I never liked him growing up. He was controlling of my mother and jealous of my relationship with her. He had some medical issues over a year ago, and I helped a lot in looking after him and supporting my mum. He has since mellowed slightly. My dad was never going to mention him in a speech, and the other speeches from the groom and best man wouldn't have mentioned him either. I basically told her I had no say in the speeches, and if he wanted a mention, he should have done his own speech. 


She then told me her father was upset as this was the first family event since my grandmother had passed over 10 years ago. And he didn't feel it was 'special' enough. My partner and I have experienced lots of losses over the years, and we honoured each of them on our orders of service and a memory table of pictures at the reception. My partner all made a toast to all those who could not be there. I don't know how I could have made it any more special.
The wedding was about myself and my husband, and my mum is upset it wasn't about her and her family, that they didn't get a big enough mention.

64,1doclnq,AITA for suggesting we name our baby after my ex/dead friend? ,"My husband (30M) and I (28F) are pregnant and thinking of baby names for our son due later this year. We‚Äôve got a good list of names we love, but we‚Äôre still undecided. The other night I was up late with a bought of insomnia, thinking about when our baby is going to be a kid and what he‚Äôll be like, and I remembered my childhood best friend, Lucas. 

We were best friends from 5 until 15, when he passed away. About a month before he died, we started ‚Äúdating‚Äù, as in we held hands in the hall at school and kissed a handful of times. My husband knows about him as I have fond memories with him and he‚Äôs in a lot of my childhood photos. He has never shown any disdain to me talking about Lucas. I also do not harbor any leftover romantic feelings for Lucas. I loved him, but we were not in love, just kids doing what kids do. He was my best friend and I miss him, but he is dead.

Lucas is a pretty timeless name with multiple variations, as well as a way to honor my childhood best friend, especially since he doesn‚Äôt have any siblings who could name their children after him. Plus, a lot of my and my husbands first name ideas have multiple syllables, so I thought a short middle name like Luke would help balance it out. 

I suggested it and my husband hit the roof. He said me wanting to name our baby after an ex-boyfriend was gross and insulting to him as the father. He said if the baby should be named after anyone, it should be him. I told him I wasn‚Äôt trying to be insulting and it was just an idea, not a name I was set on and him vetoing it was completely fine. I also said it wasn‚Äôt naming our baby after an ex, but an old friend. He‚Äôs still angry, though, and is demanding I apologize for disrespecting him as the father. 

I refused to apologize because the suggestion wasn‚Äôt a way to disrespect him. It had nothing to do with him at all, it was just a way to pay homage to my friend. He said he‚Äôs not interested in brainstorming ideas anymore and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. AITA? 

ETA: I will be apologizing to my husband, a lot of people pointed out that whether I meant to offend him or not, his feelings were hurt and I do want to try and remedy that. I‚Äôm also going to try and have a conversation about how he feels about Lucas moving forward. 

I now see a lot of people are getting caught by the ex part, as my husband is. I assumed it was clear that I do not still have feelings for Lucas. I do not wish I was having a baby with him instead. He was not a childhood crush. As an adult, I know that we were pairing off because that‚Äôs what everyone else our age was doing and he was my very best friend, so why not? When he died, I mourned the death of a friend, not an ex lover. 

I am also not trying to force this name on our baby. It was merely a suggestion because I thought it was sweet and it fit what we were looking for in names. If my husband says no, it‚Äôs a no.

I start to yell quietly at him to use the restroom or get out of the house as my sister 3f and 2f were sleeping.

He leaves the house crying and I get in trouble too for calling him a fata$$. But he knew 3F and 2F were asleep. He was also loud when coming in and talks loud too. 

He is a bit obese but the reason I call him fata$$ everything he pisses me off is because he eats all the food in the house to the point where we have to spend more money to have food or eat fast food which is hard as 5F Grace has undiagnosed ADHD (Me and my brother have ADHD too) while 3F we will call Alice is on the spectrum of autism, and 2F is horrible in public but 13M doesn't see that and he isn't forced to take care of the 24/7!

I start to yell quietly at him to use the restroom or get out of the house as my sister 3f and 2f were sleeping. After 5 to 15 minutes of arguing my mom tells him to get out but he goes to the window by the front door and teases Grace as she got out of the truck scared. I tell him to ""get out"" he replied with ""Shut the fuck up bitch"" I replied with ""FATA$$ THIS IS WHY MO ONE LOVES YOU!"" He started crying like a baby and my mom yells at him waking up 3F. He leaves the house crying and I get in trouble too for calling him a fata$$. But he knew 3F and 2F were asleep. He was also loud when coming in and talks loud too. 

He is a bit obese but the reason I call him fata$$ everything he pisses me off is because he eats all the food in the house to the point where we have to spend more money to have food or eat fast food which is hard as 5F Grace has undiagnosed ADHD (Me and my brother have ADHD too) while 3F we will call Alice is on the spectrum of autism, and 2F is horrible in public but 13M doesn't see that and he isn't forced to take care of the 24/7! I'm forced to take care of them 24/7! My mom doesn't work at all! Then he says ""You do nothing around the house"" but I feed the kids, I clean the house everyday as he makes a mess and the kids do to but they are younger and copy him 24/7, I also have mental and emotional issues but I hide it from doctors as i want to be the big sister with nothing worng with her as he only has emotional issues and refuses to take medication as I do to but I forget to as I'm taking care of everything

67,1doc7ur,AITA for telling my sister I can't take care of her kid all day?,"I live in multigenerational household with my father, sister, her husband and their two children. The younger child goes to kindergarten, and the older one's summer break began 2 weeks ago. She is seven.

In the past, whenever my sister and her husband needed me to take care of the kids, they would ask in advance. I don't mind shifting things around for the couple of hours required, as long as I'm told in advance. My sister works a full-time job in an office, and my brother-in-law is a teacher, also on summer break, so no classes currently.

Since last week, my niece has called me as soon as she wakes up (four or five times in total). The first time it was ""Mum's at work, dad's at work, can you come spend time with me?"" I don't want to leave a seven-year old in charge of herself, it will be fun, and she says dad's coming back in a couple of hours. He came back two hours later than he'd said, he got held up at school. No heads-up, no apology. Then the same thing two or three more times, only dad is going straight to their newly-bought flat to paint the walls and take care of the floors, doesn't mention this, doesn't come back before my sister returns from work. The same thing happens yesterday and today, and my sister is also an hour late from work.

I finally had enough. I'm not getting anything done, I'm drained from taking care of a very active child for hours on end, and it's really bothering me that they're treating me like an unpaid babysitter. I texted my sister to tell her that they can't count on me to take care of their kid full-time, especially not without asking me first. She said she wasn't planning on it being that way anyway. I might have misunderstood, but that seemed to me to imply that I'm overreacting and that it's not something that has happened several times already and is becoming a pattern. She apologised, saying she didn't mean to burden me. I told her that she might not have been planning on this going on, but that it \*is\* what's going on.

My father isn't really interested in spending time with my niece and is very impatient with her. The brother-in-law's mother and brother are MIA. So if the parents leave a seven-year old at home with me and my father, they're either expecting her to be on her own all day, or that I take care of her at least some of the time, and since she is seven and requires care and attention, probably most of the time. I don't see another option.

I think it probably reads from my post that my family is dysfunctional and that I don't really have healthy interpersonal skills. I have PTSD and anxiety and I'm extremely conflict-averse, so just standing up for myself over this was very exhausting. And with that comes doubt over whether I handled things alright, guilt over feeling like I'm passing the niece off like a hot potato even though I know that's not true because I love her to death, but I can't keep up with her for hours on end.

About 3 years ago mother allowed Brother 1, who was 16 at the time, to move in his girlfriend (She has a family and a house) I was opposed off the bat.

Since then my mother has allowed Brother 1, his girlfriend and any friends that he may bring over to completely disrespect her home, herself and her other children.

Over the course of 3 years Brother 1 and his girlfriend have left mess after mess, taken things, broken things, ruined decorative towels. Straight up stolen some of our things, and just overall don't contribute to the household.  His girlfriend was allowed to live her for free for 2 years while I gave my hard earned paychecks to my mother to pay bills. I even got my brother and his friend a job at my workplace and rides to and from since we lived together. 

But after 3 years of (trying) to teaching children that are just about a year younger than me things that I have known since I was 12, I am so incredibly fed up. These kids have endlessly talked shit about me being in my home. I have given up my hard earned money to pay bills that they never have to worry about. I have left work and using my only lunch break to pick up little brother while Brother 1 and Gf just sit at home. Even while currently not working I have had to use my savings multiple times to pay bills while brother 1 and gf never have to give up any of their savings.

I have tried so many times to tell my mother that by allowing Brother 1 and Gf to do whatever they please in our home is harming the rest of us. 

 I put a sticky note w his friends name on the dishes that said friend used and left for my mother to clean and he takes the note off tears it up and leaves it on the counter for me to clean up (he did this about 4 or 5 times.)

When they try to clean, they completely fail. Food is still stuck to the dishes, stove and counters. Salt all over the ground. Grease all over the stove. They've dirtied up the few kitchen towels and thrown them on the floor to be picked up and washed by me or my mother. 

All well Brother 1 expects mom to work 80 hrs. a week, pick up after him, pay all the bills by herself, do all the dishes and laundry. If mom and I acted the same way that brother and gf do then the house would be more in shambles than it already is, they leave things and expect others to finish the job. But when its brought to their attention its always some excuse like ""oh i just didn't know how."" 

I have since withdrawn from any house work that benefits anyone other than myself and my cat and quit my job to help lessen my financial burden , unfortunately that affects no one but my mother.

74,1doatsq,AITA for not having catered vegan food at my wedding?,"Throwaway in case my friend is on here 

I (27F) got married recently. I invited a friend (27F) and her partner, and she was excited to come. They live in another country (a 3.5h flight away) so coming isn‚Äôt easy or cheap for them.

We asked 7 months before the wedding about dietary needs, and she told us her and her partner would need vegan options. Since my dinner included veggie options, I (wrongly) assumed the caterer could also do vegan ones, but when I asked 1.5 month before the wedding I learned they couldn‚Äôt (I should‚Äôve asked earlier, unfortunately some things came up and delayed our prep).

I informed my friend, saying I was sorry, initially asking her if she had ideas about what we could do (maybe I was in the wrong there), and then offering to cook something myself or buy something from a supermarket, but the conversation turned quite cold, and the next day she said she decided not to come to the wedding, or to the bachelorette that was happening the following week (even though there was no catering issue there). She said her decision was final and we could speak after the wedding, as she didn‚Äôt want to upset me before the day.

After a couple of days I asked if she could help me understand her decision, and she said she found it disrespectful that I didn‚Äôt have a suitable vegan option for her and her partner so close to the date, even though they told me with plenty of notice. 

I felt extremely hurt and blindsided, especially since I feel she didn‚Äôt give me a chance to find a solution together. I kinda understand not coming to the wedding (even though I‚Äôm vegetarian and attended plenty of weddings that didn‚Äôt have veggie options, but that‚Äôs her call) but not skipping the bachelorette, since we could easily have planned for vegan food.

Now I‚Äôm not sure I want to be her friend anymore. AITA?

TLDR: my friend decided to skip both my bachelorette and my wedding because I didn‚Äôt have a good enough vegan option for my wedding dinner. I‚Äôm not sure I want to be her friend anymore. AITA?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your perspectives, you helped me see the situation more clearly.

Some bits of context:
- there were no restrictions at our venue for bringing home cooked / outside food. I genuinely thought a home cooked meal was a nice option, but I‚Äôm seeing that many of you think otherwise
- our dinner was a type of food with a base and toppings, and there was no other type of food available as the caterer specialises in that, but it caters to most people since you can choose the toppings (it worked for our 2 other guests who had restrictions, being gluten free and nut free). I knew for sure it was vegetarian, didn‚Äôt know they couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt want to make a separate vegan batch.
- I told my friend about this casually over text, while we were discussing the bachelorette. I now see that I probably shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned it until I could give her a more detailed option. I thought it would be nice to keep her in the loop and know what she preferred, but I now see how that probably made her feel like a burden, which I‚Äôm very sorry about
- the caterer had to be booked 10 months in advance, before we asked for restrictions, and when I asked about vegan options they didn‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt have time to sort one out, just that they flat out didn‚Äôt offer any, but maybe I should‚Äôve pushed back harder on that 
- some of you are saying I shouldn‚Äôt have asked for restrictions at all if I couldn‚Äôt provide them, but we were able to provide for other allergies (gluten and nuts) just not vegan meals unfortunately 

Overall, I understand that the biggest mistake was clearly leaving it so late to sort it out, the second and most stupid mistake was bringing up supermarket food, when it was never a viable option, and the third mistake was telling my friend about it and asking for her input, as it probably made her feel like a burden

I will now wait and see if she wants to reach out, and take things from there if she does

He met his partner (Mike) 9 years ago and the 3 of us have become extremely close. We see each other at least once a week and I chat with Rob through text daily.
We go on an annual trip together to the same place on the same weekend in August, we‚Äôve done this for 5 years.
We booked the accommodations for the trip in February. A month later, Mike suddenly sent a text in our group chat and asked if we could cancel the trip this year due to him not having a good time on last year‚Äôs trip. I asked for details. Rob called me and said Mike was being harsh, asked me not to cancel yet, and said they need space to work through some things but he will be happy to explain when they‚Äôre ready. I agreed - we went no contact for a month before they were ready to discuss.
We had a 2 hour FaceTime call where they brought up many things I have done over the years that have upset them - none of which I knew anything about.

One example specific to the trip is: I always go on a hike early in the morning to watch the sunrise, then I go for a morning swim in the lake. Every morning when I leave, their room door is closed and I assume they‚Äôre asleep since I wake up earlier than most people. Mike said that it seems like I‚Äôm upset with them and don‚Äôt want to spend time with them. I explain that if they told me that they want to join on first day this happened, I could have waited or told them when to set their alarm to join me.

Every single thing they brought up seemed like a very obvious issue of a lack of communication from their side, I tried to explain my intention with each action they brought up, but Mike said that the more I explain the more it seems like I am minimizing their feelings. Rob was in the middle, it seemed like he agreed with what both of us were saying. Honestly it all was very exhausting and immature. I ended the conversation by saying a lot of this could have been avoided if they just told me in the moment that what I was doing upset them, because none of it is intentional so I have no way of knowing I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

Since the conversation, they are acting as if nothing happened. They‚Äôve recently started talking about being excited for our trip.
I can‚Äôt really let the conversation go. Whenever we hang out I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells now, I am worried that I‚Äôm accidentally doing things that upsets them and they are secretly building resentment that I won‚Äôt hear about until they explode years down the line. 
I talked about it with my other friends and they have suggested coming on this yearly trip with me instead so I won‚Äôt need to worry about upsetting them while I‚Äôm on vacation.

I've worked everything out with the people from the government and am currently just waiting to check out the place I've got lined up. Due to going to school full-time, I can't work as it would cause burnout (I have autism.)

The thing is, I live with my parents (bio mom and stepdad) and 2 of my 6 siblings, one of which (22m) has level 3 autism. This means that someone *needs* to be home to make sure the door is unlocked for my brother, otherwise he will try to find us even though we're at work/school.

Because I'm the youngest in the house, I've always had to take care of him as my parents don't think that I actually have a life of my own. Problem is, I haven't had the possibility to have a life of my own since they got together when I was 9 years old, as it's been my brother's.

Since the government is gonna help me financially, I've obviously been looking at places to move to, but I haven't told anyone in the house about everything, only vaguely talking about meetings and saying half lies about why I have so many meetings (had 3 in row just last week.)

AITA if I go for sole legal and sole physical? 

Let me clear some possible questions: I have not and will not ever hold my son against him. I do not bash dad instead make excuses (which I shouldn't). I encourage him to call and ask to be picked up or ask why he is not. Most of those calls go unanswered. My son has his own phone so there is very little to no communication amongst us. Father does not contribute financially at all; dodges all court dates and works under the table to not show up in the system. Never showed up once for custody. He has 3 other kids, twin boys (11) and a daughter about 9 now that he has 0 contact with. The twins he sees about the same as mine since he gets them together so they can spend time together it is really so they can just watch my son and entertain him. ",0.0,-0.0032008334528654814,0,1
83,1do9cy9,AITA for not being open about taking birth control pills to my parents,"I (F, 17) have been taking pills for almost a month now. I have been with my boyfriend for 3 months now and we both decided that we didn‚Äôt want any risk of pregnancy thus we use all safety measures of protection possible. 

My mom (F, 44) went through my bag while i was asleep and found my pills as well as went through my laptop and read all my messages with my boyfriend, my boyfriend‚Äôs mom and all my friends (basically everyone in my recent messages). 

Today, when i got home, she confronted me about it but would not let me explain my side, they think im too young to be doing things like this and gave me an ultimatum to break up with my boyfriend.

For context, i turn 18 in 3 months.

I have talked to my boyfriend about this and we both agree that we do not want to leave each other over something like this. We believe we‚Äôve done nothing wrong but make sure that we dont have any accidents. 

Additionally, my mother currently thinks i could be pregnant due to one message she read with my friend about how i haven‚Äôt had my period yet (which i‚Äôve assumed is because this is my first month taking pills). 

AITA?

Edit #1: I live in the Philippines and SexEd is not commonly talked about much with teens. My mom (and a lot of my aunts and relatives) went through teenage pregnancy and based on how she talked to me earlier, she doesn‚Äôt want me to go through the same thing. She has given me 1 week to break up with my boyfriend or she would kick me out of the house and after talking it out with my bf, we both decided not to break up and instead keep our relationship on the low just until i officially turn 18. Some might think that a 3 month relationship is not worth the risk especially because we‚Äôre both still young and we‚Äôre each other‚Äôs first relationship however, in the 3 months we‚Äôve been together we‚Äôve been a healthy and strong couple that this issue is actually the only thing thats come between us right now. I am also fortunate enough to find someone like him who has a understanding and accepting family who actually loves and appreciates me as one of their own (bit of context, i graduated high school recently and will be entering uni in a few weeks and my bf and his family were the only ones that gave me gifts and celebrated my achievements with me through dinner, i am also a straight A student and have never failed to make it to the honors list each year) so him and his family are really people worth fighting for.

84,1do96zw,AITA for not attending my friend‚Äôs sister‚Äôs betrothal because my dog was sick?,"My bestfriend (23F) and me (23F) have been friends for a good 2 years now. We clicked instantly and have been there for each other ever since. I am close with her family and she is close with mine. We usually visit and stay at each other‚Äôs places when the both of us are not busy. Anyway, in our culture, there is an engagement that takes place, then a betrothal, then a marriage. All these are usually celebrated like an event and there are many customs to be followed. So her sister was engaged a few months back and I was there a week prior and took part in everything from organizing, setting things n everything. Her close family (aunts, uncles, cousins) were all in and out of the house and hence everyone knew me that way. So after the engagement party, she did tell me that her family liked me a lot and they told her how good of a friend i was and she is grateful for that. Now after the engagement there is a tiny betrothal that happens which is usually a custom that is given less significance but people do it just for the sake of it. Only close families are invited to the betrothal. She decided to invite me too. As a friend, I accepted the invitation. However, the date arrived and my dog got absolutely sick the night prior and i had to take her to the vet in the morning cause it was serious. Well serious as in she lost balance to her hind legs suddenly and was all shaky when she tried to get up. She is our family dog. Due to this, i had to cancel. So I texted her (we dont make calls at all), that this was the case and hence i couldnt make it, which i am sorry for. And she sent me, ‚ÄúK‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why but i got angry. She‚Äôs never tried to understand me but she expects me to understand her for the silliest of reasons. Anyway, i decided to gulp the anger thinking she was probably busy or something. The wedding is a upcoming in about two weeks. She usually sends me updates or texts me random things but she has been silent ever since. So i decided to sent her a text asking how she was and how things are. She left me on read. Now there is nothing else that she could be pissed at me for because i know small things like this matter a lot to her but i expected her to understand my situation too. 

Please do ask me if you have any questions or you want me to fill in on details.

NOTE: I‚Äôd like to clarify since a lot of people are talking about this. I sent her a text because that is what we have been doing since the beginning of our friendship.

85,1do94r3,AITA for refusing to refund my ex best friend for her concert ticket?,"I (20F), asked 5 of my close friends if they wanted to go to a concert with me. Everyone, including my best friend of 6+ years/college roommate, was super excited to go. Since I had initiated the whole thing, I decided to purchase all 6 tickets together and keep them (electronically) until the day of the concert. Each of my friends venmoed me for their ticket (about $70 each) and that was that. 

Between the time that the tickets were purchased and the day of the concert, my best friend/college roommate ‚ÄúRachel‚Äù and I had stopped being friends. Rooming together didn‚Äôt work out for us (cliche, I know). I had been feeling super abandoned by her for a while, she would leave for days at a time to stay with her girlfriend without ever telling me where she was going or when she would be coming back. She made no effort to spend any time with me and when I confronted her about how I was feeling, she didn‚Äôt seem to care and absolutely nothing changed. Eventually, we decided not to room together for the upcoming semester after having a serious blowout fight, and we hadn‚Äôt spoken since. 

Obviously, as the day of the concert approached, Rachel‚Äôs concert ticket was on my mind. I figured that it was just a matter of time before I got a message from her asking for her ticket. But in the meantime, my friend ‚ÄúEthan‚Äù asked if he could go to the concert with us in place of Rachel since I still had her ticket. I told him that the ticket would be his until the moment that Rachel asked me for it. However, I still hadn‚Äôt heard anything from her when the night of the concert rolled around, so I gave Ethan her ticket and the 6 of us went to the concert and had a great time. 

As we were leaving the stadium (5 minutes after the concert had ended) I got a venmo request from Rachel for $70 that said ‚Äúconcert ticket ;)‚Äù I was fuming. I declined the request and texted her personally saying ‚ÄúIf you would have texted me before the concert, I would‚Äôve given you the ticket so that you could sell it or get it refunded on your own. I‚Äôm not giving you $70 that would now come out of my own pocket because you forgot to ask for your ticket.‚Äù Her response basically insinuated that since I had bought the tickets, I should‚Äôve reached out to her and offered her the ticket as it‚Äôs ‚Äúcommon decency‚Äù and that she doesn‚Äôt care about the money, only the ‚Äúprinciple of the situation since we were best friends for years.‚Äù 
I stuck to my guns and didn‚Äôt pay her the $70. I just don‚Äôt think I owed it to her to go out of my way to reach out and make sure she got her ticket. Especially when, in my eyes, she is the one that caused the downfall of our friendship. She had almost 3 months to message me, but chose to wait until the second the concert was over to ask for her money back. 
This situation happened about a year ago, but I still think about it every once in a while and feel a bit guilty even though I truly do believe I did the right thing. Honestly just looking for some outsiders‚Äô perspective. So, AITA?

She said there will always be a place for me in her home if I need it also.

I (F25) live at home with my Mum (F55) and disabled brother (M28).

My bf (M25) recently graduated from a masters degree and is desperately seeking work but can‚Äôt find a job yet. His parents (F48 and M48) recently bought a house in the countryside that has an outdoor annexe with a kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom etc. My bf will be living in that annexe rent free, and him and his family have told me that I‚Äôm more than welcome to live there with him if we want to experience having our own place/ cooking meals together etc whilst saving up to buy our first house. We‚Äôve been together 5 years, and being able to experience living together independently without paying rent seemed like a nice idea, but I wasn‚Äôt sure about the idea of leaving my own family home to do that. I feel pretty hesitant because it‚Äôs really helpful for my Mum having me around to help out with my brother, and I‚Äôm also her main source of emotional support. My dad looks after my brother 5 hours a day, but him and my Mum are separated so he doesn‚Äôt live at home, so moving out would leave my Mum and brother alone mainly. 

I mentioned the idea of the moving out briefly to my Mum and she totally freaked out. She basically said that because my bfs family are wealthier that they‚Äôre taking away her daughter, and that her and my brother need me for support. She said it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if we were buying our own place, but that me moving in where his family are feels like me abandoning her and that it‚Äôs too soon. I‚Äôve said that I‚Äôd regularly come round to help out, and that this is hypothetical anyway as I haven‚Äôt decided what I want to do,  but she really doesn‚Äôt want it to happen. Neither my Mum or my Dad understand why I‚Äôd want to move into the annexe, but I‚Äôve said that it‚Äôs just nice to be able to experience living with the person I love while we can‚Äôt afford our own place, and experiencing a little bit more independence, plus our home has a lot of issues with black mould and is cluttered (hoarding family) so I can never have people round much, so a cleaner environment would be nice. I honestly am still not sure what I want to do, but my Mum‚Äôs reaction has made me feel like she possibly has an unhealthy dependence on me that makes me want to withdraw a bit. But then another part of me thinks that‚Äôs just me being very selfish- she‚Äôs a very loving Mum. So, what do you guys think? I need some guidance.

- I‚Äôm not a carer for my brother, but I do help out with things like meals etc and I think it‚Äôs mainly having me there as a friend that she would miss the most. (She can‚Äôt see her friends much due to being a carer.)

90,1do8gl9,WIBTA if I addressed my brother about my concerns about his relationship with his girlfriend before he proposes to her?,"

My brother (30M) and I (31M) are pretty close despite our busy schedules. He is doing his medical residency, so his time is limited. He has been dating his girlfriend for year and a half. I am cordial with his girlfriend, but we're not close.

My brother is financially limited due to his residency. For the last few months, my brother has not been able to pay his rent, which he should be able to. My brother has asked me for a loan to pay his rent. I have loaned my brother almost $6000 in last three months. About a few months ago, my brother told me he used the money I had loaned him for rent to go on a vacation that his girlfriend planned. His girlfriend made him pay for the entire trip, which was a couple of thousand dollars. I was furious at my brother because I didn't loan him the money for this purpose. I told my brother that he needs to pay me back but to this day I have not been paid back.

About a month ago, my dad told me my brother's girlfriend called him and my mom to complain about me. My brother's girlfriend told my parents that I didn't treat her warmly during Thanksgiving and New Years. That was surprising to me because I greeted her kindly during Thanksgiving and New Years' celebration at my parents' house. She told my parents that had an issue with me interacting with my youngest brother. She wanted me to interact with her more. She also made an insulting and judgmental remark to my parents about their parenting skills. My parents and I were offended by that statement. This isn't the first time that she has made remarks like this. 

A couple of months ago, she made a remark to me that my brother didn't come from a good family, and her family supported and helped my brother to achieve his medical school goal. My parents and I took offense to it. I played it off and told her that we have always been supportive of my brother's achievements. 

I told my brother what she said about our parents and myself, and he disregarded my issues. He doesn't think she has done anything wrong. I have told my brother that I am still getting to know his girlfriend, but I don't like the offensive remarks she makes about our family. 

Yesterday, my brother called me to tell me that he is proposing to his girlfriend next month. I told my brother that I want him to be happy and if he is happy then I am happy. That‚Äôs is truth; however, myself and my parents are not excited about it. We have concerns. Personally, I think that my brother is making a mistake proposing to his girlfriend but I can‚Äôt say that to him. My brother wants my parents and I to meet with him to discuss his plans to propose. He told us he wants to hear our honest opinions. WIBTA if I told him my opinions about his plans to propose?

92,1do8b79,AITA for potentially not going to my friend‚Äôs birthday trip because she is unwilling to compromise?  ,"My friend is going on a trip somewhere with her family and best friend however due to unforeseen circumstances her best friend is no longer going. She explained this to us and said because of this the trip would be so expensive because she would have to pay for most of the accommodation on her own which was causing her stress. 

Because she's my friend, I said I may be able to go on the trip if it's within a VERY strict budget and I can work aboard since I don't have the annual leave to cover the entire trip and already have a holiday booked close to the time of her holiday.  Her other friend who we with us agreed to go as well. I had only met that friend that day so I don‚Äôt know her that well.

Further down the line, she had said that we could no longer stay with her family because of certain reasons so me and her friend would have to look for our own accommodation and that accommodation had to be within walking distance of hers. I was not happy with this but ultimately said I could see what I could do. 

The location of this trip is VERY expensive and a small island so having even more restricted accommodation did not help with the cost at all. 

Ultimately, I had said that I could still go but I could not go for the entire trip and that the only way I could go was to miss the first two days as this would lead the reduced accommodation costs and the flights those days were much less than the days she picked. 

She said this was not an option for her as I would be late on her birthday and she wanted me to be there for the entire day. She said that this is not something she is willing to compromise on and it's not worth me going at all if I'm not there for the full day of her birthday.

AITA for thinking she's very selfish and unreasonable right now? Because I think I've been very fair and flexible thus far. That fact am I willing to work half the time I'm there, spending a chuck of money that I wasn't expecting to and travel over 8 hours just to be there for her, just for her not to compromise on that fact that I would be landing on her birthday. So I would get to see her on her birthday and hang out but not for the full day. 

Currently, I'm thinking of not going altogether because I'm not willing to spend extra money for approximately half a day especially with me having my own holiday to worry about shortly after.

93,1do7spp,"AITA for not ""spying"" on my friends Ex for her and also continuing to be friends with him? ","I (28F) have known Kerry (27F) for about a year and I'd say we're close friends. We hang out about twice a week. She and her long term boyfriend Blake (33) of 6 years broke up about 6 months ago and she has since started seeing someone new. We met while gaming online but about 6 months ago she and her ex moved back to my city since their jobs went remote. 

Blake and I hung out a few times while Kerry and Blake were still dating but never 1 on 1. During a hangout after they had broken up, he mentioned he wanted to start lifting. I am very into lifting and offered to help him out. I asked Kerry if she was fine with this arrangement and she said she was as long as there was an end date. For context, this made sense as Blake was subletting at the time and so would move from a gym that was convenient for both of us. 

However, we ended up meeting another guy at the gym (Virgil) and all three of us have become friends. Blake extended his sublet as well. During this time, Kerry has always been pressuring me to tell me about Blake's love life. I have always managed to dodge her questions though but have told her some info about a new woman he is seeing. 

Recently, Kerry found out I was hanging with Blake just 1 on 1 while lifting and freaked the hell out. She is now giving me an ultimatum of either drop Blake or tell me all the details about his love life. She is claiming that she has had an issue this whole time and that she hasn't said anything since we've been hanging with the Virgil but has been extremely bothered by the pictures we've been posting together on instagram and that Virgil's girlfriend is also pissed about me being closed to Virgil. 

She thought that I would abide by girl code and give me all the tea about Blake's love life and that if she knew that we'd be any more than lifting friends she would have never agreed to being okay in the first place. 

My view is that both Blake and Kerry are my friends and I should be allowed to be friends with both. I never meant to get close to Blake but it just happened and we're completely platonic. I also think that she should just focus on her new relationship anyway and why does it matter that Blake is dating someone when she has a boyfriend anyway. So am I the asshole for saying no?

We‚Äôve been living together for over a year but she works 6 days a week as a server and I work from home as a customer service representative. We both live in her mom‚Äôs basement and we‚Äôre both working towards moving out into a place of her own. It‚Äôs a finished basement and it has a kitchen and a living space, however the lay out is similar to a studio apartment. If i wanted to make breakfast, Tanya would wake up from the noise. 

She is NOT a morning person. She would get in her worst moods when she is woken up or if she‚Äôs trying to sleep at night. She takes her sleep seriously.

Recently, Tanya told me that we need to figure out different sleeping arrangements because she cannot sleep next to me everytime she has work the next day. Tanya suggests that i sleep in her mom‚Äôs guest bedroom, and that i make myself a breakfast nook for me to make my breakfast.not only do I crave the intimacy by sleeping next to someone, I don‚Äôt like sleeping in her guest bedroom. Her cat is all over the bed and since i‚Äôm allergic, I always get a stuffy nose before and while i‚Äôm sleeping. Her mom also makes smoothies in the morning and heats up a tea kettle, making a ton of noise. Also the curtains doesn‚Äôt block any sunlight so I‚Äôm immediately woken up at the crack of dawn. Plus I work in the guest bedroom and i don‚Äôt want to eat where i shit. Those reasons alone prove that my sleep is impacted by this arrangement. 

So i did some thinking and I thought that maybe if she truly cannot sleep next to me before she has work and that she wants me to seclude myself to a part of the house and make my own space, I might as well move out. I used to live with my brother, who lives literally 3 minutes away. I could live there for the time being and when we are ready to get place of our own, we can live together again. 

Tanya hated that idea. Granted we would get in fights about our living space and I would threaten to move out and not actually do it. I‚Äôve learned that it creates a lot of hurt and it‚Äôs low key manipulative so i told her i wouldn‚Äôt do it again. 

This time, i have put a lot of thought into this and I want to her to get as much sleep as she needs. However, it can‚Äôt be at my expense. I have work too, I even act in a short film with an aspiring director here in town. Working for free and late into the AM most of the times. i feel like i‚Äôve already made compromises in the past and I don‚Äôt like when she gets bitter in the morning because it puts me in a bad mood.

96,1do7bu0,AITA for not cancelling plans with friends?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for just over 3 years. I live in the UK and most of my friends from university live in different parts of the country so we barely get to meet up. A couple of us met in June last year but apart from that it has been nearly 2 years. We have been talking and trying to arrange something soon.

We have agreed on the a weekend in July as we're all free then and some of them are already near me anyway around that time due to work. We're meeting up in a city not too far from me and I'll be staying over for 2 nights.

My girlfriends family tends to meet up twice a year for a meal and drinks. It's quite casual, we just go to a pub and have a meal and drinks etc. My girlfriends mum mentioned to her that they were planning to meet up in July and told her the weekend.

My girlfriend mentioned this to me and I apologised but said I wouldn't be able to make it due to it being the same weekend I'm seeing friends. I explained that my friends are only going to be up for that weekend so we can't rearrange.

I asked if it was possible for her family to meet the following week if she wanted me there but she said it isn't. I apologised again and just said that while I wish I could go, it's been nearly 2 years since we've all managed to meet up so I can't cancel on my friends.

She accused me of not prioritising us and said I should explain to my friends why I can't make it but I said I wouldn't be doing that. She said she's not asking for much and that I should be at her family meal since she should be my priority. 

I tried explaining that doesn't mean me cancelling plans I've already made with people I barely see.

He litters and leaves tools everywhere. Toxic bug sprays have been discarded in our plant area. Lately, he's been mowing the lawn every day.  Literally.  He moves his army of grills around, and has been moving them into our garden (on top of our strawberries...).

Should I have just bitten my tongue and moved the grill/offending item ((again))?

99,1do6b4s,AITA For Not Telling My Sister a Happy Mother's Day,"I (27F) have been in a conflict with my middle sister (28F) for over a month. We haven't spoken since the incident, and it seems to be escalating. My oldest sister (30F) and I didn't tell our middle sister Happy Mother's Day. This wasn't intentional or meant to be mean, and it wasn't her first Mother's Day. It just slipped our minds because we live far away. I usually only tell my mom and MIL Happy Mother's Day. I spent the entire day with my MIL at a baseball game, and she wanted us to be present and off our phones.

The next day, our mom called to tell me that my middle sister felt hurt that she didn't hear from us. At first, I thought it was silly to be upset over an oversight, but I explained it wasn't intentional or malicious. My middle sister texted our group chat as if nothing was wrong and didn't mention her hurt feelings. We were talking about mundane things, so I thought it must not be a big deal.

On Tuesday, my oldest sister needed help with a serious issue involving her FIL. I spent most of the day assisting her and hadn't heard from our middle sister, assuming she was busy. Our middle sister never responded to help & sent a random picture of her dog. My oldest sister jokingly commented, ""Oh thanks for not responding btw,"" and our middle sister used that to express her being upset. She said, ""I could respond hatefully, but I won't."" I thought it was inappropriate to bring up her feelings during a serious situation, especially when she could've mentioned it earlier. I joked, saying, ""You are not my momma,"" and ""Well, you didn't tell me Happy Mother's Day either (I have a dog)."" She called me a b\*\*\*\*, and that was the end of it. I know I shouldn't have joked, but I was angry and use humor to express my feelings. I wouldn't have joked if she had expressed her feelings appropriately.

A week later, she posted on Facebook about my nephew getting tests for his ears. I texted her that he was strong and that I loved him. She didn't respond. My birthday was in early June, and she didn't reach out personally, only commenting ""Happy Birthday"" on my mom's Facebook post. Then she posted on Facebook asking if people expect their siblings to tell them Happy Mother's/Father's Day, airing our dirty laundry publicly. Multiple friends screenshot the post and asked what was going on. This seems unnecessary, considering I haven't spoken to her since I reached out about my nephew.

My middle sister claims it's about appreciation, not validation. I feel it's about validation because why else hold onto this for so long? I love my nephew and have been there for all his major life events and visited as much as I can. My sister is a good mother, but I don't think it's my responsibility to validate her as a mom.

I (F29) started learning Spanish three years ago. I am not fluent by any means, as I have very little time to learn and no talent for languages, but I reached the level where I am able to have basic conversations. Ever since then I dreamed about going to Spain on vacations to train/test my language skills.

At last I had enough money to go, so I went for a two weeks trip with my boyfriend (M30) and his brother (M33). All the three of us know English more or less fluently, but only I know a bit of Spanish. Obviously, I wanted to communicate in Spanish as much as possible and kept talking in this language at hotel, shops, restaurant etc. I even managed to make some small talks, even if at times I was using more Spaglish than real Spanish. I was quite proud of myself.

However, both my boyfriend and his brother were somewhat upset with me using Spanish, especially during these small talks (I WAS translating to them what we are talking about and - as much as it was possible to me - translated their inputs in convos). They said that they were feeling awkward and worried that I may try to ridicule or badmouth them in Spanish. I would never do anything like that and I've no history of humiliating other people. Also, I definitely wasn't flirting and outside of ""official"" conversations (i.e. hotel, restaurant) was only talking with women or mixed groups of people. 

With every day it was getting worse, to the point where they said that if possible I should only talk in English, so they would understand what I am talking about. I refused, as the whole point of this trip for me was to hone my skills. They say that I'm inconsiderate and just want to show off.

103,1do529t,AITA for giving hints to a girl instead of being direct? ,"_[English is not my first language, sorry in advance]_

I (m29) met this girl (26) at our local gym. We‚Äôd been gym buddies for months, and at the beginning of this year we started liking each other. 

One night, I invited her over to my place. She clarified that she wasn‚Äôt looking for a hookup, and asked about my intentions before agreeing (or not) to come to my place. I told her I wanted to get to know her better. I was honestly not sure about wanting something serious yet, and I know I should‚Äôve probably said that instead. 

We had dinner, we kissed, and then I felt as if I was leading her on. I really liked her, but it felt wrong. So the following day, I ended it through text. I told her I didn‚Äôt have space for a relationship. We kept being gym buddies, though the first couple of weeks were a little awkward. 

A month later, I invited her to go out and do something during the weekend. I thought maybe her feelings for me were gone now? I wanted to hang out as friends. But she thought I was asking her out on a date, so I pulled away and didn‚Äôt mention the invitation again in hopes she would forget. She then tried to schedule the ‚Äúdate‚Äù - idk why but I felt bad for her, so I agreed to go for a coffee. Couple of days later, I saw her at the gym but barely talked to her. I didn‚Äôt want to give her false hope. 

She then texted me and asked if I wanted to go out again. I said yes because I didn‚Äôt have plans for the weekend and I enjoyed her company, but again I felt like an AH and didn‚Äôt reply to her following messages for weeks. I went on holidays, and when I returned (to the gym), she was incredibly cold.

I (m29) met this girl (26) at our local gym. We‚Äôd been gym buddies for months, and at the beginning of this year we started liking each other. 

One night, I invited her over to my place. She clarified that she wasn‚Äôt looking for a hookup, and asked about my intentions before agreeing (or not) to come to my place. I told her I wanted to get to know her better. I was honestly not sure about wanting something serious yet, and I know I should‚Äôve probably said that instead. 

We had dinner, we kissed, and then I felt as if I was leading her on. I really liked her, but it felt wrong. So the following day, I ended it through text. I told her I didn‚Äôt have space for a relationship. We kept being gym buddies, though the first couple of weeks were a little awkward. 

A month later, I invited her to go out and do something during the weekend. I thought maybe her feelings for me were gone now? I wanted to hang out as friends. But she thought I was asking her out on a date, so I pulled away and didn‚Äôt mention the invitation again in hopes she would forget. She then tried to schedule the ‚Äúdate‚Äù - idk why but I felt bad for her, so I agreed to go for a coffee. Couple of days later, I saw her at the gym but barely talked to her. I didn‚Äôt want to give her false hope. 

She then texted me and asked if I wanted to go out again. I said yes because I didn‚Äôt have plans for the weekend and I enjoyed her company, but again I felt like an AH and didn‚Äôt reply to her following messages for weeks. I went on holidays, and when I returned (to the gym), she was incredibly cold. 

I told her I didn‚Äôt have time for a relationship, right? Most women would take that as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in one rn‚Äù, but she didn‚Äôt. And then she confused my invitation to hang out for a date. I know I should‚Äôve been a bit more communicative, but people also don‚Äôt know how to take hints anymore.

104,1do4ogv,AITA for telling my roomates I‚Äôm only paying 1/4 of the rent+utilities going forward ,"So I‚Äôve lived with my roomates for 4 years now and we‚Äôve always split bills by the # of people not space taken up and in April of 2023 they welcomed their daughter into this world whom I was in the room to watch be delivered. Since then, our electric has steadily increased and the baby has gotten her own room. Therefore in my mind they‚Äôre occupying more of the house #1, and #2 using more electricity for the baby whether it be heating tons of water, or putting on Ms Rachel for hours as examples. Recently (within the last 3 days) I felt comfortable enough to talk to them about it and told them it would be fair if they paid 3/4 of rent and utilities as they are 3 people now and I‚Äôm only 1. They reacted by saying I‚Äôm being selfish, I‚Äôm in denial, and that I‚Äôm dead to them and the most too faced person they‚Äôve ever met. To top it all off they told me I must not love their daughter and that the way I view it just isn‚Äôt the way they see it. My boyfriend also spends the night frequently but is only at the house when I‚Äôm there meaning when I get home I tell him to come over and when I leave he leaves to not disrupt the household as he doesn‚Äôt live there. AITA?


Edit

Q&A 1.	Increased Usage: The presence of a newborn undeniably increases household utility usage. The need for heating, cooling, laundry, and other baby-related utilities contributes significantly to the increase in electricity bills. 2.	Occupancy: With the baby occupying her own room and additional space for baby-related activities, it‚Äôs reasonable to say that your roommates are using more of the household resources.

My request for them to pay 3/4 of the rent and utilities is based on the principle that they are now a family of three, compared to me  being a single occupant. It can be seen as logical because: 1.	Proportional Share: Splitting the costs based on the number of people can be fair, as more occupants generally use more resources. 2.	Increased Expenses: The increase in utility usage due to the baby is a direct consequence of their growing family, not your usage patterns.

Their reaction seems emotionally charged, which might be due to several factors:

1.	Sensitivity: New parents can be very protective and sensitive about their child and any perceived criticism or inconvenience related to the baby.
2.	Perception of Fairness: They might see the arrangement differently, believing that the household costs should not change because they view the baby as part of their family unit rather than an additional occupant.

My Boyfriend‚Äôs Presence

My boyfriend staying over frequently could be seen as adding to the household usage. However, his usage and presence is limited overall and he contributes by bringing food and minimizing disruption, which I think might mitigate any substantial impact on utilities. Him being over as well is not impacting the way they live as they‚Äôre usually in bed by the time I get there and then invite my boyfriend over. Is he  freeloading when I‚Äôm the one that invites him over every time because I genuinely want him over. I thought freeloading was like done with malice. overall I get the point of view but they said he‚Äôs always welcome over after I asked for the 3rd  time if he could and made a point to tell me I don‚Äôt have to ask and on top of it all he brings food over for all of us without asking which helps with our grocery bill overall which should subsidize the utility usage.

This person I‚Äôve known through high school and they were fine at the time. They had some mental baggage but as do the rest of us‚Ä¶it‚Äôs high school. 
Anyways, we used to be in a freiend group of 4 but in recent years we all kinda split. 
Onetime 3 of us decided not to be friends with this person anymore because all they would do is trauma dump. I‚Äôm fine with trauma dumping when you need to because I get it. But every convo, even when I‚Äôm sharing about my issues it just gets hard. They‚Äôve said that‚Äôs how they show they relate and understand but this is a whole different level. Some time after, I healed a bit in myself and thought, eh, I can still be friends with this person so I reached out to them. Now the friend group wasn‚Äôt back together but I was sorta in the middle. I‚Äôve been able to tolerate the way they do things but in recent months I remembered why I don‚Äôt really want to be friends with them. 
I know some will say ‚Äújust stop being friends with them‚Äù but after leaving once before, now feels twice as hard cuz I would now be doing it twice.

I forgot to mention that a while ago when I decided I don‚Äôt wanna be friends with them again, I thought I should try to be distant so that they‚Äôll think they don‚Äôt want to be friends with me so that it will be easier for me to leave. 

Ive also thought about contacting them saying something along the lines of ‚Äúlisten, I have a bunch going on and it seems like our connection is quite thin.

114,1do1zqs,AITA for telling my parents they need to learn to live without me?,"My parents have a lot of kids. They always wanted a big family and were not prepared for how hard that would be. I'm (17m) the oldest of 10 and my parents have relied on me for so long that I don't remember a time where I wasn't treated like a third adult in the house. My siblings range from 15 down to 4. My parents are still technically able to have more kids too because neither are 40 yet and it scares me, I won't lie. We already struggle so much with 10 of us and I know it would be worse if they added more, especially when I'm so close to moving out.

In our house we have a boys room, a girls room and our parents bedroom. We basically all sleep on these tiny ass bunkbeds in order to fit everyone in. Nobody gets brand new clothes it all thrift store for me and the oldest of my sisters and our younger brothers and sisters get our hand me downs.

It was expected I would step up by the time I was 5. I had to make mine and my siblings beds, had to tidy up after younger siblings, had to stop my younger siblings from climbing onto things and I was also expected to clean the floors. Over time more chores were added to my list. Helping to cook, babysitting (even when I was too young really), helping with homework, holding siblings hands when we went grocery shopping so they wouldn't run off. Cleaning the bathrooms. Cleaning both boys and girls bedrooms. Tidying up if we were having guests (especially if anyone had friends over). My siblings weren't really given chores. And I was basically doing just as much as my parents around the house.

My siblings rely on me for too much. From driving them places to picking them up from places, to giving them permission for stuff (my parents let me give permission where I know they would). They expect me to buy them stuff. They come to me more than our parents and sometimes come to me after our parents if they don't like what our parents said. They get pissy whenever I try to get them to help out and our parents won't back me up so they have never done any kind of chore or helped out at all. They get so mad when I ask they say I'm not mom and dad but then they also won't go to mom and dad for this shit most of the time.

My parents started freaking out because I'll be 18 in October and they know I plan to move out. I also work part time and that gets relied on to help financially and between that and all I do around the house, it finally dawned on my parents I won't be around in a few more months. They started word vomiting all this on me and I told them they need to learn to live without me because it's not my job to be the third adult in the house anymore. They told me I'll still be a part of the family and I can't just abandon them. I said I will not support the household after I turn 18 because it won't be my job.

Anyway, my dad and I do not speak so my tradition on father‚Äôs day was to hang out with my ex, even before we were together as we‚Äôve always known eachother growing up. Even though we‚Äôre splitting, he‚Äôs been insistent on taking me out this father‚Äôs day since he‚Äôs going to be a father this years and he considers it his first father‚Äôs day.

The issue here is, he still had feelings for me and he wants me to take him back and every time i try to see him (for doctors appointments or lawyer meetings) he begs me to take him back and it‚Äôs just not nice. 

I told him a few times (like 10+) that I was not going to see him this father‚Äôs day because my family have started a tradition of doing a big family cookout for father‚Äôs day.

Eventually, I got the message he wasn‚Äôt taking no for an answer no matter how many times and ways I said no. I lied and told him that the cookout was actually going to be held 3 hours away at my uncles ranch and he said bet i‚Äôll drive over in the evening to see you. This was the night before father‚Äôs day so my hands were tired. This is where i may be the AH.

I waited till morning and then said that I had vomited so much the night before that my mom took me to the hospital and I was being treated for dehydration. I said it was a minor issue but I was going to be kept all day and I couldn‚Äôt make it. My brother was in on it and volunteered to the person who kept him updated all day on my condition.

Turns out, he wasn‚Äôt happy with that so he drove down to the town where i said i was going to be and went to the local hospital and asked to see me. Obviously, he found out I lied and he‚Äôs extremely pissed at me.

My ex in laws that i still get along with are so mad at me and want me to apologize for wasting his time. I don‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt anything wrong because he would not take no for an answer but they have said that i should‚Äôve known how much he cares about me and not lied about being in hospital, no matter how minor the fake illness was.

I lied and told him that the cookout was actually going to be held 3 hours away at my uncles ranch and he said bet i‚Äôll drive over in the evening to see you. This was the night before father‚Äôs day so my hands were tired. This is where i may be the AH.

I waited till morning and then said that I had vomited so much the night before that my mom took me to the hospital and I was being treated for dehydration. I said it was a minor issue but I was going to be kept all day and I couldn‚Äôt make it. My brother was in on it and volunteered to the person who kept him updated all day on my condition.

Turns out, he wasn‚Äôt happy with that so he drove down to the town where i said i was going to be and went to the local hospital and asked to see me. Obviously, he found out I lied and he‚Äôs extremely pissed at me.

My ex in laws that i still get along with are so mad at me and want me to apologize for wasting his time. I don‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt anything wrong because he would not take no for an answer but they have said that i should‚Äôve known how much he cares about me and not lied about being in hospital, no matter how minor the fake illness was.

119,1do1gex,AITA for not inviting my friend‚Äôs boyfriend on a group holiday because he makes it obvious he hates me? ,"Throwaway because family is on my main. 

My friends and I are planning a trip to my dad‚Äôs holiday home in august. It‚Äôll be 7 of us total. It would be 8, but I‚Äôve decided not to invite my friend ‚ÄúKara‚Äù‚Äòs boyfriend ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù, because every time I see him he makes it blatantly obvious he doesn‚Äôt like me. 

Since I met him about a year ago, he has been awkward and standoffish with me in a way he isn‚Äôt towards our other friends. I have really tried to make conversation with him but everything I do seems to offend or annoy him. He avoids me like the plague in group settings, rolls his eyes at everything I say, and only gives monosyllabic answers to anything I ask him. I‚Äôve given up trying to be his friend but he can‚Äôt even be polite and it‚Äôs annoying. I get that not everyone is going to like you in life but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any need to be rude. 

(I have asked Kara what I did to upset him but she denies there‚Äôs a problem. She just says he‚Äôs an awkward person and probably just doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable around me) 

Anyway, I just can‚Äôt be bothered to spend ten days hosting someone who can‚Äôt even manage to say hello to me. So I told Kara that the invite didn‚Äôt extend to Alex. She‚Äôs pissed. She said he‚Äôd be really hurt by that and that it‚Äôs disrespectful to her relationship. I said Alex is disrespectful to me and I don‚Äôt have to put up with that in my family‚Äôs house. She put it to the group and 2 people sided with her but I said we can all pick a neutral location to stay if they want Alex to come so badly, and that shit everyone up because the cost of staying in that area in the summer is astronomical. Kara is calling me a tyrant, and I guess I kind of am, but I think I‚Äôm justified. No, Alex is not outright cruel to me but he‚Äôs hostile, so why do I have to put him up? 

I know Kara is complaining to our other friends about the issue and how she doesn‚Äôt want to go now that Alex is excluded. I don‚Äôt want this kind of drama but after I‚Äôve been the only one acknowledging the problem, I think I have to stand my ground here. Should I just let him come?

121,1do0wxn,AITA for threatening to cancel a trip because I didn't want to travel alone? ,"
I was invited to do a panel at a con at the other side of my country, it's around 4-5 hours drive each way, so I asked my friend if she wanted to come too as I didn't really want to make the trip myself and even got her a spot on the panel as well. 

A few months later the con was approaching fast and I had asked a few times what we were going to do about accommodation but I never really got a response, which isn't unusual as her organisational skills aren't great. She did mention though that some of her other friends might be coming to it as well to see her on the panel, I said that's great and mentioned there would be room in my car if they needed a lift as I know very few drove.

2 weeks before the con I chased her up again because nothing was booked and she told me that she was going to book an Airbnb for her and 5 friends, I asked if there was space for me and she said no, the room they were looking at was only up to 5, and when I asked about them looking at other options I was told they were pretty set on that one. She also told me that her room mate was going to drive them over so she wouldn't need a lift. 

I told her I was pretty annoyed by that since the original plan was made because I didn't want to travel alone, and asked if there was space for me in their car and she said no, but if her roommate's friend's boyfriend decided he didn't want to go, there may be room then, but she would need to check if another roommate wanted to go first. This made me even more annoyed because they wouldn't be going at all if I hadn't made the original plans and accomodation was looking at being around 300$ now which I didn't want to spend on my own.

I said I didn't know if I wanted to go anymore but I was just told ""we are all adults, we are not responsible for each others travel plans, you can sort yourself"" and I was told they could find a replacement for me on the panel if I didn't want to do it. I said to other friends about it as well and it was mixed between some saying I was being an asshole threatening to cancel and it wasn't their responsibility to help me and the panel could be cancelled if I pull out and others agreeing I should have been a higher priority.

Another friend in the other state is going to let me crash with them but I'm still fairly annoyed about the whole thing and tensions are still fairly high about the whole thing.

122,1do04am,AITA for throwing out my girlfriend's fruit?,"This might sound crazy, but here's the deal. My girlfriend, Jamie (29F), is obsessed with fruit. It's great, healthy and all, but she has a habit that's driving me nuts. She cuts up apples, watermelon, whatever, leaves them on the counter all day uncovered. Even worse, she keeps using little cups to ""reuse"" teabags, leaving them out for hours with the tea still in them -  perfect breeding grounds for mold, not to mention a total eyesore.

We already had a fight a few weeks ago because I threw out those used teabags. Apparently, that's a cardinal sin in her world? Now, we have a full-blown fruit fly infestation thanks to her ""fruit platter"" displays. Today's prize? Half a lemon literally crawling with flies, and some apple slices that look like week-old dog treats.

So, trying to be the sanitation hero, I tossed the whole thing. Big mistake. Apparently, throwing out fruit that's become a breeding ground for flies is ""wasting food"" in her eyes. She claims she was gonna eat those fly-covered apples anyway!

Now we're not speaking. I called her out on the flies, but she blew up, accusing me of being wasteful and not respecting her dietary choices. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to use the kitchen anymore. Am I the jerk for wanting a clean kitchen, or is this just the battle you pick when you date someone who uses the counter as a personal fruit orchard with questionable hygiene practices?

127,1dnyiql,AITA for not giving 2 weeks ‚Äúwarning‚Äù,"I‚Äôll try not to make this long..
So at the beginning of the year I was assigned a location to do my externship hours. Everything was unexpectedly great. My boss was cool, my coworkers, and even the patients were cool. There were never really any complaints about anyone or anything working there. 
I progressed rather quickly learning how the office worked and getting patients to trust me with their treatment. I became really good at my job. For once I actually liked my job and didn‚Äôt dread going to work every morning. 
Once I got to the end of my externship, I was not hired on bored immediately because he didn‚Äôt want to pay me to work. A month or so later goes by and at this point he is desperate from all the patient traffic and slow work flow, so I get a call extending an offer for the job. At this point, I‚Äôm excited. I‚Äôm at a job I like, with a boss I like, with coworkers and patients I like too. Everything was good. 
The first thing that my coworkers tell me is that he never pays on time. Like ever. I didn‚Äôt think this was always going to stay an issue, even if we reminded him he takes his time and delays submitting payroll. 
Then this man tells us that he is buying a new building for his practice and just the small four women that work for him will only be getting paid hourly to clean, paint, move equipment (which most was heavy), pack, and still do our regular jobs. Even messed up my mom‚Äôs vehicle when packing wood in her truck and never even as little as apologized. 
(Sorry I know I said I wasn‚Äôt going to make this long)
We‚Äôve been putting in hard labor doing tasks that aren‚Äôt even part of the job description at all that professionals should have been hired for, all for $18 an hour which isn‚Äôt even good pay for the regular day to day work we do. 
We officially move everything into the new office and open. It was taking a while to get use to it and all of a sudden my boss wanted to change some rules. Not a problem. Until he starting messing with my pay.

So at the beginning of the year I was assigned a location to do my externship hours. Everything was unexpectedly great. My boss was cool, my coworkers, and even the patients were cool. There were never really any complaints about anyone or anything working there. 
I progressed rather quickly learning how the office worked and getting patients to trust me with their treatment. I became really good at my job. For once I actually liked my job and didn‚Äôt dread going to work every morning. 
Once I got to the end of my externship, I was not hired on bored immediately because he didn‚Äôt want to pay me to work. A month or so later goes by and at this point he is desperate from all the patient traffic and slow work flow, so I get a call extending an offer for the job. At this point, I‚Äôm excited. I‚Äôm at a job I like, with a boss I like, with coworkers and patients I like too. Everything was good. 
The first thing that my coworkers tell me is that he never pays on time. Like ever. I didn‚Äôt think this was always going to stay an issue, even if we reminded him he takes his time and delays submitting payroll. 
Then this man tells us that he is buying a new building for his practice and just the small four women that work for him will only be getting paid hourly to clean, paint, move equipment (which most was heavy), pack, and still do our regular jobs. Even messed up my mom‚Äôs vehicle when packing wood in her truck and never even as little as apologized. 
(Sorry I know I said I wasn‚Äôt going to make this long)
We‚Äôve been putting in hard labor doing tasks that aren‚Äôt even part of the job description at all that professionals should have been hired for, all for $18 an hour which isn‚Äôt even good pay for the regular day to day work we do. 
We officially move everything into the new office and open. It was taking a while to get use to it and all of a sudden my boss wanted to change some rules. Not a problem. Until he starting messing with my pay. Not just the fact that he doesn‚Äôt pay on time, HE ADMITTED TO ADJUSTING PAYROLL just so he wouldn‚Äôt get flagged for us working the hours we ACTUALLY WORKED when we worked more than 8 hours in a day.

128,1dnygek,AITA for telling me Crazy Ex on her birthday we will never be together?,"Me and my ex Linda had dated for 1 year on and off. We live 25K km apart. We broke up 2x due to long distance. When we got back to Macedonia the 3rd time my friend who is also Linda's brother got me to go to his house. I asked ""Where is Linda?"" He told me she has moved in with her new bf 6 hours away and will be staying permanently. I thought this was great cause there wouldn't be any awkwardness. Fast forward 2 weeks and it was 12pm and still asleep when I got a call frantically being told to go to my mates house.  I got there 45 mins later only to have Linda open the door. We planned to go to coffee that night. I agreed cause it's all 3. I get to the cafe and call to see where they are. I walk in and see Linda there while still on the phone. I told him Linda is there and that he will be there soon. Spoiler, he never did. I sat down and  thought I shouldn't leave her alone at night. I told her I'm interested in someone in Aus and She talked about her BF. I saw a group of girls, and Linda noticed and said ""How dare you look at other girls in front of your GF!"" As she pulled my face towards her to look at her. She said it in a joking sense but I also thought I need to make it known I'm not interested. So I walked up to these girls and introduced myself. Linda yanked my arm and stared at these girls and said ""He's mine!"". I didn't wanna leave her alone as her house was a good 25 mins drive from the city and I was only 5 mins past her house. We sat down again knowing she's crazy. I said I'm off to the bathroom at this point. Didn't mention I was going to call my other mate and get him to get me out of this situation like a 3rd wheel or even some advice. She asked ""Where are you going? Taking your phone so you can cheat on me?"" And I continued walking. My friend couldn't make it. So he suggested I stay another 20 mins, offer to get her a taxi home and be done with it. After I got out the bathroom. She asked me about my car. I'm super proud of it and she wanted to see a photo. So I let her. As she swiped and commented how good it looked she started to giggle. Only then did it occur to me she found my Nudes which were only a few swipes away. I reached for my phone when she pulled it away facing outwards revealing my nude to everyone. I grabbed my phone and left her in the cafe and stormed off. I got home and went to bed. I had alot of texts and calls from her. I called her and immediately  started screaming at the top of my lungs that she is a crazy, money driven bitch and I hope she never finds anyone. This continued for about 10 minutes. My last words were ""There is no chance I would ever get back with you even if you were the last bitch on earth!"" My mum pointed out it was her Birthday and that I was an asshole for saying all of that to her and that I could've made it quick and painless. Needed to cut some bits due to limits. Sorry for the long post.

130,1dny5xp,"AITA for Confronting My Cousin About Being Seated at the ""Singles"" Table at Her Wedding?","Hi everyone,

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Anyway, I'm feeling really conflicted and would love some outside perspective. I (44F) recently attended my younger cousin's wedding. It was a beautiful ceremony and I'm genuinely happy for her. However, something happened at the reception that's been bothering me.

When I arrived, I found that I'd been seated at the ""singles"" table. I was NOT informed of this. I never even heard of something like this but honestly I have not gone to many weddings. 

All of the people at my table were in their 20s and the conversation revolved around dating apps and stories of wild nights out. I felt out of place and somewhat infantilized. It seemed like everyone else, friends, family, couples of all ages had been thoughtfully placed together, while I was lumped in with people who, frankly, have very different life experiences from me.

To add salt to the wound, the table was literally labeled ""SINGLES"" which felt like a glaring spotlight on my marital status. Throughout the evening I found myself repeatedly explaining my life choices and why I'm not married or partnered....it was exhausting and made me feel incredibly self-conscious.

I'm hurt that my cousin, who knows me very well and knows why I prefer to be single, didn't consider how this seating arrangement might affect me. It felt dismissive of my age and accomplishments, as if being single defined my entire identity. I tried to brush it off and enjoy the night, but the whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth, so much that I could not stop thinking about the situation for days.

My therapist encouraged I talk about it with her instead of bottling things up like I normally do so I called my cousin and expressed how hurt I was by the seating arrangement. I told her that it made me feel like an afterthought and that I was disappointed she hadn‚Äôt considered how uncomfortable it might be for me. My cousin was sounding upset and told me she hadn‚Äôt meant to hurt me she was just trying to seat people based on their relationship status to make conversations easier.

Since then, there‚Äôs been some tension between us. The family who know about the situation is also split with some thinking I overreacted and should‚Äôve just enjoyed the wedding, while a few others who know me well, understand why I was upset. 

However, now I‚Äôm feeling conflicted and wondering if I should have just let it go because it was her special day and I feel as if I'm tarnishing a special memory for her.

134,1dnxv71,AITA for making it a problem my co maid of honor is my high school bully,"i‚Äôve been friends with this girls for years and years. a very long time. when we were in high school she was also friends with this other girl we‚Äôll call her M. M was a very nasty and cold hearted person in high school. she fed off making other people‚Äôs lives miserable because hers was. 

it used to be a trend on snapchat to send your group chat a picture of someone and have them say ‚Äúhonest‚Äù things about them. the day of my 16th birthday M took a picture from my social media page and sent it to her group chat and had all her other miserable friends say awful things about me that have stuck with me to this day. it was not the only time she was mean and bullied me but it is the one that has stuck with me years later. 

fast forward to a few months ago, our mutual friend who we‚Äôll call P gets engaged and asks me to be her maid of honor. of course i‚Äôm over the moon and tell her yes because it was something we had both talked about happening for years prior. we were all perfect and everything was going great until a month or so ago when P decided me and M should both be her maid of honor. of course i‚Äôm absolutely heartbroken and hurt because i thought we already had it all set in place, just for them to turn around and be something completely different.

M was a very nasty and cold hearted person in high school. she fed off making other people‚Äôs lives miserable because hers was. 

it used to be a trend on snapchat to send your group chat a picture of someone and have them say ‚Äúhonest‚Äù things about them. the day of my 16th birthday M took a picture from my social media page and sent it to her group chat and had all her other miserable friends say awful things about me that have stuck with me to this day. it was not the only time she was mean and bullied me but it is the one that has stuck with me years later. 

fast forward to a few months ago, our mutual friend who we‚Äôll call P gets engaged and asks me to be her maid of honor. of course i‚Äôm over the moon and tell her yes because it was something we had both talked about happening for years prior. we were all perfect and everything was going great until a month or so ago when P decided me and M should both be her maid of honor. of course i‚Äôm absolutely heartbroken and hurt because i thought we already had it all set in place, just for them to turn around and be something completely different.

135,1dnxrb9,AITA for accidentally outing my (ex) friend over a money's discussion?,"
I [33M] have this (ex)friend [35F] Theresa whos family are huge conservative people, and everything queer related is a sin; they quite love me (I'm Bi), but are clear that everyone else is not welcomed to their house.

Ok, so I loaned her over USD$10K two years ago, she said she will be paying me the very next quarter and up until now, I haven't seen a penny of it. I have loaned her money in the past and she had always payed on time, this is the first (and last) time she hasn't.

At first, she gave me every excuse she could came up with until 6 month later she ghosted me. I considered our friendship over, so I moved on with my life.

Last week her sister invited me and my bf to a friend's gathering (we share few friends), I asked her if her sister will be there and she said she wouldn't since she was on a trip, so we accepted.

We get there all of our friends were there and we were enjoying the night, until Theresa came in. I was astonished, but tried to ignore her. Night went on and she and I got really drunk. By this point her sister came and told me that she lied to me so Theresa and I could fix things between us. I told her it wasn't her business and that the reason why our friendship got broken was her and I wouldn't discuss that while drunk. Theresa started to picked out on me and I told her several times that we were both drunks and we could say something that we could regret later.

Theresa got enraged and start screamed 'don't be hypocrite, I bet everyone knows that you are butt hurt because a little money you loaned me'. I didn't tell a soul that before, not even my bf, so all there got surprises, I corrected her and told that 10k wasn't little money, and that if that was so little she should pay at the moment.

Things escalated quickly and the liquor didn't help any of us until she said 'you haven't done anything for me at all in our 20 years of friendship', and then I listed all the things I had done for her: loaning, gifting, helping her with health bills, helping her getting a job, other stuffs, and 'helping her sneaking with her girlfriends'. Well, her sister didn't know she was a bisexual, so she got out of this world. Theresa looked at me scared of that and all our friends started to get in the middle. My bf excuses us and got me out of it.

Today I received a message from Theresa that her family scolded her pretty hard and that I'm an asshole for outing her. Then she blocked me.

138,1dnx59i,AITA For being angry about not having a bed to sleep,"My family is currently undergoing several transitions

* my mother in the hospital to be discharged soon
* we are spring cleaning the house to ensure a clean environment for her when he is discharged
* we are looking to welcome an addition of a new live-in helper to help to care for my mother

My job requires me to be physically at work the whole day and I would only help out in the evenings with the cleaning and clearing out things. I have taken many unpaid leaves to be at the hospital on the first few days of my mother's hospitalisation and some of my work is time-sensitive so I cannot just take leave as and when. Plus we have hospitalisation bills (my sister and I split half) to pay so I cannot afford to keep taking unpaid leave as I already don't earn a lot compared to my sister. On the other hand, my sister's job is hybrid and her boss actually told her not to take leave and just ""work from home"".

So I was at the hospital with my mother yesterday while my sister does the clearing of the house. (During the major cleaning a few days ago, both of us were in the house to do the clearing) When I head home after the hospital visiting hours ended, I realised there is not a single bed I can sleep in. In my room, the king sized bed is gone and in its place, is a single bed frame (without mattress). My sister has left, she lives with her boyfriend but will be moving back soon. There is only one bed in the house in one of the rooms but that bed has not been touched for almost a year and is full of dust, and that room is stacked with a lot of old but valuable or sentimental things. I was so upset I cried and felt terrible and unwanted in the house. (Backstory, I have always felt like the unwanted child as my sister is the doted one so I guess it was also personal childhood issues on my part.)

I left the family group chats and packed my luggage with basic essentials. Last night, I slept on the sofa and cried myself to sleep. I intended to still go to work today and if I still do not have a bed to sleep tonight, I'll just move out and live on my own, I am ready to sleep on the streets or in the parks. I have not talked to my sister since last night.

One of my relatives who were in the same group chat was closer to me and reached out. She told me I am overreacting. I should be more appreciative that my sister handles the things when I'm at work or in the hospital. Yes, I am grateful that she is able to handle all the things while I am at work but I feel so disrespected and unwanted.

AITA for being angry and leaving the group chats and intending to leave the house?

Edit to add: We are in the midst of changing old furniture and a lot of old things have been thrown out during the major clearing out I did with my sister. The bed has been intended to be thrown out to be replaced but we were waiting for the delivery. There are no clean sheet as they are all thrown out. The house is basically my house, it is under my name and I paid the housing loan.

Well this time, Alonzo asked us if we were gonna leave. Me and one brother were going to get snacks, while the other stayed behind. Alonzo looked like he was uncomfortable. Me and another brother ‚ÄòAnthony‚Äô (17M), went to the lobby to get some snacks. When we returned, Alonzo was sitting outside looking distressed. We went inside the hotel room, and our brother ‚ÄòArmando‚Äô (22M), told us that Alonzo hasn‚Äôt done it in 2 days since the public bathroom was under maintenance.

As soon as Alonzo came back into the hotel room, I told him that he needs to turn on the sink and the shower, so he can be comfortable. Alonzo looked embarrassed and he was denied that he needed to shit. A fed up Armando and Anthony jumped in to tell him ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all family, there‚Äôs no need to be embarrassed, we all do it, and you need to grow up.‚Äù (Armando and Anthony knew he needed to do it before I said anything.) Alonzo starts getting mad at me saying that I embarrassed him now that Armando and Anthony know that he needs to do it.

I told Alonzo that he needs to grow up and he‚Äôs going to end up hurting himself over being embarrassed about something everyone in the room does. I suggested that we leave so Alonzo can be comfortable, but Armando and Anthony refused to leave, and they said he‚Äôs being silly. Alonzo stormed out of the room extremely angry.

141,1dnwhsn,AITA for refusing to go to events with one of my best friends?,"So I(19m), have one of my closest friends F(19f), we met when we were 13 in freshman year of highschool. 

Just last June/July, we were supposed to attend a semi-big anime convention together. We planned it since december 2022. I bought the entire weekend pass(was like $100) and everything. Though F cancelled on me in May, saying she could no longer go. Despite the fact that the tickets were nonrefundable and I'm not able to go in the city/big events near the city without someone. It's a rule my parents have placed especially since Chicago and the area has been getting worse as of a few years ago. 
After the con passed, F openly talked to me about how fun it was going and how she had went alone. Without me, despite cancelling nonrefundable plans. Never once apologizing.

This year, she plans to go alone again, not inviting me. Though F offhandedly said she'd ""take me to my first con next year"" because she wanted to take me to my first con. 

To which i replied, ""I don't want to go to my first con with you next year, that's two years too late to last year. I'd rather go with someone else more reliable instead."" Which is where I might be an asshole, as i might've been kind of mean stating it so bluntly.

She's now upset i'm holding last year against her, even though it hurt and i wasted a lot of money.

Telling her ""that last year was such a big event, and she ditched me to go alone. I wouldn't let her ruin big events for me two years consecutively."" 

F insists it's cruel to not want to go to bigger events with her, even though I love hanging out with her. Because it was a mistake, a year ago at that, and I'm being an ass for bringing it up 'at any given opportunity'.

AITA for refusing to go to any big events with one of my best friends?
",Not the A-hole,2024-06-25,"AITA for refusing to go to events with one of my best friends? So I(19m), have one of my closest friends F(19f), we met when we were 13 in freshman year of highschool. 

Just last June/July, we were supposed to attend a semi-big anime convention together. We planned it since december 2022. I bought the entire weekend pass(was like $100) and everything. Though F cancelled on me in May, saying she could no longer go. Despite the fact that the tickets were nonrefundable and I'm not able to go in the city/big events near the city without someone. It's a rule my parents have placed especially since Chicago and the area has been getting worse as of a few years ago. 
After the con passed, F openly talked to me about how fun it was going and how she had went alone. Without me, despite cancelling nonrefundable plans. Never once apologizing.

This year, she plans to go alone again, not inviting me. Though F offhandedly said she'd ""take me to my first con next year"" because she wanted to take me to my first con. 

To which i replied, ""I don't want to go to my first con with you next year, that's two years too late to last year. I'd rather go with someone else more reliable instead."" Which is where I might be an asshole, as i might've been kind of mean stating it so bluntly.

She's now upset i'm holding last year against her, even though it hurt and i wasted a lot of money. 

F is also upset I won't even humor thinking about going to Sabrina Carpenter's tour with her, instead planning on going with my sister and my mom(as I can't take a 13 y/o to chicago by myself).

142,1dnwbcj,AITA for Telling My Dad's ALS Foundation About His True Condition and Taking Back My Computer?,"I (29M) am my father's (65M) primary caregiver. He has ALS, and the ALS Foundation is providing transportation for him to go to a doctor that is 45 minutes away because nobody else is available to take him. They initially refused to take him without someone else joining him due to safety concerns of him falling. My dad lied and told them he could get around fine with his walker and there are no issues, but he actually needs help because his legs are weak. Later, I called them on my own to clarify the specifics of his condition, explaining that his legs are weak and that he would need assistance getting in and out of the van and that once he had his walker, he was relatively stable. They thanked me for clarifying these points so that they could relay them to the driver and confirmed with me that they would still pick him up. I told them to reach out to me if they need any more information.

When I told my dad about this, he got very angry, calling me names and saying I was stupid because now they wouldn't pick him up. They are still taking him, but he treated me terribly for clarifying his condition.

In response, I told him that he has lied and manipulated people his entire life and that his behavior has always disgusted me. I took back my computer that I had lent him, telling him that he could continue using it after we discussed his disrespectful attitude toward me. He replied, ""What are you, my father?"" and accused me of lacking sympathy for his condition. 

I understand that this doctor's appointment is important, and I have taken the trip with him 9 or 10 times in the past. But this time he will be on his own and I wanted to do everything in my power to prevent him from having an ugly fall during his trip to the doctor's office.

She is ""my"" dog in the sense that it was my birthday when we got her, and she was pretty expensive, so I agreed to do all dog-related care, training and clean-up. So far so good. She's awesome and I love taking care of her!  

Thing is, because we have children and he has a very time-consuming job, I selected a dog that is short-haired, low maintenance and cuddly. I also have a full-time regular job, and do all the childcare, cleaning, cooking, scheduling, and driving everyone around. So I did some temperament checks before selecting, and I'm happy to report that she's just as easygoing as I'd hoped.

My husband wants a second dog. He really wants a puppy of a certain breed that has higher energy and grooming needs, as well as a long, silky coat. A dog is a big deal and I don't want to do all the extra work to keep the house clean, especially with a new puppy. I've overextended as it is. So I told him if he would be the primary caregiver, cleaning up accidents and yard poops, doing training and making sure s/he was mentally stimulated and got plenty of exercise, I'd green light it.

He said I wasn't being fair. He hadn't complained when I wanted an expensive dog that he didn't love at first sight. (He definitely agrees that he loves her now!) So why shouldn't I let him get whatever kind of dog he wanted? I reiterated that he could get the puppy, he would just have to clean up after it, and keep it fit, healthy and trained well so it didn't get destructive. He keeps saying that's unrealistic with his job, which sounds like he expects me to do all the work. I said if he's not ok with the responsibility, then he shouldn't get the puppy. Our dog was expensive, but I was true to my word. He hasn't had to pick up a single poop or shampoo her or give her medications or even feed her. Now we are both grumpy, because he really wants that adorable puppy but I'm fed up with doing everything around here that isn't his paid work.

He even mentioned my brother‚Äôs girlfriend who had been texting all of us the first couple days of the whole thing but stopped on Friday. I told him that a phone works two ways (in a kinda jokey tone to keep the mood light) and that now that he knows my brother has his own phone, he can give him a call. I even mentioned that to my brother earlier today (to call my dad). He seemed somewhat offended to me saying that and proceeded to say how he was upset my brothers behavior for not calling him. I told him that my brother was at the lowest point of his life right now and needed all the support he could get, so he‚Äôd probably love to hear his dad‚Äôs voice. On top of that, my brother doesn‚Äôt have a great memory to begin with and gets distracted easily. He‚Äôs also been either tired or irritated so his energy is low. I told all of this to my dad, in an attempt to just get him to call my brother after our phone call.  I guess that pushed him to the edge cause he snapped. He told me to back off him and then curtly said he‚Äôd text my brother and hung up the phone. 
Well, I feel like a dick and cried about it afterwards. I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt his feelings, I wanted to keep him from overthinking calling his son, who NEEDS him. Idk what to do and feel like TA. ",0.0,1.0126513242721558,1,0
151,1dnv7pi,AITA for changing the art piece I commissioned from my sister?,"AITA for changing my sister's art?
So I am in a newly formed group for a DND campaign and I created an adorable character that I can't draw well. 
I have never been a "" fill the plank page with a image from your mind"" type person. They never do well. I can do shading with a variety of colours but that's all.
My sister's have been drawing for years so I asked one to draw up my character with some references from ai generated images. 
I asked her what her capabilities were and she said mostly everything so to just pick a style and she would do it. 
The style I had in mind would  take some time due to what looked to be emence amount of shaping and LOADS of shading. 
Hense why I commission her.
I've never been a great crique when it comes to art, for me it fits in 1 of 4 categories. Great. Good. Mid. Bad.
But I am only me, so who am I to judge.
She drew it up and sent me sketch of the progress throughout a single day. 
I thought it would take a lot more time
I was super excited to have it when she said it was finished. 
She signed it. 
I paid for it.
But upon a closer and less brain fog due to my excitement noticed that there wasn't alot of blending of the colours for smooth transition. Harsh lines and the shoes where.. very odd.

So over the course of the past few days I've been working on it.

It isn't finish. I know for a fact that my skill level as well as a free app on my phone will not be able to achieve what I would like for it. 

But I just wanted to know if I shouldn't tell her/show her (ever) that I have made many and bit changes to her work.

The other day I mentioned to my bf that I had a client meeting near his work the next day, so we agreed that I would meet him at his work place for lunch afterward. When I arrived, I didn't know anyone as it was my first time being there (he's worked there for just under a year). He wasn't in his office so one of his colleagues went to find him. When he came out, he was very surprised that I was actually there and was very awkward about it and said ""ya, I guess I have until 1:30"" like I had randomly shown up. We went to lunch, which was awkward and then back to his workplace. 

When we returned, he introduced me to 2 of his employees, one male and one female. The female employee and I got along and we were joking/poking fun at him. She then mentioned how they had a ""scoreboard"" of times each of them was right about something work related and that she was ahead of him and was almost time to collect on her prize, as the timeline is his 1 year anniversary. 

At first I thought this was funny and harmless, even cheering her on. I asked what her prize was and she said that he had to take her to lunch and he had to eat brussel sprouts (which he hates). I laughed it off and said I was impressed as I've never been able to get him to eat them. He quickly mentioned that another colleague (60f) was also involved in the bet and would be going with them. 

His employee then continued that he also had to buy them each a gift certificate for a massage. This is when I became uncomfortable but didn't make a scene and just looked at him and jokingly said ""wow, we're giving out massages too? I've never gotten that either!"" 

Not long after he had to take a phone call and I left. Later that evening, I brought up that I'm uncomfortable with this as it's weird and inappropriate to gift his employee a massage. He says it's not and they picked it. He said he's just purchasing the gift cards and giving it to them to book. 

I feel like it's weird that she would feel that comfortable to ask her male boss to purchase her a gift card for a massage (especially since she's engaged) and that he would gift this to another woman without a second thought.

There is almost nothing about Aruba he actually enjoys, at least from the perspective of what American tourists may do in Aruba. But he has made several friends there whom he considers to be his closest, and from that alone is inclined to return.

Said cousin ""introduced"" me to Aruba in 2022. I paid for him to come with me, after I had an ""annus horribilis."" Similar to him, I was also hooked on the place after my first trip. 

Since then, we've traveled annually to Aruba. He can't afford anything close to what I can, from accommodation to attractions, and as alluded above, he hates the beach as well as the ocean. In recent years, we've just coordinated timing, but mostly done our own thing while on the island itself, meeting up to chill out in the evenings.

This year, he expressed a strong desire to go for his upcoming 40th, but was unsure about being able to afford it. I can afford to take myself...but I'm not willing to give him a free trip to Aruba, since I know by doing so I will cause him to expect I pay for him in perpeuity. Because he desired to go, and I want to celebrate with him, I put in for a week off back in February. 

As time has progressed, the likelihood he can actually go continues to decrease; however he refuses to say with certainty if he can or can't afford to go.

I have given him another 30 days to make up his mind before I decide to do something else with that time off. Going to Aruba on my own is not outside the realm of options, however. But by doing that, I am concerned that I would insult him by going to his ""dream place"" by myself and not offering to pay for him alongside.

But by doing that, I am concerned that I would insult him by going to his ""dream place"" by myself and not offering to pay for him alongside.

So, WIBTA for going to Aruba, specifically without my cousin, in the year of his 40th birthday, when it's likely he can't afford to go himself (and I refuse to provide him assistance to do so)? ",0.0,0.009589250199496746,0,1
