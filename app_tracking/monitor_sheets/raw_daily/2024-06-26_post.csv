0,1doozgy,AITA for telling my son's birth mom that she's more like a sister?,"I adopted my son when he was born. It was an open adoption but the birth mom (Beth) was so greatly ashamed of being a teen mom that she didn't follow up on any contact. Which was fine because I had no intention of involving her too much. 

The truth is that Ethan grew up with two dads and three older brothers. We always try to have him spend time with girls. A couple of years ago when Ethan was 9, Beth reached out to see how he was doing. I think she spent the last nine year being an overachiever so she'd feel worthy of having a relationship with Ethan. Ivy league, married a hedge fund dude, yoga, etc.

Ethan is incredibly self aware and intellectual. You cannot bullshit him so he and I enjoy a very open relationship. I told him his mom reached out to me and asked about him. I emphasized that she didn't forget him but she had to go away to work on herself. I asked how'd he feel about talking with her and he said he was open to it. 

They have a good relationship and spend time together. He's met her husband. It's been a good thing to know his bio family. 

Ethan is starting 6th grade and he has to pick an elective class. There has been arguments about what that class will be. Anyways,he told Beth about it and she fucked up by getting involved with the matter. She said what's the big deal about his doing yearbook. He should do what he wants to do. It's his class.

I was like you got me fucked up. I said girl you are not his mom. You're more like a siblings and siblings don't get a say in parenting decisions. You take a backseat. You're a seat filler in the life of Ethan. Just don't forget your place. 

She didn't say anything and went radio silent. I was the bigger person and reached out. I said I've been raising that kid for 11 years so it was triggering for you to give your two parenting cents. You need to understand that. He understands that so you should too. 

I guess she's waiting for ME to apologize for something she did. I will not.

Heres the context; a friend of mine, we will call him Jon and his girlfriend, we will call her Jane, have a child one month older than my daughter who we will call O. O is about to be 6 months old in the coming days and has been a trooper about her milestones and over all strength, meaning she has a regular high chair at 5 months, been sitting up in the tub since she was 4 months 3 weeks old, and started rolling consistently at 4 months old.

Jon and Jane got angry with me saying im pushing my child to grow too quickly all because their kid, we will call them A, is delayed in their milestones and overall growth. A was born on time not early or anything but they were a bit on the smaller side. Not dangerously small but still little, meanwhile O was born at 9 lb 1 oz and she has been steadily gaining weight since. 

Now onto where i might be the asshole. When Jon and Jane started lecturing me on how i am a bad parent because i let my child grow too quickly i snapped. I yelled at them and said the only reason A is so behind is because they leave A in a pack and play all day long with a tablet 6 inches from her face. Currently A is 7 months old in 2 days. A is incredibly behind in growth, isnt hitting any growth markers, and has almost zero neck strength. I told them that if anyone was a bad parent that it was them not me, i work with my child on her strength and development every single day. We spend hours on the floor practicing rolling in every direction even though she is able to roll (she favors right to left so im trying to get her use to left to right rolling) she watches 1 hour of cartoons on mondays when I need to make phone calls to doctors and insurance but other than that one hour, O is either working with me on her overall strength, being read to, or independently playing.

2,1domhf3,AITA for asking my brothers to not pee with the door open?,"I (18M) have 5 brothers that range between 24-14. Most live in the house, and the ones that don’t, still often spend a lot of time here. As I said, I have 5 brothers, so any crazed activity that you can think of happens in my household. 

My brothers often pee with the door open, and it makes me uncomfortable. The bathroom is also built to where you can see what’s happening if the door is open, so it’s sort of disgusting. I mean, I get we’re all brothers but have some decorum. I’ve brought it up before, and they dismissed me saying that I was immature. They’ve continued doing it, and I’ve sort of ignored it. 

Well yesterday, my girlfriend was over and we were resting in my room, until we decided to leave to get dinner. We were walking down the hall, and we heard whizzing in the toilet and the door was wide open. I told my girlfriend to stay put, and I went to the bathroom and quickly shut it, not paying much attention to who was in the bathroom. My girlfriend and I then left the house and went to dinner. 

When I came back home, all 5 of my brothers were in the kitchen as I walked in, and they started coming at me. They were saying how I was immature, and I need to grow up. I then got slightly defensive, and I started getting a little loud telling them how it’s disgusting, they have no decorum, and I don’t want to watch them pee.

3,1domfhs,AITA going by my sister’s rules,"This is is such a trivial matter but we managed to have a fight about it… drum roll please… shopping. Classic sister fight.

We were out shopping and she found a dress that was cute and I said “yeah thats cute I want it” and she immediately snapped at me saying “I saw it first” and then took it, walking away from me. We usually go off of this rule so I let her have it and didn’t have a problem with this.

In the next store later she saw a clock that was a really nice decor piece and she said it was cute but then didn’t pick it up so I figured she didn’t want it and grabbed it. She said the same thing once again, “I saw it first” and I replied with, “You didn’t want it though.” And she agreed and walked away. I knew that if she truly wanted it she would snap at me like she did earlier.

Then later, in a store 30 mins later I found two earrings first, and told her that I liked them. She said she wanted them but I told her that I saw it first and that I wanted the first pick but then she can have the other pair. I still wanted to her to have one of them. We happened to like the same pair and I said it’d be my pick since I saw them first. And then she started full on fighting me saying that I was being unfair?

She brought up the fact that I “took” the decor piece from her earlier when she didn’t even tell me that she wanted it? If you see it first and want it then its yours. 

She only expressed that she wanted the clock to after she saw something I found first. 

Even then, I was letting her have the other pair of earrings that I found first to be nice.

Anyway, the fight was very small and over that she withdrew her invitation of my and my friends at her birthday party that I was planning for her….

Which made me laugh because it seriously isn’t a big enough deal to pull all of that. I told her I don’t care and I wouldn’t want to celebrate her anyway after this. She then called me a narcissist that doesn’t care about anyone. I kept explaining to her that she agreed with me about not wanting the decor piece and that she could have it if she wants, but then she full on p*shed me in the store. Which is when I told her we should have kept her on the bpd meds 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ & now shes crying like a baby to everyone. She even texted her gc of friends and I told her that I hope she feels pathetic for having to lie to them for sympathy. She was sobbing while I was just chilling and she keeps calling me a narcissist for that. I honestly think Im so used to her tantrums that Im unphased by what she or her friends think of me.

She says she doesn’t have money to drive over, spend the night in a hotel, and then drive back. This is not completely true as she drives past the city I live in often to go to the beach that is an hour and a half from my house. She has gone to the beach at least 5 times since my son was born. 

She called me the other day to explain that she felt I was keeping her grandson from her and it wasn’t fair that my mother in law has seen him about four times. She was upset and called me selfish and should think about how she feels. Note that MIL lives a 19 hour drive away. I explained that MIL got a hotel with a friend and she hasn’t spent the night either. I’m not stopping her from visiting. Just stopping her from spending the night. 

Am I really the one in the wrong in this situation?",0.0,0.017675322,0,1

I happily eat her under cooked sides and tell her they are delicious but I refuse to eat anything she prepares that could cause a food born illness. 

Examples of her cooking: raw meat loaf, raw and soupy green bean casserole, wet cornbread, under cooked potato soup, under cooked rice, etc. 

BUT...

She asked to do the steaks this time because she had, and I quote, ""already mastered the sides"".

I cant critic her cooking because she becomes extremely defensive, so I've never tried after I told her she made raw meatloaf, I've just decided to try and ""I'll help you with that"" with all parts of meals that could cause food poisoning. I'll happily shovel her gruel down my gullet with some things but not with chicken!

  
I've tried to suggest cooking channels or recipes but she just wings it, but she doesnt know wtf shes doing!

Even if the food wasnt always under cooked, it wouldn't have a good flavor (if any). Its been 11 years of this.

12,1dpdcc1,WIBTA for holding up my end of the deal?,"Throw away account...

So, my husband is pretty terrible with money, sent us bankrupt 20yrs ago.

We have two credit cards I have been requesting he get rid of for the past few years, but he refuses to. I have a feeling he is using these cards for mundane things and running them up and up. Right now, we are paying over $500 a month in credit card repayments.

He wanted a limited-edition pair of shoes. So, I offered to purchase them, IF he would give me the log in details for said credit cards so I can work out what we are paying interest on and try and get it paid out. We are a low income family, I am not able to work right now as our son is having cancer treatment. I told him if I buy these shoes, and he does not hold up his end of the deal, I will send them back for a refund.

So, the shoes are sitting waiting to be collected, and he has flat out refused to give me access to the online accounts so I can sort them out. I asked what he has to hide, I am trying to sort our shit, so we don't lose everything again.... apparently, he has nothing to hide.

So, would I be TA if I held up my end of the deal and sent the shoes back for a refund? I am teetering on feeling childish and feeling incredibly PO.

So a little backstory very little because this is just an example of what our life is with my sister. My sister (27) is very demanding entitled and acts like the world owes her, she had 4 kids and lost all but the youngest due to her lifestyle(though she wont admit it, according to her the state didn't take her kids her family stole them, i digress story for another time). EVERYTIME things don't go her way she screams, cries, throws a tantrum like you would only see in toddlers and threatens. Let me be clear, this happens at least twice a week and had gone up to five. She has our mom so wrapped around her finger that mom has gone into debt for her. But now I'm involved and it is close to putting my husband and our family in debt to ""keep her alive"" to use my mom's words. My sister refuses help btw and says she doesn't have a problem.

We let her move in with us at my mother's request (please just let her stay with you for a while, please i dont want her to hurt), now she has no responsibility whatsoever, she doesn't clean, doesn't cook, and she doesn't even take care of her own kid but she doesn't pay any bills whatsoever, she works when she feels like it and will only buy beer and cigarettes if she doesn't want to work she expects my husband and I to buy her these things or she calls mom and threatens if we don't.

A few weeks ago my (31F) sister wanted to go out to eat after I had made dinner she wanted us to take her out and buy her Taco Bell. I said no that there was food cooked and she could eat that if she were hungry. She got mad and started hurling insults at me, I'm a bitch, a cunt, my husband's gonna leave me for being fat, my kids hate me cause I'm so controlling and so much more. I told her I'm not controlling what she eats, that she's more than welcome to drive her own car, use her own gas and own money to buy the food but we were not. Anyway this goes on for about 30 mind with me just repeating the same thing over and over while she throws her fit, she calls our mom and AGAIN threatens mom if WE didn't do this for her. She brought me the phone and while mom is going off on ME, well while she stands there smirking at me I look her dead in the eye and tell them both ""I'm sick and tired of the emotional blackmail and I don't want any part of it anymore so either shut up or get on with it cause I'm done.""

Well apparently I'm the AH and I should have just done what she wanted TO KEEP THE PEACE... I'm tired of hearing that phrase so much by now. Mom said I took it too far maybe I did but hearing this from her for the last 15 years every single week multiple times a week ... I'm just tired. I have my own family to take care of now.

My parents split up when I was about 12 or 13, and I lived with my mom and saw my dad every other weekend.  When I was 15 my dad moved to another province for work and I saw him a couple times a year.  When I was about 23 my dad moved back to this province but was still about 4 hours away.  Around the same time, my mom (and now stepdad) moved and they live also about 4 hrs and a ferry ride away.

I spoke to my dad at least 5 days a week from age 23 to right before he passed, usually during my commute to/from work or while I walked the dog. This built our relationship and he would visit and stay with me multiple times a year.  My mom/stepdad have visited me a total of 4 times since they moved.  Naturally, this meant that as an adult I felt closer to my dad than my mom.

He was struggling with some major addiction issues at the time and has continued to deal with that over the years. He was never really involved in my life, and we only saw each other or even spoke occasionally during random holidays and special events. He never paid child support and was completely absent during my teenage years. 

About a year ago, when I was already engaged, my father reached out saying he wanted to rebuild our relationship. The last time I had heard from him was when I graduated college... 5 years ago. He apologized for not being there and said he regrets his choices. I was skeptical but decided to give him a chance. We met up a few times, and while it was nice to talk, things just didn't feel right. Honestly, it felt like something had been lost that could never be recovered. 

When it came time to send out wedding invitations, I made the decision not to invite him. I didn't feel like he had earned the right to be there on one of the most important days of my life. There will also be alcohol at the wedding and he is known to be a very angry alcoholic. My mother, who practically raised me on her own, has been supportive. However, when my father found out, he was devastated. He said he's really trying to make amends and that this would be a huge step in our reconciliation.

This summer they have gone to an out of state amusement park without me, I haven’t been invited to the same friends birthday and yesterday while we were hanging out I heard them whispering about a camping trip on certain days. 

I’m not getting invited to trips anymore and it really bothers me. It’s all I can think about and it ruins my mood. When I noticed communication was lacking a bit I asked a couple of them if I had done something wrong in hopes of finding out why I’m being ousted and they say nothing. I want to know what I did to get ousted like this, if it’s something I can change I’ll work on it but I’m getting nothing from them. The only thing I can think of is 
One of the days we were camping ended up being my birthday, I don’t normally party on my birthday but the trip was welcomed. I asked the group if I could bring another friend for my birthday and they said yes, she ended up acting like a fool and was horribly annoying to everyone in large group settings. I apologized to everyone after and took ownership for bringing her and have not brought her around since. 

So AITAH for texting one of the friends asking when their trip was so I don’t plan a birthday gathering the same days? I only did this to get a reaction from them and to let them know I know.

18,1dpbie6,WIBTA If I Don’t Respond to my Dad? ,"So For context, my dad uses this nickname ever since I was a baby and it bothers me so much. He uses it to get my attention when I’m being slow or he uses it when he comes home or when we’re ready to leave for school and says “Hi or are you ready to go? [Insert weird nickname] 

Anyways I told my dad and mom numerous times that I do not like it when he calls me that, but he still continues to do so. My mom also supports this too but she doesn’t call me this nickname. One day I asked him why he continues to call me that after I asked him not to for the 100th time, he said “To make me you mad/annoy you.” Idk if he said that as a joke but that pissed me off so much, wether it’s a joke or not I don’t like being called that and you shouldnt want to annoy your kids on purpose.

Anyways I told my dad and mom numerous times that I do not like it when he calls me that, but he still continues to do so. My mom also supports this too but she doesn’t call me this nickname. One day I asked him why he continues to call me that after I asked him not to for the 100th time, he said “To make me you mad/annoy you.” Idk if he said that as a joke but that pissed me off so much, wether it’s a joke or not I don’t like being called that and you shouldnt want to annoy your kids on purpose.

Husband & friends believe I am not but my family is being very “just get over it”. Sorry for any grammar,  shortened for character limit.

A bit of background: I'm 30F, I grew up in a way that I was always the one people would call on whenever work needed to be done. Moving, need to clear your house out, call me, need yard cleared and home repaired after a hurricane, call me, you get the point. I'm now living overseas so it's expensive to come back, but ive  still been making a point to come back at least once a year to do all the work i can.

That brings us to my grandmother's 90th birthday. When planning started a year before I spoke with my grandmother about coming to stay for about 3 weeks, to help get anything done after the party and spend the weeks after with her. It was confirmed many times before arrival.

On the party day I spent the rest of the afternoon helping my aunt & uncle setting up, loading and unloading, really whatever needed done. Mostly solving problems as they popped up.
The whole night I barely spoke with anyone as I kept getting called over to do something else. 

During one such problem, I ran out to get more trash bags, literally no more than 10 minutes, and I came back to them doing the family photo without me. Saying “we yelled for you”, why the hell didn't anyone at least call me. I was included in ONE group picture after I walking in, but of course that isn't the one being shared or used. I was so forgotten I was left out of my own family photo. I was nothing to them. 

The week after the party I spent that time doing hard labor, anything from redoing the outdoor shower to clearing 100s of pounds of dense brush and limbs in the Alabama heat with no AC. The last few days, she came up in the afternoon, and i thought oh well still a get days will still be nice. Nope she left the next morning, instructing us that the two guys would be coming up the next day and we had to switch houses. I didnt see her again by her choice.

I brokedown, and wrote her a letter trying to objectively lay out how I felt. Tried to attach photo here but cant, basically laid out everything from above, everything that can't fit here, everything over the years, and how all of that made me feel.

It just finally all came into view of how little i meant to them. All i got back was a text, “Olivia you are always welcome at my house. I have never not loved you and that has not changed, i always will. - Grandmother” It just feels so dismissive of what I experienced and felt,  not even a half assed “I'm sorry you feel that way”.

He said he'd rather stay at our place until the end of the lease. This isn't my ideal situation but it is ""our"" place so I don't have much of a say and he'll be here while I move out.

I will be moving out 14 days before the end of the lease and my family will be coming to help me that weekend.

My partner (M30) and I f(34) have been struggling, we have lived together for 1.5 years together for 2. We share a house with my sister, completely separate living areas, but shared yard. It's not an ideal situation, but it's cheap so we could save money and eventually get a place of our own. He has not been feeling secure in our relationship for a long time. I have friends that l've had for life, and do things on my own with them, as well as couple things. He does not agree with that and thinks that because I chose to do things with them alone I am not prioritizing him, as he should be included in everything. I struggle with this. Where I did make an error was I promised him that travel would be off the table unless it was with him. My bff recently asked to go on a road trip with her and her daughter. I said yes. I agree it's breaking that trust that I promised I wouldn't do, 100% on me. My partner who is currently away found out and is livid. The only time we discussed him coming back was mid July. He's away for work and to give us some space to regroup. The trip that I discussed with bff would have me returning way before he would, except he just changed it and now wants to come back the same weekend.

28,1dpavrs,AITA for telling my sister that she's rude?,"So I'll give you a rundown of my family. I (18m) live with my parents (56m and 65f) and my twin brother and little sister (16f) we have 4 pets, 2 cats and 2 dogs, 1 dog is the family's, the other is technically mine. one of the cats is my mothers and the other is technically my sisters. Now that you know that let me tell you how it went down. It was last night and my family was having dinner together and my parents were talking about something personal I won't mention here as to not doxx myself, but the topic came up about our pets, and it basically ended when I said I was grateful that my mom was able to get my dog only a few weeks before my birthday, which set my sister off I think, and she said that she was also happy that she got her cat a whole 3 months(ish) before her birthday. Initially I thought this was just an offhanded statement regarding a kind of coincidence of getting our technically own pets before it was our birthday, but I was wrong. after a few minutes and more personal info being talked about, I casually joked about my sister being a little entitled, and that set her off. She started yelling about how I got my dog only a few weeks before my birthday, and a lot of saying about how she barely gets anything for herself, and before I could get a word in my parents told her to go to her room, which she did in a huff.

Now for some context, I am a high functioning autist (aspergers) and have adhd and I tend to not have much forethought and just blurt out whatever comes to mind and  beat myself up about it when I say something that makes other people upset, but this time I generally feel that I was right in poking a little fun at her. This is because my sister doesn't really like me, my dad, or my mother, except when she gets something, then she's a bundle of compliments. For the majority of the past 2 years my sister has spent most of her time in her room talking with her friends, which I don't mind except in the rare times she's left its like the only person that she has a nice word to say is my brother, who is the family comedian. And ever since I was 10 or so, I'd deduced that she's the favorite of my parents, even though they say they have no favorite, they're either lying or its unconcious, but my sister tends to get whatever she wants within reason, like sleepovers, little anime figures, pillows, stuffed animals, you name it (and she doesn't take care of it, cause when you look it her room its like a bomb went off).

29,1dpajhb,AITA for asking my boyfriend to be sober for once while we make a memory? ,"TLDR: My boyfriend thinks it’s impossible to have fun sober and won’t even try. we’ve been together for 2 years and has yet to make one memory with me without the interference of drugs/alcohol. 



I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for almost 2 years, we met freshman year of college and are now entering our senior year. 

My boyfriend has had a history with substance abuse (he got a DUI last year and is now on deferred prosecution so he’s on probation for 5 years). He is legally not allowed to ingest any substance of any kind, if he gets caught he will go to jail and potentially never allowed to become a citizen. He’s been completely sober for about 6 months.

For the entire duration of our relationship (until he got sober) he was either drunk or high, or both. We don’t have a single memory together that doesn’t involve drugs or alcohol. I’m a social drinker, but with him being sober and us never “going out” or doing anything, it’s a rare occurrence for me to drink. I never smoke or do any sort of drug. Nothing against it, it’s just not for me. 

There’s a rave he wants to go to in August, he’s never been to one and is really interested in going. Neither of us are fans of EDM but i’ve never been to a rave either. I think it could be fun to experience something new so he suggested we go together. 

We started planning the trip, outfits, and started saving money to be able to go. Then he brings up how he’s going to be on shrooms and acid the entire time we’re there. I asked why and said i wanted to experience something new and fun with him, without the interference of drugs and alcohol for once. he got offended and told me there’s no point in going to a rave sober and that if he can’t do drugs he just won’t go. 

I tried explaining that it’s entirely possible to have fun sober and going to a rave shouldn’t be an excuse to do drugs. Acid and shrooms are cheap, spending hundreds of dollars to go to a rave with the sole purpose of doing drugs seems like a waste to me. 

He flipped out and told me he doesn’t want to go anymore, he doesn’t want to go with me, and i ruined everything.

All i did was ask him to make a memory with me and be fully present for it, for the past 2 years i can’t think of a single “fun” thing we’ve done that he was sober for and it makes me really sad. My boyfriend genuinely thinks it’s impossible to have fun without being under the influence of something, and won’t even try to do something that could possibly be fun if he has to be sober for it. 

Am i the asshole?


EDIT: I wanted to add to this by saying after a long conversation i ended up just telling him he could go and do all the drugs he wanted. I’m not mad at him for wanting to experience a rave on drugs. im frustrated he’s throwing away his sobriety and violating his probation over a tab of acid. i’m not responsible for someone’s sobriety. i’m genuinely upset he won’t experience anything “fun” with me involved and try to be sober for it. 

EDIT: clarifying that i’m aware going to a rave sober is a crazy ask, and especially dumb for someone to do while on probation and struggles with substance abuse and addiction. he’s adamant about going, i can’t convince him not to go. so it’s either he goes, and does drugs, or we don’t go at all and he resents me for “missing out on the rave experience”. i also can’t just dump him and be done, we live together. our lease ends in may when we graduate and moving out/living alone or with someone else isn’t an option.  



FINAL EDIT: i want to be very clear when i say this, I DID NOT SUGGEST WE GO TO A RAVE. ORIGINALLY I TOLD HIM WE SHOULD NOT GO AND IT’S A BAD IDEA.

This week, he’s had a stressful work week. Worked later than normal Monday (til 6:30 or so) and Tuesday (10pm).

31,1dpabdx,WIBTA if I tell my sister about my concerns for her future,"Well, this is my first post. I am really worried about my sister (31F) and her decision to get married to her fiancé (42M).  They've been together for a few years now and he proposed maybe a year ago and their wedding is approaching in 6 months. He makes her happy and I do appreciate that, my sister deserves nothing but happiness. However, he hasn't had a job since the first year they started dating. He hasn't made enough money to even file for taxes these past few years. He's had some gigs here and there to bring in some cash but it's nothing stable or consistent. I'm worried she's getting into a sticky situation marrying him. She's the bread winner, she has ambition, and she has goals. It just seems like he has none of that. From my observation she also does all the housework while he stays at home doing nothing. I don't know how to talk to her about it because my end goal isn't for them to separate but for him to get his life together. What if she needs to take a maternity leave in the future? Is she going to be the only one supporting their family? What if something (God forbid) happens to where she can't work, and her income becomes limited? 

I just want the peace of mind that she will be taken care of not only emotionally but financially as well.

Two years ago I was moved classes due to bully reasons since a guy from my old class said I should disappear and also other horrible things. This led me to a new class with people I never met before, I tried to be chill and make friends which was really hard since I have issues reading social cues and making conections with people.

In my first week, I was on P.E. and my team lost beacause a girl was braiding her hair and let the other team get the ball. On my school we are graded in who wins the most and I needed points, so after class I said she should stopping braiding her poorly dyed blond hair and help the team. I didn't know that she was in the mean girls group of this class. She had a friend (which we'll call K) who was a Regina George type of guy. He looked like the stereotypical mean gay even being straight, as far as I know.

This was around the time the Wednesday series dropped and the edits of her gothic dance with lady gaga on the back ground became popular.

The group decided that the series was perfect to make fun of me. They would call me Wednesday, do the dance laughing and play the song all the time when they saw me. One time they went far in the bullying by throwing a hairbrush at me saying I should ""brush the thing on my head"" since my hair was so curly and dyed bright red. K was the major bully in the group.

Around September we had a slam poetry event on my school, I used to write poetry about being bullied so I participated and read out loud one of my best works which was clearly about him. I had a public panic attack after that and the teachers had to remove me from the stage. My friends said that K was shaking while I read my work and I felt great for that.

In class, he said I was brave for telling people I didn't liked how they treated me and my poem was really beautiful. I accepted his words but didn't forgive. A week later he was being lowkey and not talking much. I so happend to know K's father because he was my teacher, him and I crossed paths during another school thing for nerdy kids and we started talking... I felt that K's apology wasn't enough so I talked to his father about the bullying he did with other kids and his poor grades.

In the end, K got punished and is forbidden to go out with friends or have a cellphone to this day. His friend group scattered because of that and he lost some friends too, K doesn't look me in the eye anymore and the school put me in a class different from his.

I was at the planetarium this weekend, and this guy was talking and being annoying. I told him to shut up, and he did, but after the show was over and he was walking out the door, he started talking again. I told him to shut up again, and he just ignored me. So, I followed him out to the lobby and was yelling at him to shut up. He smirked at me as he was leaving the building and kept talking. This enraged me, so I followed him outside, still yelling for him to shut up. At this point, a security guard came up to me and told me to stop. I explained that they were talking during the show, and he said he did not care and that I needed to leave. 

My wife said she was embarrassed and that me following them was weird, but I cannot stand being ignored and feel they deserved it.

So, I followed him out to the lobby and was yelling at him to shut up. He smirked at me as he was leaving the building and kept talking. This enraged me, so I followed him outside, still yelling for him to shut up. At this point, a security guard came up to me and told me to stop. I explained that they were talking during the show, and he said he did not care and that I needed to leave. 

My wife said she was embarrassed and that me following them was weird, but I cannot stand being ignored and feel they deserved it.

So, am I the asshole?

35,1dp9ih0,AITAH For Spending More Money On My Daughter Than My Son? ,"I(45M) have 2 children (16M ‘Dylan’, 15F ‘Sarah’), their mother and I divorced in 2017. My children and I hardly ever knew each other as a result of their mother not letting me see them. Dylan came to live with me in May of last year, and after certain events, Sarah came to live with me in Oct.

Long story short, my children grew up differently despite being raised in the same household. My ex displayed clear favouritism to Dylan. And would spend extra money on him because Sarah attended school online for mental health reasons (costed more money). So, when they came to live with me, he went to school in a whole other province for a few months. Which costed far more than her school. He was enrolled in a boarding school of his choice, because it's in the city he grew up in, and he wanted to be around his friends. 

He left by his own will, I told him he could go back any time. Sarah managed to make friends online and meet with them in-person. They're close now. So, she'll occasionally ask for money to go out, but according to Dylan, it's unfair because he doesn't do that. An ""unnecessary expense"" as he calls it. But alright. Sarah has very sensitive skin, on top of having a skin condition. So she has limited option for products she uses. Her products automatically cost more. Dylan complains, again, claiming that they're ""unnecessary expenses"". Sarah wears glasses, he does not. He sincerely believes that if we spend money on one of her needs, the same amount should be spent on him. 

Another example is when Sarah came here from her mother. She barely had any clothes. My sister sent a small sum of money in a gift card so we could buy her clothes. He went shopping with her and kept pestering her about buying him something from that store. Then, when she didn't, he went on for months about how she was receiving better treatment. 

But he has his benefits that we all simply have to ignore. He gets a monthly allowance to spend on games. He does not do any chores. His mother sends him a significantly larger amount of money than his sister, monthly. His room is filled with clothes and furniture that don't even fit. Etc. Etc. 

I told him that I wasn't spending any more money on him than I already do, today. When he asked if I'd help him with money to build a pc. Which, mind you, he already has one. He just wants a far better one. And he went on and on for hours about how Sarah got this, that, and the next thing. And that it adds up. Keep in mind, his room is stuffed with shit I bought him, that I did not buy Sarah. He got his mother and my partner on my case. They claim that it's only fair.

These tickets were a little over $2,000, something | was barely able to afford as a broke college student and had to work really hard to get, because I really wanted to go to the concert. I'm still working to pay off the dent these tickets put in my bank account.

Today, my mother told me that my cousin died. For context about my cousin, I think the last time I saw him was 15 years ago, when I was just a child. I haven't spoken to him since, as he cut off the entire family due to drug addiction. I don't even know how old he was. I don't even think he would've known what color my eyes are if someone had asked him, and I didn't even remember what he looked like until I saw pictures of him today. He's not my first cousin and was never a part of my life whatsoever, as ! hadn't seen him since I was a child.

Regardless, I was still sympathetic and I asked my mom when his funeral would be, because I'm very busy the next several weekends. She said she wasn't sure but l'd have to cancel my plans because family comes first and I told her I could cancel all of my other plans besides the concert.

Before you ask why I can't go to the funeral and then the concert (if the funeral is even on the same day, which is unlikely), my family lives in New York so we'd drive 5 hours to this funeral and then 5 hours back the same day. She told me I didn't have a choice, and I explained to her that these tickets were over $2,000 and I couldn't afford to just waste them, as they're nonrefundable. She said that family comes over a concert. I told her that if she was willing to reimburse me the $2,300 l spent on these tickets, I would go, and she just called me selfish and said she was disappointed in me. I couldn't bring myself to tell her that I shouldn't be forced to go because I never had a relationship with my cousin, because I knew that that would hurt her feelings, but I just kept telling her that I couldn't waste over $2,000.

Not entirely sure how I got into an argument with my mother about a hypothetical funeral date (which is honestly probably not even going to be on the same date as this concert), but my mom has since stopped talking to me. I feel like I'm old enough to decide if I want to go or not, and I also can't afford to waste $2,000 down the drain.

37,1dp8u1c,AITA for not reminding my husband he wanted kids?,"My (31F) husband (37M) got married at 26 and 32. I told him when we were dating that I never wanted kids and never wanted to get pregnant. He told me he did want kids. I panicked and said I would consider having kids if we used a surrogate and he had no problem with that. I regret agreeing but I didn’t want to lose him I can’t back out on that promise.
 
We talked about kids here and there but never any serious discussions. He never initiated. When we got engaged I broached the topic again to be sure he was aware. He genuinely said he has no problem with it. I asked him if he still wanted kids in the future. He shrugged and said ‘yeah I want kids.’
 
The day before we married I asked what his 5-10 year plans were (just to see if he said kids). He listed a few things but never mentioned kids. I believed he couldn’t be serious about wanting kids. To be 32 and not have kids in your 10 year plan despite supposedly wanting them? Now we have been married for 5 years and kept busy since then with travel, bought and renovated a house etc.
 
He never once asked me about kids or made ANY plans. I always thought that maybe he felt pressured bc he’s from Peru where they are very family oriented and he’s Catholic. Recently I think his mom kept asking him about when we are having kids and he finally told me he wanted to maybe start considering kids. I reminded him to our surrogacy talk which he remembered but said we should start looking into it.
 
So we did but it’s SUPER expensive. I said I don’t want to do anything THAT expensive. He agreed but said there’s no other option and will pay 100%. He wants a bio kid but hasn’t really been able to tell me why. I told him it’s nice that he’d pay 100% but I would rather we use that money for ourselves. He reminded me I agreed to this. I said I know I’m not saying no, I just really don’t like spending $40k just to have a child.
 
He mentioned his age saying we should do this soon. I said I understand but it’s not my fault he waited until 37 to start thinking about kids he’s supposedly always wanted. He thought that was a little mean to say but if he really wanted them, why did he wait this long to start, and now we have to do it ASAP bc he waited so long? He said we haven’t talked about kids since before marriage. I said yes because you never brought it up and if you asked me at 33 to start I would have agreed. He asked me why I waited this long if that’s how I felt I told him he was the one who wanted kids so I didn’t think it was my responsibility to remind him that he wanted kids. He said I knew he wanted kids so I could have said something. I reminded him that I agreed before marriage so he already had my consent to start the process any time, it was just up to him.
 
I refuse to take responsibility for this. I think he has the right to be upset with himself but not with what I said. I didn’t owe it to him to make sure he had kids.

39,1dp8pnc,WIBTA if I charge my friend rent?,"My best friend (both in late 20s) of 15+ years lost her job in March, I told her she could move in with my boyfriend and I, free of charge, until she could get back on her feet. We agreed that all she would help with is groceries. My thought process was that my mortgage will continue to be the same and utilities will likely not increase significantly with one more person living here, so I did not want to charge or make a profit out of her misfortune.

Since March, she has taken 3 overseas vacations while collecting unemployment. I’m not even that upset about the trips since most of these were already booked. But I’m annoyed by the significant shopping in preparation for these vacations. Things like clothes, shoes, pedicures, manicures, hair appointments, etc. I’m feeling a little used because I only offered her a place to move in since it seemed like she would not have enough money to cover her rent while she looked for a new job. I was thinking she’d use this opportunity to save up money so that she wouldn’t be in this position again. 

She just started a job this week and has started looking for a place to move but feels like July might be too soon, and is looking into august or September. Now that she’s working and still not contributing or offering to contribute, I feel like I’m really being used as she’s pocketing all paychecks and continuing to shop. 

In addition to that, I clean up after all common areas (bathroom, mopping the floors, etc.) and now make dinner every night as she gets home late from her new job. I guess it feels like I have a guest staying at my house but in reality it’s a roomate at this point. 

I don’t know what to do. As I said, I feel icky charging rent because I’ve always paid the same in my mortgage and her being here does not increase that. But there is a small level of discomfort with having to live with your boyfriend plus a roomate and I feel like her lack of financial control did indirectly have an impact on my life.

She said she didn’t care because she was going to quit anyway, that the the job made her miserable and the lady who was her boss was an asshole. 

She does help with some of the bills from her savings (half of mortgage, half of water + half of security) and does chores and does keep the house clean to be completely fair to her. She also owns the house because she was able to put a large down payment down with her trust fund money from her grandfather and her dad ultimately bought her car which I am 100% grateful for. 

However, she still doesn’t work since that last job in months ago. She claims she’s been trying and that there are no jobs and she doesn’t know what to do. I’ve offered alternatives but she either shoots the idea down or says it’s impractical. She says I insulted her when I told her that it’s not going to work if she goes two years (cumulative time) without a job. She said that she’s trying and she doesn’t know what she’s supposed to do.

I like spending time w/ them but don’t opt to go everytime mainly bc they are strangers to each other & He has to keep secrets (he curses, wants to cut his hair or used to smoke pot) every time he goes it’s a fight or at the minimum polite ignoring (he always comes back agitated, bags under his eyes, complaining about the entire experience)

They lived blocks away from each other their whole lives, he never traveled or lived apart until recently, his mom guilt tripped him into turning down jobs/leaving for school as it would take him away from the family. 
They had to move & she said the only way she would, was if her kids came too, so they all moved across country as a unit last January. 

When we all lived in Greenville, I would invite and they declined bc they ""didn’t know me"". no problem until We moved back to my house in TN.

I have invited many times, his sister came 2x, his dad came once after a fight with mom(he was driving back to Vegas until we talked him out of it) he stayed with us for a few days. His mom has not come &has already told us she probably won’t.

Today bf said me visiting only 3-4 times a year to his 7-10 times wasn’t enough, he hates when they ask where I am bc they just want to get to know me and it seems like I don’t want to.
I never saw it like that so I told him I understood & would commit to spending at least one other birthday/auxiliary holiday. that’s still not enough.
He said that they want a similar relationship that they had with 1st gf where they hung out at the mall together & texted daily (they were 20 and said gf was also extremely abusive/alcoholic). 

He accused me of not caring about family as much as him (not true, just more focused on quality vs quantity of time spent). 
He compared my fam- ""if I had been physically closer to my dad growing up I would get it.""(they broke up early but dad is my best friend & we talk daily so yes I see my family less, but we are much closer and more honest/real)

46,1dp80i3,AITA for forcing my son to see his bio sister? ,"My son Archie (9) is my biological nephew. My brother passed away shortly after he was born, and his mother lost custody of him when he was 2. My husband and I formally adopted him when he was 4, the same year we got married. Archie has a half sister, Tracy (11), his mum’s daughter, but not my brother’s. Tracy used to live with an uncle, but for the past three years has lived in a group foster home. Every other weekend, we drive Archie to a family contact centre to see her. 

For the past year, Archie has started to dislike these visits. He is always making excuses not to go, like faking being sick, begging to go to a friend’s house for a play date instead, every week it’s something. It’s a fight to get him in the car. I understand why he doesn’t want to go. At his age, most kids wouldn’t be hanging out with their sister, they don’t have much in common. Tracy has some impulse control issues, and can also be quite bossy, demanding affection from Archie and she is very jealous. She also tells him things about his birth mother that he would rather not know (things she heard from her uncle). Archie also getting to an age where he wants more independence, and seeing Tracy is a whole day activity as the contact centre isn’t close to home. 

He’s been asking more and more to discontinue the visits and my husband thinks we should allow it. He is getting increasingly rude to Tracy when he does see her because it’s all forced, and Tracy is getting increasingly mean to him because she’s understandably feeling rejected. My husband feels there’s no merit in forcing contact because it’s just going to make them resent each other. My parents agree. 

I get it, I do. But I can’t help but feel that Archie might blame us one day for him losing contact with Tracy. He’s young, and it may not feel like it now but someday he may want to have a connection with his blood. It may never happen, he may get older and never speak to her again, or he may regret not having that bridge. I just feel that a couple of hours of discomfort every other Saturday might save him years of feeling lost later. But I could be very wrong. I’m not a tyrannical parent. Seeing him unhappy makes me feel like shit because it’s hard to see a reason for it at this moment in time. I’m pushing it because it feels like the right thing to do long term but the short term loss is really weighing on me and I’m wondering if my husband is right. I also know that even if I wanted to - which I don’t - I can’t force this forever. He can’t be a teenager with me making him do these visits, so it’s only a matter of time anyway.

47,1dp7ezp,AITA for not giving my dad money that my mom left to me and my siblings?,"My (43F) mom (72F) passed away suddenly last year. We had a strained relationship but we made peace before she passed.

My mom and dad (75M) had been divorced 10 years when she passed. They negotiated their divorce themselves and did not involve lawyers. My dad gave my mom more than half of their total assets because she had been a SAHM and he still had earning potential when they split.

When my mom was sick she explained to me multiple times that she had left everything to me because she trusted me to split it with my siblings. She wanted my brother (39M) and me to each get half, then she wanted the two of us to decide what to give my sister (45F), who was estranged from my mom.

A few days after my mom died I spoke to my dad and he said that he and my mom had had a “verbal agreement” that she would leave him about a quarter of her assets if she died before him. At the time I was receptive and said that if possible I would give it to him. We agreed not to talk about it with anyone else but I ended up asking friends and my brother for their input. 

I eventually decided that I would give my dad the money but I would split it up over ten years because I’m concerned that he would mismanage it and I also did not want to end up with zero as my brother got half and my sister and I each got a quarter so my dad’s requested amount was almost my entire inheritance.

My dad and I spoke over the winter and he brought up the money. I said something along the lines of “I don’t think it makes sense to give you the lump sum but I was thinking of splitting it up over 10 years.” He became angry and started yelling at me that every penny of the money belonged to him. The conversation ended badly. 

I shared some of my concerns about the situation with a cousin. It got back to my dad and he sent me a scorched earth email saying that he is done with me and that this whole thing had been masterminded by me so I could keep all the money for myself. I forwarded the email to two of my cousins and was like, he’s done with me but please let me know if something happens to him.

So now we are not on speaking terms. But what I keep thinking of is that some of his outrage might be due to health issues I.e. he’s not thinking clearly. He might have dementia or another issue. He has always been like this but not at this level. I also on principle do not believe in leaving my father high and dry in his old age. I’ve always had the intention of helping him however I can. He was not a perfect father but he did a lot for me. If he is truly in dire financial straits I do not want to abandon him, but it is really hard to decipher the truth about his financial situation. For now I am doing nothing. But I am not at peace. AITAH?

I told my partner (34) of eight years this from the start and he always agreed.

We recently got engaged and he insisted on telling his parents that we would marry, but without a party or them involved in any of it.

I knew if he told his parents, I'd have to tell mine which I dreaded, so I tried to discourage him, but he didn't budge. We told mine who took it surprisingly well, even congratulated us - I guess they knew me and I've been living far away for ages anyway.

But his parents took it badly. They were elated at first, but when they heard about not being invited they went silent. Then the complaints started. The evening was fairly short after that.

Since then, they have been trying to organise stag/hen dos, defacto wedding parties, etc. But I declined all of it with the agreement of my partner. I didn't want to do this at any point and those parties would exclude my own very large family which wouldn't be fair to them - I find them difficult, but I don't want to hurt them by singling them out. If I did include them, I would have to fly them in which would make it exactly what I didn't want - a big event.

Anyway, we've given a blanket no on everything so far. Now our date is two weeks away and all we told anyone was that it would be in July. I don't want to tell them anything else because his parents especially want to be involved and post about it on social media - again, way too big for us.

It's exhausting, but I do wonder - am I the asshole here? I'd rather not get married than have a wedding party. I just absolutely loathe big events centered around me due to my upbringing and preference, so I was looking forward to just having this for ourselves.

Poor girl has had a rough go around and confides in Mark for alot of things, and constantly is calling him asking for advice. The other day Tessa called Mark around 5pm and was sobbing. She said she was nearby and asked to stop in, he said yes. Mark's sister, who Tessa is close with as well, was at our house.

She came over sobbing because her boyfriend was cheating on her and she didn't know if she should leave or not. She also just found out she had to have another cancer surgery. (She found out she had ovarian cancer right before she ended things with Mark). Mark and his sister comforted her and gave her their best advice. 

Once Tessa was calmed down, I said ""Hey Tessa? I dont think its a good idea for you to come back. You chose to end things with Mark, you dont now get unlimited access to my boyfriend. Please leave."" 

Mark and his sister immediately got defensive of Tessa, but she ultimately did leave. After she left they got super mad at me and said what I did was inappropriate, and now I feel bad. AITA?

51,1dp7393,AITA For laughing at my little sister when she asked for help with something I have offered to teach her numerous times before,"I (38M) have a half-sister (27F). She and I have the same mom, but different dads. Neither of our dads have ever been very involved in our lives so I have kind of been the only male role model she's ever had. We never had much money growing up so I started taking odd jobs around 14-15 for extra spending money. Yard work, paperboy, shoveling, etc. We lived in a smaller town and I ended up meeting a few middle-aged guys who were kind of do-it-all handymen and they took me under their wing. They taught me a lot about tools, cars, carpentry, you name it. I was never good in school but these two were a wealth of information and I was ate it up.

I worked hard in my 20s and was able to purchase my sis a cheap used car when she turned 16. I tried to teach her everything I felt she should know about basic car stuff but she had no interest whatsoever. She just wanted to drive around with her friends. She would always say ""Why do I need to know how to do ABC when I can just pay someone to do it?"" No matter how many times I offered to show her how to change the oil or swap a tire, she never took me up on it.

She has since purchased a newer car of her own and I've helped her with a couple basic repairs to avoid having to bring it into a shop. Each time I offered to show her what, how, and why I'm doing something, but she refused to even attempt to learn. She is very much a ""girly-girl"" and has zero interest in that sort of thing.

Last Saturday, I got a call from her at about 10pm. She had just gotten off work and got a flat tire on her way home. She lives in the boonies and works 20 miles away and she was stranded about halfway home. It was also pouring rain. She was upset because she didn't know what to do and wanted me to come help. Problem was, I had spent that evening drinking with some buddies and no way I was driving.

I told her she would have to either call a tow truck, roadside assistance, or wait there until morning when I could drive to her. None of these options were acceptable to her and she got pissed at me. She asked if I could talk her through changing a tire over the phone and I laughed. This made her even more pissed.

I told her I've offered over a dozen times to show her that sort of thing and she refused every single time. I told her I would gladly show her the next day, but no way am I trying to drunkenly talk her through it while she's upset and on a dark country road in the rain. She hung up but she did text me a few minutes later to tell me that a friend is coming to pick her up, ""no thanks to me.""

The next morning my mom called me and told me that little sis called her and told her what happened the previous night. She told me that she's disappointed in me for not helping my sister and that I shouldn't have laughed at her when she was upset because it only made things worse.

52,1dp6s7l,AITA for telling my friend I want to uninvite her gf from ALL our group outings so that we can have friend time without SO’s?,"AITA for not wanting my friend’s gf to come hang out? 

Me and a few friends have a “book club” where we mostly eat food and slightly discuss the book we read. It’s mainly to hang out and see each other as we are all in our careers and life gets busy. Of the 4 of us (all women), 3 have husbands/partners and one was single for the longest time. She has recently started dating someone (another woman) and has invited her to our book club hangout to meet her. I was completely fine with it and enjoyed meeting her and very happy for my friend to be dating someone seriously, as this is her first serious relationship in several years. 

Now, I hang out with this friend significantly less since she started dating the new woman, which I understand priorities shift, however now when we do meet up for book club the past three times she brings her girlfriend. Her gf doesn’t read the books either, so it’s kind of moved away from book club and more just a scheduled hangout.  Now these typical “girls dates” seem very third wheel. This was always just an us thing and the husbands and bfs never came, but because she is gay and has a gf, her gf comes as “one of the girls”. 

We mentioned going away for a girls trip in our book club chat (which the gf is not a member of) and we thought it would be really fun. Now I’m finding out that the gf would come too. It feels hypocritical to have her gf invited but specified it be a “girls trip”, which leaves out our male partners but can include her gf. 

I’m really happy my friend has someone she loves and is serious with, but I feel like it’s annoying to be with several friends and one couple. We were going to hangout today, and I just found out her girlfriend was going to come with. Since I was going to talk to her in person about this trip, I asked that she not be included today so I could discuss this with my friend in private. She is now taking it very badly, so I explained on text that I’d still like to have girls time, sans couples, like we have for years. She is upset I don’t see her gf as “one of the girls”, when it’s not really about that, but more so, if we bring couples, why can’t I bring mine (male) too?

I (18M) Have lived with my parents my whole life, they are not separated and they are not fighting other than the occasional bickering that happens in most families. Through these 18 years of my life my parents have always semi-supported my dreams and have bought me almost everything I have asked for (which I am very grateful for) however even through all the support and nice things my parents have never made me feel loved or even wanted I some cases. My mother is homophobic and even though she acts nice most of the time she’s always judging negatively, making comments and thinks the world revolves around her most of the time since she is never at fault unless you corner her into an argument, then it’s suddenly “Well I’m human! Of course I make mistakes!” Where if I were the one who acted out the exact same way I’m suddenly the villain, a donkey, an ungrateful human and she’s the victim so many times when I’m at fault she will say things in an argument that are really hurtful and then claim she never said those and that I’m lying and painting her as a bad person. My father on the other hand can be very sweet sometimes, he usually spends a ton of money of shit he doesn’t need and then complains he has no money but he is the person that has told me the worst things yet, openly admitting he only had a kid because my mom wanted one, calling me selfish because I’m tired and I don’t want to walk at night all the way to the store to buy him ice cream or juice or whatever he wants, telling me that if I call the police nobody would believe me because “i am just a child, and who would believe a child?.” And saying I have a demon inside of me (my parents are crazy religious so it hurt coming from them), on top of that I am overweight and my mother used to always make comments and pushing me to lose weight any way I can, spending tons of money and then blaming me because I didn’t lose weight in the end. So Last week was my graduation, after we got our papers we had a small party and went home, at home I had scheduled to game with some friends but my parents wanted to go out with relatives and told me they had already informed them, we got into a fight because they didn’t inform me and had they done that I could have scheduled my time differently, after the fight my mother asked me “why are you acting this way?! What do you feel?!” And for some reason the only thing I could say was “Not loved”. So, Am I the asshole?

57,1dp6d5y,AITAH for not attending my mother's funeral?,"Hi,

I barely ever post stuff but I’m (27M) really struggling with something that happened recently and need an outside perspective.

My mom (56F) passed away unexpectedly last month. It’s been incredibly hard on me because we were very close. However, my stepfather (58M), who has been married to my mom for the past 15 years, has never really gotten along with me. We’ve had our share of conflicts over the years, mostly stemming from how he treated my mom and his attempts to control different aspects of our lives.

When my mom first got sick, I tried to visit her as often as I could. My stepdad and I had a few tense encounters during that time, but I thought we were managing to be civil for her sake. After she passed, I reached out to him to discuss the funeral arrangements. He was cold and dismissive, telling me that he didn’t want me there because it would “cause too much drama.”
It felt like he wanted to take revenge on me for something.

I was heartbroken and tried to reason with him, promising to stay in the background and not cause any issues. But he was adamant that I stay away. I even suggested we have a separate service for her friends and family who couldn’t make it to the official one, but he refused.

AITA and did I let my mom down for not attending her funeral because I decided to follow my stepfather's orders?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-26,"AITAH for not attending my mother's funeral? Hi,

I barely ever post stuff but I’m (27M) really struggling with something that happened recently and need an outside perspective.

My mom (56F) passed away unexpectedly last month. It’s been incredibly hard on me because we were very close. However, my stepfather (58M), who has been married to my mom for the past 15 years, has never really gotten along with me. We’ve had our share of conflicts over the years, mostly stemming from how he treated my mom and his attempts to control different aspects of our lives.

When my mom first got sick, I tried to visit her as often as I could. My stepdad and I had a few tense encounters during that time, but I thought we were managing to be civil for her sake. After she passed, I reached out to him to discuss the funeral arrangements. He was cold and dismissive, telling me that he didn’t want me there because it would “cause too much drama.”
It felt like he wanted to take revenge on me for something.

I was heartbroken and tried to reason with him, promising to stay in the background and not cause any issues. But he was adamant that I stay away. I even suggested we have a separate service for her friends and family who couldn’t make it to the official one, but he refused.

Feeling desperate, I reached out to other family members, and while they were sympathetic, no one wanted to get involved or challenge his decision. On the day of the funeral, I respected his wishes and didn’t attend. Instead, I held a small, private memorial with a few close friends to say my goodbyes.

Now, some family members are saying I should have stood my ground and gone anyway, that my mom would have wanted me there and she would be disappointed in me. Others think I did the right thing by avoiding a potential confrontation on such a solemn day.

58,1dp6a31,WIBTA if I moved out of the house my mother is renting immediately?,"My mother and I have always had a strained relationship due to her constantly criticizing my appearance. She would call me a ""cow"", ""fat"", ""ball of grease"" and say that at my current age, she was never the size I was. Because of this, I developed a serious eating disorder and for 8 years was stuck in a constant cycle of binging and purging. Recently, I started taking Semaglutide and it helped alleviate the ""food noise"" and I am now 3 weeks binge/purge free. 

Up until now, I have been living with my mom. I am currently going to school for my masters and although I pay around $900.00 in rent, it is significantly lower in comparison to getting my own apartment. Additionally, my mother recently divorced my stepfather and splitting the rent is giving her the opportunity to clear any debts and increase her savings. Every once in a while, we would have explosive fights where it would end in us going back and forth saying hurtful things to each other but I would let it go and just move on. 

Today, we had another fight, probably the worst one...because she was upset I used her tennis shoes due to my dog biting my pair. We started going back and forth and she said a lot of hurtful things such as ""I can't wait for you to die...from the looks of it you're close anyway"", ""You're nothing without me, I created you. I am the reason you even have education or had any success."", and a lot of other vulgar words...However, I just can't get past the bulimia thing, she has seen me cry, lose hair and bleed because of this disorder and she had no issue weaponizing it. I recently started dating a very supportive and sweet guy and he has always offered me to move in with him because he is aware of my current situation.

To make this short, after the fight my mom told me she no longer wanted me to live with her and because the lease is ending in October, she told me to pay everything in advance and move out. Now, I am not in a contract with this house and I had only just been offering to help my mom's lease because she is newly divorced. I told her I would not be paying rent for any months I am not living at this house and told her I would pay this month and move out and that she can figure it out on her own.

Now I don't want to speak for my mom but she is too nice to stand up for herself in these contexts. I have spoken to her and know how she feels, however, she just said that she is okay with that arrangement to make my brother happy.

It's been rough for everyone but especially for her. Our family rallied around her. Helping out as much as we can and I’ve been there every step of the way because I love her so much. But since the accident. it feels like I don't deserve to have any good things happen to me or at least I’m not allowed to talk about them. Every time something positive happens in my life I get shut down by my family. When I got a promotion at work last year I was so happy and excited to tell them. I thought my family would be happy for me but when I tried to share the news. My mom pulled me aside and told me to not now because my sister had a tough day. I ended up keeping it to myself.

8 months ago my boyfriend proposed. When I told them. My mom immediately changed the subject later telling me that my sister was feeling down about her own marriage struggles. It’s like anything good in my life is an offense to my sister’s situation.

This happened a few days ago. I’ve been saving up for years to buy my first new car. I finally managed to do it and I was so excited. I thought my family would be happy for me. So I decide to tell them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth the room went dead silent. My mom whispered to me ""This isn’t the time. think about your sister"" My sister looked so sad and I instantly felt like the worst person in the world.

I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I said ""Can't I share anything good in my life. I thought you’d all be happy for me"" no one knew what to say and I left the house. I’ve never done that before. Now I’m filled with regret and confusion. I love my sister and I never want to hurt her but it feels like I’m not allowed to have anything good happen to me. It’s getting to the point where I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time. I understand my sister’s life has changed drastically and I’m genuinely supportive and have always been there for her. But sometimes I just want to be able to share my own life too. I feel so guilty for even feeling this way like I’m being selfish or inconsiderate.

Her husband and even my parents share things about their lives freely and no one seems to mind. But as the younger sister I’m not allowed to share anything good in front of her so I don’t hurt her feelings. I get it. I really do. I understand she’s going through a lot and I don’t want to add to her pain. But it feels like I’m not allowed to have any joy in my life around my family.

Now I know I owe my sister an apology for how I reacted. I never want to make her feel sad but I’m struggling with how to approach my family. I don’t feel like I should apologize to them. And honestly I don’t think I’ll be sharing anything with them in the future.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-26,"AITAH for what I said? my family won’t let me share any good news because of my sister's disability I 26F have an older sister 32F who had a tragic accident three years ago that left her paralyzed from the waist down. It's been rough for everyone but especially for her. Our family rallied around her. Helping out as much as we can and I’ve been there every step of the way because I love her so much. But since the accident. it feels like I don't deserve to have any good things happen to me or at least I’m not allowed to talk about them. Every time something positive happens in my life I get shut down by my family. When I got a promotion at work last year I was so happy and excited to tell them. I thought my family would be happy for me but when I tried to share the news. My mom pulled me aside and told me to not now because my sister had a tough day. I ended up keeping it to myself.

8 months ago my boyfriend proposed. When I told them. My mom immediately changed the subject later telling me that my sister was feeling down about her own marriage struggles. It’s like anything good in my life is an offense to my sister’s situation.

This happened a few days ago. I’ve been saving up for years to buy my first new car. I finally managed to do it and I was so excited. I thought my family would be happy for me. So I decide to tell them. As soon as the words were out of my mouth the room went dead silent. My mom whispered to me ""This isn’t the time. think about your sister"" My sister looked so sad and I instantly felt like the worst person in the world.

I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I said ""Can't I share anything good in my life. I thought you’d all be happy for me"" no one knew what to say and I left the house. I’ve never done that before. Now I’m filled with regret and confusion. I love my sister and I never want to hurt her but it feels like I’m not allowed to have anything good happen to me.

69,1dp53on,AITA for telling a friend him constantly raging when dying in game is problematic?,"My friend (Let's call him Bob) and I are part of a trio that plays video games on a regular basis. Bob is a good friend and a fun fellow to play with, when he is calm.  Though recently, Bob has an increased anger issue when he dies in games like CS2. He'll start whining and shouting ""WOW!"" everytime he dies. He also blames the enemy team, accusing them of hacking, smurfing and even blames the game, threatening to rage quit or uninstall a game. He also lashes out if any of our teammate makes a mistake. Whenever he gets angry, the mood becomes awkward and the gaming session is soured. It has been rather demoralising  lately and I feel sad for him.

Personally, I get annoyed when he does this that it has started tilting me. I don't really get upset when I die but I can see how him being killed by the enemy team makes him frustrated to the point of raging. Also, seeing him not having a good time makes everyone not have fun.  The other friend and I try to stay positive and say ""nice try"" and ""we'll get him next time"" or tell him to calm down which of course will get a negative reaction from him. He'll say ""SURE"" in a condescending way whenever this happens. At that point my friend and I just not say anything lest he gets saltier and self-deprecrate.

The last time this happened, I told him his behaviour has been really annoying recently and that I'll not play competitive games with him anymore if he keeps raging. I suggested that we play coop games instead of competitive ones to which he stoned walled the group.

I value our friendship as he's chill irl that's why I'm choosing to be forward with him (else I would have just block him). So AITA or WIBTA for giving it straight to him that his raging problem is worsening and its souring everyone's gaming experience?

I feel like I could've been nicer and just lent her the dress, but still, I got very attached to it and would hate it if my sister had worn it before me, especially since I bought it with my own money. She has a job while I do not, so I don't have any reliable source of income.

 AITA?



Update: She quite quickly found something else to wear. She is also now acting like nothing happened, despite me still feeling very upset.


Update 2: We've moved past the incident and are all good now. Didn't talk about it tho. ",0.0,0.04376688599586487,0,1
76,1dp402r,AITA for telling my boyfriend to clean up after himself?,"my (21f) boyfriend (21m) have been together for 6 years. ill call him mike. i initially moved in with his him and his family when i was 17 due to personal family issues. after we started college, i moved out and have been living on my own since.

when we first moved in together, we were both very messy. i was going through some super rough times with mental health struggles and family issues so i didnt take care of myself very well. i didnt take care of my clothes and i had food containers that i just didnt take care of, as well as just random shit everywhere. i hated it and it stressed me out but i just couldnt get myself to clean because i was so depressed. my boyfriend's whole family was beyond what i was at though. like mold growing everywhere, dogs peeing in the house, dishes piled up in the sink no matter what. 

mike's room was the worst. literally a carpet of dirty clothing was on the floor. so many dirty dishes and trash everywhere. there was no ventilation so dust just stuck and made us sick. i would talk about how it bothered me and he would say ""well you made a lot of the mess too"". i did contribute a bit, with dirty dishes not being taken down but that was about it. 

it came to a point where i had to be like okay we are cleaning today! but it would be me cleaning his room out for 5 hours with a mask on and him coughing and complaining about the dust and only helping a little bit with the sorting of clothes.

i helped around the house as much as i could because his family took me in and i was so grateful. id clean the bathroom, take the garbage out, etc without them asking.

fast forward to now. my mental health is so much better, and i am finally able to fully take care of myself and be content in my own space. i deep clean every sunday at my apartment, and tidy after myself. im not perfect, but i keep the place clean and presentable.

mike has only changed a little bit. he has his own space now, and kept it presentable for like a month but it contstantly falls into disrepair and is just so dirty. i originally told him last year i wouldnt be coming over if his room is dirty. he cleaned it, but then i realized he was just shoving everything into the closet because he literally doesnt know or care about how to fold clothing or put anything away. he has never vacuumed his room, and his bathroom has never been cleaned. not even the toilet or the top of the sink. it looks like a frat bathroom in there and it makes me nauseous. oh, and he has only changed his sheets once in the past 9 months i recently discovered!!

anyways, i have been kinda on his ass about cleaning things. i told him that it really bothers me and makes me want to come over less. he said to me last night that ""its his space and i need to understand that he doesnt care about his messiness"". he also that that it makes him want to clean less when i ask him to because i do it condescendingly.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-26,"AITA for telling my boyfriend to clean up after himself? my (21f) boyfriend (21m) have been together for 6 years. ill call him mike. i initially moved in with his him and his family when i was 17 due to personal family issues. after we started college, i moved out and have been living on my own since.

77,1dp3zvz,AITA for taking a job away from my 8yr f step daughter,"So a little back story me 24m and my 31f gf have an agreement with her 8f daughter and 12f daughter that I can give them jobs since they are at the age where they want to make their own money to buy toys and stuff like that. So about 2 weeks ago my puppy really needed a bath so I asked the girls if they would like to make a little bit of money. Only one can give the puppy a bath since our bathtub and bathroom are so small. Well they both wanted to do it. So I made them play rock paper scissors to figure out who gets to do it.

Well my gf being a mom and protective of her kids gets upset and goes and finds the oldest. Well she comes down after some time and starts an argument with me about how I started a big fight between the girls. Says that I wasn’t fair and how I should make it up to her. Now this is where I can see I was a bit of an a$$. I went into the bathroom and took over giving the puppy a bath. Gave $5 to the youngest and $5 to the oldest.

They do not have kids, they’re not in their 70s, and she doesn’t have any conditions requiring her to be on the ground floor, but that description does fit a lot of people staying. So she is forcing all those people to accommodate HER and switch rooms. The next day my mom makes pasta sauce and my SIL announces in front of everyone that the sauce is too sweet and needs garlic. After adding garlic she shouted at my mother “it is STILL too sweet!” Someone told SIL to stop being rude to which she announced “I am not being rude, I’m stating my opinion.” Then she storms off to her room and slams the door in front of all 20-something of us. The food thing is a common problem with my SIL. She always comments on food.

79,1dp3kwy,AITA for not getting over a broken cup? ,"We live in the middle of nowhere and host a July 4th BBQ and firework show for my family. Last year my SIL Megan decided she didn't want her daughter (3) drinking from a plastic cup. Megan went into my kitchen and went through my cabinets and found my Chip (from beauty and the beast) that my mother got me at Disneyland. In giving a ceramic mug to her toddler it was dropped and broken. She did not tell me about it and saw it in the trash. I asked a cousin who was inside the kitchen and he saw Megan tell her daughter “not to tell anyone that she broke it”  I confronted Megan and the scene got very ugly mainly because I asked why do you think it's okay to go through people’s stuff and break them while being guest in the house. She tried to tell me her daughter got the cup and I said the cup was on a shelf in an upper cabinet and couldn't have reached it. 

Megan acted like I was in the wrong because plastic cups are bad and her daughter doesn’t drink from them. I told her toddlers shouldn’t be drinking from coffee cups and apologize when they break something.  This put a rift between Megan and I and she has yet to apologize so when it came around time for this year's 4th of July bbq,  Megan is off the guest list. My husband told my MIL who said I’m still going at it over a stupid cup and he should divorce me for being so petty. So now my MIL and some of my husband’s family isn’t coming and I say good. My husband wants me to drop cup issues but it’s not only about the cup. It’s because his sister felt entitled to go through my cabinets, take an item out, her daughter breaks my beloved cup, she covers it up and puts it in the trash, tells her daughter to lie about it, and when confused plays the victim and refuses to apologize for HER behavior and blames me.

82,1dp26vy,AITA for not giving my sister a part of the business?,"I (21f) have two sisters (31 and 33) with whom we share a business and a few properties. As the business started to decline, I suggested that we fix up an abandoned property and start a business there. Neither of them wanted to invest money or even show interest, so I decided to take charge of fixing up the place and covering the expenses myself. Now I am renovating an entire property to turn it into a joint business, even though I want to distance myself from my family, but I need the money, and this is the guaranteed way to get it. So I decided to do it as the last time I do something for them and save my share of the profits from this business to start one on my own.

Now the issue is that my 31-year-old sister wants a part of the property to open a small restaurant and keep all the profits for herself. She’s not going to do it now because she doesn't have the money but also doesn’t want the place rented out until she gets the money. I haven't told them yet, but it seems unfair to me that I'm making such a big expense and she wants to split the property (without putting in a single dollar for repairs) to start her own business. I feel like if I were the one wanting to start my own business there, they wouldn't let me.

It makes me very angry because she excuses herself by saying, ""I have two daughters and need more money."" She only takes care of her daughters, even though they have a present father with income, but he doesn’t even contribute to the diapers. She’s also not paying rent because she’s squatting in my apartment from which she kicked me out. She’s building a luxurious house and sends one of her daughters to a high-society private school.

It angers me because, in the business, she always took out much more money, but when I asked for money, she said there wasn’t any. The situation that marked me the most was when I told her I wanted to go study in another city (since the profession I want is not taught in my city), that I would get a job there and only needed money for rent, she said no because there wasn’t any money. But weeks later, she rented a place for herself, her daughters, and her boyfriend (who didn’t contribute anything) just because she couldn’t stand her mother-in-law anymore.

84,1dp1lut,AITA for telling my mum I want to get eloped?,"Hi everyone!! I (22f) got engaged recently to my bf (22m) of 5 years. To say that I am happy would be an understatement. As every girl in the world, I always dreamed about my wedding day. Personally, I was never a fan of big parties, so my dream wedding was actually going to the court house and get married with the best man and maid of honor there, sign the papers and have a private celebration at home. I always imagined celebrating that moment with my partner and closest friends. Aside from that, I also didn't want any family there, and this is where my fiance agreed with me. I have this gut feeling it would potentially ruin my moment, my mum with her comments or my fiancé's mother with hers, my aunt with wanting to be a part of the preparations like doing my make up or getting my dress for me. Since I am not a confrontational person, this would end up with me having to agree or just stay silent and take whatever they say. I don't want that, I don't need the unnecessary stress on that beautiful day.

Onto the where I wonder if I'm the AH. I was talking to my mum and she asked about wedding plans and I said it would probably be very private and just one day where we get dressed all pretty and went to sign the papers. My mum was pissed. She asked how could I exclude her and my family from such a big moment (maybe because I'm the first child to get married in my family), who would walk me down the isle, who would be the flower girl, where would hold everything, what about my dress etc.

I said that it wasn't about my family, it was my day, my and my fiancé's day and we both agreed that we would want a private little eloping moment with close friends who would probably just be our best man and maid of honor, but she wouldn't hear any of that. She went and vented to my aunt and now the story has gotten to almost every member of my family. They have all been texting me asking if I knew that I was ruining a beautiful moment and that I would regret it in the long run.

My fiance has taken my phone and told everyone that we are taking a small break and won't be answering the phone.

I said that it wasn't about my family, it was my day, my and my fiancé's day and we both agreed that we would want a private little eloping moment with close friends who would probably just be our best man and maid of honor, but she wouldn't hear any of that. She went and vented to my aunt and now the story has gotten to almost every member of my family. They have all been texting me asking if I knew that I was ruining a beautiful moment and that I would regret it in the long run.

My fiance has taken my phone and told everyone that we are taking a small break and won't be answering the phone. He took me to our little house in the countryside where he knew I would feel better until everything cools down. I'm currently working on our garden trying to get my mind off of things.

Story time: At first all of us (his friends) were ecstatic for him meeting someone new and having us meet her. We tried to include her into our friend group, but very fast we saw she made no effort to talk to us or be with us. She was either quiet, by herself or had his tongue down her throat. A few times we met they were alone in the corner making out and in those few times she barely said hello or not even that. Even he was annoyed with her since he wanted to hung out with us, not make out constantly and told her to stop multiple times. She then screamed like a child in his face ""playfully"" and kept on going. I even tried talking to her about things she likes and she wasn't interested to have a conversation with me. Or anyone else for that matter. We quickly had a bad feeling but didn't get a chance to know her. He moved in with her after a month of being together on the other side of the country. He rarely texted us and didn't visit for almost a year. I texted him to remind him that my boyfriend is celebrating his birthday and that he would be really happy if he surprises him. We made a deal that he comes and sleeps over. A few days pass and he asks me to send pictures of us together for a gift and I ask if he's coming and he says ""we're coming."" My face dropped, I knew my boyfriend isn't going to be very happy about her coming along so I told him and he got upset and said he doesn't want to spend his birthday being with someone who puts no effort to be friends with us. He said he doesn't want to be uncomfortable on his birthday. We spent an hour trying to text him if he can come alone. I stayed respectful and also stated that we can always meet up together and try again. 
Apparently she goes on his phone and reads his messages and she saw my message and flipped. He almost didn't show up because they argued so much. He came over and we had a talk with him and told him how we see her and that we're worried since he always had toxic girlfriends and always defended them. He said he will try talking to her but he made it seem as if she's the one deciding on our friendship. She blocked me everywhere and told him she won't hang out ever again.
Did I do anything wrong? Is she right to be upset?

Edit: just to clarify! I only invited him to surprise my boyfriend, because they are best friends and the closest in our friend group.

One thing led to another and my step dad brought in my little sister (10 f) (who is in custody of her dad due to a accident when she got a hold of weed and was sent to the hospital) this was what made me start crying I love my little sister a lot

My mom then asked me if I wanted to go back to my dad (we are currently in Arizona since it's my mom's time with me and my dad lives in Washington he has main custody of me) I of course said yes and texted my dad telling him I wanted to go home

My mom was upset by this of course and she started crying

A bit later into their argument my step dad was on his way to their bedroom and my mom was in the kitchen I was in the hallway she asked me if it was his fault that I wanted to go him and I told her it was both of them and that I just couldn't deal with this anymore because last summer I had to go to a hospital because of this (I had never told her about this because she tends to get very upset about this kinda stuff due to her bipoler)

She kept saying things about figuring out how to make sure I never had to see her again but I kept saying that I love her and want to see her but she wasn't listening to me

I went to my room since the argument started back up again and I got a call from my dad he was very concerned and I was in tears

We talked for about 17 minutes on speaker in front of my mom and some in front of John mainly him comforting me and talking about how it wad a difficult situation and he would figure out a way to get me back though I may be stuck her for a few more days

Once I calmed down they started arguing again and me and my dad continued talking for a little while longer because my step dad starting talking shit about him and my moms relationship (they are strictly friends because I was the one who told them to get divorced because they simply don't go together romanticly)

After me and my dad hung up I put on my socks and shoes and went for a walk to clear my mind while they argued

Once I got back they were still arguing and my dad called me again to just check up on me again since my step dad and mom are trying to drag him into their argument

My dad talked to me about his bowling league and that he did terrible (I also do bowling league it's  something me and him love and we do league's together) I laughed a bit 

he asked me if my step dad hangs out with my step sister I said only when we all hang out mostly he was alright and we finished up the conversation

89,1dp0yxi,AITA for Harassing My Husband About His Health,"TL;DR: I (30sF) have asked my husband (30sM) to take care of his health and wellness since we started dating, and now even more so since one of his family members passed away suddenly. AITA?

  
Hello, everyone. Sorry for the grammar and/ spelling. I'm on mobile. Two years ago, I started seeing my now husband. I love him very much. He's an amazing guy, very compassionate, willing to grow and work on himself emotionally, and we're always doing things to make our lives better. But there's one thing that really needs work. I have told him about him going to see a doctor regularly and going to get his teeth checked yearly. He pays for his own insurance and uses it for his psych appointments, but otherwise, he doesn't make use of it. 

I think it's important that he goes to visit a doctor and get his teeth done because he is clearly overweight, which isn't a bad thing, he's still very handsome to me, but I don't know how his weight is affecting his bodily functions, and he has horrible breath. I've told him a few times that his breath stinks, and he gets defensive and won't broach a topic of either brushing his teeth at least twice a day or going to see a dentist. He vapes, and I'm sure this causes some issues as well with the breath. I've looked up various ways to communicate this without malice or unkindness, but it really bothers me when he wants to get close and his breath smells... bad. I don't want to make a face when it happens but sometimes it's involuntary and he'll pull away and be sullen for hours at a time. 

  
I'm super obsessive about my personal health and do as many checkups and dentist appointments as I can during the year to prevent needing emergency health care (besides injuries I receive from my line of work or hobbies). Last year, one of his aunts died suddenly and it was because of health related reasons that tend to run in the family (heart disease). After this, I thought about losing my husband to heart disease *that we don't even know about*, and I was super dismayed and distressed.

  
Now, here's where I might be TA:  I told him I couldn't be with him long-term if he didn't start taking care of his health within the next year. We had an argument because, my husband has told me he has a phobia of dentists. I understand this and have even offered to help him look for trauma informed dentists. He has said he will do it, but hasn't made any   progress when I check in on him. It's the same with doctors, no progress when he says he'll look for a doctor. 

I don't want him to die from something that's entirely preventable and curable, and I worry frequently that his health will become a problem and I'll have to become a caregiver much sooner than I am able to handle. I wish I knew how to avoid scaring him but encourage him to take better care of himself. AITA?

90,1dp0p01,AITA for „hiding“ my MILs hurtful birthday present for my husband from him?,"UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM
My (f27) husband (m28) is clearly NOT the favourite child of my mother-in-law (f54). She has three sons and my husband is the oldest and only one not from her current husband. She separated from his father while she was pregnant and shortly after this met her current husband. After a while they became parents to both my husbands younger brothers (they are 6 and 4 years younger than my husband). The relationship between my husband and MIL is not really bad. She’s not evil or trying to hurt him but she just isn’t very affectionate towards him. All three of them moved away for university and my MIL sends packages of sweets, clothing or something like this to his younger brothers. My husband never received a package with the exception of his birthday. His brother got a brand new iPhone, two expensive pullovers and one Parfum for his last birthday. Similar to the other brother and I would guess most of the times for their birthday it’s something in this price range. She writes a nice card or a personal letter for them and sometimes bakes something like cookies as well.

My husband is sad EVERY year. It’s not about the money but two years ago he got a 40 Euro giftcard for an online shop - send via the online shop. I tried to talk to him about it but he’s so hurt that he doesn’t want to talk about it. I waited a few weeks and tried to talk to him again but he refused. Last birthday I gifted him a little vacation and texted my MIL that she could gift him a tour for one of the museums he wanted to see there (he dreamt of going to this city for years). It would have not been expensive but thoughtful and would probably made my husband happy. She said she already had something. It was a candle (he’s not very into candles) and a shower gel. 

This year a package arrived two days before his birthday. It was small and I could see that it came straight from an online-shop. We weren’t at home and our neighbour took it. When I came home my neighbour told me that I’m lucky to see him because he’s away for the weekend and we would have missed the package. I just knew it would hurt my husband. I asked him if he could keep the package a little longer so my husband would get it AFTER his birthday because it’s probably something disappointing from my MIL. He laughed and agreed. One day before his birthday I told him the package from his mom arrived but our neighbour was out of town. He had a great birthday - full of friends, lovely cake and gifts and didn’t think about it one time. Our neighbour gave it to him yesterday and made a joke that his dad is also bad at picking gifts. My husband got curious and asked him about his words and my neighbour told him everything. He talked to me (while his brother who was there for the party and stays with us for the week was present) and said he understood it. His brother told my MIL, who is now furious with me. She texted me and the group chat of his family lit up. She said that I’m mean and spoiled and had no right to hide the gift. So AITA?

Edit: English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry for my bad English. 

Edit #2: His brothers never said anything about the different presents. Now his brother said that he found it harsh from me to hide a present. My husband is „older“ and apparently that’s why it’s justified to not get expensive or thoughtful gifts. Funny enough - we are nearly 10 years together and he NEVER got a good present even as he was the same age his brothers are. One of his brothers also works (like him) so it’s not the job that makes the difference. 

UPDATE: Thank you for all the messages. I wrote in the family group chat a good mixture of what you all said. That I was just trying to save my husbands birthday because he’s been sad for years because of his presents that not match the energy of his brothers (and it’s not about money but about thought). I listed everything he got vs everything his brothers got. In return I got thrown out of the group chat. My husband left the chat after that. My MIL wrote me in private that I’m a toxic person who destroys my husbands relationship with his family but we choose to ignore that and go LC for a while.

He talked to me (while his brother who was there for the party and stays with us for the week was present) and said he understood it. His brother told my MIL, who is now furious with me. She texted me and the group chat of his family lit up. She said that I’m mean and spoiled and had no right to hide the gift. So AITA?

Edit: English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry for my bad English. 

Edit #2: His brothers never said anything about the different presents. Now his brother said that he found it harsh from me to hide a present. My husband is „older“ and apparently that’s why it’s justified to not get expensive or thoughtful gifts. Funny enough - we are nearly 10 years together and he NEVER got a good present even as he was the same age his brothers are. One of his brothers also works (like him) so it’s not the job that makes the difference. 

UPDATE: Thank you for all the messages. I wrote in the family group chat a good mixture of what you all said. That I was just trying to save my husbands birthday because he’s been sad for years because of his presents that not match the energy of his brothers (and it’s not about money but about thought). I listed everything he got vs everything his brothers got. In return I got thrown out of the group chat. My husband left the chat after that. My MIL wrote me in private that I’m a toxic person who destroys my husbands relationship with his family but we choose to ignore that and go LC for a while. ",0.0,0.9728469252586365,1,0
91,1dp0j4v,AITA for not having “special” dances at our wedding?,"I (20F) and my fiancé (22M) are getting married this summer and we both agreed we wouldn’t do any special dances, (like father daughter or mother son) because I grew up without a father and my fiancé said he doesn’t think it’s fair if he dances with his mom, because I don’t get to dance with anyone. My fiancé and his mom aren’t very close anyways because she is very manipulative and controlling. When we broke the news to her (40F) that there will not be a father daughter-dance or a mother-son dance. She broke down and started telling everyone that I’m trying to keep her son from her and that it’s his big day too. She told me “just because your father doesn’t love you doesn’t mean you should deprive my son and that very special moment from me” When my fiancé tried to explain to her that this was an agreement for both of us, she said that I have him brainwashed…I told her I didn’t care what she thought because at the end of the day it is my wedding, not hers. My fiancé and I have been together for almost 9 years now and we’ve been dealing with her since. So AITA, for choosing not to do these dances at my wedding?

92,1dp0dny,AITA for leaving my friend to sleep with someone?,"So I went alone to a festival a few weeks ago. While there I camped in a group of five and I was the only woman there. I got on very well with one guy, but there was another who was completely my type. Athletic and tall but I dunno he was kind of rude. He was also only 21 whereas i'm 28. I didn't really speak to him much.

So a few days in and i'm with the guy I got on well with. He was a few years older than me and I didn't get any vibes he was into me so it was refreshing for once. We went everywhere together. On the Friday when the main arena actually opened I received a text from the attractive guy, just asking what's up. We started texting back and forward and found out he found me ""fit"" (his words lol). Things got a bit heated and we started to send selfies to each other.

By Saturday I was still with my other friend watching a band and I got a text from the guy asking if he wanted to meet back at the tents, so I slowly moved away from my friend while the crowd was getting rowdy. I went back and had sex with him. 

After I met up with my friend and he asked where I was, but I didn't feel like saying anything. I had sex with the attractive guy again when everyone was asleep. And the next day I was hanging with my friend again like nothing had happened.

Last week while texting my friend he asked where I went for a few hours. Told him the truth. His response wasn't great, saying he feels hurt. Why? I didn't do anything wrong did I? Later he tells me he actually did have a crush on me which honestly made me quite mad. Not at him directly but why does **every** guy I meet always develop a crush on me?

94,1dp09sx,WIBTA if I throw neighbors under the HOA bus?,"Alright we can all agree HOA is the worst and never have I ever called them or used them against a neighbor but I don’t know what to do.  We share a section of grass located between the road and sidewalk. The previous neighbor and I shared the cost and removed the grass and replaced it with river rock. The new neighbors moved in about 3 years ago and I’ve never had issues with them, they keep to themselves and I don’t see/talk to them very much. A few weeks ago I came home to their yard and our shared section completely torn up (replacing sprinklers). They removed all the river rock and replaced it with sod in the middle of June in central Texas. They did this without any prior communication even though it is a shared section. They’ve been watering everyday so their sod is starting to green up but my section of our shared area is completely dead. When I tried to run the sprinkler it no longer comes above the ground and just puddles water. Im already being contacted by the HOA for the dead section. So I feel like since they removed the rock from my section and replaced it with sod without my consent that they should also repair the sprinkler head. I had no issues with this sprinkler head before they did this and my other heads function normally. Should I let HOA know the deal to avoid a fine or should I write them a letter asking for them to fix it? I rarely see them and I don’t have their phone number so I don’t have another way to contact them. I should also mention that the last time I spoke to them they told me they have already bought a new house and are getting ready to put this one on the market so I’m a little concerned they won’t care since it will soon not be their problem. 

Edit: yes, I did knock on their door and no response. I just ran the sprinkler and dug up where the sprinkler should be and the head appears to be gone. Thanks for all your suggestions!

95,1dozsfi,AITA for refusing to help my best friend pay for university after getting a large scholarship?,"I'm a prospective university student (18F), and I've been incredibly fortunate to receive a substantial scholarship that covers most of my tuition. This scholarship is the result of years of hard work, countless extracurricular activities, and maintaining top grades. My best friend, who has always struggled more academically, wasn’t as lucky. Despite his best efforts, he didn't get any significant scholarships and is facing a daunting financial burden to attend university.

Recently, he approached me with a desperate plea. He asked if I could use some of my scholarship money to help him pay for his tuition. He argued that since I have a lot of my expenses covered, I could afford to spare some of the money to support him. He promised to pay me back after graduation once he secures a job. I was shocked and explained that the scholarship money is strictly allocated for my education, and even if it wasn’t, I couldn't risk my financial stability on a promise. Even though my fees are covered I still need to work/find other ways to cover living costs and what the scholarship hasn't covered.

Since then, my friend has been distant and resentful, accusing me of abandoning him when he needs help the most. He thinks I’m selfish for not sharing my good fortune, and most of our mutual friends have sided with him, saying that I could afford to help. Now, I feel torn between my commitment to my own future and the guilt of not helping my best friend.

97,1dozowf,AITA for not believing my daughter when she said she hadn't criminally damaged any property? ,"HI so i am a F39 with a 17-year-old daughter Lillie. 

Last week Lillie and her friends caused some trouble in college, and she got kicked out, but they are going to help her finish her exams which they did yesterday.

My friend Nicola got a call from the college saying Lillie and her friends had criminally damaged property at the college but Lillie, Sammi and Leah {nicolas daughter} have all swore blind they haven't damaged anything. 

But Lillie is a troublemaker and always has been so i didn't believe her or her friends at the time. I've known Leah for years as she's been Lillies best friend since nursery and she's never once lied to me.

I just figured she would lie to keep Lillie out of trouble because the claims that the college made were serious. They said she had damaged cars and smashed the windows in. 

Lillie spent the next few days crying to me saying she hadn't done it and neither did Sammi and Leah, but she had done things like this before so i didn't believe her still, until yesterday. 

Leah's mum had gone into college and spoke to the head about the situation and told them to basically quit what they are saying and show her physical evidence what her daughter and mine had supposedly done.   

They didn't have any cameras outside and there was also no way any of the cars outside were damaged according to Nicola {leahs mum} so they lied to keep Lillie out of the college because it wasn't enough to kick her out for being loud, they had to try and physically ruin any chances she had at getting into another one after this. 



But what I'm asking is, am i the asshole for not believing her? 

she won't talk to me after i apologised and explained that she lied alot and they are some serious claims from a professional so of course i was going to believe them. 

she screamed at me and said she doesn't care what I have to say and stayed with Leah since.  

And also, don't send your child to small colleges that claim to want to help your children with their mental health, they are too comfortable around your kids and aren't professional enough.

Yesterday, I was on my way home when I saw another biker pulled up on the side of the road. I pulled over along side him to see if he needed help. He told me the frame on one of his wheels had bent. He said he lived a few minutes away and he could get his van, load the bike up and fix it at home.

He started mentioning how he was a disabled veteran, clearly expecting this to change my mind.

102,1doz33m,AITA for making a joke about the boy my friend has a crush on?,"It all started last week, but for some context: About two years ago, I joined a new school and made friends with three girls, let's call them A, B, and C, and they became my best friends. This year, all four of us changed schools; A and I went to the same school, while B and C went to different schools. It was a year of big changes for C, as she started working, dedicating much more time to her studies and the gym. The rest of us always tried to support her in everything since she was really focusing on her future.
Things started to get weird when she suddenly left our WhatsApp groups and other social networks, saying she needed some time away from things that distracted her from her goals. But up until then, I always tried to understand her side, although I was sad to see a dear friend asking for ""a break"" from us.
The main point of the story happened when C came back to the group to plan a hangout with us. One day, as soon as I got to school, A immediately asked me, ""Did you see what C sent in the group?"" I quickly checked what it was. It was a picture of a bouquet of roses, and C said she was super happy and nervous about receiving it. B asked who she got it from, and she replied that it was from a guy at her work whom she had recently met. While we were talking about it, I made the mistake of asking if he was handsome. Then C sent a picture of the guy. The ""guy"" was clearly MUCH older, and we're all 16 or younger. I'd guess he was at least 25. He looked like a grown man, and that's exactly what I said in my message right after: ""He looks like a grown man LOL."" A and B took it as a joke.

104,1doz1b3,AITA for telling my SIL it's not my job to step in and parent my niece and step-niece?,"My brother and SIL have been married for 8 years now. Both brought a daughter each into the marriage. My brother brought Mae (16) into the marriage and SIL brought Ava (15) into the marriage. The girls have never ever liked each other or gotten along. Everyone knows the two would rather do anything than spend time with each other. We have all been around when they fight. We have all heard them say mean and cruel things to each other. They're both as bad as each other. It stems from jealousy.

Mae doesn't like sharing her dad when she already lost her mom. Ava is jealous that Mae has a dad when her bio dad walked out on her and she's insecure about Mae being my brother's bio daughter even though she calls him dad and he calls her his daughter too. This makes Mae more jealous of sharing her dad.

We were always told not to get involved when the girls are being mean to each other.

Three weeks ago my brother threw a party to celebrate a very big promotion at work. He invited friends, family and people from work. At one point he gave a small speech/toast and he mentioned his amazing daughter Mae. But he didn't mention Ava. The girls had been fighting already during the party and when her dad said that, Mae taunted Ava that she's not really my brother's kid and no dad would ever want her. Ava was distraught.

When SIL found out about it she went crazy. Then when she found out I overheard she told me I should have stepped in and tore Mae a new one for talking to Ava like that and destroying her heart. I pointed out she and my brother always made it clear we shouldn't get involved. She said something like that is different. I asked her if the time Ava told Mae her mom didn't love her enough to fight cancer to be with her if that was different and I should have tore Ava a new one for that.

SIL said it was very different and no, I shouldn't speak to Ava that way but I should speak to Mae that way. She said Ava didn't deserve it. Then she told me I'm the worst kind of adult when I can stand by and allow bullying like that to happen.

105,1doyro7,AITA for opening up a case in civil court after my ex threw out my piano after he changed the terms for me to pick it up?,"So, my ex and I have a kid together. We were on good terms for a bit until a situation came up involving our kid.

About a month ago, I reached out to him to see if he could fix the power connector on a Yamaha keyboard I owned. It's one of 5 keyboards I have, but the oldest kid (not his) uses it for their piano practice when I'm at my mom's house. He agreed. I had knee surgery about a week after I had asked, and I brought it over two weeks after that. Normally I'm driving, but because of the knee surgery, I could not.

So, when I went to pick up our child, I brought the piano with me from my mom's house in an Uber for him to fix. I ended up staying that night, and he was able to fix it. The next morning we agreed I would pick it up when I was driving again because it was cumbersome to manage while I was in a full leg brace (and I was on crutches at this point)

Last week, he became upset with me because of a scheduling conflict between my two kids. I did try to work things out with him, but he threatened me rather than try to arrange a plan for the situation that had come up. On the day of the conflict, he messages me telling me I need to have my piano out of his house in 24 hours. I told him that was not possible, and reminded him that our agreement was that I would pick it when I was driving. He said I had to get it within 24 hours or he was throwing it out.

I told him if he did this I would need to open up a case in civil court. I warned him the value of everything was about $500. He went though and threw out the piano, despite me trying to arrange to pick it up literally the day after when I would be at his house.

I spoke to my family about this, and my mom is saying I have no right to ask for the value of the piano back. She is saying ""You can't just leave all of your stuff at someone else's house, and expect them to just keep it.""   Now, I totally understand  it if we didn't have an agreement in place, but we did and he went back on it.  I don't think he gave me a reasonable time to pick up the item especially since he only gave me 24-hour notice which I feel he was doing to ""punish"" me for the conflict between my kids  knowing I'm not as mobile as I usually am as I still couldn't drive. I expect to be able to drive sometime next week, which is the follow-up appointment for my surgery. If he had insisted, I would have gotten it literally the day after he had thrown it out, which is my normal day for getting my child.

So, AITA for going to civil court to get the value of the piano he threw out after he decided to change the terms of when I was to pick it up?

106,1doxu1j,AITA for telling my dad he's not allowed to give his speech at my wedding?,"My fiancée and I (both 20s) are getting married in a month and there's a dispute with my dad now and he claims I'm being unfair, but I wanted to get some thoughts on it. So dad decided he was going to give a speech at the wedding without saying anything first. He had shared the contents of said speech with his sister, my aunt, and she knew the speech would not sit well with me and mentioned his plan to me.

So in this speech he already wrote he talks a lot about how his wife is the love of his life, how amazing she is, etc. It's very similar to the speech he gave at their vow renewal 10 years ago. He hasn't shied away from expressing in front of me and to me that he never loved anyone like he loved his wife, how all his past relationships pale in comparison. And that includes my mom who was his first wife, who left him widowered with an 8 year old son at the time. To make it even more difficult to hear. The vow renewal was held on my 18th birthday and I got to celebrate my birthday by hearing dad talk about how mom meant nothing because his second wife was so much better. They were married 8 years at the time. But a lot of family and friends didn't attend their actual wedding and they decided they'd basically have a second one to celebrate and they decided my birthday was the perfect time to do this.

Anyway, the speech he wrote for my wedding had a lot of this content from what my aunt heard from my dad and read herself. She knew on my wedding day the last thing I needed to hear was how much he adores his wife when he does so in a way that basically said my mom meant nothing to him.

I told him I knew about the speech and he didn't have permission to give the speech at my wedding. Dad asked why not and I told him I didn't want him to use my wedding to praise his wife. He said she means the world to us so why would I say that. I told him she means the world to him. But she pales in comparison to my mom who meant the world to me and still does. I told him he might have decided mom meant nothing but that didn't mean I shared his feelings. He accused me of being sensitive and then said it seemed like I didn't care about his wife at all, and then he said she was a good mom to me for the 8 years she raised me. I told him she was never anything more than his wife. My mom died when I was 8 and I didn't get a new one. And the last thing I need to hear is how little she meant on my wedding day. Dad told me to be reasonable and the parents of the bride and groom typically say something. I told him nothing he had to say had a place at my wedding. That this is mine and my fiancée's wedding, not his. I told him to get married again if all he wants to do is praise his wife. But it was not happening at mine.

He told me to stop acting like a little boy and grow up. I left. Then his wife called crying about the fight dad and I had. Which led to dad calling me again and telling me to grow up again.

My fiancée and I (both 20s) are getting married in a month and there's a dispute with my dad now and he claims I'm being unfair, but I wanted to get some thoughts on it. So dad decided he was going to give a speech at the wedding without saying anything first. He had shared the contents of said speech with his sister, my aunt, and she knew the speech would not sit well with me and mentioned his plan to me.

So in this speech he already wrote he talks a lot about how his wife is the love of his life, how amazing she is, etc. It's very similar to the speech he gave at their vow renewal 10 years ago. He hasn't shied away from expressing in front of me and to me that he never loved anyone like he loved his wife, how all his past relationships pale in comparison. And that includes my mom who was his first wife, who left him widowered with an 8 year old son at the time. To make it even more difficult to hear. The vow renewal was held on my 18th birthday and I got to celebrate my birthday by hearing dad talk about how mom meant nothing because his second wife was so much better. They were married 8 years at the time. But a lot of family and friends didn't attend their actual wedding and they decided they'd basically have a second one to celebrate and they decided my birthday was the perfect time to do this.

Anyway, the speech he wrote for my wedding had a lot of this content from what my aunt heard from my dad and read herself. She knew on my wedding day the last thing I needed to hear was how much he adores his wife when he does so in a way that basically said my mom meant nothing to him.

I told him I knew about the speech and he didn't have permission to give the speech at my wedding. Dad asked why not and I told him I didn't want him to use my wedding to praise his wife. He said she means the world to us so why would I say that. I told him she means the world to him. But she pales in comparison to my mom who meant the world to me and still does. I told him he might have decided mom meant nothing but that didn't mean I shared his feelings. He accused me of being sensitive and then said it seemed like I didn't care about his wife at all, and then he said she was a good mom to me for the 8 years she raised me. I told him she was never anything more than his wife. My mom died when I was 8 and I didn't get a new one. And the last thing I need to hear is how little she meant on my wedding day. Dad told me to be reasonable and the parents of the bride and groom typically say something. I told him nothing he had to say had a place at my wedding. That this is mine and my fiancée's wedding, not his. I told him to get married again if all he wants to do is praise his wife. But it was not happening at mine.

He told me to stop acting like a little boy and grow up. I left. Then his wife called crying about the fight dad and I had. Which led to dad calling me again and telling me to grow up again.

107,1doxcoo,AITA for not telling ex-friend what he did?,"I am/was a female somewhere in the age range of 12-16. The person who did it was a male who was/is between 14-18. We had a notable age gap but nothing too significant. Us being friends didn't warrant any questions.

A while ago I invited him to my house and he did something really bad. I dealt with a lot of processing for this and it took me months to accept it as what it was, because I had a very black and white view of it. Also because of this, he didn't know that what he had done was bad.

Anyway, the incident left me with PTSD.

As it was happening, I managed to text one of our mutual friends, who we'll call Andy, panicking. Then, a few days later, I told another mutual friend, who we'll call Gracie, and who is like a sibling to me. Those were the only two people I told for a month, and then I told a friend who didn't know him well and that was it.

Gracie blocked him immediately and started referring to him as something bad. Andy didn't, but since he and I stopped speaking after the incident, they would sometimes feed me news about him and how he was. The other friend didn't tell a soul, but predictably Gracie and Andy told one person each whom they trusted, and I was fine with that.

But after a while it became clear that I would have to tell all of our mutual friends - we still hung out together as a group, so I was still very much in face-to-face contact with him, if not electronic - so I slowly began to do that. I kept the details scant. I made sure I shut it down whenever anyone called him something intense.

I shared it so that people would not feel like they had done something wrong and that was why I was suddenly distant. There are also a few people in the group who have dealt with that kind of thing, and I wanted them to know my side so they could make their own judgement. And that was fine.

But then recently Gracie told a large group of people out of the blue and used both of our names, so suddenly his reputation was being ruined. News got back to him that Gracie was telling everyone. He approached Andy to talk and explained that he was angry at the group for disliking him without explaining why.

Andy came to me and told me this and said they still had my back, but that I should speak to him. I said I was sorry because I felt horrible that they were bearing that anger, and they told me I could have handled it better by talking to him and telling him what he did.

Keep in mind that I was struggling with the PTSD and depression in the time that I should have been speaking to him. So at first I thought this wasn't right, because I shouldn't have to tell him what he did was wrong, but I just sat down and wrote him a letter in which I apologize for having been immature and selfish in my handling and I feel so humiliated and so guilty.

I’d go to family things, and immediately get told that I looked “hotter” and “better” and “prettier” like this, not too mention the comments on my brand new shape (I got big curves). So far so…good ig ? 
But no, it just angered me. Everyone was so focused on me looking prettier, saying I looked latina (I’m the palest person you’ve ever seen and I’m literally European, can’t be latina my dudes), that they never even cared about what I wanted to do in the future, things like that.

113,1dow7ro,AITA for playing a character in my D&D campaign?,"Throwaway account. Context, we're all in our 20's. Also, I am not the most socially adept person. Problem player will be called AB.

We’re all similarly experienced: <2yrs.

We had another session 0 a few months ago to talk about our feelings and expectations. Big thing the players told me was not to play against them as a DM. Something I began working on. Another one, being **not to laugh at them and invalidate them.** Which, I've *laughed at them as villains but in character*. And something I asked of the players was to *address issues with me when they happen, whether at the table or otherwise*. These terms were all agreed and for 4-5 months, things seemed to be going much better.

I got better at playing with them, not against them. Players even affirmed that many times. 

Session prior, all seemed happy. They felt the power fantasy and we were all getting along. 
Incident session last week, the group encountered the legendary BBEG-adjacent enemy. AB approached, taunting and being thoroughly rude and disrespectful to it. AB plays an arrogant character, and play them well, so I mostly disregarded it. 

Lore said BBEG was evil and arrogant. Yet AB decided to say “they’ll kill him before he has a chance to speak.” My response? I returned the energy and laughed as the BBEG-adjacent enemy and said “bring it.” 

We began a creature combat against 4 players and 4 allied NPCs. Each player was target over the next 3 rounds, and several were fairly damaged. But AB’s character was targeted in the first round, as they were the one who challenged the Oni. Well, AB got quiet and disconnected after being paralyzed in game. I texted AB several times throughout the night to ensure AB was okay and *asked if I crossed a line.* AB lied to me and said they’d had a stomach ache, they were bummed about being paralyzed, to which I replied saying “sorry” and that it was “all up to rolls.” After the session, AB even told me I was playing the character well and that my rolls and decision were fair. 

I knew they were ALL angry. No one would tell me why. My best friend simply packed up and left, and one of the other players said “well yeah, legendary fights are stressful.” They all said they were tired and the session was fine. Once more before leaving the host’s house, I approached AB and asked if everything was okay. They once again said yes. 

Next day, AB sent a message to our group chat and said they were dropping out because I was “an abuser,” and they never want to feel so targeted and small again. I reached out privately to apologize and try to talk about it and AB left me on read and screened my calls. My best friend left too, saying what I did was a “big violation of their trust in me,” and proceeded to drag me and insult me. The thing is, nobody addressed it to me in the moment.

Problem player will be called AB.

We’re all similarly experienced: <2yrs.

We had another session 0 a few months ago to talk about our feelings and expectations. Big thing the players told me was not to play against them as a DM. Something I began working on. Another one, being **not to laugh at them and invalidate them.** Which, I've *laughed at them as villains but in character*. And something I asked of the players was to *address issues with me when they happen, whether at the table or otherwise*. These terms were all agreed and for 4-5 months, things seemed to be going much better.

I got better at playing with them, not against them. Players even affirmed that many times. 

Session prior, all seemed happy. They felt the power fantasy and we were all getting along. 
Incident session last week, the group encountered the legendary BBEG-adjacent enemy. AB approached, taunting and being thoroughly rude and disrespectful to it. AB plays an arrogant character, and play them well, so I mostly disregarded it. 

Lore said BBEG was evil and arrogant. Yet AB decided to say “they’ll kill him before he has a chance to speak.” My response? I returned the energy and laughed as the BBEG-adjacent enemy and said “bring it.”

114,1doucus,AITA for freaking out at my mom's birthday party and saying I'm so tired of my family's shitty drama?,"My mom turned 60 on Saturday and we were celebrating her birthday at my aunt's house, my aunt is my mom's sister. So my parent both have kids through different relationships. My mom was married before she met my dad and lost her husband who is the father of Kevin, Anna and Henry. My dad wasn't married before but had an on and off relationship that resulted in Emma and Robbie. Emma and Robbie's mom weren't a part of their lives growing up. I think she left them when Robbie was still a baby.

My parents met 2 years after my mom's first husband died. They got married 18 months later and blended their families. I (16f) was born another year later. Emma and Robbie love my mom and they started calling her mom almost right away. They love my mom for being a mom to them when their own didn't want to know them. Kevin, Anna and Henry do not call my dad *dad* and they never really liked that mom and dad got married.

Emma and Robbie hate the other three because they don't call dad *dad* and they have made it their mission to tell moms kids how shitty that is. While Kevin, Anna and Henry hate dads kids for thinking they'd ever call someone else dad. Kevin and Emma fight the worst. Mom and dad know and have been involved in these fights over the years and have tried to make the family less blended and more of a family.

None of my siblings like or accept me either. For Emma and Robbie it's jealousy that I'm my parents bio kid and Kevin, Anna and Henry just see me as less than and hate that I exist because I remind them their dad is gone when they see me or think about me. So I don't really fit. I have siblings but not really because none of them would ever be there for me. They never want me around. Even when I try to support them if something bad happens.

That's the summed up version of the background. This drama still exists today. Emma and Robbie are still bitter at the other three for not claiming dad. The same old fight started at mom's birthday party and my parents were involved in it too. Some of the extended family were trying to join this exhausting feud as well. I just couldn't. I'm so tired of all of this. I ended up freaking out when I was mentioned and I told them to fucking stop already and I'm sick of the drama, I am sick of being rejected by both sets of siblings, I am sick of everyone acting like mom's kids are wrong for not calling dad *dad* when they love and remember theirs. I said everyone was making too big of a deal out of it. I said I hate being around them because they always fight, they always show how much hatred they have for each other and it's fucking stupid after all this time. I told them I was so over it all. And I walked home. My parents were so mad at me when they got home. Dad told me I abandoned mom on her birthday and mom didn't like the stuff I said. She told me my little freak out was awful to hear.

I’m F(Under 14) and I got into a very open relationship with my mom due to trust issues we used to have back then.
at this time she was telling my what real love was since I was having boy problems and I asked her if she loved my dad and she said she cares for him but doesn’t love him like how she used to.

My dad goes out with his friends a lot and is out “Making money” alot he was barely home most of the time and my mom was the one taking care of me and my brother.

at this time my dad was an alcoholic, and was smoking Alot he’s also what you would consider lazy, doesn’t pick up his trash etc.
My mom had at some point started comparing me to my dad. saying things like, “Your just like your dad” and this messed with me Alot cause I had previously had a talk with her about her verbal abuse.

she used to call me useless, bitch, piece of shit, etc and her saying that I was like my dad messed with me cause I knew how he acted and how he was I had a talk with my mom and she asked me why it was a bad thing to be compared to him and I wanted to say something without making my dad seem bad so I told her I pity him.

My parents had been arguing a lot and at some point my dad unhinged a door. My mom told my dad about how I said I pity him and she said I despised him which I don’t since he’s my dad and I love him but he talked to me about it but he was the only one doing the talking not letting me say my side. 

After all of this me, my baby bro, and mom moved into our grandparents house. my dad had told my grandparents on his side (so his parents) that I hated him. And he started pointing out my insecurities like “Why are you wearing so much makeup?” “You need to start eating more” he had even told family friends that I didn’t eat in public but ate like a pig at home(I cried but he doesn’t know)

116,1dot2l1,AITA for publicly explaining wedding etiquette and causing family drama? ,"Cast: 
Me 29F, my oldest sister Vivian 45F, my middle sister Kate 43F, my niece Ava 23F, my nephew Chris and his fiancé Lauren (26)

Background: 

My nephew Chris is getting married in August. The wedding venue allows 50 guests but our immediate family (my mom, sisters and all the grandkids) is a small group so it was assumed everyone was invited. 

This past weekend, I threw my mom a retirement party. I posted elsewhere about this incident but long story short, Vivian was supposed to help with decorations, proceeded to tell me she can’t help put them up but she has time to bring them over so I can do it. I ended up buying my own decorations so I could get it done without waiting for her. 

During this retirement party, Vivian refused to speak to me, look at me, nothing. During the middle of the party, Vivian begins handing out invites to Chris and Lauren’s wedding. She did not give me or our other sister Kate one. I didn’t want to say anything in front of my mom on her special day so I kept my mouth shut. Then I overhear Kate and Vivian talking. Vivian told Kate that she would be next up on the invite list if someone couldn’t come. I was then told that Lauren was having a bridal shower the next day and that I was invited to that but not the wedding. 

I’d like to add in that me and Vivian talked everyday until this point. I helped throw her daughter’s bridal shower, I met up with her often, there was no reason for me to be left out at this point. 

The asshole part: 

Not my finest hour but in a hurt state, I took to the Instagram, made a private story where only Vivian, Ava, Chris and Lauren and my other nephew could see it. I posted: “it’s very rude to pass out wedding invites when you know not everyone will be invited” and another one saying “it’s tacky and inappropriate to invite people to a bridal shower when they aren’t invited to the wedding. Learn some etiquette” 

I woke up the next morning to my phone being blown up, rightfully so. They stated that it was not right for me to post on Instagram. I immediately apologized and admitted my wrong. 

Ava texted me and started berating me. I explained my feelings and was told that “this is Lauren and Chris’ wedding, they can do whatever they want” and I tried explaining that while that is true, at what cost? Feelings were hurt and it sucks. 

My sister Vivian began texting my mom and said that she is coming after me, that I am evil and she can’t wait to watch me burn, that she is going to find my boyfriend and make up lies about me to get him to dump me, expose my childhood trauma, etc. Ava must have spoken with her mother because she began texting me all this too, along with “you ruined Christmas forever now because no one likes you and it’s better when you aren’t around”. When I told my mom what was being said, she confronted Vivian and Vivian told her I was a liar and that Ava never said that. I provided receipts and nothing has been said since. 

My mom is distraught with the drama. I know that I basically started it but was I that much of an asshole to get threatened and told no one likes me?

118,1dosz50,AITA with inlaws dog?,"Throwaway account

The world quite literally revolves around this dog. Its their little baby who is perfect. 

Untrained with no enforcement.

Husbands parents are retired and i feel like their dog now has attachment issues, no matter what the task - you have to be present for. 

When he has to be let into the garden to do his business, you have to follow and be next to him otherwise nothing happens and he will just not go for hours. No matter the time of day or what the weather is doing. 

Breakfast/dinner - it HAS to be heated, it HAS to be the right temperature or its not getting eaten, you have to bribe every single meal with his favourite snack and crumble it ontop. You have to stand there and watch him eat otherwise he doesnt. 

The barking! OMG the barking! He is untrained and will bark at absolutely nothing, some would say this is normal for dogs to bark at a leaf blowing by but this is something else, and guess what? He doesn’t know the word no so the barking goes on and on. Their neighors have actually put in complaints in the past about the barking, he has to go in the garden dead on 4am and 10pm and whilst one of the parents will be present in the garden, they don’t correct the behavior and just let it happen. 

My husbands parents live four hours away so if we have the take a car ride with the dog, he wants to be in the front no matter what, you’ll block him getting through which will make him stop but as you’re driving he will just bolt over the armrest and try to get into the front so hes with you which is dangerous in its own. 

We live in an apartment with neighbors all around and apartments being apartments, the walls and floors are thin. I am fortunate enough to work from home but my husband does not. When my husband is home and the dog is barking, he allows it because dogs are dogs and people who rent apartments have effectively signed up that its not going to be quiet whereas i want to respect peoples homes. 

I went outside once to wash my car and maybe left the dog 30minutes? Even though he could see me from the balcony that wasn’t good enough, as a result he went on hunger and poop strike. 

 I don’t have much of a social life but my husband however has quite an active social life so its mainly me who has to look after the dog during the day and evenings, this is one of the factors of why my husbands parents have asked for us to look after the dog - because they know i work from home therefore can be present for the dog. 

I get hourly update requests on how the dog is doing, if i don’t reply within the hour they assume something is wrong and blow up my phone so i just reply with one words now. 

In the future i want to say no to looking after the dog (albeit i have no reason too as i have a lot of free time but i want my free time to be my free time and do what i want to do)

After I thought he flirted, I confessed, but he did not reciprocate. Despite this, we became best friends and did everything together, including things that were more than friendly (hugging, holding hands, playing with my hair, wrestling, etc.). In April, I shared something personal with him, which he later mentioned in front of two other friends. I was infuriated and sent him a long, angry text, calling him a hypocrite and emphasizing my sensitivity and how much I value trust. After I sent that, he stopped speaking to me for 2.5 weeks, deleted his Instagram post with us, and only maintained our Snapchat streak with pictures of his ceiling and black screens. When I saw he deleted the post, I told him he was throwing away our friendship rather than having a conversation. Over the next couple of weeks, I reflected and realized my tone was more like a breakup text rather than an expression of my emotions. I later apologized and asked to talk, but he avoided me. I sent one final text, apologizing and expressing my guilt. After a few more days of silence, we had a conversation and both apologized. We were back to the way things were for a bit. However, when he moved out, he became very dry and I had to initiate all our conversations. When I addressed him unadding me on social media, he said he needed a break. He said he hung out with me because he thought he was ready to get back to the norm but there were times that showed we both hadn't changed. He said it wasn't fair to put so much pressure on himself and me to change for each other and that we were just too different to ever truly get along. I was confused. Never in our talk about the situation did we mention changing ourselves for one another. Also, if he really didn't think we ever got along, why were we best friends for 6+ months? Lastly, he misled me into thinking everything was fine. I responded wishing that he would've just told me this rather than unadding me on stuff and leaving me to guess and wonder what I did wrong. For the next couple of weeks, we continued our Snapchat streak but he sent me his ceiling and black screens like how he did before. I was upset and sent a final text, explaining that I loved and cared about him, but I was truly exhausted from overthinking, replaying things in my head, and trying to figure out what went wrong. I couldn't tell if he was just saying we were gonna talk and then slowly removing me from his life or if I was supposed to keep waiting for him. I apologized for what happened and the mistakes I made on my end. Although it felt like he threw it away, I explained that I will always cherish our memories and he was genuinely my best friend.

125,1doroao,AITA for telling my friend not to talk to me about the guy she likes? ,"My friend (24f) & I (28f) got into a disagreement over a guy & haven’t talked in days. My friend & I met 2 1/2 years ago when we became roommates. It was when my ex & I broke up after 8 long & toxic years. 
My ex is a legitimate narcissistic pathological liar & serial cheater.
When we first met freshman year of college, he told me his parents didn’t pay for his college like they did his twin. I would bring this up often & he never corrected me. It was only after 10 years that he finally confessed that was a lie. His parents DID pay for his college they just refused to pay for out of state like they did for his twin because they thought he would fail out.. AS HE DID, after one semester. 

I now have ZERO room for liars in my life.
I moved states, my friend & I talk for hours on the phone everyday & visit each other. She met a guy on hinge. He was 29, she really liked him because she claims he’s a good communicator & emotionally available. He was going away for graduate school & didn’t text often but she was obsessed. when he was visiting, he didn’t communicate & their plans fell through & she said that they should stop talking. He apologized & said he would reach out try again in time. She stalked him on fb & found out he’s not 29, he’s 32!!
They would have never matched if he had his real age on the apps. She confronted him & he said yes, I am 32 & he didn’t realize his age was wrong? When they first started talking he said he had been on the apps for 8 years. So for 8 years he’s never told anyone his real age? Or didn’t know the age was wrong? I don’t believe it. I told her if he’s lying about something so simple like his age…. What else is he lying about? She spoke to many people and she thinks it’s not a malicious lie so it’s ok. She started to disregard my experience & said they weren’t comparable because my ex’s lies were malicious. In the end, yes they were malicious, but in the beginning, no. It was as malicious as not telling someone your real age. My friend also said that her other friend is a therapist & her friend said it’s ok, so she is going to take her therapists friend’s opinion. I have a BS in psychology & was pursuing my PhD in neuroscience before I quit & switched to tech. I’m not uneducated. I said just because someone has a degree doesn’t mean they should & if a therapist says it’s okay that someone lies about something so simple like his age, she shouldn’t be a therapist. I think she said something neutral and my friend is twisting to her favor. My friend & I went back and forth a little bit and ended with her saying she doesn’t want to discuss this anymore & she won’t talk about him to me anymore and I said please don’t. I’m sad but if she’s going to continue to obsess over him, I can’t have her tell me about him, it’s extremely triggering & exhausting.

We usually do something like going to a museum or to a restaurant. I suggest we go to the zoo but then he offers to take us to Put-In-Bay, Ohio. It’s an island in Ohio people go to get drunk, seeing some historic stuff and have fun. It’s a very exciting place.

I assume this is what he wanted to do for father’s day by spending the day together. It’s the day of Father’s Day. He picks me up early and we go to the island. We get there and I think that we are having a good father’s day together. We are spending time together, We go to a bunch of bars. We go to this historical lighthouse place. We ride around the island.

The day is over and I think we just had a good father’s day. A whole week passes by.

i text my dad on the next monday, 7 days after Father’s day, and say “We should go get mexican food at some point his week it’s so nice out”. he doesn’t respond to my text. I get home and see him he doesn’t say anything. 

Tuesday the 25th I get this text from my dad

“I want you to know my feelings are a little hurt you did not get me anything for Father's day.  I had hoped you would have got or made me a card with your thoughts of me.”

Which I do feel sorry I didn’t get him a card but i just thought that that’s we agreed to spend the day together. I guess I thought that we spent quality time together and we celebrated 

So this whole entire week. He has actually been mad at me. and he hasn’t told me. and actually the reason he didn’t say anything to me or replied to my text is because he was giving me the silent treatment. and he was purposely ignoring me 

It wasn’t intention. I didn’t knowingly think “I won’t get my dad a gift”. I just assumed he knew money is tight for me right now.

He is loving but if i’m honest I have a hard time with my dad. We really don’t have the best relationship and i never felt like I could be myself around him. Growing up he would always get mad at me for having different opinions than him or thinking a different way about something.

128,1dorf1t,AITA for simply trying to give my kids a better life?,"I (F51) recently had a conversation with my oldest son (M22) that really made me start to reflect and look at our relationship in a new perspective, and it has me worried that I may have ruined things with him in ways that I’m not sure I can even fix.

For context, my husband (M62) and I adopted our 3 children out of foster care. They were relatives of my husband’s and we heard about their situation from his brother. At the time they were 9, 7, and 5 and were living down in California. They had been living with other relatives for a while, but eventually had to be moved to a different foster home, so we decided to come down from Oregon to visit them that summer and decide if there was anything we could do to help. After going through hell and back dealing with the social workers down there, they finally moved to live with us in December 2010, and were officially adopted in June 2012.

The adoption was closed and we made the decision to cut off contact from their bio family completely. Looking back, this seems to be where the issues began, but it’s what my husband and I thought would be for the best. We wanted them to feel welcome and included in *our* family, and since they moved in right before Christmas they got the chance to get to know their cousins and grandparents right away.

Fast forward to the past year or so, my oldest son now has a kid of his own and has been living with his fiancée and her family for a while. I’ve done my best to give him space and try to be supportive from afar, but so many of our conversations quickly turn into heated arguments where he would keep bringing up things from the past. I got tired of the fighting and stopped texting him as often, but I decided to reach out on the anniversary of the adoption to let him know I was thinking of him. He responded saying he had a lot on his mind as well and had wanted to meet to talk and figure out how to move forward. 

Getting to sit down and talk to him was very eye-opening. He asked me some things, but most of the conversation was focused on his experiences. He opened up a lot about his struggles growing up. How he didn’t know how to talk to me because he felt we never let the 3 of them talk about their past, and because we never put them into therapy to process anything they went through. He also explained how that’s why he’s been so resentful towards me recently.

By the end of it neither of us really knew how to move forward or fix things. All I want is for us to just leave everything in the past and move on, but he doesn’t seem to think that’s possible, at least not without some work on his end and going to therapy to process all that he’s been through- from foster care and from living with me and my husband. I only ever wanted to get them out of a tough situation, i never meant to make things harder for them. But now I can’t shake the feeling that I seriously messed up…",Asshole,2024-06-26,"AITA for simply trying to give my kids a better life? I (F51) recently had a conversation with my oldest son (M22) that really made me start to reflect and look at our relationship in a new perspective, and it has me worried that I may have ruined things with him in ways that I’m not sure I can even fix.

For context, my husband (M62) and I adopted our 3 children out of foster care. They were relatives of my husband’s and we heard about their situation from his brother. At the time they were 9, 7, and 5 and were living down in California. They had been living with other relatives for a while, but eventually had to be moved to a different foster home, so we decided to come down from Oregon to visit them that summer and decide if there was anything we could do to help. After going through hell and back dealing with the social workers down there, they finally moved to live with us in December 2010, and were officially adopted in June 2012.

The adoption was closed and we made the decision to cut off contact from their bio family completely. Looking back, this seems to be where the issues began, but it’s what my husband and I thought would be for the best. We wanted them to feel welcome and included in *our* family, and since they moved in right before Christmas they got the chance to get to know their cousins and grandparents right away.

Fast forward to the past year or so, my oldest son now has a kid of his own and has been living with his fiancée and her family for a while. I’ve done my best to give him space and try to be supportive from afar, but so many of our conversations quickly turn into heated arguments where he would keep bringing up things from the past. I got tired of the fighting and stopped texting him as often, but I decided to reach out on the anniversary of the adoption to let him know I was thinking of him. He responded saying he had a lot on his mind as well and had wanted to meet to talk and figure out how to move forward.

For the last 2 years all my friend group used to be in the same high school area but this year we got separated into 2. My friend group consist in 8 boys and 4 girls (including me). Now we start with the story.
So for the past 2 months 3 of the boys in the friend group have been making excuses for not hanging out with the rest of us, they always make up that they have “a lot of homework” or “are grounded” and more stuff. Me and my girl best friend are always trying to make them come to the plans, and always including them in everything even though the rest of the group is very annoyed at them. 

Last week we were planning to go and have a picnic in the forest and spend the day there. But because of bad climate we had to cancel last minute. The 3 boys in the friend group that have been distant, never answered, they didn’t even bother telling us they didn’t want to come nor anything, as always. So when we were all together not knowing what to do next, I saw my friends car passing by and had an idea, let’s go surprise them at the restaurant they are going so they see that we know they are ignoring us. we arrive at the restaurant and clearly they are there (with other friend group we are also a part of), and by fate we get seated in the teable right next to them, they decided to pretend we didn’t even exist, they ignored us the whole time and that hurts my feelings. The guys decided to go and say hi to them when we finished our meal but the girls and I were really hurt and just ignored them and got out of the restaurant. 

A couple of days pass by and I’m still really hurt about them ignoring us and being really distant so I uploaded a TikTok were I said, quote “life is good when you are only allowing good people into your life and you stop begging for people who don’t care about you” apparently this moved a nerve in my distant friends and they texted my best friend and said that I was a “bitch” for posting that and the rest of my friends say i look like the bad guy in this situation and I made a fool out of myself. 

I feel like it wasn’t inappropriate because I’m not talking bad them technically, also I feel really sad that people that I consider my  best friends ( 3 guys that are distant) can simply keep ignoring us and pretend like nothing happened.

130,1dorayb,AITA For kicking out my roommate?," Hi everyone, I really need some insight on this topic to see if I’m truly in the wrong  Let’s call my roommate O for this story.

 O F(22) recently moved in with me M(21) as I was in need of a roommate since my old one graduated college and moved back home. As O and I were talking before she moved in, she described how she’s a very chill person that doesn’t do much besides going to work and keeping to herself in her room. I immediately picked her since that’s how my old roommate and I operated and wanted someone like that. 

 Since then, it has been nothing but lies. Since she has moved in, I have gotten a noise complaint, and a violation from our property management company due to marijuana (She left her bong right in the living room). Not to mention, she has people in and out of the apartment every single day. Ranging from 1-12 people without even telling me. OH and the worst part is having loud sex with her boyfriend that basically now lives with us, when are rooms are literally right next to each other. My apartment has paper thin walls, so yeah, not very pleasant.

 This has only been one month since she has moved in, and since then, i accepted that this was going to be a shit year in this apartment.   

Now, I recently found out she hadn’t been approved yet by our pmc, but was living in unit with me under a roommate agreement she signed. After I found out she hasn’t been put on the lease yet, I took the opportunity to explain to my pmc what she has done while living here. 

This morning, she woke up to an email stating her application has been denied, and must immediately vacate. To avoid confrontation at first, I played dumb and acted surprised that this happened, but she found out I spoke to the property people (goddamnit). From this, I had to explain to her that due to the violations and complaints and the lying about the type of roommate, I can’t put myself in jeopardy for an eviction for someone I don’t even know. This caused her to breakdown and begging for a second chance, stating how she wouldn’t do anything again and would live by my rules religiously. I put my foot down and told her I can’t, because I had a feeling that the same patterns would start up soon.

I tried multiple times to set boundaries politely, and would half ass them. I definitely was a push over in some aspects and bit my tongue too much. Now, she is extremely upset with me and is accusing me of “tarnishing her name” with our pmc and can never rent from them again? Even though she is still allowed to rent from them, just not with me anymore? She moves out next week hopefully, and I’m covering her rent as a generosity to her since I feel really guilty about it.

131,1doqzzr,AITA for lying about a nut allergy because I don’t like nuts.,"I met my wife in 2007 and have been very happily married for many years. But when we first met, I told her I had a nut allergy which wasn’t entirely true at the time. I just really didn’t like nuts, peanut butter or anything of the sort. So rather than explaining to people that I don’t like nuts and have them ask why, I just thought it was easier to say I have an allergy. I never got tested as a kid and because I never really ate them, we all just assumed I was fine with nuts but just didn’t like eating them.

One day she gave me a muffin which had nuts in it and she realised after my first bite and smacked out my hands in fear that she was about to start an allergic reaction. Obviously at this point I had to come clean on the matter and she was pissed and felt like I had lied to her. Which, it was a lie but I just didn’t think it was too big a deal. 

Now, fast forward to 2024. For reasons unknown, I wanted to try an American style peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Actually really like them. But when I would ate one, I started to get a rash on my face and as it turns out, I am legitimately allergic to nuts. My wife was pissed at this discover and wanted to confirm with further testing, refusing to believe I am actually allergic.

So, AITA for telling my wife I was allergic to nuts?

EDIT: Ok, I concede that I am the asshole in this situation. But I would to clarify a couple things:

1. I’ve been with my wife since 2007, I said the lie in 2007 and she discovered the truth in 2007. Only took her a few months to catch me out.
2. My wife has never had to go out of her way for me ever since she discovered the lie. 
3. I’ve asked this question because it’s only been in the last couple months we’ve discovered that I break out in a rash from the peanut butter.
4. I’ve been with my wife since 2007…I must be doing something right if she has stuck by me for this long. Sarcasm aside, I do legitimately treat that lady like a queen and I am very lucky to have her in my life.

However, I would like to extend an apology to those who may have been offended by this. I know there’s a lot of people out there who have very severe allergies that can be very life threatening or worse. In 2007 I was quite young and just thought it was a small white lie.

132,1doqz8z,AITA for asking my friend to get a new towel for me?,"I was with some friends on a trip to Miami. After swimming at the beach, we returned to the hotel to shower. There were three of us but only one bathroom, so we had to take turns. The hotel provided six towels, and we decided to use three for showers and three for the beach.

When we got back, my friend A went to the bathroom first to shower. I wanted to go next, but my other friend, B, insisted he should go before me. We argued, but I eventually let B shower first.

I left my towel in the bathroom because there was nowhere else to hang it. After B finished, I went in only to find my towel missing. I asked my friends about it and realized B had used my towel. 

Surprised and annoyed, I asked B if he used my towel. He casually said “oops, sorry about that” and offered it back, but it was wet, so I refused. I asked him to get a new towel from the receptionist, but he laughed and said he wouldn’t do it. Thinking he was joking, I showered and then asked if he got the towel. I heard him asking A, ""Did he really think I’d get him a new towel?""

I was so pissed when I heard that that I started yelling and cursing from inside the bathroom until eventually A said “OK, let me get the towel for you”. I kept complaining from inside the bathroom because B was being unresponsible and he should’ve been the one getting the new towel from the receptionist since it was his fault. B thought I was being childish and dramatic for making a big deal out of that. He said he would’ve used the wet towel if I were the one using his clean towel. Easy for him to say since he was the one using my clean towel.

AITA for making him get a new towel for me?

EDIT:

B had already used his towel before we went to the beach and just put it somewhere, not even hung it properly. So by the time he was taking shower, my towel was the only clean and dry towel available.

Also, we were staying at Shelley Hotel in South Beach, Miami. It’s a walk up hotel and it doesn’t have a reception (i know).

We have no kids and both work from home, so we end up having lots of time to display affection towards one another.

This is important later, but as a child I was always braiding my friends’ and sister’s hair. I have always loved to braid and this carried on into my adult life. I developed a habit about 2 1/2 years into my marriage where I will make my husband’s armpit hair into a small braid, as he never really shaves them. Sometimes, he forgets to take it out for a while.

Onto the story, Russel and I were both getting some work done in the afternoon a few days ago, when my MIL (65f) called us asking if she could stay over with us, because she had found black mold in her bedroom closet and needed to hire someone to get rid of it. It was only for 4 days, and my MIL is usually very tame and kind, so we agreed.

She was over at our house in a few hours and we all had a good afternoon and night. I set up the guest bedroom for her to stay in, and we all ended up playing a few card games at the dinner table before bed.

While my husband and I were laying in our own bed watching a movie, I started to absentmindedly braid his armpit hairs.

At about 7:00 A.M. the next day, MIL was still asleep in the guest room and my husband was sitting at the kitchen counter while I made his breakfast. He did not have a shirt on.

MIL woke up right as I had finished plating breakfast, and I told her goodmorning and to have a seat so she could eat with us. She took a seat next to my husband and noticed his armpit was braided. Her eyes widened and she immediately started questioning him as to why with an aggressive and kind of disgusted tone. Once he explained that it was my doing, she went off on me. MIL started to say that I was disgusting and that my husband would have never let this happen before me, that he shouldn’t be with me.

Sometimes parents may generously give some teachers thank you gifts, but it really depends on the parent and the teacher. 

On the last day of school, one really kind father was thanking us profusely for the year. He was the last parent to pick up his child. Two minutes later, just as we were about to close, he came running back with one crumpled, used envelope, and inside was $500 cash. I was shocked and didn't know exactly who he wanted to have this, so I asked ""Who is this for?"" He said to divide it 1/3 between myself, Sharon, and Shilah. He did not mention Rebecca. However, normally the child's mother comes to pick him up, and communicates with the staff much more, so I was not sure if the father was aware that Shilah was absent and had a replacement. I did not bring the issue to his attention, and just accepted his instructions and thanked him, so we divided the gift as he wished. 

The next day Rebecca confronts me one-on-one when we are in the school to clean up. She said she had heard about the parent's generous gift, and said it was not fair that we left her out. She said she should be entitled to part of the gift since she worked with this child for the past two months, and asked if we could divide it into 4. I told her we already distributed the money and that the parent did not include her name when asked.

Initially, I moved to Atlanta, but a promotion took me to California over two years ago, where my cousin lives. We were close as kids but drifted apart as teens due to her meanness. I forgave her, thinking she had matured.

In California, I made friends quickly. My cousin, pregnant and newly married, complained about her lack of friends despite living there for three years. I tried including her in activities, but she often declined due to tiredness from her pregnancy, so our meetings were limited to me visiting her. At her home, she and her husband constantly fought. She admitted she could be cruel but couldn't control it. I felt sorry for her and tried to help, but visiting her became increasingly stressful. Her husband even called me late at night to vent about her, which made me uncomfortable and anxious.

I dreaded visiting her, experiencing nightmares and anxiety. After a particularly bad Easter visit, I started avoiding her, inviting her to group activities, which she usually declined. At her baby's christening, I noticed everyone was cautious around her. Her friends also made excuses to avoid her, and I felt obligated to stay connected because I was her only Argentinian family.

I invited her to fewer things, knowing she would decline. Once, she accepted an invitation to a play but accused me of not inviting her to enough events. This confrontation made me feel physically ill. I realized I couldn't continue this relationship. I discussed a transfer with my boss and learned of a position in Chicago. Not wanting to spend another seven months near my cousin, I lied, saying I was moving in three weeks, knowing she would be in London then.

I spent six months in California without her knowing, which was a peaceful time. I eventually moved to Chicago but felt guilty for lying. Despite our complicated relationship, I care about her and feel conflicted about my actions.

137,1doqbz2,AITA for stealing back my car?,"I (23F) cosigned and bought a car with my Cousin (30F) back in 2019. After my Cousin called her mom, sister, and my sister, she called me. My cousins reasoning for needing a new car revolved around the potential for breaking up with her long-term boyfriend, desiring to finally be independent from him. This wasn't the reason I signed for her though. Before the pandemic, I was struggling with severe depression and anxiety. At this point, I had a particular plan which meant if I signed for her, there wouldn't be any *real* consequence for me. Time moved on and things evidently changed. 

A little while after we bought the car, I had asked to borrow it for a few days while mine was out of service. My Cousin straight up refused. I don't remember *exactly* what she said, but it had something to do with how the universe was giving me a sign and how I should manifest better things for myself. A year into buying the car I ask to be removed from the loan and my Cousin blocked me. Not just from iMessage but from all social media. Months passed by before she apologized and unblocked me. At least a couple times a year since then, I would message my Cousin multiple solutions which would remove the car from my credit report (refinancing, removing myself from the loan, etc.) and was met with silence every time. At some point, my credit score dropped -125 points because she hadn't been making the payments on time. This wasn't the only time it's dropped, this was just the most it had while the car was in her possession. More recently, it's been hard to get an apartment with how low my credit score has dropped.

So I started making small payments on the car and formulating a plan. If the cops couldn't do anything because the car was both legally ours, it wouldn't be illegal to take it back. I booked a flight back to our home state (I had moved out of state shortly after buying the car), towed the car overnight to a dealership, and booked an appointment for a key fob replacement early the following morning, since they only gave us one key when we bought the car.

When my Cousin realized the car was gone she flipped. She had no idea I was in town but put it together immediately. The cops were called regardless and it ended up being exponentially more dramatic than I anticipated. I feel like the decision to take the car was already asshole-ish, but why I'm feeling guiltier is because my Cousin is pregnant. Her and her fiancé do own another car, but overall, I feel like an asshole. I don't mind returning the car if she relinquishes me from the loan, but she has since understandably gone no-contact.

TLDR: I cosigned a car with my cousin and when she wasn't making the payments on time/stopped paying for the car, I secretly took it back.

AITA for asking my partner to shower before getting into bed?

I (24F) have been dating my partner (24M) for about a year and half. Lived with him for about 6 months now. I do have diagnosed OCD, and I can’t help but wonder if that’s why I’m so bothered about the things he does?
He’s typically pretty messy.. spills drinks, steps on sauce packets, etc. he has severe ADHD so a lot of stuff slips his mind as far as organization goes, same with me but not as severely as him, but to add to that, his hygiene is beginning to get to me. He doesn’t shower every day, he doesn’t brush his teeth every day, he doesn’t put on clean clothes all of the time. The reason why I’m writing this post is because I have just now asked him (again) to shower before getting into bed with me. He rolled his eyes and had an attitude about it, but is doing it anyway. It’s one thing about me that has always been present is I firmly believe in clean bed sheets. I shower, no matter how long my day has been at work or whatever, I still do it. If my sheets aren’t clean, I have a hard time sleeping or even getting comfortable. He works in law enforcement, so he works minimum 12 hr shifts on a nurse schedule (alternating days: one week he will work weekends: fri, sat, sun, then skip mon and tues, work wed, thurs, skip weekends, then work mon, tues— you get it). Needless to say, it’s hot outside and he gets smelly at work. He touches random ass people who only god knows is however clean, doesn’t always get to wash his hands. Comes home after a long shift, and wants to climb into bed. But yall, i tell him nicely every time, “hey you smell kinda bad and i want the sheets clean. I just put a clean set on before you got home” and with an attitude, he will go shower. Sometimes he doesn’t even shower, and he will just take a BATH, but am I the only one that feels like a bath is just a lake of your dirty body juices? Like why would you take a bath if you are dirty?

143,1dopf1p,AITA for not letting my mom add everyone’s drinks to my tab?,"The other night some friends and family went out to a bar and hung out, my mom and I arrived together so I bought a first round and opened a tab. Through out the night I bought everyone at least one drink, casually like saying “who wants another” as I got one for myself. Eventually my brother and friends hop up and ask if anyone wants another round, everyone responded positively with their drink order. As he walks away, my mom chimes in “Redacted (me) has a tab open!”. I shot her a look and said “oh” reactively. 

With the friends and brother leaving it left my mom, my brother, my girlfriend, and me alone at our table. My mom said “my bad” and I said “I was just surprised you offered up my tab”. She said she didn’t realize we weren’t sharing a tab. I responded explaining how I thought it was poor bar etiquette to offer up a card that wasn’t your own. She got mad, stormed after my brother to cancel her drink and leave the bar entirely.   

I just got the opportunity to apologize, but money is tight and I didn’t understand adding to someone’s bill without asking.  She said I publicly chastised her and reiterated how she thought it was a “shared” bill; yet she never offered to pay towards it. 

Am I the Asshole for telling her it wasn’t cool to tell people to add 6 drinks to my tab without asking me?

",Not the A-hole,2024-06-26,"AITA for not letting my mom add everyone’s drinks to my tab? The other night some friends and family went out to a bar and hung out, my mom and I arrived together so I bought a first round and opened a tab. Through out the night I bought everyone at least one drink, casually like saying “who wants another” as I got one for myself. Eventually my brother and friends hop up and ask if anyone wants another round, everyone responded positively with their drink order. As he walks away, my mom chimes in “Redacted (me) has a tab open!”. I shot her a look and said “oh” reactively. 

With the friends and brother leaving it left my mom, my brother, my girlfriend, and me alone at our table. My mom said “my bad” and I said “I was just surprised you offered up my tab”. She said she didn’t realize we weren’t sharing a tab. I responded explaining how I thought it was poor bar etiquette to offer up a card that wasn’t your own. She got mad, stormed after my brother to cancel her drink and leave the bar entirely.   

I just got the opportunity to apologize, but money is tight and I didn’t understand adding to someone’s bill without asking.  She said I publicly chastised her and reiterated how she thought it was a “shared” bill; yet she never offered to pay towards it. 

Am I the Asshole for telling her it wasn’t cool to tell people to add 6 drinks to my tab without asking me?

Though the situation of being the primary money maker was meant to change, it didn't for almost a year and a half. 

The situation started to get toxic as every time I would return home, a fight would occur. I ended up moving in with my boyfriend and was then blocked by my mothers boyfriend. For almost two months, it was a problem as I still currently support the household. I started preparing to switch jobs and stop supporting them, which caused a larger argument to take place. After no contact, he reached out with a bunch of rude comments on my father's two year death date. My mother had consistently pestered me on trying to work things out, so I conceded.

He reached out almost every day, I had explained that i didn't want that much contact and that I would reply to him when I had time since I'm trying to get back into college and get my life together as well as the way I felt about everything that went down. My mother wasn't happy with my decisions as she wanted us to fix things. Every time he and I spoke, he insulted my boyfriend and myself. Which felt very disrespectful to me, I kindly requested he stop several times. Along with inquiring into my boyfriends business as my boyfriend requested he stop, he felt like his personal space was being invaded. I felt stuck in the middle trying to make my mother and my boyfriend happy. I finally settled for my own mental health.

I blocked him again tonight, I feel guilt as I don't know if this is the correct way to go.

147,1doowvn,AITA for Moving Reserved Towels to Sit with My Family at My Sister’s Graduation?,"My sister graduated high school today. Our school does their graduation on the football field. Seating is limited on the bleachers, which everyone wants to sit in because it has a canopy for shade, and the only other option is to picnic on the field to watch. Although there’s a no seat-reserving rule literally stated on the tickets, nobody has ever enforced it. People will go there in the early morning or the night before the graduation and spread towels/table cloths/painters tape on the bleachers with a piece of paper of their names, claiming a spot.

Went to the school with my boyfriend and my family. We got there an hour before it started so we could try and get bleacher seating amongst the sea of towels. My family got a spot in the same row, however, there wasn’t enough room for me and my boyfriend since there was a towel taking up the rest of the row. So we got a spot a few rows back. Around five minutes before the graduation started, the family reserving it was still not there. I decided we should just move the towels and sit there with my family. You can’t illegally reserve seats and not show up until five minutes before. We’ve been here for an hour. We went and sat with my family, and I slid their towels down to make room for me and my boyfriend. 

Just as pomp and circumstance started playing the family who had reserved the spot schlepped in. They realized there wasn’t enough room for their party of ten. The mother of the family looked and me annoyed and said, ""Excuse me, but we had these seats reserved. You moved our towels.""

I replied, ""I'm sorry, but you aren’t supposed to reserve seats, no one was here, so it was available.”

The mother said, ""everyone does it, and we’ve been doing it for years without any issues.""

I said back, ""Look, my family got here an hour ago. If you wanted these seats so bad, maybe come a bit earlier like the rest of us who want bleacher seating. It’s not fair to those who show up early to secure a spot with their actual body. If you had been here earlier, we wouldn’t have moved your towels.” 

The family huffed and continued to argue with me, insisting that their mother is elderly and needs to sit in the shade. I stood my ground, saying, “I’m sorry, but there are no-reserving rules for a reason. If the shade was that important, you should have been here earlier.”

They eventually stopped arguing with me and found seats elsewhere, but now I’m wondering: am I the asshole for moving their towels and taking the seats?

Again, I was given EXPLICIT permission; she is helping me write it. My friend will be called Abby, and her boyfriend will be called Nate. All fake names. In the beginning, it was a situation ship; we are all in college, and they both wanted different things. Nate wanted friends with benefits, and Abby wanted an actual relationship. Abby told Nate that this wasn't healthy for her anymore and that she wanted to cut ties, but then he changed his mind on the spot and said he was willing to work on a relationship. So they date, and red flags are popping up. It started with talking about his past relationships, making Abby uncomfortable, and turned into Nate ignoring Abby when his other girl friends in the friend group were near or texting him, whether in social gatherings or worse, when it was just the two of them. As the relationship progressed, when Valentine's and their 6 month anniversary came, Nate chose to go out partying without Abby. That just scratched the surface; there are more red flags, but bigger things are left to address, which takes us to our current dilemma. This issue has been ongoing for three days. So the trigger for it was on day one when Nate went into very explicit detail on a hookup he had; despite Abby saying it multiple times in the past and repeating it when Nate brought it up, Abby said it was very unnecessary. On day two, when the two of them were in bed, Abby saw Nate look up on Twitter very explicit POV content; Abby didn't say anything that night, preferring to go to sleep and address it the next day. For context, Nate said to Abby before he had an addiction to corn and, for a month, disengaged from physical activities with Abby. He follows multiple accounts that produce only fans' content to this day. On day three, Abby talked to Nate about what happened on days 1 and 2. Abby talks about how she knows he won't change overnight, and that's ok. She just wanted to set some boundaries so he could do his activities without her being there. Nate said that was a lot and that he wouldn't change overnight. He continued to say that he needs time to figure things out, that he feels like he takes advantage of Abby when in bed together because of that corn addiction, and he can't say I love you anymore.

I recently had to stop in 2023 due to it causing panic attacks and derealization when I’d smoke even the tiniest amounts. My bf (20M) has been smoking since around the same time, we used to smoke together before I stopped and does not have the bad reactions I now have, so he still wants to smoke.

We recently moved in together into an apartment. My bf has not smoked in a few months because he had to stop smoking for work (drug tests). He is thinking about quitting this job which means he has been thinking about smoking again. At this point my relationship with weed is not particularly good. Every time I smell it or am too close to it, it brings me massive anxiety. I have friends who do it and it’s really only the flower itself (the stinky stuff) that brings me anxiety. Weed pens or edibles, even wax (if smoked in a ventilated area) are fine. I have zero idea what triggered this anxiety in me. I miss being able to smoke and relax but I simply CANNOT anymore. I just cannot be around it too much and do not want it or the smell of it near me or our apartment.

So this brings me to my question: AITH for trying to compromise with my bf and asking him to give up the flower (at least around me and our apartment) and asking him to switch to pens, edibles and/or wax? I even have a Puffco peak pro he can use from back when I used to smoke. Just wondering from maybe other people’s POVs who still use MJ.

Now, whenever my mom isn't around she'll tell me that my mom can't cook.  
I always thought to myself, ""well if you don't like it don't eat it."" Now here's where our conflict began. It was at dinner time after my mom gave my aunt some potatoes and steak. She sat down at the couch while my mom gave me soup she had just made for my brother who's sick. I go sit on the couch with my soup, and this is when I heard her say ""its overcooked.""   
  
  
Referring to my mom's steak she had made. I then said, ""then don't eat it."" We had gotten into an argument, and I just was upset and tired from hearing her say my mom's food is either undercooked or overcooked. I proceeded to tell her that it's rude to say that, and if it's so bad why do you eat it? She then said that she doesn't always eat it.

  
During the argument I was yelling because I was hurt, which I do think was wrong, and I said ""fuck this."" when she thought I said fuck you, and she got even more upset. She told me ""don't talk to me like that"" I told her I didn't curse at her, and she told me not to raise my voice higher than hers. I told her I wouldn't curse at her, and I told her that if someone were to tell you, you can't cook or clean how would you feel? My aunt said she can cook and clean (so basically it doesn't apply towards her?) I also told her if my moms a bad cook why don't you teach her how to cook and she said she won't. She told me she wasn't stupid and that I knew everything and was smart. in a sarcastic manner. I said I don't think I'm smart, and she then talked about her family how she gives them everything, and how when my mom didn't have money she gave her money for food, and etc. So, the argument sidetracked and she said I kept going on. I do admit I kept going on about it, but I wasn't really given an answer, and I felt like I was the bad person, so here I am.

However, there was one person I did get along with.  Despite that, I wasn't interested in the club, as I had drama with the officers, but the person I got along with didn't know about our drama.

In recent days however, he questioned me about why I wasn't active in the club, and I initially gave pretty vague answers, because he was really close with the officers in the club I had drama with, and I wasn't sure if I could trust him or not.  However, I decided I would trust him, on the condition that he promised confidentiality and that he wouldn't disclose that we had a conversation.  I came clean with him and told him my side of the drama we had.

However, the next day, I got a phone call from him where he basically called the officers I had problems with, and he berated me for ""lying to him"" and ""only telling my side"".  Even after he promised me confidentiality, he did it anyways.  However, again, he was close with the people I had problems with, and I wasn't sure if I could trust him.

There was a university club I was in a few years back, where I didn't get along with a lot of people, especially the officers.  However, there was one person I did get along with.  Despite that, I wasn't interested in the club, as I had drama with the officers, but the person I got along with didn't know about our drama.

In recent days however, he questioned me about why I wasn't active in the club, and I initially gave pretty vague answers, because he was really close with the officers in the club I had drama with, and I wasn't sure if I could trust him or not.  However, I decided I would trust him, on the condition that he promised confidentiality and that he wouldn't disclose that we had a conversation.  I came clean with him and told him my side of the drama we had.

However, the next day, I got a phone call from him where he basically called the officers I had problems with, and he berated me for ""lying to him"" and ""only telling my side"".  Even after he promised me confidentiality, he did it anyways.  However, again, he was close with the people I had problems with, and I wasn't sure if I could trust him.  He called me a liar and told me he couldn't tell if I was lying to him or not, and he said we were no longer friends, then he blocked me on social media.

I asked her to stand on one foot ( she did for about 1 second) then said, you know I have bad knees. After a bit she said she was going to pick up her kids (age 9 and 12) at their dads. I asked if she really thought she should be driving.  She said she was fine.. We got into an argument. My mom was there so she went to get the kids.

153,1donsmb,AITA for telling my dad I’d rather be alone than be with someone like him? ,"Im 25F.  I work as a teacher and absolutely love my job. I get a tremendous sense of purpose from it and love my students. I am also earning my master’s and had a 4.0 last semester. I also am learning harp, and wrote a short story that was a finalist for a relatively prestigious award recently. I’m also autistic and was diagnosed when I was 8. I stim by flapping my hands and know an uncomfortable amount about Ancient Egypt. Regardless, I have friends, a job, and interests and I feel like I’m doing pretty alright for 25. Also full disclosure, my dad and I have an acrimonious relationship but I still talk to him for my mom’s sake (wanted to be upfront in case of bias). My dad doesn’t like Taylor Swift because she doesn’t have kids (I’m not like a mega swiftie, but that’s a glimpse of his mindset). 

Recently, my dad told me that I shouldn’t shake my hands anymore because “the autism is a turnoff.” He doesn’t want me to be alone. I told him that even if I do wind up alone, I have a pension and will be able to support myself. He said that he wants me to be happy and I said I would be happy with a partner who embraces my autism, rather than someone I constantly have to mask around. I also got pretty angry and said that I don’t care what’s a turnoff to him, that I don’t want to hear his constant input on my life anymore, and that I love him, but I’d rather be alone than with someone like him. 

The last part seems to have really gotten to him, and I understand that it must have been devastating to hear. It’s just that I’m so exhausted that I don’t care at this point, and I feel like it’s true. My mom asked that I apologize because she says he loves me (I know he does, but he’s just a flaming dickhead and it’s hard for me to care). Out of principle, I don’t want to apologize (especially since he hasn’t apologized to me), but I understand it might have been extremely unnecessary and sometimes you have to give an inch to keep the peace.

However, they have both confessed to me that they have slept together  many times over the years and don't care about me knowing bc they know the family will not believe me.

It tore me up mostly because it's my sister and my cousin. Also my sister was doing s*x work and having unprotected s*x at the time, so my anxiety was through the roof that something was going to happen to the cousin being cheated on.

I actually went No Contact for years, came back, and the affair was still a secret and my sister was using every family opportunity to be mean to me ""mom always liked you better, you got everything, your son is treated better than my kids"" etc.

One day she says in the group of cousins, the one being cheated on included ""I keep secrets but I know AITAsgardian doesn't"" so I say ""dude if I were to tell your secrets you'd be fucked"". To which she pulls me aside, asks me why I'm bringing up old stuff. I tell her to stop being mean to me publicly and Im not going to take it anymore. Another occasion she says ""AITAsgardian keeps threatening me saying if she were to tell my secrets I'd be fucked"" in front of family and cousin again. I pull her aside and say if you say it again, I'm going to make her explain what it means.

Well, we are having dinner at my uncle's house and she's roasting me all night, per usual. And she does it again ""she keeps threatening me saying if I were to tell your secrets you'd be fucked""

At this point I had it, I told her that the next time she did that I'd told her I'd make her explain it. She says she has no idea what I'm talking about. The cousin is confused. The uncle is screaming at me telling me to shut the fuck up. I'm crying. I ask for my keys. No one will let me leave bc they say me and her need to work this out. 

After cussing me out, my uncle tells cousin that sister and cousins husband have been fucking but it was a long time ago (not true).

Cousin texts her husband. Husband calls cousins mom crying. And I get cussed out again on speakerphone asking why didn't I keep my mouth off the husband. And that I'm not shit.

The next day I get cussed out by different members of the family. I get told I ruined the family and that if the husband unalives himself that it's my fault

So I snapped. A lot of people knew about this affair and did nothing. I posted to Facebook to get my feelings out about what happened. I set it to a limited audience so only people who knew about it would see it. However, a different uncle, who also knew about the affair for years, screenshotted it, and sent it to the cousins mom.

**edited to remove emotional cheating because it’s not what the focus is**

I 24F and my boyfriend 23M recently moved in together. We’ve been dating for under a year, but combined with our prior dating experiences and experience together, we went for it. Him and his ex (dated for six years) decided he wouldn’t be kicked off her streaming services after the break-up. I was fine with this, because I didn’t have HBO Max in my arsenal. Fast forward to a couple months ago, and I got tired of buying GOT episodes on Prime so we could watch at my place. I got a subscription to Max and added my family. My partner however, is still on his ex’s account. Now that we’ve moved in together and we watch shows together, I’d rather be watching them on my account-not to mention I don’t like the daily reminder of her when I watch my shows, or the fact that she definitely knows he uses her account and I can see that being a feeling of power (?). I asked my partner to sign out and sign into mine, explaining it made me uncomfortable, and he told me I was overreacting and he didn’t understand what the problem was. He even tried to say it was the same thing as me having a FB post of my ex from three years ago still up. Why is there any pushback at all? So y’all tell me: is this a big deal? Should I stick to my guns or admit I’m making a mess out of nothing? Is it the same as not deleting a post of my ex?

Both of our exes are definitely aware of our relationship in some respect, but we’ve been quiet about official posts and the move-in.

My partner however, is still on his ex’s account. Now that we’ve moved in together and we watch shows together, I’d rather be watching them on my account-not to mention I don’t like the daily reminder of her when I watch my shows, or the fact that she definitely knows he uses her account and I can see that being a feeling of power (?). I asked my partner to sign out and sign into mine, explaining it made me uncomfortable, and he told me I was overreacting and he didn’t understand what the problem was. He even tried to say it was the same thing as me having a FB post of my ex from three years ago still up. Why is there any pushback at all? So y’all tell me: is this a big deal? Should I stick to my guns or admit I’m making a mess out of nothing? Is it the same as not deleting a post of my ex?

Both of our exes are definitely aware of our relationship in some respect, but we’ve been quiet about official posts and the move-in. I get they spent six years together, but I’m ready for this phase of our lives. He thinks I’m too dramatic when he brings her up and that he’s “not allowed to talk about her.”",0.0,1.0421265363693237,1,0
161,1dombhe,AITA for not giving a shuttle seat to a flight crew ,"I was at an airport hotel for a conference. Upon arrival, it took an hour of jerking around for the hotel shuttle - it only held six passengers. A number of co-workers got bumped for flight crews going to the hotel. 

Upon checking out, I asked to reserve a shuttle seat. The front desk said it was first come first served. Knowing the issues upon arrival and that it held only 6 people, I was first in line, 10 minutes early. I boarded as did 2 pilots.  One pilot counted the seats, talked quietly to the driver, who told me to get off as 4 flight attendants were coming down and  needed the seat. I refused, as I had a flight to catch, was there first, and got screwed on arrival so asked the hotel how things worked. 

The pilot bullied me and claimed his airline reserved the whole shuttle.  I asked the driver to get the manager to sort out the “first come first serve” policy vs the pilot’s claim of reserving the whole van. The pilot backed down and we left behind 2 of the crew. 

So, should I have given up my seat?  I was burned on arrival, so asked the rules, planned ahead and got on first. I recognize the hotel probably has a contract to transport the airline crew but the root of the problem is a 6 person van for an airport hotel.
