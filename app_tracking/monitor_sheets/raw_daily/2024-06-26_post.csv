0,1doozgy,AITA for telling my son's birth mom that she's more like a sister?,"I adopted my son when he was born. It was an open adoption but the birth mom (Beth) was so greatly ashamed of being a teen mom that she didn't follow up on any contact. Which was fine because I had no intention of involving her too much. 

The truth is that Ethan grew up with two dads and three older brothers. We always try to have him spend time with girls. A couple of years ago when Ethan was 9, Beth reached out to see how he was doing. I think she spent the last nine year being an overachiever so she'd feel worthy of having a relationship with Ethan. Ivy league, married a hedge fund dude, yoga, etc.

Ethan is incredibly self aware and intellectual. You cannot bullshit him so he and I enjoy a very open relationship. I told him his mom reached out to me and asked about him. I emphasized that she didn't forget him but she had to go away to work on herself. I asked how'd he feel about talking with her and he said he was open to it. 

They have a good relationship and spend time together. He's met her husband. It's been a good thing to know his bio family. 

Ethan is starting 6th grade and he has to pick an elective class. There has been arguments about what that class will be. Anyways,he told Beth about it and she fucked up by getting involved with the matter. She said what's the big deal about his doing yearbook. He should do what he wants to do. It's his class.

I was like you got me fucked up. I said girl you are not his mom. You're more like a siblings and siblings don't get a say in parenting decisions. You take a backseat. You're a seat filler in the life of Ethan. Just don't forget your place. 

She didn't say anything and went radio silent. I was the bigger person and reached out. I said I've been raising that kid for 11 years so it was triggering for you to give your two parenting cents. You need to understand that. He understands that so you should too. 

I guess she's waiting for ME to apologize for something she did. I will not.

Heres the context; a friend of mine, we will call him Jon and his girlfriend, we will call her Jane, have a child one month older than my daughter who we will call O. O is about to be 6 months old in the coming days and has been a trooper about her milestones and over all strength, meaning she has a regular high chair at 5 months, been sitting up in the tub since she was 4 months 3 weeks old, and started rolling consistently at 4 months old.

Jon and Jane got angry with me saying im pushing my child to grow too quickly all because their kid, we will call them A, is delayed in their milestones and overall growth. A was born on time not early or anything but they were a bit on the smaller side. Not dangerously small but still little, meanwhile O was born at 9 lb 1 oz and she has been steadily gaining weight since. 

Now onto where i might be the asshole. When Jon and Jane started lecturing me on how i am a bad parent because i let my child grow too quickly i snapped. I yelled at them and said the only reason A is so behind is because they leave A in a pack and play all day long with a tablet 6 inches from her face. Currently A is 7 months old in 2 days. A is incredibly behind in growth, isnt hitting any growth markers, and has almost zero neck strength. I told them that if anyone was a bad parent that it was them not me, i work with my child on her strength and development every single day. We spend hours on the floor practicing rolling in every direction even though she is able to roll (she favors right to left so im trying to get her use to left to right rolling) she watches 1 hour of cartoons on mondays when I need to make phone calls to doctors and insurance but other than that one hour, O is either working with me on her overall strength, being read to, or independently playing.

2,1domhf3,AITA for asking my brothers to not pee with the door open?,"I (18M) have 5 brothers that range between 24-14. Most live in the house, and the ones that don’t, still often spend a lot of time here. As I said, I have 5 brothers, so any crazed activity that you can think of happens in my household. 

My brothers often pee with the door open, and it makes me uncomfortable. The bathroom is also built to where you can see what’s happening if the door is open, so it’s sort of disgusting. I mean, I get we’re all brothers but have some decorum. I’ve brought it up before, and they dismissed me saying that I was immature. They’ve continued doing it, and I’ve sort of ignored it. 

Well yesterday, my girlfriend was over and we were resting in my room, until we decided to leave to get dinner. We were walking down the hall, and we heard whizzing in the toilet and the door was wide open. I told my girlfriend to stay put, and I went to the bathroom and quickly shut it, not paying much attention to who was in the bathroom. My girlfriend and I then left the house and went to dinner. 

When I came back home, all 5 of my brothers were in the kitchen as I walked in, and they started coming at me. They were saying how I was immature, and I need to grow up. I then got slightly defensive, and I started getting a little loud telling them how it’s disgusting, they have no decorum, and I don’t want to watch them pee.

3,1domfhs,AITA going by my sister’s rules,"This is is such a trivial matter but we managed to have a fight about it… drum roll please… shopping. Classic sister fight.

We were out shopping and she found a dress that was cute and I said “yeah thats cute I want it” and she immediately snapped at me saying “I saw it first” and then took it, walking away from me. We usually go off of this rule so I let her have it and didn’t have a problem with this.

In the next store later she saw a clock that was a really nice decor piece and she said it was cute but then didn’t pick it up so I figured she didn’t want it and grabbed it. She said the same thing once again, “I saw it first” and I replied with, “You didn’t want it though.” And she agreed and walked away. I knew that if she truly wanted it she would snap at me like she did earlier.

Then later, in a store 30 mins later I found two earrings first, and told her that I liked them. She said she wanted them but I told her that I saw it first and that I wanted the first pick but then she can have the other pair. I still wanted to her to have one of them. We happened to like the same pair and I said it’d be my pick since I saw them first. And then she started full on fighting me saying that I was being unfair?

She brought up the fact that I “took” the decor piece from her earlier when she didn’t even tell me that she wanted it? If you see it first and want it then its yours. 

She only expressed that she wanted the clock to after she saw something I found first. 

Even then, I was letting her have the other pair of earrings that I found first to be nice.

Anyway, the fight was very small and over that she withdrew her invitation of my and my friends at her birthday party that I was planning for her….

Which made me laugh because it seriously isn’t a big enough deal to pull all of that. I told her I don’t care and I wouldn’t want to celebrate her anyway after this. She then called me a narcissist that doesn’t care about anyone. I kept explaining to her that she agreed with me about not wanting the decor piece and that she could have it if she wants, but then she full on p*shed me in the store. Which is when I told her we should have kept her on the bpd meds 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ & now shes crying like a baby to everyone. She even texted her gc of friends and I told her that I hope she feels pathetic for having to lie to them for sympathy. She was sobbing while I was just chilling and she keeps calling me a narcissist for that. I honestly think Im so used to her tantrums that Im unphased by what she or her friends think of me.

She says she doesn’t have money to drive over, spend the night in a hotel, and then drive back. This is not completely true as she drives past the city I live in often to go to the beach that is an hour and a half from my house. She has gone to the beach at least 5 times since my son was born. 

She called me the other day to explain that she felt I was keeping her grandson from her and it wasn’t fair that my mother in law has seen him about four times. She was upset and called me selfish and should think about how she feels. Note that MIL lives a 19 hour drive away. I explained that MIL got a hotel with a friend and she hasn’t spent the night either. I’m not stopping her from visiting. Just stopping her from spending the night. 

Am I really the one in the wrong in this situation?",0.0,0.017675322,0,1
9,1dol82i,AITA for not letting my partner cook chicken on the grill?,"I meticulously marinate and season the meat. I watch over the bbq pit and make sure everything is set to the right temperature. I tend to the whole cooking process while my wife 'prepares' the sides... usually.

I happily eat her under cooked sides and tell her they are delicious but I refuse to eat anything she prepares that could cause a food born illness. 

Examples of her cooking: raw meat loaf, raw and soupy green bean casserole, wet cornbread, under cooked potato soup, under cooked rice, etc. 

BUT...

She asked to do the steaks this time because she had, and I quote, ""already mastered the sides"".

I cant critic her cooking because she becomes extremely defensive, so I've never tried after I told her she made raw meatloaf, I've just decided to try and ""I'll help you with that"" with all parts of meals that could cause food poisoning. I'll happily shovel her gruel down my gullet with some things but not with chicken!

  
I've tried to suggest cooking channels or recipes but she just wings it, but she doesnt know wtf shes doing!

Even if the food wasnt always under cooked, it wouldn't have a good flavor (if any). Its been 11 years of this.

AITA for not liking my sweet wifes awful cooking?
