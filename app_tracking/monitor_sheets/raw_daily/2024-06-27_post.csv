1,1dpts8i,WIBTA for refusing to buy a late birthday gift for my son's classmate? (UPDATE),"The main piece of advice I got when I first posted here (or at least the one that stuck with me the most) was to buy a smaller, inexpensive gift for James. I was more than fine with doing that, but I had no idea what he liked. I also didn't want to give him that gift during his brother's birthday party, as that didn't feel fair to Mikey.

My wife and I talked, and we settled on getting James a gift card to a bookstore. We also had our older son give it to him at school, days before the party. He said James was grateful.

Later that day, the boys' mom texted the mom groupchat saying she didn't want people ""cheaping out"" on James just because it wasn't his birthday. My wife agrees that it felt targeted, but we can't prove anything. Either way, we've given him a gift. We don't need to indulge in this any more than we already have. We'll just complain to each other.

Our younger son wasn't uninvited from the birthday party. I was working, so my wife took him. According to her, the party was clearly Mikey's. The only thing indicating otherwise was the fact that James opened his gifts during it. 

My wife said she avoided their parents, but did get a few dirty looks from them, specially when Mikey opened the gift my son had picked out. It was a Spider Man toy car that he thought Mikey would like. We'd bought it before this whole fiasco. Since we actually know Mikey, it was more personal than the gift card.

I still don't understand a single decision the boys' parents made, but I'm glad my son's friendship is intact. I just hope my wife and I don't need to interact with that family too much in the future.

2,1dpnskd,AITA for blowing up at my mom for purposefully searching up my bsf’s deadname?,"English is not my first language, I’m writing this on mobile, not in the US, all that jazz, so please excuse any grammar or spelling errors.

I (19NB) have a best friend of 5 years (20MtF, we’ll call her Eevee), who is trans. Eevee hasn’t used her deadname in years, but only changed her name legally in the past year, since in our country it’s a long and difficult process to do so. But, as of now, Eevee has her chosen name on all legal documents and ID’s.

Now, onto the issue. Me and my family (Mom 48F, Dad 50M and sister 11F) were sitting and chatting when my sister asked if I knew what Eevee’s deadname was (note: my sister is on the spectrum and has a very hard time understanding social cues, and we have established that I’m a ‘safe person’ to ask any question, and if it’s offensive, I simply explain to her why that is so she can learn. It’s a system that works for us and I request no comments be made on that). I told her that I did (Eevee had me use her deadname around her parents before moving out since they weren’t exactly accepting) but I don’t tell anyone out of respect. 

My mom, who was sitting quiet and scrolling on her phone up until that point, just casually said “Oh, Eevee’s deadname? It’s [Deadname]”.

I immediately froze, and the next exchange went something along these lines:

Me: “Eevee hasn’t used that name in *years*, why would you say that? And how do you even know it?”

Mom: “I just searched around.”

Me: “Why would you search for that?!”

Mom: “For safety reasons. You go out with Eevee a lot, what if you went missing and the police asked who you were out with? I would say ‘Eevee’?”

(My mom has Eevee’s last name, her phone number, as well as full names of her parents, their phone numbers and addresses. My mom demanded that info or she wouldn’t let me hang out with Eevee)

Me: “Yes? Not to mention you have access to my location 24/7! Mom, why would you search for Eevee’s deadname? Don’t you see how disrespectful it is?”

Mom: “It’s public information! If she didn’t want her *real* name to be found, she should’ve been more mindful of what she posts online.”

Me: “Her *real* name is Eevee! Why would you do it, you always called her Eevee with no issue?”

Mom: “That’s because I didn’t know her *real* name. I’m the adult here, so I will be calling her by her *real* name, not some made up nickname.”

Me: “If you do that, I will never allow you around Eevee again.”

Mom: “You’re so dramatic. Did you take your meds today?”

(Another note: I have BPD, which does tend to make my emotions more intense. I’m both on meds and in therapy)

At this point I stormed out and went to my room (still living with my parents, moving out in September) to calm down. We didn’t talk for the rest of the day, and this morning my mom was hinting that I should apologize to her.

5,1dpf23g,AITA for telling my brother I think his soon to be ex-wife was right to leave him?,"My brother Adam (32M) and SIL Eve (29F) are in the middle of a divorce. Eve is the one who wants the divorce. Adam very much does not, but Eve is determined and has already moved out. I (30F) can’t blame her, because I would have done the same.

The background is that my brother has ADHD and has never been very good at complying with treatment to help with it.  He’s one of those people that has an amazing bouncy personality to be friends with, but living with him is a complete nightmare.  I know, because growing up I was always expected to pick up his slack. He doesn’t like to take meds because he doesn’t like the way they feel and therapy has never seemed to help him much. He and Eve met in college and he was living with our parents up until they got married, so I don’t think she realized just how bad it was until then.  Eve is one of the most chill people I know, but I’ve watched her go from happy and put together to a nervous wreck over their marriage.  We’re friends and talk a lot and she confided in me that she feels like the only adult in the house and it’s driving her slowly insane more than once. They tried marriage counseling but no lasting change. Eve has been in therapy for herself for the last year, but my brother doesn’t see the point.

The straw that broke the camels back was her having surgery and my brother completely dropping the ball on helping her while she recovered as she couldn’t get around easily. Her mother ended up having to fly there to take care of her. She told him that she couldn’t do it anymore and she wanted to have kids, but could never trust him to be a good parent now, so they needed to split. Ever since she moved out, his life has been complete chaos because she really was the only one doing any of the household management.

I’ve been holding my tongue and trying to be supportive while he cries and complains because I know it’s hard. But I was on the phone with him the other day and he called Eve a bitch for leaving him and making it about kids when she knows how much he wants them. I just had it. I told him that Eve leaving him was the best move for her own mental health and she was probably right that he’s not responsible enough to be a father right now and may never be at this rate. He needs to take a good look at his life without Eve and ask himself if he’s capable of doing the hard everyday parts of parenting or if he just wanted the fun parts while Eve did all the actual work?

He’s furious with me and our mom chewed me out for kicking him while he’s down. Our dad agrees with me (and we have secretly made a pact that we’re keeping Eve in the divorce) but thinks I shouldn’t have kicked the anthill.

8,1dpexct,AITA for not letting men use my bathroom?,"I (37F) live with my husband (40M), and our sons (17M), (16M), and (14M). I never had my own bathroom growing up, so when we bought a house, my husband told me I could have my own bathroom if wanted. I only let our female guests use my bathroom. I do not like having men in my bathroom whatsoever. I’ve told my sons before that they can pee in the backyard before going to my bathroom. My bathroom is the only bathroom downstairs, so my husband and one son walk upstairs to use the bathroom. My husband and sons think I’m ridiculous, but I don’t care.

We were having a party at my house. My sons and my husband invited their friends, so I decided to invite a couple friends. My friends and I were talking upstairs, then one of my friends, who is also the mom of one of my son’s friend said she was going to use the bathroom. I told her to go use my bathroom, and said “Isn’t there a bathroom right there” as she was referring to my husbands bathroom, but I told her to just use my bathroom, and it’s better to not use my husbands bathroom. She walked off downstairs to my bathroom. 

A minute later, my friend came back, and she said she’d wait because, there was somebody already in the bathroom, and there was a line. I marched downstairs, and it was men and teenage boys in line for my bathroom. I came over to my husband and sons and started screaming at them for not telling their friends about my rule. I told the guests to never use my bathroom ever again very sternly. My husbands friends all started laughing at me and talking about me in Spanish (they’re Mexican). My son’s friends were also laughing at me. I then started yelling at all of them, because they need to know I’m serious. My friends at this time came down to see what was happening. I told everyone how it was disgusting to have men pee in my bathroom, it’s unsanitary, and it makes me nauseous.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-27,"AITA for not letting men use my bathroom? I (37F) live with my husband (40M), and our sons (17M), (16M), and (14M). I never had my own bathroom growing up, so when we bought a house, my husband told me I could have my own bathroom if wanted. I only let our female guests use my bathroom. I do not like having men in my bathroom whatsoever. I’ve told my sons before that they can pee in the backyard before going to my bathroom. My bathroom is the only bathroom downstairs, so my husband and one son walk upstairs to use the bathroom. My husband and sons think I’m ridiculous, but I don’t care.

We were having a party at my house. My sons and my husband invited their friends, so I decided to invite a couple friends. My friends and I were talking upstairs, then one of my friends, who is also the mom of one of my son’s friend said she was going to use the bathroom. I told her to go use my bathroom, and said “Isn’t there a bathroom right there” as she was referring to my husbands bathroom, but I told her to just use my bathroom, and it’s better to not use my husbands bathroom. She walked off downstairs to my bathroom. 

A minute later, my friend came back, and she said she’d wait because, there was somebody already in the bathroom, and there was a line. I marched downstairs, and it was men and teenage boys in line for my bathroom. I came over to my husband and sons and started screaming at them for not telling their friends about my rule. I told the guests to never use my bathroom ever again very sternly. My husbands friends all started laughing at me and talking about me in Spanish (they’re Mexican). My son’s friends were also laughing at me. I then started yelling at all of them, because they need to know I’m serious. My friends at this time came down to see what was happening. I told everyone how it was disgusting to have men pee in my bathroom, it’s unsanitary, and it makes me nauseous.

9,1dpev8j,AITA For being mad about my sister asking for a gym refund she paid for me,"My sister (25F) came to me (21F) before the summer to ask if I was interested in going to the gym together and that she will pay for both of us. I said that's awesome sure so she bought a 3month subscription. (150euro each). 

I went 2-3 a week, together. She went more days so averaged around 3-4. Last two weeks I didn't go. Why? I have a fucked up period cycle that lasts months at a time so I am constantly on birth control. Some days it's not there, other days it is. I'm used to it, and the doctors say it's not something to worry about. But I hate working out on days where it's heavier. I also am prone to low iron meaning I feel exhausted easier. So I just didn't go for the last two weeks. 

I haven't given up on getting healthier, I am still cutting and counting calories. And I do plan to make the most of this subscription.

Today she came over to me and said since you haven't been going to the gym recently I want my 150 euro back. I thought she was joking bcs the 3 months is not over, it's only been one month. She wasn't joking though and I got upset. And just realised if she's asking for a refund, damage is already done so I just agreed.

It upset me for two reasons. She lives with us and knows how my cycle affects me and how I don't have alot of energy to do alot most days. She has seen me laying in bed 3/the last two weeks bcs of cramp attacks and exhaustion. The other reason was she bought it already, she offered to pay. I was never gonna bring up the gym I wasn't planning on doing it over the summer but she offered and I agreed, so I felt like even if I didn't go every week, asking for a refund was controlling and pressuring me to the gym. 

So I agreed to pay her refund back and Im planning to never go at the same she's going.

10,1dperhu,AITA for telling my girlfriend she is always so emotional? ,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (23F) for 3 years. Our relationship has been rocky lately.

The other day, she was violently pmsing. She has PMDD and becomes quite unstable before her period. She’s angry, crying, super short with me, super self loathing, etc… I feel for her, truly. 

We were out on a date at this nice bar and things were going super well until she logged onto social media and saw that her friend was out with a different friend, without her. She got so upset and immediately started tearing up and the mood shifted. She went to the bathroom and when she came back I could tell she was crying in the bathroom. She talked out her feelings, but I could tell she was holding back tears the entire time. 

When we left, we got into my car and she immediately burst into tears just sobbing and saying that her friend hates her and everyone hates her/never wants to do anything with her and she feels like she gets the short end of the stick. She cried the entire drive home. I could tell she was trying to stop crying, but she just couldn’t.

I told her she’s always so emotional and should address this the next day when she’s feeling more stable. She lost it and went off saying that I’m an asshole and never understand her feelings and I think everything is black and white and that I can’t see her pov on anything. I was just trying to get her to stop crying.

Well we got home and she gave me the silent treatment and when we woke up the next morning she apologized for “being crazy” and explained that she’s pmsing. I’m sick of her pms being an excuse for her to have a huge mental breakdown every month. This happens monthly. I don’t know how to comfort her. So, AITA?

11,1dpeqhi,AITA for choosing to call CPS on my hoarder mom,"I have never posted here and I’m not sure anyone will see it, anyways. But I figured it’s worth a shot. 

My mom, 40, is a hoarder. 
I’d like to say it started around the time her and her babydad broke up. She had my sister 6 years ago, and shortly after, he moved out. He has no rights to her, therefore my mom has her 24/7. This is my issue. If my mother wanted to be a hoarder and live in it herself, fine, that’s your deal. I do not want my sister growing up in this environment that is continually getting worse. 
Not only is she a hoarder, she is a shopaholic. (Those tend to go hand in hand). Almost every time I come to her house there are packages waiting at the door. 
She owns a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house, with a 2 car garage and a shed in the backyard. Every single room is full. Her own bedroom, is full. There are walkways, but sometimes even those have stuff in the way. 
I’m currently sitting in one of her bathrooms writing this, and I am looking at 6 things of hand soap and 11 loofahs. Just to give you an idea. 
My sister and I have both brought this topic up to her numerous times, she is well aware that she has a problem, yet does nothing about it. She will complain about how overwhelmed she is in her home, yet any offer for help is turned down, or some excuse is made. 
I offered to rent a uhaul and fill it up and take it to donation. I have offered to post things on facebook marketplace for her because she is convinced everything is worth money. 
I even had a garage sale for her in the middle of summer, worked my ass off and surprise! no one bought anything. We probably made $20 after being out there all day. 
When I offered the uhaul, she came up with the excuse that things are sentimental to her and that she would need to go through EVERYTHING before getting rid of stuff. 
I worry about the effects this will have on my sister. It has affected me, and I do not even live with her anymore. 
When I say she is a hoarder, I do not mean trash and bugs and nasty stuff like that. It is just STUFF. 
Sometimes I think about her passing away in the future and how long it will take for my siblings and I to go through everything in this house. 
I have considered calling CPS because of it, however she used to work for them and told me that they will not do ANYTHING unless the child is in danger. Which she is not. She is taken care of, but this place is so anxiety inducing. I hate coming over here. 
I feel like I am stuck. There is nothing I can do, but i desperately want to do something for the sake of both of them.

Then I scooped up the cat and headed down to our unfinished, fairly shitty basement. No one in their right minds would want to hang out down there. I heard Jade walking around upstairs but she never came down. I kept my cat calm while we waited it out and the warning was canceled.

16,1dpdm23,AITA for asking my rental company to communicate with both tentants?,"For some context: My boyfriend (22) and I (23) decided to move in together. We moved into an apartment complex by Fake Name Rentals on June 1st. Very quickly we realized that they had knowingly rented us an apartment that was infested with roaches. We didn't really have any other options at the time within budget, so we got them to transfer our lease to a different building. Before you ask, yes, we documented everything possible every single step of the way. We moved into the new unit, after thoroughly disposing of everything we didn't need and triple checking everything else for roaches or egg sacs. 

During the 2nd moving process, my boyfriend lost track of the keys. He contacted the rental office to ask for the locks to be changed and to let us know as soon as that would be possible (fear of someone finding the lost keys and getting in). Yesterday while we were both at work, a random guy from the rental office showed up at our places of work to hand us our ""new keys"". We were not contacted in any way to let us know that they would be showing up with new keys for our front door lock that they had apparently just replaced without letting us know they were doing so that day. I was freaked out because some strange man I never met showed up with the key to my house at my damn workplace without any warning. My boyfriend was also not contacted in any way past him requesting an estimated timeframe for lock replacement. These are the text exchanges between my rental company and I after this happened.

I feel I may be TA because of the defensive tone they used when they responded to me and I feel it may have been a genuine misunderstanding, but I'm still really upset by it because it caused so much unnecessary stress and neither of us knew what was going on until the guy stopped by our workplaces with our keys. My boyfriend only had about 30 minutes warning to text me about what happened, and I didn't even read the message because I was at work. I just got called to the office, only to be greeted by this strange man that had the key to my front door for a reason I didn't even know about yet. Also, I know whoever changed our lock did more than ""crack the door"", because there are several screws that needed to be screwed in from the inside.

We both signed the exact same contracts for our lease and we are both equal tenants and separate people, so I thought we were both entitled to the same treatment (aka same communications) as separate entities on the lease.

AITA for my following texts to the rental company?

For some context: My boyfriend (22) and I (23) decided to move in together. We moved into an apartment complex by Fake Name Rentals on June 1st. Very quickly we realized that they had knowingly rented us an apartment that was infested with roaches. We didn't really have any other options at the time within budget, so we got them to transfer our lease to a different building. Before you ask, yes, we documented everything possible every single step of the way. We moved into the new unit, after thoroughly disposing of everything we didn't need and triple checking everything else for roaches or egg sacs. 

During the 2nd moving process, my boyfriend lost track of the keys. He contacted the rental office to ask for the locks to be changed and to let us know as soon as that would be possible (fear of someone finding the lost keys and getting in). Yesterday while we were both at work, a random guy from the rental office showed up at our places of work to hand us our ""new keys"". We were not contacted in any way to let us know that they would be showing up with new keys for our front door lock that they had apparently just replaced without letting us know they were doing so that day. I was freaked out because some strange man I never met showed up with the key to my house at my damn workplace without any warning. My boyfriend was also not contacted in any way past him requesting an estimated timeframe for lock replacement. These are the text exchanges between my rental company and I after this happened.

I woke up at 7 to get ready to leave, to a text from 6:45 of her telling me “so much for early I fed the cat.” I texted back “it’s literally 7, but okay thank you.” now normally I do not feed her until like 8:30/9 and I did get back around 8:20/8:30. She texted back saying the cat was in her room bothering her since 5:30 so when I got back I let her know I would bring the cat into my room so she wouldn’t bother her.

for background: even when this guy sleeps over at my place, there still always seems to be problems with the cat, however any other night when it’s just the two of us, there never seems to be any issues with the cat and they just appear when I have plans.
