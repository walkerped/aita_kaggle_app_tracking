1,1dpts8i,WIBTA for refusing to buy a late birthday gift for my son's classmate? (UPDATE),"The main piece of advice I got when I first posted here (or at least the one that stuck with me the most) was to buy a smaller, inexpensive gift for James. I was more than fine with doing that, but I had no idea what he liked. I also didn't want to give him that gift during his brother's birthday party, as that didn't feel fair to Mikey.

My wife and I talked, and we settled on getting James a gift card to a bookstore. We also had our older son give it to him at school, days before the party. He said James was grateful.

Later that day, the boys' mom texted the mom groupchat saying she didn't want people ""cheaping out"" on James just because it wasn't his birthday. My wife agrees that it felt targeted, but we can't prove anything. Either way, we've given him a gift. We don't need to indulge in this any more than we already have. We'll just complain to each other.

Our younger son wasn't uninvited from the birthday party. I was working, so my wife took him. According to her, the party was clearly Mikey's. The only thing indicating otherwise was the fact that James opened his gifts during it. 

My wife said she avoided their parents, but did get a few dirty looks from them, specially when Mikey opened the gift my son had picked out. It was a Spider Man toy car that he thought Mikey would like. We'd bought it before this whole fiasco. Since we actually know Mikey, it was more personal than the gift card.

I still don't understand a single decision the boys' parents made, but I'm glad my son's friendship is intact. I just hope my wife and I don't need to interact with that family too much in the future.

2,1dpnskd,AITA for blowing up at my mom for purposefully searching up my bsf’s deadname?,"English is not my first language, I’m writing this on mobile, not in the US, all that jazz, so please excuse any grammar or spelling errors.

I (19NB) have a best friend of 5 years (20MtF, we’ll call her Eevee), who is trans. Eevee hasn’t used her deadname in years, but only changed her name legally in the past year, since in our country it’s a long and difficult process to do so. But, as of now, Eevee has her chosen name on all legal documents and ID’s.

Now, onto the issue. Me and my family (Mom 48F, Dad 50M and sister 11F) were sitting and chatting when my sister asked if I knew what Eevee’s deadname was (note: my sister is on the spectrum and has a very hard time understanding social cues, and we have established that I’m a ‘safe person’ to ask any question, and if it’s offensive, I simply explain to her why that is so she can learn. It’s a system that works for us and I request no comments be made on that). I told her that I did (Eevee had me use her deadname around her parents before moving out since they weren’t exactly accepting) but I don’t tell anyone out of respect. 

My mom, who was sitting quiet and scrolling on her phone up until that point, just casually said “Oh, Eevee’s deadname? It’s [Deadname]”.

I immediately froze, and the next exchange went something along these lines:

Me: “Eevee hasn’t used that name in *years*, why would you say that? And how do you even know it?”

Mom: “I just searched around.”

Me: “Why would you search for that?!”

Mom: “For safety reasons. You go out with Eevee a lot, what if you went missing and the police asked who you were out with? I would say ‘Eevee’?”

(My mom has Eevee’s last name, her phone number, as well as full names of her parents, their phone numbers and addresses. My mom demanded that info or she wouldn’t let me hang out with Eevee)

Me: “Yes? Not to mention you have access to my location 24/7! Mom, why would you search for Eevee’s deadname? Don’t you see how disrespectful it is?”

Mom: “It’s public information! If she didn’t want her *real* name to be found, she should’ve been more mindful of what she posts online.”

Me: “Her *real* name is Eevee! Why would you do it, you always called her Eevee with no issue?”

Mom: “That’s because I didn’t know her *real* name. I’m the adult here, so I will be calling her by her *real* name, not some made up nickname.”

Me: “If you do that, I will never allow you around Eevee again.”

Mom: “You’re so dramatic. Did you take your meds today?”

(Another note: I have BPD, which does tend to make my emotions more intense. I’m both on meds and in therapy)

At this point I stormed out and went to my room (still living with my parents, moving out in September) to calm down. We didn’t talk for the rest of the day, and this morning my mom was hinting that I should apologize to her.

5,1dpf23g,AITA for telling my brother I think his soon to be ex-wife was right to leave him?,"My brother Adam (32M) and SIL Eve (29F) are in the middle of a divorce. Eve is the one who wants the divorce. Adam very much does not, but Eve is determined and has already moved out. I (30F) can’t blame her, because I would have done the same.

The background is that my brother has ADHD and has never been very good at complying with treatment to help with it.  He’s one of those people that has an amazing bouncy personality to be friends with, but living with him is a complete nightmare.  I know, because growing up I was always expected to pick up his slack. He doesn’t like to take meds because he doesn’t like the way they feel and therapy has never seemed to help him much. He and Eve met in college and he was living with our parents up until they got married, so I don’t think she realized just how bad it was until then.  Eve is one of the most chill people I know, but I’ve watched her go from happy and put together to a nervous wreck over their marriage.  We’re friends and talk a lot and she confided in me that she feels like the only adult in the house and it’s driving her slowly insane more than once. They tried marriage counseling but no lasting change. Eve has been in therapy for herself for the last year, but my brother doesn’t see the point.

The straw that broke the camels back was her having surgery and my brother completely dropping the ball on helping her while she recovered as she couldn’t get around easily. Her mother ended up having to fly there to take care of her. She told him that she couldn’t do it anymore and she wanted to have kids, but could never trust him to be a good parent now, so they needed to split. Ever since she moved out, his life has been complete chaos because she really was the only one doing any of the household management.

I’ve been holding my tongue and trying to be supportive while he cries and complains because I know it’s hard. But I was on the phone with him the other day and he called Eve a bitch for leaving him and making it about kids when she knows how much he wants them. I just had it. I told him that Eve leaving him was the best move for her own mental health and she was probably right that he’s not responsible enough to be a father right now and may never be at this rate. He needs to take a good look at his life without Eve and ask himself if he’s capable of doing the hard everyday parts of parenting or if he just wanted the fun parts while Eve did all the actual work?

He’s furious with me and our mom chewed me out for kicking him while he’s down. Our dad agrees with me (and we have secretly made a pact that we’re keeping Eve in the divorce) but thinks I shouldn’t have kicked the anthill.

8,1dpexct,AITA for not letting men use my bathroom?,"I (37F) live with my husband (40M), and our sons (17M), (16M), and (14M). I never had my own bathroom growing up, so when we bought a house, my husband told me I could have my own bathroom if wanted. I only let our female guests use my bathroom. I do not like having men in my bathroom whatsoever. I’ve told my sons before that they can pee in the backyard before going to my bathroom. My bathroom is the only bathroom downstairs, so my husband and one son walk upstairs to use the bathroom. My husband and sons think I’m ridiculous, but I don’t care.

We were having a party at my house. My sons and my husband invited their friends, so I decided to invite a couple friends. My friends and I were talking upstairs, then one of my friends, who is also the mom of one of my son’s friend said she was going to use the bathroom. I told her to go use my bathroom, and said “Isn’t there a bathroom right there” as she was referring to my husbands bathroom, but I told her to just use my bathroom, and it’s better to not use my husbands bathroom. She walked off downstairs to my bathroom. 

A minute later, my friend came back, and she said she’d wait because, there was somebody already in the bathroom, and there was a line. I marched downstairs, and it was men and teenage boys in line for my bathroom. I came over to my husband and sons and started screaming at them for not telling their friends about my rule. I told the guests to never use my bathroom ever again very sternly. My husbands friends all started laughing at me and talking about me in Spanish (they’re Mexican). My son’s friends were also laughing at me. I then started yelling at all of them, because they need to know I’m serious. My friends at this time came down to see what was happening. I told everyone how it was disgusting to have men pee in my bathroom, it’s unsanitary, and it makes me nauseous.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-06-27,"AITA for not letting men use my bathroom? I (37F) live with my husband (40M), and our sons (17M), (16M), and (14M). I never had my own bathroom growing up, so when we bought a house, my husband told me I could have my own bathroom if wanted. I only let our female guests use my bathroom. I do not like having men in my bathroom whatsoever. I’ve told my sons before that they can pee in the backyard before going to my bathroom. My bathroom is the only bathroom downstairs, so my husband and one son walk upstairs to use the bathroom. My husband and sons think I’m ridiculous, but I don’t care.

We were having a party at my house. My sons and my husband invited their friends, so I decided to invite a couple friends. My friends and I were talking upstairs, then one of my friends, who is also the mom of one of my son’s friend said she was going to use the bathroom. I told her to go use my bathroom, and said “Isn’t there a bathroom right there” as she was referring to my husbands bathroom, but I told her to just use my bathroom, and it’s better to not use my husbands bathroom. She walked off downstairs to my bathroom. 

A minute later, my friend came back, and she said she’d wait because, there was somebody already in the bathroom, and there was a line. I marched downstairs, and it was men and teenage boys in line for my bathroom. I came over to my husband and sons and started screaming at them for not telling their friends about my rule. I told the guests to never use my bathroom ever again very sternly. My husbands friends all started laughing at me and talking about me in Spanish (they’re Mexican). My son’s friends were also laughing at me. I then started yelling at all of them, because they need to know I’m serious. My friends at this time came down to see what was happening. I told everyone how it was disgusting to have men pee in my bathroom, it’s unsanitary, and it makes me nauseous.

9,1dpev8j,AITA For being mad about my sister asking for a gym refund she paid for me,"My sister (25F) came to me (21F) before the summer to ask if I was interested in going to the gym together and that she will pay for both of us. I said that's awesome sure so she bought a 3month subscription. (150euro each). 

I went 2-3 a week, together. She went more days so averaged around 3-4. Last two weeks I didn't go. Why? I have a fucked up period cycle that lasts months at a time so I am constantly on birth control. Some days it's not there, other days it is. I'm used to it, and the doctors say it's not something to worry about. But I hate working out on days where it's heavier. I also am prone to low iron meaning I feel exhausted easier. So I just didn't go for the last two weeks. 

I haven't given up on getting healthier, I am still cutting and counting calories. And I do plan to make the most of this subscription.

Today she came over to me and said since you haven't been going to the gym recently I want my 150 euro back. I thought she was joking bcs the 3 months is not over, it's only been one month. She wasn't joking though and I got upset. And just realised if she's asking for a refund, damage is already done so I just agreed.

It upset me for two reasons. She lives with us and knows how my cycle affects me and how I don't have alot of energy to do alot most days. She has seen me laying in bed 3/the last two weeks bcs of cramp attacks and exhaustion. The other reason was she bought it already, she offered to pay. I was never gonna bring up the gym I wasn't planning on doing it over the summer but she offered and I agreed, so I felt like even if I didn't go every week, asking for a refund was controlling and pressuring me to the gym. 

So I agreed to pay her refund back and Im planning to never go at the same she's going.

10,1dperhu,AITA for telling my girlfriend she is always so emotional? ,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (23F) for 3 years. Our relationship has been rocky lately.

The other day, she was violently pmsing. She has PMDD and becomes quite unstable before her period. She’s angry, crying, super short with me, super self loathing, etc… I feel for her, truly. 

We were out on a date at this nice bar and things were going super well until she logged onto social media and saw that her friend was out with a different friend, without her. She got so upset and immediately started tearing up and the mood shifted. She went to the bathroom and when she came back I could tell she was crying in the bathroom. She talked out her feelings, but I could tell she was holding back tears the entire time. 

When we left, we got into my car and she immediately burst into tears just sobbing and saying that her friend hates her and everyone hates her/never wants to do anything with her and she feels like she gets the short end of the stick. She cried the entire drive home. I could tell she was trying to stop crying, but she just couldn’t.

I told her she’s always so emotional and should address this the next day when she’s feeling more stable. She lost it and went off saying that I’m an asshole and never understand her feelings and I think everything is black and white and that I can’t see her pov on anything. I was just trying to get her to stop crying.

Well we got home and she gave me the silent treatment and when we woke up the next morning she apologized for “being crazy” and explained that she’s pmsing. I’m sick of her pms being an excuse for her to have a huge mental breakdown every month. This happens monthly. I don’t know how to comfort her. So, AITA?

11,1dpeqhi,AITA for choosing to call CPS on my hoarder mom,"I have never posted here and I’m not sure anyone will see it, anyways. But I figured it’s worth a shot. 

My mom, 40, is a hoarder. 
I’d like to say it started around the time her and her babydad broke up. She had my sister 6 years ago, and shortly after, he moved out. He has no rights to her, therefore my mom has her 24/7. This is my issue. If my mother wanted to be a hoarder and live in it herself, fine, that’s your deal. I do not want my sister growing up in this environment that is continually getting worse. 
Not only is she a hoarder, she is a shopaholic. (Those tend to go hand in hand). Almost every time I come to her house there are packages waiting at the door. 
She owns a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house, with a 2 car garage and a shed in the backyard. Every single room is full. Her own bedroom, is full. There are walkways, but sometimes even those have stuff in the way. 
I’m currently sitting in one of her bathrooms writing this, and I am looking at 6 things of hand soap and 11 loofahs. Just to give you an idea. 
My sister and I have both brought this topic up to her numerous times, she is well aware that she has a problem, yet does nothing about it. She will complain about how overwhelmed she is in her home, yet any offer for help is turned down, or some excuse is made. 
I offered to rent a uhaul and fill it up and take it to donation. I have offered to post things on facebook marketplace for her because she is convinced everything is worth money. 
I even had a garage sale for her in the middle of summer, worked my ass off and surprise! no one bought anything. We probably made $20 after being out there all day. 
When I offered the uhaul, she came up with the excuse that things are sentimental to her and that she would need to go through EVERYTHING before getting rid of stuff. 
I worry about the effects this will have on my sister. It has affected me, and I do not even live with her anymore. 
When I say she is a hoarder, I do not mean trash and bugs and nasty stuff like that. It is just STUFF. 
Sometimes I think about her passing away in the future and how long it will take for my siblings and I to go through everything in this house. 
I have considered calling CPS because of it, however she used to work for them and told me that they will not do ANYTHING unless the child is in danger. Which she is not. She is taken care of, but this place is so anxiety inducing. I hate coming over here. 
I feel like I am stuck. There is nothing I can do, but i desperately want to do something for the sake of both of them.

Then I scooped up the cat and headed down to our unfinished, fairly shitty basement. No one in their right minds would want to hang out down there. I heard Jade walking around upstairs but she never came down. I kept my cat calm while we waited it out and the warning was canceled.

16,1dpdm23,AITA for asking my rental company to communicate with both tentants?,"For some context: My boyfriend (22) and I (23) decided to move in together. We moved into an apartment complex by Fake Name Rentals on June 1st. Very quickly we realized that they had knowingly rented us an apartment that was infested with roaches. We didn't really have any other options at the time within budget, so we got them to transfer our lease to a different building. Before you ask, yes, we documented everything possible every single step of the way. We moved into the new unit, after thoroughly disposing of everything we didn't need and triple checking everything else for roaches or egg sacs. 

During the 2nd moving process, my boyfriend lost track of the keys. He contacted the rental office to ask for the locks to be changed and to let us know as soon as that would be possible (fear of someone finding the lost keys and getting in). Yesterday while we were both at work, a random guy from the rental office showed up at our places of work to hand us our ""new keys"". We were not contacted in any way to let us know that they would be showing up with new keys for our front door lock that they had apparently just replaced without letting us know they were doing so that day. I was freaked out because some strange man I never met showed up with the key to my house at my damn workplace without any warning. My boyfriend was also not contacted in any way past him requesting an estimated timeframe for lock replacement. These are the text exchanges between my rental company and I after this happened.

My boyfriend only had about 30 minutes warning to text me about what happened, and I didn't even read the message because I was at work. I just got called to the office, only to be greeted by this strange man that had the key to my front door for a reason I didn't even know about yet. Also, I know whoever changed our lock did more than ""crack the door"", because there are several screws that needed to be screwed in from the inside.

We both signed the exact same contracts for our lease and we are both equal tenants and separate people, so I thought we were both entitled to the same treatment (aka same communications) as separate entities on the lease.

For some context: My boyfriend (22) and I (23) decided to move in together. We moved into an apartment complex by Fake Name Rentals on June 1st. Very quickly we realized that they had knowingly rented us an apartment that was infested with roaches. We didn't really have any other options at the time within budget, so we got them to transfer our lease to a different building. Before you ask, yes, we documented everything possible every single step of the way. We moved into the new unit, after thoroughly disposing of everything we didn't need and triple checking everything else for roaches or egg sacs. 

During the 2nd moving process, my boyfriend lost track of the keys. He contacted the rental office to ask for the locks to be changed and to let us know as soon as that would be possible (fear of someone finding the lost keys and getting in). Yesterday while we were both at work, a random guy from the rental office showed up at our places of work to hand us our ""new keys"". We were not contacted in any way to let us know that they would be showing up with new keys for our front door lock that they had apparently just replaced without letting us know they were doing so that day. I was freaked out because some strange man I never met showed up with the key to my house at my damn workplace without any warning. My boyfriend was also not contacted in any way past him requesting an estimated timeframe for lock replacement. These are the text exchanges between my rental company and I after this happened.

My husband gets so upset when I do this because he says the only reason he is rewatching this show/ movie is so that he can watch my reactions to certain things in it and when I look things up I have no reaction at all because I know it's coming.

  
It got particularly heated last night when we started watching this show called the last of us.  It has quite a few tense moments and early on I started to look things up. He saw me doing this and after some back and forth he said he won't be recommending anything else for us to watch if I'm just going to spoil what happens.

20,1dq5xfh,AITA for not for not going to my moms wedding ,"AITA For not wanting to go my moms wedding?

Hey so I (21m) am trying to get perspective. My mom (43F) is getting married to her first boyfriend. The issue is, is that he doesn’t get along with any of my moms family and myself included. I tried giving him a chance in the beginning when they were still talking (he was in her home country) when I saw still in high school. I just never really clicked with him, and he started to rub me the wrong way after i noticed some of his bossier personality traits and she started sending him money and lying about it. It got to the point where me and my sister would go hungry at times. She would adamantly deny sending him money but in reality she was, and he managed to open up his own business with all the money she sent. I could go on and on about all this, but suffice it to say that I don’t approve or like this relationship.

Btw he slide into her DMs when he was still married to his then wife, with a 3 month old and a young teen at home  

Another factor into all this is that I’m also queer, which she doesn’t approve of. Once she clung to my feet and cried and begged me to changed and to forgive her. This along with other things lead to a really nasty fight. she basically found some intimate pics on my phone and used it to humiliate me in front of my bio dad. She tried to forced the phone in his face to make him look but he just kept telling her to stop. (This happened when I was 17.) Even he thought she had crossed a line but she doesn’t see it that way. This among with some other things she did made me snap and I had a meltdown but my dad calmed us both down and tried to remediate the situation to a little avail. 

Anyways this all brings me to the tittle of this post. She’s getting married this Sunday but I told her that I have no intention of going to her wedding. She got really sad and said ok but that was a couple of weeks ago. Since then she’s been trying to get me to go and tried to get my bio dad to talk to me and my sister. A couple of days ago she confronted me and basically tried to guilt trip me into going by saying “oh it would just make my day to have my children next to my side.” Then she touched my chest and when I asked her what she was doing she said “just feeling to see if you actually have a heart”.she also said that I at least had to go to the reception and I had to be home before they got back because it was already bad enough her son wasn’t going to be at the wedding. Today was the wedding rehearsal and she asked me if i really wasn’t going. When I said no her whole attitude changed and she got all depressed. So AITA for not going?

21,1dq5q8t,AITA For not accepting help when I didn’t ask for it?," Today was a pretty rough day. I woke up in a blah mood and decided I was just going to stay home and get some vitamin d instead of running errands. I had taken the day off to piggyback on my vacation that starts tomorrow. I was hanging around, when my husband asked what I wanted for dinner. I didn’t feel like cooking and was just going to have a salad and leftover grilled chicken. My husband sheepishly admitted that he had eaten the leftover chicken but that he would go to the supermarket, buy some more and grill me a fresh piece. This man is an angel and is always thinking of others, so I can not be mad at all. He does so much for our family and if he wants the leftover chicken, he can have it. 
  I told him I needed to grab a couple things anyway and that I would go. So off to the store I went. I quickly realized, that one of the errands I had blown off today, was grocery shopping. I grabbed a smaller cart and set off to shop. I ended up with a cart full of stuff and a couple cases of water. I finished shopping, paid and headed out to my car to load it up and head home. 
   This is where I might be the AH. as I was loading my car, a woman with two kids comes up to me and tells me she can take my cart. The cart still has bags of groceries and the cases of water on it. I told her thank you, but I was still unloading the cart and I’ll put it back, but that I appreciated the offer. 
   This lady starts unloading my cart for me. Putting my bags on the ground and directs her son to remove the cases of water from the bottom of the cart. I snapped at her and told her I didn’t need help and to not put my things on the ground. She had one of my bags in her hand, dropped it and said she was just trying to help and I didn’t need to snap at her. I told her I didn’t ask for or need help. She rolled her eyes at me and muttered “fucking bitch” and walked away. She walked a couple feet ahead and yelled back that I can put my own cart away then. I yelled back that I had intended to from the beginning.
  I was pretty bitchy I guess, I did have an attitude when I told her to back off, but I felt like she was in my personal space. I finished loading my car, and returned the cart to the store vestibule. Her and her kids were standing in the vestibule talking with someone from my neighborhood that my husband and I are friendly with. I gave my neighbor a wave and walked back to my car.

We are very excited, but we are still in the early stages where a miscarriage is still in play. Outside of us and the doctors, the only other people who know are her mom, my mom and one of her close recently pregnant friends (so she can talk through symptoms). Our initial plan was to tell our dad's once we get the green light from the doctor (usually around week 8) and then to tell my siblings a couple week after that and everyone else a couple weeks after that.

She wants to tell two of her friends who she talks to every day because it's too hard to keep it secret from them. They ask her how she is every day and she has to continually lie to them and say she's fine.

She talked to me about it but I don't really want her to because I don't feel good about both of our dad's plus my siblings not knowing but 2 of her friends knowing (she doesn't have siblings FYI). It turned into a whole argument that it's not my choice anyways, ""my body, my choice."" So I just want to know from people, am I the asshole for not wanting her to tell her friends before we tell my siblings and our dads?

**Edit**

Thank you for everyone who responded. Definitely a few mixed opinions on this issue, but I am going to disable inbox replies because I think I got what I was looking for. I'm going to just apologize to my wife and make sure she knows I support her in telling her friends to help find the support she needs. 

Only other thing I wanted to address based off the comments is that she was the one who initially didn't want to tell people because she was anxious about having a miscarriage and having to come back to all those people if it did happen. The whole not telling anyone because of that was never my idea.

So I just want to know from people, am I the asshole for not wanting her to tell her friends before we tell my siblings and our dads?

**Edit**

Thank you for everyone who responded. Definitely a few mixed opinions on this issue, but I am going to disable inbox replies because I think I got what I was looking for. I'm going to just apologize to my wife and make sure she knows I support her in telling her friends to help find the support she needs. 

Only other thing I wanted to address based off the comments is that she was the one who initially didn't want to tell people because she was anxious about having a miscarriage and having to come back to all those people if it did happen. The whole not telling anyone because of that was never my idea.

Anyways, have a good day y'all!",1.0,1.0648530721664429,1,1
24,1dq5jg5,AITA for refusing to cook my brother a grilled cheese and telling my mom?,"I (15f) have always had a love for cooking. It’s not something I’m exceptionally good at or would choose as a career, but I do enjoy doing it. My brother (11m), however, does not. He hates cooking and only knows how to heat up a cup of Mac and cheese or ramen. Only a few months ago did he learn to heat up leftovers. I find it bad that he’s this incompetent in the kitchen, but my mother doesn’t seem to care as she cooks most nights. She’s been a single mom with both of us since 2018, and with me being 4 years older than my brother, I’m closer to her than he is since I will also sit in the kitchen while she cooks or help her.

Tonight she went out with our aunt to a bingo game so my brother and I were left to our own devices for dinner. I decided to heat up some mashed potatoes we had left over and ate them out of the black microwave steamer cup I heated it up in. My brother saw me finish eating and complained about me using it because he was going to eat mashed potatoes. I reminded him we have plenty of microwaveable safe bowls he can use and also offered to wash it for him if it really meant that much to him.

He retaliated by saying “since you ate out of that, you can make me a grilled cheese”, and I said no, because that does not relate at all. I told him he could do it himself, and when he said he doesn’t know how, I told him he could find a YouTube tutorial or I could write the instructions down for him. He got mad and stormed off, saying he won’t eat anything at all then.

I called our mother and told her, to which she asked if I could just make him a grilled cheese. I told her he needs to learn how to do it himself because his incompetence in the kitchen is concerning. She said maybe I could help him, but it was either I did the work alone or he didn’t eat. When I told her that, she said that I could either make him one or wait until she gets home. I said okay and we hung up.

I don’t think I’m the asshole but I’m not really sure.

Edit: For all those asking about why my mom didn’t prepare a meal, it’s because she gave us options, like mad and cheese, left overs, non-grilled sandwiches, etc. yet he chose something that was never an option because he was mad–or so I assume. But she wasn’t aware that he would choose that. She came home half an hour ago and he got his grilled cheese, everyone is chilled now.

Also, for the record, I’m not saying he should be able to cook super well at 11, I’m saying demanding I make him a grilled cheese in the spot is spoiled and that I’m not his maid.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-27,"AITA for refusing to cook my brother a grilled cheese and telling my mom?

It's been a huge struggle raising him, especially since he has completely different interests to me which is completely fine, but makes things difficult.  Someone who has been a great figure in his life is my sister/his aunt May, as she is really into the same interests as Mark and they have a great time whenever she babysits.

A few years ago I met my girlfriend Laura 37F, who was a single mum since Luke's dad was never in the picture.  Me and Luke actually really hit it off since Laura introduced me to him.  He never really had any male role models, since Laura only had sisters, and her dad died when she was a teenager.

I've tried a couple of times to take Mark to football matches, but he just doesn't have any interest in it, so May looked after Mark when I'd go to football games a couple of times a year.  However Luke was incredibly excited to go to games with me, as he's never been before but is a big fan.

Even though he doesn't go to football with me, I still make sure to take him to things that he'd enjoy such as West End shows, and concerts of his favourite singers.

I said to May that although I understand and try to speak to Mark, it would be incredibly unfair to Luke to stop taking him out and to not take him out next week when he's been excited for it for so long.

My partner voiced his desire for shared ownership over the kitten when he heard my mother would be buying me one for my birthday, and has, on many occasions, expressed annoyance at me stating that he's my cat. I am more than happy to do the work myself and take care of him by myself. My partner, however, wants shared ownership and wants to say Kairo (the kitten) is also his. I'm not forcing him to take care of the cat, but I am saying he needs to take responsibility if he wants any of the credit or perks that come with having a pet. If it's OUR kitten, it's OUR job to take care of him, not just mine. He refuses to let me call Kairo ""mine"", so I get upset at the fact he won't do anything to earn his shared ownership.

In the statement of calling the kitten ours, I assumed that we would both share the responsibility of caring for him. My partner did buy some of the necessities, which I am always appreciative of, and I too have bought some things for him, but I was expecting to do so as we were supposed to be sharing all of the responsibilities. I spent three days, by myself, cleaning areas for him, and setting all of his stuff up, so everything was cat safe and to ensure there was enough space for everything he needed.

On the first night, I left them to spend some time together to bond, as my partner had very consistently voiced his concerns about Kairo not liking him, as he really wanted him to.

I am the one to feed him, refill his water, clean and change his litter tray, play with him to tire him out, train him, etc. This entire schedule is essentially what has happened every day since. Genuinely, I don't mind if all he does is the feeding, or giving him fresh water, but the fact I'm doing EVERYTHING alone is bothering me.

As a result of my irritation, he has decided to use my stress as a foundation to take digs at me and make me the butt of his jokes. 

He is also making training Kairo more difficult - I have explained to him how I'm training him. My partner isn't listening to me when I explain ways he can help me train him by simply using the same phrases or noises as me, and is using loads of completely different sounds and words. 
When he finally falls asleep, my partner seems to feel that it's then the best time to do things that will wake him up. I tell him to stop, he doesn't, and then the kitten wakes up and I have to tire him out again, because my partner won't do it himself. 
He also forces the kitten to do things he doesn't seem to want to do, and when I explain to him why he shouldn't be so forceful, as it will cause issues in the long run, he just gets annoyed at both of us. 

I know I may seem like the asshole for expecting him to take responsibility for ""my"" cat, but in reality, he won't let me call the cat mine, so I feel like he should put work in as well if he wants the cat to be his also.

Among not helping me take care of him in general, he is hindering my training, and is simply sat on his PC during it all.

We both have large blended families and agreed to stick to just our parents and grandparents for the first couple of months, MAYBE our siblings if they don’t bring nieces and nephews. Most of our parents and grandparents mentioned getting updated TDap shots without any prompting from us and they generally have a good sense of boundaries. I don’t have any concerns about them visiting in the early days/weeks after delivery.

The tricky part is my FIL. He is a chain smoker and alcoholic who always overstays his welcome when he comes over. He will stay several nights without discussion of any overnights for one reason or another (ex. He drank too much, his car is having problems, he doesn’t feel comfortable driving in the dark). I am absolutely not okay with overnight guests once the baby is here, but specially his father because he is a chain smoker. He smokes outside all day, but this still makes everything about him smell like smoke.

My FIL loves kids and has always been heavily involved in childcare for his other grandchildren. I know he wants to meet our baby and he would feel extremely slighted if all other parents/grandparents were allowed over and not him.

I know he can wash his hands after smoking and put on a smoking jacket, but I am still uncomfortable with him being around our baby. I don’t know if he smokes inside his own home, but he definitely does in his car. I am concerned even if he does things to mitigate the damage, second/third hand smoke could still be an issue. I don’t trust that he would not smoke on his way over or not smoke while visiting our house. I also worry that he will pull the usually “trick” and expect to sleep over, prolonging the smoke exposure and bringing more third hand smoke onto the furniture and around the baby. Sometimes he smokes on our deck without realizing windows are open and it blows inside. I don’t want to have to worry about all of this with a newborn in the middle of summer.

My husband thinks I am overreacting and that it should be enough for his dad to wash his hands/wear a smoking jacket, but I am incredibly uncomfortable with his father being around our baby as long as he is a chain smoker.

33,1dq4990,"AITA for asking for a weekend away with friends, leaving wife to look after 4 month old baby?","My wife and I recently had our first baby. In general it has been going great - however we had our first disagreement earlier today

I had concert tickets with 3 friends to see my all-time favourite band in Sep 2023, in a different city to where we live (approx 5 hours away). However the concert got postponed and it turns out the rescheduled date is a Fri night in Aug 2024 when our baby will be approx 4 months old

By coincidence my favourite football team happens to be playing a really crucial match in the same city on the same weekend. The timing of the match hasn't been confirmed yet, but it will either be Sat lunchtime or Sun lunchtime

So I'd imagined travelling up to the city with my friends on Fri afternoon, going to the concert Fri night, staying in town for the game (either on Sat or Sun afternoon) then travelling back home afterwards. So depending on what day the game was scheduled for, I'd be getting home around 10pm on either the Sat or the Sun

Anyway I mentioned this provisional plan to my wife today, as I wanted to start making travel/hotel bookings, but she was not happy with it. She said it'd be too much for her to be left alone looking after the baby for that length of time. In general I take her point and of course I love our baby more than anything, but imo it is not healthy for our social lives to completely shut down, I still need the occasional night/weekend away with friends otherwise I'll end up stir-crazy (I'm talking like once or twice a year maybe, not any more frequently than that)

In general my social life is very scaled back compared to before (I play sports maybe 1/week now compared to 4/week previously, and see my friends socially maybe 1/month compared to maybe 1/week before)

The division of labour is currently that I am back working full time and my wife is on maternity leave for the rest of 2024. So she is handling most of the childcare by herself Mon-Fri, then on evenings and weekends I am doing as much as I can. I also do all household jobs/chores

If the game is on the Sun then I kinda see her point that it may be too long to be away (~2.5 days in total) but if the game is on Sat I think it's really harsh to block me from going when I'd only be gone for ~1.5 days. We have family living nearby who would be very happy to come and help out while I was away so it's not as if my wife would be totally on her own, and even if she was I'm sure she could handle it as she's an amazingly competent mother

Also it goes without saying that I'd be more than happy to look after the baby solo for a number of days if my wife wanted a trip away with friends, although I don't think she has the desire to as she is very attached to our baby (naturally of course), and even before the baby her social life was  a lot quieter than mine

 Even though I know her since I was 14 yo, sometimes I just stopped talking to her and deleted her contact, most of the time was because she mirrored everything I used to post, I posted a selfie with a specific emoji, she'd do the same, and the list could be long.
 However, ever since we started college, I grew closer with her and I felt bad for my past behavior. But things started changing when she met a classmate and started to like him and he liked her back, by this point we have two other girls in our group and I recently grew up closer with them, so we were four girls doing all the classwork together but, because of the boy, she started to spend more time with him alone, thing that allowed me to get to know the other girls better.

Going back to the main theme, lately, she's been trying to reconect with the group I'm in, which is really awkward because all of us feel like we're walking on eggshells around her. Mostly because she can be nice one day and the next one she's rude or doesn't wanna talk with us.

35,1dq38id,AITA for going off on my husband for bring people into our bedroom?,"I feel really awkward going into this but here it is. 
I(35f) have been married to my husband (36m) for 10 yrs now. Before being married, I kept my bedroom spotless because of bullying I endured in my middle and high school years. In college, I had roommates who were the absolute worst about keeping a clean home and so I had to deal with bugs and frustration from boyfriends I'd bring over but I kept my bedroom clean. 

I have no idea what changed other than my spouse bringing out my inner clutter demons but after marrying him, it was as if I couldn't keep up. First off, he'd ALWAYS have a pile or two of clothes that never went into a closet or drawer and there was always different excuses for these. Whether they were clothes that didn't fit or uniforms that were issued but he couldn't wear for some reason, they just stayed there. Then add that every surface of our home turned into a clutter because if he was fixing something, he'd leave the tools on the table and never put them away or leave receipts or mail etc. Then I started doing it. Mostly because I got sick of cleaning it up and/or what I'd clean, I'd be berated for it because I threw away something he needed.
 
So fast forward to having a baby where I just lost control of everything. I got on meds to help me with PPD/PPA and slowly I've been getting the home back and these meds have helped me get my sense of cleaning back so I've been working on our home. But our bedroom is just not working. So I've asked him numerous times to not let people into the room. I'm embarrassed by it. By my mental state. 

But he doesn't listen and because he's stored our safe in the master bdrm, he brings everyone in there to show off guns. I've asked him to quit when it was my family at first. But I mostly trust my family not to spread it around that my room is just bad. My dad made comments like ""looks like your room when you were younger"" as if it's only my fault that our room is disgusting. 

But here is where I may be the a**hole- he had a friend and his wife stay with us and let them come into our bedroom to show off guns. I've been bullied horribly already by military spouse's already and now this spouse knows just how bad and disgusting my room is. I'm so embarrassed that I literally don't want to go to another spouse function cause it's like a horrible little secret and she knows it. So I went off on him in a ""How many F*king times do I have to tell you that I don't want people in our room? Are you dense? Do you hear me when I've asked so many times?"" 

He said that was messed up and that if I didn't like it then clean it up. That's absolutely true that I should clean my side of the old soda, Gatorade, trash and clothes. But he is just as bad on his side and if I throw away something important, he's going to get angry with me again. 

AITA? 

I want to add that the military spouse's never bullied me because of my room but rather because of my house being cluttered in general and some random drama.

37,1dq24rs,AITA for telling my partners mom to leave the hospital my partner is staying at,"I (30F) have been with my partner (31M) for 5 years but we were friends for 10 years prior to beginning the relationship. We aren’t married (yet) and I don’t have an engagement ring but we have established that we will be getting married, hopefully next year.

On Monday my partner came home from work around noon with intense stomach pains and vomiting. It was bad enough he wanted to go to the ER, something he’d usually avoid at all costs. We live with his parents at the moment so we asked his mom to drive us there. I won’t go into detail about what exactly his health issue is, but it’s bad enough that he needs an extended stay in the ICU and is sedated and intubated. The first night they didn’t think it was quite this serious, so I volunteered to let his mother stay with him that night with the idea I’d be staying the next night. It made sense because I had not slept in over 24 hours by that point, so she’d be more aware of what was going on that night while I went home for some sleep. The following day he still didn’t seem too bad but she informed me she would not be leaving and the hospital only allows one family member to stay over night. I told her no, I was staying that night and she refused to leave so I had no choice but to leave since we aren’t married yet and legally she has say over everything.

Every day she has said I can stay the following night and every day she tells me she isn’t leaving when visiting hours end and I end up needing to leave. Today is Thursday and I’ve informed her that I WILL be staying tonight and that what she’s doing isn’t fair. We promised to spend our lives together and I should be by his side when he’s taken off the vent and wakes up. She still refuses to go and says she will have me removed if she has to.

Now here’s where I think I’m definitely an asshole. My partners older brother sadly passed away just a month and a half ago, so of course his mother is scared to death she’s losing her other child. I completely understand and respect that and I feel for her. But she has absolutely no regard for my feelings in this situation, going as far as to tell me I was not allowed to cry when she saw me break down because I have to be strong for her. As if I’m not allowed to feel my emotions at all with the love of my life in the ICU. She and I have never really gotten along and I know this is when we should be coming together with our love for my partner, not arguing with each other. I just want to stay by his side. It would be one thing if we hadn’t been together so long but this is my partner. I’ve been the one keeping everyone updated, taking care of his responsibilities and asking the doctors the questions that matter. I think I should be allowed at least one night with my partner instead of being at home looking after her husband.

So, am I the asshole?

Edit: I’d like to clear a few things up.

1. Just because I don’t have a ring doesn’t mean we aren’t engaged. We have established we will marry as well as a timeline. That’s as engaged as it gets, I think. We all do things differently.

2. Staying with my partners parents is a mutually beneficial agreement. Every time we mention possibly wanting to move out she sits us down and asks us not to. I pay to live there with them but it’s much less than I would pay elsewhere and she likes having the help of having her son around to drive her places and help take care of other things. We also pay her car insurance and phone bill.

3. We asked her to drive there because he was in too much pain and for medical reasons I cannot drive. Like legally, I cannot drive because of a medical condition.

Disabled people exist, assuming someone is “less of an adult” because they can’t drive or live with their parents is wild to me. But I guess that’s on me for not providing more detail.

All this being said, after a talk with her yesterday she decided to let me stay last night. I explained that he’s the man I chose to spend my life with and that it’s been impossible for me to rest being at home away from him every single night. I asked her to try and understand that while I know she’s in pain and struggling with this, I am too and I just would like if she’d at least acknowledge that I want to be here for him. She argued at first and we both cried then later in the day she told me I could stay. It’s early morning and we’re sitting here together now.

Honestly, I’m glad I was able to get through to her about my feelings and I’m also glad she got a chance to go home and shower and sleep in her own bed. I’m hoping over the rest of the stay I can just get every few nights.

38,1dq23cj,AITA for disinviting a “friend” from an event after she gave my ticket to her sister?,"Back when Eras tour tickets were released, my friend Sadie said she would grab us tickets and I’d pay her back. We made concrete plans and I was excited. I’ve been a Swiftie for years but haven't seen her live. I had to sell my Rep stadium tour tickets back in the 2010s because my mom was dying and I needed the money to help pay medical bills. I booked the hotel.

This past weekend I was having a little get together for a bunch of friends and Sadie was of course invited. At some point she pulled me aside and told me that she had news, she is leaving in September. I was heartbroken! We’ve been friends for years and I love spending time with her. I got weepy and hugged her a bunch and said that we needed to get all our thrifting trips in over the summer and hang out as much as we could.

Then she broke the news that as a way to bond with her sister before she left, she was going to be taking her to the Eras tour instead. I didn’t know how to react. She stood in front of me and Venmo’d my payment back.

She was like “I know you understand.”

I said that this was a sneaky move and honestly really shitty of her, and I don’t understand how or why she would do that to me.

She got defensive and said that they were under her name and that she didn’t “owe me” anything.

I was like yes, they are your tickets. Legally, you can do whatever you want. But this is still a really shitty and sneaky thing to do to your friend, knowing that there is no way I will be able to get my own tickets at this point.

She just kind of shrugged and said “Sorry, but I figured you’d understand.”

I asked her to leave, and told her to please not come back for the 4th of July party next week. I said I needed to process this and that I’m really disappointed with her and how she’s treated me. This is a girl who I consoled through breakups, job losses, pet losses, etc. She looked shocked and asked if I was serious.

She ended up stomping off and leaving and texted me later to tell me that she’s “around” if I want to apologize for making HER feel bad about taking her sister on a “bonding” trip.

I’m honestly heartbroken that I’m going to be watching “my” show on a grainy livestream instead of being there in the stadium with everyone. I was looking forward to this so much. I checked the resale sites and had a sad little cry about it. I am wondering if I am completely wrong to have just uninvited her. Is that too far? If it was in, say, a month or two, I don’t think I would have. I just need time?

Back when Eras tour tickets were released, my friend Sadie said she would grab us tickets and I’d pay her back. We made concrete plans and I was excited. I’ve been a Swiftie for years but haven't seen her live. I had to sell my Rep stadium tour tickets back in the 2010s because my mom was dying and I needed the money to help pay medical bills. I booked the hotel.

This past weekend I was having a little get together for a bunch of friends and Sadie was of course invited. At some point she pulled me aside and told me that she had news, she is leaving in September. I was heartbroken! We’ve been friends for years and I love spending time with her. I got weepy and hugged her a bunch and said that we needed to get all our thrifting trips in over the summer and hang out as much as we could.

Then she broke the news that as a way to bond with her sister before she left, she was going to be taking her to the Eras tour instead. I didn’t know how to react. She stood in front of me and Venmo’d my payment back.

She was like “I know you understand.”

I said that this was a sneaky move and honestly really shitty of her, and I don’t understand how or why she would do that to me.

She got defensive and said that they were under her name and that she didn’t “owe me” anything.

39,1dq1mbk,AITAH for alternating 4th of July holiday with family,"
I’ve (41F) been married for 17 years. Every major holiday my husband (42M) and I alternate with our respective families since we’ve been married. Christmas with my side, Thanksgiving with his, Easter with mine, etc, etc. It has worked out just fine. We have 3 kids (oldest is 11). We do this every year, except the 4th of July. He grew up on a lake, I didn’t. So the 4th was just off of the alternating list- we didn’t have a convo that we can’t alternate- it just was by default with his side since they live on a lake (we don’t but are in the same town as his side). My family is further away. So year after year I’ve gone along with it- all the while my side has asked to get together and I never even entertained it knowing I’d get push back from my husband. So to sum it up- I’ve never officially agreed we’d do the 4th with his side yearly, just never put my foot down and said enough. So this year (in Feb) I said “hey, it’s time we start alternating the 4th as my side would love to get together at their place and my parents are getting older etc (it would be out of town, where my family is located) - Side note: we all get along so my fam and his fam are fine, it’s just too many people to all be together. 
He just gets upset and thinks my side “doesn’t get together” (they do) and that his “family has ties to the 4th” (ummmm what does that mean? Yes we are all citizens.) And thinks I’m being unreasonable. He thinks I’m being inflexible. 
I’m just asking for every OTHER, not EVERY 4th. I don’t think being with his side on the actually holiday is fair every year and to just say that mine should get together another weekend randomly when time off is an issue, etc.

40,1dq1k9x,AITA For following through on a promise I made to my wife about bringing home another animal,"My wife (33F) and I (34M) have been married for 5 years.  When we married, I had a dog and she had a cat.  We have since gotten another dog and 2 cats through a local rescue agency.  My dog is getting older and is starting to have some health issues.  Two of the cats have health issues as well.  Nothing life-threatening, but they do require medication and/or special care.  

The last cat we got was one that my wife brought home on her own after visiting the rescue agency about an unrelated question.  She saw the cat and ""just had to bring her home.""  This was about 6 months ago.  I told her at the time that bringing home animals needs to be something we discuss together beforehand.  We already have pets with health issues and bringing strange animals into their home isn't a good idea.  She apologized and agreed that any future pets would be discussed and agreed upon beforehand.  I told her that if she brings home another animal without talking to me about it first, I will bring it right back to the rescue agency until we have a chance to talk about it.  

This brings us to last week.  I had to run some errands over my lunch break and made a quick stop at home.  While there, I heard a very faint mewing sound and thought one of the cats was stuck somewhere.  But as I was looking around, I noticed all 3 of our cats following me.  Eventually, the sound led me to a closed closet at the end of a hallway.  

Inside was a cat-carrier with a cat I had never seen before.  I picked it up, brought it to my car, and drove it straight to the rescue agency.  They told me my wife hadn't gotten the cat from them, but they would take it (don't worry, it's a no-kill shelter).  I went back to work and went about my day like normal.  I never texted or called my wife about the cat.  

That night, I waited for my wife to bring up the cat, but she never did.  It was becoming clear that she was trying to hide it from me.  It wasn't until I got home from work the next day that she finally came clean.  She asked me if I had taken the cat to the shelter and I told her I did.  She started crying and told me that she was just holding it for someone else because she saw it on a Facebook group and she wanted to help.  She said she never had any intention of keeping it and that she already had a home lined up for it and now she has to call them and tell them what I did.

I asked her why she would try to hide the cat from me if that was what she was planning.  I told her that was something that we could have discussed together instead of her going behind my back and trying to sneak around.  She told me she was going to bring it to our vet before bringing it to the new family and it was only going to be in our house for one night.

She's pissed at me for bringing it to the shelter, but I feel like I did exactly what I told her I would do in this scenario.

This is my first post on here and I'm not used to doing this so bear with me on any spelling mistakes please.

I told one of my closest friends (21f) that she didn't have to worry about paying the amount anymore because I terminated my work contract but she gets mad at me for doing it and stating that she got a loan for it and to help her pay her bills. Mind you the cost to join was only $124 US dollars. If anyone has gotten a loan we know that banks make it to where you have to make a loan of a couple thousands at most. I tried to explain to her why i canceled it which was that no one communicated to me and I told her it wasn't my fault she took out a loan and that no one asked her to, I told her if she had communicated to me sooner about wether or not she was still interested I would have told her not to take out that loan then because she didn't need to do that to do this.

My husband’s family has never initiated a close relationship with me. I’m very shy and I have a hard time getting close to people even though I really want to. When we got married, they complained why we were marrying young since in 🇵🇭,some parents want a lot of financial support. But we married at 23 and 24 so I could sponsor him to 🇨🇦 we were 7yrs at that point and we paid for everything. His mom thinks he’s only supporting my fam but we all work here, he has defended me but I still think they dislike me because of this.

My brother in law had a girlfriend for about 2 ish yrs. They LOVE her. She has issues at home, so she would stay with them for months. I went home 🇵🇭 and I really got along with her, no issues. Even if I wasn’t as close to them as she was, I didn’t blame her because it’s a them problem. They recently broke up last yr because he started seeing someone else. I hated him for that and felt for her. He was together with new gf before his ex, and they found their way into each other again.

BUT earlier this year, he had an accident and has TBI, he is still recovering. His new gf visited him in the hospital and they just so unfairly attacked her. His sister messaged her after to respect the family, to stay away, they only knew the ex to be the girlfriend while she traveled 4 hours to see him. I am not condoning third parties but I strongly believed they did not have the right to dismiss her that way. And I just had flashbacks of their coldness towards me and while they never directly attacked me like that, I felt what she felt if that makes sense.

The ex has NOT gotten back with him. But she still goes on 🇵🇭vacations with the whole family. She still visits him while he’s recovering. She’s still going to fly home to him for his birthday. 

We are going to the Philippines soon, we’re planning a beach holiday. Out of nowhere, the sister invites the ex. For some reason, I had an overreaction and lost it because A) we’re paying for the trip including the 5 star hotel,high end restaurants for his family except the ✈️ B) they’re no longer together C) my family is going and I didn’t even approve my aunt going because I thought it was immediate family only D) WE DIDN’T INVITE HER and E) maybe a little part of me is jealous they never thought of me like that. My husband told them we’re paying, it’s best if we don’t bring anyone else. His sister defends she’s family. Her last message seemed to hint they are just going to pay for a hotel of their own for the 3 of them( her, husband and ex). So idk. I really don’t want to go with her. She is a lovely person but she’s a representation of my almost non existent relationship with them LOL.

And I just had flashbacks of their coldness towards me and while they never directly attacked me like that, I felt what she felt if that makes sense.

The ex has NOT gotten back with him. But she still goes on 🇵🇭vacations with the whole family. She still visits him while he’s recovering. She’s still going to fly home to him for his birthday. 

We are going to the Philippines soon, we’re planning a beach holiday. Out of nowhere, the sister invites the ex. For some reason, I had an overreaction and lost it because A) we’re paying for the trip including the 5 star hotel,high end restaurants for his family except the ✈️ B) they’re no longer together C) my family is going and I didn’t even approve my aunt going because I thought it was immediate family only D) WE DIDN’T INVITE HER and E) maybe a little part of me is jealous they never thought of me like that. My husband told them we’re paying, it’s best if we don’t bring anyone else. His sister defends she’s family. Her last message seemed to hint they are just going to pay for a hotel of their own for the 3 of them( her, husband and ex). So idk. I really don’t want to go with her. She is a lovely person but she’s a representation of my almost non existent relationship with them LOL. I may cry at some of ur comments lol but I appreciate any advice.",0.0,0.0047360435128211975,0,1

47,1dq0lla,AITA for going on a girls trip,"Hi! My friend and I planned on going to a beach vacation in August. We set the dates and booked out flights last week. My boyfriend knew we were planning it and knew the dates a bit before that. We live together and have a dog, which he agreed to look after while I'm away (just 4 days). This is kind of a big deal since I am the primary owner (walks, feeding, vet, baths, etc). 
Well, yesterday he went out with his buddies and they invited him to a boy's trip that matches the EXACT DATES of my vacation. He said that he knew that he can't go since he has to stay at home with the dog. I empathised with him and said that it was just an unfortunate coincidence and that was it, we didn't mention it after that. 
Today, out of nowhere he started an argument that I was not considerate of him and his plans and if I wanted to find a way so we could both attend the vacations, I could have done it and that I'm selfish. 
The thing is, noone can watch our dog for us. We have no relatives in the city we live in, our friends won't be available to watch him and my trip has already been arranged, the flights and hotels are non-refundable. We can't take the dog since Ryanair doesn't allow pets. 
In my opinion, he has to stay home since we already had an agreement.

48,1dq0idg,AITA for making my wife a smoothie at an inconvenient time?,"My wife (34f) and I (31m) of 2 years have been at odds over everything lately, so she seems to be extra sensitive and critical (which is a huge contributing factor to our issues). It feels like there is nothing I can do that can help bring her back to a level state. Some more backstory: my wife goes to the bathroom every morning to poop, which always takes at least 30 minutes. The time that she goes to the bathroom is different every day.

Anyway, last night, my wife asked if I could make her a smoothie this morning before I leave for the gym at 10:30am. I happily said that I'd be glad to. This morning comes around and at 10:15am, I start making her smoothie while she is upstairs working. She came downstairs when I was halfway done making her smoothie and in an irritated tone asks why I was making her smoothie right then. I replied that she asked me to make her a smoothie before I go to the gym, which I will do as soon as I'm done making her smoothie. She replied that I should know that she hasn't pooped yet so I shouldn't be making the smoothie yet. I felt frustrated that my good-faith attempt to do something nice for her resulted in her being immediately negative and critical (this is a very common occurrence for her), not grateful whatsoever. I told her that I can just put it in the freezer for her, and she can have it once she's done in the bathroom. In a huff, she closed the bathroom door and called out that, ""It's fine, I guess.""

When I wanted to talk about it later, I reminded her that I was just doing what she had asked me to. She again said that I should have known that it was not a good time to make her a smoothie, and she prefers having a smoothie that has not been put in the freezer. I understood her perspective, however negative and lacking thankfulness it was. I started to say again that I was just doing what she had asked, and before I could say another word she loudly interrupted me and said that she already heard me say that, and that I was not listening to her. Agitated (given that she is constantly interrupting me during discussions like these), I asked her not to interrupt me, and she replied that she didn't need to hear me say anything else. I asked her how could she know what else I had to say. She condescendingly asked me to enlighten her with what else I wanted to add. I told her that I could have asked her this morning if she still wanted me to make her a smoothie, and I'm sorry that I didn't.

At no point did she apologize for being so negative when I was just trying to do something nice for her, or for interrupting me when I was trying to acknowledge her perspective.

55,1dpzc67,WIBTA If my made my mom professionally clean her home before my son visits her home?,"For context: I (28F) grew up with my mom (51F) being a single mother. My mom certainly did her best but she did not clean or keep a clean home. We had dogs that used the bathroom all over the inside of our house that stayed there for days, had flea/bug infestations regularly, mold growing on dirty dishes for weeks, etc. I never was taught or learned how to clean until I moved away for college and lived on my own. 

My mom eventually remarried but my stepdad does not help to clean or clean the house at all. While her living conditions are better and she cleans occasionally (not correctly but tries), her house is very much the same in a lot of ways.

She is the exact opposite of the stereotype of stepmoms. She is kind, generous, and has been wonderful to my father. She is not however my mother and I just feel that we are more on the friend basis rather than stepmom/stepdaughter.   I don’t however see her as my Mom.  I have a mother.  My relationship has been strained with her because of her need to always put herself above everyone else.  She refused to ever work and contribute to household finances.  This may have been fine but she was a poor housekeeper and often dumped household chores and babysitting duties (younger siblings) on me.   This trait in my Mom was a lot of the reason that my parents divorced. Dad was no angel because he dealt with problems in the marriage by cheating.

My Dad has been so excited about his first grandchild.  He has been constantly referring to himself and his wife as Grandpa and Grandma. I ignored it for a while but finally I felt that I had to speak up. I explained  gentle-like that Jane could not be referred to as “Grandma”.  I could tell that he was really hurt when he asked why.

Dad left the house and went outside to water his garden not returning inside for the rest of the visit.

I had a conversation with my stepmom and she understood where I was coming from. Together we decided that the baby could call her Mamaw.

59,1dpyuje,AITA for no longer wanting my MIL to cook my family meals once a week?,"My MIL watches my wife and I’s daughter after my daughter gets home from school a few days a week. We’re very grateful for the support. For four years now, one day a week, my MIL creates a dinner meal around 1 or 2 PM meant to be baked in the oven 30 min when my wife and I get home around 5PM. My MIL picks the meal, buys ingredients, and prepares it on her own. I think that’s very thoughtful and originally it was great while my wife and I were still adjusting to life with a toddler, so we didn’t have to worry about come up with a dinner 7 nights a week. 

The problem is these dinners my MIL are making aren’t good usually. 1 of 10 of the are good/okay, 2 of 10 are meh but still eatable, and 7 of 10 of them are usually bad. When I say bad, I find myself picking at it and not eating much. I notice my wife doing the same. Often 75% of this dish is getting tossed in the garbage. Usually the texture is bad do to how it’s prepared, and the cuts of meat are the lowest quality with unchewable/fatty bits in it and just tastes off. Other ingredients are cheap off-brand ingredients. Example: she’s finding things like a pasta sauce brand at dollar stores that no one’s ever heard of and just taste bad. Since the meals are getting made in advance often the middle of the dish is getting overly soft and mushy while the outside might get overly dry and crispy due to getting cooked in the oven.

Between my daughter now being older and having more sports/activities nights where we don’t do a sit-down dinner, MIL dinner, maybe eat out or take out once a week, and being busy with things on the weekend it makes it more difficult to have flexibility on making a nice dinner.  Some weeks the only chance we get to have a sit-down dinner is the MIL dinner which ends up being bad.  I’d prefer to use that opportunity to cook something of normal quality.

When my wife asked me about this, I was honest and basically said that I’m not really into the MIL meals and also now that our daughter is older, maybe it’s time that we politely decline these meals because I feel bad about wasting my MIL’s time, money and energy by cooking these only to throw it away.   My wife freaking lost it.
Per my wife, I’m cold for even thinking this way. And “who else do we have that’s bringing us cooked meals each week?!”. My counter point is we don’t need anyone bringing us meals and does the MIL know that we’re barely eating this food and just throwing it away? 

I would take no pleasure in telling my MIL that we’re no longer interested in this help. But I’d do it gently and tactfully, like remind about the history of how/why it stated, but now things are running smoother, and we’d like to have more flexibility on cooking our own meals.

My late wife's brother(M57), who I(m47) always got along well with, was dealing with a marriage breakup. He was still cohabitating in the home he shared with his ex, a step kid and one of his kids. And things were getting difficult there for him, It was in the middle of nowhere, he had no money, had to borrow money from her for gas anytime he needed to go into town, and the straw that broke the camels back so to say was that she was shacking up with different men every few weeks(including a few cousins).

So i agreed to let him stay with me in my house for a few (3-4 months) to get back on his feet, as long as he paid some $ towards electrical/water/internet/etc and did some of the repair work that needed to be done around the house since I was always short of time and his profession is as a handyman/carpenter/roofer. only rules I had were no smoking in the house, no drugs, and no random woman. as I had a kid still living at home.



After 8 months of skyrocketed bills(before he moved in my hydro bills were 150-200/m after he moved in 425-450 was average), of the list of things were agreed he would work on (stairs, front door, deck, drywall repairs, insulating an outbuilding, fixing a leaking outdoor hose bib, and some landscaping) he had done 1(door). 



At the time I was living home a week and living with my GF a week, but living with him at all sucked and I was unable to stand sharing a home with him



In that time he started smoking in the spare room, leaving drinks all over. started building a shed in my backyard without permission, so we gave him a letter giving him 60 days to leave. Needless to say, he filled out and started bad-mouthing me and GF to EVERYONE he could(family, friends, neighbors, etc) Apparently, we are scum, assholes, and every other derogatory term he could think of.

The aftermath, once he was finally out, it took weeks to clean up the mess he left. He played around with some of the electrical in the house(like WTF), smelled like he dumped a ton of beer in the Hottub, Pissed all over the bathroom(how the fuck do you piss on top of a toilet tank), broken beer bottles several places in the back yard, broken tools, piles of wood from him having to remove his shed, dead grass where he killed it, none of the work he said he would do done at all, apparently he use all the propane in the tanks I had for the BBQ and thought he would use scrap wood and burn it in the BBQ to cook with. Sure im still going to find other things.

Most of the extended family think I was being too harsh and should have let him live here indefinitely. I suggested maybe they should let him stay with them, but unsurprisingly, no one agreed. Not one of his many siblings would take him in, nor would any of his five adult children.

For the past few years, Sarah has hosted a 4th of July party at her house which Noelle and her family always attend along with Sarah's other friends and family members. My family and I have never been invited nor attended. However, this year, Sarah is considering not having her 4th of July party because she doesn't want the stress of it all. 

I figured, well since Noelle might not be going to Sarah's for the 4th then I would invite her and her family to my house. I also extended the invitation to Sarah and her family. I make it very clear that if Sarah changes her mind and decides to go ahead and host her usual party at her house, my feelings will not be hurt. They are very appreciative, thank me for the invite and say they will let me know. 

This is already out of my comfort zone since I am pretty introverted and not a social butterfly. Hosting makes me feel awkward and stressed, but I want my best friend to come over without making her feel like she is betraying her other best friend. 

Last night I get word from Noelle that Sarah is considering my invite but she is planning on asking me if her other friends, their families and her parents could come too. So, her usual guest list, but at my house. This will probably end up being about 15 extra people that are either acquaintances of mine or complete strangers. Hypothetically, Sarah will have all her people around her and I'll be feeling uncomfortable and most likely excluded in my own home. 

So, WIBTA if I tell her no additional guests allowed or should I just suck it up and say the more the merrier?

For the past few years, Sarah has hosted a 4th of July party at her house which Noelle and her family always attend along with Sarah's other friends and family members. My family and I have never been invited nor attended. However, this year, Sarah is considering not having her 4th of July party because she doesn't want the stress of it all. 

I figured, well since Noelle might not be going to Sarah's for the 4th then I would invite her and her family to my house. I also extended the invitation to Sarah and her family. I make it very clear that if Sarah changes her mind and decides to go ahead and host her usual party at her house, my feelings will not be hurt. They are very appreciative, thank me for the invite and say they will let me know. 

This is already out of my comfort zone since I am pretty introverted and not a social butterfly. Hosting makes me feel awkward and stressed, but I want my best friend to come over without making her feel like she is betraying her other best friend. 

Last night I get word from Noelle that Sarah is considering my invite but she is planning on asking me if her other friends, their families and her parents could come too. So, her usual guest list, but at my house. This will probably end up being about 15 extra people that are either acquaintances of mine or complete strangers. Hypothetically, Sarah will have all her people around her and I'll be feeling uncomfortable and most likely excluded in my own home. 

So, WIBTA if I tell her no additional guests allowed or should I just suck it up and say the more the merrier?

64,1dpyf2e,AITA for telling the people my step siblings invited back from the bar to leave?,"I live at home with my stepsisters, stepdad and mum. I’m 24, living at home to save. Stepsisters are 21 and 24. 

I’m lucky to live at home and know it’s not my house, so abide by whatever my parents rules are. They’re not unreasonable and are extremely generous to the 3 of us. 
A few times the girls have brought a group of guys back from nights out, once, they were really loud and kept me up until 3, even though I went down and asked them to keep it down and sit in a room that wasn’t directly under mine. (It was a weeknight and we all have full time jobs) they kept my mum and step dad up too, drank a lot of their drinks and made a big mess which they never clean up, it’s always left to me or my parents. 

They have had the same guys back 3 times since, and i haven’t said anything, but again drank loads of alcohol they didn’t buy and and made a big mess. 

On Monday we all went to the bar. I left with my stepdad, and we said to them not to bring the guys back but they did.
The tv and them all talking at 1 woke me up. We have another room with a couch and a tv on the other side of the house, which doesn’t disturb anyone, so idk why they don’t sit in there. 
I texted and asked them to sit somewhere else. They said they would but didn’t. So half an hour later I went down to tell them all to move into a different room. Neither of the girls said much but the boys said they were leaving, but were pretty shitty about it. 
I went upstairs, heard them all talking about me overreacting, they weren’t even that loud etc, etc. I think if it’s a weeknight it’s so unfair to keep me and everyone else up. 
The noise stopped 20 minutes later around 2. The next morning I go downstairs and the kitchen and living room are so messy, wine bottles and glasses everywhere, pans all over the kitchen, and tobacco sprinkled on the counter. It turned out they also drank fancy whisky my step dad was saving and broke 3 glasses my mum had just bought. 

My mum and stepdad were furious, as they felt very disrespected by everyone coming in, drinking all their alcohol and eating loads of our food and making so much mess. They have both said something to my stepsisters, who haven’t even apologised and don’t see what they did wrong and they are now avoiding all of us. Their excuse is that they were drunk so didn’t pay attention to what they were doing, and that they would have cleaned up that night after work. (Idk why they think it would be ok to leave all the mess for a whole day)
The sister who I’m closer to, is now fully ignoring me for being on the side of our parents and coming down and ruining their fun. They think I’m boring for not just going along with it all and that I’m the one being unreasonable by telling them to be quiet/not thinking it’s all ‘so fun’. 

AITA? I wanted to know if there’s maybe another pov I should be taking?

65,1dpxter,AITA Husband's Apple Watch Annoys Me when he looks at it mid-conversation ,"My husband and I just got in a little argument because I became visibly annoyed when he checked his Apple Watch mid conversation. It vibrates during every conversation we have and interrupts my train of thought when he refocuses his gaze and attention to the watch. I know this may  sound too sensitive, but it feels dismissive of what I'm saying. 
Usually the notification is to remind him to exercise and he'll make a comment after he looks at it 'oh, it just wants mw to do jumping jacks'. I usually just ignore him checking it, but I was grumpy this morning and rolled my eyes and shook my head when it buzzed and he said 'oh, it's reminding me to do jumping jacks'. I just want one conversation without that dumb watch interrupting. He's a great guy so I try to let little things go, but this watch is really annoying me for some reason. Am I being an intolerant jerk getting annoyed by his watch? 

Edit-I expressed to him when he first got it a couple years ago that I find it annoying when he is distracted by it vibrating mid conversation. He said its natural to look at something when it vibrates and implied I shouldn't be annoyed. I am very intolerant when people get distracted mid conversation, which is why I'm asking if this is a me problem. It just seems no different than having your phone buzz mid conversation. The watch is never buzzing for anything important-always just reminding him to move or do jumping jacks. We have a treadmill and a rower, and I feel like if movement is that important that the reminders to move need to interrupt conversations, he should just actually use our exercise equipment. 
Edit again- we discussed it again and he offered to pause the notifications. I told him not to worry about it and that I'd be more tolerant. Turns out the offer was all I needed to feel considered and validated, not the actual ceasing of checking it when it vibrates. Thank you for all the thoughtful responses.

66,1dpxleg,AITA for asking my sister to clean,"My younger sister asked last week if she and her friends could stay at my place after they went to the club since my home was closer. I made it clear at the time I’m working flat out 15 hour shifts all of this week so if she wanted people she’d have to come clean. Nothing insane just replace the bed linens (that she was the last person to use and I’d already washed them she just had to put them back on the beds she’d be using.) and do the dishes I didn’t have time to do before leaving for work (2 bowls).

 I was under the impression her friends would only be here after the club so when I seen my sister appearing at my home at 10am on the ring doorbell I was a bit confused and asked her about it. At this point she rudely told me obviously her friends were pregaming at my place. At which point I asked her to do the dishes sat in the kitchen since I didn’t want people seeing dirty dishes in my home.

I’d also like to point out she half assed putting on the bedsheets claiming she didn’t know how so I had to go around behind her fixing them.

She point blank refused stating they were mine so why should she. I pointed out I had put away the rubbish she’d left behind in the guest room last time so she owed a favour if she wanted to play that game. She proceeded to dump the bin out, find the rubbish I was speaking about and try to deny it was hers. 

She eventually called someone to come get her after I said she wouldn’t be allowed to stay here again if she was going to be this difficult every time. She called someone to come get her and stormed off. I wasn’t unreasonable and was going to still let her stay tonight since she was already here but now she’s obviously told my parents an  insane version of events and they’re pissed at me.

67,1dpxfqb,AITA for not letting my roommates watch TV when I stay at the apartment.,"I (31m) let my friend (29m) move into my apartment because he needed a place to stay. Long story short, his GF (30m) ended up moving in as well. 

Despite having 3 people in the apartment, it works out very well because I spend the evenings/ nights at my partner's house. So I essentially come home in the morning, work until 5pm, then pack up and leave for my partner's. My apartment is essentially just my office. 

This is except for Thursdays. My partner has a long meeting with his business partner every Thursday, so I usually stay home. When this happens, I usually have dinner made and am watching tv (catching up on a show my partner hates) by the time my roommates come home. I will then usually watch my TV show until around 8pm. 

Well the other day my roommate confronted me and asked that I let them have the TV to eat their dinner on the nights that I stay at the apartment. I told him no, I will not accommodate them. However, I told them that they are welcome to join me in the living room. 

My roommate told me that I'm being inconsiderate and that it's not fair that they need to eat in their bedroom because I am ""hogging the livingroom."" 

Now, there are some important details I'd like to note: 

1. The TV show they watch is entirely in Japanese, and I am unable to watch or understand any of it. 
2. It is my TV (everything in the apartment I own)
3. They can use the TV, or anything else in the apartment, uninterrupted 6 days of the week. I am just asking for one day to catch up on a tv show I enjoy.

69,1dpxcfk,AITA for asking to take someones place in a big project? ,"Hello Reddit. I am feeling very down recently and am stuck in a dilemma on what to do and if my thoughts and feelings are justified.

I study composition at a music university and will graduate in the summer of next year. I would say the style I write in is more easy on the ears, than what most people would expect from contemporary classical music. I like using ""singable"" melodies from time to time and like using  extended triads. I also use new techniques but more as decoration, than as the substance of a piece. 

Every semester some projects presented to the class. We have the option to write for a string quartet, short opera, New Music Ensemble, Orchestra, etc.
In the last two semesters I had applied for multiple things. First I applied for a project, where the instrumentation was still not announced. The professor told me, he would tell me the instruments once he gets the news, so I could start writing. I didn't hear anything for three months and when I asked, he said the project was canceled, because no one applied for it...
I told him I applied and showed him the email and his answer from back then. He told me I would definately get a project next semester, so I applied for it. The same problem came up again, with unclear instrumentation. This time I asked for updates almost every week, because I didn't want to get forgotten again. Thenafter two months Iwas told that project was also cancelled, due to bureaucracy problems.
Now I had applied for a big project, so I could graduate with something nice, that I know will definately not be cancelled.

Today it was revealed, that I don't get to take part in the project, and it will go to other composers from the class. The thing is, that all of these composers have had multiple projects and concerts throughout their studies, while almost all of mine were cancelled. From my point of view it feels like pure favoritism. We didn't have to hand in any sketches or anything. It was purely the choice of the professors. 

One of the composers, that take part in the big project have had other projects even, that were way bigger than what anyone else in the class had access to. A string Orchestra piece that is 30 minutes long, while everyone else has to limit themselves to solo pieces or small ensemble pieces with a maximum length of 15 minutes. And another piece for ensemble, that takes 30 minutes.
At this concert I could only perform 3 short  movements of my piece (about 9 minutes alltogether), so there was more time for this composer. 
I'm thinking of writing an email and complaining about this. Also pointing out that this one composer has had all of these projects and doesn't necessarily need another huge one.

70,1dpxb6q,AITA for not inviting my brother and SIL over because of what happened at the last family gathering?,"At our last big family gathering (which included extended family) there was an argument between myself and my brother’s wife.

I was in charge of making up leftover plates for anyone to take home if they wanted. I gave John (my brother) and Lucy (his wife) 3 plates of food including the leftovers of the dishes they brought with them. I gave them to John to put in his cooler in his car before they left. The next day, I got a call from Lucy asking if I gave my brother the food, which I said I did. She told me there was only one plate that was half empty instead of the 3 plates and 2 tupperware boxes I had actually given my brother. I was confused and said John took them off the counter so ask him.

Well, John told Lucy I had ‘refused’ to give them the extra food and kept it for myself. Lucy was not pleased by this and told everyone in our family that I had ‘stolen’ their food. I maintained my innocence the entire time because this isn’t what happened.

If that was all it was, I wouldn’t have minded but Lucy took it way too personally. She began to insult my body and weight, saying I ‘didn’t need burgers and should have stolen the salad instead’, and said she doesn’t blame me for stealing because I’m so poor and work a dead-end job. Lucy’s animosity didn’t stop for over a year, and she would always bring it up any chance she got.

I’m the one hosting this year and I have not invited John or Lucy. When they asked why they didn’t receive an invitation, I said ‘are you kidding?’ and hung up. Not the most mature, but I was so shocked at their audacity to ask.

My brother text me to suggest a sit down between myself and Lucy but I didn’t get the point of that since she will always think of me as a villain in this ridiculous story.

It was then that my brother confessed that he ate all the ‘missing’ food in the car and felt so embarrassed by it that he lied to Lucy about me refusing to give them the food. I was in awe. I knew he had lied but not the details or why he lied. I told him he’s a huge asshole here and he needs to come clean to Lucy now. I guess he did because Lucy then called me, apologising profusely. She said she had no reason to doubt my brother and she was already feeling left out and an outsider so she lashed out. I thanked her for her apology but said I didn’t forgive her- she said so many awful things to me over 2 missing plates of food.

I said they still weren’t invited to the gathering and that they are welcome to host their own (which I obviously wouldn't attend). This made my brother really mad (they were on speaker together).

A few hours later I got some texts from our mum telling me to just 'get over it' and invite Lucy and John. I just put my foot down and said if they show up, they won't be let in my home.

The whole situation was caused a rift in the family. Half are telling me I can't not include my brother and the other half are saying Lucy is a bitch for her comments. Lucy and John are still very mad.

Well, John told Lucy I had ‘refused’ to give them the extra food and kept it for myself. Lucy was not pleased by this and told everyone in our family that I had ‘stolen’ their food. I maintained my innocence the entire time because this isn’t what happened.

If that was all it was, I wouldn’t have minded but Lucy took it way too personally. She began to insult my body and weight, saying I ‘didn’t need burgers and should have stolen the salad instead’, and said she doesn’t blame me for stealing because I’m so poor and work a dead-end job. Lucy’s animosity didn’t stop for over a year, and she would always bring it up any chance she got.

I’m the one hosting this year and I have not invited John or Lucy. When they asked why they didn’t receive an invitation, I said ‘are you kidding?’ and hung up. Not the most mature, but I was so shocked at their audacity to ask.

My brother text me to suggest a sit down between myself and Lucy but I didn’t get the point of that since she will always think of me as a villain in this ridiculous story.

It was then that my brother confessed that he ate all the ‘missing’ food in the car and felt so embarrassed by it that he lied to Lucy about me refusing to give them the food. I was in awe. I knew he had lied but not the details or why he lied. I told him he’s a huge asshole here and he needs to come clean to Lucy now. I guess he did because Lucy then called me, apologising profusely. She said she had no reason to doubt my brother and she was already feeling left out and an outsider so she lashed out. I thanked her for her apology but said I didn’t forgive her- she said so many awful things to me over 2 missing plates of food.

I said they still weren’t invited to the gathering and that they are welcome to host their own (which I obviously wouldn't attend). This made my brother really mad (they were on speaker together).

A few hours later I got some texts from our mum telling me to just 'get over it' and invite Lucy and John. I just put my foot down and said if they show up, they won't be let in my home.

The whole situation was caused a rift in the family. Half are telling me I can't not include my brother and the other half are saying Lucy is a bitch for her comments. Lucy and John are still very mad.

72,1dpwxbo,AITA for Not Forgiving Our Friend After She Chose Her Boyfriend Over Us?," My friends and I (18F) planned a celebratory trip to a nearby town right after graduation. It was meant to be a final hangout before we all head off to different colleges. We were initially hesitant due to costs, but one of our parents generously offered to cover the expenses, so everyone agreed on the date.

However, the night before the trip, our friend (let's call her Emily) told us she couldn't join because of her cousin's birthday party. She did tell us this before our plan, but we assumed she'd come eventually now that we don't have to worry about money and she can attend next time. We tried to persuade her, reminding her that this might be our last chance to be together for a long time. Still, she insisted she couldn't make it.

The next day, while we were about to head home, we saw Emily at the mall with her boyfriend. It turns out she had ditched us for him. She didn't even tell us she was in the same town, because she told us the venue of the party was in another town. This wasn't the first time Emily had chosen her boyfriend over us; since she started dating him, he had become her entire world. We've been worried because he seemed controlling and manipulative, and we've even asked her to consider ending the relationship, but she always refused.

When we saw each other at the mall, she seemed shocked and terrified. That night, her boyfriend messaged us from her account, telling us to be more considerate of her feelings and claiming we never adjusted our plans for her. This was untrue, as we always accommodated Emily despite her frequent absences and lateness due to her boyfriend. We found out that the cousin’s party was nearby and she could have joined us after the morning event, knowing we have the entire day, but she didn't probably because of her boyfriend.

Emily and I were also supposed to apply for something in another city together, but she left without me due to miscommunication regarding the time. I understood but I also expected her to meet up with me, but that never happened and I found out she just spent the day with her boyfriend instead. After seeing her at the mall, I stopped responding to her messages, although some of our friends did. A week later, they broke up (probably realizing how toxic that man was) and rejoined the church community she had left for him.

Now, she's apologizing and trying to make amends, but we've mostly dismissed her and even created a new group chat without her. I feel guilty because I care about Emily and love my friend, but I struggle to trust her again after she repeatedly chose her boyfriend over us. AITA?

TL;DR:My friend Emily ditched our graduation trip for her boyfriend, lied about her reasons, and frequently chose him over us. Now that they broke up, she's trying to reconcile, but I'm struggling to forgive her and have excluded her from our group.

For the first couple of years, I would visit her during the summertime. The last time I visited her, she invited me to bring along my boyfriend, who she had not met. I was, for obvious reasons, really excited about this. Debb was living with her boyfriend (25 M), we’ll call him Ted, and had her first child, who was only about two years old. It was honestly a great visit. My sister expressed how much she liked my partner, and I felt that everything went pretty well. 

I should note that towards the end of our stay, there was some tension going on between my sister and her boyfriend. 

Two weeks after our visit, Debb told me what was going on between her and Ted. Ted previously had a past relationship where his partner cheated on him. He has serious trust issues. During our stay, Ted felt my sister was being a bit “too” nice to my boyfriend and that he “saw” my boyfriend check her out. This was a complete shock to me because I thought they got along quite well. My sister apologized and reassured me that she really liked my boyfriend and that we were good and it was just something that Ted needed to work on.

It was a semi-intimate ceremony with less than 50 people in attendance. Among those people was my father-in-law (who isn't even divorced from my husband's mom yet but that's another story for another time) and his new finacé, who I'll call Sarah. We have both known Sarah for about a year now and honestly thought that she was nice up until recently. She had been nice to me and we had talked about personal things to one another in an effort to build a relationship. She told me that she wouldn't mind if me and my husband didn't want her in the wedding photos and I told her I'd leave it up to him because this was his side of the family. My husband decided that it would be better just to have his own parents in the photos and leave Sarah out of them for this since it was such an important day in our lives. So, we did that, and I thought everything was fine. However, the day after our wedding, I opened Facebook and saw that she had posted something public on there about the wedding.

I was annoyed and asked her to at least apologize for messing up my room and invading my privacy, but she started berating me for apparently being disrespectful. Honestly, I think I’m just gonna clean it anyways, but I really want to know if i was being disrespectful or not.

Edit: Let me clear up some confusion. My mom and her friend were the ones taking the test. My mom was the one who messed up my room not the kids.",0.0,0.07963388413190842,0,1
79,1dpv0zo,AITA for making fun of my friend for enjoying history ,"I am posting this on a account I will delete later as I don't really use reddit, but I needed a second opinion.

I (14F) have been constantly shamed and shit on for posting about different things I have interests about (mainly video games and web series, stuff like that), wether it be posting gifs or talking about something that happens in that piece of media, they always shit on it. They also constantly poke fun at the fact that I may have autism, which could be true because I have all the symptoms, I just haven't been diagnosed. I don't really care about if I have autism or not but I don't like how they are framing it.

I say they cause it is a few people but it's mostly one person (14M) who we'll call Todd. Now Todd is also hyperfixated on something: history. Specifically Filipino history as he is, well, Filipino. Now that'd be all fine n good but he does the exact same stuff I do and get shamed for, except everyone doesn't care and let's him post. Which, again, wouldn't be a problem if they treated me with the same respect.

This has basically been going on for a year and it made me feel so shitty for liking the things I like. I had no one to talk to about this thing that made me really happy. It's not like I can really make new friends who are interested in what I like, since I have bad social anxiety. The only reason I'm in that group of friends is because one friend (14F) just dragged me in, I can't make friends by myself.


So one day I was talking about something in the group chat when the previous friend (14F) started making fun of Todd after he made fun of me about his interests. Me, of course happy that he's getting his fair share back, starts also teasing him. By the way, I want to make it clear it was very light teasing, not at all on the level he does to me. Apparently teasing him was cruel by everyone else's standards and started arguing with me. 

When I explained he had done the same exact thing to me for a year they told me ""just find more friends to talk with"" or ""yeah but history is more productive than what you like"". Todd also got really upset and when I explained to him this is what I've been dealing with for the past year he said (you don't have to run it in.."". He also changed all his profile to non history related stuff.

I and other friend also explained that the point of that was to treat both of us equally and to both be respected, but nobody seemed to understand that.

My friend is still in my side but a good amount of the gc is mad at me, AITA?

Edit: I realized I have left out vital information. I have told Todd multiple times that I am not comfortable with and id appreciate if he'd stop being rude to me for my interests, however he never listens nor does he care.
Also for examples of the teasing, he would tell me things like ""kys"" ""jump off a cliff"" ""stop fucking posting this shit"", I said stuff like ""dude you post this stuff at like 3 am"" ""it's basically the same as my interests, just a different flavor"", keep in mind it was mostly my other friend teasing.

80,1dpunzq,AITA for buying healthy food during my boyfriend's family's junk food weekend?,"
I 20f went on a weekend trip to a lake house with my boyfriend 20m and his family. This trip was their tradition, where they would relax, watch movies, and indulge in junk food all weekend.  

On the drive to the cabin we had stopped for the usual road trip junk and treats. When we arrived, I wasn't feeling well and could tell my body needed, healthy fresh food from all the junk I had eaten that day. However, because it was their usual tradition the only things available were chips, hotdogs, junk food, etc. I asked my boyfriend to take me to the nearest town, about 30 minutes away, so I could buy some vegetables, fruit and salad ingredients.

He agreed to take me but when we got inside the store he got really angry, saying I was making his family feel bad and trying to show off by eating healthy food while everyone else had junk food. He tried to convince me to put it back and not get it, he caused a scene at the register and people were looking. I felt so bad I put my head down and was really embarrassed. I still got some stuff but I basically ate it in secret over the weekend so no one saw me. The family just seemed quite not saying much to me and my boyfriend continued to scold me when we got back to the cabin.

My entire family is very close and my mom loved her grand babies. Sadly she was only able to see my daughter (2f) a couple times before she passed. 

My husband(26m) and I decided to name our daughter after my mom. Except we swapped my mom’s middle and first name for our daughter. (Ex: my moms name was Jane Doe our daughters name is Doe Jane)

Recently my SIL(32f) announced she and my brother Jake (30m) are expecting their fourth child and it’s a girl. While at a family dinner my SIL also announced they planned to name the baby Doe Jane after my mom. 

I became upset and pointed out my daughter was already named Doe Jane and my SIL asked why there couldn’t be two Doe Jane’s in honor of my mom. 

This lead to a full blown argument. Where SIL and my brother stormed out after. 

Now my brother Jake, SIL, and other brother expect me to apologize for monopolizing a name and embarrassing my SIL. They said I can’t own a name and SIL can name her baby whatever she wants. 

My husband and twin agree with me that it’s weird to have two kids with the same name. And that it’s unfair to my daughter. 

My dad and other siblings do agree with me but think I went about it in an asshole way.

They want to visit to meet our 2.5 yo toddler and lives \~3 hrs away. Unfortunately, her husband is a chain smoker.

84,1dpt5yd,AITA For Refusing To Wear My Friend’s Old Wedding Dress From Her First Wedding To Her Second One?,"My (32F) friend (32F) from college is getting married later this year. The save the date sent last year didn’t mention where the wedding would be. My friend and I live in neighboring states. However, when my husband (33M) and I were sent the wedding invitations three weeks ago, it turned out that it was going to be a destination wedding. After looking into it, it would cost over $4000 for the both of us.

My husband and I can’t afford to spend that much money without going into credit card debt. So last week, I told my friend on the phone that we couldn’t attend but conveyed our best wishes and said that we would send them a wedding gift off the registry. She asked me why we couldn’t come and I said that it wasn’t in our budget, mentioning the costs of plane tickets, the resort (3 nights), and wedding outfits.

She offered to lend me a dress to wear so I wouldn’t have to spend money to buy one. I told her that it was really kind of her to offer but the main costs for attending her wedding were the plane tickets and the resort. Then, she followed up by offering for me to wear her old wedding dress from her first wedding. And she added that she didn’t care about other people wearing white to her wedding. 

Context: My friend got married in 2017 and divorced in 2020. My then-boyfriend (now husband) and I attended that wedding and it was held locally. The wedding dress she wore was beautiful and minimalist/simple in design. I don’t have any details into their divorce though I do know that it was not amicable.

I was pretty shocked by her offer, I didn’t (and still don’t) understand the logic behind it. I basically repeated what I said in respond to her first offer to loan me a dress. She got a bit upset at my rejection and said that she was trying to do everything she could to help us attend. Again, I thanked her for being so generous with her offers to help but at this point, I was trying to end the phone call as quickly as possible.

Tbh there’s something very off-putting to me about the idea of wearing the bride’s wedding dress from her previous wedding to her current one. And a lot of people who attended her first wedding will be at this one so I think at least some will recognize the dress. I would just feel so embarrassed the entire time. So even if we could afford to go to the wedding, I would have turned down this offer anyways. But I didn’t tell my friend any of this on the phone.

Just yesterday, my friend sent me a long text which basically said that she thought my husband and I were being inconsiderate and ungrateful and that we should have made a bigger effort to attend her wedding considering we had been friends for almost 15 years. And that clearly I didn’t value our friendship as much as she did. I haven’t responded to this message yet and I’ve only discussed the situation with my husband who is on my side.

We have 6 people in our department, and we have to frequently travel across the state as our work involves overseeing government projects. We always travel in a group of two. Although my travel partner changes based on the project, Mary and I are generally put on similar projects and enjoy each other's company. My wife also likes Mary. Overall, we have a very healthy work relationship.

On to the incident. Yesterday, we had a happy hour in our office, and we were all drinking after work hours and chatting. It was a group of around 10 people that stayed back. Mary was blabbering about how we both have been travelling together so much in the last year. She was roasting me for my habits while travelling like always forgetting stuff in my hotel room, being sweaty and stinky when I join her for breakfast in mornings (because I go to hotel gym). Everyone was laughing and she was making it sound how unbearable I was to tag along (all in good fun). I also told some funny and sweet stories about her and agreed with her saying that I can be difficult to be with sometimes.

Mary came to me and hugged me tightly and told me that she loves me, and I am her work-husband.

So, to diffuse the situation, I took her hands off my shoulder and told her, she was my work-sister and that is why I love to annoy her so much.

That seemed to have upset Mary and she left and went back to her desk and was sobbing silently. I tried to apologize to her, but she told me how embarrassing the whole situation was.

To me, the hotel doesn’t matter so much unless it’s a resort or something where we’ll be spending a lot of time there.

88,1dpsw0f,WIBTA if I didn’t get my brother a birthday present,"In april I (F) had my 19th birthday. My mother gave me 3 gifts that she bought off Temu. She told me she was lazy and didn’t want to wrap anything. My brother (22) didn’t get me anything and neither did my father (he’s 74 and has never gotten us presents). 

I told my mother I was thankful and I appreciated everything, especially the mini music box which is really cute (it’s smaller than my palm so i put it in my purse), but I was a bit upset that my brother hadn’t gotten me anything because I get him something every year plus holidays. However, this is the first time he didn’t get me something, so I tried not to take it personally.

About 3/4ths through the day (like 3-4 pm), my mother and brother went to the store and bought a cake and a box of strawberries. That was really the best part of it. My best friend sent me money as she was still working on her gift (it’s handmade). I asked my mother if we had any plans and she said if we went out, I’d have to spend my birthday money for it. She wasn’t willing to spend her own money to take me for ice cream or dinner. She told me she had already spoken to my brother and he wouldn’t be upset if we didn’t go out, so it was up to me. I didn’t want to spend it, so we didn’t go out. 

The next day, my mother pulled me into the kitchen and told me a few months prior she had ordered some clothes for my brother and was wondering if she should give them to him now or wait for his birthday (July). I told her you may not be able to return them 3 months later, so she should give them to him. I had  no problems with that. What I didn’t expect was 7 bags of clothes. 

He was like a kid at Christmas. Excited for everything and trying everything on. When I saw how much he got, I’ll admit that it actually hurt my feelings as silly as it sounds. 

In the middle of him opening everything, my mother turned to me and apologized that she couldn’t get me more. My brother said I didn’t need more because I have “everything BTS”.

As he was trying everything on, he started asking for more clothes and my mother told him “yeah, we can do that” and “yeah, I’ll look for it for you”. I stayed quiet the entire time.

Before he had gotten all of this, I was looking at custom made card decks (he’s heavily into card magic and presidents, so I began working on a custom deck and intended to use my birthday money for his birthday. He also has, I’m not exaggerating, 50+ decks). After he opened and tried everything, later in the day I texted my mother asking if he had a specific deck to which she said yes. I told her I had intended on making him a deck for his birthday, but I was a bit hurt that he didn’t get me anything. She told me I can’t be upset with him because he didn’t know what to get me, and then followed by saying “actually, he picked out the cake”. 

It’s been months and I’m still upset. I’m mostly upset because my birthday’s as of the last few years have been ruined.

I am not great, but have a nice camera body and have been taking photos consistently for about 4 years.  My main focus is my dog, but I am also a hobby birder and really love attempting to capture birds and animals especially.  My boyfriend (32M) technically purchased the camera body for us as a couple to use.  I did not pay for the camera body at all. It was a significant purchase, but it was several years ago and he makes a lot of money at his job.  Despite the purchase, he has never once independently used the camera.  He seemingly has no interest in photography.  He never has any issue with my use of the camera and typically supports my photography. 

Except when we are on very nice vacations.  For example, last year we were on a bird tour in Canada and I was super excited to photograph Puffins.  On the tour, out of nowhere, he demanded to use the camera. I was really upset but figured I should let him try since it is technically his camera.  Of course, he doesn't ever use a camera or have experience so he didn't know what he was doing and didn't get any good photos.  I tried to ask for it back because I was so excited, and we got in a fight. He wanted to keep trying to take photos and ended up using the camera during really special once in a lifetime moments like when an eagle flew by extremely close to us. 

Fast forward to present.  We are going on a big safari trip in August.  In an attempt to prevent another fight, I brought up this issue preemptively.  I said since I am the primary photographer and I am the one renting a very expensive telephoto lens for the trip, I should be the one taking photos.

I ended up pregnant around the same time as my husband’s ex/Callie’s mom, Sandra. She gave birth 2 months after me. We didn’t talk much about it. My husband and I did talk to Callie about the baby. We read her books about it, assured her that she’ll always be our family, we love her, etc. This baby is an addition to our family, not replacing her in anyway. I know Sandra and her husband had a similar talk. We validated Callie’s feelings on the subject.

Anyway, I had a baby shower and Callie was there. She also went to her mother’s. Sandra’s was after mine.

Then Sandra had her daughter. SIL bought her a bear for Callie to give. Sandra and her husband had a ton of gifts for Callie to celebrate her becoming a big sister. Again, very sweet, didn’t think much of it.

The situation has stressed my husband, who called his father pathetic for yelling at him for not having us help out more. 

Lizzy called me again, saying she is going on vacation and desperately needs me to help with the meal train for her father while she is gone. I told her to buy him a cookbook and show him how to turn on the stove. Lizzy called me a bitch, saying Paul is a traditionalist and has never cooked for himself. I told Lizzy this would be an excellent time for Paul to learn to be a big boy. My husband took the phone from my hand and hung up on his sister. 

Lizzy took to Facebook (another family member showed me this) and complained about how awful some people treated their elders.

94,1dps7ju,AITA for confronting a neighbour about her friend about parking in forn of out driveway?,"Our next door neighbour is an older women who does not own a car, but approximately twice a week her friend comes round to visit her and almost always parks her car on the street blocking our driveway. Our neighbour actually has her own driveway but this is used by her next door neighbour on the other side. I've never asked why but I guess they've come to an arrangement. To be clear, there is some parking available on the street. If our neighbour's friends would drive about 3 feet forward she would not be blocking us in. There is no good reason for her not to do this.

We have asked her friend no to do this before, once in person and once in person and once with a note left on the car (which we saw her read). Many more times we have not said anything since we didn't need to go anywhere at that moment in time. However my partner is a social worker who is in and out multiple times a day to do home visits so it is in constant use.

Today my partner came home and discovered she couldn't park on our driveway since it is blocked with this woman's car. She probably could have found a space on the street but since this has been annoying us for months I knocked on our neighbours door and asked if her friend to move her car. She was apologetic and moved it forward so that my partner could get in. On her way in I told her, admittedly with some anger in my voice but definitely not raised or shouting, that if she did this again we would take a picture of it and report it to our local council as we have asked her about this before and it keeps happening (local government, they are responsible for parking enforcement and this is what all advice online states to do). 

Our neighbour then comes back with her friend and she was LIVID. We have always been friendly with her before but we argued for probably 3 or 4 minutes. The following points had made her angry

1. Her friend had already apologised (this is true, but then she did it again)

2. This was the first time it had happened (this is false, although our neighbour didn't necessarily know about it. We were very clear during our argument that we have asked her before not to do it)

3. Her friend is going through a lot and we have no idea.

4. We were not being neighbourly. We didn't understand that everyone on this street gets along. That this kind of attitude is everything that's wrong with the world. She made that point that she has lived here 20 years and we have only lived here about 18 months. (In my view parking in front of someone else's parking space is not neighbourly since its widely understood to be anti-social behaviour)

Married for 3 and we have two kids. Since the beginning he has know about my older brother who is disabled (cerebral palsy, quadriplegic) and about my elderly mother. I am the youngest of 4. I have always been clear that there will be a time when I will have to care for them both. My two older brothers will also take on the responsibility. We will each care for them a few months out of the year so they are not a burden on any one of us. Well, that time is approaching, my mom recently had a conversation with us 3 siblings about how she will need to start getting the help from us permanently as she is getting too old to take care of my brother on her own. She is 74yo and currently live in our home country where she does have help from one of my cousins who lives with her. He is the one that mainly takes care of my mom. Now, the issue arises that since we will need to start taking care of them on a more permanent basis, my husband does not want to have them in our home for months at a time. He and my mom have had their issues in the past but he does recognize that she has helped us a lot with the girls. My mom took care of my oldest and did not have to take her to daycare nor pay for it as she would never charge us for watching her grandbaby. He feels that we would lose our privacy and that my mom would nags us. Now, my siblings and I do not want to put her and brother in a nursing home or anything like that. So AITAH for telling my husband that if he didn’t like it then he would have to leave? I do recognize that I said that in the heat of the moment as this is not new to him. He has always known that at some point I would be caring for them. I even told him this before we decided to get married and he was on board. 
Edit: wow! So many responses, this is my first time posting. I’ve been busy with work so just getting to see all the comments. I’ll try to address as many questions as possible. My mom and hubby get along fine. She does not mistreat him or anything like that. She actually caters to him, especially when it comes to food. Always makes sure I feed him…lol In the Latino culture, that’s how it is, make sure your man is fed! My mom and bro are both US citizens so there is no issues with them traveling back and forth. Also, the plan my brothers and I HAD was for a few years down the road. As of right now my mom is still healthy and strong enough to be able to travel. Back home she has someone who helps take care of my brother. Financially we are all stable and she has a good pension so they would not be a financial burden on any of us. We all live in the same hometown so we can all contribute to the care regardless of where mom/bro is staying. It would be very detrimental to my brother’s health if we put him in an assisted living facility. He is very emotionally attached to us and our family. I really appreciate everyone’s comments as they have opened my eyes to a future reality that I had not foreseen. Who were we kidding! I do believe the in-law suite option is great and one that my hubby and I have considered as well. I will say that hubby and I are fine and words were said in the heat of the moment. We will talk further and will have to come up with a better plan, especially have backup plans. This is not a fake story, just don’t have all the time in the world to reply back to all the questions and read all the comments. Brothers do have significant others but no kids yet. Their SO are on board with taking care of mom/bro as this has always been a part of our family plan. We have always known that when my mom is no longer able to care for brother we will step in. This was not expected of us but rather a decision that we made and something that we are up front about when entering a serious relationship.

96,1dprqen,AITA: For not prioritising friends and family while living as an expat?,"As an expat, living away from home, my holiday allowance every year is centred around seeing friends and family. I've been happy to try my best to see as many friends and family members each time I have some time off and travel home, but it is starting to get out of hand. 

Initially, people were very understanding if I was visiting but couldn't fit them in, but these days these visits home have become something I dread planning. Certain friends and family members are so outranged and insulted if I am unable to find time to see them, and funnily enough, these people will be the ones who do not want to take any time off work themselves and wont ever visit me in my current country. My time off work becomes somewhat of a big guilt trip, and I end up feeling knackered coming back to work after a week of travelling to all different areas to see people. However, no one is grateful for this, its simply become the expectation of me now. 

Historically I've never pleased myself, I may want to spend my annual leave doing other things like spending time in other countries as a tourist, or having more of a chilled time when visiting home and having a few days to myself, resting and enjoying the countryside and my hobbies etc, or god forbid having a holiday where it's just me and my husband. But now I'm starting to think, if I always upset someone no matter how hard I try, perhaps I suit myself from now on and make it their problem if they cant fit me into their schedule when I visit, rather than the responsibility always being on me. 

I would for sure lose some long term friendships if I didn't go out of my way to see them every time I'm at home, for example, a friend who never bothered to get back to me to confirm plans over a month ago has sent me a message describing how upset and disappointed she is with me due to me now (trip planned for next week) having no time to see her. Had she of responded to me initially I would have factored her into my plans, but no one views it that way which makes me feel resentful. 

When I try to flip it around perhaps I am an asshole since I am the one who has moved away, and it should be my responsibility to maintain friendships and relationships with family members. At the end of the day they just want to see me, which is not the worst problem to have - but it is draining and stressful trying to make it work.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-27,"AITA: For not prioritising friends and family while living as an expat?

Now this cousin has come back around April 28th. My boyfriend had an apartment that he was going to sublease for the summer but instead let his cousin have it, PAID HIS FIRST MONTHS RENT, and now on top of his cousin not putting in any effort to looking for a job, he also decided to not pay the next months rent which resulted in him obviously now not having that apartment. Now, this cousin is here every single day from start to finish and this past week(which is when I found out about him losing the apartment) he has stayed the night four nights in a row.

Now something like that I understand being a little shook up especially being as we were not sober, but I still felt some type of way because he didn’t mention to me that he was staying he just barged in the room with a blanket and pillow. I love my boyfriend so much but he seems to not consider my feelings or peace. It’s like im supposed to just suck it up because I’m the girlfriend and stuff like this is expected and that does not work for me.

99,1dpr1bt,AITA for valuing my alone time every week?,"Okay so me and my husband have been staying with my husband's parents for a few months now to save up and buy a house. Me, him, and his mom all work from home which is already chaotic within itself. 

I'm the only one in the house who has a option to work four 10 hour shifts to have every Friday off which I usually end up doing. But like clockwork, my sister in law always comes over on Fridays with her baby and it’s usually last minute/unannounced. That wouldn't be the issue because I love kids but her baby screams excessively to the point where it even annoys my mother in law and husband while they’re always on work calls.

I feel like she expects me to hang out with her and watch her kid when she’s here and I'm usually nice enough where I don't say anything and just do it but it takes up my time where I could be doing other things. There have been several times where I’ve had no choice but to watch the kid because she drops the kid off after my mother in law agrees to it without telling me and since my mother in law is working I’m the one who has to watch the baby. 

Recently she complained to my mother in law that I haven't reached out to her enough. I had to nicely tell my mother in law that I choose to have Fridays off to get my life in order - do laundry, cook, clean around the house, it's just my ""me"" time while everyone else works.

Also forgot to mention that I don't really have the best relationship with my sister in law.

I’ve been trying to move past it but sometimes she makes this remarks that come off as rude and it offends me and I feel like we’re back to square one.

100,1dpqi6y,WIBTA for moving out of my mom’s house when she is going through a lot in her life? ,"I (23F) live with my mother (58F) at her house in our suburban town. I graduated college 6 months ago, but spent my last semester living at home taking online classes. So I’ve been living with her for 1 year.

For some context, I have 3 younger siblings (21F, 19M and 17M). I am the most responsible by far. My siblings are kind of jerks who don’t care about my mom and take advantage of her. 
My mom also has a partner of 10 years who lives in our neighborhood.

My best friend asked me to move in with her into her apartment in the city which is an hour away from my mom’s place. This would significantly improve my commute to work. I currently have to commute 2 HOURS each way to work, 3 days a week because the traffic is so bad. If I moved into my friends apartment, the commute would be 45 minutes on public transportation so no traffic, no filling up my gas constantly, no putting crazy miles on my car. 

I am MISERABLE living at home. I love my mother and it’s not her who’s the problem. But being 23 in a tiny town sucks and my commute is beyond draining. It’s great not paying rent and saving money, but this is just not worth it.


I feel kind of guilty because my mom is going through a lot. Her relationship with her boyfriend is falling apart, she has a lot of financial stress, and she’s just generally stressed and depressed. I love my mother and I wish I could help her, but at the end of the day I need to live my own life. I’m 23 and living in a small town with no social life whatsoever. Everyone I know lives in the city and I’d be within 25 minutes of all of my friends if I moved into the city with my friend.

My mom’s boyfriend has other opinions. He told me I would be selfish to leave my mom because she “needs me.” I told him that he is her partner and it should be his job to keep her not lonely. I’m her daughter, not her boyfriend. I don’t think it’s my responsibility to stay at home just so that my mother isn’t lonely. I’m sorry she’s going through it with life, but this is my life. I need to do what’s best for me. 

I’m really upset because I’m starting to wonder  if I’m a selfish brat for moving out. I feel really bad. But I don’t think it’s fair for me to live at home for an undetermined amount of time. 

TLDR; Moms boyfriend said I’m selfish to move out of my mom’s house to a location that would greatly improve my quality of life because my mom is lonely.

104,1dppyxi,AITA for asking my husband for quality time? ,"My husband (28M) and I (25F) have been married for nearly two years. We have an almost 8-month-old daughter. He is self-employed with off days on Friday and Sunday. On workdays, he gets home at 9 or 10 PM, eats, showers, and sleeps. On his days off, he wakes up at 7 AM, watches some YouTube videos, and by 10 AM, he leaves to chill with his friends, returning around 10 PM. 

Meanwhile, I take care of the baby and handle all chores, including handwashing laundry. By the time he comes home, I’m too exhausted to think straight. I’ve asked him numerous times to spend one day a week for us to bond, but he ignores my pleas. He often eats breakfast in his car to avoid being late to see his friends.

Whenever I bring up the issue, he accuses me of not appreciating his efforts for the family. I affirm him daily, even when he brings small things like a lollipop. Being unemployed, I try to appreciate him by cooking his favorite meals. Even if he gets off work early in between the week he drops his tools and leaves to see his friends. 

Because of recent protests in Kenya, he came home early but left shortly after. Despite my hopes for some rest due to my cramps and ulcer pain, he drove off to his friends. I told him I wouldn’t accept a miserable marriage and that he’s pushing me away. He told me to do what I want.

As a C-section mom, he never spent a full day with me. When I was too sick to hold our baby, he stayed with his friends despite my pleas for help. I’ve tried to enjoy our marriage but have grown bitter. I’m mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted. My feelings for him are fading, and I avoid sex because I don’t enjoy it and often fake it.

His mother advised me to appreciate his financial support and isn't violent but it feels like he wants me to worship him for paying rent and buying groceries and diapers. Returning home isn’t an option because my dad doesn’t want a divorced child in his house. 

I suspect my husband might be seeing someone else and pushing me away to make it look like I chose to leave. He doesn’t eat my meals when he comes back from seeing his “friends.” My mental health is suffering, and despite applying for jobs, I haven’t received any responses. It feels like God is silent.

My (26M) wedding is coming up in a few months, and I’ve been busy with all the planning. One of the issues I’ve run into is my sister (28F) and her dog. My sister is obsessed with her dog, a large and somewhat poorly trained Bernese Mountain dog. (cute but a demon)She takes it everywhere with her, including family gatherings, despite the fact that many of us have asked her not to.

For context, her dog has caused a lot of problems in the past. At my cousin’s wedding, her dog knocked over an elderly guest and tore up some of the decorations. At our family’s holiday dinner last year, it ate part of the turkey off the table when no one was looking. My sister always brushes it off, saying her dog is just energetic and friendly.

When I sent out my wedding invitations, I decided not to invite her dog. I know she will bring it anyway if I just ask her not to, so I told her that she can’t bring the dog and that if she does, she won’t be allowed in. My sister was furious and said that if her dog isn’t welcome, she isn’t coming either. She accused me of not caring about her happiness and making her choose between her family and her dog.

My parents think I should just let her bring the dog to keep the peace, but my fiancé and I are firm on this. We want our wedding to be a calm and beautiful day without any chaos. I’ve tried to compromise by suggesting she find a pet sitter for the day, but she refused and insists that her dog is part of the family.

About 3 hours after that, she came next to me and said ""I don't want you to turn that kinda of people"", and I was trying to understand what she wanted to say, because she was really furious. I said, kindly, ""What kinda of people?"". Now, I wish I didn't said that, because she went to my room, picked up my two volumes of the especial edition, and she threw them in the trash.

111,1dppdau,WIBTA to take a bigger room despite being the only single person ,"So I (M39) am turning 40 in about a month 

I have a friendship group made up of 4 friends (mixed, 39) and am also friends with their partners 

To celebrate turning 40 I have booked an lake house for us to spend the weekend a couple hours away. 

There are 4 couples coming plus myself obviously 

The house has 5 bedrooms, 4 doubles with en-suites and one with two single beds without an en-suite. 

The rooming situation came up recently with one of my friends and he was expecting me to take the room with the single beds and was surprised when I said I intended to take one of the bigger rooms. 

I get his pov- I'm the only single so I don't really need a double bed and the couples would obviously like to sleep together 

My pov is it's my birthday, I'm paying for the whole thing so I should get first pick of rooms. Besides it's two nights, is it a big deal for one couple to sleep in separate rate beds (in the same room) just for a weekend 

We didn't really reach a resolution, I know he thinks I'm being an AH about it and should just take the smaller room. I'm a bit worried to bring it up to the rest of the group in case they feel the same, I don't want it to put a dampener on the weekend but equally I think I should get one of the nicer rooms.

112,1dpovyy,AITA for telling my best friend to stop dumping on me about her relationship ,"I (23f) and my best friend (22f) have been friend for 8 years now, we shall call her “Tiffany”, about a year ago Tiffany started dating this man(35) she works with, we will call him Dick (it’s fitting trust me). 
So she starts seeing Dick, and EVERYONE that knows this man told her he was bad news (in and out of prison, drugs, doesn’t own ANYTHING and uses everything in her name house car etc) I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt because I want good things for Tiffany and I was truly hoping this guy would be good to her. But since this relationship has started I have gotten call after call after call and text after text SOLELY about something he’s done that’s made her upset, it’s gotten to the point that almost the ONLY reason she texts or calls me anymore. 

The crap calls started with Dick almost REFUSING to do small thing like just cuddle her, lay in the same bed as her, give her any non sexual attention, but recently they have progressed into him CALLING HER OUT in front of their peers about their sex life that she had spoken to him about, and tried to make mends with, her catching him texting other women and clearly being able to see there are texts deleted, him yelling at her because he got her the WRONG FREAKIN DRINK, and her finding text messages where he was trying to coerce her into sexual acts with other people. 
There’s soooooo much more I could add to this but the post would be longer than the history of the world, I swear. 

I have ALWAYS been there to listen to her, and to give her what advice I could, which recently has been to just leave him. I’ve offered help with saving money, gradually packing her things, and even having law enforcement or even just my own dad there IF need be. But of course he “cries” and straightens up for a few days when she threatens to leave because he literally needs her. I know she needs me in these times because they are hard! I’ve been there! 
But it’s getting to the point that it’s the only time I hear from her, the only time she texts me or calls me, and it’s getting emotionally draining. 
I don’t like seeing her upset or hearing her cry, she’s like a sister to me. 
But there’s only so much of the SAME shit I can handle. 
So the other day I basically told her that I will always be here for her if she truly needs me, but her constantly and only texting me about Dick is getting to be too much, and that I’ve offered her all the advice I can give and all the help I have. 
She was understanding because she gave me that same talk in an old relationship of mine that was similar but not as severe.

We have been using, (lets call her A) A's pans to cook. Now normally this shouldn't be a issue at anyones house, but apparently she has been getting upset at me because I would not wash the pans directly after using them. Ok quick fix, I started washing them whenever I was done cooking. So here's the issue now. I had cooked dinner last night and at the same time A had started cooking as well. She was using the entire kitchen sink to prepare her food(washing meat) so I was unable to clean the pan. It took her forever to cook her food, and I eventually fell asleep before I was able to wash the pan and my plate. I wake up this morning to find that A has now decided to take all pots, pans, plates and cups and hide them from us, leaving us without anything to cook with. My dad had asked her why, and her reasoning was because she was upset that I would have 1 cup in my room that I consistently drink water out of all day and night and because I did not wash the pan out while she was in the sink. My dad eventually told me it was my fault because I did not wash the pan and plate, but I was unable to due to her cooking her own food and using the sink. I was literally unable to cook any food for the day and eventually had to ask friends for money for food. I honestly feel disrespected, but also feel like I did something wrong. AITA?
Ps She also has multiple cups and I drink water constantly. It has also been really hot in my area so my water intake has been above average.

He works around 8 hours a day in construction while I’m a SAHM. We each have our own “jobs” and so far it’s been working 85% of the time. We decided early in the pregnancy that this was the plan because of how expensive and nerve-wracking childcare can be. But like all first time parents, we’d had no idea what to expect with a baby and how postpartum would affect me. 
Our son is 3 weeks old and has a pretty good schedule at the moment. He wakes up every 3ish hours for a bottle and diaper change, and my body is finally adjusting so I’m handling it well-until a surprise “rough night” happens. This is when our baby is more fussy than usual and scream-cries, fights sleep, eats WAY more than normal, and just rebels against his usual routine. This is when my postpartum anger sets in. I get so angry because I’m tired, can’t figure out what the baby needs from me, and I’m going through the motions. Meanwhile, my partner sleeps through EVERYTHING. I wake him up numerous times saying “please tag me out”, “I’m getting too angry to think straight”, “I need help, I don’t know what’s wrong”, and he wakes for a second but goes back to sleep. 
However, the last bad night we had I lost it and yelled at my partner. I was so angry I couldn’t think and my partner wouldn’t wake up to help so I yelled at him and woke him up out of a dead sleep. I instantly regretted it because he looked frightened and after I said “I’ve been asking you for help and you won’t. I can’t do this, I’m tagging out.” He got angry. He called me a rude-ass for yelling at him, said “I’ll just get up then” with an attitude, and yelled at me because I went to go cry in the bathroom saying “oh god, don’t be like that.” 
I’m not asking a lot, just help on the bad nights and the moments that I need to tag out for safety. However, I feel guilty I got angry with him.

116,1dpn7ma,AITA for not taking the time to talk to my mother?,"I (26F) have a very fractured relationship with my mother (53). It's been very difficult and I honestly don't have much time for her these days.

When I gave birth to my daughter, my mother was there to 'help' me, but was constantly overstepping boundaries and acting like a mother, rather than a grandmother, and it felt like she was projecting. She would make appointments without telling me and dictate who my daughter could and couldn't see, would make me go out to run errands rather than be at home with my child. Her justification was that, because she was my mother, I had to listen to her, and her decisions ruled the house.
(Background Info: I was living with my older sister at the time and just before I gave birth, they moved all my belongings to my mother's place and so I was there with my mother and younger siblings (23F). The day right after, I gave birth and didn't get a chance to find my own place because I was basically blocked from doing anything outside of being a parent and doing household errands, like groceries and laundry and such).

It all boiled over when I was 23 (it was 2021 amidst COVID lockdowns). 

I decided I had enough, and my friends help me leave the house with my daughter. I didn't tell my mother, since I was 23 and had the right to leave, and so she called the police on me when she saw me loading my car and packing mine and my daughter's things. 

Police let us go because my daughter wasn't in any danger, nor could they really stop me taking my own daughter elsewhere. A month later, I get a call from a lawyer saying that my kid was going to be taken away and there was nothing I could do at that point. Turned out, my mother went to court and got an order to have my child taken from me - it was full of 'I think' and 'I believe' about me, but no actual evidence, and they deemed it enough to just take my 3 year old away. (Unsure how much detail I can go into with her accusations). 

Spent a solid 2 years trying to get full custody of my child back (which I mostly have now - she goes with her grandmother each fortnight and a week of school holidays) but my mother is adamant that she was doing me a favour, and that she was completely in the right, and will talk to me as if nothing is wrong. 

Now, my mother is always sending messages and acting as if she didn't take 2 years of my daughter's youth and 2 years of time with my child away, and is always telling me about her problems, and I just ignore it 95% of the time. I don't have time for it and I just don't think I will ever actually forgive her for what she took and what she did. The contact I make is mostly to do with pick ups and drop offs of my daughter, with an occasional explanation of sickness etc. Other than that, it's radio silence.

Girlfriend (34F) and I (29M) recently had (or are having) an argument regarding our families involvement in the relationship. For some back story, i live with my mother since we have been on and off in recent months/ years, she lives in her own home with her daughter and is visited by her mother (who she despises) daily, bringing her shopping, doing her washing, child care etc. 
Two or three days ago I was there and with her daughter we made lasagne for us 3 to eat. We had extras so we made single serving lasanges to freeze and reheat, I asked to take one home with me after and no problems at the dinner table. Then before I left her mother arrived to the home, much to my girlfriend's disapproval and we both made jokes about her being there but not being welcome. 
Fast forward 2 hrs, I have left her home and taken one of the prepared lasagna with me to my mother's home and had a text from my partner saying  ""So who's getting the lasagne then. The bitch who blocked me or the bastard who blanked me? 🙃"" referring to my mother and brother respectively. At first I tried to ignore this comment as it was mixed in with niceties about how happy her and her daughter were that I am back in their lives.

118,1dpmfhq,AITA For not hiring a French tutor for my daughter due to her giving up on learning other languages in the past?,"My daughter ‘Maria’ (13 y.o.) wants to learn French and recently asked me and my wife if she could start having formal lessons.

Something to know is that my daughter goes through phases of wanting to learn languages, loses interest, and gives up on them. She’s gone through Spanish, German, Hawaiian, and Chinese which she spent the longest learning. But even with that one, she seemed really motivated at first but gave up after a few months.

I tried to look at the prices for French tutors on reliable sites, but their rates are all pretty high and money is unfortunately tight for us right now. I told my daughter that there were free online resources she could use to get a head start. My daughter starts high school next year. If she does follow through with wanting to learn French, she can take it there and her school’s honors society will offer free tutoring.

My wife is now saying we should hire a tutor for our daughter because it’s a good thing to encourage and having a one-on-one tutor will probably help to motivate her. She’s made further arguments that second language will be required at our daughter’s high school, and if she already knows French then she can focus on her other classes or potentially earn a scholarship.

I can see my wife’s arguments. But as I mentioned above, money is tight and I still don’t want to spend the money on French lessons when my daughter has shown thus far that she isn’t going to follow through with it.

119,1dpmbof,AITA for staying at a friends house,"I live in the UK and when I was at university I lived with the same group of people for 3 years. There were 4 guys and 3 girls. We all became very close friends and have kept in touch but due to me living in a different part of the country to most of them, we haven't all met up in years. 

One of them suggested we all meet up this summer for a weekend to catch up and we all agreed. As I live in the north of England and everyone else lives in or around London, we agreed London would be the most convenient place to meet. 

Public transport is expensive in the UK especially if you're travelling to London and hotel prices can be even worse. One of the girls I lived with offered me her spare room so I could save money on hotels and I accepted.

 She's in a relationship with one of the guys we lived with so there's a good chance he'll also be there. I was talking to my girlfriend about my plans and she got annoyed when I told her where I would be staying. 

She said I shouldn't be staying at a woman's house and that I should be getting a hotel. I showed her the hotel prices and just pointed out they were far too expensive when I have somewhere to stay for free. 

My gf still repeated that I should get a hotel. I just said unless she was going to pay for the hotel, I'd be staying at my friends house. She just said I was being disrespectful and should be listening to her.

I'm sorry for the formatting. I need to vent, and I'm on mobile. But this has been eating at me for a while. Also, sorry if this is the incorrect place for this, as I'm a first-time poster. A little bit of background: I (20 f) have always been the “golden” child in my parents' eyes, as I’m the only one of my siblings to graduate high school and start pursuing a college degree. So, I'm constantly told that I'm responsible for uplifting my elders and passing down gratitude and love. For the sake of this post, I will also note that I live in a separate state from everyone mentioned here and couldn't attend the event in person on my days off. I also pay a large shared phone bill regularly, equal to 1/2 of my monthly paycheck (part-time worker), including every one mentioned in this story, with no one offering to pay their part regularly. 

Recently, my nephew Dare (6) celebrated his birthday with my mother (61 f), stepdad (somewhere in his 50s m), sister’s fiance (somewhere in their 30’s nb), and sister ( 32 f). Before Dare’s birthday, I asked my sister what Dare wanted for his birthday. I was told that as she’d recently lost her job (to my knowledge, she's still currently unemployed) and that the most meaningful gift I could give was to purchase the uniform he needed for his new school (upwards of 100 dollars), and I agreed.

 Today, I finally had the free time from work to look at my sister's Facebook page and discovered the video she’d posted about her son Dare’s birthday. At the end of it, she unveiled a final large gift from her and her partner: a hoverboard. And it's making me reevaluate my relationship with my sister and family. I’m glad that my nephew is getting new items that he'll hopefully cherish, but on the other hand, if my sister/her fiance had the money for a fancy new gadget, why did they ask that I pay for a necessity for my sister’s child? 

When I'm making minimum wage, and I'm saving up for my next semester of college. I splurged to get what I thought was necessary for Dare’s education. Only to discover that they could have paid for it all along, and I could have bought my nephew a less expensive gift and continued to save for my future. Here is where I may be TA.

 I brought my feelings up to my mom, who said that I was selfish for wanting to spend less on my nephew’s birthday and that I didn't know what they may have had to sacrifice to get such a gift. This situation is starting to make me feel that I’m drowning in the weight of being reliable to a fault that I'd pay for a necessity so my sister/family can buy fun gifts without remorse. But I also feel so guilty for being upset over something others consider petty.  So Reddit, wibtah, if I stopped being so responsible and let them figure out how to pay the bills/ emotional labor I’m shouldering?

We've all got young children, and live about 30 minutes away. Everyone can drive, so imo 30 minutes isn't really a big deal. It would take me 20 minutes just to drive across the town, and it's only a 15 minutes drive to meet halfway at a playground 🤷

I just feel like if they can't even make the effort to ever say ""hey, I know we're both free Sunday, why don't we go to the park, or watch a movie with the kids?"" or something.

125,1dplgzv,WIBTA is I refused to support/ share the word about my brother's Kickstarter because he used AI generated images as a part of it?,"Quick background info: My brother, who is 6 years older than me, went to school for game design and has, at this point, made a few successful table top games that I've always previously supported. He recently launched a Kickstarter for the second edition of his TTRPG, having previously had a successful Kickstarter for the first launch. I like TTRPGs, so do all my friends. I'm also a digital artist, as are a lot of my friends, and I've taken a hard stance against AI ""art"" programs, and so have my friends.

I found out about his Kickstarter from my mom, as I live in a different city to the rest of my family, and while I don't have a bad relationship with my brother, we just don't talk frequently because we're both very bad at communication. However, I do have a close relationship with our mom, and talk to her often, so she asked me to share his Kickstarter with my friends as the people I know would be ""..Much more into that sort of thing"" than the people she knew, which is true. However, when I went to look at his Kickstarter, I saw that he had used an AI image generation program to create all of art for his book (he was very open about this fact on the page). His reasoning for doing so is that he doesn't have the money to hire an artist, but wanted to make this edition a big improvement from the first iteration (which had no art, just written info). He also says that the Kickstarter money would only be enough to physically publish the book, with no room for hiring an artist when it's fully funded, so they aren't just ""placeholder images"". Once I read that, I almost immediately sent a message to our mom explaining that I couldn't back it or share it with my friends because of his AI usage, but I stopped myself and have decided not to mention it just yet.

I'm worried that if I do choose to not share/fund it that I'll be damaging his chances of getting it fully funded, and making it so that the hard work I know he put into making the game itself better would be wasted. That me choosing to do this just because I'm so anti AI ""art"" could be an asshole move.

I have explained to her that I am willing to try other things that she wants, but she only wants this.

One of his good mates in college (potentially part of the wedding party) has a serious girlfriend of 3 years who has been to multiple double dates and group hangouts with us. We have each others added on social media and maintain a decent friendship up until 3 months ago, when she commented on our engagement announcement post saying (jokingly) that my fiance’s facial expression looks so unnatural as if he’s being forced. I find this outrageous and can’t possibly understand why anyone would say something like this to a bride-to-be instead of simply congratulating the couple. Before this specific incident, this girl has occasionally made multiple negative remarks that made me uncomfortable. I’ve always chose to let it slide for the sake of my fiance and his friendship, however this incident with my engagement announcement is the final straw for me. For the past few months, I have been refusing to talk to her or show up to any social gathering if she is there and have directly told my fiance that I do not wish to continue being friends with someone who lacks common sense and doesn’t even think before they speak.

My fiance is still close friends with her boyfriend and might ask him to be one of his groomsmen. I understand that extending a plus-one to members of the wedding party is the right thing to do. I don't mind him bringing her as his plus-one as long as I don't have to talk or interact with this person. Since it's my wedding day, I genuinely don't want to hear any of her inconsiderate, unsolicited opinions about my dress, my appearance, or the preparation of the event that might ruin my mood for the day. She had a real tendency to do this and i just don't want to risk spoiling the vibes on what's supposed to be the happiest day of my life. My fiance thinks it might come off as rude if i don't personally address an invitation to her and avoid her like the plague at the wedding since we've always been friendly up until this point with no explanation given on why I completely cut her off. I would prefer not to start any drama or ruin my fiance's friendship of 10 years, which would definitely hurt his feelings and affect our relationship, especially since he doesn't have many close friends who has been in his life for so long.

For example, he has been overweight his entire adult life due to watching TV, eating crap and never doing exercise. He doesn’t walk due to his “health problems” leading to other family members housing and looking after him.

A few months ago he got diagnosed as clinically obese and pre-diabetic. He panicked and asked me to help and I said yes, so we got him some medication as he mostly wanted that. And we did like 6 exercise sessions before he said it wasn’t helping (as if 6 sessions was enough to tell).

My separated parents have financially ruined themselves keeping him home, so he floated the idea of moving in with me and my partner. We’re totally open to helping him lose weight and live a more healthy lifestyle too, however he doesn’t know that we have plans for that.

If he moves in we would continue our lifestyle (no TV, minimal junk food, home cooked meals, weekly gym). However we don’t want him to buy his own food and watch TV etc.

We were thinking of cancelling our Wi-Fi and making him pay for his own data, filling the cupboards with jars and grain to stop him from keeping junk food, banning food from the bedroom to make him come out, and making him volunteer in a thrift store to make him work.

Then after I say something I think “oh that was rude..” and I feel bad. I’m really trying to work on it because when I’m around my mom I feel like I’m being attacked by most things she says. It feels like she’s trying to belittle me and make me feel bad for having emotions. I’m worried that might not be her intention. 

My ex (24) went on a family vacation with us and my mom and brother (24) and somehow they all ended up ganging up on me and trying to tear me down for humor. This usually happens at a lot of family gatherings. Anyways that night I ended up having an anxiety attack so bad I threw up. I

 feel like I’m afraid my mom will try to get really close to my current boyfriend and somehow get him to gang up on me with her. After process those emotions and talking to my boyfriend about this I felt better, but I think I’ve realized these mixed feelings about my mom stems from childhood. 

When I was in 4th or 5th grade (my memory isn’t very good from these years up until maybe sophomore year of high school because of the men I chose abusing me emotionally and physically) I got 💲A from a family member who’s supposed to be my older role model/best friend (hopefully you can read between the lines), anyways I told my mom a year or so later and she told me “Stop making stuff up for attention and if it did happen get over it.” 

Another situation happened with my first boyfriend Freshman year of high school, he ended up rap me. I opened up to mom about it Junior year of highschool because I had been experiencing derealization for a long time and I was sick of feeling that way. She again told me things like, “Stop making things up for attention.” “If this really happened why didn’t you tell me and we go to the police.” I just went mute kinda. She asked me if I wanted to go to the police now, but that was Freshman year and I had already processed it and accepted it. I didn’t want to reopen that trauma. 

Sophomore year of high school I begged my mom to see a therapist and she got me one. In my sessions she’d dig in my past which was expected, and she’d talk about my mom a lot. Our sessions ended up turning into a lot of conversation about my mom and she kinda pointed me in the direction of there is a problem there. I felt like the sessions weren’t working and so got so much anxiety about going, so I stopped going. (Side note: the family member that 💲A me apologized and I am good now, but my mother never did.)

So AITA, for feeling like 32 year oldan screaming 1 year old toddler in the face is just plain crazy.",0.0,0.010772153735160828,0,1
135,1dpjlxk,AITA (am I the asshole),"Aita for wanting my best friend to break up with her boyfriend? Me and my best friend have been friends for about 17 years and roommates for over a year. Our lease is almost up and she said she wanted to move in with her boyfriend. I didn't have a problem with that knowing I could afford my own place. 

Now that we're coming closer to our move out date things have changed. I've missed almost a month of work because of an injury to my foot. And Her boyfriend was out of work for 2 months. So now I'm moving back in with my parents to build my savings back up and apparently that's ""selfish of me"". 

I got a text from her bf asking if I could renew our lease because my roommate didn't have money for a new place. And when I told him I didn't have enough money to renew our lease and that I needed to move back in with my parents he got mad at me. First he started explaining my own bills to me as if I don't know how many bills I have then he said my roommate was going to be homeless and I needed to think of everyone here. 

My roommate has a loving family and a grandpa that would literally do anything for her. So I reassured him her family would never let her be homeless and once again said I couldn't afford it. But he kept going. I eventually told him to stop making me feel like crap for doing what's best for me. But once again he wouldn't stop. I finally just stopped texting him back and went home to talk to my roommate. 

She was aware of everything as they were talking while He was texting me. Me and her talked and we were okay. She was going to ask her grandpa the next day if she could move in with him. 

But while I was talking to her she made me aware of things he said. And he was telling her complete lies about me. Saying I don't care about her and if she goes homeless. 

A couple days later I hear them on the phone and hear him telling her straight up lies about me. So I walk out of my room and just go off on him. I'm not one for confrontation but I couldn't handle him trying to get between us and try to ruin a 17 year friendship. Eventually I had to go outside to cool off because I was so angry. 

My friend eventually came out side and we talked. She asked me questions about things he told her. Thing that i supposedly said about her. He told her I've been talking trash behind her back when I think no one's listening. 

She told me she wasn't choosing sides and just wants to hear both sides. 

I told her it obviously wasn't true. Anytime I have a problem with her I always talk to her about it, and she knows that. So I told her I don't want him at the apartment anymore and I don't think she should even be with him anymore.

He's trying to break up our friendship and I feel as tho he's trying to control and isolate her. And everytime I mention it to her she just defends him.

136,1dpjgtk,AITA for going off on my roommate for trying to treat me like a housewife?,"I (22M) have been living with my roommate, we’ll call him Jesus (23M) for about a year now. We met while working together at Home Depot and hit it off so well that we decided to move in together. I’m gay, and Jesus is straight, and we’ve always had a great friendship. I’m naturally a tidier person, so I usually end up doing most of the cleaning around the house.

Since I get home from work earlier than Jesus, I sometimes cook extra for him, but I never thought much of it. However, things have taken a turn lately. Jesus has started to expect me to always have the house clean and a hot meal ready for him when he gets home. When I don’t, he gets angry and starts acting like it’s my job. I shrugged it off at first, thinking he was just having a bad day, but it kept happening.

Things came to a head last weekend. Jesus recently got a girlfriend, and we were all hanging out – me, my boyfriend, and Jesus’s girlfriend. When Jesus came home from work that night and saw that there were a couple of dirty dishes in the sink and the house wasn’t entirely clean. He went ballistic. Jesus yelled at me “Why the hell isn’t the house clean? And why you ain’t cook nothing?” I was taken aback. I told him “We’re all just hanging out, and there are only a few dishes. You’ve got two hands, use them if you care so much.” He got even angrier and said “It’s not my job to clean up your mess. You’re home all day, you should’ve done it.” I snapped and told him “First off, I’m not home all day. I work too. Secondly, You’ve got a girlfriend now, ask her to cook for you?” Jesus’s girlfriend looked embarrassed, and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. After that I said “I’m not your fucking housewife, Jesus. And I’m not going let any man that I’m not fucking treat me like one. You’re a grown ass man do your own damn chores.”

We argued for over 10 mins, and Jesus kept insisting that since I’m the one who’s usually home first, it’s my responsibility to keep the place clean and cook. I told him he’s being stupid and that this arrangement isn’t working if he’s going to treat me like his personal maid.

137,1dpjbpe,AITA for letting my mom go to my graduation? ,"AITA for letting my mom go to my graduation?

So, I just had the worst graduation ever. My mom went out of her way to fly over to Canada from Ukraine to see me graduate high school. The thing is that I live with my dad and his wife, I’ve lived with them for about 5 years now. Our school announced that there is a limit of 2 tickets per student. At first my mom wasn’t sure if she will be able to make it and come to Canada so I told my dad and stepmom that my mom is not sure yet but she hopes to come. Then about more than a month before graduation I told them that she is for sure coming, and I thought that was enough for them to understand that I want to see her instead of my stepmom. So the day before the graduation I come to talk to my dad about the tickets, because a little earlier he told me that him and the stepmom are coming. I was a bit confused as to why he decided that he gets to make that decision. But I had exams coming and I didn’t want to fight as my mental health would take a hit right before exams. So I waited until I was done with exams and took a breather. Then I spoke to him about it and said that I want my mom there rather than step mom. But he told me no, that my stepmom is coming at that’s that. Because apparently he already told her she can come. The next day I see tickets that he took for himself and my stepmom on my desk, I asked him about it and he said that he told my stepmom that I want to see my mom there and not her and now she’s upset and is mad at me. He then said that I was the reason why him and her had a fight. And that I was wrong for coming to speak to him and not her as well. Also, my dad told me that he doesn’t want to go with my mom because he hates her and is disgusted to be near her. For the record he is the reason she left (physical and mental abuse, his mother my grandmother hated my mom because she thought my mom was below their standards in terms of wealth and made up a story of my mom cheating.) They were gonna frame my mom for drug use and take her parental rights away and I quote “lock her up in an asylum”. Anyway, my stepmom was not getting ready so I figured that my mom is coming with a ticket then (my mom was gonna beg the staff to let her in without a seat just to be there). My dad messed up the time and wasn’t ready on time, was purposely slowly getting ready while I got there late because of that. On the way there he told me how I’m wrong and I have to apologize to my stepmom and how I’m an egoistic person and called me many names right before the ceremony. I felt sick and didn’t even want to be there anymore. Even though I believe there should not have been a conversation like that in the first place. It’s common sense that I want my mom there no matter what. Or at least she should have just told me that she wanted me to talk to her, or better yet come and talk to me about it herself.

138,1dpj401,AITA? House mate with different sleep schedule ,"Hello me and my significant other currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment and recently one of his friends that we were living with thought the year moved out and another one of their friends took over the lease. This friend has work that requires them to wake up really early usually at around (3-5am). I personally do not like this friend because he is comfortable saying racial slurs and just has not won any brownie points with me throughout the duration of me knowing them. This is some context as to why I am not very empathetic towards this friend. 

Moreover, I luckily was able to get somewhat of a summer after graduating college before starting my next job and my sleep schedule usually falls between (11am-3am) for this micro summer break theirs is from (12am-5am). This friend basically is a very light sleeper and claims that he absolutely cannot sleep because of the fact that I am up practically until he has to wake up. The way he went about it was demanding and told us that we needed to be in bed by 12 am every night. They made it seem like I was completely in the wrong for staying up late watching tv (on the quiet setting). They practically made it sound like any type of noise such as walking from one room to the next would instantly wake them up. I myself am not a loud person in general so I think this friend is overly sensitive. I have lived with people all throughout my college career and never had an issue like this with having the same sleep schedule I have now. I told them that I understand that they have to wake up early but at the same time I won’t bend over backwards for you (i.e forcing myself to change my sleep schedule) I tried to reach a compromise that I will be more conscious about the noise that I am making while they are asleep.But honestly I feel like they won’t be happy until I am on the same sleep schedule as they are and right now i don’t want to do that. 

From my point of view though I didn’t even want them to move in the first place. Their attitude about the situation was just super condescending. I only agreed to let the move in because it was my significant others friend and I felt like I had to be nice about it and from where I stand if they were that sensitive to noise they are grown they should have got their own apartment. With living with other people these are some of the things u have to deal with it’s not gonna be perfect. If they want peace and quiet so bad next time pay extra money to get your own place.

139,1dpj3ca,AITA for avoiding meeting mom's new boyfriend and telling her not to bring him on our annual camping trip?,"I(23F) live with my mom (45F) and sister (19F). My parents got divorced when I was in middle school and it was an ugly but necessary separation. Since then, my mother has tried to date several times, with a few more ""serious"" strings of dating, but I feel that she is immature in her relationships and as a person overall in her treatment of others, and it has led to a few of her dating relationships falling apart from petty conflict or due to a misalignment of expectations. Her most recent relationship ended last year and it was a solid 2 year relationship which she waited a few months before introducing us, and ended on mutual terms.

An issue I have with her personality is that she doesn't really spend time with us as a family, and that connection feels long gone to where I do not care much for it. That is, until she is in a relationship, at which point everything has to be done together as a group. It feels fake. 

She asked me a week ago, what I think of her bringing Mark(40'sM) over to the house sometime soon. She met Mark about a month and a half ago and quickly exponentially increased how often they spend time together, with it now being around 3-4 days a week of dates and staying over at his. Everytime they go out she comes back with flowers and goes to restaurants every day with him. He works in construction from what she has said, and has a bigger house than ours. He apparently has ""expressed interest in taking all of us on vacation."" I am happy that she has found someone who shares a similar life story and culture to hers (she had only dated american guys up to this point though we are from another country, aside from my father, and most men from our culture are unreliable and alcoholics). She feels in love and has connected quickly with him, but I could not care less about meeting the guy, which I told her. 

My exact words were ""I mean it's your house, you can do what you want."" She asked what I meant by that, and I explained ""It's always tiring and stressful to have a stranger in the house. I'll be nice, sure, but to be honest with you, I just don't care."" She took it very personally and said that it was the worst thing I could've said. In my mind, I meant it in the way of 'we're both adults and you're allowed to date now, without having to act like this is a new stepdad or father figure' and also that she could focus on her relationship with him without worrying about my opinion or evaluation. I received the silent treatment for a week, and spent time at my boyfriend's house. We never really talked about it again, as I knew she would blow up about feeling rejected again.

Today, she asked me and my sister to clean the house as he was coming over to help with something with her car, he would arrive at 5:30 and she would order pizza. We cleaned without complaint as it was the living room and kitchen, but the more me and my sister discussed it, the more we realized we were not excited for this and even dreaded it. In my opinion, it's way too soon to make us meet someone who could frankly be a murderer or total weirdo and in my opinion is love bombing my mother. I feel that this is the honeymoon phase and he has his own place she can clearly easily spend time at with him. I got ready for work, and my sister went out with a friend. 

When she arrived home, she called my sister and asked where we ran off to/where we are going. I didn't inform her previously that I worked in the afternoon and she wasn't happy that I wouldn't be home. I told her that I honestly did not want to meet him today either way and that I'd be open to it in the future. I think it is too soon right now, but that they will have the house to themselves. She reacted very negatively and said she told him he would meet us today. I explained that she is not taking our feelings into account and to think of this from our perspective and how weird it is to have to get to know someone when  she doesn't even know if this is serious yet. I don't feel like having a man in the house that I do not know, anywhere near my living space. She then started yelling ""IT'S MY DECISION!"" for when to introduce him or bring him over. I snapped at that point and said ""okay, well it's my decision to know him or not, and to be nice or not. I don't want to know him, not now, and probably not for a while. Don't even think about bringing him on the camping trip."" She shouted back again that it's her decision for that as well, angrier. As I was leaving for work, she shouted down the stairs to get out of the house as he was going to be there soon. I just said ""okay"" and left. When I came back, he wasn't there, and she has locked herself in her room. I am anticipating the silent treatment for a week of longer. AITA? 

Tldr; Mom tried to surprise me and sister with same day visit from new boyfriend of 1.5 months, we both skipped out on it and I told her that I didn't want to meet him anyway.

Don't even think about bringing him on the camping trip."" She shouted back again that it's her decision for that as well, angrier. As I was leaving for work, she shouted down the stairs to get out of the house as he was going to be there soon. I just said ""okay"" and left. When I came back, he wasn't there, and she has locked herself in her room. I am anticipating the silent treatment for a week of longer. AITA? 

Tldr; Mom tried to surprise me and sister with same day visit from new boyfriend of 1.5 months, we both skipped out on it and I told her that I didn't want to meet him anyway. Mom got offended and said it's her decision on when to introduce us, I said not to invite him to our camping trip next month.",,0.08229389041662216,0,0
140,1dpirhx,AITA - My friend takes forever to find time to watch our show,"AITA??? My friend and I love watching tv shows together - honestly great quality time spent. BUT say we finish season 1, and we wait for season 2 to come out - he’s never ready to dive back into it, he’s like “let’s watch something else I’m just not in the mood to watch it.” But I absolutely LOVE the show. And it takes us a very long time to finish the shows we’re currently watching because I have to wait until he’s in the mood to watch it which could be like 2 episodes every other week. 
For example!!!! Shogun - amazing right?? We were keeping up with it as the episodes were coming out but then we missed a few because we were busy. Any time we’d sit down to watch something I’d say “can we catch up on Shogun?? I’m trying to avoid spoilers and we left off at a good part.” His response: “ehhhhhh, next time next time I promise. Let’s watch xyz” 

All of that to say….. I am dying to catch up on the Bear because season 3 just came out but he’s just never in the mood to watch. Am I the asshole if I start watching by myself and then when he’s ready I’ll just watch it again with him but act like I’ve never seen it????? HELP lmaoo

I ended up saying fuck with a similar situation. We started watching Chainsaw Man when it came out but then missed a few episodes. That show came out in 2022……I’ve been asking him religiously if we could finish and he said no. So recently I watched the whole thing by myself and out of no where one day he goes “oh we never finished Chainsaw Man, we should totally watch that.” And I accidentally said ..”you didn’t finish that already???” And he flipped tf out lol so tell me.

We have known each other since elementary school. We where best of friends growing up. Knowing what I do now and things I have excepted in our relationship I don't know how to feel anymore. My husband we will call Joe for now has an addiction to sex. He once asked me for an open marriage witch I really didn't want but to make him happy we gave it a try as a couple. Needless to say it didn't work. Joe watches video and talks to other females online and has even shared photos with them. I don't really like it and have told him that I would try and be understanding to his particular situation. How ever I start to feel like he only has sex with me when I am his last opinion or he talks to them to be able to picture me as someone else while making love. I have asked him and he tells me no. The gut feeling is still there. Now I will admit I may not be the best looking woman nor am I a skinny woman. However I think that if I was the one he loved he wouldn't be on the phone with one of them and then when he can't he will come and use me. Am I an idiot for feeling this way or am I right? I know most won't understand our relationship. So let me try to break it down. We have agreed to no actual physical contact with any other partners, and he has kept it strictly to his phone however I don't at all I just can't. When I took my vows I ment them.

142,1dpi95i,AITAH for making fat jokes about myself which made my friend insecure?,"Hi, I am 27-years old and female. I have been friends with this male friend for about 5-years. I am a straight woman and he is a gay male. Hence there is no attraction towards each other. My friend is a sensitive person who has anxiety and depression. Even the smallest things can set him off and I never understood it. 

Yesterday, my two friends were playing a video game together and they typically like to join voice chats and in-game chats in which you can type to each other. I believe they were in the in-game chats. Sometimes, people can be nasty towards each other. My friend “Y” told me that people were bothering “J” and bullying him. A whole group of people were bullying him and they were on the same team. The next day, he left the group chat in which me and 3 other people re in it.

So Y tells me about what happened yesterday. I decide to do what I think is right and I text J to see if he’s doing alright. He answers back very vaguely and just says that he’s not okay and that he wanted to avoid the conversation yesterday. I decide not to press further because he does not seem to be opening up. BTW, yesterday I did not reply a lot in the group chat. I even checked my messages, I only spoke about work and my training. 4-hrs later, my friend “F” texts and is like “He is upset because me and you make fat jokes”. I was very puzzled on what she meant. Then I thought about it and I make fun of myself a lot, I tend to be the jokester of the group. I say “big back activity” whenever I buy a large meal. It’s for myself and no one else. F tells me further that it strikes a cord with J because he is gaining weight and insecure about his body. J kind of went behind my back and told F the truth instead of confronting me about it. I’d gladly stop making stupid jokes if he just told me. So I wanna know… AITAH?

My parent expects me to be Kats caretaker when they are out of town giving me the options of I’d have to either stay with Kat at my parents home and commute 3h/day + get a rover for afternoon walks or have a rover come take Kat for afternoon walks from my place in the city. I do not want to do the sometimes 15 hours of extra driving a week option 1 entails, and it can be even up to two weeks at a time. I don’t like option 2 because Kat also has general anxiety in new/unfamiliar places and they aren’t at my apartment enough to feel at ease there so Kat throws up often when they stay with me and barks at the door for long periods when I leave (also no dog on the lease).

I have suggested maybe getting Kat a rover that would stay at my parents house.

Anyway she asked if she could come over and stay the night and bring her friend. I reluctantly said yes. They come and stay and she tells me her friend is pregnant and has had no medical care, so I call the doctor and set up an appointment and kind of become this girls support system. We get to the doctors office and she is due in literally 3 weeks,  She has this baby and I haven’t really heard from her until three months later. She had messaged me asking if I could take her baby because she couldn’t do it and she was struggling. So I had told her yes and she dropped him off. I thought maybe it’d be for the night or maybe even a week, but it was basically whenever she wanted to go party or meet up with guys.

Anyway it’s court ordered that she gets him Monday til Tuesday and holidays.

149,1dpgqvh,AITA Holding back financial help for daughter,"My adult daughter is getting married and they are saving for wedding and have a significant amount of debt and not-so-great credit. They live together, are both employed and they have four large dogs--two of which have medical conditions needing monthly medications..

Much of the debt is on a Synchrony credit card (24%) used solely for vet bills and the remainder is on a Visa. In the past, they have said they struggle to afford to grocery shop.

Recently they planned a long weekend trip and hired a dog sitter; but one of the dogs did not like her so the sitter bailed and they came back losing some money on a Air BNB.

My financial deal was that for every payment made on both of those accounts, I would match 50% of it.  So if they paid $100, I'd pay $50.  I have been doing that and usually matching it dollar for dollar.

Now she tells me they are adopting another dog of similar size. It was tossed from a car and they were ""fostering"" it.

I told her that was a horrible decision since the dogs are a good portion of the debt and the poor credit. They essentially prevent you from going for a long weekend away (or a honeymoon), and it is nearly impossible to go visit friends because bringing four (now five) dogs is really a huge imposition. I also said I might consider stopping the deal we had to pay off the debt.

The response was she did not want to take any more money if it was conditional; and that they'd take care of it themselves.  Convo ended in a huff.

Now they both love animals and that is admirable. But I feel they are way over extending themselves.

So, based on that, AITAH for stopping our financial deal?  Part of me thinks a deal is a deal. The other part says, what is she thinking. 

For perspective, the total debt is about $12K and I have put in just shy of $5K. So there has been a large dent already.

150,1dpgqdi,AITA for standing my ground and letting a friendship end because of a Bridezilla ,"I, 30 y/o female, attended a friend's wedding where my fiancé was a groomsman. The bride & I became close during her wedding planning, talking daily & sharing details. She initially asked me to be a bridesmaid, retracted the offer, asked again, & then retracted it again. As the wedding approached, she relied on me for emotional support, particularly about issues with her MOH, who was problematic & almost got kicked out. 

Fast forward to the wedding weekend. For context, the Airbnb to the venue is 1 hour, & the bride's house is in the middle. We all stayed in an Airbnb at the bride's request. She asked me to pick up the wedding cake, which was an hour from the Airbnb & two hours from the venue. I agreed. Later, I was asked to pick up supplies from her house & bring them to the Airbnb, which I also did. While the bridal party was at rehearsal, me & a friend, Kayla, were tasked with setting up a Mama Mia night for the bride after one bridesmaid ran out of time. However, although Kayla & I were initially told we were invited, when it started, the MOH slammed the door on us, saying it was for bridesmaids only.

One bridesmaid, Amanda, started making advances toward my fiancé & other married men, saying she didn’t care if they were married. Jamie, another friend, overheard this & told Kayla & me.

Saturday: wedding day. I helped decorate the bridal suite, which another bridesmaid failed to do. I also steamed six groomsmen's suits since I was the only one with a steamer and they were all horribly wrinkled. The wedding was poorly organized: no non-alcoholic drinks except water, reused unrinsed cups, & insufficient food (dry, cold pasta). The bride ignored Kayla, Jamie , & me the entire time. After the wedding, Amanda continued to make advances.

Sunday: ""I Do"" BBQ, the bride confronted me in the bathroom. I explained everything, but she dismissed it as a miscommunication. When Amanda continued her inappropriate behavior, I warned the bride I would handle it. Amandas advances continued, even spreading her legs in front of the men. Many people, including the groom's family & friends, noticed Amanda’s behavior & asked us about it. Later, Amanda boxed me in when I tried to talk to my fiancé, exaggerating her reaction when I bumped her with my elbow throwing herself onto the couch spreading her legs in the air all while in a dress. The bride cracked & started yelling & screaming at everyone.

Monday: we'd had enough. The bride was yelling at everyone to clean the Airbnb. Kayla, Jamie, & I decided we were done, packed up, didn’t help, & waited to say goodbye. The bride ignored my attempt to say goodbye & subsequently blocked us on social media. I was used and taken advantage of throughout this entire friendship; never thanked for everything I did that weekend. My fiancé talked to the groom, & apparently, he understands & agrees, but I still haven’t gotten an apology from the groom or bride. In the end, the joke is on me: the groom is a groomsman at my wedding, & we still have to invite her. AITA?

I’ve always lived very frugal in terms of asking my parents for money. I never asked my parents for money outside of family groceries and once and a while friend hangouts, and I even pleaded and cried to my dad to let me get my first job in high school because I wanted a true *responsibility*, and I’ve always been a very hard-working person. My dad has literally told me he wants me focusing on school and doesn’t like that I would always be working. But aside from this, my dad has given me the privilege of helping me pay my tuition and has told me I shouldn’t feel bad about it even though I’ve often cried about it in front of him. 
But, in retrospect, it confuses me that he’s taking it out on me that I’m trying to be reasonable and find cheaper housing that is known for having mostly college students and would be fine distance for someone who could bring a car that is also electric. I already said I would be paying for my parking permit.*

start:

I’m in college (F, 21) and I’m getting my first *real* place with my close friend and potentially 2 others off campus. Yes, my dad does pay for my tuition and my housing. Hence why his has been hell for me because he has a huge say in what can be done with his money, obviously. 

I love my dad so much, but he’s a very explosive person many times. And it’s often very scary to talk to him because of how irritable he gets. Because of this, I’ve had trouble standing my ground and being affirmative about the places I’ve found and the progress I’ve made with finding a place, leases, etc. My dad is giving me a hard time about living off campus, specifically a place that’s only 8 minutes away, 10-15 minutes max with traffic. It’s very, very affordable which is why i thought it would be most convenient for my family to alleviate the stress of paying tuition. He keeps blowing up asking why it’s “not within a <20 minute walking radius,” which insinuates that he won’t be letting me take my car for the second year in a row. I told him this complex was an 8 minute drive approx., and he already groaned, had a terrible reaction, and it just gave me so much anxiety. He got upset at me getting stressed and filling with anxiety at his reaction, and got even more angrier at the whole situation. If my dad could have it his way, he would have me stay on campus all 4 years which he says is due to safety.  I’ve driven for just about a year now, and I drive extremely often. I wouldn’t even be driving far in college, especially if the max radius I would be from campus (living wise) is 15 minutes. If I would be allowed to bring my car, this wouldn’t be an issue at all. My parents have promised me a car by the time I reached this point in college, yet now my dad is talking like there wasn’t a chance that I would be bringing my car.

He accused me of not being on top of things and not being able to “easily find a complex that’s walking distance to the school,” even though I gave him a list of all the options we found and their pros and cons and all important information. This complex was the lowest, came with the most amenities, and was the overall nicest for what you’re paying for and was still in a reasonable location. I haven’t had proper conversations with my dad for days as he’s yelled at me every time we’ve talked about my housing situation, and even goes lengths to say I might as well “not go to school for the year instead of living there,” which is obviously an exaggerated statement but, — I don’t understand my dad’s rationale?

153,1dpfv5z,AITA for telling my cousins to stop pretending he knows what I’m going through after I got dumped? ,"My (23F) cousin (26M) has being annoying me with her advices all week. 

All the names are fake. 

I just got dumped by my now ex-girlfriend of five year, she said lately she’s being questioning if I’m the one. 

Last year my cousin Mark broke up with his girlfriend Emma (25F) of 4 years after he developed felling for his new coworker (23F) He thought about it for two months before actually breaking up. 
He did not cheat but was unhappy in the relationship. 

After my break up my cousin came to my place to comfort me, we had a mcdonald’s and watched one of our childhood movies.
He’s being texting me everyday after this to make sure I’m okay. 
It stared as him listens to me and telling me everything is going to be okay. 
But around day 3 he made comments of how he went through the same thing and how is so happy now.
I know he wanted to give me perspective but some of his comments aren’t very helpful.

For example, I said this around a week after the breakup:

“I miss her and just wanted to know if she is okay, to know how was her day at work” - Me
“Bro, Come on, she not important anymore” - Cousin 

I know I should care but like it’s being a week, and well feelings don’t just go away and I can’t just stop caring about her (I wish it was that easy).

Then he started telling me about how he cried and got angry but was over most of very fast. 
All his advice became the same and every time it made me angrier. 

I felt like even if he was trying to help he was judging me. 

To the issue: 
This weekend I went to his place to play games, it’s being a little less than a month. 
He asked how I’ve been and I told him that I was better but still cried sometimes. 

Then he answered with:
“You have to get over it, she is not coming back and you should stop feeling sorry for yourself. By this time I already going out with girls I meet on dating apps.

I answered:
“You know what? Fuck you Mark. I’m tired of you pretending to know what I’m going through, you’re already over when you dumped Emma”

He tried to answer but I just left his place crying. 

Mark told his mom how I was rude after all his support and a lot of our family members are on his side. 
I think I might have overreacted a little, but was tired of him comparing our situation when he was the one that broke things up and stayed with his ex for a while even if he had already feeling for his coworker. 

My best friend on the other hand told me I did the right thing. She actually helped a lot more than him and listened every time I needed. 

So I need to know IATA? Did I overreact? 

To be clear I am a lot better but I still miss her and actually didn’t cry for a week, but two days before going to Marks place I’ve found some stuff I borrowed form my ex and ended up crying.

154,1dpfq67,AITA for telling my best friend that I get scared telling her how I feel?,"For context, I (19F) have a good friend named Ariana (22F). We have been friends for the last three years and we have more of a sibling dynamic than anything; I look up to her and care a lot about how she views me. 

Usually, I feel like she is going to judge whenever I tell her my feelings or things that are going on in my life. Usually when I tell her my problems or just what I am doing, she doesn’t really respond or express any interest. I feel like most of the time it is her who is talking to me about her life and her problems, and me just being on the other side of it. Which is fine, but sometimes I feel like it is unreciprocated. I feel like if I brought this up, she would be upset with me and have an explosive reaction— just because when it comes to conflict, she is the kind of person to cut off the other friend from her life, and grab at all straws to win the argument. 

I had a falling out a couple months ago with another one of my friends. It made me really sad, and she watched me go through grief over our falling out. They apologized to me a couple days ago and I accepted their apology, and hung out with them and our friends the next day. Ariana saw my location on my Life360 at his house and started spamming me saying “Be so real,” “I’m done with you,” “this is embarrassing.” She removed her location from me. 

The next day, her and I call and she starts yelling at me for doing that and being “embarrassing.” I tell her that it’s my life and she has no reason to project how she feels onto me, and that this reaction is why I feel uncomfortable talking to her about my problems a lot of the time because it’s all about her. 

This is now what made her say to me, Why are we even friends if you feel that way about me? Our whole friendship has been a lie if you feel like this. I’ve only been looking out for your best interest.

Seeing as I, am a gay man who’s room is pink and I get my nails done every so often, I told her that I don’t think I’m the guy she should be saying this too and that I am the least “man” man out there. My mom wanting to hear none of it tried to explain why I was in the wrong. Seeing that the situation was going to get heated I tried to calm the situation down, I used the wrong words however and triggered her more. My sister than tried to explain that I didn’t mean anything by me interrupting and that’s when she said “don’t use his ADHD as an excuse” to which I responded “Therapist queen”, as she is a therapist and I thought it was ironic of her to say that. After some back and forth she told me, in front of my friend that I am only a narcissist person and I can’t love anyone, that I only use and abuse her and others for my own personal benefit. After this my sister tried to step in and calm the situation down, I started crying SILENTLY and my mom looks over to me. Scoffs and says “you only cry to manipulate” after all this she still said I was the asshole because I triggered her into that response but she “takes back” what she said. 

I realize she’s had a rough life and that my bio father was a narcissist who would verbally put her down (this is why she got so triggered I “insulted her profession” by calling her therapist queen) but I still think as a mother, MY MOTHER she shouldn’t say these things to me and than call me the asshole for crying that she told me that… AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-27,"AITA for calling my mother “therapist queen”? Yesterday, I (17M) went to the dining room with my (17F) friend. Sitting there was my mom (45F) and my sister (22F). I had recently gotten a minor toe surgery so I began soaking it in saltwater while talking to them. I need my volunteer hours for school so I had asked her if she knew anything. My mom started to respond when I interrupted her and asked my friend if she wanted to come.

156,1dpfj7p,AITA for choosing to sit with my friend over my new friend.,"I still in high school made a new friend who recently moved to from another country (I will call them Apple) Apple is nice when I first meet them and got a nice impression and I got asked yesterday online if I wanted to be their friend I said yes. Because when I talked to them on Tuesday they were nice and friendly, however I did have a friend tell me they are annoying. Today is now Thursday and I'm already annoyed with them and my other friend Orange. When I walked into class with Blueberry who I had my previous class with I sat with them because that's what I usually do in study. Apple wanted me to sit with them and kept calling me to sit with them and I said no and continued sitting where I was. A while later Apple and Orange kept calling to to sit with them I said no I'm trying to get my classwork done and didn't listen to me what so ever. Orange did try to physically drag me out of my chair it failed while the both kept persisting and I kept saying no. They started making fun of me with dirty joke I will not repeat and yet I told them No and ignored them while they laughed their heads off. Apple did say they would look like me if they were the same skin tone as me even though we wouldn't because of different hair colour, eye colour etc. They still kept making jokes and etc and kept bugging me but I tried ignoring them, then insulting Orange since I was over it telling them if you had 2 braincells then you would know I have school work due (since we are in that class together). It is near the end of class and they have left me alone for a while but I did go to 2 other friends to rant to them about what had happen. I think that it was my choice to sit where I wanted to, but AITA for choosing to sit with my friend over my new friend?

Edit: When i did show them my roblox avatar as a joke Apple pulled out a chair for me to sit by them and I didn't and went to show my other friends and when I had this class on Tuesday I sat somewhere else then I only sat with Apple to help them with another class and try to clear things up for them and Orange also came over and sat with them",Not the A-hole,2024-06-27,"AITA for choosing to sit with my friend over my new friend.

157,1dpfev7,AITA For telling my friend's GF to take care of her cat?,"About a week ago, I (27M) was pre-gaming with a close friend ""Daniel"" (27M) and his GF, ""Tina"" (25F) at Tina's house. I had gone out the night before, so I was going to take it easy and be the DD for the night. We're all just chilling in the living room as they take some shots and drink some seltzers. We're hanging out for like half an hour, when Tina's cat (Oreo) comes up to me on the couch. Let me preface that I love cats, and I have two of my own. Now, Oreo likes to rough house when she plays. Typically, getting on her back and grabbing your hand and play biting it. While I personally find this endearing, it can also be painful AF, especially if the cats claws aren't trimmed. 

The first time I visited a few months ago, I was playing with Oreo and she started scratching me up a bit, nothing crazy, but I did make a comment to Tina how she may need to trim Oreos claws as they were pretty sharp. Tina looked a bit aloof and told me that she never clips her claws. She said she plays like this all the time with her and it's never been a problem, she's just gotten used to the ""love scratches."" I didn't push further, but the next visit a while later, the same thing happened. I asked Tina if she's ever tried trimming Oreo's claws before. She told me that she has tried to do it, but she had a hard time keeping Oreo still by herself, so she just didn't think it was worth it. I genuinely offered to help clip Oreo's claws since they were pretty sharp, and she seemed a bit insulted by this. She said it was fine and proceeded to pick up Oreo and held onto her. 

Back to a week ago, Daniel and Tina are pretty buzzed at this point and Oreo hops on the couch for pets. I start petting her and she randomly spins around and swings her paw into my hand. Cutting from my mid-wrist all the way up the meaty part of my thumb and hand. I shriek like a baby and hop off the couch. Blood is immediately running down my arm. I go over to the kitchen sink and start washing it, Daniel also hops up to help me clean it. While I'm washing out this literal wound in her sink, Tina says ""You really have to be more careful, you know she's a playful cat."" Now, I don't know if it was the pain or what, but I snapped back at her ""You should really learn how to take care of your damn cat!"" Daniel immediately looked pissed, and Tina responded ""Excuse me?!"" I told her that if she's going to entertain the habit of play fighting with Oreo, she could at least trim her claws so this shit doesn't happen. She did not take that well. She yelled for me to GTFO of her house. Daniel then told me that I should just apologize for being a dick to Tina. This actually tilted me. I just told him ""Wtf, no I'mma just go, y'all can find a new chauffeur."" and left. 

Daniel isn't talking to me and last he said was that it was fucked up what I said. It's very uncharacteristic for me to lash out like that, so now I'm wondering if I was in fact the AH.

158,1dpf6jl,WIBTA if I smoked weed while my sober sister crashed in my apartment? ,"My sister is visiting and will be staying with me for the week. She had previously gone to rehab for a marijuana addiction, and has been completely sober since then (almost 2 years!). Smoking marijuana is a part of my regular routine, which she knows. I smoke every night before bed to help me sleep. My question is, while my sister is staying with me, would I be an asshole for smoking in the home while she is here?  

The way I think about it, I wouldn’t think it would be appropriate for a recovered alcoholic to expect people not to drink around them, but my roommate says she feels awkward about it and that we shouldn’t smoke at all. 

I’m obviously going to just ask my sister how she feels about it, but I’m wondering if I’m being entitled for thinking we shouldn’t need to disrupt our routine because she will be staying with us.
