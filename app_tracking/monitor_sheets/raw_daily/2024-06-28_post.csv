0,1dq6g1i,AITA for obeying traffic laws?,"Background info: I live in the Omaha area.  I am staying in a hotel while I house hunt.  I work on the other side of town from the hotel, a 20m drive  This event happened during evening rush hour, 27JUN24.

  
I am on one of the main highways of the area, NE-370.  There is a small construction area halfway from my turn onto this highway and my turn off of this highway.  it's a divided highway, normally two lanes each direction except for noted construction area.  Traffic on this day was heavy.

I am driving the speed limit.  When we reach the construction area I let a black Honda minivan into my lane.  When both lanes open up I maintain my position in left lane because I will at some point be making a left turn.  In left lane I pass black Honda.  Black Honda winds up behind me.   Black Honda rides my ass.  I maintain speed limit.  I do not speed up, I do not slow down.  I am moving with the flow of traffic while maintaining safe following distance with vehicles in front of me.  While driving thusly I am still passing many vehicles who elected for the right lane.

After five miles or so it is time for my left turn at an intersection.  I use my turn signals to indicate upcoming lane change.  Unlike the local bozos I wait until I am in turning lane to slow down.  As soon as I enter turning lane, black Honda honks his horn at me and I get digitus impudicus.

1,1dq6dll,AITA for how I communicated to my boss that I'm leaving the company?,"I feel horrible. 

So, I'm leaving my current company to join a new one in two weeks. 

Today, I gave my two weeks notice to my boss at my current company. Here's how the interaction went down (paraphrased) - 

Me: Hey, just wanted to let you know that my last day is going to be two weeks from now.

Boss: Why? Are you not happy here? Is the work not good? 

Me: No, it's not that but this is a contract position as you know and I've been looking for something more permanent. I've actually really been enjoying the work and had a great experience. I have offers from two other companies now.

Boss: Ok, I understand. Good luck and congratulations on your offers.

Another co-worker also heard this and congratulated me. I was feeling really good and happy for the next two hours.

Then, once I got off work, my dad called and I told him about this interaction. He revealed something about my conversation with my boss and I think I might have messed up. He said I should have started by saying how much I love working at my current company before saying I'm leaving and what my end date is. That way my boss wouldn't have even had to ask if I'm unhappy. She could have gone straight to congratulating me.

I wish I could go back in time and redo the whole conversation, but I can't. All I can do is learn from this and improve my communication skills in the future if I'm the asshole. Am I the asshole? Or at least an idiot/tone deaf?

2,1dqxtf2,AITA for yelling at my mum?,"I 20F live with my parents as I attend university and have a job that is close to home. My 51F mum and 52M dad have always had a rocky relationship. Ever since I remembered my mum has always complained to me about my dad and how he's an awful person. I want to say he is a bad husband but a good father. He works quite a bit, so I don't see him as much as my mum (she works from home most days).

As I have become an adult her complaining has gotten increasingly worse, to the point that I have become her therapist. I have told her to go to therapy but the therapists where I live are expensive and they are usually always booked out. The problem is, is that when she is mad at my dad she will always take it out on me. When I tell her about how it makes me feel, she always says 'You should know my anger is not directed at you' or 'you're so selfish, I have gone through much worse than you and you should suck it up'. But honestly, it takes such a toll on me. In addition to that she does not have many friends whom she can talk to about this and her family does not want to hear her complain as they advised her not to get married to my dad. Because of this I also cancel plans with my friends because I do not want her to feel lonely and depressed.

Last week she started complaining to me again. This time my dad was home. I got fed up and started yelling at my dad to do something about my mum and my mum started to yell at me to not talk to my dad like that. It was just a whole mess. When we cooled down, I told my mum that I yelled at my dad because I was on her side. But she said that I should respect my elders and she would never tell me anything again. However, I know that's a lie as she always comes back to me to complain some more about my dad.

I hate living at home but I cannot move as the degree I am doing requires a lot of unpaid placements that cost quite a bit (think $5,000AUD for each). Sorry if this does not make sense its just hard to write reality down. My question is how do I go about this? Am I just stuck like this until I move out?

I booked a reservation and paid for a relatively fancy meal at a place I've always wanted to go. This was booked two weeks in advance and I've spoken about this place so many times that my partner knows it's an exciting event. My bf got a call from his family yesterday who is all together right now visiting from another state in his hometown. He left the next day to go see them. I couldn't join because of work but mentioned to him about the dinner thinking he couldn't have forgot. He responded as if he would try and make it but might not. The reservation is now tomorrow and he's just confirmed he will come but also his family is deciding to leave tomorrow so it  works out. I feel like he isn't prioritizing me and if his family wasn't leaving he would have bailed. He doesn't see this family often though so I feel guilty for saying I feel unprioritized.

5,1dqwso5,AITA for not really wanting to spend time with my dad?,"I (17 Male) really wanna skip out of spending time with my dad. I never really enjoy his company and disagree with him on a lot of things. Of course I still love him, but he’s just not someone I care to spend my time around at all, and would like to avoid.

My dad recently asked me to spend time and watch a movie with him. I told him I’d really rather not and want to spend time by myself just to relax. For context, I’ve been exhausted and drained from 4 hour daily camps for wrestling in the summer heat, starting with outdoor drills and sprints and killer miles, then going into weight room lifting, then moving into more wrestling. I’m exhausted and want to spend some time off with myself now that the week is over and I have some off days, and the last thing I wanna be doing is hanging out with my dad of all people, who is very challenging to be around.

After I told him I don’t want to and I just wanna relax by myself for a while, he started asking me why? He said “In the 72 hours on the weekend, you can’t sacrifice just 1 for your father” I told him I just don’t wanna watch a movie, and he proceeded to say “wow I appreciate the honesty but you’re breaking my heart.” I simply responded again “I just don’t really want to watch a movie this weekend, these are my only days off.” Which my mom started shootings me looks for. He then stormed off saying “I just want to spend 1 hour with my son and he can’t bare to hang out with me just to watch a movie”

I just want to relax for myself because I won’t get these days off again and I would rather just be alone or with a friend and don’t want to have my father around because of it. He’s just not someone I enjoy being around. AITA?

Edit for extra detail: I know it isn’t a place to defend yourself, but I do wanna say this. So it’s my fault I didn’t cover WHY I don’t enjoy being around him. So he makes many rude remarks to me all the time. He gets all his information about ANYTHING online, then when we disagree with him on it, he gets mad, yells at us (me and my sister) and tells us we’re easily manipulated. Me and my sister are both going to college soon, so we tell him not to post certain things as it’s on a family account. We just don’t want our names tied to whatever he posts, especially when it’s very political. He then tells us we should be proud to be (insert party here) and that he’s posting it anyway. He yells at me for not working hard enough when I go to practice and a part time job 6 days a week, sometimes seven, when I just want to rest for a day. He yells at both me and my sister when we say something he doesn’t agree with. He tries to make us feel like we’re “liars” for not remembering part of a story. He forces all his opinions on us, then makes us for guilty for denying it. Now I can’t to move out to distance myself from him because he’s done plenty of things to me that I simply don’t want to say because of discomfort. He’s an insecure and rude person and that’s why I don’t enjoy being around him. I don’t enjoy his company and don’t like him as a person.

6,1dqwqhp,WIBTA if I call my boyfriend out on his small lies,"Throughout the 3 years we’ve been dating my boyfriend has been very trustworthy. However, there have been a couple little lies he’s told that still haven’t left my mind. For example, the other day we met a couple new people at a gathering hosted by our friend. When they said what town they lived in I got excited and said I also lived in that area. They then turned to my boyfriend and asked where he lived to which he replied “I live there too.” This was completely untrue and he didn’t even say it in a joking way. I know it’s not a huge deal but it did bother me. I almost said something after the event to him but I brushed it off because I thought maybe he didn’t want to give his location or was embarrassed of saying anything about his living situation since he had moved in with his parents a year ago. I also knew if I brought it up he’d probably just say something like “why does it matter.”

2. There was also a time when he told me and all our friends he had gone to a certain college. However, he almost never gave details and something about it seemed a bit off. I still don’t exactly know about this because when I’ve brought it up he gets ,in my opinion, weird about it. When we first started dating, there was a time when I was alone with our mutual friend. The mutual friend mentioned the college she went to and I said “didn’t Alex (my boyfriend) go there too?” She replied “supposedly.” This made me think I wasn’t alone in feeling a bit suspicious. Recently I pushed a little more and he said something about having been in a short program at the college. So maybe it was a half-lie? 

3. The last one on my mind was there was a time when we were introduced to a friend’s friend. He owned a really nice store and since some of the products related directly to my work he offered to give me some free items. A few days later, my boyfriend and I were at dinner and someone mentioned wanting those types of items. My boyfriend immediately said something along the lines of “oh my friend owns a brand with those items! I can get you stuff/connect you two.” It felt weird because the owner had 1. only offered me items and 2. in no way was my boyfriend’s friend. 

These three specific things have been on my mind. I want to bring it up to him because not only does it bother me a bit, it also worries me that other people will start to dislike him. It’ll be really easy for instance, for us to run into the two new people we met and for them to hear him say he lives in a different area to someone else.

7,1dqwme0,AITA for telling my fiancée her family is taking advantage of her?,"My (30M) fiancée (29F) called me today saying she had a moral dilemma. Her SIL (50F) had just called her moments before asking for help with SIL’s daughter’s (fiancée’s niece 19F) university tuition. I believe as a loan so they wouldn’t have to pull out anymore private ones. My fiancée, caught off guard, initially offered $100, but SIL said she was looking for more like $2000. When my fiancée heard that number, she said “oh no, I don’t have that much to spare. SIL then asked “you don’t have anything in your savings account? My fiancée thought that was a little intrusive and said all her savings are tied up in her 401k, that she can’t touch it and finished up the call.

BG: My fiancée comes from a culture that puts a lot of emphasis on family and that may make her feel obligated to help. Financially, we are comfortable for our age. I own a home and still have a mortgage on it, I have no other debt, and I started making 6 figures a year ago. My fiancée makes around 2/3rds my salary and only has about $3k left to go on her student loans. She also recently won a low 5 figure law suit that she told her mother about, but not the amount. I suspect the mother said something to SIL as she called my fiancée and left a message right after SIL did asking for money. SIL and fiancée’s brother (50M) also own a home, but I have no idea how much they owe on it or how much they make. It’s a decent area similar to ours. They flew internationally for a vacation for my fiancée’s brother’s birthday this past year and still have another interstate vacation planned in a few months. On top of that they’ve bought this daughter a bmw as her first car and she is going to university out of state. My thoughts are that they have the money for those luxuries, that the daughter doesn’t have to go to such an expensive university (community college first 2 years then state university is always an option too), and lastly that it’s not even my fiancée’s child so why should she pay anything when we have our own wedding coming up and plans for children ourselves that we’ll need money for.

TLDR at the bottom. I (28M) have a good friend (30M) who takes too many pictures.

I suppose he became this way since he got onto Instagram and online dating apps

It all pretty much started a few months back, we  did a day trip/staycation to our countries capital city. We've both been there atleast 3 times before (many more times myself though) He took 700 photos mostly of himself... I took ~30 (it was a daytrip btw). I expressed some frustration at how the whole thing went and thankfully our first trip abroad started great.  

 

Gradually, unfortunately, it got worse over the course of the trip. He started asking for me to take more and more pictures. He broke rules to take pictures (in a place of worship, where photos are banned - I thought this was so disrespectful). At some places, I paid a fee to be allowed to take pictures - he then insisted on me taking more  and sharing them with him (I refused on the grounds that he ought to have paid to take his own).


My breaking point this trip( our first abroad)was when he asked me to take a picture of him as we were  late heading for an important bus (. I explained it was raining  and we didnt have time,  he became visibly irritated and stopped to take a few selfies. I thought that if hes going to insist anyway i may as well take the photo to get us back quicker and keep the peace. Trying to take the picture  I dropped his phone (obviously accidentally).. he again became (rightfully) visibly upset - It wasn't cracked in the end but I apologised profusely nonetheless and insisted I would pay for any damage, whatever the cost. He was moody for a while after and I couldn't help but feel indignant that he was cross at me for having done him a  favour that i ultimatrly didnt want to do in the first place. I felt guilty so we eventually retook the photos again when the bus came back to that point ), he was fine after that. Nonetheless, I couldn't help but feel like my travel experience suffered for the benefit of his - I honestly felt like a personal photographer that whole trip. 

 he's suggested we go on a longer haul flight/trip to our mutual dream location as soon as next month. I would not tolerate the photo behaviour for once-in-a-lifetime trip like that( I could abide it this time somewhat as the trip was cheap to me). I've thought about getting him a selfie stick/automatic tripod , insisting on one photo only, or just not going with him and doing it solo, but all these options involve not taking his photos in some way.

So, WITBA for refusing to take photos of my friend on holiday?

TL;DR My friend insists that I take several photos of him when we're out (we're talking 700/ day)) but he'll get upset if i refuse to the point where we're both miserable anyway. It all really affects my experience. I love the idea of getting him a selfie stick, and refusing to be a part of his photo taking process Anyway,  WIBTA for refusing to take pictures at all going forwards?

9,1dqwd14,AITA for refusing to confront my aunt who left on a vacation abroad and left her kids at my grandma’s home,"My family likes gathering at my grandma’s home most weekends. Last weekend we talked about my aunt “Emi” that’s on a vacation abroad with her husband and left her 4 kids at my grandma’s home with their nanny (I’m shaky on the ages but I’m pretty sure the eldest is younger than 11, and the youngest is a bit over 2). My grandma doesn’t like being responsible for the kids but is quiet about it. Aunt Emi has done this 4 times now since the youngest was born.

I believe aunt Emi should be more responsible, they’re her kids, and she should either take them with her or at least wait until they’re older, all my aunts agree with this. 

The issue is the way we talked about it, I can’t talk about my aunts but I know my mom, she builds resentment and stays silent about it, then blows up over minor inconveniences because of this frustration, making the person she’s mad at confused why she’s so mad, and she never gets the closure or change in the person’s behaviour she wants, I know that because she’s like this with me, and I’ve heard her talk about me with others similarly.

They were making jokes and discussing the topic. One of my aunts noticed I was quiet and asked me why, I said something like “it’s nothing”. Mom joked that I hate these conversations because I’m sensitive. I replied that the situation just feels clear cut, we all agree so I don’t want us to talk about it behind her back. This started a disagreement, my mom and sister joked about me acting like I’m better than them, I believe that’s not the case. Venting is healing, but this is all her sisters and their daughters talking about her without her, no one has talked about it with her, I believe this will make everyone resent her silently, especially when they’re calling her insults.

Things got worse when they suggested I be the one voicing everyone’s concerns since I’m the one on her side, I said I’d be the worst person to tell her, I’m not that close to aunt Emi, am non confrontational and quiet, if I was the one to tell her it be obvious that I’m echoing the room, I feel it be hurtful and she’d immediately be defensive.

I said, best scenario my grandma tells her, she needs to know my grandma doesn’t like this, and I feel she wouldn’t fully believe it second hand. This is where the disagreement blew up, my mom and aunts are very devoted daughters and felt I was pushing their mom into a fight.

The situation is still going on. I avoid my mom at home because our conversation keeps going in circles, they still want me to bring it up, no one in my family is on my side.

I’ve recently realised that I’m often a control freak that values her opinion to the point where I can dismiss other opinions, I’m worried this is the case here. I asked my friends and they all defend me, but I feel they might be biassed because they only hear my complaints about my family and haven’t experienced my flaws the same way my family has.",Not enough info,2024-06-28,"AITA for refusing to confront my aunt who left on a vacation abroad and left her kids at my grandma’s home My family likes gathering at my grandma’s home most weekends.

10,1dqw5ag,"AITA for standing up to my narcissistic, self-victimizing mom but still doing the tasks she demanded?","I (20M) have a mom who is a narcissistic self-victimizing person. She often has emotional outbursts over very small things. When I was younger, I had a hard time dealing with her and would talk back more than I do now. Many family members have witnessed her outbursts and have told me they don’t blame me for a lot of the stuff she does. Nowadays, I’ve learned to pick my battles, and 99% of the time, I hold my tongue and do whatever it takes to get her to stop (e.g., doing chores or helping her even if I feel it’s her responsibility).

Today, she exploded at me and my brother for finding what she thought was urine on the toilet seat and told us we had to switch off cleaning the bathrooms. Reluctantly, I checked and realized it was actually water. For years, she’s been upset about urine on the seat, so I’ve made it a habit to wipe it down every time I use the bathroom, even if nothing is there. She would complain about it so much so, that I have carried this over to public restrooms as well.

I argued that it was unfair for my brother and me to clean the bathroom since we all have designated chores and rarely help each other. My family’s household is like a union, where everyone is responsible for their own jobs. Despite this, I often help my mom with her chores. After arguing, she called me vulgar names no mother should ever say to her child and assigned me extra tasks, like washing her car, knowing I had work in a few hours. She said I’d have to call in late if I didn’t finish or just call out in general.

Our agreement is that as long as I get good grades and help around the house, I can live here. I have no issue with that and do chores without complaint. The problem arises when my schedule conflicts with her demands, and she accuses me of prioritizing everything over her.

Additionally, my mom is a heavy drinker and often asks me to do things for her because she’s had a “hard day.” I’d get it if it was every once and awhile but at this point it’s multiple times per week. She’s a substitute teacher, it’s summer and the school period has ended. She now spends most of her time doing fun things with my siblings and just sitting at the house yet, still asking for my help despite knowing I have work. I wouldn’t mind helping if she didn’t constantly berate me with unnecessary out-of-pocket comments.

She is my stepmom, and although I don’t want to believe she treats me differently, it feels like she does. She compares me to my dad, who, despite working hard days and long hours as a commercial pilot and when he’s home, fixing things/helping around the house, is also told he’s good for nothing.

My siblings and dad all agree that she goes extremely overboard and are equally tired of it. In the end, I still did the tasks she demanded, despite feeling it was unfair and having work later.

Due to unforeseen circumstances with my girlfriend’s living situation, that timeline has now sped up and we are now looking for a place together to move in as soon as possible (depending on what is available in the market).

I currently live with two housemates on a month-to-month lease. One of them is a friend of four years. I’ll refer to this friend as Caleb.

I texted Caleb and told him that I’ll be moving in with my girlfriend soon, and we’re starting to look at places. Depending on the market, it could take us months to find a place or it could take few days to find a place. Regardless, I’ll be sure to give him a 30 day notice before I commit.

Caleb is now upset because he wanted me to give him a much earlier notice so that he could have more time to find another housemate to replace me. It is also unfortunate timing because Caleb will be out of the country for the next two weeks, so he will not be able to begin his search for another housemate.

I explained that I would’ve given an earlier heads up if I could, but this issue with my girlfriend’s living situation came out of nowhere and was out of our control. If my girlfriend and I find a place that we like, we will ask for the latest possible move-in date to ensure that Caleb has as much time as possible to find a new housemate, but landlords in my area usually want someone to move in within 30 days. I also offered to help in the search for a new housemate.

Our mutual friend, Mike, has heard both sides of our story and agrees that while I am within legal rights to give a 30 day notice, I should offer to pay for a month of rent so that Caleb has more time to find a housemate (e.g., if I move out on August 1st, I would give my 30 day notice on July 1st but I would still pay rent for the month of August so that Caleb has July and August to find a new housemate).

Anyway, when I spotted it, I told my husband (M62) and daughter (F16) that's what it was and reminded them both to please never spit or toss their gum on pavement, and to always dispose of it where that can't happen to someone else - or at least, someone could step on it and if melted (we're in the south) could make a mess on someone's shoe!

(and there are reasons beyond the one I'd given!) He got so defensive and told me not to speak to him that way. He said that all I needed to say was ""pick that up"", that I was out of line, etc. I felt he was turning the whole thing back on me, making me out to be the bad guy, and I defended myself, saying that I was shocked that he'd do such a thing and he must've known he was wrong, and hiding it from me, because of the way he was caught in the act: hand straight down behind him so l couldn't see his hand.
I cont'd the argument because, from my perspective he tends to not take ""criticism"" well and often (not always) turns it back on me, and I'm sorta tired of him not seeing it from my perspective.

15,1dqvcqt,AITA for throwing out food my mum buys knowing I uncontrollably binge on?,"TW for eating disorders, sorry if I write a lot

I am 13 years old and my mum won’t let me buy my own food. 

She’s only bought chocolate, crisps and stuff like that most of my life leading to me being overweight. 

Eventually I asked her to start buying more healthy food, but she didn’t. I have been desperate to go on a diet but I keep binging on the food she buys. 

At some point I couldn’t see any other way and 
I stopped eating, I don’t know if I lost any weight but it definitely made me sick.

I couldn’t handle feeling so hungry and I went back to binging, but feeling more disgusting than before. My mum knew ALL about this. 

Then I became bulimic and again I probably haven’t lost any weight from bulimia. 

I don’t want to be bulimic or binge eat, I want eat fucking normally. Again and again I have asked her to let me eat healthy but just no. 

She thinks if I don’t eat junk food then I’ll become “all thin and bones”. I have like one fruit every damn two months if I’m lucky, and I’m genuinely scared for my health.

Lately I just can’t handle seeing junk food. 
I feel shitty but I have been occasionally throwing food in the bin. But at the same time, it would be a waste for me to eat because I’d just be overeating and probably vomit it up.

16,1dqvb1c,AITA for threatening my stepson ,"
My stepson Ron (fake name, 16M)  living with me (M, 45) and my wife (F, 42) for almost a year now. When my wife and I met, Ron was living with his father. A year ago Ron's father passed away from cancer and he moved into my home. 

There are rules in my house and Ron has to abide by them. Ron's chores at home include washing dishes, scrubbing floors, washing my car (tbh usually I use it as a punishment and the rest of time I prefer car washes). He also has to help me and my wife look after his younger siblings. It's actually not as horrible as it sounds because my wife and I have only one child together (3F). On vacations, my kids from my 1 marriage (7M, 10M) come to me. They don't need constant care, but Ron helps them  occasionally. Nothing too much: sometimes I ask Ron to help them with math or take them for a walk. 

Ron has free time, because he does well academically and goes to the school soccer section. He has also looked for a job from home several times, but always quit after 3-4 weeks, because he tends to be fickle. 

About 1 and ½ months ago Ron started having teenage rebellion. Ron has started snapping, he's often locked in his room. Ron is doing his chores poorly. He doesn't wash dishes well (there are dried sauce stains on the dishes), he uses the vacuum cleaner about 1 a month, and he hasn't wash the floor with a mop in 2 months. I think his grief from father also affected here as well. 
And here's why I can be an asshole. Ron's father was not wealthy, and he left his son a rather modest inheritance. I'm not from the US, and I don't think it makes sense to write the dollar amount. But that money could cover some of the cost of college tuition or it could be used to buy a used car. 

Yes, I admit I did something stupid. But I couldn't take it. I lost it. Yesterday, my wife and I got home at 1:00 a.m. and the house was filthy. There were dishes on the kitchen sink. Ron was sitting in the living room watching f TV (he supposed to be asleep at this time). His little sis was sitting next to him. Ron said she cried for a long time and she calmed down when he turned on the TV. I asked why Ron hadn't called us. He didn't say anything. I don't know what came over me, but I said that since Ron didn't want to fulfill his domestic duties I would spend his inheritance as I saw fit. I didn't really mean that and only wanted to scare him, but it ended in his tantrum. He was yelling, shaking, and threatened to leave the house. My wife had a hard time calming us down and sent him to bed. 

This morning my wife and I had the biggest fight of our lives. Ron wasn't home because my wife had let him go out with friends after the incident. She yelled at me I acted like an ah and I had no right to talk about Ron's inheritance. 

I realize I really have no right to claim Ron's inheritance, but I didn't want to take money from him either. I just wanted to scare him.

17,1dqv9y4,AITA for refusing to push my obese cousin around in a wheelchair for a day?,"My cousin is approaching six-hundred pounds and requires a mobility scooter, as walking even short distances is very painful for her.  In July, she has an out of state wedding to attend, and I was asked to taxi her to and from the event, as I'm not currently employed so my calendar is open.

Unfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.  I can barely push her wheelchair on a paved surface, let alone across grass and dirt.  I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history.

I did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either.

The distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that.

My cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.  Like 100% the thin wheels of the wheelchair are going to dig into the ground, and I am not strong enough to handle that.

It only cost me like 20 bucks and it seemed like such a ridiculous thing to gift someone that I just had to do it.

It's my birthday on Sun, and my family decided yesterday we'll meet for a casual and brief celebration dinner, just getting takeout. This morning my mom asked me if it was alright for her new potential SO to join. They've been dating about a month and met in a funny way:

When we were out of town, our parents all came to our house to help w/ some yard work that had gotten out of control. My in-laws own the house we live in but live 2 hours south, and we pay them rent. We usually do a good job w the yard, but *we're halfway through our first pregnancy* and the first few months were rough, so we got behind. So they and my mom were graciously helping us out, and they invited their old friend over. He is also a contractor and might build a new garage on the property so came to take a look. He and my mom hit it off.

So, when she texted about him coming to dinner, she also mentioned my FIL might come. This was a surprise. My partner had mentioned he might come up on Fri, but the idea that he might \*still\* be here on Sun confused me. I was concerned he might be thinking he'd stay w us the whole weekend and didn't communicate (I wouldn't put it past this family), so I asked my partner to call and find out what was up.

When he called, his mom answered and was sobbing. After a long call, he told me she was extremely upset we didn't invite them to my birthday dinner. Apparently, their old friend/my mom's new date had called them and mentioned he was going to be there. She cried that it was going to just be my mom and their friend now as ""the grandparents"" and they were going to be left out. She said she felt like chopped liver. She didn't want a ""sympathy invite"" either, so they wouldn't come now even if we offered. She said many other things too but that's the jist.

Context: 

- We just took a 5-day trip to OR w them and my SIL literally last week. My birthday, my SIL's birthday, and my MIL's birthdays are all within a week, so even though it wasn't planned, it was mentioned that it was in some ways an informal bday get together.

- We've never invited them to a family bday party before, and have mostly had separate gatherings other than 1 Thanksgiving.

- She was the least overtly excited about the pregnancy of anyone, so it surprises me she's this worried about being left out, and, she won't be.

- Our families are very different. Mine is very ""you do you""/low expectations and we meet up/talk more seldomly (every 4-6 weeks?) His is very ""we do us""/high pressure and they talk on the phone several hours a week even if we just saw them. So I'm open to my family just being the weird one!

21,1dqux2g,AITA for abandoning my friend's farm even though I agreed to watch it for her?,"Fake names. Throwaway

My(30sF) ex-coworker Irene(50sF) has a farm. She fosters dogs & runs a boarding business. Irene is divorcing Ted(he moved out). Their son Christian(40sM) lives w Irene. He is a felon w drug & mental health issues. Christian has a son Johnny(4yoM) w his ex Dolly(30sF).

The issue:

Irene called me. She said she had to see family & get docs for her divorce. She & Christian just had a fight & he was kicked out. She couldn't trust him & asked me to watch the farm. I agreed **for free** if I could bring my dog T bc he had a vet appt nearby. She agreed & said she'd give details later.

A week before her trip, Irene emailed. She had extra client dogs she hadn't mentioned & booked 2 new ones too. This rubbed me the wrong way but I kept quiet bc I knew it would be hard to find other boarding on short notice. Irene also said Christian *might* be visiting to help. He gives me the ick, so I decided to politely refuse if he came by.

The morning of the trip, Christian was there. He said he & Johnny would be staying in the house with me. I was dumbstruck, but both of them left before I could process or protest.

The workload was exhausting. There was no time to eat, drink, or go to the bathroom, & chores were endless. It was obvious I was the first person cleaning in ages.

Christian returned with Johnny & it got worse. Christian left dishes in the sink, laundry on the floor & in the washer until they mildewed. Johnny ran around unsupervised. He left stall doors open for animals to escape. He rode his quad along the fence, & rammed into it when the dogs barked. He screamed, kicked, & spit at my dog.

When I asked Christian to help, he would either say he was ""just about to do it"" or apologize with empty promises, then never do it. He took smoke breaks, or watched Tiktok or Netflix. He went out shopping or partying for hours. He bullied Dolly into doing his chores if she came by to visit Johnny & belittled her constantly.

Irene's communication was short & sparse. She didn't call until midway in the week. I told her Christian was slacking off but not to confront him right away. I didn't want to risk retaliation. She seemed offended that I felt nervous.

I had enough & made a plan to leave. The morning of T's appt, I packed the car & gave the animals extra care. I went to the vet & texted Irene & Christian that I wasn't coming back & why. I blocked them on everything & came home to cry & sleep.

Now I'm feeling guilty for leaving the animals, even if it was only 2 days. Some friends say I could have toughed it out, while others think it's not abandonment since Christian is there. My husband is furious with Irene.

So, aita?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-28,"AITA for abandoning my friend's farm even though I agreed to watch it for her? Fake names. Throwaway

My(30sF) ex-coworker Irene(50sF) has a farm. She fosters dogs & runs a boarding business. Irene is divorcing Ted(he moved out). Their son Christian(40sM) lives w Irene. He is a felon w drug & mental health issues. Christian has a son Johnny(4yoM) w his ex Dolly(30sF).

The issue:

Irene called me. She said she had to see family & get docs for her divorce. She & Christian just had a fight & he was kicked out. She couldn't trust him & asked me to watch the farm. I agreed **for free** if I could bring my dog T bc he had a vet appt nearby. She agreed & said she'd give details later.

A week before her trip, Irene emailed. She had extra client dogs she hadn't mentioned & booked 2 new ones too. This rubbed me the wrong way but I kept quiet bc I knew it would be hard to find other boarding on short notice. Irene also said Christian *might* be visiting to help. He gives me the ick, so I decided to politely refuse if he came by.

The morning of the trip, Christian was there. He said he & Johnny would be staying in the house with me. I was dumbstruck, but both of them left before I could process or protest.

The workload was exhausting. There was no time to eat, drink, or go to the bathroom, & chores were endless. It was obvious I was the first person cleaning in ages.

Christian returned with Johnny & it got worse. Christian left dishes in the sink, laundry on the floor & in the washer until they mildewed. Johnny ran around unsupervised. He left stall doors open for animals to escape. He rode his quad along the fence, & rammed into it when the dogs barked. He screamed, kicked, & spit at my dog.

When I asked Christian to help, he would either say he was ""just about to do it"" or apologize with empty promises, then never do it. He took smoke breaks, or watched Tiktok or Netflix. He went out shopping or partying for hours. He bullied Dolly into doing his chores if she came by to visit Johnny & belittled her constantly.

Irene's communication was short & sparse. She didn't call until midway in the week. I told her Christian was slacking off but not to confront him right away. I didn't want to risk retaliation. She seemed offended that I felt nervous.

I had enough & made a plan to leave. The morning of T's appt, I packed the car & gave the animals extra care. I went to the vet & texted Irene & Christian that I wasn't coming back & why. I blocked them on everything & came home to cry & sleep.

Another roommate and I had a pretty similar schedules where we would both wake up early to go to work and go to bed around 11pm. The other two roommates would always sleep in late and always make a disaster in the kitchen at night. I swear both of them would cook themselves dinner at like 10:30pm or sometimes even at 12am. I didn’t mind the noise in the kitchen because they were cooking themselves dinner, but when it came to eating dinner they would always watch TV in the living room and it would always wake me up. Countless times I asked for them to turn it down but they never did. It never really became a problem until one weekend. This weekend both these two girls had their boyfriends over staying in our apartment. Every night, from Saturday till Monday, they would all watch scary movies on the couch till sometimes even 3am. I asked them multiple times to turn it down or be considerate that my other roommate and I were trying to get some sleep. They didn’t care and continued to blast the TV. One morning after not getting any sleep the night before due to them I woke up at 7am like I always did before work and began to cook myself breakfast. While cooking, I always listen to music with my AirPods in, being considerate that everyone was sleeping. But this morning I decided to blast my music and give the girls the same treatment they had given us. They got so pissed that I woke them up that it lead to this whole fight. They called me petty amongst many other names from waking them up. I believe I was just giving them the same respect they’ve given me every other time they woke me up. Am I in the wrong here?

On my first day, I reconnected with an old friend and we became best friends. However, problems arose last year when she started ignoring me and prioritizing her other friends. We had planned to create a shoebox filled with memories as a symbol of our friendship, but she ended up doing it with her other friends without me. This made me feel angry and upset about past experiences with my old friends, which has made it difficult for me to make new friends.

Last week, I discovered that she ordered a senior jacket with her other friends despite promising to do it together. She then asked if I was getting the jacket soon, but I explained that I couldn't because the store required a minimum order of five jackets and I didn't know anyone else interested. On Teachers Day, I expected to spend time with her during the extended lunch break, but she chose to stay with her other friends, leaving me alone at the table. There have been instances where she lied about not being able to see me during lunch, only for me to find her with her other friends.

We also planned a movie night, but she cancelled last minute to have a tea party with her other friends. It is frustrating that she made plans knowing she wouldn't be able to come. During exam time, she abruptly left our conversation to join her other friends. Furthermore, she sent me a TikTok suggesting we match outfits, similar to the ones she and her other friends have.

26,1dqu8c1,AITA for not paying my friend/roommate back over $200?,"Hi, I've never posted on Reddit before, & this is just a burner account. I've tried asking 2 of the very few people I have that I can go to for advice & I haven't gotten a response from them that I feel answers my question. So… Hi, Reddit!

So, for some context, my roommate (26F) & I (23F) have been friends for a few years now. We met at work, hit it off, & have since been super close. Last year, we decided to move in together because we both were in less than ideal living situations, both needed a place to go, & it seemed like a good idea. We moved in June 2023 & everything was great. Previously, we had discussed finances & had an agreement that we'd split the cost of rent, groceries, furniture, etc in half. For rent, I would pay online & she would CashApp me her half. That happened with no issue for July, August, September, & October. She'd always pay on time.

Then November rolled around. She never paid the CashApp request I sent. December came, she didn't pay. January, February, March, April, May. Now we're in June. The last several months have been both very frustrating & depressing for me. I lost my job in early March, have been on unemployment & have been on an endless job search only to be ghosted by or rejected by jobs. I'm very overwhelmed, & it stresses even more seeing my bank account drain of money. When we moved in, I had roughly $15,000. Now I only have around $3,000.

As of now, she is caught up to February, but it's mainly been stuff like, ""Oh I paid for dinner, do you just wanna take half of that expense off of what I owe you?"" Then in May, she’d send $200ish every Friday. We had a bit of a miscommunication & I thought she was back-paying what she owes, but her intention was to pay in advance for upcoming rent in June.

Now this is where we come to the present.

So, early this month/June, she sent me $250 that she was going to use to pay forward for July's rent. The rest of the month comes along, & she doesn't send anything else. Then yesterday I told her that, ""I'm gonna send you my half of rent ($651) that way you can pay for July because I am not paying the full amount on my own again.""

Then she responded asking, ""What about the $250 I sent you?""

So she wants me to send it back, but I reminded her once again that she owes me over $3,000. She got a bit defensive telling me “I get that, but the $250 was to cover part of my half of July” and leaving the room in the middle of talking to me. In my opinion, I don't see why I should send it back when she already owes me so much. 

Part of me doesn't give a fuck about giving back the $250. Part of me is tempted to be petty & send her $10-15 every week to pay it off the same way she had been sending me these smaller payments but never fully paying me back. But, I know the most mature thing is to just send it back. I never thought I'd be in a situation like this & I genuinely don't wanna continue to live with her or (even worse) be friends with her anymore.

AITA for not repaying her?

It was a little getaway for 2 days and was our first trip out of state together. I ended up surprising him when we got there with really close seats. For context, I’m also in school and working 2 jobs with no financial support from anyone so it was really hard for me to swing this. We ended up being at the concert so late that we weren’t able to do anything after besides go to the hotel and go to sleep.

This kind of caught me off guard because I thought we were going to do something fun before we headed home (we talked about this for weeks.) I mentioned us sitting down for breakfast at a place I’ve been begging him to try and he didnt really seem all that excited so I said we could just go through a drive thru. Then, we passed a shopping center, where I had also mentioned wanting to go and he just kinda laughed it off. So at this point I’m a little irritated, I went above and beyond to do something special for him and this is the thanks I get.

So on the way home, I just stayed to myself and didn’t talk very much. Eventually he had asked what was wrong so I told him, at this point we had already made it back to our home state so it was too late for us to turn around and do anything to make up for the time we just lost.

I was so frustrated I started crying and asked him to just take me home. I feel so defeated and invisible. Am I being selfish? I just want to feel like I also matter in my relationship.

I hadn’t planned on anything because I really don’t have a big enough friend group here to expect multiple people to show up, but she really pushed that we should do something, since it was a milestone birthday for me.

I was disappointed and hurt, and said I wasn’t a fan of football and planned to just do something for my birthday. She apologized and said because she had a uni friend coming to town that weekend, she was hoping to see the game with the group, and she would try to come after. 

Anyway, the game was moved to the Sunday, so she no longer had conflicting plans, so I asked again if she was going to make it since it’s a popular bar we’re going to and they need to know exactly how many people are coming. She then said because her friend was in town, she was going to do something with him, and maybe if she had time she would try to make it.

My wife isn't homophobic, but this took her by surprise. After Alice went to bed my wife asked me why I hadn't told her about Atlas' 'situation'.

33,1dqtasj,AITA For commenting out loud that I can see why my “cousin” doesn’t have friends?,"(Throwaway and fake names for privacy)



My (16F) parents have been friends with “Kelly” (\~50’sF) for so long that I call her my “aunt” and her daughter “Brooke” (\~14F) my “cousin.”



Brooke has always been kinda weird. I still tried to be friendly and talk to her, but it always turned into a dead end. When we were 12/14 I actually l caught her making fun of me in a group chat behind my back, which pretty much sealed the deal for me that she’s just a crappy person.



(I would have confronted her about it if she actually tried to talk to me, but that never happened, so I’ve just avoided her since then.)



My sister “Anna” (19F) told me yesterday that she heard Kelly saying she’s worried because Brooke doesn’t really have friends. Kelly was saying that Brooke asks her to be picked up whenever the library is closed because she doesn’t have anyone to sit with in the cafeteria.



I told Anna that if Kelly acts the same way at school that she does with us then I can see why she doesn’t have friends. It’s mean but still true. She clearly has poor social skills and isn’t a nice person to begin with. Someone like that who makes no effort to change probably isn’t going to have friends.



Anna told me I was a jerk and judgmental for saying this because you never know the full story of someone else’s life. Anna said it was possible that Brooke was bullied from a young age and that’s why she has poor social skills or she’s acting out from her own hurt. Anna told me I should apologize to Brooke.



I am refusing because I may not know the full story but I feel safe in making a logical assumption based on what I’ve seen and experienced from her. Just because someone is a victim of bullying doesn’t automatically mean they’re an angel themselves, if Brooke’s actually being bullied at all. Besides, it’s not like I went up to Brooke and told her she deserved to be friendless, so I don’t see what I have to apologize for. AITA?

So for the last six months we have been living in D's home, so has D's boyfriend and D's children from someone else.

Now, the fridge has normally been a free for all between the six of us. Ill buy things, my wife will buy thing so will S and D. Everyone eats what is in the fridge and functions like a normal family. Ill point out this is Eastern European family so the idea of not sharing food or sharing anything else in the fridge is a huge no no.

S and D broke up and things were still great and shared.

Of course me and my wife ate that food, and drank the milk as normally that's what we do. We will buy milk or other things and put them in the fridge and others take.

S comes home one day and secretly gets into it with D. We are not there but later D comes to us and tells us that we should have our own food. That we should share the fridge but one section for us and one section for them. Which is a huge shock because id never imagine a mother telling her daughter that she cannot have any food in the fridge.

The mother said that she cannot say anything to him now because she has almost money and that he pays for all the products. She makes more money then him but is self employed doing projects so she just needs to find a new project.

This has caused for her to start being nosy towards our home life aswell, with good intentions but quite invasive.
 
Today she visited us and asked me if I wanted for her to install at my house or for me to install at hers after giving birth to my baby... needless to say, I don't want to move to her house nor her to be staying all day at mine. Of course I would love for her to help us and be with her grand daughter a lot but I will need privacy and time to recover,  and don't want to hear anyone's opinion on anything regarding my child's nursing but my boyfriend's. 

Would I be the asshole if I tell her to back of? She is helping her son financially since he was finishing a degree, we move to a new town and he is gonna look for a job once paternity leave ends because no one is gonna hire him with a baby being born in a month (paternity leave is paid and mandatory in our country). 

INFO: it's not like my BF is a lazy ass. He had a job, the place shut down so WE as a couple decided that he should study the technical degree that he always wanted buy couldn't bc of his family. I got pregnant bc I had a terrible hormonal imbalance caused by the ton of meds I had to take after I got sick because of the severe abuse I was suffering at my workplace. I still have a pretty decent income and we both have savings, so we decided to have the baby even though she is coming 3 or 4 years sooner than planned. His mom is indeed helping HIM, not me, I have my own money. ",0.0,0.024008095264434814,0,1
39,1dqsguq,AITA for refusing to move out of my room for my stepbrother?,"I (17F) live with my mom and her husband, Dave. They got married two years ago, and Dave has a son, Jack (19M), from his previous marriage. Jack lives with his mom but visits us every other weekend and during school breaks.

My mom and I have lived in our house for as long as I can remember. When Dave and Jack came into the picture, I had already staked my claim on the biggest bedroom (other than the master) because it’s been mine since I was little. Jack usually stays in the guest room, which is smaller but perfectly fine.

A few months ago, Jack’s mom moved to another state for work, and Jack decided he wants to stay with us full-time to finish his last year of high school. Dave thinks it’s a great idea and that it’ll be good for us to bond more as a family. I was on board until Dave suggested that I move into the smaller guest room so Jack can have my room.

His reasoning? Jack is older and needs more space for his stuff, plus he’s not used to sharing a bathroom, and the guest room doesn’t have an en-suite. I was really upset by this. I’ve decorated my room just the way I like it, and it’s my personal space. I told them I didn’t want to switch rooms and that Jack should take the guest room since he’s the one moving in.

Dave wasn’t happy with my response and said I was being selfish. My mom is trying to stay neutral but keeps hinting that it would be nice of me to help Jack feel more at home. Jack hasn’t said much, but he did mention how cramped the guest room feels.

I feel like I’m being reasonable by wanting to keep my room, but everyone else seems to think I’m being difficult.

when i told her this she got a bit weird, she started saying how ""it was just one recipe"" and ""i should send it to her because one recipe won't matter""

i asked her if he ever sent her a recipe when he was alone, she said no, so i told her that's my answer, i'm sorry but i don't feel comfortable sharing it, and she got really angry with me, calling me an arsehole, and how i didn't deserve them at that i'm going to burn in hell for being aroace and genderfluid, i told her i'm definitely not giving her the recipe now and she can google one, then blocked and deleted her number

the more i think about it the more i feel terrible, should i have just given her the recipe? should i have just sent her one from google? should i have gone about this a different way?

Didn't tell my sister in law, cause why would I, it was just a car work. 

Got there, they were drinking beer and offers me one I said yes, drink two and my sister in law for some reason  appears  and drops one of my one of my nephews, and then she started texting, saying that I shouldn't be putting myself on my brother's and partner level drinking.

that what would happen if my brother's partner wife finds out, I will be causing to much trouble for them,.

 After i started working admittedly I didn’t have the time nor the energy to do it all by myself. Since she didn’t want to either our house got messy she would only clean when she brought her boyfriend over….in our one bedroom where i was also living.  Safe to say this made me uncomfortable.

She still brings her bf over 3-4 days a week..they sleep in the bed while I have to either sleep on the floor in the kitchen/dining/living room or on the janky sofa wich is beyond uncomfortable.
 The bf is not a bad guy he helps with groceries and whatnot but i wonder does he not think that maybe him always being there and me sleeping on the damn floor makes me uncomfortable in a house I pay rent in?

I made my stance clear and my answer was no. Which only brought more of the ""we're either a family or we're not"". My siblings stayed by my side and one of them was like well we're not an actual family so it's whatever, which only added fuel to the fire. I was then told I need to do this to restore family harmony and I should want to do this for my family. I told them I don't want to do this for them and I won't. They said it should be all three photos or none at all.

Dad and I hand to home to india after that. We took our new born brother w us too because she was hitting him as well. My dad fought so much for our custody and when he got it he was the happiest. He took care of us and I never had the void of not having a mom. He decided not to marry again as he was afraid the new woman wouldn’t take care of us. He was depressed tho. I was 15 when I started acting like a bitch. Id get so mad at dad when he wouldn’t allow for sleepovers. Id lie and go meet my boyfriend and i kept telling him that he was a shitty dad and I regret that so much. I was 17 when are relationship just started getting better and he passed away due to a brain stroke. I was shattered. I didn’t have any problem financially though cuz dad left a lot for me and my brother. I used to live with my dad , brother and grandmom who I love so much. when dad passed away, I had to move to his brothers place which was in another city in between highschool. I was missing my old life so so much. I did finish it tho. I and dad planned out my whole career I was so into law. I got into the top uni in the country. But dad wasn’t there to see that I got into our dream college. However my uncle didn’t let me go. I cried a lot but nothing changed.

He joined me in an all girls engineering college where we aren’t allowed to carry phones not even in the hostel. We had a dress code and wardens who treated us like shit. I went into depression and started taking pills. I did carry my phone and use it secretly though. I always had a need to talk to a guy for some reason. If smtng ended, I’d talk to someone different. I just coudnt stop. Maybe I was vulnerable and always wanted some male attention and affection. My uncle was tracking my calls and he’d threaten everyone I spoke to. I still couldn’t stop talking to them though. When I’m back home(his place) from college, he wouldn’t allow me to go out or meet my friends . After 2 years I had enough. Seeing all my friends from my city really got to me. Today I wanted to run away. He even changed my brother who now thinks I’m a slut. I didn’t want to sacrifice anything for him anymore and decided to leave. My grandmom is only alive for me but I didn’t even consider her feelings and went to the airport. She came till there and started crying so I had to cancel the plan. I’m 20 F and I’m very irresponsible and I know I can’t take care of ehr of my own.

49,1dqr7x6,AITA for being snippy with my mother while buying bras?,"I have a sensory processing disorder that makes me particularly sensitive to bras. I only have a few bras I am able to comfortably wear and it’s only on good days. Shopping for bras is a very frustrating thing for me.

Once at the store she tried to show me multiple different bras, all of which I quickly (and in her defense rudely) shut down due to the way they were made or due to a lack of support. She asked me to explain what was wrong with them, but explaining why a piece of fabric in a certain place makes me want to peel my skin off is very hard to describe to someone who doesn’t have the same issue.

50,1dqqtup,AITA if I made my gf cry and return $300 worth of stuff for our house?,"My gf (33) and I (35) bought a house together in January this year. The guy before us had lost all the keys for the house and only had a numbered keypad for the front door. We knew it wasn't going to be secure, so we needed to change the lock key.

My gf and I talked about putting locks on other doors as well, but we never talked about what we should use for them. I have a lot going on so I haven't brought it up, but my gf has here and there with these different ideas. She rarely talks about it at a time when I'm mentally available (to be fair, I'm rarely mentally available), so to me we weren't there yet. We still have other things we need to do, and that should be an easy fix.

So in my head, because we're in a legal battle over latent defects in the house, we both have health issues and need to find family doctors because Canada's health system sucks, I just found out I might have cancer and liver problems, also I might have a broken toe, she has been on sick leave with no pay so we also have money issues, mental health issues, AND I just got a new project at work... yeah. It's been hell. So I figured we would keep this simple and cheap and get to it when we could.

Well my gf decided she would go spend $300 on a bunch of stuff (Phillips hue motion sensors for another 60$ she spent on RGB LED Phillips hue light strips for the stairs, something called the wave mini, a brand new touch pad deadbolt that needs 4 AA batteries just to work, and a smart lock with control from anywhere (eufy security? I don't even know)). She didn't talk to me about any of it, except the motion sensor but she didn't tell me how much it would cost or ask if it was a good time to buy it (by the way... I make more money so I pay 65% of everything. Also I'm fully responsible for the budget because she finds talking about money stressful. But she costs 52% of our costs without counting these random spending sprees).

So I said that's not okay. She can't spend money like that. She spent 300$ (so 195$ of my money) without telling me what she was buying, nor making sure we can spend that now with everything else costing us money, nor did she ask my opinion about what we needed.

So when she showed me the stuff, I refused to accept any of it and asked that she return it. I said I think manual normal key locks are cheaper and more secure and that we don't need bells and whistles right now and that she should return it. She tried to explain but I shut her down because I think buying stuff like that just isn't ok.

So she cried. And I want her to return it all. And we will need to make decisions together from now on.

-EDIT-
She says I'm treating her like an enemy and that I should be grateful because she tried to handle it herself to lighten the load on me. I said thanks for trying to help but it's way more stress for me to have to worry that someone I have a joint bank account with will spend both our money without looking at our budget and without talking to me.

AITA?

***UPDATE***

So. Thanks to y'all in the reddit community, I have much more clarity. She should have talked to me about spending that much money, BUT. We need to fix the locks. We've needed to fix them for 7 months. I'm almost never mentally available to talk about this stuff. So if she hadn't done something, it would never have gotten done. So I thanked her and I apologized for making it impossible for things to get done these days. We need to find a way to communicate better so that I don't have to worry about our money problems all by myself. It's too much of a burden both mentally/emotionally when on top of it, the pressure to pay for most of our expenses is on me. She can't make all the right choices when she doesn't understand what we can afford. I need her help with this. To be fair, I have tried to show her the budget since I made it in January and she refused. I think this shows how important it is that she understands what we have. We need that shared clarity and communication because we need to find a way to split tasks between us and I need to be able to trust her and rely on her. We shouldn't have to wait for me to have mental energy to talk about stuff like this and to get it done. Y'all are right. This is about home security. It's very important and I'm the a-hole for not appreciating the fact that she made the first move. I should have appreciated the effort she made that I did not make one single time in 7 months.

She's basically obsessed with him, and doesn't even think about how he might be toxic for her. Me and a couple of other friends have been trying to get her to see why he's bad for her but she never listens and always ends up going back to him. He insults her, ridicules her in front of his friends, roams around with other girls and detaches whenever he feels like it, without any explanation.

She said that it hurt her when I told her to stay away from him, and it would be best if we didn't talk about her relationship. Basically she told me to not interfere in her love life and that she would die without him so I shouldn't waste my breath trying to convince her otherwise. 

A couple months later, she came to me crying once again about how her bf blocked her on all social media and wasn't talking to her with no explanation. This time, instead of comforting her and telling her she'd be better off without him, I stayed quiet and said that I wasn't going to be available for her emotionally when it came to her relationship, because she told me to.

When I was 9, our parents separated for eight months. Our mother spiraled during it. She pretty much just slept when she wasn't working. My siblings at the time were 2 and 3 and I spent a lot of time with them, made sandwiches for us at dinner time, got them to bed, tuck them in, and always waking mom up or calling dad to come take care of them.

They got back together but when I was 13 dad died. Mom spiraled worse then before. She worked, slept, and was gone most the night especially on weekends. I did everything for my siblings at that point and when I was 15 I was able to work some  weekends just to help pay for extras for us. It went on like that until I was 18 and left right after graduating high school. That seemed to be the kick in the ass mom needed to get her shit together.

I have since done therapy and mended my relationship with her but aftermath is I just really don't want anything to do with kids now. The thought mentally drains me. 

My siblings have kids now and have wanted me to be involved since the first nibling was born 6 years ago. I don't ignore them, I show up for their parties, and I'm nice when talking to them but I don't draw out interacting with them. I don't act fake excited and I don't want to go to their events. I don't have them over my house despite them and the rest of my family always suggesting I do because they're convinced I'd be a 'fun uncle'.

When I was leaving my sister said I should take the kids sometimes because they're always asking about me and my stuff and suggested that she and BIL come too if it'd help. I told her no thanks. She asked why I refuse to be more present in my niblings' life because she remembers I was a lot of fun with her and our brother.

I told her it mightve been fun for her but I was doing what needed to be done to keep them happy but it's okay if they remember it differently because they were so young. It's just after that I don't want to be around young kids. She dropped it. 

Earlier today our Nan text to tell me no one would be upset if I skipped our cookout next week so I didn't get stressed out around all the kids. Was I wrong for telling her why I don't get more involved? 

Update: Just got off the phone with Nan after I text her earlier. It was a polite disinvite due to my sister telling her I don't want to be more involved with the kids because I am kidded out after raising them. Per Nan ""It's selfish to be full of piss and vinegar over doing for family and that's not [family name] way. Your nieces and nephews need you like sister and brother did, if you can't put the bad aside you don't need to be around the kids for now.

Update: Just got off the phone with Nan after I text her earlier. It was a polite disinvite due to my sister telling her I don't want to be more involved with the kids because I am kidded out after raising them. Per Nan ""It's selfish to be full of piss and vinegar over doing for family and that's not [family name] way. Your nieces and nephews need you like sister and brother did, if you can't put the bad aside you don't need to be around the kids for now. We don't always want to show up for family for whatever reason but we do it."" I'm going to talk to my siblings, especially sis, this weekend to clear this up.",0.0,-0.009873594157397747,0,1
54,1dqpmic,WIBTA - my masters program is being cheap as hell for a funding opportunity THEY offered,"I'm a grad student, and my university offers funding for students to attend an annual conference if they have a poster presentation accepted by the national honor society. Lucky me, mine was accepted! So exciting. Never been to a conference before and definitely haven't been funded to travel either!

Now, the thing about me (28) is I have been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit in the past, both within the budget hostels and airbnb splurges. I am fully capable of enjoying lower budget trips if I know what I'm getting myself into. However, after doing it often, I have come to know what I like and don't like when I travel - what I'd like to splurge or not splurge on, etc. I also just like to be in control of what those accommodations are going to be. I also work full time and don't get a ton of opportunities to travel anymore, so when I do, I don't mind slurging a little.

Back to this conference - In our budget, we allotted $2,530 total for registration, flights, and hotel reservations. Initially, I was told I'd have 6 days/7 nights paid for and would be able to list my preferences for the hotel options I was given... then, they changed it to 4 nights/5 days (I'll have to go to the airport immediately after the conference ends in the evening). In addition to having less nights to pay for, the flight costs ended up being half of what we budgeted for.

And yet, without asking which hotels I would've preferred, I just got an email confirming the hotel I'll be staying at, which just so happened to be the cheapest, lowest rated, and least convenient of all the options. With everything else added up, the cost went down to \~$1,500.

Keep in mind, they had funding for additional students but I was the only one selected by the honor society and am the first to be selected after a few years of no other students applying. And they WANT to have students selected because it's a bragging right for my program.

I was just expecting that because its, essentially, an ""honor"" for me to be accepted, and they advertised it as like ""for being given this opportunity, we'll treat you to this funding! where would you like to stay?! look at this big budget we have!"". But now it feels like, oop, just kidding just booked you the lowest tier option :) when they clearly could have afforded more than that. I just feel kind of deceived and I'd rather pay more out of my own pocket to give myself the experience I was hoping for.

It does make me mad that my hours have been cut but I start college in August so I don’t really see a point in finding a new job and working there for a month. I would have to lie at the interview too because no one is going to hire me if they know I’m leaving in the next month.

My parents are always telling me about places that are hiring and places that I should apply too. I’ll apply to these places just to make them happy sometimes I’ll even get interviews but I hate having to lie in these interviews.

I should also add that I am going on a cruise the week before I move into college. I also don’t tell them about the cruise. I never end up getting the job anyways though.

I am planning to move out asap, but it's taking a lot longer than I expected. My brother (39M) lives a few blocks away and he has always been the golden child.

My brother started leaving my niece with my parents for most of the day, unannounced and randomly. Many things happened in between and now my niece stays here every single day for most of the day. My brother already has hired someone to help with chores and the baby but decided to leave my niece with us so this person can focus on cleaning (he never does any kind of chores no matter what).

My parents were visibly annoyed at the situation, my dad used to complain to me on a daily basis asking me to talk with my brother or my mom. I have already stated my opinion to them and I think they are just enabling my brother to be irresponsible, of course this only meant I am now the heartless villain of the family.  My parents struggle a lot to take care of my niece, and I find myself watching her, carrying her, whenever they need to, which prevents me from doing other stuff. 

The problem is that I have already told them I won't be taking care of her, I have told them I can cook, clean, and do whatever they want but watching her. Mainly because I don't want to be a part of my life being dictated by my brother's whim and partly because I never chose to have children and I don't appreciate being forced in a position in which I have to give up my time to take care of her.

They proceed to struggle and I help anyway, which is never appreciated.  They usually shut down y every attempt to cook for everyone or do some chores since they claim I do it wrongly, now when the topic comes up, they say I don't help at all and do nothing.

60,1dqni4t,AITA for exposing my cousin's dump acc? ,"
Hi, I (17F) am posting this here because I am consumed by guilt of tattle-tailing. To give some context, 

I am close to all my cousins, both father and mother's side. Last month, one of my cousins (13F) was recently given her very own phone (she previously didnt have one and would just borrow my aunt's). She (my cousin) very quickly made various social media accounts and added all our relatives, etc.

Later on, I was followed on Twitter/X by an account I dont know. My cousin then also sent me a message telling me that it was her dump account and that she is only following select people who are dear to her. Now my cousin's account isnt private (idk why she didnt lock it) but true enough, she only follows 30 people (with 10 being only people she knows irl-- I am the only blood relative in it, and 20 other celebrities) and is only being followed by the 10 ppl who know her irl. 

Again, the whole account making thing was a month ago, and I am not active on X, I'm mostly on IG and Tiktok, but 3 days ago, I decided to snoop around on X just to see what I've been missing out on. I was scrolling on the app and saw this very problematic tweet my cousin made, which was something very homophobic. I decided to stalk her account to see that she has more problematic tweets, even throwing around the n word. I was also surprised to see her post pictures of herself that I think would be suggestive (Again, my cousin's account isn't private, so I was stressed and troubled to see these pictures because other ppl might follow her and see her other pictures). 

I didnt talk to my cousin about it, instead, I went straight to my parents, who then said that we have to tell my cousin's parents. My mom messaged my aunt and told her all about it. I saved screenshots that blurred out my cousin's dump acc username but my mom encouraged me to give her the actual username, so I had to.

My cousin got an earful from her parents, her phone was also taken away as a punishment, and she is grounded, but just today my cousin was able to message me-- telling me I was the worst person ever for exposing her account, especially since that account also contained tweets/rants about her daily life.  She claimed it was her diary, and i just took it away from her. She also said that, for my age, she did not think I was such a ""loser"" and a ""tattle-tale"". Her words cut me thoroughly, but I see her point as well. 

AITA?

Reasons i may be the a-hole:

I am close to all my cousins, both father and mother's side. Last month, one of my cousins (13F) was recently given her very own phone (she previously didnt have one and would just borrow my aunt's). She (my cousin) very quickly made various social media accounts and added all our relatives, etc.

Later on, I was followed on Twitter/X by an account I dont know. My cousin then also sent me a message telling me that it was her dump account and that she is only following select people who are dear to her. Now my cousin's account isnt private (idk why she didnt lock it) but true enough, she only follows 30 people (with 10 being only people she knows irl-- I am the only blood relative in it, and 20 other celebrities) and is only being followed by the 10 ppl who know her irl. 

Again, the whole account making thing was a month ago, and I am not active on X, I'm mostly on IG and Tiktok, but 3 days ago, I decided to snoop around on X just to see what I've been missing out on. I was scrolling on the app and saw this very problematic tweet my cousin made, which was something very homophobic. I decided to stalk her account to see that she has more problematic tweets, even throwing around the n word. I was also surprised to see her post pictures of herself that I think would be suggestive (Again, my cousin's account isn't private, so I was stressed and troubled to see these pictures because other ppl might follow her and see her other pictures). 

I didnt talk to my cousin about it, instead, I went straight to my parents, who then said that we have to tell my cousin's parents. My mom messaged my aunt and told her all about it. I saved screenshots that blurred out my cousin's dump acc username but my mom encouraged me to give her the actual username, so I had to.

My cousin got an earful from her parents, her phone was also taken away as a punishment, and she is grounded, but just today my cousin was able to message me-- telling me I was the worst person ever for exposing her account, especially since that account also contained tweets/rants about her daily life.  She claimed it was her diary, and i just took it away from her. She also said that, for my age, she did not think I was such a ""loser"" and a ""tattle-tale"". Her words cut me thoroughly, but I see her point as well. 

AITA?

Reasons i may be the a-hole:

61,1dqn4kq,AITA for getting snippy with my partner over a religious discussion?,"i, (18 f) and my partner (also 18 f) are Atheist and Buddhist respectively, it started off with a little video they shared which highlighted views with religion that i personally agreed with (that it is a cause for a lot of issues and should be taught to only people over a certain age) and they disagreed with because it included Buddhism and other eastern religions in it.  
i wrote a paragraph within the comment section about my opinion on why the creator was correct in her views and wrote a discussion with facts backing it up on both ends so that i could weigh out both sides (the fact research is important for this). when my partner woke up i texted her late and joked that i wrote a big thing on the social media video she sent. she did not like that because she got slightly irritated(i did not know why at the time)

when we actually started talking and i mentioned i found out there were extremists and different subsects of Buddhists within the religion just like all the other religions i read about for the discussion she got visibly angry and immediately left. she then returned and told me she was upset. when i asked why she said it was because of what i said.

it confused me as i had not gone into any detail about anything that may usually trigger someone nor did i shame the religion(ive been working on the way i perceive certain aspects of religion due to past trauma so i can be less stubborn on its views). i asked her if me telling her that i found out about extremists was something bad and she got upset again and left once more. when she returned i was starting to get irritated myself over how my phrasing (""i didn't know Buddhism had extremists, you learn something new every day"" repeated verbatim in a 'huh i genuinely didn't know that, that's interesting' tone)

im not sure if it was the phrasing or my tone that set her off but when she got back it was to her stating 'drop the topic' and that the topic was anything bad about Buddhism. she also stated that the relationship wont do well if i cant support her (this all is still due to the one sentence)

i said i do support her but i was just stating a fact i learnt for this discussion i wrote.

she got upset when i refused to allow her to help(as i was now upset myself she continued to assume i didint support her. ive stated i support her no matter what many times before, said to end the topic then continued on the topic HERSELF. when i tried to tell her to stop aswell she only got mad again.

the fight is still on and i need urgent help. i just dont know how to handle this in a way that dosent annoy her more or make me snippy from the 'in the moment' emotions or disrespect both our views.

am i the a-hole?

thank you everyone for the comments, it seriously helped. it also helped me understand her point of view. after i got the first few responses we talked things through and your opinions helped both of us.

a few things that are being misunderstood though. A: the post i was discussing on was NOT my partners('partner' because she's genderfluid) video, she just sent the link to said video and B: she wasn't saying she agreed that children should be forced religion onto them and she joined the religion when she was older so she knows a lot about it.

65,1dqmqge,AITAH for cleaning out my roommate's fridge drawer?,"I (36F) have been living with a coworker (43M) for a few years because I cannot afford my own place in an area with exorbitant living costs. Initially, our arrangement seemed ideal: I could stay rent-free in exchange for cooking and cleaning. However, things took a drastic turn.

When I first moved in, the house was immaculate, and I had my own space. His mother also lived with us initially, sharing household chores and cooking while he managed bills. It was a peaceful setup until she moved out to live with her new husband. From that point onward, the house began to deteriorate rapidly.

The day his mother left, my roommate started moving his belongings from his room to the common areas. Within weeks, the living room, kitchen, and even my room became cluttered with his hoarded items. His inability to part with anything escalated to the point where my own living space was compromised. Any attempt to tidy up or organize was met with hostility from him.

His mother, while unhappy with the situation, hesitated to intervene decisively due to her soft spot for her only child, who had a history of illness. Despite occasional threats to evict him, she never followed through. As a result, I found myself trapped in this chaotic environment until I could save enough money to move out.

The breaking point came recently when I discovered mold growing in his fridge drawer, which he hadn't cleaned since I moved in. Despite repeated discussions and even his mother's intervention, the mold persisted and began affecting the entire fridge, forcing us to discard food regularly.

Faced with the health risks and financial strain caused by constantly replacing spoiled food, I decided to take action. With his mother's approval, I cleaned out his drawer, removing year-old, liquefied hotdogs and containers of moldy substances. I sanitized the drawer thoroughly and replaced spoiled items to prevent further contamination.

When he discovered what I had done, he reacted violently, throwing the drawer across the kitchen and attempting to evict me. Fortunately, his mother intervened, supporting my actions and asserting her authority over the household. She declared her intention to begin eviction proceedings against him, insisting he move to the house he inherited from his father.

Despite her backing, he blames me for his impending eviction and accuses me of ruining his life. However, I firmly believe my actions were necessary to protect my health and ensure a livable environment in the home. AITAH for cleaning his fridge drawer?

One had a leash and was trying to grab the dog, the other was in the car. The dog did not want to be collected. 

I had to walk by, and as I approached the poodle trotted up to me. I work in an office, and was wearing a light-colored suit dress, so I was a little bit worried it would jump on me. Plus, as I life long runner, I know that even “nice” breeds like doodles can be aggressive. Plus, I’ll admit, I don’t really like dogs. So I didn’t want it to approach me. 

The dog came up to me and tried to jump up on me, but I put out a hand to deflect it and shouted “no,” so it didn’t manage to get its dirty paws on me, and trotted a few paces away. 

The guy grabbed it, no apology, and walked back toward the car. I said, in a very pissed off voice, “please control your dog.” He yelled at me “keep walking!” Then, he drove by me to flip me off and call me a bitch.

I know my tone was harsh, but I feel like letting your dog rush strangers is pretty antisocial, and my anger was justified. His reaction shows that he clearly thought I was being an asshole about.

She then says, “Well, my guests can park along the side and back of your driveway so you can still get in and out.” I said, “Again, I'm going to have to say no. I'm not comfortable with your guests on my property and the only light I have at night is my post light out front. It's very dark at night and I wouldn't want anyone to trip or get hurt.”

69,1dqm81e,AITA for not buying my little brother breakfast. ,"I (18F) woke up and saw that a known fast food chain had given me a ‘free breakfast item’ reward and that it was going to expire the next day if I didn’t use it. So I got out of bed, let my parents know where I was going and why, then went on my merry way. 

Once I got home, my mom saw me with the bag in my hand and said ‘Put your brother’s food on the table. He’ll eat it after he comes from the gym.’ I looked at her, very confused, and informed her that there was no food for my brother(14M). 

She was livid and asked how could I get food and not think of my brother. I was confused about where all this anger came from since this was the first time I had ever gotten food and not brought any back for my brother. 

No matter where I’m going I always get him something even if I don’t get my parents anything just because I want to. Since I was little, I would always get two of everything for both of us. The only reason I didn’t get him anything was because I didn’t intend to spend money. The food was free and I tried to explain that to her, but she would not listen.

I (18F) woke up and saw that a known fast food chain had given me a ‘free breakfast item’ reward and that it was going to expire the next day if I didn’t use it. So I got out of bed, let my parents know where I was going and why, then went on my merry way. 

Once I got home, my mom saw me with the bag in my hand and said ‘Put your brother’s food on the table. He’ll eat it after he comes from the gym.’ I looked at her, very confused, and informed her that there was no food for my brother(14M). 

She was livid and asked how could I get food and not think of my brother. I was confused about where all this anger came from since this was the first time I had ever gotten food and not brought any back for my brother. 

No matter where I’m going I always get him something even if I don’t get my parents anything just because I want to. Since I was little, I would always get two of everything for both of us. The only reason I didn’t get him anything was because I didn’t intend to spend money. The food was free and I tried to explain that to her, but she would not listen.

70,1dqlnse,AITA for refusing to help my younger sibling after how she has mistreated me and the family in the past ,"Background story: so I have moved out and am living with other housemates. 

My younger sister (27) is still living with the parents. She has been pretty spoiled when she was younger and is still now. Still has not got her drivers license. Rarely if ever cleans up after herself so family is forever washing up dishes after her, cleaning the house after her. Rarely helps with cleaning bathroom, toilet, etc. 

The parents are going on holiday for a few weeks and have asked if I can look after her while they are away. They want me to move back to their place for a few weeks so I’m available there to cook for the both of us, and can drive her to and from school and work. 

I said I can help out from time to time but not every day. Then they suggested why doesn’t she move in with me as the place I am living in now is just less than 10 minutes by bus to her school. And it’s 15 minutes drive to her workplace. 

The parents house is about 90 minutes bus ride to the school and 20 minutes bus ride to her work. She starts school early at 8 or 9am and sometimes does not finish work till 8pm or later. 

Now I feel this is stepping the line. Not only am I giving up my time and effort but also my comfort and having to share a bed.  Like I mentioned before she is a bit of a slob and doesn’t clean up after herself. 

And not only that she is not very grateful i.e. one time my dad asked her for petrol money for all the trips he was making to take her to work. He said you are spending so much on Uber eats. You may as well give me some petrol money. She got really angry about it. 

So i mentioned these details to my parents and they were not happy about it saying I’m not a good older sibling. Look at x’s daughters who are going on holiday together for a few days. Well I said look she is not grateful about it. So why bother. They said look if you help her then she will help you. 

Look mom had an accident and was unable to drive for a few months. She only visited once and that was it until mom was useful again for getting lifts. 

And that time you asked me to follow her to the city to look after her when she was hanging out with friends and she literally ditched me. 

After so many of these types of scenarios with her it has left a really bad taste in my mouth. I don’t want to be cleaning up her mess in the sharehouse. better for her to stay alone at the parents house and she can clean up after herself. … or leave the garbage to rot.

We’re not close. Rachel’s always been rude to me. Before my husband met me, Rachel had a thing for him and tried to date him. He never reciprocated and then when we became official, Rachel started dating Chris.

Chris called asking if they can move in with us as they’re homeless. Chris and Rachel missed rent payments and got evicted and have been couch surfing with their three kids for the past month or so. My husband said he would need to talk to me first.

My immediate response was NO. Husband agreed although he felt bad. Chris’s family had been giving them money to make their rent payments and instead of paying rent, they used the money for other things. Chris works odd construction jobs and doesn’t make much. Rachel claims she can’t work because of ADHD.

Chris called back - husband apologized and said we don’t have the space - Chris tried to say we have 5 bedrooms. My husband clarifies that we don’t - we have 4, one of which is my office. Chris says he’s disappointed and he would’ve helped us. My husband says I WFH and need the house to be quiet. Chris says he doesn’t understand where we get the impression that their kids can’t be quiet and he’s offended. Rachel says we have the money and a big house to help but that we would rather see three kids end up on the streets because I’M greedy. I snap and tell her that her kids are not my responsibility and I’m not comfortable sharing my home with strangers. It’s not our problem that they mismanaged their finances and that maybe she shouldn’t have gotten her nails done every week and paid their rent instead. She responded that I don’t understand how hard they have it because I’m “privileged” and providing for three kids isn’t cheap - so I said maybe she should get a job and stop using ADHD as an excuse, and they should’ve thought of that before having kids and hung up.

Husband’s phone starts blowing up with calls from family members. He picks up Chris’s dad’s (Paul) call. Paul wants to know why we’re unwilling to help. I ask him why he and his wife haven’t opened their home as this is his son and grandkids after all. He says Chris/Rachel and the kids stayed for a week but their house is too small and it didn’t work out. I told him that we aren’t close to Chris/Rachel and have no obligation to them, and I suggested he and his wife reopen their home to their son and grandkids. He says they did open their home and now it’s our turn. I laughed and hung up.

So now my husband’s family thinks that we’re cruel and heartless. We also haven’t disclosed that I’m pregnant which is also a big reason (they’re anti-vax and I don’t want to be exposed), and I’ll be going on mat leave for a year as of January so we’re trying to save up.

72,1dql4fx,AITA for getting a 2nd job?,"I'm sorry for the long post.

I (19NB) currently live with my dad (50M), step mother Barbra (53 F), and Barbra's mother (75 F). For a little bit of context, I lived with my mom til I was 16 when my dad got custody of me. Before having custody of me and during the custody battle, Barbra was very pushy of my father getting custody of me. During the custody battle Barbra turned me into a slave. While my father was at work, Barbra would force me to sit outside in the heat for hours helping with the yard, do all the dishes, plus all the cleaning. I did all the laundry. During this time, my dad didn't know what all was happening.

Well due to some stuff happening all three of us had to move into Barbra mothers house. Well everything was the same, but I got treated so much worse and I do everything now, cleaning, laundry, cooking, tending the dogs. If you think of it I do it. (On the side note: I don't have to do my dads laundry, I just do it.) At one point I was buying all the groceries and I wouldn't even have time to just eat because I was doing other things. Almost every night I'm eating my dinner while doing dishes because if I don't I'll lose sleep that I can't afford. On top of this I'm a manager of a fast food place I work there 35 to 45 hours a week and I just got a part time job to help with moving costs. (On another side note, Barbra takes me back and forth to work while I'm trying to get my drivers licenses.)

Back to the reason for the post, with all the cooking, cleaning, tending to the animals, working, getting the stuff my father and I have to have to move, Barbra and Barbra mom keep making me feel like it is my responsibility to do everything. They also treat me like complete shit. I get maybe 4 hours of sleep at night if I get everything done that I need done.

Barbra mom doesn't work. All she does is sit and watch tv while being on her phone. She will throw a fit when I leave to go to work and act like I'm disturbing her while shes watching her tv. She also yells at my animals if they make even a peep of noise. They don't stop when she yells but I don't want my dogs around someone who's just gonna yell at them.

Barbra on the other hand has a part time job, (works 20 to 25 hours a week), all she does is lay in her bed and bitch and complain. She will bitch at me for not doing what I need to do all the way to work and all the way home. She will complain about never having gas, but when I give her gas money she buys other stuff with it.

My dad can't do anything because he works 14 to 16 hours a day as well. As soon as he gets extra money, my step mom just happened to not pay a bill so hell have to pay it.

I feel like I'm in a losing situation, I would just go and get an apartment myself, but I can't leave my animals or my dad. We bought a shed that we are turning into a house, it its taking money and time and time isn't what I have. I feel like i'm in such a lose lose situation.

75,1dqkq3u,AITA for leaving our house chat?,"*TLDR: AITIA for leaving my house group chat, leading to them calling me emotionally abusive?*

I (M29) have lived in a shared house with 3 others for around 2.5Y. We have Sam (F27) and Ben(M26) since the start. Living together Sam and I were pretty close. She has OCD and I have ADHD. I have coping mechanisms but not always perfect.

Lucy (F31) moved in 1.5Y ago, she’s bubbling & friendly. We got on pretty well for the first but Lucy & I are a bit different, she is a party person. In social scenarios like raves she does drugs. Sam and Ben also, but more frequently after Lucy moved in. I’m a more of a pub kind of person. I have no issues with drug use, I just see them less, plus I'm busy myself with dance.

A few issues I had with Lucy:

* She angrily renegotiated her rent 4 months in after finding the room was cheaper before
* We've cleared up after her parties, once she left the garden in state for over a month plus random people on our sofa
* She hosted a bbq and assumed I'd cook, no word of thanks

Despite this Sam and Lucy's social lives entwined. Sam started to complain about house issues, there’s four of us + partners so accountability is hard. I believed wrongly I was mostly not the source of this.

That bring us to the incident in question. Lucy and I have a brief spat about the state of the house on our chat. She says she's monitoring a takeaway container on the side. Sam defuses this. I then manage to lose my phone that night. I manage to message Sam on FB to let her know. I then get locked out of FB so just email.

This was show week (Sat), I'm away. Tues: I have a working phone again. I boot up and a slew of messages come through in our group chat. A lot of anger. Eventually a photo. It’s not takeaway but a ready meal tray. I’m embarrassed because it’s me. I came home to our house late that evening, bin the tray and then read the chat. I'm embarrassed, frustrated, upset. Frustrated as this tray was by our kitchen bin, it was an accident. In a stupid moment I leave our group chat. I’d been having a rough time with an ex being verbally abusive over messenger recently

Later that week after Sam + I chat I rejoin and send an apology. Lucy asks for a house meeting so I agree. Lucy said AITA for:

* emotional abusive (stonewalling) for leaving the chat
* Not apologising once in my message
* Sam also explains they were worried about me not paying rent etc

I'd also had overheard Lucy admit she hadn't read my message fully and that she thinks I barely do the basics. I was shaken. But decide to just apologise and also agree that we need to spend more time as a house (absence breeds resentment)

I have now repaired my relationship with Sam. I'm just reflecting a little:

* I read my message and I apologise explicitly 5 times
* There's been a box of Lucy's stuff in our front room for 2 weeks now and the hypocrisy isn't lost

So AITA for leaving the chat?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-28,"AITA for leaving our house chat? *TLDR: AITIA for leaving my house group chat, leading to them calling me emotionally abusive?*

I (M29) have lived in a shared house with 3 others for around 2.5Y. We have Sam (F27) and Ben(M26) since the start. Living together Sam and I were pretty close. She has OCD and I have ADHD. I have coping mechanisms but not always perfect.

Lucy (F31) moved in 1.5Y ago, she’s bubbling & friendly. We got on pretty well for the first but Lucy & I are a bit different, she is a party person. In social scenarios like raves she does drugs. Sam and Ben also, but more frequently after Lucy moved in. I’m a more of a pub kind of person. I have no issues with drug use, I just see them less, plus I'm busy myself with dance.

A few issues I had with Lucy:

* She angrily renegotiated her rent 4 months in after finding the room was cheaper before
* We've cleared up after her parties, once she left the garden in state for over a month plus random people on our sofa
* She hosted a bbq and assumed I'd cook, no word of thanks

Despite this Sam and Lucy's social lives entwined. Sam started to complain about house issues, there’s four of us + partners so accountability is hard. I believed wrongly I was mostly not the source of this.

That bring us to the incident in question. Lucy and I have a brief spat about the state of the house on our chat. She says she's monitoring a takeaway container on the side. Sam defuses this. I then manage to lose my phone that night. I manage to message Sam on FB to let her know. I then get locked out of FB so just email.

This was show week (Sat), I'm away. Tues: I have a working phone again. I boot up and a slew of messages come through in our group chat. A lot of anger. Eventually a photo. It’s not takeaway but a ready meal tray. I’m embarrassed because it’s me. I came home to our house late that evening, bin the tray and then read the chat. I'm embarrassed, frustrated, upset. Frustrated as this tray was by our kitchen bin, it was an accident. In a stupid moment I leave our group chat. I’d been having a rough time with an ex being verbally abusive over messenger recently

Later that week after Sam + I chat I rejoin and send an apology. Lucy asks for a house meeting so I agree. Lucy said AITA for:

* emotional abusive (stonewalling) for leaving the chat
* Not apologising once in my message
* Sam also explains they were worried about me not paying rent etc

I'd also had overheard Lucy admit she hadn't read my message fully and that she thinks I barely do the basics. I was shaken. But decide to just apologise and also agree that we need to spend more time as a house (absence breeds resentment)

I have now repaired my relationship with Sam. I'm just reflecting a little:

* Was I made to feel I was all the house problems? - I found mess all the time just didn't voice it
* I read my message and I apologise explicitly 5 times
* There's been a box of Lucy's stuff in our front room for 2 weeks now and the hypocrisy isn't lost

While we were kayaking my one friend also 25F got out her wireless waterproof speaker and asked if one of us could connect to the aux as she didn’t want to. I connected and she gave me the speaker as it would disconnect if it stayed on her boat. Halfway along the route it died and we didn’t think anything of it. Near the end we were all 6-9 drinks in and I realized the speaker wasn’t in my boat. I looked through everything when we were done and decided that it was lost. While I didn’t flip on the route we did go over a couple of rapids and I think it fell out. 
Now the friend who gave me the speaker to hold on to wants me to buy her a brand new one ($190) value as she wants a certain brand. I originally did feel bad and went on Amazon and found a clip on waterproof speaker that was the brand she wanted for $40. I sent it to her and asked if this was good and she said she would think about it. 

A couple of days later we were all hanging out and she brought up the speaker and said she talked it over with her boyfriend and she wants the type she had as they listen to music at home. I said that I felt bad but it wasn’t entirely my fault as she brought it on the river and didn’t make sure it was tied down. I also didn’t do anything malicious with it like throw it, it was an accident. While we were having this argument my one friend chimed in and said that my friend was being ridiculous that she got the speaker as a gift 5 years ago and if we looked at it like a resell value she would of gotten maybe $20 for it. My friend said she also used to have the same speaker brand and it randomly died a year ago so her speaker probably wasn’t far behind and she also tried to show her other speakers that she had that were a 1/3 of the price that worked much better. The owner of the kayaks even said that you don’t bring anything on the river that you care about too much because it could always get lost. 
 She responded nastily and said that she was disappointed and that it was shitty because that’s how she listens to music and that if I’m not going to give her $90 then don’t give them anything at all. She was very aggressive and very entitled. 

In the end I ended up venmoing her $50 but she didn’t even say thank you or acknowledge it. It makes me want to not hang with her and I think it’s super rude to not acknowledge the payment. She’s calling me an asshole while others are saying I shouldn’t have given her anything.

80,1dqjdn1,AITA for refusing to give my brother his car back,"First post and on mobile so sorry if post is a mess. 

I 25f and my brother 22m are currently not speaking to each other due to this situation. Got to start from the beginning, my mom has helped all of my siblings purchase a car. She bought one for my older sister, for me, and for my brother. The one I got was no good and after putting 4000 of my own to repairs had to junk it, me and my partner ended up buying a used vehicle from a dealership that lasted us a while. My partner and I both work full time jobs and at that time had a child, sharing 1 vehicle became very difficult but we managed. 

Meanwhile my mom purchased my brother his first vehicle for $500 a blue Toyota Yaris, he buys tires and rims for the car but then refuses to get his permit/license and the car ends up sitting out there for more than a year. He ended up saying he didn’t like it/wasn’t his style etc. My mom ended up offering it to me she said she felt bad that I was struggling while this vehicle just sat there. I did the work fixed the title and had to put it under my name and my brothers name since he had already signed the title. Got inspection, emissions the plates everything to make it drivable all in the middle of COVID so I even had to mail things! I did tell my brother that if he ever needed I t back I would give it back since it was his (my mistake right here). 

Well guess what? 4 years later and now my brother is asking for the car back or for $2000. My situation has changed, I now have 2 kids and am now just down to the 1 vehicle. My partner lost his job and we sold his car to cut down our expenses. This vehicle is now my only vehicle I have maintained and had this vehicle for 4 years now. My brother also has 2 kids and also recently got fired from his job for stealing beer!! My mom supports my brother in everything, watches his kids, works and sends the money she earns to him, buys him food drives him around literally everything. He finally has decided to get a license even tho the doctors said he is partially blind and cannot drive, something him and my mom seem to be “forgetting”. 

Now he said I can keep the car (lol) just to pay him 2k for the rims he bought. The car is not even worth 2k and even tho I have a very small amount of money saved this would take a big chunk of my savings. I’m refusing to pay 2k or give the car back. my brother said it’s only fair since now he needs to buy a new car and my mom can’t afford to buy a new one on her own. The way I see it he is a grown ass man who actually just got a job, thanks to my mom, who now should be able to save up and purchase a vehicle of his own or go to a dealership like I did. But I’m second guessing myself and am not sure if I ata since technically it was his car. What do you guys think? Spoke to my older sister and she agrees with me but am looking for an outside opinion

And just like in real life, these various types should all have a chance to exist. Those seeking company can create guilds and communities whilst loners should be allowed to enjoy their more solitary play style.

Being a loner, what I usually do is try to find the most secluded little nook I can find, build a home and go about my business crafting and working on my skills etc. I still enjoy bumping into other players ""from time to time"" but wouldn't want to live next to them as it would force me to be social every time I log in. *""Hey how are you today? Any chance you could craft me some pouches? Wanna go to a dungeon?""*

Sometimes all you wanna do is log in, have a little bit of me-time, relax with some crafting and log off - ya know?

So I recently met a nice person in-game who I ""bump into"" from time to time and we have nice short little moments of roleplay. Then we move on to do whatever we were going to do originally. It's been extremely pleasant and just the right amount of social interaction from my part. We've bumped into each other 3 times now, so I barely know this person, but I could see this forming into a nice friendship over time.

Today they paid me a visit while I was busy crafting at my house. They presented me with a gift and asked if they could move next to me so we could become neighbors. In fact, they had already set up their empty plot close by (but hadn't built yet because they wanted to check with me first).

I think the person is nice and all but I'd much prefer merely bumping into them occasionally rather than seeing them almost every time I log on and having to exchange niceties. I had to be honest with them and explained about being a lone wolf etc and said that I'd rather not have any neighbors and specifically chose that spot to build to be alone. I also made it clear that it is not personal, but that I appreciated them asking if it was ok.

This person seemed to ""kinda"" understand, but I could tell their feelings were hurt. Of course, it's never nice to be rejected and most likely they had already formulated these plans in their mind about what great friends and neighbors we could become and how we could go hunting together etc.

Now I feel like such a meanie for rejecting their friendly proposal.

82,1dqizyh,AITA for not being there enough for my best friend when her grandmother died?,"A few months ago my “Best Friend” (22F) had told me her grandmother passed away, during this time, I (22F) was already going back and forth from work to the hospital because at the same time my own grandfather had a stroke and was in the ICU for a few weeks. I was slowly watching him deteriorate and I was in my own bad mental health state but I would still try to make her feel better. There was a time she called, but I was busy or not home, so I told her I’d call her back when I was free and for her to go take a shower, relax, and just get her mind off of it until I was home. I didn’t remember til later that day (because it was a chaotic day) that I was supposed to call her, so I did, and she didn’t answer. I texted, no answer. I called again, still no answer. Then she said she has her therapist to talk to because I would be working when she needed me. I told her I’m sorry and that I’m not on my phone while working and that’s why I’m taking long to respond. I also told her I was dealing with my own feelings and explained the situation through text and not once was she there to comfort me through my situation that I was going through with my grandfather. When my grandfather passed (on Christmas, a few days after her grandmother) she was already being distant, I texted the group chat to get my feelings out a bit and she simply said “sorry for your loss” in our group chat and never spoke to me again. She just ghosted me and every time I look back at the messages, I can’t seem to figure out what I did wrong or how I messed up. I understand I wasn’t 1,000% there for her but I tried when I was free. I also have my own life that I couldn’t put a pause on. I texted her back every time, called her back when I could, and tried to make her feel better by calming her down when she was breaking down. I just needed her to tell me it was going to be okay and she removed me on every social media platform she had me on. AITA?

A few months ago my “Best Friend” (22F) had told me her grandmother passed away, during this time, I (22F) was already going back and forth from work to the hospital because at the same time my own grandfather had a stroke and was in the ICU for a few weeks. I was slowly watching him deteriorate and I was in my own bad mental health state but I would still try to make her feel better. There was a time she called, but I was busy or not home, so I told her I’d call her back when I was free and for her to go take a shower, relax, and just get her mind off of it until I was home. I didn’t remember til later that day (because it was a chaotic day) that I was supposed to call her, so I did, and she didn’t answer. I texted, no answer. I called again, still no answer. Then she said she has her therapist to talk to because I would be working when she needed me. I told her I’m sorry and that I’m not on my phone while working and that’s why I’m taking long to respond. I also told her I was dealing with my own feelings and explained the situation through text and not once was she there to comfort me through my situation that I was going through with my grandfather. When my grandfather passed (on Christmas, a few days after her grandmother) she was already being distant, I texted the group chat to get my feelings out a bit and she simply said “sorry for your loss” in our group chat and never spoke to me again. She just ghosted me and every time I look back at the messages, I can’t seem to figure out what I did wrong or how I messed up. I understand I wasn’t 1,000% there for her but I tried when I was free. I also have my own life that I couldn’t put a pause on. I texted her back every time, called her back when I could, and tried to make her feel better by calming her down when she was breaking down. I just needed her to tell me it was going to be okay and she removed me on every social media platform she had me on. AITA?

We did everything together, 4-5 times a week, shopping, drinking, coffee catch ups, just chilling. Then me and my bf broke up and her bf was also being weird with her at that time. She seemed almost happy that me and him broke up (as at the time it was going to happen to her too…). Then whilst we were both broken up with we got closer, both went clubbing together and so on. Then my ex boyfriend started texting me again, and asked for a second chance. I decided to give him one and our problems were improving. She was checking my ex’s profile picture often despite not having his number in her phone (but through a group) , constantly asking me why are you texting him again. Then I saw a change in her. She left me out of our entire friendship group, posted it on social media, ignored my texts for 2 whole weeks on multiple occasions. She ordered the foods that I hate on purpose in restaurants for us all to share, threw the presents I bought her for her birthday on the floor, laughed at me, called me childish, spoke to me for 1 minute in 7 hours on her birthday party. She treated me like this for 3 months until the hurt started to fade and I started to grow stronger. 

Since this, and probably realising her other friends are not that nice after all- she has tried to reach out three times. All could be genuine but none are apologising or asking if anything is up. Every text has been after she has heard I’m on vacation, or after my other friends post that I’ve been with them recently on social media. It’s like she is obsessed with knowing about my life. 

2 times - both asking to meet up and I say no sorry I’m too busy. Both one month apart. She knows I hate ignoring texts or replying too slowly to other people but right now I’m conflicted. Both times when I said no, she immediately involved another friend to ask me to meet her. 


She said - how are you? I missed you! If you have time in the next month would be nice to meet.

I know she is capable of treating me badly,
 And I don’t want that back in my life. It’s been another 4 months since her last attempt.

84,1dqiux8,AITA for yelling at my husband for not putting my bike lock back where he found it?,"Long-time reader, first-time poster.

My husband and I both have E-bikes. I have the better lock, so my husband often borrows mine. The problem is, he NEVER puts it back where I had it. Sometimes I remember to check if my lock is on my bike before I leave, but sometimes I don’t. This means I often have to turn around and come back home to search for my lock, which has been the source of many arguments.

Recently, his bike broke, so we’ve both been riding my bike. Even now, he still moves my lock. Just this morning, I got all the way to the gym and realized my lock wasn’t attached to my bike. Due to time constraints, I missed my workout. When I got home, I said, “Someday I will have my own bike lock and it will stay right where I left it.” I was pretty mad and I may have added some extra spicy words in there. He thinks I should just check for the lock before I leave, and I think he should put it right back where he found it. He also says I shouldn't leave the lock on my handlebars as it is lying across some of the wiring and he's afraid it will damage it. (but who's the one with the broken bike?)

Now, I’m definitely buying another lock along with the parts for his bike so this issue will hopefully come to an end.

85,1dqiu8z,AITA for Being Frustrated with My Best Friend’s Kindness Being Taken Advantage Of?,"
I have a friend of 10 years who is incredibly kind, sometimes to a fault. I care deeply about them and know they're a genuinely good person. The issue is that their kindness often gets taken advantage of, and they struggle to set proper priorities in their life.

The Dog Situation:
One major issue is their co-worker, whom I'll call ""Austin."" Austin, 35, has a fiancée and has been homeless for about three years. He asked my friend, let’s call them “Bobbie,” to watch his senior dog until he finds a place to live. Initially, I thought this might be a temporary arrangement, maybe a year at most, but it’s become a long-term situation.

Austin’s priorities are questionable. Instead of finding a home for himself and his dog, he spent over $1,000 on last-minute tickets to EDC and Coachella in the same year he asked Bobbie to watch his dog. This money could have gone toward a deposit for an apartment or any type of shelter. To make matters worse, Austin earns over $100,000 annually due to his seniority at work, and even their co-workers believe he’s taking advantage of Bobbie.

Bobbie already has a dog, and the two dogs do not get along. The tension got so bad that Bobbie’s dog bit their partner while they were trying to separate the dogs. Despite this, Austin took his dog back for just one night before returning it. Now, Bobbie keeps Austin’s dog in the bathroom all day to prevent further conflict. I feel terrible for the dog, as this isn’t a suitable living situation.

Bobbie’s partner is also fed up and even broke up with them, partly due to this situation.

I’m at my wits' end and unsure what to do. My partner suggests ending the friendship, but I’m conflicted. I believe that one day, Bobbie will achieve their goals, like getting their license, GED, and a better job. It’s hard to watch my best friend struggle because of their poor choices and the people they surround themselves with. I know I can’t control their actions, but I just want them to be on the right path. It’s been over five years of this, and their constant complaints about their life without taking action are really starting to bother me.

Growing up she was abusive towards me and when my parents got divorced when I was 17 I went no contact with her for about a year. We’ve started having semi regular contact again and while our relationship is getting a bit better it’s tense and uncomfortable for me. My mom is a narcissist so I know she believes she did nothing wrong and I’ve accepted that I will probably never get an apology from her so I need to sort out how I feel about her and what happened in my childhood by myself.

Growing up my dad was not perfect but he was a shield for me. He always supported me and was the complete opposite of my mom. I watched him work long hours to support me and my mother (my mother didn’t work) and then come home and take care of the house (my mother also didn’t cook, clean, etc). When I got older I stepped up but that’s not really relevant lol.

My point is my dad is a good dad and the only person in my family I have a healthy relationship with because my mother turned everyone else in my family against me (just said I was an evil child and would say and do mean things to her all the time and that it was my fault our family was falling apart).

When I was 16 I saw this TikTok where this girl got one of her parents hand writing tattooed on her and that idea always stuck with me. A little bit ago I asked my dad if he could send me a photo of him writing the words “I love you” and I planned to get that tattooed on my arm.

And I say when because I’m not going to hide a tattoo for my whole life lol. But at the same time when she finds out it will become “oh I’m sorry I forgot your dad was your favorite and you hate me”, “well I’m just a terrible mother aren’t I?”, and “maybe we should stop speaking because it’s so obvious how you feel about me.”

I’ll be 100% honest yeah my dad is my favorite because he actually treated me like a human growing up and didn’t remind every day that he didn’t want me, or tried to kick me out of house when I was older.

I'm quite proficient in Japanese and have a thorough understanding of the city. Last month, a friend (22F) of mine from the US traveled to visit Japan and to see me. She was rather excited about her trip to the country since she had never been here before.  
  
I told her before she arrived that I would try to hang out with her when I could, but that most of the time I would be busy with work. I also recommended a few tourist attractions and offered her some basic advice on Tokyo. I believed that would be plenty to get her going.

When she first arrived, she felt overwhelmed by the city. After settling down in a hotel somewhere in Roppongi, she contacted me many times, asking for directions and assistance navigating the train system. I was in the middle of a huge assignment at work and didn't have time to walk her through every detail.  
  
I advised her to check out Google Maps and download several travel apps. She seemed irritated but agreed. Over the next three days, she called and texted me, undoubtedly struggling to get around and requesting assistance with translations and directions. I kept telling her that I was busy and that she should sort things out on her own. I even recommended she go on a guided tour if she was having so much problems.

She eventually stopped contacting me and got through the remainder of her trip on her own. When she returned to the US, she hardly talked to me and I could tell she was unhappy. She later told me that she felt abandoned and that I should have been more helpful given how well I knew the area.

The reason my brother cannot move with us is that my partner has a daughter (5f). And neither of us trust brother around her.

My dad is struggling with this decision and i know that i am pressuring him to move out, and leave my brother. I just really care about my dad and want better for him. Im not asking him to cut my brother out of his life, just dont want brother to know where im living.

91,1dqhs75,WIBTA for confronting my dad?,"Hello, I (15m) need your help in how to handle this issue. My dad (45m) constantly points out when he thinks I am eating too much at parties or get togethers. He does this in a way that makes everyone feel awkward and embarresed. For example, today family friends came over and we got pizza. I was eating with my friends when my dad says ""Don't you think that's enough, go easy on the pizza"". There was an awkward silence and my friends teased me for this afterwards. I hate this because it feels like everyone in the room thinks i am eating 10 slices and being a glutton. The thing is I don't even eat much, at most i eat 4 slices while others are eating full boxes. I am a little overweight but I play many sports and have a very active lifestyle. I would like advice on how to confront my dad.

93,1dqh1i6,AITA for not inviting my mum to my wedding? ,"Ok context here, I'm 31M, my wife 28F, we got married a few years ago in America. My parents are both in their 50s. 

A few years back me and my girlfriend started looking at houses, we already technically lived with each other as I moved in with her (staying at her dad's place) during COVID but technically this was us looking for our first place. During the entire time we were looking, my mum was desperately trying to convince me to buy a house in the town I grew up in, I wasn't against the idea but nothing suitable came up. Me and my girlfriend then found a place approx 20 minutes from where I grew up, we were excited and on the day we found out our offer was accepted I took my mum a drive to see my first house, this is where it really all started, my mum told me my house was ""in the wrong place"" that ""it's too far away"" and quite a few other odd comments e.g. an older guy walking a scottie dog was ""the local ned"". Anyway, I shrugged it off a bit even though it hurt, eventually spoke to her about it and said that it wasn't fair to do that to me to which I got a reply of ""I'll just not say anything then"". Fine whatever. 

A few months later, I've asked my girlfriend to marry me, sent a picture of the engagement ring to my mum and dad as I wanted to share my news as soon as possible and I got a reply from my mother saying ""what's that"". So we're then going to my parents house the next weekend for dinner (unrelated to the engagement) and the house has been decorated with engagement banners, I thought we'd maybe turned a corner, instead we walked in, said hi to everyone and it was just silence, no congratulations or mention of being engaged, just completely ignored. 

This then brings us to getting married, we aren't big party people and really don't like being the centre of attention at an event so we looked into going abroad, we told my mum this the one and only time she actually asked us then she scurried away to the kitchen straight after we asked. We eventually settle on where we want to go, I messaged my parents with a picture of our venue and told them that's where we've booked, looks amazing and that we want to have a dinner for family once we get back... My mum immediately left the WhatsApp group. 

We didn't outwardly invite anyone to our wedding but it wasn't closed either, we had zero expectations for anyone to spend a couple of hundred to come watch us get married, but on the complete flip side, when we told my wife's mum where we were going and she immediately said ""I'm there"" and was delighted for us. 

So now, I've not spoken with my mum for a couple of years, my dad has pretty much followed in the same way although I've technically not fallen out with him.

At that time, I was living with them and attended every treatment sessions, appointments and looked after her providing 24 hour care. Mind I was 28 and wanted to marry someone of my own choice. They wanted me to marry someone from India of their own choice and bring them to the U.K. I married the love of my life and they had disowned me.

Fast forward, the cancer returned and I went to see her again. My father was okay but she refused to see me. She even said to my sister that’s it’s her fault for telling me and bringing me here and she shouldn’t have, and if she does it again they will kick her out too. I left and have made the decision to not return ever again regardless of what happens now.

Throwaway/burner account because I think my friend or some of her family uses reddit.

My friend, whom I'll call Kate (14f), and I (15f) really wanted to go see a band in concert. It's one of our favorite bands and one of our biggest shared interests. We researched all concerts in a three or four state radius, and tickets ranged from $18.50 (resale) to $50.00. I have enough money for anything but the fifty-dollar option if I get only one ticket. However, my friend doesn't even have enough money for the eighteen dollar option. I figured no worries; this is our trip, and I don't mind paying for both of us as long as she pays for the next one. She agreed so we just needed someone to take us.

My friend's godmom, who I'll call Sam, said she would take us if she could go too. We asked if I would have to pay all ticket costs, and Sam said I most likely would. I figured no problem; she's driving, so it's only right I pay for her ticket. Well, we got to a few hours ago, and Sam said she wants us to go to the fifty dollar one. She knew it was $50 per ticket, and she also knew it's fifty dollars per ticket I don't have.

After that interaction, I started thinking how I could get basically the same seats if I went somewhere else with someone else. I know my biological mom likes the same music I do, and if I asked nicely and covered her ticket, she would probably take me to one of the cheaper options (the $18.50 one). None of the concerts in a three or four-state radius are until August, and we obviously haven't bought tickets yet, so would I be the asshole if I canceled the plans with my friend and her godmom, and went with my bio mom instead?

Edit/update

I would like to make an edit after something new happened in the group chat. So, I just woke up, and it's around one PM when I started typing this up. Around like ten in the morning, my friend and her godmom started talking in the chat about completely new plans that I didn't expect, and I definitely can't afford that option. Sam said that she found different ticket options at the venue, while we would be buying better seats. I can't afford $70 per person, a hotel for two nights, and zoo tickets. So I guess now I'm asking, WIBTA if I told them I don't like how they're purposefully choosing options that they KNOW I can't afford, and i just go with someone else?

Also, I do have proof, and I'm willing to give screenshots if necessary.

Also if my writing is awful ignore that, im still tired and my brain isn't all there yet

Edit/update 2

Based on the responses I've received so far, I think what I might do is tell them that I can't afford what they wanted to do, and that I am more than willing to try and get more money so all three of us can get the $18 dollar tickets. However, there's no way I can afford the zoo, a hotel, and tickets that are $50/70 dollars each. There's really no need for a hotel because the concert is at 7:00 p.m., and we could get back the same night. At the same time, going to the zoo is more expensive than going to our local one, and I could take them to our local one on a different day.

She just said that she doesn't know if her friends will be free so it would probably be easier to move our plans. I just again reminded her it was supposed to be for my birthday and it hurts that she'd rather go out drinking with friends. 

She said that's not true but I pointed out she's refusing to actually consider moving the plans with her friends so it is true. 

She said I was being too unreasonable and should be open to moving the plans instead of expecting her to cancel with her friends. AITA for expecting my partner to cancel plans?",0.0,0.9237341284751892,1,0
98,1dqf5vj,AITA for insisting to my husband and his parents that I need help with our kids and we need to hire someone and it's not me trying to pawn my stepdaughter off on someone else?,"My husband and I have three kids in our home. My stepdaughter is 9, I have known her since she was 2 and I became her stepmom when she was 4. We also have a 3 year old son and a 10 month old daughter together. To give some background info first:

My stepdaughter's mom was not in the picture when I met my husband. She never wanted to claim any parental responsibilities and when I met my husband, his ex had accumulated a lot of child support debt and had not seen my stepdaughter since the hospital. I signed up for being a second parent and I love my stepdaughter and in my heart I consider her one of my kids just as much as my bio children. We had such a good relationship. She would sometimes call me mom, sometimes my name, but she'd always say my husband and I were her parents and she adored her brother when he was born.

Over two years ago her mom came back into the picture and said she wanted to see my stepdaughter. My husband said it would need to be a gradual thing but my stepdaughter had a right to know her. His ex didn't like that and sued for full custody, and yes, after having nothing to do with her for 7 years. She lost but this started us on a step up plan for her to gain some custody. It's been hell.

My relationship with my stepdaughter suffered badly because of all this. Her relationship with her siblings has also suffered. She is rude to me now, refuses to listen to me and rejects the three of us. It's always worse after she sees her mom. My husband took this issue to court and the judge made it clear he will never sever the relationship between mom and daughter, no matter what.

I'm struggling. If I give her the time and attention needed, it comes at the cost to our younger kids. But if I focus just on them, it's not giving her the time and attention she needs and the counselor told us she needs to see I'm not going anywhere. She really emphasized that it was important.

The counselor even spoke to the judge (a different one this time) and the judge said he was going to follow the previous judges decision that contact is never to be severed between mother and daughter. My husband brought this issue back to court because it was getting worse.

So now we're at a point where I can't be in charge of all three at the same time all day, especially now school is out but even during school time it's too much. I told my husband we need to hire some sort of helper for me with the kids. He was against it and told me it was a big expense after we spent a fortune on court and therapy. His parents heard us talking about it the other day and they jumped in to say I wouldn't do this if all three were my bio kids and I just want to pawn my stepdaughter off on someone else. I insisted this was not true to all three and I insisted I needed help because the kids will suffer in the long run and so will my mental health.

My husband felt guilty because I got very emotional but his parents said I just proved I wouldn't do this if they were all really mine.

100,1dqf1h4,AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don’t want a cat right now?,"So about a month ago, my boyfriend and I (24F) found a kitten in our backyard. We tried to leave it for the mother to come take back but she never did. We ended up caring for it to make sure it stayed alive. 

My boyfriend has always wanted a black cat and mentioned getting one someday with me. He thought it was fate that it showed up and wants to keep it. I love pets, just not having them in my house if that makes sense. When he said someday (about a year ago) I didn’t think it would happen so soon. I just don’t love the hair getting on my clothes and all in the carpet. I don’t like dealing with kitty doors, litter smells, cat food, cat toys everywhere, etc. He said he would deal with it all but I still have to live around it. He has to wear it out and play with it a lot because it’s a kitten and it barely ever wants to be cuddly, it just wants to bite and play. He said once it became more of an “outside cat” at 6 months it would be easier but how can I be sure? 

I’ve tried to hide it but he knows I don’t totally like it and is starting to think about getting rid of it (possibly to a family member). I feel bad because now he has become somewhat attached. He has mentioned how he’s always wanted a black cat. He has a cute little name for her and has bought her stuff. He has had a couple cute moments with her. I would hate to make him get rid of it now but I don’t want a 12+ year commitment. I want to be able to travel and take trips without lining up someone to watch it and feed it. I don’t want him to despise me for the decision and I’m not sure that there is anyway to meet in the middle on this debate. 

I do really feel like the asshole, so Any advice would be great. Thank you! :)

101,1dqepfb,AITA for offering support to my SonIL while my daughter also needed it?,"My daughter Ciara (26f) and her husband Jett (28m) lost their stillborn baby son last month. While everyone, Ciara's side and Jett's side, have focused on Ciara, Jett has been ignored and overlooked. Ciara mentioned it to me the other day and I promised her I would spend some time with him and do my best to offer support. She told me she was so worried about him and he wouldn't burden her because he was afraid it would be too much, but she knew he was struggling and had nobody comforting him beside her but I even saw it with my own eyes, he was pushing himself aside and just focusing on Ciara's grief, and the fact Ciara lost their little boy.

Two days ago my husband, my other daughter Sarah (24f) and I went to see Ciara and Jett. While my husband and Sarah were with Ciara, I went to check on Jett and told him he could lean on me/open up to me if he needed to talk. He was hesitant to do it around Ciara in case he upset her more so we went to get some lunch and while we were gone he broke down and admitted he was broken. He confessed to trying to keep it together for Ciara. That his parents, friends of his and Ciara's and some neighbors had all told him he needed to be her rock through all of this. It broke my heart. I also felt guilty because originally I focused more on Ciara because she's my baby. But Jett's parents also focused on Ciara and not on him. I apologized for not doing this sooner and I let him talk and cry. I also told him not to be afraid to open up to Ciara. That it was much healthier for them to grieve together and be open with each other. By the time we left he agreed that he should be more open with Ciara. 

When we got back to the house Jett's parents and brothers were there as well and Ciara was sobbing her poor heart out. Something she had ordered for my grandson had arrived while Jett and I were out and it brought it all back. Jett's family were furious that he left Ciara and were scolding him for abandoning her. I told them he needed some time himself. They dismissed that and told me he needs to be a man and to be there for his wife. My husband and Sarah were mad at me for supporting Jett while Ciara needed me. They said I could have waited for another day, when Ciara wasn't struggling as much and things weren't as fresh. Ciara was so upset by everyone's reaction and she feels bad which I hate and I assured her this was not her fault. But the whole thing is a mess and it made me realize just how easily everyone dismisses Jett in all of this.

104,1dqe2xx,AITA for deciding not to go to my aunt’s funeral after my mother got me involved too much?,"
Background: we live in an Eastern European country. My mother’s family comes from a remote village in the mountains, so the people there are pretty religious, with many traditions. She is the youngest of eight, so she is used to being the one to help. 
Onto the story. Three days ago, my mother called me to tell me that my aunt (uncle’s wife) had died after being on life support for a few weeks. I told her that I’ll go to the funeral to show my sympathies, although I hate all kinds of gatherings, because I know she is a family person and I love my mother.
Yesterday evening I got a call from my father that, because the funeral takes place in another village where they didn’t pay their share to the church, the church couldn’t help with the funeral organization, just with the sermon. That means we had to help and I was to carry something from the chapel to the grave and he didn’t want me to drive two hours to be blindsided like I was at a past funeral. 
When another aunt had died in the same area, I got there and was surprised I had to carry a flag. Now I’m not comfortable in religious environments because I’m an atheist and awkward around people. That 200 meter walk was hell for me, which I made sure I told my parents. I asked them never to put me in that situation again. I assume that’s why my father called me this time, because they knew they screwed up. 
I asked them why they didn’t support me. Why they didn’t tell my uncle that I was not comfortable or an atheist or whatever excuse they wanted to use. I would’ve taken the blame, just don’t put me in that situation. I also told them they always do this and then get mad when I tell them how I feel about it, especially my mother. He said they had nobody to help. Remember how I told you my mother was youngest of eight? Yeah, they had plenty of people to help, they just had to offer me. After writing to my father how I felt they always put others before me and how it made me feel, he said I should probably not go at all, at which point I stopped responding, because I was right, my mother got mad and I would get worse now and things that shouldn’t be said would’ve been said.

105,1dqdnr2,AITA for being honest with my therapist after they said something unforgivable?,"I (NB 27) had a therapist for 8 years, on and off, but mostly on. They helped me a lot through my ups and downs, they suggested to me to go and talk with a psychiatrist because I was severely depressed, and they know everything or almost everything about me. My strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, etc.  
I was going to group therapy, since it was the only therapy I could afford since I was let go of my job July 2023. 
But In December, my money for therapy ran out, and I was no longer capable of paying. I told them and the group that I would not be attending more sessions after January, and they all seemed to agree even though it was sad. I thought everything was alright. We made a good group, that supported each other. 
That last day, I said my goodbyes, but my therapist didn't seem happy. They said I was leaving without saying goodbye properly, and that my leave, would make the group crumble. I told them that they already knew. They were not happy, but the group, even though they were sad, understood. 
My therapist approached me a couple of weeks later. Asked me to do a proper goodbye. I sent a heartfelt message, thanking them and the group for all the support, in hopes to meet them again one day, but my therapist decided to tell me in front of the group that I was being selfish and hurting them , almost on purpose.

Fast forward April, they invited me to a group meeting but I was not ready, so I said I would get back to them. 
Yesterday I received a message from them , saying that I should be really mad if I wasn't able to even tell them what was going on and try to fix it. But after being called selfish for not being able to afford it and standing my ground, I had enough. 
I told them that I was rn in a point of my life that, anything that would make me crumble, I was going to avoid . I told them that I was not comfortable but thanked them for all the tools they gave me to survive . 
I feel weird, because maybe they were trying to make amends, but I was simply not ready?
AITA for being honest with them?

I (NB 27) had a therapist for 8 years, on and off, but mostly on. They helped me a lot through my ups and downs, they suggested to me to go and talk with a psychiatrist because I was severely depressed, and they know everything or almost everything about me. My strengths, weaknesses, insecurities, etc.  
I was going to group therapy, since it was the only therapy I could afford since I was let go of my job July 2023. 
But In December, my money for therapy ran out, and I was no longer capable of paying. I told them and the group that I would not be attending more sessions after January, and they all seemed to agree even though it was sad. I thought everything was alright. We made a good group, that supported each other. 
That last day, I said my goodbyes, but my therapist didn't seem happy. They said I was leaving without saying goodbye properly, and that my leave, would make the group crumble. I told them that they already knew. They were not happy, but the group, even though they were sad, understood. 
My therapist approached me a couple of weeks later. Asked me to do a proper goodbye. I sent a heartfelt message, thanking them and the group for all the support, in hopes to meet them again one day, but my therapist decided to tell me in front of the group that I was being selfish and hurting them , almost on purpose. I replied back that it was not my intention in the slightest, but they simply kicked me out of the group.

108,1dqd03f,AITA for having guest over and wanting to change apartment guest policy,"I (21F) recently moved into an apartment with two other people for the summer, Maya 21F and Vicky 21F. A few days ago, a friend came over to have a few drinks and watch a movie. It was a bit last minute but I asked for everyone's permission and it was okay as long as we didn't get a noise complaint. At around 11:30pm, Maya texted me to be quieter and I apologized and said we were on our way out anyway. Noise-wise, I made sure my laptop volume was less than halfway (we don't have a tv) and we chatted throughout the movie which may have been what Maya thought was loud. Also, this was the first time I had a guest over.

The next morning, Maya sent the apartment groupchat this roommate agreement she had typed up. It outlined house rules and detailed guest policies, communal areas, and room privileges. This kinda peeved me cause I was expecting a simple follow-up like hey could you make sure to be quieter next time but this roommate agreement seemed a bit passive-aggressive. Regardless, I went with it and added a few things like getting a cleaning schedule and making a list of communal items. The only thing I wanted to change was the guest policy of asking for permission 3-6 hours in advance. I suggested we simplify it to just getting permission from the housemates. But she pushed back saying that guests can't come over within 1 hour of a housemate using the kitchen or eating in the living room. I thought this was overkill and it would be just as effective if I asked and they were like oh could you wait an hour for me to eat.

I didn't say anything and suggested we meet to discuss this further. Around this time, I found out from Vicky that Maya was hella pissed off about the night before. She complained that she didn't want guests and didn't like me drinking with a friend. This annoyed me cause I understand if she thought we were loud. But, saying she doesn't want guests over when her bf is staying a few nights next week seems unfair. Anyway, we had our roommate conversation and I thought we were on the same page. Guests need to be approved by housemates ahead of time and all other stuff was fine. But then Vicky and Maya went into Maya's room and it was pretty obvious that they were talking about me and this whole thing cause at one point Maya was getting heated and I could hear them from the living room.

I left the apartment cause I was annoyed and after I came back, they both wanted to go over the guest policy again. They said you have to tell us when they're leaving/coming and if you're going to cook food/eat a meal together. I said that I would just text the gc and ask for permission and left again cause this was getting repetitive. Later I heard Maya on the phone complaining about it and calling me unreasonable.

I am not into hookups, but I have many friends having a hot girl summer I’m in support of, but this was an exception to the rule. This friend recently left a relationship she deemed right person wrong timing, but it was toxic from the start. Yet, I kept my opinions to myself. She ended the relationship because she wanted to rekindle a hookup that she was entertaining before the relationship started. I was by her side through the breakup and provided a shoulder to cry on 24/7, even picking her up from ex’s apt. at 3am after she visited post breakup and started a bad fight. She continued to h.u with the ex while hooking up with other men. It wasn’t until she started to spiral and not focus on her mental and physical health that I recommended she focus on herself and receive free therapy services from our college campus. She didn’t listen. She became a self sabotaging, male centered friend who would reach out if she needed to cry, but would never check on me, my relationship, well being, new job, etc. I brushed it off,  telling myself she’s 3 years younger and is going through a hard time, it will pass. One day, a long time friend of mine (24M) reached out and said that he was interested in her. With her permission, I gave him her contact info. He is a really sweet guy and I thought it could be good for her to see how she should want to be treated and not used.

The owner (Tom) who has another brand besides the one I worked at initially, was short a GM at the second highest grossing store in the company and needed a GM to run it. I had a great assistant GM (Dan 22m) who basically saved my ass and the store from closing down when no one else would step up; he was around my age when I first started managing and I asked him if he would be willing to step into the role. He hesitantly agreed if I would still be there for him as a mentor, I agreed since I love him like a brother. 
I knew from day 1 at the new store that I needed to change the model from QSR to full service by March; this wasn’t possible with current staff and I told Tom that I could do June at the earliest; he agreed. I’ll say here that Tom has a habit of being very ADHD and has a weird fixation on this one particular store because he lives down the street. 
For the next 6 months, I staffed the store to the best of my ability, explaining to each new hire the end goal and  how there would be a certain level of chaos involved so they had an out if they weren’t on board. The only employee I didn’t hire was a bartender (Mallory 23f), a relative of an employee at another of Tom’s restaurants. He pitched her a hybrid QSR/full service model where she would be the only person taking tables and the rest of the staff would be “support”
Once we were finally staffed to sufficient levels (exactly on schedule) I started testing full service using our current employees, which coincided with a stint of Mallory being sick for a few days. When she came back, she was confused about what was going on and felt she had been cheated out of her position. When I realized she had been promised a different set of expectations, I told her she needed to speak with Tom about this. 
After our busiest day, my top manager at this store Ellie and I were told “fuck the labor” in regards to the level of service that would be required. This is notable as she and I had been putting in insane hours. As a result, I hired more people to do jobs that I would otherwise have done myself, despite wanting to cut down on labor expenses. In addition, Ellie was promised a role as GM by Tom so that I could fulfill the vacant role of Director of Operations once we were at sufficient staff levels and has not followed through. 
Recently Mallory spoke to Tom. According to her, Tom told her that full service was my idea. Same week, he told Ellie and I to cut the labor due to sales. Since I found out about, I almost walked out the door and never came back in anger. 
As I’m close with all my managers, we had a group hang to bitch about everything at my behest. As a result, they’ve all decided to start looking for other jobs as they’re so furious about how Ellie and I have been treated.

My brother being rough on things my parents basically bought him used bicycles or store brand they were lucky if they lasted the summer or in some cases a day or two, cheap bikes weren't worth fixing so they got thrown out most of the time and my sister did the math in one year they spent 470$ on used bikes. During that time I was spending 12000$ on show bicycles and customs. 

I always offered to buy him a nice bike but my parents always shot the idea down saying it would look bad if I bought one brother a 500$ bmx while everyone else rode cheap bikes, I stopped pushing the issue after that. Now that we're adults and my mom is on her own she was able to at least buy him one nice bike that got some years out of it which shocked me because it was a Walmart huffy. The bike is pushing 5 years now and the frame cracked from riding like it was a bmx. 

My mom wanted to get him another store brand with my brothers and sister all pitching in to get him a 200$ bike that didn't look durable or his size, I told her I already bought him a 600$ adult bmx because it's just easier to fix and repair and it was already on its way to her. She thanked me for the gesture and ended the conversation. 

20 minutes later I get shit from all the siblings about why I did something without bringing them into the mix since they all wanted to buy him a bike as a group for his birthday(August). He needs the bike now not on his birthday and told them I'd be glad to take 80$ cash from each of them to cover the price, they all balled at the idea and said I shouldve picked a cheaper bike.I told them he still needs a helmet and lights but that seemed to fire them up more I basically told them the bike has been bought they can figure out what else to get him on his birthday and hung up.

He needs the bike now not on his birthday and told them I'd be glad to take 80$ cash from each of them to cover the price, they all balled at the idea and said I shouldve picked a cheaper bike.I told them he still needs a helmet and lights but that seemed to fire them up more I basically told them the bike has been bought they can figure out what else to get him on his birthday and hung up. AITA for wanting to make sure my brother has a good bike for once?

113,1dqbpg7,WIBTA if I quit just because the manager upset me?,"I (16 F) am unsure if quitting my job is the right option, but I'm leaning more towards quitting.

I work at a bakery as front staff. This is my first job, it has been fine so far, but because people keep quitting, we're short staffed. I also have Level 1 Autism (which I think is a disability?) as well as Major Depressive Disorder and a few more minor issues.

It's hard for me to understand social cues and I get upset really easily. It's been busy at my work recently, and so everyone is stressed out. I get that, but how my manager acted isn't okay.

The day this incident happened was a prep day, so we were closed. My manager called me over to help her. She told me to bag some bread, and I asked her why as I had just seen my coworker bag that type of bread, and we only needed to bag 19. She said she miscounted, but I couldn't understand what she had miscounted. The order said nineteen, and that's how many we needed. It was marked on a list in front of her, and she wasn't even the one who bagged the bread. If anybody miscounted, it would've been our co-worker.

I know that I shouldn't have asked her how she'd miscounted. I'm really bad at understanding when to shut up, and what not to say. Regardless, yelling at me is unprofessional and it upset me. I could barely hold back tears, so I  bagged the bread and then went to the bathroom to cry.

When I finally managed to stop crying I came back out front. My manager noticed that I was gone and wondered where I went. I said I was in the bathroom. She didn't notice how red my eyes were (thank god!), and I spent the rest of the day trying not to cry.

At least two times after that my co-workers made comments about me being to slow, so by the end of the day I wanted to leave as soon as possible. Unfortunately, my manager called me over to talk to her.

She said that as my manager it was her job to tell me that I work too slow. I know that I'm not the fastest, but I am gradually improving. Something that used to take me 60 minutes not takes 20.

She said I need to be faster, but I'm already trying my best. On top of work, I have summer school for 4 hours every day before I go to work for 6 more hours. This is really upsetting and I'm trying my best not to slip into a depressive episode, but its hard not to.There is personal stuff going on in my life as well that is making me sad. I had a mental breakdown after leaving my work and cried for almost an hour. I don't know if I should quit because I like some of my co-workers, but I feel like I'm not good enough/fast enough in my co-worker's and manager's eyes. I don't want to upset them by quitting but I don't think I can do this for much longer. I feel like my manager should have at least apologized for yelling at me and gave me tips on how to speed up my work before even having that conversation with me.

117,1dqb9vb,AITA for kicking my husband to another room cause he keeping waking me up at night,"I (40 F) and my husband (38 M) have had problems sleeping ever since our first child. Any noise he makes wakes me up. It could be shifting, snoring, rolling over, or even louder than normal breathing.

I have put several counter measures in place. I wear earplugs, and turn white noise on as loud as possible. We have a nice temperpedic and temperature controlled bed that is supposed to help me sleep. And it does work when my husband is not here. I also have medication to help me sleep to include melatonin, anti-anxiety meds, and anti-depressants.

We even both had a sleep study done. He had surgery to stop him from snoring, and nose strips to help. 

My husband is a contractor and away from home quite often. When he is gone I sleep peacefully and happily; however, as soon as we try and sleep together I’m awake every hour of the night. 

I wake him up each time he does it so that he can turn over and stop whatever noise he is making that is keeping awake but this can occur up to like 17 times a night. Which neither me nor my husband can handle.

We have started sleeping in separate rooms, he will go sleep upstairs in the guest room, or I will sleep on the sofa (I cannot sleep on the upstairs guest room because the bed is hard and I have back pains for years and recently got surgery for it). We try and sleep together but it never works out well. 

Three nights ago he got back from a long trip and since then I have not had a good night of sleep and neither has he. We just had a huge fight which resulted in him kicking me out to sleep in the guest bed after getting drunk.

120,1dqabua,AITA for telling my friend she should probably seek a therapist? ,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.
I(30F) have a friend (32F) that I have known for about 3 years. She and I met through mutual friends, and we bonded over our similar upbringing in a smalltown and then moving to a big city.
 
Recently I have been feeling like we are growing apart to a point, and that she is too emotionally reliant on me to a point where I feel stressed talking to her, but because she doesn’t have many close friends out here I feel guilty at the thought of distancing myself from her.
 
Some examples of this include：
1. After breaking up with her boyfriend of 3years (it was a mutual decision) she wasn’t invited to a birthday party of one of the ex’s friends that she and I have become friends with, called me sobbing and asking me if I can talk to the host and ask if she could come because she feels disrespected and excluded.

2. She gets irritated and emotional right before her period to an extreme where she would lash out at anyone for the smallest things like listening to music too loud or cry over a perceived slight (we once wanted two different things for lunch and she cried saying I must want her to get fat because I knew she was on a diet and I still wanted taco bell.)

3. When we went on a overseas vacation with our friends, we had one stay in a luxury all inclusive resort, and when I opted to stay behind to enjoy the resort instead of exploring the tourists sites, she cried saying I must not want to spend time with her and we all consoled her for an hour. I did go to the tourist site in the end.
 
After the most recent emotional meltdown, I gently told her maybe she needs to talk to a therapist, because some of her emotional issues seem a little extreme, and perhaps a therapist can help her with tools she might lack in order to understand why she is feeling this way and what she can do to help herself.
 
She told me that I am an asshole and that I am making her out to be some mentally unstable psycho if I’m seriously suggesting she needs a therapist for feeling sad over some small things.
 
She has since been silent but I heard through some mutual friends that she is talking about how I was being a bad friend, and some of them have reached out to me to say that I should apologize, which makes me second guess if what I said was wrong.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-28,"AITA for telling my friend she should probably seek a therapist?  Throwaway for obvious reasons.
I(30F) have a friend (32F) that I have known for about 3 years. She and I met through mutual friends, and we bonded over our similar upbringing in a smalltown and then moving to a big city.
 
Recently I have been feeling like we are growing apart to a point, and that she is too emotionally reliant on me to a point where I feel stressed talking to her, but because she doesn’t have many close friends out here I feel guilty at the thought of distancing myself from her.
 
Some examples of this include：
1. After breaking up with her boyfriend of 3years (it was a mutual decision) she wasn’t invited to a birthday party of one of the ex’s friends that she and I have become friends with, called me sobbing and asking me if I can talk to the host and ask if she could come because she feels disrespected and excluded.

122,1dqa57y,AITA - called my SIL selfish,"AITA for distancing from SIL?

I (28F) had enough of my future SIL’s (26F) attitude and got very upset a week ago. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I didn’t say anything to her about it, but told my fiance that I needed space from her for awhile. That I wasn’t going to go to a birthday party and pretend to enjoy her presence, so I’m not going. He’s upset that I’m “acting like this and creating a rift over personal issues.” AITA for refusing to attend a family function & for calling her selfish? 

Back story, there’s been several things that have rubbed me the wrong way before the recent one. 

Christmas: She bought and wrapped a gift to my fiance “from me” without my knowledge. Did it as a joke. The gift were slippers that said “Best Dad”. Everyone there thought I was trying to announce a pregnancy; I had no idea of the joke before she showed up with a gift “you got this for name”. It made me feel so uncomfortable, especially considering I have a sensitive fertility history & likely won’t get pregnant naturally. Has never apologized. 

She ignored my birthday; it’s been a month and has still not mentioned it. Not even a text. Whatever, but… I did a lot for hers. Two months before, I drove 45 minutes each way to her birthday dinner at a restaurant I hate, and gave her a gift worth $75. No thank you from her regarding the gifts. 

She showed up to my wedding dress appointment smelling like w33d. 

She will not share the name of the hairdresser she goes to, not even a first name, with me. She goes to fantastic sam’s, so it’s not like it’s some secretive exclusive salon. 

She taunted the idea of adopting her clients’ dog to my brother for a month and a half. She mentioned it again, he was so excited, and at the end of that day, she said “I think I’m going to take him and try it for a week”. She has a dog already. She’s left it at her mom’s since she can’t have it in an apartment. It took a week for her to say “I’m sorry that you’re upset with me over this, I never should have drug you two into it” 
Full disclosure - she’s finally sober for the first time, so the Christmas thing would’ve been in active addiction

125,1dq9mnv,AITA for staying at a hotel instead of my mom’s house at 38 years old with a wife and 2 kids?,"I’m 38, married with two kids, and have been living out-of-state for the past 16 years. My childhood was complicated by my parents’ divorce, which often left me feeling divided between two homes.

We’re planning a trip back to my hometown for a week to visit family and friends, including my mom, stepdad, dad, stepmom, sister, stepsister, cousins, and sister-in-law. My mom and stepdad plan to take my eldest child to a family camp with their other grandchildren, which I think is a wonderful opportunity for them to bond.

In preparation for our visit, I booked flights and a hotel that’s centrally located and within 30 minutes of everyone we want to see. The hotel has a pool and other amenities that will make our stay more like a vacation. When I shared our plans with my mom, including the hotel booking, she seemed disappointed and offered her house instead, saying it’s nicer than a hotel.

I explained that while we appreciate her offer, we need our own space and want to ensure our trip feels like a vacation. I also mentioned that we’ve had similar offers from other family members, but we believe a hotel provides a neutral location that’s fair to everyone.

My mom expressed that she was hurt by our decision. She couldn’t understand why we wouldn’t want to stay in her home, especially since she was offering us the entire downstairs basement, which she insists is nicer than any hotel room.

I reiterated that our choice to stay in a hotel is not a slight against her. It’s about managing the stress that comes with visiting so many family members and ensuring that we have a fair and balanced experience. Staying at a hotel gives us the chance to recharge and be fully present when we’re spending time with family.

She continued to push back, arguing that staying at her house would save us money and provide an opportunity for deeper family bonding. She listed the amenities of her home, like the lake, club pool, and ample space for hosting gatherings, as reasons why we should reconsider.

Later, my sister reached out via text, saying that our decision felt like a slap in the face. She emphasized that the kids were looking forward to spending time together and that family should make sacrifices for each other.

I responded by saying that our decision to stay at a hotel won’t affect the quality time we spend with family. It’s about creating a balanced experience for everyone involved and taking care of our mental health. We need a place where we can decompress after a day of visiting.

My sister replied, saying that I am being selfish for the one week a year we’re in town. She said it’s important to be with family and that we should stay with them while still having the freedom to see everyone we want.

127,1dq977o,AITA for spending time with my friend during a team trip?,"Last semester, I went on a trip to Chicago with some of my college teammates (eight people in total) to see a football game and explore the city. Most of us didn’t have a lot of money, so we only stayed for one full day and two nights in a single air bnb.

I was particularly excited to go because my childhood/high school best friend went to school in Chicago, and I hadn’t seen her in a few years. I talked with my teammates and asked if she could join us during dinner, and everyone said it was fine except for our team captain (for context, I was on good terms with everyone except for the team captain. We weren’t necessarily on bad terms, but we have very different personalities). Our team captain said she’d prefer it to be team only so we could work on team bonding and building relationships with each other. After a few exchanges, I was able to convince her to let my friend join dinner an hour after our reservation so we had time just as a team while still allowing me to see my friend.

When my friend got to dinner, her and my teammates all chatted and got along. At the end of dinner, she invited us all to her own teammate’s house party later that night (which was just their own university team so around 30 people). I thought it sounded fun, and didn’t think it would be an issue because our itinerary only planned stuff from 7am-10pm and then we were just going to stay in and watch a movie. Half of my team wanted to go and the other half didn’t, so we agreed we would just split off for the night.

At this point our team captain chimed in and said we couldn’t go because she didn’t want to and we were using her mom’s car, which only she was allowed to drive. I told her it was no problem and that we would just Uber, but she said as team captain, she wouldn’t allow that because Ubers “are not safe”. I got defensive and said we would be fine together as a group of four, and that we were adults and didn’t need her permission to go out. She was mad but ended up going with us because she was adamant on us not taking an uber. We all had fun but she stayed in the corner on her phone the whole time.

Throughout the next week, she noticeably ignored me and gave me the cold shoulder. I eventually sent her a text asking if everything was ok, and she responded with a very long text saying how I ruined the team trip, was selfish for spending time with my friend, and put her in a difficult position as team captain. Normally I would just apologize to keep the peace, but this time I rebutted and said she was being controlling, using her position for power, and that she didn't even have to go to the house party.

Nothing got resolved and we still haven’t spoken in a few months. I want to make amends so it doesn’t affect our team going forward, but also just don’t think I have anything to apologize for?

We weren’t necessarily on bad terms, but we have very different personalities). Our team captain said she’d prefer it to be team only so we could work on team bonding and building relationships with each other. After a few exchanges, I was able to convince her to let my friend join dinner an hour after our reservation so we had time just as a team while still allowing me to see my friend.

When my friend got to dinner, her and my teammates all chatted and got along. At the end of dinner, she invited us all to her own teammate’s house party later that night (which was just their own university team so around 30 people). I thought it sounded fun, and didn’t think it would be an issue because our itinerary only planned stuff from 7am-10pm and then we were just going to stay in and watch a movie. Half of my team wanted to go and the other half didn’t, so we agreed we would just split off for the night.

At this point our team captain chimed in and said we couldn’t go because she didn’t want to and we were using her mom’s car, which only she was allowed to drive. I told her it was no problem and that we would just Uber, but she said as team captain, she wouldn’t allow that because Ubers “are not safe”. I got defensive and said we would be fine together as a group of four, and that we were adults and didn’t need her permission to go out. She was mad but ended up going with us because she was adamant on us not taking an uber. We all had fun but she stayed in the corner on her phone the whole time.

Throughout the next week, she noticeably ignored me and gave me the cold shoulder. I eventually sent her a text asking if everything was ok, and she responded with a very long text saying how I ruined the team trip, was selfish for spending time with my friend, and put her in a difficult position as team captain. Normally I would just apologize to keep the peace, but this time I rebutted and said she was being controlling, using her position for power, and that she didn't even have to go to the house party.

Nothing got resolved and we still haven’t spoken in a few months. I want to make amends so it doesn’t affect our team going forward, but also just don’t think I have anything to apologize for? AITA?",0.0,1.0196540355682373,1,0

129,1dq8ylw,AITA For Refusing to Sing Happy Birthday to a Deceased Relative?,"Today would have been the birthday of my paternal grandmother had she not passed four years ago. I (33F) just received a call from my mother on speaker phone next to my father alerting me to be ready because in 30 minutes there will be a video chat to sing happy birthday to my deceased grandmother. My heart immediately sank. The loss of my grandmother was the hardest thing I ever had to deal with. I grieved intensely. The idea of singing happy birthday to my deceased grandmother immediately unsettled me. I am not comfortable at all with doing something like that.

I had a difficult time hiding my shock of being told that I was expected to participate in such a thing and was silent. My parents then told me that they bought a cake and it would be fun and they did;t understand why I was not excited. I said that the idea of having a cake and saying happy birthday to someone who is no longer with us is ""interesting"" and ""not something I've ever heard of."" I then said I had to go make other preparations for bed so I could be ready for when they call.

After a few minutes I texted my mother to let her know that she completely put me on the spot by calling me with something like that in front of my father and that this is not the kind of thing I want to do. I told her how unsettled I feel about it and how much my chest hurts even thinking about doing something like this. I also used the word ""weird"" to describe the act.

My mother immediately called me difficult and said I always make everything into a big deal. She said she doesn't even know what I mean when I say that I feel unsettled by it. I told her that I am happy to celebrate my grandmother's life but not with a cake that she cannot blow out or with the song happy birthday. She immediately dismissed me and said ""bye \[my name\]. I told her that dismissing me is not cool and I am entitled to my feelings. I also said that they are free to do whatever they like but the idea of me participating makes my chest hurt. She then told me to ""just leave it alone"" and did not respond to my request to be part of the call before or after the singing so I could still be with everyone while thinking about my grandmother.

I feel extremely hurt and dismissed that my desire to not sing happy birthday to my deceased grandmother was not understood by my mother. I am afraid that my father feels that I was not supportive of him. Aita for not just sucking it up for the few minutes of singing no matter how terrible the idea of singing that song makes me feel?

We are childhood friends, and met in 4th grade where i fell head over heels in love. Jake (fake name) and i have been dating for a year and three months this monday, and its been such an amazing relationship, I absolutely adore him. But, theres one thing that I am kinda annoyed about. Were long distance, not super long, we still see each other kind of often but it's an annoying distance thats close but still far, and our main form of talking is through texting. I don't mind him having to go, everyone does, were both athletic and academically motivated teenagers so I get having a lot to do, but a lot of times he wont tell me hes leaving, rather, he just leaves. I've brought this up to him, and told him I would appreciate it if you could say ""hey gtg ily bye"" at LEAST, and I even said i know that sometimes its so fast you don't have time to say that! he took it well, and he did well with telling me. I tell him every time I have to go, and of course I have those moments where I wont reply right away because I was mid doing something. I get that, and it is totally normal, I just can't get behind doing it mid conversation. Today, he and his family, his friends family, and their friend went up to another state 4.5 hours away. He drove, so ofc I didn't expect him to text and drive, but when he got there, and they set everything up he was texting me non stop, jokes all around, and then he just left. This was six hours ago, and I really dont know. My texts are delivering, which means it's not dead. I don't know, I feel like im being controlling, but this has gone on for a year, and I've brought it up a few times, and when he does it through a whole day where he all of a sudden out of the blue has something, and doesnt let me know, it kind of gets annoying. If I do get annoyed or upset, he won't ever link the two together, and keep asking me whats wrong. When I tell him, he just says sorry and moves on. He didn't know about this trip until last night when he was on the phone with me, hung up and didn't text me until this morning explaining what was going on. I don't know, i feel bad for being annoyed but I think I've got attatchment issues.  I love him more than words describe, and I know he loves me too and isn't cheating, hes incredibly religious so thats not in the question. Am I in the wrong for feeling this way?

131,1dq8beg,AITA for being mad at someone for making me figure out my own way home after they met a new group of people,"I went on a trip five hours away with some friends recently. One of my friends drove. We had plans to go there that Thursday and leave Monday. I also had to be at work Tuesday in the morning and they knew this.
 They’re both single and I’m not but I was cool letting them do their thing. I even had a day to myself so they could go out and meet guys. On that day they both met guys who they think could be the relationship material. We all hung out as they had a big group or friends and I really liked everyone too. On the last night I decided to go to bed early and they stayed with the guys and their group. We were supposed to check out of our Hotel that following day and they were nowhere to be found or heard from that morning. I figured that they were still with the guys/the group so I just started packing our stuff. An hour before check out they came in and told me that they were actually going to stay a few more days with the guys and their group and that I was invited. I was very upset, I didn’t yell at them or anything but I walked away on the phone with my husband letting him know that I was extremely upset, so I’m sure they overheard. I kept walking until I was out of hearing range and came up with a plan to get home. I ultimately had to rent a moving truck to get home. But I’m annoyed because they really don’t think they did anything wrong. All they can think about is the fact that they found new forever friends and don’t understand why I was so upset about the situation. Now they’re love bombing me to get on my good side and I honestly don’t want anything to do with them anymore. I really don’t want to be associated with people who would do that to me.

132,1dq893s,AITA for finding it weird to ask overnight guests not to use the upstairs bathroom even if their bedroom is upstairs?,"For a bit of context: my fiance and I have very different needs for privacy. I'm a very open person, happy to share anything and rarely need my own space. He, on the other hand, is very private and doesn't like people using his things or going into his space. 

We have guests over frequently and friends and family stay over at our place very often, with average stays around 2 weeks. 
Currently, we live in an apartment with one bathroom so we have always been sharing the bathroom with guests. 

We are now moving to a house with 2 bathrooms, both full bathrooms with shower. One bathroom is on the ground floor (with the living room/kitchen/dining) and the other bathroom is on the first floor (with the 2 bedrooms). Guests would be staying in the smaller upstairs bedroom. The bathroom upstairs is not an en-suite bathroom, it is in-between the 2 bedrooms. 

My boyfriend has always wanted us to have a private bathroom, he thinks it's unhygienic to share a bathroom with other people. Our preference would have been an en-suite bathroom but it was hard to find one. 

Now he is saying we should just tell our guests that it is a rule in our house that they use only the downstairs bathroom. So, they would have to always go down a flight of stairs to use the bathroom, even at night. I find this rude and unwelcoming. Especially that we often have our parents over and they are getting older and often wake up to pee at night. I find it rude and unsafe to expect to go down stairs to go pee. I think people should just use the closest bathroom to wherever they are in the house. 

Now, even though I find the setup he is proposing uncomfortable, I told him if it is really important to him, he should be the one to tell the guests. I find it awkward and don't want to be the person to do it. He says this is mean and we should be a team and make this decision as a united front. For eg, he would prefer I ask my mom to do this or guests that I'm closer to. I don't want to do that. I would actually just prefer we don't have this setup at all.

I've been wanting to bleach my eyebrows for a while. I told my boyfriend this, and he told me he didn't want me to because he doesn't like the look. The thing is, he prefers me with short hair, I have long hair right now; I prefer him with long hair and he has short hair right now — it's not the end of the world. So I figured this could be the same way, since it's not like it's permanent. I told him I'd probably get it done anyway and if it looks bad, he can make fun of me all he wants. He said that if I do that, he'll bleach his brows, I didn't really care.

Anyway, I bleached them, and I really like how they look. He DOESN'T like how it looks, which I knew was an option, but it was making him really upset. Like he said, ""I can't believe you did it"" and then he literally got in his car and left. Then when I texted him, I just got an hours late response of ""I can't talk to you right now."" The next time we meet up, we ended up just yelling at each other. When things are starting to cool down, he tells me that maybe he should bleach his hair so we're ""even."" I didn't think there was anything to get ""even"" about, but I thought he might look good with bleached hair and I also thought he was just suggesting it on some level because he already wanted to.

He did it, I like it on him, he hates it. He says I put him in this situation with the eyebrows thing and then hyping him to do it after when I should have known he was doing it for a petty reason. I feel like if I'm the asshole here it's because I didn't take him seriously? Like I didn't think he was totally doing it to get even. I don't know anyone else who'd dye their hair just to borderline spite someone else like ??? 😭 I feel bad but I also feel like it's not really my fault here.

134,1dq7u73,AITA for leaving belongings behind after moving out of an old apartment?,"My roommates (22F & 21F) who I met more or less, on roommate tinder, and I (24F) have decided to discontinue our lease at the end of it at the end of this month. One of my roommates, Johnny (22F), suggested we hire a cleaning service so we don’t have to sweat stuff too much. 

Great. She tells us the price and we all pitch in $150, sending it directly to her to pay the company. Sunday (cleaners were coming Tuesday), I spent the entire day moving things out and cleaning up. The apartment has absolutely no furniture anymore. No couches, no stools, no table, etc. I leave my key behind as Johnny insisted to turn them in early, since I’m done moving. 

I left behind a few things like two full and unused paper towel rolls, some toilet paper in the bathroom, empty garbage bags, a ball of scotch tape on the wall from where I took down decorations, and some condiments in the fridge. I wish I’d grabbed them, but I really was just burnt. 

We hired cleaners so I figured that’s fine.  

Well the next day Johnny spends hours blowing up my phone, angry I left tape behind (which I promise could be grabbed easily, it was just a convenient place to stick it), and stuff in the fridge. 

I told her I thought it was fine considering the cleaners would be coming, but she told me at 10 pm when I finally answered her call to come take care of all of it so the cleaners don’t have “extra work”. 

I don’t want to be an asshole to the cleaners, but my roommate and I obviously did not see eye to eye on this. So I blocked her after saying I didn’t need or want any of the things, and that I wasn’t getting them. I may have but she and I don’t get along and I’ve had a cold recently, Sunday really burnt me since we lived on the third floor with stairs and I was also moving furniture. She had some choice words about being livid. 

She texted me from another number today continuing to berate me. Ignored. Blocked. 

AITA for not going to retrieve the stuff?

I told her I thought it was fine considering the cleaners would be coming, but she told me at 10 pm when I finally answered her call to come take care of all of it so the cleaners don’t have “extra work”. 

I don’t want to be an asshole to the cleaners, but my roommate and I obviously did not see eye to eye on this. So I blocked her after saying I didn’t need or want any of the things, and that I wasn’t getting them. I may have but she and I don’t get along and I’ve had a cold recently, Sunday really burnt me since we lived on the third floor with stairs and I was also moving furniture. She had some choice words about being livid. 

She texted me from another number today continuing to berate me. Ignored. Blocked. 

AITA for not going to retrieve the stuff?

135,1dq7tnq,AITA For telling my sister she can’t drink/eat my food,Recently got into a huge fight with my sister. She provoked me by saying many hurtful things including talking about my income. I haven’t spoken to her since and actively distance myself from her since she moved back in with our family. I recently bought groceries for myself and she decided to help herself to something to drink without asking. I never eat food in the house unless I paid for it. I mentioned out loud “uh I paid for that” and she closed the lid and put it back. It seems like I’m being petty but since she commented about my pay I did it out to prove a point.

136,1dq7sz2,AITA for leaving when my sister came to visit ,"So my sister is 24 I’m 21. I’m not working staying at my boyfriends, my car isn’t currently working so me and my bf are sharing his car. My sister lives about 2 hours away from me and we both have one child, I have a daughter she has a son. My sister has always been very moody, gets rude and overwhelmed easily and likes to boss me around and I always wait till the storm is over and take the cussing and name calling. She is pregnant and I tried to blame her hormones but this has been an issue for our whole lives. She calls me saying she’s coming to my moms house which is a 40 minute drive from my boyfriends house (mind you his gas, his car) she tells me be there early in the morning! It’s not possible for me since my bf gets up before five to go to work unless I want to spend the night at my moms with no way home since he works long shifts and drives all day for work asking him to drive about 3 hours on his work days is inconvenient. So I come over to my moms at 3 in the evening my sister is sleeping so I stay and wait two hours before waking her because honestly I wanted to relax with my bf and daughter not stay with my verbally abusive sister at my moms with no escape. I wake her up and she’s livid. “You’re a liar don’t look at my son! You bitch!” He starts crying I make my daughter go to another room because I think it’s inappropriate to involve children or speak badly of people to children (she’s always telling my nephew we are strangers and things to make him nervous he’s only 2 he’s very happy with me when she’s not around will hug me and all) she starts crying calling me bitch piece of shit everything. My mom had to go to church and whispered I understand if you leave so I left with her not wanting to subject myself to this any longer. She then texts me and tells my whole family she should call cps on me because her son hates me and my daughter loves her so I’m a bad mom and treat my daughter terribly so I block her and my family that believed whatever lies she said and texted me about it. Im in medical school live my daughter she has her own room my bf spoils her she’s very loved.
