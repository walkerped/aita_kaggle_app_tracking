0,1dq6g1i,AITA for obeying traffic laws?,"Background info: I live in the Omaha area.  I am staying in a hotel while I house hunt.  I work on the other side of town from the hotel, a 20m drive  This event happened during evening rush hour, 27JUN24.

  
I am on one of the main highways of the area, NE-370.  There is a small construction area halfway from my turn onto this highway and my turn off of this highway.  it's a divided highway, normally two lanes each direction except for noted construction area.  Traffic on this day was heavy.

I am driving the speed limit.  When we reach the construction area I let a black Honda minivan into my lane.  When both lanes open up I maintain my position in left lane because I will at some point be making a left turn.  In left lane I pass black Honda.  Black Honda winds up behind me.   Black Honda rides my ass.  I maintain speed limit.  I do not speed up, I do not slow down.  I am moving with the flow of traffic while maintaining safe following distance with vehicles in front of me.  While driving thusly I am still passing many vehicles who elected for the right lane.

After five miles or so it is time for my left turn at an intersection.  I use my turn signals to indicate upcoming lane change.  Unlike the local bozos I wait until I am in turning lane to slow down.  As soon as I enter turning lane, black Honda honks his horn at me and I get digitus impudicus.

1,1dq6dll,AITA for how I communicated to my boss that I'm leaving the company?,"I feel horrible. 

So, I'm leaving my current company to join a new one in two weeks. 

Today, I gave my two weeks notice to my boss at my current company. Here's how the interaction went down (paraphrased) - 

Me: Hey, just wanted to let you know that my last day is going to be two weeks from now.

Boss: Why? Are you not happy here? Is the work not good? 

Me: No, it's not that but this is a contract position as you know and I've been looking for something more permanent. I've actually really been enjoying the work and had a great experience. I have offers from two other companies now.

Boss: Ok, I understand. Good luck and congratulations on your offers.

Another co-worker also heard this and congratulated me. I was feeling really good and happy for the next two hours.

Then, once I got off work, my dad called and I told him about this interaction. He revealed something about my conversation with my boss and I think I might have messed up. He said I should have started by saying how much I love working at my current company before saying I'm leaving and what my end date is. That way my boss wouldn't have even had to ask if I'm unhappy. She could have gone straight to congratulating me.

I wish I could go back in time and redo the whole conversation, but I can't. All I can do is learn from this and improve my communication skills in the future if I'm the asshole. Am I the asshole? Or at least an idiot/tone deaf?
