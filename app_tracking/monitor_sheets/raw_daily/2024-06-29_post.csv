0,1dr0pxt,WIBTA If I uninvite my best friend to my birthday party?,"I (20 non-binary) live with my best friend Jane, (fake name, 20 F). We have been friends for about a year and a half and are basically attached at the hip. 

For the last couple months she's been, to put it simply, a bad friend. She will make fun of me, randomly becomes passive aggressive and will be mad at me for some reason, and gets defensive very very quickly. When we are good, it's great. We have a lot of fun and I've laughed harder with her than anyone else. We usually have a good balance of good and bad days, but lately the bad days have outweighed the good.

My 21st birthday is coming up and I decided to throw a small get together. It will literally be me, my two hometown friends, and my roommates (Jand and I live in a three bedroom and have another roommates). Last night, Jane asked me about it. She asked me when I was doing it, who will be there, and what we will do. I had already told her the plan multiple times, but told her again without complaint. She had a strange response to it, and seemed upset for some reason which put a damper on the previously chill mood. 

When introducing my friends to other friends, I always get nervous and am scared they won't get along. Usually though it goes well. However, with Jane, I'm more nervous than usual. She can tend to be judgmental even when someone is doing something normal and mundane. I don't want her to have this kind of attitude when I'm trying to celebrate my birthday, especially with my friends who I haven't seen in a while and mean a lot to me. 

I feel weird telling her not to come since she does live with me, but after talking about it with our other roommate, she thinks I should try to bring it up in a certain way so she doesn't react harshly. My sister thinks that I would be the asshole since Jane and I have been friends for so long and because she would feel unwelcome in her own house. 

I want to stand up for myself finally because it's honestly become embarrassing how much I've let her walk over me, but also I would feel awful. I tend to be really sensitive to other people's feelings, and feel it really strongly with Jane.

1,1dqzdfm,AITA For not picking up my fiance after work?,"My fiance and I just bought a townhome about 30 minutes away from our current apartment.

2,1dqzabz,"AITA for ""calling out"" my friend's friend on my private instagram story?
","I (18M) post a lot on my story about stuff happening in Palestine along with other human rights stuff. At the time this happened, that was all I posted on my story because that's all I really could do. In the area I live, I have desperately searched for protests and there are literally none. Besides calling officials and spreading awareness, there is nothing else I can really do because I also don't have my own money. I say this for background info to hopefully avoid questions about stuff relating to this.

This guy I know (18M) texted me and was pestering me for posting about this stuff I was posting on my own story. I barely ever talked to him, he was just in the same friend group as me. And I never bothered him about not posting stuff on his story. I never went out of my way to text him and ask why he didn't spread awareness or even bother to do anything at all. He was shaming me for spreading awareness when he wasn't. He was asking me why I wasn't doing more when he wasn't doing anything at all. It was really backwards to me. He did this twice until he blocked me.

After this stuff had happened, I posted about it on my close friends story because it annoyed me. I went on a rant about it and called him a rich white boy in an insulting way because (in my opinon) he is a rich white boy who is kind of bigoted. He has said offensive things before and no one has ever pointed it out so I haven't either. If this adds any perspective, he's gay and white so he's kind of one of those guys that thinks he can do no wrong because he's apart of one marginalized group.

One of my closer friends (18F) is close with this guy and was on my close friends list. She had a similar upbringing to his. She is perhaps not as fortunate as he is but she is still apart of a higher class than me and she also happens to be white. When I called him a rich white boy on my story it upset her and she distanced herself from me until she finally told me she didn't want to be friends. This upset me but in the end I don't want to be friends with someone who couldn't face the facts of being rich and white. I don't fault people for being rich or white (because that can't be helped of course) but I think it is really important to acknowledge your own privilege and not let your feelings get hurt when others point out bigoted behavior that was learned from being rich and white. Behaviors that she didn't even possess? It made her upset because she said it made her rethink how I might feel about her.

I don't feel like I am the asshole and neither does my bf or one of my friends that I inquired about this. However, I would like some outside perspective.

I told her I got a bf named Jay and he was treating me so well. She was so happy for me and I kept on lying about it.

Soon, I decided to tell one of my other friends about it and she agreed to be my ""bf"". She made a Tiktok account to make it believable and I kept on lying about it. I kept on saying that he was saying good morning, good night to me, that I would go over to his place, and much more.

Later, I felt bored and realized ""this is kinda wrong yk"" because lying is bad and my life is bad already. I decided to tell my friend that my bf was fake and I was lying. She got so mad at me and I was not expecting it. She told me that she was so hyped up about this and she had already told her friends, she was already deep into this and she was calling me shitty.

Honestly, I get it, I was lying about having a bf but I felt like she overreacted. To be honest, all I did was talk about him and I didn't even talk about him that much.

Context: My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) are from different economic backgrounds but that has never been an issue. He lives with his aunt and is a college student, she is the sole provider for his household and he's been unemployed recently and was very sad from having to depend on her income alone, but couldn't find a job that allowed him to study properly (he is in the medical field). My parents own a small business, so I asked them if they knew of any part time opportunities for him and they offered him a few gigs, such as organising sections in our stock, which isn't that big, and is quite simple.

 He would receive when he finalised each section, which could take from 1 to 3 days, depending on his schedule, he was free to arrange his own time, to take any time he needed off, use his phone, watch movies, do pretty much what he wanted for an actual nice pay (My dad honestly wants to help him out). He started liking coming to help so he's been helping out at the sales part (and being paid, of course).

 He has total flexibility to come or not and at what time, he can get a ride with me and my dad or my parents pay for his transportation and food everyday. We eat together, the same food. Well, now his aunt is upset at us, because she thinks that we are pitying on them because they are poor, so if my bf complains about his knee (he has been complaining for months now) she says it's because he must be standing for too long when working (he actually has his own chair pretty much everywhere) and that she prefers having him at home than being exploited somewhere because they're poor (but then she was complaining that he should stop going to the gym and take another loan to pay for college cause she couldn't afford everything). 

One of the things that might have crossed the line was that my grandma is throwing a birthday party and she asked if we want to help preparing some of the food and serving some drinks to guests when the food is served for a couple hours and she will pays us (me, him, my cousin, my cousins gf, whoever wants to) and I jumped at the opportunity bc extra money!!!

7,1dqymfl,AITA for asking my (19m) friend to stop including my ex (19f) in our friend group?,"My ex girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me over text in May. It is my first time experiencing a breakup. She was dealing with major depression and felt like she wasn't in a good place for a relationship. I was already depressed myself so the breakup was super rough for me, as I was completely blindsided. I tried my best being composed despite the fact that I found her approach and later her actions extremely disrespectful.

In the breakup text, she said that she still loved me and that that she will be the one to tell our friend group that we split. She ended up acting like nothing between us AT ALL ever happened and I had to be the one to tell each one of them, without going into detail.  So she and my friends have the impression that we ended on ""good terms. "" She also mentioned in the text message that she would like me to give her a chance again in the future, this has lingered in my mind. I recently had a conversation with her where I caved in and basically told her that I want proper closure and that I'd be willing to try again in the future. She shut down the whole getting back together thing, and basically told me that in the last month of the relationship she began detaching so that breaking up would be easier for her. This made me loose all respect I had for her. I told her that I don't want her to persist in my social circle anymore, but she got offended and said that I'm just angry that she ""stole my friends."" 

For context, throughout our relationship, she slowly became friends with the people in my friend group. I had no problem with this. However, they are the only friends I have, while my ex was a way more social person and had other friendships. I asked her that in the event that we broke up, that she should let me fall back on my friends as I knew it would be a struggle for me, she never really cared about this. It seems like she feels entitled to have priority over me since for about 2 years I didn't spend as much time with them as I should have due to a combination of my struggle with mental health as well as university. 

I invited them to go to a concert and one of them told me that she is coming along. I had no choice but to have a conversation about my ex with him, where I basically told him everything in this post but with much greater details, and why I think of her as an awful person I don't want in my life anymore. I told him that I really don't want her to be included anymore in our friend group as I don't think its fair how I have to see my ex every time we do anything and act like I'm okay with that.

TLDR: Ex of 2 years is in my friend group, I don't want her to be but I don't know if its even fair of me to want that. I had to tell one of my friends to stop including her in our group. Is it fucked up that I involved him in my problems? Not only that but am I really in the right for expressing to him the image I have of her, that is one of a shitty person?

",Asshole,2024-06-29,"AITA for asking my (19m) friend to stop including my ex (19f) in our friend group? My ex girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me over text in May. It is my first time experiencing a breakup. She was dealing with major depression and felt like she wasn't in a good place for a relationship. I was already depressed myself so the breakup was super rough for me, as I was completely blindsided. I tried my best being composed despite the fact that I found her approach and later her actions extremely disrespectful.

In the breakup text, she said that she still loved me and that that she will be the one to tell our friend group that we split. She ended up acting like nothing between us AT ALL ever happened and I had to be the one to tell each one of them, without going into detail.  So she and my friends have the impression that we ended on ""good terms. "" She also mentioned in the text message that she would like me to give her a chance again in the future, this has lingered in my mind. I recently had a conversation with her where I caved in and basically told her that I want proper closure and that I'd be willing to try again in the future. She shut down the whole getting back together thing, and basically told me that in the last month of the relationship she began detaching so that breaking up would be easier for her. This made me loose all respect I had for her. I told her that I don't want her to persist in my social circle anymore, but she got offended and said that I'm just angry that she ""stole my friends."" 

For context, throughout our relationship, she slowly became friends with the people in my friend group. I had no problem with this. However, they are the only friends I have, while my ex was a way more social person and had other friendships. I asked her that in the event that we broke up, that she should let me fall back on my friends as I knew it would be a struggle for me, she never really cared about this. It seems like she feels entitled to have priority over me since for about 2 years I didn't spend as much time with them as I should have due to a combination of my struggle with mental health as well as university. 

I invited them to go to a concert and one of them told me that she is coming along. I had no choice but to have a conversation about my ex with him, where I basically told him everything in this post but with much greater details, and why I think of her as an awful person I don't want in my life anymore. I told him that I really don't want her to be included anymore in our friend group as I don't think its fair how I have to see my ex every time we do anything and act like I'm okay with that.

TLDR: Ex of 2 years is in my friend group, I don't want her to be but I don't know if its even fair of me to want that. I had to tell one of my friends to stop including her in our group. Is it fucked up that I involved him in my problems? Not only that but am I really in the right for expressing to him the image I have of her, that is one of a shitty person?

9,1dqyai5,WIBTA if I make a copy of a missing key to the front door and disregard my parents' insistence that I move out somewhere while they go on a two-week vacation?,"I (21M) currently live in a house with my parents (45M, 44F) and siblings (11M, 6F). I am autistic and experience pretty severe mental health issues. I go to a psychiatrist and applied for disability benefits, but my parents don't like it. They believe the meds are addictive drugs, and what are manifestations of my disease are just attempts at manipulation. They only speak to me if they have a problem, I don't speak to my family, and I have very few friends.

I want to be left alone, but my parents won't do that. Not even when I found a job despite struggling with my issues (before that they grilled me daily for not having one, which caused a lot of meltdowns). I started paying rent for my room once I could afford it, they accepted it for two months then just returned the money and rebuked me for the very idea of sending it (which I have to as per the country's Civil Code).

We argue often about cleanliness in my room. I'm a bit of a slob and I **hate** cleaning, but I try to make it OK so as to please my parents. That's never good enough. However hard I try, they will always find dust somewhere and tell I just half-assed it, which makes me super upset and I cry hard. They tell me my room smells, but I never feel it. They even strong-armed me into buying a wardrobe I never needed because they didn't want to see two stacks of my clothes in the open, and also forbade using the washing mashine so I have to go to the closest laundry **an hour away** just to wash my clothes (just throwing into the pile of all dirty clothes for my mum to put there is apparently disrespectful of her).

So the other day I lost my keys, and I had 2h meltdown because of that and I punished myself hard. I had to spend most of my bonus on buying new locks. They changed the upper but not the lower one, so I can't open it. Therefore, when I come back from errands, a couple of times I was locked out because of the lower lock. The parents' reaction was basically oops, sorry.

Sometime later, while I'm at work, my SF opens my pull-out sofa for no reason (random cleanliness check?) and finds an empty carton of milk I'd forgotten about. No roaches. I apologized and confessed. When I return, he tells that I'd have to find some accommodation while they go on vacation (""I can't entrust you with the house if you forget about the trash""). A couple of days later, he changes the reason to my condition, or rather, my ""manipulations"". He says that since I can afford moving while they're out, so I'd have to. He threatens to call 112 if I ""trespass"" on the house. (I'm not mentioned as an inhabitant there 'cause I was first sent to boarding school when I was 15 and then uni dorms).

I believe all of it is just inventing a BS excuse to force me to spend my money (see wardrobe and the laundry) and just to make my life hard for unknown reasons. I need to stay until early Sep so that I can move to a dorm, and the moving back would be disruptive for me, but they have none of it.

10,1dqy88m,AITA Private Swim Lessons in a community pool,"Sorry, this is on my phone. I've had some mixed opinions so I wanted to ask here. 

I took my kids, niece, and nephew to my community pool yesterday. It's really hot where I live and kids are out of school, so the pool is usually pretty busy. I'd say roughly 15 to 20 kids at a time in there. Plus an adult or two that brought them. 

There's 4 sets of steps entering the pool so we usually pick a corner to sit at (table or chairs) and I'll let the kids swim. They aren't out of control and will respect people who are just lounging, but they're also kids who are in water. There will be splashing, intentional or nit.

I picked a table and set my stuff down. The kids go in and I'm watching. In the same area is a woman with a child who is about a year old. Not even 5 minutes later my oldest child is telling me that the lady told them they needed to move to the other side of the pool. 

I look over and can now hear her telling my other kids that she's giving the baby a swim lesson and they needed to move. She didn't ask. She demanded. 

I told my son no and to keep swimming. First, we do have lessons offered through our community center and she didn't work for them (I eventually asked). Second, private lessons aren't allowed, although you can bring in whatever guests you want. Third, this was at noon. Probably the busiest time of day to be at the pool.

If the family wanted to teach their child to swim why not come on a day where they can be there at 8am? The pool is heated and practically empty. 

I held my ground for a bit, but eventually agreed to scoot my kids over to the other stairs (not the opposite end of the pool). Only because she started to raise her voice and that poor baby got scared. He was crying so hard and none of it was his fault. I felt really bad about that so we moved. 

So AITAH for not initiallymoving?
