0,1dr0pxt,WIBTA If I uninvite my best friend to my birthday party?,"I (20 non-binary) live with my best friend Jane, (fake name, 20 F). We have been friends for about a year and a half and are basically attached at the hip. 

For the last couple months she's been, to put it simply, a bad friend. She will make fun of me, randomly becomes passive aggressive and will be mad at me for some reason, and gets defensive very very quickly. When we are good, it's great. We have a lot of fun and I've laughed harder with her than anyone else. We usually have a good balance of good and bad days, but lately the bad days have outweighed the good.

My 21st birthday is coming up and I decided to throw a small get together. It will literally be me, my two hometown friends, and my roommates (Jand and I live in a three bedroom and have another roommates). Last night, Jane asked me about it. She asked me when I was doing it, who will be there, and what we will do. I had already told her the plan multiple times, but told her again without complaint. She had a strange response to it, and seemed upset for some reason which put a damper on the previously chill mood. 

When introducing my friends to other friends, I always get nervous and am scared they won't get along. Usually though it goes well. However, with Jane, I'm more nervous than usual. She can tend to be judgmental even when someone is doing something normal and mundane. I don't want her to have this kind of attitude when I'm trying to celebrate my birthday, especially with my friends who I haven't seen in a while and mean a lot to me. 

I feel weird telling her not to come since she does live with me, but after talking about it with our other roommate, she thinks I should try to bring it up in a certain way so she doesn't react harshly. My sister thinks that I would be the asshole since Jane and I have been friends for so long and because she would feel unwelcome in her own house. 

I want to stand up for myself finally because it's honestly become embarrassing how much I've let her walk over me, but also I would feel awful. I tend to be really sensitive to other people's feelings, and feel it really strongly with Jane.

1,1dqzdfm,AITA For not picking up my fiance after work?,"My fiance and I just bought a townhome about 30 minutes away from our current apartment.

2,1dqzabz,"AITA for ""calling out"" my friend's friend on my private instagram story?
","I (18M) post a lot on my story about stuff happening in Palestine along with other human rights stuff. At the time this happened, that was all I posted on my story because that's all I really could do. In the area I live, I have desperately searched for protests and there are literally none. Besides calling officials and spreading awareness, there is nothing else I can really do because I also don't have my own money. I say this for background info to hopefully avoid questions about stuff relating to this.

This guy I know (18M) texted me and was pestering me for posting about this stuff I was posting on my own story. I barely ever talked to him, he was just in the same friend group as me. And I never bothered him about not posting stuff on his story. I never went out of my way to text him and ask why he didn't spread awareness or even bother to do anything at all. He was shaming me for spreading awareness when he wasn't. He was asking me why I wasn't doing more when he wasn't doing anything at all. It was really backwards to me. He did this twice until he blocked me.

After this stuff had happened, I posted about it on my close friends story because it annoyed me. I went on a rant about it and called him a rich white boy in an insulting way because (in my opinon) he is a rich white boy who is kind of bigoted. He has said offensive things before and no one has ever pointed it out so I haven't either. If this adds any perspective, he's gay and white so he's kind of one of those guys that thinks he can do no wrong because he's apart of one marginalized group.

One of my closer friends (18F) is close with this guy and was on my close friends list. She had a similar upbringing to his. She is perhaps not as fortunate as he is but she is still apart of a higher class than me and she also happens to be white. When I called him a rich white boy on my story it upset her and she distanced herself from me until she finally told me she didn't want to be friends. This upset me but in the end I don't want to be friends with someone who couldn't face the facts of being rich and white. I don't fault people for being rich or white (because that can't be helped of course) but I think it is really important to acknowledge your own privilege and not let your feelings get hurt when others point out bigoted behavior that was learned from being rich and white. Behaviors that she didn't even possess? It made her upset because she said it made her rethink how I might feel about her.

I don't feel like I am the asshole and neither does my bf or one of my friends that I inquired about this. However, I would like some outside perspective.

I told her I got a bf named Jay and he was treating me so well. She was so happy for me and I kept on lying about it.

Soon, I decided to tell one of my other friends about it and she agreed to be my ""bf"". She made a Tiktok account to make it believable and I kept on lying about it. I kept on saying that he was saying good morning, good night to me, that I would go over to his place, and much more.

Later, I felt bored and realized ""this is kinda wrong yk"" because lying is bad and my life is bad already. I decided to tell my friend that my bf was fake and I was lying. She got so mad at me and I was not expecting it. She told me that she was so hyped up about this and she had already told her friends, she was already deep into this and she was calling me shitty.

Honestly, I get it, I was lying about having a bf but I felt like she overreacted. To be honest, all I did was talk about him and I didn't even talk about him that much.

Context: My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) are from different economic backgrounds but that has never been an issue. He lives with his aunt and is a college student, she is the sole provider for his household and he's been unemployed recently and was very sad from having to depend on her income alone, but couldn't find a job that allowed him to study properly (he is in the medical field). My parents own a small business, so I asked them if they knew of any part time opportunities for him and they offered him a few gigs, such as organising sections in our stock, which isn't that big, and is quite simple.

 He would receive when he finalised each section, which could take from 1 to 3 days, depending on his schedule, he was free to arrange his own time, to take any time he needed off, use his phone, watch movies, do pretty much what he wanted for an actual nice pay (My dad honestly wants to help him out). He started liking coming to help so he's been helping out at the sales part (and being paid, of course).

 He has total flexibility to come or not and at what time, he can get a ride with me and my dad or my parents pay for his transportation and food everyday. We eat together, the same food. Well, now his aunt is upset at us, because she thinks that we are pitying on them because they are poor, so if my bf complains about his knee (he has been complaining for months now) she says it's because he must be standing for too long when working (he actually has his own chair pretty much everywhere) and that she prefers having him at home than being exploited somewhere because they're poor (but then she was complaining that he should stop going to the gym and take another loan to pay for college cause she couldn't afford everything). 

One of the things that might have crossed the line was that my grandma is throwing a birthday party and she asked if we want to help preparing some of the food and serving some drinks to guests when the food is served for a couple hours and she will pays us (me, him, my cousin, my cousins gf, whoever wants to) and I jumped at the opportunity bc extra money!!!

7,1dqymfl,AITA for asking my (19m) friend to stop including my ex (19f) in our friend group?,"My ex girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me over text in May. It is my first time experiencing a breakup. She was dealing with major depression and felt like she wasn't in a good place for a relationship. I was already depressed myself so the breakup was super rough for me, as I was completely blindsided. I tried my best being composed despite the fact that I found her approach and later her actions extremely disrespectful.

In the breakup text, she said that she still loved me and that that she will be the one to tell our friend group that we split. She ended up acting like nothing between us AT ALL ever happened and I had to be the one to tell each one of them, without going into detail.  So she and my friends have the impression that we ended on ""good terms. "" She also mentioned in the text message that she would like me to give her a chance again in the future, this has lingered in my mind. I recently had a conversation with her where I caved in and basically told her that I want proper closure and that I'd be willing to try again in the future. She shut down the whole getting back together thing, and basically told me that in the last month of the relationship she began detaching so that breaking up would be easier for her. This made me loose all respect I had for her. I told her that I don't want her to persist in my social circle anymore, but she got offended and said that I'm just angry that she ""stole my friends."" 

For context, throughout our relationship, she slowly became friends with the people in my friend group. I had no problem with this. However, they are the only friends I have, while my ex was a way more social person and had other friendships. I asked her that in the event that we broke up, that she should let me fall back on my friends as I knew it would be a struggle for me, she never really cared about this. It seems like she feels entitled to have priority over me since for about 2 years I didn't spend as much time with them as I should have due to a combination of my struggle with mental health as well as university. 

I invited them to go to a concert and one of them told me that she is coming along. I had no choice but to have a conversation about my ex with him, where I basically told him everything in this post but with much greater details, and why I think of her as an awful person I don't want in my life anymore. I told him that I really don't want her to be included anymore in our friend group as I don't think its fair how I have to see my ex every time we do anything and act like I'm okay with that.

TLDR: Ex of 2 years is in my friend group, I don't want her to be but I don't know if its even fair of me to want that. I had to tell one of my friends to stop including her in our group. Is it fucked up that I involved him in my problems? Not only that but am I really in the right for expressing to him the image I have of her, that is one of a shitty person?

",Asshole,2024-06-29,"AITA for asking my (19m) friend to stop including my ex (19f) in our friend group? My ex girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me over text in May. It is my first time experiencing a breakup. She was dealing with major depression and felt like she wasn't in a good place for a relationship. I was already depressed myself so the breakup was super rough for me, as I was completely blindsided. I tried my best being composed despite the fact that I found her approach and later her actions extremely disrespectful.

In the breakup text, she said that she still loved me and that that she will be the one to tell our friend group that we split. She ended up acting like nothing between us AT ALL ever happened and I had to be the one to tell each one of them, without going into detail.  So she and my friends have the impression that we ended on ""good terms. "" She also mentioned in the text message that she would like me to give her a chance again in the future, this has lingered in my mind. I recently had a conversation with her where I caved in and basically told her that I want proper closure and that I'd be willing to try again in the future. She shut down the whole getting back together thing, and basically told me that in the last month of the relationship she began detaching so that breaking up would be easier for her. This made me loose all respect I had for her. I told her that I don't want her to persist in my social circle anymore, but she got offended and said that I'm just angry that she ""stole my friends."" 

For context, throughout our relationship, she slowly became friends with the people in my friend group. I had no problem with this. However, they are the only friends I have, while my ex was a way more social person and had other friendships. I asked her that in the event that we broke up, that she should let me fall back on my friends as I knew it would be a struggle for me, she never really cared about this. It seems like she feels entitled to have priority over me since for about 2 years I didn't spend as much time with them as I should have due to a combination of my struggle with mental health as well as university. 

I invited them to go to a concert and one of them told me that she is coming along. I had no choice but to have a conversation about my ex with him, where I basically told him everything in this post but with much greater details, and why I think of her as an awful person I don't want in my life anymore. I told him that I really don't want her to be included anymore in our friend group as I don't think its fair how I have to see my ex every time we do anything and act like I'm okay with that.

TLDR: Ex of 2 years is in my friend group, I don't want her to be but I don't know if its even fair of me to want that. I had to tell one of my friends to stop including her in our group. Is it fucked up that I involved him in my problems? Not only that but am I really in the right for expressing to him the image I have of her, that is one of a shitty person?

9,1dqyai5,WIBTA if I make a copy of a missing key to the front door and disregard my parents' insistence that I move out somewhere while they go on a two-week vacation?,"I (21M) currently live in a house with my parents (45M, 44F) and siblings (11M, 6F). I am autistic and experience pretty severe mental health issues. I go to a psychiatrist and applied for disability benefits, but my parents don't like it. They believe the meds are addictive drugs, and what are manifestations of my disease are just attempts at manipulation. They only speak to me if they have a problem, I don't speak to my family, and I have very few friends.

I want to be left alone, but my parents won't do that. Not even when I found a job despite struggling with my issues (before that they grilled me daily for not having one, which caused a lot of meltdowns). I started paying rent for my room once I could afford it, they accepted it for two months then just returned the money and rebuked me for the very idea of sending it (which I have to as per the country's Civil Code).

We argue often about cleanliness in my room. I'm a bit of a slob and I **hate** cleaning, but I try to make it OK so as to please my parents. That's never good enough. However hard I try, they will always find dust somewhere and tell I just half-assed it, which makes me super upset and I cry hard. They tell me my room smells, but I never feel it. They even strong-armed me into buying a wardrobe I never needed because they didn't want to see two stacks of my clothes in the open, and also forbade using the washing mashine so I have to go to the closest laundry **an hour away** just to wash my clothes (just throwing into the pile of all dirty clothes for my mum to put there is apparently disrespectful of her).

So the other day I lost my keys, and I had 2h meltdown because of that and I punished myself hard. I had to spend most of my bonus on buying new locks. They changed the upper but not the lower one, so I can't open it. Therefore, when I come back from errands, a couple of times I was locked out because of the lower lock. The parents' reaction was basically oops, sorry.

Sometime later, while I'm at work, my SF opens my pull-out sofa for no reason (random cleanliness check?) and finds an empty carton of milk I'd forgotten about. No roaches. I apologized and confessed. When I return, he tells that I'd have to find some accommodation while they go on vacation (""I can't entrust you with the house if you forget about the trash""). A couple of days later, he changes the reason to my condition, or rather, my ""manipulations"". He says that since I can afford moving while they're out, so I'd have to. He threatens to call 112 if I ""trespass"" on the house. (I'm not mentioned as an inhabitant there 'cause I was first sent to boarding school when I was 15 and then uni dorms).

I believe all of it is just inventing a BS excuse to force me to spend my money (see wardrobe and the laundry) and just to make my life hard for unknown reasons. I need to stay until early Sep so that I can move to a dorm, and the moving back would be disruptive for me, but they have none of it.

10,1dqy88m,AITA Private Swim Lessons in a community pool,"Sorry, this is on my phone. I've had some mixed opinions so I wanted to ask here. 

I took my kids, niece, and nephew to my community pool yesterday. It's really hot where I live and kids are out of school, so the pool is usually pretty busy. I'd say roughly 15 to 20 kids at a time in there. Plus an adult or two that brought them. 

There's 4 sets of steps entering the pool so we usually pick a corner to sit at (table or chairs) and I'll let the kids swim. They aren't out of control and will respect people who are just lounging, but they're also kids who are in water. There will be splashing, intentional or nit.

I picked a table and set my stuff down. The kids go in and I'm watching. In the same area is a woman with a child who is about a year old. Not even 5 minutes later my oldest child is telling me that the lady told them they needed to move to the other side of the pool. 

I look over and can now hear her telling my other kids that she's giving the baby a swim lesson and they needed to move. She didn't ask. She demanded. 

I told my son no and to keep swimming. First, we do have lessons offered through our community center and she didn't work for them (I eventually asked). Second, private lessons aren't allowed, although you can bring in whatever guests you want. Third, this was at noon. Probably the busiest time of day to be at the pool.

If the family wanted to teach their child to swim why not come on a day where they can be there at 8am? The pool is heated and practically empty. 

I held my ground for a bit, but eventually agreed to scoot my kids over to the other stairs (not the opposite end of the pool). Only because she started to raise her voice and that poor baby got scared. He was crying so hard and none of it was his fault. I felt really bad about that so we moved. 

So AITAH for not initiallymoving?

There are a couple factors that might make me TA, however. Firstly, Nate isn‚Äôt old enough to drive, so he needs a way to get to and from his sports practice. However he has many friends who can drive, so I feel like it would be easy to arrange a carpool.

Today my parents asked me if I could request off three consecutive days in July to babysit my brothers, and I really don‚Äôt want to. For starters, I already have to take off five consecutive days close to the dates for my second job. They also said they‚Äôd pay me a ‚Äúnanny fee‚Äù, but based on what they‚Äôve paid me for babysitting in the past, it won‚Äôt be nearly as much as I would get working for those three days. Lastly, the day they said they ‚Äúneeded me the most‚Äù is coincidentally my birthday, which I don‚Äôt think they realized. I didn‚Äôt have any special plans for my birthday, but it hurt a little that they either forgot or didn‚Äôt think to ask if I had plans.

17,1drnora,AITA for ruining our family trip over matching outfits?,"**tl;dr**¬†- I think my SILs intentionally left me out of matching family outfits on our trip & got upset; they said it was all in my head. AITA?

I just got back from our annual family trip & created this account to figure out if I am the A\*\*\* because I can't tell anymore.

My husband and I have been together for 15 years, and his family has a history of excluding me and our second kid from events. This year, we went on a 6-day cruise. A neighbor/friend booked the same cruise last minute. I made sure both my SILs knew they were coming.

One SIL (Jane) loves matching outfits, so we picked out swimsuits for the kids and an outfit for the kids to take photos in. I asked if adults were matching and was told no. On the first day, both Jane & my other SIL (Cindy) showed up in matching dresses with their husbands in almost identical outfits. They shrugged it off and said they just forgot to tell me.

The next day was my kid's birthday. At breakfast, my SILs disappeared with our kids and my friend‚Äôs kid without a word. When they returned, they dismissed my concerns and left again to eat lunch without us. We joined them later, but it was clear we were not included in their plans. They showed up for our dinner plans in matching outfits again and, again, we did not get the memo.

By the third day, everyone, including my friend, was in coordinated outfits except my family. When I confronted my SILs, they denied everything and blamed me for overthinking and moving to slowly. They said I made everyone miserable and that I was aggressive for expressing my hurt feelings.

The rest of the trip was awkward. I felt excluded and hurt, and now I fear there will be fallout with my MIL and the whole family. AITA for feeling upset and confronting them?

I planned to have a celebration with my small circle of friends with family and my bf (20) however due to a holiday, two of my friends would not be able to come to the planned party. To make up it to me, they had arranged a surprise celebration and it was very successful. I was definitely not expecting it and had no idea even though a few people involved slipped up. They came with balloons, my favourite foods, and my bf gave me pink roses (my fav color). We had fun, had a lot of food, and I felt very loved and appreciated. 

2 days later my actual birthday comes. I was very excited, even thought I had already celebrated. However, I soon felt very sad because by midnight my bf still hasn't greeted me. Last year he greeted me at exactly 12 midnight with a very sweet message, and he also knows it's important to me to be greeted that crazy early. By 12:06, I hinted at him by saying ""you're 6 minutes late"", and he replied with ""wdym?"" I thought he was joking because that's how he usually is. And so I let it go. By \~12:45, we facetimed and I expected he would finally greet me and that it would be the first thing he would say. However, he immediately started talking about something unrelated which really upset me. I thought he was doing it on purpose so it was trying to ignore to see if he would eventually greet me. When I realized he was not joking, I was visibly upset. Finally, he greets me but I was already over it, so I told him I don't want it anymore and it seemed like he only greeted me because he saw other people starting to wish me a happy birthday. 

He starts asking me what was wrong and so I told him. He greeted me too late when last year he was the first person to wish me a happy birthday. He said he saw nothing wrong as he already wished me a happy birthday 2 days prior during my surprise party. I told him I cared more about today because it's my actual birthday. He then says he shouldn't have come to my party if my actual birthday mattered to me more. I lost it there. I said ""Are your greetings limited? Can you only greet me once?"". He said ""I was gonna greet you in the morning"" I replied ""what for when we're already talking now?"" He started greeting me then but I said ""if you're gonna force it I don't want it"". I was still visibly upset so it ruined the mood of our call. He then slept on me without saying goodnight or trying to solve our argument.

She knew how my dad felt about the whole situation and she still went to meet this guy, but he found out about my dad and stopped seeing her. This happened SEVERAL times and when my dad brought up how it made him feel she turned it into an argument.

Her excuse for this? She was 'fed up'. She even told my dad he owed her 5k in bills that she paid out of her grandmother's inheritance when my dad was in recovery and couldn't work. 


I have blocked her on everything (even emails) and I have refused to talk to her for months. My dad still wants to stay with her, and says that I am making it very difficult for him not speaking to her.

21,1drmdgb,AITA for telling my friend that she is making her fianc√© miserable.,"I (21F) recently got into a pretty heated argument with my friend (22F) regarding her engagement to her fianc√© (30M). 

For some background info, me and my friend (Carrie) have been on and off friends since middle school, but over the last 3 years, have become really close and I would consider her a best friend. I love her, but she is definitely one to be dramatic and overreactive. I‚Äôve always thought that, but it has been overwhelmingly hard to handle for the past year. 

About a year into her relationship with her fianc√© (Shawn) she started to obsess over the idea of getting engaged. She would constantly ask friends and family if Shawn had mentioned wanting to propose, would go through his bags during every trip they took to see if he had a ring hidden somewhere, and would sob to Shawn and anyone who would listen after any major holiday or event, wondering why he wouldn‚Äôt propose because it was the ‚Äúperfect opportunity‚Äù. 

During a night out with Shawn, Carrie, and one of his friends, Carrie texted me begging for me to talk to Shawn privately about when he was going to propose. Knowing she wouldn‚Äôt drop it, I texted Shawn and said at some point that night, I would need to talk to him. Eventually, I got him alone and explained that he didn‚Äôt need to tell me anything, but that Carrie wanted me to ask about thoughts on engagement. He told me that he‚Äôs gotten to the point where he is going to propose to make her happy and that it will be about two months from when our convo took place.
 
Now, they are engaged, but the issues have not gone away. Now Carrie is obsessed with wedding planning and Shawn has shared with me that he feels overwhelmed by her even more so now. Shawn isn‚Äôt allowed to go out for drinks once a week after work or play videos games like he usually does because of the wedding. 
Yesterday, I was over at their shared place because Shawn was golfing and Carrie didn‚Äôt want to be alone. At one point, she looked at his location, then pulled up a map of the golf course online and asked me to help her figure out what hole he was on. I told her it looked like he was on hole eight, which upset her because he had already been golfing for awhile and she assumed he would be close to done. She proceeded to call him 32 times in a row until he answered, and then sobbed when he picked up and told him he needed to come home now, because he had been out for too long. After their argument over the phone, I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from the comment I made which was: don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre making Shawn a little miserable? 

This obviously didn‚Äôt go over well, she sobbed and yelled at me, saying I just didn‚Äôt understand how much she loves him. 

I left and we haven‚Äôt talked in a couple days. I regret what I said, but I don‚Äôt necessarily think I‚Äôm wrong. My overall concern is that I have definitely become too involved in their relationship, I have definitely become the middle man.

23,1drm863,AITA for for not caring about a debt to my friend?,"Today, I had an unpleasant experience with a close friend, Tom, and I'm confused about whether I did something wrong. Here‚Äôs what happened:

About two months ago, Tom and I, along with some other university students, went on a short vacation. During the trip, we all ended up owing each other money for food and alcohol, but no one sorted it out at the time.

After the trip, three people owed me money: two of them around 40 euros each, and Tom owed me 120 euros. One person paid me back right away, but the other two, including Tom, haven‚Äôt paid me back yet. It hasn‚Äôt been a big deal for me, but here‚Äôs where the issue begins.

Two weeks ago, I saw Tom, and he complained that no one had paid him back for the money they owe him (around 200 euros). He said I was part of the problem because I wasn‚Äôt encouraging everyone to settle the expenses. I told him I had tried to initiate it twice after the trip, but no one seemed interested. Since only Tom and one other person owe me money, I figured I‚Äôd just settle with them directly. Tom got upset and said I only care about myself and my money. I told him I understand it‚Äôs frustrating and I can back him up if he needs me to, but I won‚Äôt try to initiate it again since no one seemed to care before, including him.

Yesterday, I saw Tom again, and he mentioned the money situation. He said he would pay me back soon, as he's waiting for a paycheck. I haven‚Äôt been pushing him to pay me back‚ÄîI mentioned it twice after the trip and once two weeks ago. I suggested he send a message about the money in our group chat since we‚Äôre unlikely to all gather together until after summer. He didn‚Äôt like that idea, saying everyone would just ignore the message.

Today, Tom came over, and we were having a nice time playing video games. He mentioned the money situation again. He said he calculated how much one of the people (the same second person that owes me as well) owes him exactly, which was 40 euros. He asked me to ask that person for the 40 euros in addition to what is owed to me and then he would send me the rest. I told him no, that‚Äôs between him and the other person. He got upset and said I was making a big deal out of nothing, and if the guy didn‚Äôt pay me, he would have texted him as well.

Tom then said I spat in his face for saying I don‚Äôt care how he pays me. He accused me of only caring about myself and being a bad friend. He said he‚Äôd change the streaming password I‚Äôve been using and that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre done.‚Äù He said he‚Äôll send me the money tomorrow and doesn‚Äôt want to see me again.

I genuinely don‚Äôt understand what I did wrong, because I don't think it's my responsibility to ask other people for money that is owed to him. I feel really bad because he is a close friend and I don't want to upset him. So, am I the asshole?

P.S. I can clarify or follow up on anything if you need more information. I would appreciate any feedback because I consider him a good friend, and he seemed very angry.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-29,"AITA for for not caring about a debt to my friend? Today, I had an unpleasant experience with a close friend, Tom, and I'm confused about whether I did something wrong. Here‚Äôs what happened:

About two months ago, Tom and I, along with some other university students, went on a short vacation. During the trip, we all ended up owing each other money for food and alcohol, but no one sorted it out at the time.

After the trip, three people owed me money: two of them around 40 euros each, and Tom owed me 120 euros. One person paid me back right away, but the other two, including Tom, haven‚Äôt paid me back yet. It hasn‚Äôt been a big deal for me, but here‚Äôs where the issue begins.

Two weeks ago, I saw Tom, and he complained that no one had paid him back for the money they owe him (around 200 euros). He said I was part of the problem because I wasn‚Äôt encouraging everyone to settle the expenses. I told him I had tried to initiate it twice after the trip, but no one seemed interested. Since only Tom and one other person owe me money, I figured I‚Äôd just settle with them directly. Tom got upset and said I only care about myself and my money. I told him I understand it‚Äôs frustrating and I can back him up if he needs me to, but I won‚Äôt try to initiate it again since no one seemed to care before, including him.

Yesterday, I saw Tom again, and he mentioned the money situation. He said he would pay me back soon, as he's waiting for a paycheck. I haven‚Äôt been pushing him to pay me back‚ÄîI mentioned it twice after the trip and once two weeks ago. I suggested he send a message about the money in our group chat since we‚Äôre unlikely to all gather together until after summer. He didn‚Äôt like that idea, saying everyone would just ignore the message.

Today, Tom came over, and we were having a nice time playing video games. He mentioned the money situation again. He said he calculated how much one of the people (the same second person that owes me as well) owes him exactly, which was 40 euros. He asked me to ask that person for the 40 euros in addition to what is owed to me and then he would send me the rest. I told him no, that‚Äôs between him and the other person. He got upset and said I was making a big deal out of nothing, and if the guy didn‚Äôt pay me, he would have texted him as well.

Tom then said I spat in his face for saying I don‚Äôt care how he pays me. He accused me of only caring about myself and being a bad friend. He said he‚Äôd change the streaming password I‚Äôve been using and that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre done.‚Äù He said he‚Äôll send me the money tomorrow and doesn‚Äôt want to see me again.

I genuinely don‚Äôt understand what I did wrong, because I don't think it's my responsibility to ask other people for money that is owed to him. I feel really bad because he is a close friend and I don't want to upset him. So, am I the asshole?

25,1drm1oo,AITA for not attending my best friend's wedding?,"My friend [27/f] asked me [28/f] to be one of her bridesmaids for her wedding. She was my maid of honor two years ago, and before that, we'd always say we'd be each other's maid of honor (we've been friends for 20 years). When she asked me to be a bridesmaid, it stung a bit, to be honest, but seeing as she has a twin sister that she is close to, it made sense that she should be her maid of honor.

The issue I really had with this is that at one point, before I did barely anything as a bridesmaid, she told me, ""You don't have to stand with the other bridesmaid's during the wedding."" ¬†I found it weird that she was saying that, but I replied, ""no, I want to be there with all of you"". After a bit of back and forth, she admitted she doesn't want me standing there with everyone because of my fear of being the center of attention and my social anxiety.

She was worried that I would have a panic attack just like I did standing there at my own wedding. Honestly, it was bad during my wedding because I was shaking and couldn't breathe, and everyone's terrified reaction made it even worse for me. I had to leave and come back to just me, my husband, and my mother to continue our vows and such while everyone else moved on to the reception. I couldn't even go join them until I was drunk enough to not feel embarrassed.

I've been to therapy since then and have made huge progress regarding my social anxiety and my best friend knows this. I felt hurt that she didn't trust me enough to let me stand with the others. I told her I was so much calmer and less anxious now, and I won't even be the center of attention like I was when I was the bride. She said she acknowledged my improvement but just doesn't want to take chances.

She said she doesn't want to embarrass me again and that she would just feel worried about me the whole time, and was also worried that I would ruin the mood of the wedding if I did happen to have a panic attack. I eventually told her that I'd just rather be a guest if I can't do all the bridesmaid stuff. On the day of her wedding, I was just so sick to my stomach with hurt and sadness that I was merely going as a guest to her wedding that I just decided not to go because I felt so left out.

Now she is very mad at me for making her feel bad at her wedding. She thinks I was trying to hurt her and make her feel guilty because of what she thinks was a reasonable request. I didn't mean to hurt her but I just couldn't go because I was overwhelmed with hurt. The people I've talked to are all divided on who is the asshole in this situation.

Ever since i can remember we host family gatherings at my mom house every weekend and as her daughter not attending is not an option.

I have this aunt, nobody likes her she‚Äôs rude, a bully and was never nice to me i have so many traumas from the way she used to treat me as a kid i try my best to avoid her and avoid her daughters they are awful and unbearable. Please understand this is not my own personal opinion but literally everyone in our extended family hates this aunt execept my mom, and when ever i try to explain to my mom why nobody likes her she wont listen or would give excuses.

So me and my cousins formed a private texting group to talk and sometimes gossip, i know its toxic and unhealthy but its nice to have people to vent for, we all enjoy these family gatherings we actually want to come and have fun with family and cousins but her energy just drain the place so we kind of ignore her and pretend to be nice then talk bad about her in the group 

Gathering without her is not an option i cant not see her. 

Last Friday her daughter took my phone behind my back and found the group, took pictures with her phone, sent it to her mom and sisters.

She even said that if my dad found out, he‚Äôd divorce her, and it would be my fault.

I don‚Äôt have many memories of her taking care of me. It was usually our maid or my grandpa who looked after me. My parents fight a lot, and my dad has cheated on her. When I found out about the cheating, it didn‚Äôt shock me much because they‚Äôre always fighting. I‚Äôve wished they‚Äôd divorce because it just doesn‚Äôt seem healthy for anyone, but they haven‚Äôt.

A big part of their issues is my dad‚Äôs family hating my mom. She‚Äôs from a small town up north, and his family, who have some money, always looked down on her. They even made comments that my sister would be born with dark skin because our grandpa is tan. My dad finally cut them off when my sister was born in 2014, but they reconnected a few months ago.

My father hasn‚Äôt always worked abroad. He‚Äôs an Environmental engineer. He mostly supervises the safety of the people when they‚Äôre either making bridges or in copper extractions and things like that. He has 2 jobs, but the most important takes 2.5 weeks and the other one about 3 days. When I was young, there was one year he got a really good job, and stayed with us and was even home for dinner. The problem is that they closed (actually sold? Don‚Äôt remember) the company, shortened the salary and my dad was done. Since then he‚Äôs only worked abroad. I wish they didn‚Äôt close it (or sell it). He would have stayed more around.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I‚Äôve had 4 maids before. My grandma used to not treat them the best. We don‚Äôt have a maid currently.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I‚Äôve lived with my grandparents my whole life, my mother in there too and my dad also when he was off work. We lived there all the way up till my sister was born, and my grandpa passed 3 months after she was born. One of the main reasons for leaving was that everyone was fighting back then. My grandpfather hadn‚Äôt left a will and me and my sister were the only grandchildren back then. My parents just took their things and got away. They didn‚Äôt want to be involved in that.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I would rather leave to live with my grandma, even tho she‚Äôs not the best person. She (probably?) isn‚Äôt homophobic, doesn‚Äôt care, she only cares if I go to church or if a pray.

He has 2 jobs, but the most important takes 2.5 weeks and the other one about 3 days. When I was young, there was one year he got a really good job, and stayed with us and was even home for dinner. The problem is that they closed (actually sold? Don‚Äôt remember) the company, shortened the salary and my dad was done. Since then he‚Äôs only worked abroad. I wish they didn‚Äôt close it (or sell it). He would have stayed more around.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I‚Äôve had 4 maids before. My grandma used to not treat them the best. We don‚Äôt have a maid currently.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I‚Äôve lived with my grandparents my whole life, my mother in there too and my dad also when he was off work. We lived there all the way up till my sister was born, and my grandpa passed 3 months after she was born. One of the main reasons for leaving was that everyone was fighting back then. My grandpfather hadn‚Äôt left a will and me and my sister were the only grandchildren back then. My parents just took their things and got away. They didn‚Äôt want to be involved in that.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†I would rather leave to live with my grandma, even tho she‚Äôs not the best person. She (probably?) isn‚Äôt homophobic, doesn‚Äôt care, she only cares if I go to church or if a pray. But I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. I have a little brother (4) and I won‚Äôt leave him until I know he‚Äôs fine and will live in a good house. It‚Äôs either divorce and my dad takes us all, or my mom does, but I know she cares about him. Once I hit 18 (maybe even 17) I just need a confirmation he‚Äôll be fine and I‚Äôll go.",0.0,0.012227390892803669,0,1
30,1drl5wg,AITA for standing up for myself?,"Looking for an outsider‚Äôs perspective. 

I have been at my current job for almost 2 years. When I first started, my coworker (lets call her Mary) in my department was a complete bitch. Refused to acknowledge me any time I directly addressed her, when I would help with work tasks because she was out of the office, she would be mad even though she would still get credit on those projects. I never had any intention of trying to steal her customers or overstepping. When my customers would call in she wouldn‚Äôt tell me until I called them 2-3 days later and they decided to take their business elsewhere because of my delayed response time. Anytime I would talk to my boss about these situations, I was told to stop bitching.

Fast forward we get another new girl in our department (let‚Äôs call her Lucy). Lucy saw what Mary was doing to me in the department and how I was being treated. Lucy saw Mary as she really was.

Lucy went to our boss and said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt do something about Mary, I will quit‚Äù sure enough, not too long after, Mary was fired because of her alcohol problem, that explained a lot. 

I was upset because everything I was saying kept being swept under the rug, even though it was 100% true and affecting my work. I was very confused why they listened to Lucy but ignored me.

I brushed it off and told myself not to look too deep into it. However, slowly over time, Lucy and my boss got closer as did everyone in the building with her. I‚Äôm not upset by that, that‚Äôs just for context. 

Because of that though, I constantly get interrupted when I am talking to Lucy. I get talked over in conversations. Most importantly, I am left out of important conversations, my boss had changed a rule to allow our department more opportunity to make money, but forgot to tell me about this rule. I‚Äôm not sure for how long that rule was changed, but I missed out on a bigger paycheck. 

I have been asking for a high position in my job and was told I am too good where I am now, they couldn‚Äôt justify moving me. That‚Äôs fine, I guess. But, Lucy gets handed the opportunity I have been letting my bosses know I am wanting. 

I lost it, I blew up on my boss and told her I‚Äôm putting in my two weeks. Went and talked to HR and told her everything. From when I first started to now. How I have been treated and how I don‚Äôt get taken seriously in my department. HR was determined to find me answers.

I got called into my bosses boss office (let‚Äôs call him Mr.Boss) and in short, he couldn‚Äôt give me a good explanation as to why I was not offered the opportunity. We talked about how I feel I am being treated and how I don‚Äôt understand why everyone listens to Lucy when I say the exact same thing. Again Mr.Boss tried to say it was maybe a personal issue. I agreed to some degree, I have taken lots of time to determine if the issues are my insecurities screaming, or a true problem. 

I did my best to address the true problem without anything emotion based. In the end, Mr.Boss convinced me to stay at the establishment.

31,1drl1fc,AITA for not witnessing an honor walk?,"I (24F) visited Kat (not her name) (23F) in a hospital last week. She was in recovery after getting her appendix taken out and also visiting were her sister (Ana) (25F) and her sister's boyfriend (24M). The four of us were talking about a future trip to a local resort when the door opened up. The nurse walked in and said that an honor walk was currently happening and if we wanted to see it happen we should go out and see.

Ana and her BF left the room to stand outside. Kat asked me if I was going to join them and I said no in a quiet voice. I saw my dear uncle go through an honor walk just this past winter and the event was still weighing heavily on my mind. He was very close with my family and he died in a car accident that took his life and one of his coworkers. I said that I don't want to cry and take attention away from the honor walk because the most recent one I saw is still hitting too hard.

My friend held my hand and we stayed inside as the honor walk happened. It took about ten minutes and when the donor of the honor walk happened I could feel my tears welling up. I buried my face in her blankets and when it ended my face was puffy. She dried my face just as Ana and her BF walked back inside. Her sister asked me why I wasn't there and I got shaky. I just couldn't speak but she kept pressing me for an answer and I ended the visit there. I gave Kat a hug and said I'm willing to plan things out before I had to run out of the hospital and go into my car to cry. I didn't leave my phone on silent so I got a call from Ana on Kat's number asking me why I was insensitive about visiting the honor walk. I shouted ""My uncle had an honor walk you dipshit"" and hung up.

That night I was watching some rock climbing competition with my boyfriend (25M) but I didn't quite understand it. He poked me on my shoulder and asked me what happened. I explained what happened and he said ""Dipshit seems harsh, but it's ok, sorry about your uncle."" Then he cuddled me as we watched the rest of the comp. He hasn't brought it up again but he did comfort me with his homemade poutine.

I did want to support the honor walk but I didn't think I'd be in a position to do so.  Ana has called me and said that she didn't know about my history but says that I could have worn a mask and sunglasses to conceal it. I haven't seen Ana in person since that day which throws a wrench in our plans for the resort trip.

Am I the asshole for bringing my dog to a mini splash zone at a kids public park and let him play with one of the sprinklers. 
Me(17M) and my boyfriend (17M) have taken our dog (an Australian Cattle dog mix) to this park multiple times with kids running around and he has never acted up. We usually let our dog walk around before taking him to the splash zone to cool him off and because he likes playing with water. Today when we were there, three little kids all below the age of 5 were also playing at the park, we were aware of this and took him to a side of the splash zone where they were not playing so we didn‚Äôt make them uncomfortable.
We were there for about 5-10 minutes, minding our business, no problems were occurring and our dog was perfectly calm with the kids running around, screaming and playing. All of the sudden two of their older kids (probably 4 & 5) were running up to him trying to touch him without saying anything, he didn‚Äôt react in any aggressive way at all, he would just be looking at them, but he didn‚Äôt growl or lunge or anything. Just to be safe though we pulled him close to us by the leash and kindly told the kids ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt pet him, we‚Äôre training him‚Äù to keep them away.
This happened two or three times without the parents saying anything to their kids before the dad  (mid 20s/early 30s) came up to us and started talking to us about our dog, we couldn‚Äôt make out what he was saying but we understood that he was talking about our dog so we apologized and said that we are trying our best to make their kids feel safe. 
Suddenly in a aggressive tone he said ‚Äúif your dog bites our kid we are going to have a problem‚Äù we were shocked and taken back by his tone since there was no indicators that our dog was being aggressive and that they were uncomfortable with him being around, but I tried to understand where he is coming from and apologized to him and said that our dog is not aggressive, after that he kept saying to us that we shouldn‚Äôt be there, to take him to a dog park, and that is doesn‚Äôt matter if he isn‚Äôt aggressive, dogs still bite. I tried to be nice and explain to him that we don‚Äôt have a car, this is the only park we can take him to and that he has had safe experiences with kids around him, but the dad kept cutting me off and rudely speaking to me as if I did something wrong by bringing my dog here. I have had enough at this point and said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just leave if you want us to‚Äù and started walking away, while we were trying to leave the dad was shouting to us that our dog was stupid and that we should‚Äôve taken the hint to leave. At this point he was beyond aggressive, persistently shouting at us while we were walking away until we were out of sight.

37,1drjrdd,AITA for flipping off a retail worker,"I (24M) am a recent college graduate but have chosen to still live at home. This is mainly due to my sister (21F) who is severely autistic and recently, in the past few years, developed some mobility issues. Now I don't know the exact name of her condition, because it developed while I was away at school, but I do know that she can't open containers and if she were to fall she would not be able to get up on her own. This has basically forced me to be her full time caregiver. I work remotely and am pretty introverted, so I don't mind being stuck in the house all day. My sister on the other hand likes to get out, get fresh air, so I'll usually take her out to the grocery store. Because of her condition, she can't get around most places without her walker and ankle braces so we definitely make use of the motorized shopping carts in the store. In our system, I walk around the store and she follows behind me, mimicking my movements with the cart.

During the incident in question, we stopped at our local store. We were walking around when I realized that I'd forgotten to grab something on the list. To go grab it, I quickly walked behind my sister. Now usually when I do this, I tell her ""Wait here"" or ""Don't move"" so she knows not to waste the effort to turn around in these tight aisles. At this moment, I also forgot to do that. This caused her to whip the cart around at full speed, crashing into one of those open air refrigerator cases, knocking it completely diagonal, and cracking the glass. This also happened while a stocker was refilling that exact case with cuts of meat or something. I could clearly see that the crash caused no physical impact to the employee so I wasn't worried about injuring them but the noise was so loud they were very evidently startled. Feeling like this accident was entirely my fault, I went to apologize but before I could get a word out they said, ""You know those carts are supposed to be for the elderly right? They're not for kids playing around. Kind of a dick move, asshole!""

My sister didn't register this interaction at all but it struck a nerve with me. Now I am very aware why a misunderstanding like this could happen. My sister is young and shows no outwardly signs that she'd need a mobility scooter to get around. I'm aware something like this could happen every time we enter a store. That being said, I felt no need to rationalize or explain our situation to this person we were probably never going to see again. So I flipped them off and told them to shut the hell up. We walked away and that was the end of it. There were no repercussion or other incidents after that. It's been about a month since then but it's still on my mind.

38,1drjpv9,AITA For not splitting time doing chores 50/50 with my wife? ,"Throwaway because friends know my account, blah blah blah.

My wife (53F) and I (45M) have two kids (9F and 10F). Just to set the scene, we are both full time employed with ""hybrid"" jobs that let us work from home a day or two every week. I make a bit more than her, but not a crazy high amount or anything. We both contribute pretty evenly there.

A sore spot we often argue about is time spent doing chores around the house. She would probably tell you she does 70% of even 80% of the chores. I disagree, but for the purposes of this post, let's just assume she's right and if you measure chore time around the house in hours, she does 80% and I do 20%.

The thing is, though, she is the slowest cleaner in the world. Have you ever told a little kid to clean up a room and felt like pulling your hair out as they pick one Lego up, walk across the room, put it in the box, and then go back for one more Lego? She's like one step up from that. For instance, If I see a plate, I sit it near the door. If i find a kids toy under the couch, it goes near the door. As I clean a room, I build a pile of things to go out of the room, and only when I'm done do I take everything out. She'll fine a plate, and walk all the way to the kitchen and come back. And then later find a stuffed animal and take it all the way to a kid, ask them where it goes, and then put it up. That kind of thing. If I try to encourage her to use a faster system, she gets annoyed at me for micromanaging her. 

So what I want to do is split cleaning based on rooms. When we're cleaning the house, I want her to take X rooms and I'll take Y rooms and each of us is done when our respective rooms are done (and she can pick the rooms).

The other thing is laundry. If she is ahead on chore time around the house, it's 100% because of laundry. I swear, she's always got a load in some phase of washing, drying, or being put away. And it's like 90% the kids' clothes. Honestly, I'm pretty sure they just pull stuff out of their drawers and closets and leave it on the ground without wearing it, and then she goes in and picks it up and washes it, dries it, and hangs/folds it up, only for it to be thrown on the ground again as they search for the specific shirt they want that day or whatever.

I have offered - on numerous occasions - to be in charge of the kids' laundry. Although I've told her what's going to happen there is I will make them pick it up, and while I'll help them load/unload (especially unload from the washer, they're too small for that) I'm going to make them do everything else so they learn to put stuff back away that's clean. But she really wants to do it herself, I don't know why. I only recently got her to stop doing my laundry and got full control of my own clothes (which is awesome, I can finally find all my socks now).

So I feel like I'm offering to split the work 50/50, and it's not my fault if I spend a lot less *time* doing the same work. But AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-29,"AITA For not splitting time doing chores 50/50 with my wife?  Throwaway because friends know my account, blah blah blah.

41,1drjdjb,AITA for trying to get a student back on my bus even though her parent was on the phone with her?,"Background: I‚Äôm a 33 year old female school bus driver for an elementary school. I‚Äôve had this school for 3 years. Towards the end of the year I began to notice that one of my very tiny female 4th graders was either waiting for a city bus with her brother who met her at her stop or she was walking down the very busy road that has 4 highway ramps connected to it (2 exits 2 entrees). The sidewalk she took even crosses 2 highway entrances. On this road cars like to do 40mph when it‚Äôs only 30 and pass my reds claiming ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt see me, or my red, or my arms waving for them to stop or head my horn.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs my story. One day I noticed one of my tiny 4th graders walking down a very dangerous road alone so I pulled my school bus over and asked if she wanted a ride. I had already dropped her off and at this point I figured she had moved out of the schools district. I said I didn‚Äôt mind bringing her wherever she had moved to as long as she was safe. She said her mommies friend was down the road and on the phone with her. So I said ‚Äúas long as you‚Äôre safe I‚Äôll leave.‚Äù 

Two hours later I received a phone call from this parent (yes it‚Äôs frowned upon to give our numbers to parents, it‚Äôs a risk I take). SHE TORE ME A NEW ONE. She aggressively asked how I could dare to question her parenting, how dare I question the safety of the situation she put her child in, that she birth her daughter not me, told me her child needs to learn how to be responsible and how dare I call the cops. I apologize for crossing her boundaries but stood firm that I didn‚Äôt call 911. She said ‚Äúokie dookie‚Äù and ended the call.

Well since that day I never saw that child alone again. That phone call made me feel so bad that I cried. I only want to keep my kids safe. With there being 2 entrances to a major highway kidnapping her would take SECONDS and getting far would be simple. I just think of school bus drivers being in the news for drinking and transporting kids and talking to kids in a suggestive ways but I‚Äôm being yelled at for this?

42,1drj4i0,AITA for asking my sister to respond to my text messages within 2 business days,"Me (25 F) and my sister (30 F) had a lengthy discussion in which in the end my brother in law (30 M) was yelling at me over the phone about giving unsolicited advice and how it is not warranted. 

My sister is the worst when it comes to texting back. It really bothers me as she will be active on many different social medias or will Snapchat me but will not answer text messages for over 2 weeks or in general not at all. I texted her telling her that it is rude just to ignore text messages or respond weeks later as in reality it takes about a minute to respond to a text message. I made it clear - I don‚Äôt need you responding right away, but I asked if she could at least within 2 business days respond unless she was on vacation or something like that. She flipped out on me. 

She started texted me back saying that it is not rude and that she is so busy she just has no time in her life to text back. Mind you, she works 3 days a week, 8 hours a day, and spends the rest of her days off gardening as a hobby. While I am in a full time graduate program in nurse anesthesia, moved three states away (recently) and still can manage to text someone back. I told her it was hurtful as it shows that she doesn‚Äôt care enough to give me a couple minutes of her day. She did not care and said it is not my place to judge her and critique her. 

This is coming from someone who is a psych NP and last year tried to diagnose everyone in the family, tell them what meds they should be on and what they should not be on, and say if they don‚Äôt change she will cut them out of her life bc everything they do is toxic. Mind you, this is all of my immediate family she did this too in which we had to say if everyone else is the problem and you‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs probably you? Which she did not like at first but gave up on trying to bend everyone to fit her narrative. 

She asked me if I criticize my friends, particularly a best friend, if they do something I don‚Äôt like. I said well if it‚Äôs not a good thing to do I will tell them because if you can‚Äôt talk to people about their faults to their face then you‚Äôre probably talking shit behind their back. She ignored this statement and continued to berate me. I then also stated that if someone cannot take any criticism from the people closest to them, then you‚Äôll never get better or grow as a person. And mind you, I feel like this is not that big of a deal, I am asking her to respond to a text within two business days. 

My brother in law then got on the phone yelling I shouldn‚Äôt give unsolicited advice. I mean, after the whole mental health advice bullcrap last year it was hard to listen to, I ultimately hung up and blocked her and him. Then, she kept calling me from a restricted number just to continue yelling in which I stated I am not going to listen to you patronize me for a simple request and hung up.

My steddad alan is a new thing for me and my sister we haven't been the most positive and sweet towards him but it's still all new. Yesterday I was going to a party and didn't want any dinner that day because I didn't wanna look bloated. I told my mom about it but she keept on giving me food and telling me to eat I told her no to every suggestion and we left so she could drop me off. I thought every thing was fine until today. Me and my mom was out shopping while my sister was out with her friend.

51,1drhmue,AITA for sending my male PLATONIC friend a (very NOT sexy) photo of me wearing a bikini top?,"Let's start with some background information:

Me: 36f, single, LESBIAN!
Friend: ""Carl"", 33m, in a relationship with his girlfriend of 7 years. 

Carl and I were best friends in university. About 10 years ago he confessed that he had a crush on me. That's when I came out as a lesbian and had to let him down gently. Not gonna lie, our friendship has never been quite the same since his confession but I still consider him a friend. After some time he got over his feelings, met his girlfriend (I cheered him on) and after graduation we both moved to different cities.
Today we have a very relaxed friendship based on occasional texting and a phone call every 4-6 months where we mostly talk about movies, tv shows and our pets. We haven't seen each other in person for years and I've only met his girlfriend once (we got along quiet well).
Okay, now you know the basics about my VERY platonic friendship with Carl.

Let's get to the actual situation: Today I visited my brother's family and because it was a hot day we all spend a lazy afternoon in their backyard playing with water guns and water balloons. And yes, for that I wore kneelength shorts and a bikini top. (The sporty kind that doesn't reveal much.)
At one point my SIL made a hilarious photo: Me, lounging in a hammock, while my brother and my nephew have their epic water battle in the background. Just a nice and chaotic family picture. 
And even a little bit unflattering: I'm not overweight but I'm also not skinny and because of my position and the camera angle you could clearly see my belly rolls and even a small double chin. So very much NOT a sexy photo, even if I was wearing a bikini top. Just a funny snapshot.

I loved it and sent it to three separate friends (not in a group chat), each with the same caption: ""Having a very productive day with my family. What are you doing on this sunny afternoon?"" You know, just making friendly smalltalk. One friend answered with a photo of herself and her cat, doing some gardening, the second friend just sent a laughing emoji and told me about the romance novel she was reading, and Carl ... didn't answer at all. I thought nothing about it. 

Well, that changed 30 minutes ago when Carl sent me a text that his girlfriend wasn't happy about me sending him that picture. Because of that stupid bikini top. He didn't explicitly say that he was mad at me but I could tell. No idea if they had an argument because of the picture but apparently it was the reason for some tension.
I apologized and explained, that I didn't mean anything by it. I also promised that I wouldn't send any picture like that anymore. We exchanged a couple of awkward textes and then finished the conversation. And now I'm here on Reddit asking for judgement. üòÖ

I do feel guilty that he had an argument with his girlfriend because of me, but am I really the jerk for sending him a (in my opinion) totally innocent picture?

Let's get to the actual situation: Today I visited my brother's family and because it was a hot day we all spend a lazy afternoon in their backyard playing with water guns and water balloons. And yes, for that I wore kneelength shorts and a bikini top. (The sporty kind that doesn't reveal much.)
At one point my SIL made a hilarious photo: Me, lounging in a hammock, while my brother and my nephew have their epic water battle in the background. Just a nice and chaotic family picture. 
And even a little bit unflattering: I'm not overweight but I'm also not skinny and because of my position and the camera angle you could clearly see my belly rolls and even a small double chin. So very much NOT a sexy photo, even if I was wearing a bikini top. Just a funny snapshot.

I loved it and sent it to three separate friends (not in a group chat), each with the same caption: ""Having a very productive day with my family. What are you doing on this sunny afternoon?"" You know, just making friendly smalltalk. One friend answered with a photo of herself and her cat, doing some gardening, the second friend just sent a laughing emoji and told me about the romance novel she was reading, and Carl ... didn't answer at all. I thought nothing about it. 

Well, that changed 30 minutes ago when Carl sent me a text that his girlfriend wasn't happy about me sending him that picture. Because of that stupid bikini top. He didn't explicitly say that he was mad at me but I could tell. No idea if they had an argument because of the picture but apparently it was the reason for some tension.
I apologized and explained, that I didn't mean anything by it. I also promised that I wouldn't send any picture like that anymore. We exchanged a couple of awkward textes and then finished the conversation. And now I'm here on Reddit asking for judgement. üòÖ

I do feel guilty that he had an argument with his girlfriend because of me, but am I really the jerk for sending him a (in my opinion) totally innocent picture?

I initially felt that their situation resulted from their own poor decisions and didn't feel obligated to help either of them. But time has passed, and I am becoming more uncertain in my choice day by day. Despite the doubts that have arisen since then, I still currently plan on holding my ground, but now I worry that my pride is making me an asshole. Thoughts?

Background: My parents are still legally married despite separating 7 years ago, causing financial problems for my mother. She was recently diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and can't afford tests and treatment without a loan against her retirement, which requires my father's signature.

My father, however, is a childish, horrible prick. After their separation, he harassed my mother. Despite needing his help, she doesn't want to contact him directly and wants me, as the eldest child, to act as a buffer and communicator. He's less likely to act out when talking to me, even if it's on her behalf.

At this point, it‚Äôs important to note that my mother was not innocent in their relationship, nor was she innocent as a parent. Both fought almost daily, often redirecting their anger at me, which has caused lasting trauma. One promise I‚Äôve made to myself after becoming independent was to always protect my inner-child ‚Äî something they SHOULD have done as my parents, but failed to do. I've worked incredibly hard to protect my peace, to the point of limiting contact with both of them. It has since served me well and, aside from this situation, I really love my life now. 

Anyways, since her diagnosis, my mother has pressured me to get my father's signature on the loan agreement. At first, I told her to try contacting him herself. When that failed, I reluctantly agreed to help. I thought it would be minimal and short-term, but it became more involved each week (in hindsight, this was predictable). Last weekend, I spent 5 hours relaying information between them via text, which pushed me to my breaking point. I told them both it was unfair and selfish to rely on their child for this and refused to help further.

My mom called me a horrible daughter for ""abandoning"" her and said she would ""accept what happens,"" implying she might eventually get liver failure and die as a result. I felt no empathy for her at that moment, as she had neglected her health for years despite my pleas. Her blaming me for her current condition felt preposterous, so I stood firm. However, as time has passed and my emotions have somewhat settled, I wonder if I'm truly in the right for sticking to my guns if it means my mother might eventually suffer. I work in healthcare, and so I am intimately familiar with how debilitating this disease can become. Am I \*really\* OK with that future for my mother? Will I come to regret my choices now, if and when that comes to pass? Is the right thing to do to bite the bullet and tolerate it?

See, this friend of mine has this habit of telling me about every single thing that goes wrong with her relationship and it's normal because I'm one of her closest friend and one of the few people she can talk about this stuff with because her family is hella strict.

They've gone through multiple rough patches together which they emerged from, but honestly, it likely made them trust each other less with each altercation. After listening to all the problems they have, I quietly came to the conclusion that they wouldn't last very long together if they went on like this. They make each other jealous and angry deliberately for reasons i can never understand and this is the major reason why their relationship disinterests me so much.

Things started going downhill like maybe four months ago? Apparently she got the impression that I have feelings for her boyfriend and she brought it up abruptly one day. In fact, she went as far as to show her boyfriend screenshots of the chats between me, her and these other two friends of ours from our gc about how she was teasing me for 'having feelings for her boyfriend' or smth. (P.S: I'm gay, even though I'm not out to anyone apart from my family)

She said that it's because i'm always so pessimistic about their relationship that I'm always giving off the vibe that i don't want them to be together, mind you, she got this impression because i never sugarcoat things or lie to make her feel better. They've broken up several times each time they fight i expect them to break up again. Let me also mention that i never took interest in the bf much because i was trying to avoid this exact situation where she would think i'm after him or smth.

Anyway, the situation died down after while and it came back when the two got into their biggest fight yet about some other girl i've only recently heard about, so i told her to just break up with him because they keep hurting each other. Somehow, it ended up as this whole thing where my friend told me that she didn't trust me with the details of her  relationship anymore bcs it seemed like i didn't want good things for her and her bf, She went as far as to tell our other friends that I'm a negative person and that I never wish well for any of them especially her and the bf because I never encourage her when they fight.

56,1drgui2,AITA for no longer wanting to be there for a friend struggling with anxiety?,"Hi all.
I (24M) have a friend (24M) who I am struggling to set boundaries with concerning his anxiety and retroactive jealousy (RJ) regarding his relationship with his girlfriend.
My friend and I have known each other for 10+ years now, and I do consider him to be my best friend. However, a few years ago I moved out of state after getting married, and I think that it has changed the friendship dynamic in a strange way.
He is a very strong personality, and is used to getting his way with friends, parents, girlfriends, what have you, but ever since I moved out of state, it seems like he ""looks up"" to me now, like he sees me as being somehow wiser now and seeks advice on many subjects.
I'm not opposed to that and I'm usually happy to help. 
However, recently he started going through a period of dealing with RJ concerning things that his girlfriend has said to him, about her past relationships and such. I do not really want to get into the details of that, but rest assured I know way more about his girlfriend than I had ever planned to...
Anyhow, at the beginning of this current period of dealing with the RJ, he came to me with his concerns and I ended up telling him that RJ is what he is suffering from. This has been going on for close to a month now, I should mention. Anyways, he took that information and went the exact opposite way that I intended him to go with it...
Instead of helping him feel validated it led to him desperately researching RJ and coming up with all sorts of new scenarios to worry about.
So I told him to check into therapy and led him to look into one of the online therapy platforms because there was absolutely nothing that I could do to help with his irrational fears.
He tried the therapy, but it does not seem to have helped, because in the weeks since then (about 2) he has been constantly texting me, calling me, and all-around ambushing me any way he can in order to talk about his anxiety.
One day last weekend he called me 5 times because I was trying to ignore him, one time being while I was taking a nap (thankfully I had my phone on dnd).
If I text him back to say that I'm busy, he takes it as an immediate invitation to call me before I can get away again.
It's gotten so bad that I've tried coming up with lies, like saying that I'm working extra on weekdays or that my wife and I are on a ""big trip"" on the weekends (no dice - he called me immediately after telling him about the ""trip"").
I have tried discussing this with my therapist, and she's given me homework on setting up clear boundaries, but I've tried absolutely everything and the friend does not even notice my boundaries much less respect them.
It's a few more weeks until my next therapy appointment and he's started trying to call me already today.

I also suggested she take some part time food service / fast food jobs and actually said that they are not hiring enough which I find very hard to believe, literal teenagers get these jobs.

Anyway, now she says she has a foreign company wanting to offer her a contract to do some work which she says she can do but needs a better graphics card (She has an AMD RX 580 which is a perfectly fine card) and she wants a 4070 ti Super. I told her to make the company pay for it but she says they do not want to and did not try insisting any further. They do not want to pay her until she completes the job.

While I do have the funds, I am a little upset about her not trying hard enough regarding my other advice and as an avid gamer I know that the card she uses is decent enough for most games even if not on the highest settings or resolution.

Always these jerks who are shooting at me are doing quite badly in school and I am doing relatively well, especially in math (in fact I am considered the best in the class in that field). I know for a fact that these people will come to me for homework at the end of the summer and want help for the rest of the year. 



So WIBTA if I retaliate on them by purposely giving them the bad homework and explaining the wrong things to make them do even worse in school?



Keep in mind that this is considered in my country to be a FUNDAMENTAL school year, however, I am really tired of these comments and deep down wish to see them fail a bit.

62,1drfx3q,AITA for not inviting my fiance‚Äôs brother to our wedding?,"My fiance (24 male) and i( 24 female) got engaged this april after 5 years of dating. His family is not all enthused for our engagement right now but we are pushing through.

My fiance has 2 brothers( 1 step brother, G(26),who is lovely and treats me with reaspect and his blood related brother,K(27),who is a complete asshole to me and has no human decency).

Me and G get along great however for 5 years i have gotten rude comments, and upmost disrespect from K and this time he took it too far.

In the past he has refused to talk to me directly and in turn talked to my then boyfriend to give me instructions, has told me ""hmm i bet you have a whole lot of elevator music going on in your head"" insinuating that im stupid and many other similar comments.

Keep in mind that he also publicly talks down about his family members and has said he wanted to set a church on fire and no one does/says anything about his behavior.

A few weeks ago My fiance and i went to church and came back home, i told him I was going to try on a wedding dress that i was getting second hand in about 30 minutes, so I sat on the couch and continued to wedding plan, (i stayed on the couch the entire time the argument took place).

My fiance asked K to come over and help move some heavier things in the house.

K said hello to me, i said hello back and continued to do what i needed to do before leaving to try on my wedding dress.

K came over to me and asked if i was going to help and i said ""no, i have other things i need to do"".

K got aggressive and started to storm around the room talking about how i am lazy,and that me wedding planning wasnt important and that my wedding was going to suck brcause im ""broke"", he brought my finances into conversation and said that he was going to leave. I told him to get the hell out and he called me a bitch and a ""f-ing cunt"" and stormed out of the house.

My fiance was in a different room so he only caught the end of the argument. He made his brother aware that he will not talk to me like that at all and that he was awfully rude and k didnt like that. K sent my fiance long elaborate messages over the next 8 hours about how he thinks i want to fight him and how im an asshole, and that i will always be my fiance's girlfriend to him..etc. K also told my fiance and his parents about this situation.

K is not sorry about his actions and i dont want him at the wedding. I talked to my fiance's and k's parents and they say that he is family and that he should come. I said that i have been disrespected and treated like crap that i deserve to not have to worry about my k on my wedding day. I am a person who doesnt enjoy open conversation, im quiet but am noce and respectful and i deserve to be the center of attention along with my fiance on my wedding instead of making everyone happy.

I wanted to do something special for her birthday, so I immediately started thinking about gift ideas. I knew she was a fan of plushies and Pok√©mon, so I decided on six Pok√©mon plushies to make up her dream team, since I knew what it was made up of. Since she loves the sitting cuties pokemon plushie line, which are only available in the UK, I arranged for a friend there to receive and forward them. It was a bit expensive, so I planned to give her three for her birthday and three for Christmas.

Two weeks ago, four friends invited me to a group chat about getting her a group gift. They were all close to her and mentioned plushies, so I shared my idea. Everyone liked it, and we agreed to split the cost, making it more sensible to give all 6 plushies together for her birthday. I ordered the plushies and included a few extras for my UK friend as a thank-you.

Problems began when someone suggested adding two more people to the group gift. I wasn't keen since they were not involved in the gift decision, and had only wanted to get a gift because they were invited to the party. I felt it would reduce the number of gifts she received, not to mention the fact that I didn't like the idea on a personal level.

Things worsened when they added another person without even consulting me, who then even criticized the gift, saying something along the lines of ""damn, all of that money for 6 little plushies?"". I expressed my concerns again, but I was ignored. Then again, they decided to add yet another person. 

Frustrated, I offered two options: either we choose a second gift for the newcomers to give together or I handle my gift alone. For the former option, I even offered to triple the amount of money I was putting into the gifts so that nobody had to spend any extra for the second gift.

They leaned towards the first option but continued to downplay my concerns and invalidate how I felt about the whole situation, so in the end I decided to proceed with my original plan of giving the gift alone, since I was frustrated with how things were handled and didn't want to be a part of it any longer.

66,1dre3tr,AITA for asking for my roommate to play music during her ‚Äúfun‚Äù time?,"Hi! So I live with my roommate, who frequently has her partner over. The issue is, they engage in some freaky stuff and are extremely loud about it.

I have asked them to keep it down or turn on some music or something but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work? It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre competing with the music to see if they can be louder than the music.

I wouldn‚Äôt actually care too much because I could just pop in headphones but I have a 13 month old living in the apartment as well who, while she doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, she can‚Äôt put in headphones and we try to keep screen time to a minimum. I usually turn on music for her but I‚Äôm worried about the volume I have to play it at to drown them out.

After having a long discussion about it, my roommate basically said it was weird for me to keep asking for music and her partners roommates (who are all the partner‚Äôs fuck buddies) say it‚Äôs weird as well.  She said she dealt with it when I was having some fun with my partner in my room, before she started seeing her current partner.

Hi! So I live with my roommate, who frequently has her partner over. The issue is, they engage in some freaky stuff and are extremely loud about it.

I have asked them to keep it down or turn on some music or something but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work? It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre competing with the music to see if they can be louder than the music.

I wouldn‚Äôt actually care too much because I could just pop in headphones but I have a 13 month old living in the apartment as well who, while she doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, she can‚Äôt put in headphones and we try to keep screen time to a minimum. I usually turn on music for her but I‚Äôm worried about the volume I have to play it at to drown them out.

After having a long discussion about it, my roommate basically said it was weird for me to keep asking for music and her partners roommates (who are all the partner‚Äôs fuck buddies) say it‚Äôs weird as well.  She said she dealt with it when I was having some fun with my partner in my room, before she started seeing her current partner. At that time, I didn‚Äôt fully understand just how thin the walls are until they began engaging in their impact play.

I invited my dad, mom, brother, his girlfriend, my husband, and our kid. The reservation was for 11:30 am, but my dad, mom, brother, and his girlfriend arrived at 12:30 pm due to a rental car issue. My husband, our kid, and I arrived on time and started eating after confirming they would be late. I paid for everyone upon entering the buffet. We all ate together until 1:30 pm.

However, my husband and I had to leave for an Apple demo appointment at 2pm that we had booked when we reached.

When I suggested they could leave with us since our dining time was up, my brother responded with, ""Why should I stop eating because of you?"" They all told us to go ahead, which left me feeling a bit frustrated because I thought we could leave together.

Feeling annoyed, I said to my brother, ""Why are you so entitled?"" He got angry, and before leaving, I sarcastically remarked, ""Okay, now you can continue to eat all you want, eat till you're full and enjoy your food.""

My mom has been in a relationship with my stepdad for 12 years and they have 2 kids that are both younger than me( 12 and 3). My dad got into a long distance relationship about 9 months ago. His GF is nice but has only spoken to me once and that was just to say hello.
My dad asked me if i wanted his GF to join us on our vacation to Greece. We‚Äôll be visiting my grandparents who live there. I told him that i wasn‚Äôt sure but the longer I think about it the less I want her there. 
My grandmas house is a safe space for me but it‚Äôs already full when we visit and I already feel like I have no privacy there at all. The door to my bedroom is broken so it has to stay open and the lounge area is basically visible from anywhere in the house. There‚Äôs almost always somebody home. To add on to that my dad‚Äôs gf also has a daughter (5) who would have to go with us. I have never met or spoken to her and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs not a bad child but I don‚Äôt have good experiences with kids that age. My brother and Cousin have both broken my things multiple times when they were 5 but I ended up being the one getting scolded bc they were just children.
But the worst thing is that I can‚Äôt even tell my dad any of this bc he‚Äôs convinced himself that I‚Äôm jealous of the attention they would get. Every time I try to talk to him about them I start crying bc I‚Äôm so frustrated and he uses this as confirmation of his ideas.
I think I WBTA since they‚Äôve done nothing wrong and I shouldn‚Äôt stop them from meeting family just because I enjoy being alone and having as much privacy as possible. There‚Äôs also the issue of me having to be the translator for my dad‚Äôs gf since I‚Äôm the only one who knows English in my family. 
My dad and her have been talking using a translator. My dad drives to meet her about twice a month, but I‚Äôm usually at school when that happens. She‚Äôs come to visit my dad twice.

Edit for more info: 
We live in Germany and his gf lives in the Czech Republic. My maternal side of the family will not be coming with us, they‚Äôre going to visit family in Poland.

The trip to Greece is a 22h drive by car but my dad said he could get plane tickets for his gf and her child. But he probably won‚Äôt bc he‚Äôs frugal. 

The trip is annual but usually only my dad, uncle and me go, there have been a few times that other people drove with us but that was usually one person who was a close family friend who got dropped off halfway.
I‚Äôve talked to him about my discomfort about bringing her along. He tried to comfort me by saying that I‚Äôll spend the vacation the way i always do and that I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. 

I think he still thinks I‚Äôm jealous of her.
He once again completely missed my points about the house being crowded, me not knowing them, the 22h drive with them and just generally being uncomfortable with the lack of privacy. 

His response was that they (him, his gf and her child) could just stay with my great grandmother instead and that we‚Äôll (grandparents, uncle, them and me) only meet up for lunch if that‚Äôs what I want. 
That wasn‚Äôt what i wanted, but he didn‚Äôt listen  (this vacation is usually the only time i get to spend with him since he always works)

My Dad has cursed at workers, threatened them both verbally and physically, and I feel terrible because the people working these jobs are usually overworked and underpaid for dealing with people like this. Besides trying to calm him down, I never exactly knew how to deal with these types of situations.

Recently, we had an internet outage at our home and ended up calling the internet service line. The woman who was helping us was very kind, but my parents were very annoyed due to the outage.

They were not letting her get a word in, and I had no idea how they would expect the service to get fixed by not letting the agent speak. They eventually said it was her fault that they could not get service, and dropped the phone down. 

After this, the woman was still on the line and asked if we had any other questions. I picked the phone up and apologized for my parents' behavior, saying that what they did was extremely rude. I assumed that this was the right thing to do, as she seemed to really appreciate the apology. I was very scared to do this, so I had tried to walk away while responding to her. However, my Dad still overheard, and my parents began yelling at me for not sticking up for them. They insisted that I was the one who made the mistake, and my Dad called me a ""stupid bitch"" for not siding with him and my Mom. Apparently, I'm always supposed to stand beside my family, no matter if I think that their behavior is wrong.

I definitely understand that, and I truly appreciate that they took me to the emergency room and are encouraging my recovery. However, I still don't feel that is justification for taking it out on a customer service worker, or anyone else for that matter.

I have always done my best to make my parents happy, and I don't understand why they would be upset with me in this incident.

I can only bare them for a couple of hours a day at the moment as I am still getting used to them.

I am currently on a getaway with my girlfriend and her family in a caravan park. Last night after we had been out for a couple of hours my feet started to really hurt, so my gf told me to remove the insoles from my shoes and she will give them to her mum to keep safe in the pram, so I did this thinking that this would be okay. 

This morning I asked my girlfriend is she could get them out of the pram for me and they wasn‚Äôt there, we looked all over the apartment and they wasn‚Äôt there either. So it‚Äôs looking like they‚Äôve been lost. Naturally I am pretty annoyed about this because you only get one free pair on the NHS and now I will have to pay for another and they are quite expensive.  Instead of understanding why I‚Äôm annoyed my girlfriend just said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you to put them in the pram‚Äù basically implying it‚Äôs my fault they got lost because I let her put them in the pram. I then reminded her that actually she put them in the pram which I allowed her to do because I trusted they would be safe there since she said they would, she then responded to this saying ‚Äúyes but you still made the choice to let me put them in the pram, you didn‚Äôt have to take my advice‚Äù. Her family also said that I must not have cared about them that much since I didn‚Äôt check to see if they were still there until the morning.

At this put I felt really confused and distorted and I lost my cool and blew up at my girlfriend, which i later regretted. I felt manipulated and felt like she was trying to not take accountability and instead deflect blame onto me. In the She said that she would pay for them even though she shouldn‚Äôt have to because she didn‚Äôt lose them to which I responded agreeing, saying that her mum should pay for them, but that won‚Äôt happen as my girlfriend is too scared to say anything to her mum.

I can only bare them for a couple of hours a day at the moment as I am still getting used to them.

I am currently on a getaway with my girlfriend and her family in a caravan park. Last night after we had been out for a couple of hours my feet started to really hurt, so my gf told me to remove the insoles from my shoes and she will give them to her mum to keep safe in the pram, so I did this thinking that this would be okay. 

This morning I asked my girlfriend is she could get them out of the pram for me and they wasn‚Äôt there, we looked all over the apartment and they wasn‚Äôt there either. So it‚Äôs looking like they‚Äôve been lost. Naturally I am pretty annoyed about this because you only get one free pair on the NHS and now I will have to pay for another and they are quite expensive.  Instead of understanding why I‚Äôm annoyed my girlfriend just said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you to put them in the pram‚Äù basically implying it‚Äôs my fault they got lost because I let her put them in the pram. I then reminded her that actually she put them in the pram which I allowed her to do because I trusted they would be safe there since she said they would, she then responded to this saying ‚Äúyes but you still made the choice to let me put them in the pram, you didn‚Äôt have to take my advice‚Äù. Her family also said that I must not have cared about them that much since I didn‚Äôt check to see if they were still there until the morning.

At this put I felt really confused and distorted and I lost my cool and blew up at my girlfriend, which i later regretted. I felt manipulated and felt like she was trying to not take accountability and instead deflect blame onto me. In the She said that she would pay for them even though she shouldn‚Äôt have to because she didn‚Äôt lose them to which I responded agreeing, saying that her mum should pay for them, but that won‚Äôt happen as my girlfriend is too scared to say anything to her mum.

79,1dra6z2,AITA for having a conversation with my dad about his jokes / comments.,"I (24M) live at home with my family. My Dad (54M) is currently under an enormous amount of stress at work and is coming up to his retirement within the next few years. 

I am deeply worried about him. Along side his work he doesn‚Äôt have much time for fun and goes to see his father (my grandfather) as he (grandfather) has worsening dementia.

My father has barely, if even any time for himself. He gives his whole week to his work and most of the weekend to my grandfather. He has stated this himself. I have even found him working until early hours of the morning (midnight to even 1am and even doing all nighters). 

However lately, he has been making what he would state himself were ‚Äújokes‚Äù, as well as comments that I find deeply concerning. 

For example, he drinks a fair bit. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an alcoholic, but I raised it with him and he said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only fun thing I get to do on any given day‚Äù. I can‚Äôt help but feel concern about this. I also hate to state further but it is comments like that that do lead to someone developing the tendencies of an alcoholic. 

Furthermore, I saw him watching TV the other day and he said ‚Äúwhy is that person wearing ropes on her head‚Äù referring to their dreadlocks. Similarly when we were watching the Euros football match recently, we were talking about one of our fastest players on our team, Bukayo Saka (a black player for the England Team). My dad then comments ‚Äúit‚Äôs because he‚Äôs an immigrant‚Äù In an attempt to get a laugh. 

Comments like these have become more and more frequent and I have never seen him make comments like this. I even spoke to a friend of mine who is half Indian and my dad apprently said to him ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look like the rest of them‚Äù. I brought this up with my dad and he furiously denies that this happened. 

Last night I decided to bring this all up to him as this had been deeply worrying and concerning me for the last few months. I admit, bringing it up late at night (11pm) was not a clever idea. However he has said that I am overly sensitive and that he should be allowed to make these jokes away from the public in the comfort of his own home. 

He got really angry at said directly to me ‚Äúyou think I am an alcoholic and a racist‚Äù. I pleaded that I genuinely don‚Äôt believe this is true but it‚Äôs why I am concerned in the first place as I have never seen him do or act or say this type of thing until recently. He also said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre that worried about me, what‚Äôre you doing about it‚Äù. While he‚Äôs right and I admit that I‚Äôm not doing much to help, I wouldn‚Äôt know the first place to start. I have been with him multiple times to see my grandfather with him and spend time with them together. But I can‚Äôt afford to drag him away for a Spa day or something like that.

81,1dr9owl,AITA for asking my sister to please stop bringing up her stepgrandkids names to me?,"The title might be a little confusing so let me begin.

My sister Mary is married to Derek and she is the stepmother to his four children from his late wife. They are all in their mid 20s to early 30s now. All of them are married with children. Derek's first wife passed away while the children were still very young (7 and under) and Mary and Derek met 18 months later and married 10 months after that. Mary always adored her stepkids and she strived for them to have a close relationship and it does appear to be pretty alright. They treat her respectfully and they don't try to exclude her from any big moments in their lives. But I also acknowledge that they do keep an emotional distance from her and seem almost afraid to get too close. Like they'll dishonor their mom if they get close to Mary.

Something this has really shown in is their children. There are 11 grandchildren between the four kids and each and every one has some part of their name honoring their mom or their dad. Mostly it's the middle names where these honors happen but two of them have first names honoring their late mother. The other sides of the children's families are not represented in the names from what Mary and Derek were told.

So it hurt Mary that of all the grandkids, they made the effort with each one to honor one of their bio parents in some way but not her. I think it especially hurt her for the younger two kids to do this because she raised them from very young ages. She has confessed it mostly bothers her because her husband also gets honored and they go out of their way to do it in different ways with each grandchild. She has been talking to me about it a lot lately. I didn't mind her coming to me for a shoulder to cry on at first. But for six months now I have listened to her bring this up dozens of times. She doesn't want to complain to her husband or her stepkids so I'm the safe space to do so. I just don't want to keep hearing about this indefinitely. 

So I gently asked Mary to please stop talking about this as often. I suggested a therapist if she really needs someone to speak to openly about this on a frequent basis but I told her it's starting to weigh on our relationship because we talk about her stepgrandkids names more than anything else. Mary was upset and told me she'd stop. But she wasn't happy about it and she has been different with me ever since. She even snapped at me the other day and I suspect this is coming from what I said.

84,1dr8udx,AITA For Stopping A High Teen From Entering A Gym?,"Long story, sorry. 


I'm the strength and conditioning coach at a local high school. It's a volunteer position, but my wife and I love helping the community. (She trains many of the female athletes)


During the summer, the local high school opens the school weight room in the morning for students who want to train for the upcoming year. I was asked by the coaches to help with the training because I'm not a complete idiot when it comes to picking up stuff. 


Here's how it works, when a student comes in for summer lifting, their paperwork is checked by a teacher then I do intake.

After they see a teacher, they come to me and I set them on a program after some simple questions. (injuries, sports position, blah blah blah, it doesn't really matter)


Anyways, four days ago, a kid walked in and looked stoned out of his mind. He saw the teacher then came over to me. His eyes were tiny slits and he absolutely reeked of grass. He's 14 years, apparently.  I asked him a few questions and only got giggles and ""yeah"" as the responses. After about 30 seconds I can tell this kid is going to get hurt if he lifts, so I tell him he can't lift today and to come back tomorrow. He says, ""okay"" then leaves like nothing happened. 


An hour later, the school gets an angry call from the mother asking why her son isn't allowed in the weight room. A secretary came to the weight room asked for details. The teacher in charge took my side even though he should have stopped the kid from even getting past him, whatever. 


The secretary went back, called the mom and said that a volunteer (me) stopped the kid because he was high. The mom absolutely lost her mind. She immediately called bigger people than I've ever met and demanded I get removed and that I shouldn't be there at all. 


The football head coach told me this morning that the kid's excuse was that his father was smoking weed while driving to the high school and the kid didn't do it, but that's why he smelled so bad. He also said I can't be on site again until this all blows over, but I can still do the programming through texts and emails. I'm at the point where I just want to walk away from all of it and say good luck to the teams.

I'm the strength and conditioning coach at a local high school. It's a volunteer position, but my wife and I love helping the community. (She trains many of the female athletes)


During the summer, the local high school opens the school weight room in the morning for students who want to train for the upcoming year. I was asked by the coaches to help with the training because I'm not a complete idiot when it comes to picking up stuff. 


Here's how it works, when a student comes in for summer lifting, their paperwork is checked by a teacher then I do intake.

85,1dr8f2u,AITA for telling my sister that just because she's a social worker it doesn't mean she always knows what's best for foster kids?,"My sister (30s) is a social worker. My husband and I (30s) are foster parents. We are currently long term foster parents (and possibly foster to adopt) for biological siblings. The siblings lost their sole parent a couple of years ago. They have half siblings from said parent who are much older, now adults to be exact. Our foster kids miss their half siblings and have craved a relationship with them. But the half siblings have chosen not to have contact and from the limited info we know about our foster kids lives before they came to live with us, any visits that were had while the half siblings were minors, it had to be forced on the older kids who did not wish to keep contact.

This has been extremely difficult for our foster children and we have advocated for them to be in therapy, which luckily was approved and they go once a week. But they often ask about and bring up their half siblings and beg for us to set up time for them to see them.

My sister is aware of this and has spoken out to my husband and myself three different times about how we need to do more to ensure this relationship between siblings. We have told her that's not possible. She told us we are failing our foster kids. She said we need to find out the info of these half siblings and fight for contact. She told us we could bring it to court if we need to. I reminded her that's not something we can do. She told me the kids will never see us as parents or want to be in our family if we keep them from their siblings. And then she went on and about how important sibling relationships are and brought up the fact she's a social worker and ""she knows how these things work better than anyone in the family"".

I told her that just because she's a social worker it doesn't mean she always knows what's best for foster kids. I told her she also has no control over adult decisions that are made. Which is something she should know as a social worker. She told me I should take her professional advice and stop invalidating her profession and experience like I did just there.

my cousin, 19y/o female, izzy brought up an idea to go on an all cousins trip to six flag a year ago. it would be highschoolers and up without our parents. all of the parents and my cousins were asking me when we where going to go and detail i couldnt give them yet. 2 months before i asked my brother, 23y/o male, chris, oldest sister, 22y/o female addison, and middle sister 19y/o female kate if they wanted to go to six flags with us cousins only. they all liked the idea of going. i finally choose a date i thought would fit in everyone's calendar. everyone agreed that it was okay. 

an important note, these 3 siblings have long term relationships and they all live with their partners. also my brother is the oldest gandkid on both sides of the family and the youngest going with us is 14?

when i asked chris if he was okay with the date, he agreed and brought up the driving situation. he would take two people, addison would take two people and me. kate would take one of our cousins who live near her as she lives in a farther town than us but closer to our destination. he also asked if my sisters boyfriends were going with. i didnt know the exact answer but said yes. when i relay the messege to others, they all agreed that it was okay. and as i assumed their boyfriends were already invited. a groupchat was made with the party involved going. everyone got the idea and understanding on what was happening. then my sister kate tells us her friends might be going. i read the message and was really confused. why would her friends be going if this is meant to be a cousins family thing? i texted back that this is meant to be a cousins thing. bringing your gf/bf was alrady a strech. if you want to bring your friends, go another time. my cousin izzy also responded with the same thing agreeing with me.

in a separate group chat i had with my sisters, kate texted me calling me a bitch. she quoted the part where i said ""gf/bfs is already a stretch"" and said that i was rude and didnt say anything about not inviting our partners or friends. (i thought it was logical put out there that this was FAMILY ONLY) addison replys shortly after agreeing with kate about how i was rude and the more the merrier. plus everyone is just going to break off and do their own thing so it didn't matter. kate said exactly, im just a bitter bitch because i dont have a boyfriend and its not her problem we didnt invite our friends. 

i responded to her that she needs to go to bed because she was acting crazy and she needs to be considerate of others who don't have the choice of bringing their significant other or friends just because they can't drive that long distance to six flags. if the rest of us wanted to bring our gf/bf and our friends and then break off into our own groups, there no point of even going with family. kate then told me she didnt even like that side of the family and yada yada yada.

at this point im irritated with kate. she told me she was fed up with me and im not grown so i need to stop saying and acting like i am when im not. i told kate im sorry that she dosent have a good relationship with our cousins like i do but its fucking sad going to family functions and everyone ask me where you guys are. why is it so hard to hangout with your family for one day. also i dont have the luxury of moving out yet so its incomparable but still as i am in high school im acting more mature about this than you.

nasty words went back and fourth and i told kate im ending the conversation. she told the big group chat her and her bf wouldnt be going. she removed herself from our sisters group chat. im scared my sister will block me on everything and wont talk to me anymore.

my cousin, 19y/o female, izzy brought up an idea to go on an all cousins trip to six flag a year ago. it would be highschoolers and up without our parents. all of the parents and my cousins were asking me when we where going to go and detail i couldnt give them yet. 2 months before i asked my brother, 23y/o male, chris, oldest sister, 22y/o female addison, and middle sister 19y/o female kate if they wanted to go to six flags with us cousins only. they all liked the idea of going. i finally choose a date i thought would fit in everyone's calendar. everyone agreed that it was okay. 

an important note, these 3 siblings have long term relationships and they all live with their partners. also my brother is the oldest gandkid on both sides of the family and the youngest going with us is 14?

when i asked chris if he was okay with the date, he agreed and brought up the driving situation. he would take two people, addison would take two people and me. kate would take one of our cousins who live near her as she lives in a farther town than us but closer to our destination. he also asked if my sisters boyfriends were going with. i didnt know the exact answer but said yes. when i relay the messege to others, they all agreed that it was okay. and as i assumed their boyfriends were already invited. a groupchat was made with the party involved going. everyone got the idea and understanding on what was happening. then my sister kate tells us her friends might be going. i read the message and was really confused. why would her friends be going if this is meant to be a cousins family thing? i texted back that this is meant to be a cousins thing. bringing your gf/bf was alrady a strech. if you want to bring your friends, go another time. my cousin izzy also responded with the same thing agreeing with me.

in a separate group chat i had with my sisters, kate texted me calling me a bitch. she quoted the part where i said ""gf/bfs is already a stretch"" and said that i was rude and didnt say anything about not inviting our partners or friends. (i thought it was logical put out there that this was FAMILY ONLY) addison replys shortly after agreeing with kate about how i was rude and the more the merrier. plus everyone is just going to break off and do their own thing so it didn't matter. kate said exactly, im just a bitter bitch because i dont have a boyfriend and its not her problem we didnt invite our friends. 

i responded to her that she needs to go to bed because she was acting crazy and she needs to be considerate of others who don't have the choice of bringing their significant other or friends just because they can't drive that long distance to six flags. if the rest of us wanted to bring our gf/bf and our friends and then break off into our own groups, there no point of even going with family. kate then told me she didnt even like that side of the family and yada yada yada.

at this point im irritated with kate. she told me she was fed up with me and im not grown so i need to stop saying and acting like i am when im not. i told kate im sorry that she dosent have a good relationship with our cousins like i do but its fucking sad going to family functions and everyone ask me where you guys are. why is it so hard to hangout with your family for one day. also i dont have the luxury of moving out yet so its incomparable but still as i am in high school im acting more mature about this than you.

nasty words went back and fourth and i told kate im ending the conversation. she told the big group chat her and her bf wouldnt be going. she removed herself from our sisters group chat. im scared my sister will block me on everything and wont talk to me anymore.

when we were younger, she put the same amount of effort into wishing me a happily birthday. it wasn't much, but just a simple card, gift, or just attending my birthday party made me feel appreciated. 

but now that we are older, especially this year in particular, she's seemed to care less about me. this year for her birthday (which is before mine in the year) i had gotten her a hoodie, a tank top, and a gift card to starbucks, and i gave it all to her at school. after i said happy birthday many times and handed her the gift, she just said thanks, and shoved it in her locker. i have never seen her wear any of the clothes i had given her, even though she asked for them. 

this brings me to my birthday, which was a few days ago. now because we are older, most people just sent a text, or posted on their snapchat story saying happy birthday with a bunch of pictures of me. but of course, she didn't even bother even though we were ""closer"" friends than most of the people wishing me happy birthday. obviously i'm not saying she needs to buy me a gift, but i feel like she could at least wish me happy birthday right? i mean we've known each other since 5th grade and we eat lunch together every day!!?

when i got to school, she did not say anything at all. she just walked up to me and started started walking me to her class, still not saying anything. then one of my other friends came up to me saying ""happy birthday!!"" and i thanked her, and then looked back at tanya who had a weird judgmental look on her face.

i asked her why she was looking at me like that, and she raised her voice saying ""i'm not even looking at you calm down."" LIKE EXUSE ME??!? WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN??!?

i looked at her and i suddenly lost it "" tanya do you even actually care about me? like how long have we been friends and you don't even care enough to wish me happy birthday! i put so much into being your friend and you don't even try."" i told her that i needed a little space from her and time to think about our friendship and i left her standing there while i walked to my own class. 

some of my other friends kept messaging me saying that i was too harsh on her, that i was overreacting, and that she has a lot on her mind and it was an honest mistake to forget. it kinda makes me feel really bad, like maybe i did overreact. plus we have been friends for so long and have so many good memories.

She described the TV a little, that it was like a brand new one because it rarely got used (10 year old smart TV, was 2k when they bought it) and she‚Äôd like 400‚Ç¨ for it. 
So I asked my dad for a small loan and told her I‚Äôd buy it.

100,1dr607h,AITA am I the toxic friend?,"AITA for letting my friendship die?

So I have been friends with this girl on and off since I was in year 7 (13yo) and now we‚Äôre 26 & 27 years old. 

In high school she would only ever hang out with me if she didn‚Äôt have a better offer, when she got ‚Äòcool‚Äô and I didn‚Äôt she would stop talking to me. We would always be friendly but never hang out when this happened. We both moved to another school in the last few years of high school and when that happened she refused to talk to me. I wasn‚Äôt invited to her 18th and I was essentially nothing to her. 

Fast forward to University, we both moved down to the city. I was studying and she was just working. She wanted to I guess ‚ÄòCatch up‚Äô because she didn‚Äôt have many friends in the city and was lonely, I said yes and we hung out, got drunk and went clubbing, this then started her wanting to hang out with me more and more but only clubbing and drinking

Eventually I moved back to our home town and she stayed in the city, I visited her a few times but she was into drugs and partying and I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with all of that. 
I found my now husband and we started dating, she constantly told me he was full of red flags, he was bad for me and I needed to let him go. She never made an effort with him, always said I could do better.

We drifted apart again she moved back and wanted to be friends again when she found out she was pregnant. I did all I could for her, then I found out me and my fianc√© were expecting, throughout my pregnancy I was super sick and she didn‚Äôt offer to help me but always asked if I could babysit her baby, I did so and was there for her when I could be. 

Due to my husbands job we had to move 6 hours away, she was devistated that I was ‚Äòleaving her‚Äô and wasn‚Äôt happy about the move. She kept saying my husband was selfish for moving us away with a 3 month old baby.

During the 12 months we  never really spoke to me we just drifted apart again. 

We moved back and we didn‚Äôt catch up really.

I got married last year and she was my maid of honour. She was pregnant, that was no issue to me I was fine with that but the wedding became a lot about her and what she liked and didn‚Äôt like eventually she pulled out of the wedding but still came as a guest and this seemed to make her angry that she wasn‚Äôt involved more? She left the wedding early. 

I invited her to my daughter‚Äôs birthday and she said she couldn‚Äôt come, I invited her to hang out but she was always busy so I stopped. She recently had a second child and moved back to the home town and wants to start hanging out again, I work 45 hours a week and only have one day a week to spend with my family so every time she messaged me wanting to go for a coffee I never could. A member of her family passed away and with how busy I am it slipped my mind to send her a message of condolence so she‚Äôs deleted me off socials and now no longer talks to me. I know what was a horrible thing to do on my part but it‚Äôs got me thinking, all this time AITA?

101,1dr5j8m,AITA for moving out?,"I (31M) and my (30F) wife decided to move out and rent a flat.
Background. My parents started building a house in a nearby city more than 10 years ago. Progression was slow and stopped work altogether due to financial issues. The house is huge. It looks like two apartments stacked together. This will be important.
The story
Me and my Wife are staying at my parents house and everything was fine. At first it was me and my wife, my brother and my parents. Due to space issues, me and my brother shared a big room divided by big wooden doors that have really tall glass panels, so intimacy was a problem but we figured something out. My parents moved down, and my brother moved in my parents bedroom, and I was left with both rooms (but even so, there are too many windows and glass doors). After years of trying, me and my wife had a child and things were quite smooth. In july '23 my brother got a new gf and when, we liked her a lot. But, at some point my brother and gf started coming more often and she started spending her nights here, to the point that she comes on thursday and leaves on monday. My wife complained that the gf is coming quite often and my mother agreed (my wife is doing all the house keeping on the floor we live but gf and brother nothing). My mother agreed and said that she will talk to the both of them (I was away, I am a sailor). After my mother talked, nothing changed. My wife was upset and my mother asked her ""whats wrong?"" and my wife burst out crying and left with our kid to my aunt. There was a shitshow and some words were thrown left and right and my mother explicitly told my wife to not tell me a word. My wife told me when I came back  and I was quite angry, but kept my mouth shut. A few weeks ago I wanted to have a heart to heart with my brother. When I went to talk to him, after 30 seconds, my mother and father came up and said ""lets talk"". I was shocked. I let them chew into me, but not even once did they mention my kid. I told my wife ""We have to move"". We asked everybody we knew the how and what to do. And we decided to move out on a rent. We managed to strike a deal. Yesterday I explained to my mother that we are moving out and renouncing the house that we are building in the neighbouring town, because finishing it means that I will sacrifice all my youth and I prefer to spend time with my child while I'm home. But in truth I do this because I don't want to argue with anyone, I want to keep relations on good terms and I want to have my place with my rules. And since then she acts very cold. Last year when I asked them to sell the house she said ""After all the fights I had with your dad I will not sell that house"" but my dad doesn't mind selling.
I acted in secret. I knew that she would try to turn me back and keep the status quo. And everybody who we talked to supports us and agrees that the new house is too big.

105,1dr3qd2,AITA for telling my boyfriend he should cut back on alcohol?,"
Please feel free to tell me if I‚Äôm completely in the wrong or not. I (23 M) have been with my boyfriend (26 M) for three years now, and it‚Äôs been‚Ä¶okay. Given the fact that we‚Äôve been long distance for the past year and a half, it‚Äôs going about as good as one could hope. 

We have had this exact conflict I‚Äôm about to describe SEVERAL times throughout our relationship, even from the very beginning. He goes on these little benders once every few months where he goes a couple weeks drinking nearly every night. Not every night, but the vast majority of the nights during these periods. And usually he only gets actually drunk on a few of these nights, and the rest he has maybe 1-3 drinks. This time, this ‚Äúbender‚Äù started two weeks ago when he went to a baseball game and had ~5 tall boys. I haven‚Äôt actually kept track of which days since he has drank and what days he hasn‚Äôt, but I do know that between then and now he has had at least one or two drinks on 9 of the last 12 days, and he‚Äôs planning on going out a couple of times this weekend so it will end up being like 11 days of the past two weeks. Like I said before, most of the time he doesn‚Äôt actually get drunk, but in this particular instance he has been drunk to the point where I can tell based on phone/text conversations with him maybe 4 times.  Several of these times, he told me he didn‚Äôt even want to drink but he did anyways. 

So I recently brought it up to him that I think he should take a break from drinking for a few days‚Ä¶I intentionally tried to tell him in a casual way as to not make him think I was accusing him of being an alcoholic. It must not have worked, because we‚Äôve been in an argument ever since. No matter how many times I‚Äôve tried to tell him that I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an alcoholic and I think he just gets a little carried away at times and just needs to be conscious of how many nights he spends drinking, he gets extremely defensive and then tells me that I‚Äôm controlling and out of line. The fact that he‚Äôs so defensive about it is kind of a red flag to me, and it does kind of start to make me wonder if there are some bigger issues at hand here‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm too scared to even say that. He says I‚Äôm totally out of line for bringing this up to him and have seriously hurt his feelings because his drinking habits are completely normal and healthy. 

My intent was truly to just make sure that he is aware of his drinking habits, because I know from experience (not with alcohol but in other areas of life) a lot of times you don‚Äôt recognize your own problematic behavior until someone else brings it up.

107,1dr3it0,AITA for reacting to an issue my mom had with me like this?,"Last weekend my family and I (18F) went on a camping trip. As a whole, my dad, my brother, and I take a lot of direction from my mom on what to clean up and pack up, and she often gets very irritated about being asked what to do constantly.

I try to do as much as I can think of on my own, but I always miss something and my mom has said it makes her feel used and like our maid when she has to tell everyone what to do all the time. This makes me feel awful for making her feel that way, but I don't ever manage to do enough to make it better. 

My mom was also angry at my dad for having an attitude before what I did, which might have made things worse.

So, as I'm getting our truck ready for us, I ask if there is anything she wants me to do, and she asks me to put the seat up. Looking back, it's pretty clear that she wanted me to move the middle console into its chair form, but I'm autistic and very literal, and I'd never had to do that before. The only other time she says to ""put the seat up"" is to move the back of her truck seat forward. So, thinking that's what she wanted, that's what I did.

She then called me a r\*tard, and asked me how I could be such an idiot and misunderstand such a simple thing. Thinking that making a joke of it would help (it didn't) I smiled, laughed, and agreed with her. She then told she couldn't look at me with that smirk on my face, and told me to go away. I was confused at how angry she was, but I though we were okay when she didn't say anything else

Once we got home, my mom went to her room to work, and my dad, brother, and I unloaded the camper and truck and put everything away. I had to go into her room a few times to put things away, and I noticed she was colder than usual, but I assumed it was because she was angry at my dad. However, when I asked to come in a third time to put things away, she snapped and asked why I was acting so oblivious.

I wasn't sure what she was talking about, so I asked, and she blew up at me, telling me that she couldn't believe I was so cold that I'd ignore her feelings or how upset I made her earlier, and why I wouldn't try and fix things or comfort her. She said the way I looked at her when earlier made her feel like she was overreacting and crazy, which wasn't my intention at all. I tried to explain this, but she just got angrier because I was arguing and dismissing her feelings. I ended up standing there, waiting until she was done yelling at me, and I tried to apologize, but she told me to leave.

She ignored and was cold to me until I apologized a few more times, made her food, and got her everything she wanted. I feel that I caused the whole situation and dismissed her feelings accidentally, but I also feel angry at her for yelling and calling me names too.

I'd like to know if AITA in this situation, and if so, how I should handle situations like this in the future.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-29,"AITA for reacting to an issue my mom had with me like this? Last weekend my family and I (18F) went on a camping trip. As a whole, my dad, my brother, and I take a lot of direction from my mom on what to clean up and pack up, and she often gets very irritated about being asked what to do constantly.

I try to do as much as I can think of on my own, but I always miss something and my mom has said it makes her feel used and like our maid when she has to tell everyone what to do all the time. This makes me feel awful for making her feel that way, but I don't ever manage to do enough to make it better. 

My mom was also angry at my dad for having an attitude before what I did, which might have made things worse.

So, as I'm getting our truck ready for us, I ask if there is anything she wants me to do, and she asks me to put the seat up. Looking back, it's pretty clear that she wanted me to move the middle console into its chair form, but I'm autistic and very literal, and I'd never had to do that before. The only other time she says to ""put the seat up"" is to move the back of her truck seat forward. So, thinking that's what she wanted, that's what I did.

She then called me a r\*tard, and asked me how I could be such an idiot and misunderstand such a simple thing. Thinking that making a joke of it would help (it didn't) I smiled, laughed, and agreed with her. She then told she couldn't look at me with that smirk on my face, and told me to go away. I was confused at how angry she was, but I though we were okay when she didn't say anything else

Once we got home, my mom went to her room to work, and my dad, brother, and I unloaded the camper and truck and put everything away. I had to go into her room a few times to put things away, and I noticed she was colder than usual, but I assumed it was because she was angry at my dad. However, when I asked to come in a third time to put things away, she snapped and asked why I was acting so oblivious.

108,1dr3bux,WIBTA if I don‚Äôt host my friend who ran away?,"Title says it all, but I‚Äôll elaborate. 

My (19F) friend (19F) posted randomly about her leaving home and needing a place to stay. She didn‚Äôt expand on the details of the situation but I was willing to take her in with open arms. Even though my place isn‚Äôt the greatest, it‚Äôs still better than her sleeping on the street. 

After thinking it over, I didn‚Äôt really feel comfortable letting her into my home without knowing why she left home in the first place. For all I know, I could be harbouring a fugitive! And while I didn‚Äôt believe she was in any legal trouble, I assumed it had something to do with her home life. I know some details about that, but not everything. I also know this is not the first time she‚Äôs ran away from home. 

Her sister (20F) made a very long post on her spam account taking about the struggles of being the older sister who had to sacrifice her childhood and innocence to be another parent to her younger siblings and I related to that a lot; it‚Äôs part of the reason we got  close after we graduated. The post also mentions that she has tried to reason with my friend and that she has given up on trying to be there for her when all she has been is negative and has never been grateful for the sacrifices she had to make. 

I now feel placed in the middle, and quite frankly, I don‚Äôt want to be in it. I am friends with them both, and this issue is between them. My friend asked me not to tell her sister about her whereabouts, and I won‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt find it in me to let her stay with me. I just don‚Äôt want her to end up somewhere unsafe and I would never forgive myself knowing that she came to me for a place to stay and I kicked her to the curb, but at the same time time I am not responsible for her wellbeing and I believe she needs to get things sorted and worked out with her family before I invite her to my home.

My boyfriend(M21) asked when me am I(F21) free to hang so I gave him a date which is 4 days later. I suggested we go visit this flea market then eat afterwards.I told him to decide on a time so its convenient for him since hes the one picking me up from my place and that we could go together to the market. He suggested 11 am, no problem with that. He later on asked me if i wanted to get massages after we visit the flea market and eat, i agreed. Happy to say, we both had a plan for the day.

Day came, excited, i woke up early to do my hair. It was an hour before 11, yet hes still hasn't replied to my memes so i figured hes probably still sleeping. It was no big deal since i was a bit sleepy and could use a nap. I told him to text me when he's awake so i could get ready.

He woke up exactly 11 and texted me, so i told him ill get ready now. He later then inserted that he will picking up his friends first. I got confused since i thought it was a date so I told him why didn't he inform me first. He had 4 days to do so. He told me its not a big deal, its just his friends and that to not make it difficult for him. We argued, he said sorry, but I told him i wont go anymore then he left me on seen. 

He was excited for the market and said sorry to me so I kinda felt bad for throwing a fit and cancelling on him last minute but at the same time I am pissed because this happened many times before. For example, it was my birthday and we had a date planned but he told me last minute that he has practice later on within the day so we had to rush my birthday date. 

My problem isn't his friends, its the fact that he could've told me beforehand since it has happened before, him not informing me of his plans, just a week before to be exact. I told him before to make it clear with me because i get irritated when i get informed late. 

Now I wonder if im wrong for acting like that. ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-29,"AITA for throwing a fit and cancelling on my boyfriend last minute

My husband(25), my brother, and I all live together. My husband and I have two dogs and my brother has one(a 3 year old Cane Corso). I just want to state that prior to this situation that happened today, my husband and I did everything for my brothers dog like he was our own because my brother continuously fails to do so, I mean providing the pup with love, food, attention, shelter, vet care, and training. All my brother has done the past year since he has gotten him is walk into the house, give the pup a pat on the head and a few ‚Äúgood boy scratches‚Äù and has gone on about his day. We have spoken to my brother about this issue countless of times and I even went as far as telling him prior to getting the pup that he as a young dude that likes to go out was not ready for the responsibility, yet no matter what we say or do, he still fails to care for his dog properly.
 
However, regarding this issue, two months ago I told my brother that my husband and I will be taking a 3 day trip to celebrate my husband birthday. I reminded him of the dates, I wrote down on a calendar, I would even randomly text him the dates as a reminder for 2 whole months so that he was prepared to care for his OWN dog while my husband and I were away. We fully understand that our 2 dogs are our responsibility so we made a care plan for them early on and have been able to get our girls boarded for the next 3 days. Earlier today, after getting back from dropping my dogs off, my husband and I come home to my brother‚Äôs dog but no sign of my brother. Initially we assumed he stepped out for a moment until I called him and he informed me that he went to go stay a couple of nights at his girlfriend‚Äôs house 2 cities over. I blew up at him and reminded him that he knew that we were leaving today and he stopped answering my calls. My husband and I didn‚Äôt know what to do so we tried to get him boarded with our two dogs last minute but it was going to cost us $280. I called and texted my brother repeatedly for him to send the money to get his dog boarded and on the 5th call he picks up just to tell me that he doesn‚Äôt have the money, so by this point I‚Äôm pissed off. I load his dog up into the car with his food/food bowls and we drive over to my brother‚Äôs girlfriend house. I bang on the door and his gf answers, I hand her the leash and my husband hands her his supplies and we hit the road. Not even 5 minutes later my brother is calling me mad and upset that I brought his dog over there because it‚Äôs a dangerous situation because his gf dog doesn‚Äôt like other dogs. I told him that wasn‚Äôt my problem or my responsibility and hung up and I have not answered his calls or text.

We have spoken to my brother about this issue countless of times and I even went as far as telling him prior to getting the pup that he as a young dude that likes to go out was not ready for the responsibility, yet no matter what we say or do, he still fails to care for his dog properly.
 
However, regarding this issue, two months ago I told my brother that my husband and I will be taking a 3 day trip to celebrate my husband birthday. I reminded him of the dates, I wrote down on a calendar, I would even randomly text him the dates as a reminder for 2 whole months so that he was prepared to care for his OWN dog while my husband and I were away. We fully understand that our 2 dogs are our responsibility so we made a care plan for them early on and have been able to get our girls boarded for the next 3 days. Earlier today, after getting back from dropping my dogs off, my husband and I come home to my brother‚Äôs dog but no sign of my brother. Initially we assumed he stepped out for a moment until I called him and he informed me that he went to go stay a couple of nights at his girlfriend‚Äôs house 2 cities over. I blew up at him and reminded him that he knew that we were leaving today and he stopped answering my calls. My husband and I didn‚Äôt know what to do so we tried to get him boarded with our two dogs last minute but it was going to cost us $280. I called and texted my brother repeatedly for him to send the money to get his dog boarded and on the 5th call he picks up just to tell me that he doesn‚Äôt have the money, so by this point I‚Äôm pissed off. I load his dog up into the car with his food/food bowls and we drive over to my brother‚Äôs girlfriend house. I bang on the door and his gf answers, I hand her the leash and my husband hands her his supplies and we hit the road. Not even 5 minutes later my brother is calling me mad and upset that I brought his dog over there because it‚Äôs a dangerous situation because his gf dog doesn‚Äôt like other dogs. I told him that wasn‚Äôt my problem or my responsibility and hung up and I have not answered his calls or text. I‚Äôm mainly just wondering if I‚Äôm more or so the AH because I put an innocent pup in a situation to be attacked?",0.0,0.049120329320430756,0,1
115,1dr1zj3,AITA for calling my boyfriend old?,"On mobile sry.

I (22f) love the fourth of july and my family had hosted a cookout for it every year for as long as I can remember

It is always my immediate family, my best friend and her family, another family in the neighborhood and sometimes extended family. But between the usual crew, theres like 10-15 ""kids"" and like 6ish reql adults that have always done this cookout.

Every year, the real adults (aka my parents and my best friend's parents and whatever parentlike adults exist) will stay and talk adult things while me and the other kids take a walk to the local park to watch the fireworks.

The park is on the hill and is the best place to watch the fireworks coz it overlooks the city skyline where the fireworks are set off. I have watched the fireworks from this park, sitting in the same tree, with the same group of people my entire life. Its a big deal for all of us kids coz its really now the only time we see eachother is the fourth and its the only time we're not near our parents so we can really talk about things. And we've done this forever

My boyfriend (29m) has experienced two fourth of julys with me, he doesnt like holidays but i thought he at least tolerated this one for me, and he does, mostly. This year he said we werent going to do the walk to the park because its too long (it is all up hill but its less than a mile and takes about a half hour max and thats even with the yougins in my best friends family).

I told him that he doesnt have to do the walk but i would be because its the best place to watch the fireworks and i love traditions. He said he wasnt going to walk and if i wanted him there we'd have to drive. I said we're not driving coz theres no way we'd get parking any closer than where my parents house is coz its a whole town thing, they close off the nearby streets and all the other streets are packed by the afternoon. We'd end up walking more if we tried to drive.

He put his foot down and said he wasn't going to walk the half hour and I told him ""fine, you can stay back with the other old people"". I meant it as more like you can stay back with the real adults like my parents but my boyfriend got pissed that I called him old coz he's sensitive about our age gap.

I just don't see why he can't walk a mile, he's perfectly abled bodied and capable, just lazy ig.

But i shouldn'tve called him old.

So she said she'd love to make one so after a while the the blanket was complete. 

Her and the elderly lady she works for made this blanket. And the colors were going to be a surprise to me. I literally had showed my sister a picture on the internet of colors that I wanted to see in the blanket. So the day finally comes where I get to open the the box that she had wrapped and it was supposed to be a surprise so I opened it and my first reaction was I loved it it was super soft and it was extremely heavy because the blanket is 10 ft 7 in long and 5 ft wide. But it's extremely ugly it's got a dark hunter green fabric and yellow red white and green threads. 

She told me that her little old lady picked out the colors from hobby lobby. 

Which my sister knows I #ucking hate when she supports those homophobic companies.

After seeing how big the blanket was I told her I could probably sell it for $250 it's so huge I didn't know what to do with it. So she said yeah go ahead and sell it if you want so I posted it on Facebook marketplace. 

For 2 weeks not a single person message me to buy this blanket. 

I marked it down to $100 for one week not a single person message me to buy this blanket. 

It is ugly and I am not exaggerating. I will attach a picture in the comment section below. 

So I told my sister the other day not a single person has messaged me to buy this blanket off of Facebook and so I was going to package it up and mail it off to my cousin.

My sister suggested that I should just throw it away. And I said what are you crazy. And because my cousin lives in Louisiana she went off and said will she literally lives in the hottest f****** place why would she need a blanket? And I said did you not see the comment she posted on Facebook when I posted the blanket she said well I'm glad you have one made for you.

118,1dr1rw2,"AITA for being ""controlling"" during my camping trip with family?","So recently my sister wanted to try camping with her, her husband, and her 2 kids ages 8 and 12 both boys. since she has 0 experience and neither does her husband, she asked me to come with and help out. 

Basically she wanted me to be there to cook the food cause she didn't know how to start a fire properly at a campground, show them where and how to place their tent, recommend/ guide them on activities like hiking rock climbing and kayaking, generally just be a teacher.

I was on board with this because best case, My sister and family get into camping and I get people I can go camping with besides the 2 friends and my girlfriend who are willing to go now or maybe just my nephews will join cub/ scouts not sure which one their in the age group for.

  
the issue was that when we go there the husband (who I generally dislike for having this know it all superior attitude) and the kids are being weirdly controlling and just acting Roudy. 

some gems I will now list

  
1. My BIL was watching me build a fire in the campgrounds firepit and was trying to get me to do stuff the ""right"" way few issues with this, he recommended I started a fire in a different area he said had a better view problem is the spot was a maybe 6 inch deep ditch in the ground that had no grass INSIDE but was surrounded by it, he said kindling was useless and just use lighter fluid/ a fire starter log which I didn't bring. he then tried to say I had no idea what I was doing and called me useless I'M AN EAGLE SCOUT FFS.

2. the boys wanted to whittle some wood and wanted to use my knife. I was ok with this but wanted to give them a crash course on knife safety and then test them so they don't get hurt. I gave the crash course and then waited an hour before giving them the quiz (seeing if they actually retained the info) they failed my 9/10 questions correct threshold and I said they couldn't whittle today and I'd do it again tomorrow. big Suprise my BIL got mad and said I was being unreasonable for such a high pass/fail requirement. I'm not giving kids a knife if they don't know how to use it safely

3. when hiking we had to cross a small stream it wasn't big, fast, or deep but there were rocks the kids were jumping from rock to rock on, I told them to stop because if they slip on the wet rocks they could hit their head and get injured. once again BIL told me It was fine. (I didn't bend and pulled the kids off the rocks don't worry)

these are just 3 and there were more that weren't as insulting or as big of an issue. My sister would back me up on some but just didn't care about the others. after the 4 day trip (the kids got to whittle from day 2 onwards btw) we all went home and I got a text from my mom that I wasn't, and I quote, the ""god of the campgrounds"" and I was wrong to try to control sisters family. my uncle also backed her up and of course my BIL as well.

I tried to approach it kindly a couple other times, but she was similarly dismissive about it, and she still makes the same mistake as a rising 8th grader. I‚Äôve mentioned it to my parents before, but they don't take the issue seriously.

Today, I made a joke to her about not knowing the difference between the three words. We were both playfully teasing/insulting each other, but I definitely went too far with my last comment. \[READ EDIT FOR MORE CONTEXT\] My parents pulled me aside and said that humiliation wasn‚Äôt the way to go. I agree that making fun of her for it was wrong, but when I‚Äôve also tried the nice method I‚Äôm genuinely not sure what to do.

My dad showed me presentation slides of his CEO who misused the word ‚Äòtheir‚Äô on a slide, essentially justifying my sister because his CEO made the same mistake. However, I believe that these situations are completely different - she does not make occasional mistakes but completely messes up the difference, even on English submissions for class. It's not a mistake that extra proofreading would correct, but rather a grammar difference she doesn't understand yet.

I don‚Äôt want to humiliate or bully her into learning it, and I acknowledge that it was wrong to do that, but I still want her to understand that knowing basic grammar at her age is extremely important and a huge skill in life.

Thank you for the replies, I realize that I'm in the wrong in this situation.

Mistakes like this used to be a big deal when it was me, but I get now that it really isn't that serious. Not a justification, but something that made me realize why I might've felt the need to interfere.

I do want to clarify I don't think this was bullying/harassing. I fully admit I was in the wrong but bullying implies a VERY different thing. I was not insulting her multiple times against her wishes, and my intentions were not malicious.

120,1dr1e79,AITA for telling my friend no one said the game had to be fair?,"So I have a friend and we play GamePigeon a lot together. A game we play a lot is 20 questions, a game where one person chooses a word and the other person has to guess it; only using less than 20 questions to figure it out. About a few days ago, we were playing and she chose a word. Her word was tteokbokki and I had to guess it. The hints she gave me were you would most likely use it in a kitchen, it's a Korean food, and something else but I forgot.

Soon I got the answer and when I got the answer she texted me, ""you better give me big hints when I guess"" and I asked ""why""; she said ""bc I gave you big hints"". Now, I get it, she wanted it to be fair, she wanted me to give her big hints because she gave me big hints but I felt like it didn't matter because there's no rules saying it's supposed to be like that; and we never made some agreement to make the game fair.

So, I told her that if I wanted to give her a big hint, I would, but not really because usually all my hints aren't really big hints. She got mad and told me that I HAD to give her big hints when she would guess a word because she gave me big hints. I was getting mad because she wasn't getting my point and kept on telling her that it's my own choice if I want to give some big hint or not, she can't just tell me to give her big hints all because she gave me big hints. I asked for hints and she decided to give those hints by her choice. I never specifically asked her to give me some ""big hint"" she just gave me those hints and now she's calling them big hints.

I was so mad and tried to keep on telling her my point but she would also keep on saying her point. I told her no one said the game had to be fair and she said no one said the game had to be unfair. I just don't get it, because no matter who I'm playing with, I will give my own hints to them, it doesn't matter if she's my friend or not or if they gave me some big ass hint.

In the end, she was like ""fine, I get it"" and we just let it be.

She got mad and told me that I HAD to give her big hints when she would guess a word because she gave me big hints. I was getting mad because she wasn't getting my point and kept on telling her that it's my own choice if I want to give some big hint or not, she can't just tell me to give her big hints all because she gave me big hints. I asked for hints and she decided to give those hints by her choice. I never specifically asked her to give me some ""big hint"" she just gave me those hints and now she's calling them big hints.

I was so mad and tried to keep on telling her my point but she would also keep on saying her point. I told her no one said the game had to be fair and she said no one said the game had to be unfair. I just don't get it, because no matter who I'm playing with, I will give my own hints to them, it doesn't matter if she's my friend or not or if they gave me some big ass hint.

In the end, she was like ""fine, I get it"" and we just let it be. I lied to her and said ""we're good now"" but no, I'm just raging at this thought every time I think about it because it just angers me. So, AITA for telling my friend no one said the game had to be fair?",1.0,0.2545609176158905,0,0

When I was in 3rd grade I started wearing glasses because I couldn't see far she was the first person to tell me I looked beautiful in them (because I was insecure about how I looked in them) and that we can match because she wears glasses as well.

Well fast forward to today I went over to my cousin's and her soon be wife (25 F) house to talk about last minute preparation of the wedding and all the fun stuff when we started talking about pictures of the wedding and this is where Jordan (my cousins fianc√©) told me that I should take off my glasses for the wedding and wear contacts because she doesn't want them to ruin her wedding photos and that I would look like an outcast/ all of attention would be drawn to me if im the only one wearing glasses. To say I was shocked was understatement I always been used to my glasses and I never took them off, I personally don't want to use contacts because it's so much work and I am a forgetful person and might end up sleeping with them on or something like that. I told Jordan that I wouldn't be comfortable with it and that contacts cost money  since I have to get them in my prescription which would take a while as well as I much rather wear my glasses because im more comfortable with them on. She told me Im being unreasonable and that my cousin is wearing contacts for the wedding so I should be a good cousins and not ruin the wedding pictures if not she will tell my cousin to remove me from the wedding and I can attend as an guest.

At the time, **they accepted everything and were very grateful.** We talk for 20 minutes, then they say they're busy and should leave.

Though our friendship has been very on and off, I‚Äôve always considered her a close friend. After we graduated high school last year we‚Äôve started to drift apart. I decided to go straight to college and She decided to take a gap year. The last time we hung out was in November at my birthday party. So it‚Äôs been about 7 months since we‚Äôve seen each other. 

Jay recently expressed that she wanted to start hanging out more. She asked me if I wanted to take a weekend trip to NYC, but I told her that I‚Äôm extremely broke and wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay for a hotel. I suggested going to Philly instead because it‚Äôs way closer, cheaper, and I‚Äôm more familiar with the city( unlike nyc where I‚Äôve only been one time) She was really opposed to the idea and suggested that we only take a day trip instead of a whole weekend. I really didn‚Äôt want to do this but I felt bad because she‚Äôs been asking to hang out for the past month and I didn‚Äôt want to say no again.

 She‚Äôs been saying she feels like I don‚Äôt like her, but that‚Äôs not true at all. I‚Äôve just been a bit depressed and confused. I haven‚Äôt even left my house since the semester ended in march. Even though I didn‚Äôt want to go, I had still planned on going until yesterday. Which is 3 days before the trip. My grandmother recently got pneumonia and had to be taken to the hospital 2 days ago. I‚Äôm extremely concerned due to the fact this was her second time going to the hospital this month and pneumonia can be very serious for someone of her age and amount of health issues. This was really the last thing that pushed me to tell Jay that I would have to cancel. After I told her she was rightfully upset. She said that because I canceled so late she wouldn‚Äôt even have time to plan with someone else. I understand this but I couldn‚Äôt have predicted my grandmother getting sick. I couldn‚Äôt imagine being in NY while something serious happens back at home. She then said that she‚Äôs feels like I don‚Äôt like her anymore. Which is far from the truth.

I decided to go straight to college and She decided to take a gap year. The last time we hung out was in November at my birthday party. So it‚Äôs been about 7 months since we‚Äôve seen each other. 

Jay recently expressed that she wanted to start hanging out more. She asked me if I wanted to take a weekend trip to NYC, but I told her that I‚Äôm extremely broke and wouldn‚Äôt be able to pay for a hotel. I suggested going to Philly instead because it‚Äôs way closer, cheaper, and I‚Äôm more familiar with the city( unlike nyc where I‚Äôve only been one time) She was really opposed to the idea and suggested that we only take a day trip instead of a whole weekend. I really didn‚Äôt want to do this but I felt bad because she‚Äôs been asking to hang out for the past month and I didn‚Äôt want to say no again.

 She‚Äôs been saying she feels like I don‚Äôt like her, but that‚Äôs not true at all. I‚Äôve just been a bit depressed and confused. I haven‚Äôt even left my house since the semester ended in march. Even though I didn‚Äôt want to go, I had still planned on going until yesterday. Which is 3 days before the trip. My grandmother recently got pneumonia and had to be taken to the hospital 2 days ago. I‚Äôm extremely concerned due to the fact this was her second time going to the hospital this month and pneumonia can be very serious for someone of her age and amount of health issues. This was really the last thing that pushed me to tell Jay that I would have to cancel. After I told her she was rightfully upset. She said that because I canceled so late she wouldn‚Äôt even have time to plan with someone else. I understand this but I couldn‚Äôt have predicted my grandmother getting sick. I couldn‚Äôt imagine being in NY while something serious happens back at home. She then said that she‚Äôs feels like I don‚Äôt like her anymore. Which is far from the truth. I love her, I‚Äôve just had a lot going on recently. 
Now I just feel like a bad person. AITA?

131,1dqzm1l,AITA for not allowing my daughter to diet?,"I (44F) have a (15F) daughter named Marie. Marie has lately been complaining about her weight and has asked me if she can go on a low calorie diet. I told her that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy for a girl her age to diet, and that she‚Äôs beautiful the way she is. She‚Äôs been pouting ever since and has made comments like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just trying to keep me fat like you!‚Äù, and has left me wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole.

We have healthy options available in the house, lots of fruits and vegetables are available. However, I will admit these aren‚Äôt always the main part of a meal. She has two younger siblings who are notoriously picky eaters and have some sensory issues, so we cook what they‚Äôll eat. But we always have fruits and vegetables available as a side, and we cook at home. Marie is angry with me because I‚Äôm not allowing her to go low carb and low calorie, and my husband is telling me that I should allow her to do what she wants. AITA?

For those who might be wondering, she‚Äôs 5‚Äô4 and 150 pounds, if that changes your verdict. 


Edit:

I‚Äôve taken her to the doctor, they say her weight is normal.

She‚Äôs in multiple sports and she‚Äôs very active.

By catering the meals to my younger two, I mean stuff like keeping the sauce and mushrooms separate and stuff like that. My daughter is always asked what meals she would like to eat at the beginning of the week.
