0,1ds8m7p,AITA for telling my stepdad to respect me?,"I'm a 17 year old male. My stepfather, 60M, is very religious and conservative when it comes to tradition. This, while we do have opposite views, never really got in the way of our relationship. We weren't super close yet we also weren't enemies. 

It wasn't until last night when my step sister, let's call her M (30F) came over to visit. M and my stepdad somehow got into an argument about politics. He was always talking and complaining about politics, so I was used to this. After a bit, I decided to join in and just listen. They would then ask me questions and I'd have my input, which was always the opposite of what my stepfather thought. This went on for about an hour or two before things became personal, my stepfather admitting he believes I will be going to hell if I don't accept Jesus Christ as my Savior and for being trans and openly gay. 

I told him that I do not believe in God. That turned into a whole other new thing since he never knew until then. He was saying how his point of view on religion is the true answer and how if I want to make it to Heaven, I need to repent more or less. I told him how can I if I don't believe in Heaven or Hell? And why should it affect his relationship with me, just because I'm not religious? I told him all I ever wanted was him to respect my choices. I made it clear this doesn't mean he has to like it, just to respect it. He then says ""Oh, well I'm sorry... I'm sorry that you don't accept God."" I was dumbfounded. I told him this is why I don't go to him for much, of which he then begins to blame my biological mother, saying how I never touched a church in my life (I grew up catholic, went to a child's Catholic sunday school, and worked at a Catholic church for kids.) 

After all of that, he left the room out of silence after I kept telling him how it shouldn't matter if he agrees with me on this or not and he should just respect it. It's the next day and I now can't help but feel bad. Did I go too far? 

For context, I have been out for 4 years now and I knew his views on my lifestyle. He always fought with my mom about it, saying how I'm going to Hell and my mom shouldn't be okay with that.

1,1drzmvj,UPDATE AITA for taking my stepson on outings without my son?,"[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dq56vb/aita_for_taking_my_stepson_on_outings_without_my/)

First of all I want to thank everyone who gave comments. I felt some of the comments and messages I received were judgemental and hurtful, but accepted that most people seemed to think I was the Asshole in the situation, so rather than defend myself my priority was to make things right with my son Mark.

I spoke to him and opened up by telling him how much I loved him and how I wouldn't change anything about him, and that he inherited all of the qualities I loved so much about his mother. He seemed pretty confused when I said that and said he really appreciated it but asked where it was coming from.

I told him that I heard that he was getting jealous about the time I was spending with Luke 1 on 1, and that I'd hate for him to think or feel that I was abandoning him by spending time with Luke. He then had a bit of an embarrassed look on his face and reassured me that he didn't feel abandoned or jealous of Luke. I then mentioned how May said otherwise, and he then visibly cringe.

He then told me that he was jealous, but of me rather than Luke. That he thought Luke was incredibly nice to him when they first met and was really excited to have a friend like him since most of his friends through his school and clubs are girls. That he'd like to spend more time hanging out just the two of them, but he's much interested in hanging out with me rather than him.

I instantly felt relief about the situation, and asked if he's spoke to Luke about hanging out more, and he said that he hasn't as he didn't know what to ask to do or to come across as weird. I asked what they both had in common, and he said they liked similar video games, music and films/tv, so I offered to buy them both tickets to any upcoming film they'd both want to see and that if there are any upcoming concerts or gigs that they'd want to go to, that I'd buy them tickets if that's something they'd like.

Mark was really happy at that suggestion, as well as Luke and Laura. Especially Laura because Luke doesn't really have many friends and she was really worried about how he would get on if there was any blending of families. So turns out they were both wanting to be better friends with eachother but neither one wanted to express it out of fear of rejection from the other.",UPDATE,2024-06-30,"UPDATE AITA for taking my stepson on outings without my son?

throughout our relationship, it was rough. our relationship started due to a previous relationship of mine ending, and he instantly started lovebombing me and pushing the idea of getting together into my head no matter how many times i made it clear that i was trying to heal. i felt as if i couldn’t say no because he had already spent upwards to $600 on me
from the day we got together he made me share my location with him, as well as guilting me into sharing the password to all my accounts by sending me his and telling me it’s “just what couples do.” after he got my location, he would check it constantly and ask where i was and what i was doing. anytime i would go out with friends. though anytime he would go out with his friends, he would turn his location off, and “accidentally” send me pictures of him being uncomfortably close with his friends. then when i claim it made me uncomfortable he would say that i was being dramatic and then have his friends and family speak up and tell me that it’s “not a big deal.” making me feel crazy for being uncomfy 
he would yell, break things, shit talk people in my life, so on and so forth. leaving me isolated, i only had him, which led me to be genuinely brainwashed into thinking everything was okay. anytime we were in public i would be shamed or put down and controlled by him.

then, our relationship ended due to him ignoring me for girl he had met at work. the day we broke up he went out with her all day and stayed in a parking lot for 2 hours, ignoring my texts and calls. later that day he came over to my house, i set a boundary with him about it, he didn’t like it and we eventually broke up. he came out as straight 
thought out our relationship he would spread rumors and claim nasty things about his ex, so i brought up how i don’t want us to end on bad terms and how i would appreciate it if we just kept everything neutral since we had to see eachother for school and we share some friends. he then went on to tell me that if i “didn’t go say he was abusive or a bad person then he wouldn’t say bad things about me” which left a horrible taste in my mouth.
which i put two n two together and realized that was exactly what had happened to his ex who had claimed he was abusive. 

about a week later, he got with the girl that he had cheated on me with. as well as bad mouthed me to his friends. a decently large amount of alcohol later, i spoke up to one of our shared friends about everything he had done to me. his reaction was shocked. as well as everyone else in my life that i’ve spoken up to. with all that though, i’m second guessing if i was the asshole and i deserved what had happened to me and faced the consequences of my actions in the relationship.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-30,"AITAH in my past relationship?

6,1drpubj,AITA for blowing up at my director?,"Throwaway account; I (30M) an actor who works primarily in the dubbing scene. I play mostly bit parts, mainly side characters. I'm fine with it, truth be told- I've seen the stress of the job, and I kinda like having some privacy. Anyways, the main focus of the story is a pretty heated argument I got into with a director. This happened a while back, and something came up with that director, but I wanted to avoid stirring a pot so I've opted to post it now. Reflecting on it tells me I'm the jerk, but I wanted to get some feedback.

Director has always been a pretty harsh person; they're on the older side, and have admittedly played a few big parts in some pretty cool anime from here and there. However, they are horribly irritable and passive aggressive to others. They used to be a pretty big deal, but now they've settled for being a director. I have heard and even SEEN actors who have worked with them in the past, and they spared no detail of them being a pretty fucking awful person. I saw make a guy I'm friends with nearly cry in the booth because of them being way too harsh. Thankfully, I usually work with some of the more 'chill' and younger directors, but whenever they were in the studio, it was...tense, for lack of a better word.

So, we were recording for a pretty big project that came out recently; and unfortunately, because that project was big, they opted for this director to take the helm. I was cast as some extras in the project, people you'd probably barely notice. Day of recording, I was out of it due to some personal troubles and lack of sleep. I'm usually a friendly person, but today I was just so hair trigger ready to pounce from any sort of issue. I wasn't putting 100% into my lines, something the director picked up on.

They started chewing me out; stuff like ""young people think they can do anything, huh"" and ""are you really SURE this is the job you want"". I had enough of it, and started telling them off, calling them a whole load of things- I called them a witch, a horrible director, and that I didn't care who or what they voiced in- I was just out of it today. If she was expecting an Oscar nominated performance from a character who maybe had ten lines in total, then her bar is way too high. Director was pretty stunned by my reaction, and I quickly came to my senses after yelling. I didn't know what else to do, so I just finished up recording my takes, and quickly ran out.

On her last day here (about a week ago), she said she’d like to get dinner together. Dinner in this case meant getting the food and then bringing it home to eat.

This conversation happened around 2-3 in the afternoon. 6-7 rolls around, I ask what we’re feeling - my mother and grandmother are undecided. At around 8-8:30 ish, madre comes saying okay, we’re going. “Going where?” To fetch dinner. I say no, I have work tomorrow and I go to bed at 9 (I work full time 8-5). She says that I knew this (dinner) was coming, I have a duty to my family, and that it’s my grandmothers last day over. I say I’m not risking my job (recently started, fairly intense) by being late because I overslept, and that I can’t. 

Standing in my doorway, she proceeds to call me a disappointment, then a disappointment to specifically my family, that if I wasn’t going to act like a part of this family I wouldn’t be a part of this family, useless, and some more.  I said I wasn’t asking for anything unreasonable. She said she’s risked so much at her job for her family. I agreed but said that she, like me, would not risk her job to get L&L Barbecue takeout. My response wasn’t received well. 

My mother and father (he wasn’t present for her “speech”) then went to get the food, and while they were gone I left to stay with my boyfriend for the night. Before I left, I did talk to my grandmother and apologized that I wouldn’t be there for dinner, but that to keep things civil, it was probably best for me to not be present at the moment.

9,1drpbi5,AITA For Calling Police on My Neighbors?,"I (22F) live in an okay neighborhood with my Mom (62F) and Aunt (68F). It's carved up between slumlord rentals and homeowners so we either have to involve police for domestic affairs or handle it ourselves. I try not to get involved with anything since domestic affairs range from the sleazeball across the street kicking out the girlfriend of the week to drag racing to drug deals (nothing serious in the past few years, just weed and maybe mushrooms).

We've had a problem with extremely loud music the past year. Like the walls shake and you can hear it a block away. I know of three parties that do this. One is my neighbor (28M) and his friends across the street who insist on parking in the empty lot by our house. They work late and will pull up at 1 AM blasting shitty country and rock for five minutes and go to bed. The second is a family that has sporadic parties and they live one block away. These parties are random and last between noon to well into morning with nonstop music.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my neighbor (27F) who also lives with her mom (61F). I've talked with her about her music and dog. I have chronic migraines and both are aware of it. She'll sit in her car at night blasting music and smoking weed. The neighbor who moved in a year ago (35M) has started retaliating with his own music whenever she does this or her dog is outside barking, which is always. This has been my life for three months now.

I'm tired of having a migraine every day and I can't keep popping ibuprofen and Excedrin like candy. My vision has started to be affected by the migraines when I only had the head pains. I can't sleep. I work from home and my work has been significantly impacted. I've resorted to calling the police (nonemergency line) whenever they do this. I don't care who it is or what but I give grace of 15 minutes if I can physically feel the music and an hour if it's just my head starting to throb. I understand people are entitled to having fun in their house, but this has gotten ridiculous.

My Mom works with police (not in law enforcement but deals with them frequently enough) and says this is a waste of resources and their time. She's also worried about 27F losing her job at the county jail and her Mom getting upset since they're friends. Not necessarily at us, but just the whole situation. My Mom insists others should be calling if I am so I should lay off so they can take the heat but I've never had to give my name or information. I don't know what else to do and feel like I'm going crazy from the music or being gaslit that this is normal. AITA?

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: These people are the only consistently loud ones. 90% of the loudness has come from 3 of the 4 people and has increased recently in the past three months and was already consistently loud for a year. The other 10% from your general passing cars with loud motors, construction, and such which is fine and reasonable! I don't mind parties or loud things and don't expect it to be quiet 24/7, but I also don't expect it to be loud 24/7. We've never been a loud neighborhood in the 20 years I've lived here and police have been responding since the noise ordinance is heavily enforced. I checked my NextDoor app to see if anyone else said anything and others have begun calling too. I'm also aware of the noise ordinance and have been following the guidelines.

11,1drp8u7,AITA for confiding in a superior?,"I was part of a project for a few weeks. There were 8 of us on the team from a few different offices, 7 female + 1 guy. A week into the project, I found out from coworker A that the guy (B) has been harassing coworker C. I immediately wished she hadn’t told me because 1. sitting idly by while B harasses C isn’t easy, especially when C doesn’t know I know, 2. it was a violation of C’s trust, & 3. I knew this man is in the process of transferring to a new location & it made me wonder if he was acting shady at his old location.

C said she didn’t want to get HR involved, as told by A, even as harassment continued.

Well, our project ended last week. I couldn’t find anywhere on our company site to submit an anonymous complaint - which would have been simply “B is acting unprofessionally & harassing female coworkers”. That way, nobody was named & it would be a red flag on his file if something has happened before or happens in the future.

I asked a superior, in confidence, where to submit an *anonymous* complaint. Emphasis on the ANONYMOUS. She was digging for information, so finally I said, “B has been harassing C.” That’s it. I know revealing that info is likely what makes me TA. The superior said she would look into it & get back to me.

What she did *instead* was CALL TEAMMATE A, who was in charge of our team, & *ask her why she hadn’t said anything*. So A calls me up & said she wishes I hadn’t said anything & I don’t have all the details & how C wanted to say something herself if she said anything, etc. I clarified & said I didn’t say anything about any details, & that I had stressed to our supervisor that I wanted it to be *anonymous*, & how I should have said it didn’t matter why when she kept asking.

A little bit later, my supervisor texted me & said, “I took care of it for you. Your name is down as a witness. This is what I replied:

“I really, truly wanted my complaint to be anonymous. The only reason I asked in confidence is because I couldn’t find anything online. I had no plans of mentioning C’s name, only that B was being unprofessional & making people feel uncomfortable so that it would be a red flag on his file if he’d done it before or anyone came forward in the future. Especially because I never witnessed anything. The only info I have is because I got it secondhand. I apologize if I put you in a position where you felt like you needed to take it further than providing the information for an anonymous complaint. I shouldn’t have revealed any identifying information about anyone.“

She replied, “Don’t apologize. When you said you witnessed it, I had to make sure she felt safe and supported.”

I said, “I feel like I must, especially if anything I said gave the impression I witnessed anything,” BECAUSE I DIDN’T.

14,1drox8q,WIBTA if I asked my flatmate’s partner to cover a larger part of her rent than me and my GF?,"Okay, vital context: I (21) live with my gf (22), my gf’s sister (27) and her gf (23). We pay £2200 for a house and the agreement when we moved in was that we’d all pay £550 each as all of us have about the same financial situation. Bills were to be split evenly too.

Basically, when we moved in we were 99% that gf sister’s gf (let’s call her H) would be able to pay her part of the rent whether she was employed or not because of the benefit system here in the UK. She’s been unemployed for a couple months because the company she’s been working with decided to shut down her store entirely and revamp it with an entirely new staff. Since then, she’s been claiming that her mental health is simply not good enough to find work, and we all understood. However, when we said it was okay for her to take her time, we also thought she’d be getting the entirety of her side of her rent through benefit, but due to some circumstances outside of our control, she will not be able to claim it. So, essentially, we have been splitting the rent three ways instead of four for the last three months. This has been straining all of our financial situations, and has been making us pretty short on money even for food.

Because my gf and I have certain plans we want to save up money for, I brought it up with her that we should probably ask her sister to cover a little more of H’s rent than us for the meantime in which she cannot provide for herself at all. I said I’d be happy to pay maybe about £100-150 more a month, but not entire £200 and especially if H’s unemployment length is indefinite. Gf’s sister would have to cover what H cannot, and my gf agreed that this would be a good plan as, although we’d still be helping out as best we can when even we don’t have much in this living crisis, we wouldn’t be feeling the need to skip meals just to travel to and from work. 

When I hinted this idea at gf’s sister, she seemed to take it entirely personal and went off about how you'd never do that to friends and that we should all be supporting each other. However, half a year ago when I was unemployed due to severe anxiety disorder issues, neither one of them seemed to be happy to step up and cover my side
of the rent while I got back up on my feet. So then my question is, WIBTA if I asked my gf's sister to cover a larger portion of her GF's rent because neither me nor my gf can afford to continue overpaying by £200-250?


EDIT:

I’m getting a lot of very helpful advice here and I am glad that everyone so far has agreed with me that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to cover for H. However, some of you aren’t quite understanding the big picture as much as you agree with me, so let me explain:

H and gf’s sister are FAMILY. In no way would I ever want H to live on the streets even if she can’t pay her bills, nor would I want gf’s sister to be in financial hell because she’s covering double the rent on a low salary, which is why I want to help them BOTH. The four of us have a lot of history, a lot of things we’ve gotten through together, and the relationship is better than just “you can’t get a job and pay? oof, sorry bro, move tf out.” If it was as easy as that I wouldn’t be on reddit asking for advice. The only issue I’ve struggled with is mainly finding a way to make sure that I am NOT putting myself in shit to cover someone else who could probably find different ways to figure it out.

However, when we said it was okay for her to take her time, we also thought she’d be getting the entirety of her side of her rent through benefit, but due to some circumstances outside of our control, she will not be able to claim it. So, essentially, we have been splitting the rent three ways instead of four for the last three months. This has been straining all of our financial situations, and has been making us pretty short on money even for food.

Because my gf and I have certain plans we want to save up money for, I brought it up with her that we should probably ask her sister to cover a little more of H’s rent than us for the meantime in which she cannot provide for herself at all. I said I’d be happy to pay maybe about £100-150 more a month, but not entire £200 and especially if H’s unemployment length is indefinite. Gf’s sister would have to cover what H cannot, and my gf agreed that this would be a good plan as, although we’d still be helping out as best we can when even we don’t have much in this living crisis, we wouldn’t be feeling the need to skip meals just to travel to and from work. 

When I hinted this idea at gf’s sister, she seemed to take it entirely personal and went off about how you'd never do that to friends and that we should all be supporting each other. However, half a year ago when I was unemployed due to severe anxiety disorder issues, neither one of them seemed to be happy to step up and cover my side
of the rent while I got back up on my feet. So then my question is, WIBTA if I asked my gf's sister to cover a larger portion of her GF's rent because neither me nor my gf can afford to continue overpaying by £200-250?


EDIT:

I’m getting a lot of very helpful advice here and I am glad that everyone so far has agreed with me that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to cover for H. However, some of you aren’t quite understanding the big picture as much as you agree with me, so let me explain:

H and gf’s sister are FAMILY. In no way would I ever want H to live on the streets even if she can’t pay her bills, nor would I want gf’s sister to be in financial hell because she’s covering double the rent on a low salary, which is why I want to help them BOTH. The four of us have a lot of history, a lot of things we’ve gotten through together, and the relationship is better than just “you can’t get a job and pay? oof, sorry bro, move tf out.” If it was as easy as that I wouldn’t be on reddit asking for advice. The only issue I’ve struggled with is mainly finding a way to make sure that I am NOT putting myself in shit to cover someone else who could probably find different ways to figure it out.

17,1dsf1s8,AITA for fleeing from a friend's party?,"Recently, my best friend turned 18. And since that is an age you'll want to celebrate, he threw a party with ten of his friends (including me). Now, most of these were people I didn't know yet. As the one who livrs closes to him, I was the one to arrive first. I had decided that that would be the best thing to do for me. I am an introvert, and being around that many strangers in a festive setting isn't optimal for me. At least this way I could remain seated, have my own spot, embed myself in the sofa.  
  
So, the two of us just sit there for a while, I get a drink, we chat a bit. That's when the rest of his friends begin arriving, one after another. Before I know it, all seats in the living room are taken. The gifts go around, and I just sit there in awkward silence in the corner of my soft sofa. After everybody has received a drink, the party host prepares a game of shuffleboard. As the teams for the game were being made, everybody gathered around the table. Except for me, of course. And while the teams are being made, I am almost completely forgotten. If it weren't for one of his friends calling me out, I wouldn't have been in the game. Which I still wasn't. I awkwardly declined the offer to join in, and just remained on my spot while watching the rest of the group play competitively.   
  
Eventually, it became too much for me. Lying that I would take a quick bathroom break (His toilet is in the hallway leading to the front door), I sneakily took my shoes and jacket and ran away without saying a word, heading straight towards my own safe home, away from this terror that is an adolescent party. My friend is aware of my poor social skills, but he hasn't contacted me since that day. I still feel bad for fleeing from the party, and I could've expected that it wouldn't be my thing, but I also feel like it was a bad idea of his to invite me. He's perfectly aware of how bad I am with strangers, and knows that I didn't know any of his friends.

Now here’s where I said that they were being unfair because she has mentioned multiple times that she has depression and I think we could cut her some slack in this sense because it’s difficult struggling with mental health and dealing with a bunch of teenagers. This led to a argument where my friends said that they shouldn’t be expected to deal with that because it’s not their issue and that she’s just lazy. It is true that her class average is lower (quite significantly) than the other teacher’s and I agreed that if this was because of her mental health she should’ve stepped back. BUT I also pointed out to this person that if you push this teacher and trouble her a bit for feedback and keep sending her practice (instead of being busy on your laptop during the free sessions and making fun of her) she actually responds really well and clearly puts in effort when you show her you care about- I myself having gone up a whole grade in just six months. Here everyone said I was being an AH for assuming that they don’t put in the the effort and blaming students instead of the adult using mental health as an ‘excuse’ but I really was just trying to be a little understanding but I also think my friend might have a point.

19,1dsenka,AITA for apologizing?,"I am an examiner for a professional credential. About three years ago, I failed a candidate for having a portfolio that was below standard. At the time I felt that it was borderline and in need of remedial work, but the external examiner argued that for the sake of overall professional standards, it would be better if the portfolio failed outright. Remedial work would have required him to amend the portfolio with a two-week deadline, and if that was satisfactory, he’d be awarded a pass. Failing outright just means that he fails and needs to wait for the next sitting (usually within no more than a few months). He is a fairly competent guy and has a good reputation, so I did feel bad but I found it hard to argue against the extern so I did ultimately go with that.

I gave the candidate some advice on how to prepare for their next time. Unfortunately, the examiner at the next sitting disagreed with my preferences and highlighted those sections as particular weaknesses when the candidate represented – and they failed their portfolio again. This had some knock-on effects on their career, and they lost their training contract.

The good news is that they actually managed to pass in the long run and even managed to get a new training contract for the balance of time required for certification. I ran into them at a conference late last year and apologized for any role I had in their problems and specifically mentioned how it was pressure from the external examiner that resulted in that first fail. He clearly didn’t expect this and got a bit tongue-tied, but I thought we had made some progress in repairing a relationship in case our paths cross again.

However, I happened to meet him last week and he asked me how I knew that he had encountered difficulties after that first exam given that I hadn’t acted as an examiner subsequently. I couldn’t really answer that as I technically shouldn’t have known about it. I began to worry that apologizing might have made him feel worse (I did notice that he had never said if he’d accepted it or not and he's clearly still thinking about it). I probably shouldn’t have but I did ask him if it would have been better if I hadn’t said anything. At that stage, he just said that he didn’t know if apologizing was a good idea or not, made an unconvincing excuse and left.

I feel really bad now. I thought that explaining that the work wasn’t that bad initially would have made him feel better but it does seem to have done the opposite. Ultimately, everything worked out and he is certified and employed. I’m obviously not saying that I’m a victim in any of this but I really was just trying to make him feel better and trying to reduce any awkwardness if we were to happen to work together in the future.

23,1dsdxtc,AITA for complaining on a hike?,"My boyfriend and I are in our thirties and part of a weekly hiking group. He’s been hiking with this group for years, but I just joined them last year, so this will be my second full season hiking with them. They’re lovely people and I’ve enjoyed my time with them.

The hiking group is pretty fit and the leader picks very difficult hikes, so I’ve never been able to keep up because I have asthma. Last year, my boyfriend would hang back with me, but I felt bad it meant he wasn’t hiking with the others, so I often apologized and thanked him, and reassured him that it’s okay if he wants to go ahead with the others. Usually, we’d stop and admire the flowers or the view, or goof off in other ways. Over the past year, I’ve put so much work into staying in shape, improving my cardio fitness, so I can get outdoors and keep up with normal people. I know it sounds silly, but it would mean so much to me if I could just keep up with the group.

On our last hike, the issue came up. Over the past 2 or 3 hikes I’ve noticed that he’ll still hang back with me, but go a ways ahead and stop and look down and wait for me to catch up a bit. I figured he just wanted to do longer spurts of hiking before resting, since on the really steep parts I can only go about 50 paces before needing to stop and catch my breath. But on this last hike, I noticed a change in his demeanor when we were near the top. I had just complained about how steep the hike was, because I was going so slowly, and when I returned to commenting on how beautiful the view was and admiring the flowers, he grumbled. He went ahead by probably 100ft in elevation, would watch me catch up a little, and then he’d go further ahead. He wasn’t letting me catch up, and I realized he didn’t want to hike with me, but also didn’t want to leave me. My heart sank.

Later, I asked him about it. For the first time, he said that it makes him *SO* uncomfortable when I complain about my asthma or speed of my hiking, or really mentioning it at all. I would just vent during the worst parts, and not angrily (not directed at him), but through commentary. He said that he wants to hike with me, but not if I’m doing that. He hasn’t explained why exactly it makes him so uncomfortable in the first place, though. I’m conflicted here because I know what it’s like to be around really negative people and negativity can bring you down, so I really get that. I’d hate to think that’s what I was doing. And a little shocked, because on a normal day he calls me an optimist and has previously called me a ray of sunshine, many times. I’m not usually negative at all.

On the other hand I’m hurt he didn’t empathize with my experience during the hike, and would walk ahead to avoid hiking with me. I kinda wish he had just told me a long time ago. It also wasn’t the only thing that would come out of my mouth. I was happy to be out there, and happy to admire the scenery and talk about other things.

AITA?",No A-holes here,2024-06-30,"AITA for complaining on a hike? My boyfriend and I are in our thirties and part of a weekly hiking group. He’s been hiking with this group for years, but I just joined them last year, so this will be my second full season hiking with them. They’re lovely people and I’ve enjoyed my time with them.

The hiking group is pretty fit and the leader picks very difficult hikes, so I’ve never been able to keep up because I have asthma. Last year, my boyfriend would hang back with me, but I felt bad it meant he wasn’t hiking with the others, so I often apologized and thanked him, and reassured him that it’s okay if he wants to go ahead with the others. Usually, we’d stop and admire the flowers or the view, or goof off in other ways. Over the past year, I’ve put so much work into staying in shape, improving my cardio fitness, so I can get outdoors and keep up with normal people. I know it sounds silly, but it would mean so much to me if I could just keep up with the group.

On our last hike, the issue came up. Over the past 2 or 3 hikes I’ve noticed that he’ll still hang back with me, but go a ways ahead and stop and look down and wait for me to catch up a bit. I figured he just wanted to do longer spurts of hiking before resting, since on the really steep parts I can only go about 50 paces before needing to stop and catch my breath. But on this last hike, I noticed a change in his demeanor when we were near the top. I had just complained about how steep the hike was, because I was going so slowly, and when I returned to commenting on how beautiful the view was and admiring the flowers, he grumbled. He went ahead by probably 100ft in elevation, would watch me catch up a little, and then he’d go further ahead. He wasn’t letting me catch up, and I realized he didn’t want to hike with me, but also didn’t want to leave me. My heart sank.

Later, I asked him about it. For the first time, he said that it makes him *SO* uncomfortable when I complain about my asthma or speed of my hiking, or really mentioning it at all.

we hiked for about 2 hours before finally arriving at the top, where it was pretty cold  and windy because of the high altitude. because of this, most people, including us, started layering up and putting on more coats hats, gloves, and other warm clothes. many people were also taking pictures of them at the top looking out at the view. 

after taking pictures and looking around, the four of us sat down on a rock to chat and have some food. soon after, two girls (probably in their early to mid 20s) came up to me and my friends in very large and poofy fur coats, boots and hats. they were giggling as one of them asked handed me their phone and if i could take a picture of them. I agreed and they walked up to the edge where they wanted their photos taken. 

suddenly, both girls start stripping, taking off their coats and shirts, leaving them just in bras, a thong, and their hats and boots. they were giggling as they posed in really strange and inappropriate poses, trying to show off their bodies and the fact that they were almost naked in the cold weather. 

i thought that this was really strange and inappropriate, and i told them that i was not comfortable taking their pictures. they looked visibly upset and asked why and if i could please just take the pictures, and when i refused they got angry, put they're coats back on, and walked away to ask someone else.

and walked back over and sat down with my friends, and my one friend asked why i didn't just take their picture. i told her that i thought it was weird to take pictures of half naked strangers, and that i did not feel comfortable doing so. she said that they were just trying to have fun, and that i overreacted and should have just taken the pictures for them. my boyfriend agrees with me and her boyfriend agrees with her.

28,1dsdke8,AITA for wanting my girlfriend who's a recovering alcoholic to not drink?,"My(35M) girlfriend ""Jess"" (36F) got sober almost a year before we met(Been together about 1.5 years). She was open with me about it early on and as long as she stayed sober I was fine with that. I was actually proud of her too because she realized it was a problem on her own and addressed it before it really impacted her life in a serious way

A quick story about me that's relevant to all this. I had a very close friend in college, the type that your other friends are surprised when they ever see one of you without the other. He was addicted to Adderall in highschool  and got sober before college. While there were other friends who knew, I was the only one aware of the full extent. Eventually he started taking some for late nite studying and it progressed more and more until he was basically merged with the couch playing World of Warcraft and blowing Adderall for 3 days straight without sleep. I've never forgiven myself for not trying to do more about it

Around the 1 year sober mark Jess felt strong in her recovery and decided she wanted to be able to prove to herself that she could have responsible amounts of alcohol at big events/gatherings. I told her I was really uncomfortable with it, but if it never became a an issue I'd be ok. To be clear, she has NEVER made me think she's off the wagon or anything like that and there have only been 2 or 3 times in the last year where she was legitimately drunk, but the frequency of her getting a few drinks with dinner or at smaller events has increased, particularly in the last couple months. To be fair, there have been some events recently, but I feel like the standard for what constitutes a reason to drink has gone away down(from a couple drinks on a 4 day trip to Vegas, to getting drunk at a co-workers cookout).

She says that me being worried is being controlling and making her feel like she's not allowed to make her own decisions about this. I don't want to make things that way, but I see SO many parallels to the situation with my friend and it'll crush me if that happens to her, I love her and can't handle seeing it, I'm trying to find a therapist to talk with it about, but I can't see how I can let this fear go. We just got in a flight about it and she said if I really can't stop feeling this way then maybe I should reevaluate if I want to be with her. She got mad and said she's just not going to drink around me anymore, which I said wouldn't help considering multiple times she has said if I tried to force her not to then it'd probably just make her want to do it even more and she'd just hide it from me, so now I just feel even worse

I understand a lot of where she's coming from in terms of wanting the freedom, and I really want to respect that, but I feel like this is playing with fire in a really dangerous way.  She's not doing anything at all that I'd consider problematic without her history of abuse, but baby steps lead back to that point. Would I be the ass hole for asking her to not drink?

29,1dsdhlx,AITA for not paying for my daughter's college housing and campus fees next year because she misled me about her summer classes?,"My (55M) daughter (19F) is taking three online summer classes this summer. Back in April, she told me that all her classes would be in-person, so I paid for her summer housing and meal plan so she could live on campus. I didn't think much of it at the time because I trusted her. Two of them are general education classes (English and physics), and one is a major-specific class, so I figured that she would want to get her generation requirements out of the way and I'm sure the major-specific class is important for her major.

However, I just found out that her classes are actually all online. There is a 3rd-party website that has information about classes each semester at her college, and I was just scrolling through it out of curiosity and happened to see her classes are all online, with no in-person component. I was very shocked about how I was misled for the last 2 or 3 months. I know that she really likes campus life, but things do tend to tone down over the summer, and she probably is aware of the campus housing fees and whatnot. This means I spent a good amount of money for housing and meal plans that she didn't actually need. I'm paying for her education out of her college savings, which we've been saving for many years, and I want to teach her the value of money and the importance of honesty.

I was on the phone with her, and I told her I decided that I'm not paying for her housing or any of her campus fees next year.

She says that in April the classes were listed as in-person but they moved it to virtual at the very last minute, after the deadline for housing withdrawal and refund stuff. I don't know if this is actually true since I never bothered to check the class listings at that time and I didn't see a reason she would lie about it. I told her I'm very skeptical that they would move all classes to online at the very last minute because it would certainly disrupt some people's plans (especially those who lease off-campus).

So it's been about 1 month and a couple weeks and I couldn't name how many times she canceled, but again I was expecting it.

I look at my phone to 7 missed calls from her and even a text from her boyfriend asking to reply to her. On top of that she texted me on social media apps asking me to reply. I appreciate having a friend that cares that much, but at the same time it makes me feel like I'm required to text back when she text me.

So I'm not even sure where to start on this, or if this is gunna be a waste of a post. But basically my friend and I made a plan to start going to the gym together. We mad an elaborate plan on when we could and couldn't go. One thing that was in the back of my mind after making this was that she would cancel consistently and I would just end up having to go by myself. Which isn't bad but it's nice to have a gym buddy if ya'll have a common goal.

33,1dsd1fy,AITA for not taking my elderly grandparents to my graduation? ,"We had 4 tickets which I used for my mother and 3 brothers.
My university is an ancient, traditional one, and the itenirary was really packed. I had planned the day out — there were lots of errands to do, eg picking up my robes, heading to a briefing and rehearsal, collecting tickets, all of which involved lots of walking. The city itself is ancient and many areas are pedestrianised. My grandparents would not have been able to walk so much. They are diabetic and have heart issues. There were no arrangements for people without tickets.
The graduation building and its surrounding area could only be entered by those with tickets. Those without had to wait outside, i.e. on the street. They were very strict with this - a friend of mine could not be brought inside for me to take a picture with them.
We visited my grandparents before we left (they were not happy and in the photos we took, were scowling), and we again visited them in the evening as soon as we returned.

This has now become a big drama. My grandparents are unhappy with us and don't want to talk to us now. Word has spread like wildfire and now relatives who are phoning to congratulate us are also asking us why we went ""alone"" (ie, without my grandparents). We have explained several times that lots of walking was involved and it would have been difficult for them to come with. For reference, we are South Asians living in Europe

34,1dscx02,AITA for excluding my friend at prom because she doesn’t want to underage drink?,"My (18F) school had our prom last Saturday. It’s technically an end of exams disco but everyone just calls it prom.

My country has a very big drinking culture. Most people in my class started drinking alcohol by the time they were 14. One of my friends (17F) is the daughter of two alcoholics, and she started getting drunk regularly when she was 12. Last year, she was in a car accident when her older sister was drunk driving. Her sister passed away, and she vowed to never drink again after that.

My friend made it clear that she was going to skip prom once she found out there was going to be a bar at the venue. However, the rest of us had been looking forward to prom for years and we didn’t want to miss out.

By the time prom came around, she started begging that we also skip prom as well. She asked that we all just hang out with her instead, so she wouldn’t feel lonely. I said there was no way. We were all so excited for this, and she expected us to miss out just to make her feel better?

She was upset with us for “excluding” her. The prom lasted until 1 am, and she was sad that we didn’t even text her during that time to make her feel less alone. I said we weren’t excluding her at all, she was choosing not to go. She claimed we weren’t being supportive of her and her trauma. I said she could just go and not drink, but she said even the presence of alcohol is too triggering. She said that being surrounded by drunk people would give her too much anxiety and remind her of her parents and her dead sister. She accused us of deliberately leaving her out because she didn't want to drink underage and put herself in a risky environment. I said she was acting childish and she couldn’t just expect the entire world to cater to her.

35,1dsctua,AITAH for being stressed about work?,"I (21f) got my first job at my local Walmart. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and it seems to get worse whenever all I wanna do is sleep all day. I’ve worked at this place for a week and I’m already so stressed out. My parents sheltered me from the real world my whole life until now. I don’t know how to deal with people in customer service, don’t know how to deal with them when they’re rude. Of course, I don’t lash out at them at work, I try to keep my composure, always smile and try to be nice regardless of the circumstances, but majority of my customers always make me smile. But, I also have very poor emotional regulation skills; my parents never taught me it’s ok to cry, be angry or sad. They never told me my feelings are valid. Quite the opposite. They told me that at the age of 21, I shouldn’t be crying about being stressed at work. I got home and was so upset, I screamed at my mom and sister to leave me alone. My sister told me I act victim 24/7, when it’s the complete opposite. I have a smile on my face that you couldn’t smack off if you tried so I’m generally a happy person. 

One day, my mom and I were playing with fake money to help me count change for work. I struggled a little, and my sister yelled at me telling me it wasn’t that hard. I confronted her about it and she said she was asleep, that she didn’t say it. But I know damn well she did. She never apologized for how she yelled at me but she forced me to apologize to her and my mom about my feelings about work/stress at home. I tried my best to talk to my mom and sister, but they both called me “an entitled brat/bitch” and I act victim 24/7”. All that anger I had built up inside from my customers at work, as well as the stress with my mom and sister all built up. So I lashed out at them both and began crying.

Here goes… My brother (m40) got married to his second wife when he was aged 35. He has always been a well-respected, jovial, high-earning gentleman. 
Like every other human being he had his faults and weaknesses. Two or three years into the marriage, we were told by his wife he’d be uncontactable as he was in rehab for ‘coke’ Addiction. As a family, we were gobsmacked as on our lives, I have never known him to indulge in drugs. Anyway, we stood by her and him as best we could. He relapsed a few months after coming out of rehab and needed to go back in. 
After another 3 month stint in rehab, 3 weeks out and I get a call from him that he was going to night club and I should join. He expressed that it wasn’t what he would like to do as he was still feeling vulnerable and not strong enough to resist the temptation however my SIL insisted that he had to be there. My SIL also reached out to me to join them, as we had a very good relationship. Because she had contacted me I asked her if it was in their best interest to go to the club when my brother was still fresh out of rehab. At this point she told me straight ‘that her lifestyle would not change to accommodate his and that as her husband it’s his duty to go with her and take her where she wanted to go’. They went anyway and now my brother is back in rehab. AITA for feeling like my SIL should have been more supportive?

41,1dsbt3s,AITA for insisting my five-year-old should be allowed to play in the pool when he’s done with swimming lessons for the day?,"We have a newly five-year-old and almost 3-year-old twins. They just had their first swim lesson Saturday at our pool (we can see it from our house). My husband suggested that we go swimming today. I got everything together and packed the wagon, and we headed to the pool.

When we got there, my husband told our five-year-old that he was going to be doing lessons again with him. Our five-year-old thought we were just going to the pool to play. Dad got in the water with our oldest and gave him instructions, which he followed all at least once. This included getting his face wet, putting his face underwater, kicking his legs off the side, doing monkey crawls, etc. There were some things he didn’t want to do at first, so he cried, but he still did them at least once. 

I was playing with our twins on the other side of the pool, and I noticed our oldest was sitting out of the water and looking sad. I asked my husband what was wrong, and he said our son didn’t want to learn anymore today. So I asked why isn’t he in the pool to play? He said our son won’t be playing in the pool anymore until he learns how to swim.

Now, our five-year-old plays in the pool without a floaty, stays on the stairs, can touch the bottom, but has to stay out of the deep end (we watch him, of course, to ensure his safety). He plays just fine in the pool and can have fun outside of learning how to swim. 

My husband is pissed off at me because when he told me our son was not allowed to swim anymore, I said that wasn’t fair. I told everyone to get out of the pool, got the twins out, packed up the wagon, and we went home. There was no yelling or arguing. I simply said “I disagree,” and, “I don’t think that’s fair.” He said he didn’t care, and all I care about is being right. Now, my husband can't stand to be in the same room with me, refuses to eat lunch with me, and wants nothing to do with me. He’s that angry.

This isn’t something we discussed beforehand. He just decided on his own that our five-year-old isn’t allowed to swim unless he’s taking lessons or has fully learned how to swim. I’m very confused because, at this point, I don’t see the point in going to the pool at all unless it’s for lessons. It just doesn’t sound like a fun way to spend the summer when we pay for a pool and have fun pool toys. When we were packing up, he sat there and told our son that his 60+ year-old grandmother never learned how to swim and is afraid of water now to justify his reasoning.

AITA for insisting my five-year-old should be allowed to play in the pool even if he's not actively taking swimming lessons? Now it has me thinking I’m just trying to be right, but to me it really doesn’t feel fair that our son is not allowed to play in the pool as a kid anymore while watching his brothers play. So idk!

He is also a life guard.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-30,"AITA for insisting my five-year-old should be allowed to play in the pool when he’s done with swimming lessons for the day? We have a newly five-year-old and almost 3-year-old twins. They just had their first swim lesson Saturday at our pool (we can see it from our house). My husband suggested that we go swimming today. I got everything together and packed the wagon, and we headed to the pool.

When we got there, my husband told our five-year-old that he was going to be doing lessons again with him. Our five-year-old thought we were just going to the pool to play. Dad got in the water with our oldest and gave him instructions, which he followed all at least once. This included getting his face wet, putting his face underwater, kicking his legs off the side, doing monkey crawls, etc. There were some things he didn’t want to do at first, so he cried, but he still did them at least once. 

I was playing with our twins on the other side of the pool, and I noticed our oldest was sitting out of the water and looking sad. I asked my husband what was wrong, and he said our son didn’t want to learn anymore today. So I asked why isn’t he in the pool to play? He said our son won’t be playing in the pool anymore until he learns how to swim.

Now, our five-year-old plays in the pool without a floaty, stays on the stairs, can touch the bottom, but has to stay out of the deep end (we watch him, of course, to ensure his safety). He plays just fine in the pool and can have fun outside of learning how to swim. 

My husband is pissed off at me because when he told me our son was not allowed to swim anymore, I said that wasn’t fair. I told everyone to get out of the pool, got the twins out, packed up the wagon, and we went home. There was no yelling or arguing.

43,1dsbowc,AITA Because I’m upset no one did much for my birthday?,"Sitting here thinking about typing this out, I feel like the biggest over dramatic idiot but I guess it’s better to get these emotions out than to keep feeling it. 

Today’s my 24th birthday and I’ve been in a weird mood all day. Yesterday was my brother’s baby shower for his first baby and my dad drove his family 13 hours to be here. They stayed at my apartment and I didn’t bring up or ask anything about my birthday since we’ve all been planning and thinking about this baby shower for a few months now and I didn’t want to make anything about me at all. 

This morning, at about 5AM, my dad and his family woke up and all made their way out of the door with a goodbye. I don’t know why but a part of me kept hoping that he’d at least have some small surprise or something just as a quick ‘happy birthday’ since I know they probably spent a lot of money and time on the baby shower. So, it hurt a little when they walked out of the door with nothing else to say. He texted me a few hours later with a ‘happy birthday’ message and that was it. 

My best friend also hasn’t said much besides a quick happy birthday message too. Her birthday was a month ago and we went on a trip out of town to celebrate. We didn’t do much of extravagance but I don’t know. We made those plans months in advance and now that it’s my birthday, everyone’s only asking on the day of. No plans made. Not even a knock on the door to visit me in person. 

One of my other friends made plans with me for a chill evening of watching a movie and going to get Chinese food. I’m grateful for that. I think if I didn’t have those plans, I’d be devastated. 

But am I being needy? Am I putting expectations on people and letting myself down? I just want to be something worth planning for. I want to be celebrated too, you know? Maybe it’s just bad timing with the baby shower and everything else but I can’t help but feel like I’m the spare kid, the spare friend. I can’t get the thought out of my head that I’m unimportant and alone on a day like this.

He'd asked me to bring it, so that he could try it out and see if he'd like one for his birthday. When I got it back, the controller was broken. 

I raised the issue with my dad afterwards, and asked if he could replace it. He was evasive and refused to do so, stating that he had no idea who broke the controller, and I should replace it myself. This isn't out of character for him, as he is a hyper disagreeable person who hates being asked to do things. If I push the issue, I can tell he will continue to refuse, and likely just become more upset and angry. I've made my peace with this facet of his personality over the years. 

Since then, my dad bought my brother a switch, with all the accessories, and a spare set of controllers.

So, there's this friend that I made at work and it was someone who I clearly tried to keep as a work colleague only. We had a lot in common so we would talk often which was fine but recently they keep trying to hang out in person which im just not comfortable with and I've tried to make it obvious in a roundabout way because they are kind of a sensitive person. They always say ""of I do something you don't like just let me know"" but then when I do they get all ""it's my fault im sorry I can't do anything right etc"" and it makes me feel bad for saying it so I try and compromise but recently it's been getting worse.

And I understand that I need to be more firm but it's hard because they are friends with my parents and they are on their side so if I'm 'mean' they are on the work colleagues side.

Back in 2020 my sister had an idea. She was going to publish songs under a fake child music artist, by using our younger cousin's likeness (who at that time was only 5). From what she told me she got the idea while making songs about the video game Roblox with her online friends and they thought it would be funny to publish them as if they were being sung by an actual child since Roblox is a game primarily used by children. Originally she was just going to pitch her voice up and only release one song on YouTube. But this little joke quickly ballooned into a full rap album. And she was very insistent on having this seem as realistic as possible.
So she decided to put our little cousin on the album cover to make it seem like she was the one singing it. She used a fake name but still used pictures of our cousin in the album art. She also never got permission from our aunt (the mother of the cousin) for any of this. She told me all of this and at the time I even helped her with designing some of the album art. I didn't think much of it because I thought that the music was only going to be confined to her friend group and wasn't going to get any reach elsewhere. She posted the album on Spotify and YouTube under a fake name, with her sped up vocals, but the album cover had real pictures of our little cousin.
A couple of months had passed and I started to get multiple messages from my sister saying that the album had ""gone viral"". At first I felt excited that this happened but it soon quickly turned into dread because the aunt may now learn about this. When I looked back at the YouTube and Spotify channels the songs were getting more than a hundred thousand streams/views so not mega viral but still viral.
My sister then wanted to release more albums to ride off this success and ended up releasing two more. At the end of 2021 she finally stopped apparently she had a falling out with her original friend group where this joke was created.
Flash forward to now, the little cousin is now 9. My aunt said that she is going to run an instagram account for the cousin so that she can follow her friends and post photos. Now I am starting to have an anxiety attack because pictures of our cousin may now be identified as the child artist who went semi-viral 4 years ago. And if our aunt finds out we're both toast.
I talked to my sister about this and she says people have forgotten all about that. I said that she needs to come clean about this now, because I don't want to be caught up in a web of lies when the aunt eventually finds out.

Also sorry if my English isn't good, it's not my first language.
So a bit of background for this story is that me and my best friend (both 19f), let's call her Sara, are in college and have spent almost all day together, sometimes have a couple of friends with us but again still together. 
Over the last month she has gotten a boyfriend, whom we have known for about 3 months and they spend all day together and I barely met them during this one month. Not to say that we haven't spent any time together but only meet for like 15-20 minutes.

Let's call my other friend Madison, we both started spending most of our time together and a few times that Sara has called me to hang out, I had already made plans to hang out with Madison and a few other friends. 

This incident starts with me and Madison hanging out at my dorm together when Sara texts me, asking to hangout. I obviously tell her to join me at my dorm, she comes to my dorm and gets annoyed when she sees Madison in my dorm and asks me if we can talk privately. We both find a place to sit when Sara asks me why I can't find the time to meet her and why I am always hanging out with Madison. I told her that I can't keep waiting around for her to find some time for me and that I also need to find someone to hangout with throughout the day. 
She gets annoyed with me saying that she isn't always busy but it's clear that she prefers hanging out with him. Whenever she had a problem, she came to me and never him but recently things started changing and I'm okay with that but I can't keep my life on the pause for her. I will obviously be there for her if she has a problem but I can't also wait till she decides to hangout with me.

So a bit of background for this story is that me and my best friend (both 19f), let's call her Sara, are in college and have spent almost all day together, sometimes have a couple of friends with us but again still together. 
Over the last month she has gotten a boyfriend, whom we have known for about 3 months and they spend all day together and I barely met them during this one month. Not to say that we haven't spent any time together but only meet for like 15-20 minutes.

50,1dsawr0,AITA for threatening to reduce my friends role in a project if he cant commit to it,"me and my friend are making a fictional country. The focus was making a language, but it bloomed from that. We both made the concept for the language, and started making words. We wanted efficiency, so before a 1 week school break, we agreed I would do culture, he would make the initial writing system. I finished the  culture in that time, and I wrote the whole history of the country, , and he hadn't done a thing. 

He made many excuses, such as he had no time, he had to do other things etc. I encouraged him to make some characters, and he made some. I checked in every few days or so, and he made every excuse ever about not making characters. Eventually he promised he would make some more and he did. Afterwards I asked him about how it was going, and he said he restarted the whole thing because he wanted to improve the characters. There are 6 writing systems, his job was the first one, but in this encounter offered to do the first 2 and half of the third one, which I  agreed to, because I thought it meant he would commit, but he didn't. 

His excuses were getting so silly it was like he thought i was stupid. I'm with him on the school bus an hour+ a day, and he refuses to do it then. He is one of the most active members of a group chat for our class I'm in, and he always asks everyone to do a group call; he has plenty of free time. I have been with him many times where he is doing nothing productive for over an hour. He says he is being productive but he isn't. 

I started reminding him daily to make characters and giving him a list, which worked, but I found out then characters took him seconds to make, it wasn't complex calligraphy. This was where I started to lose my patience. I stopped  the daily reminders over the weekend, as I felt it was his job to do them alone, and how shocking, no new characters as of late Sunday. 

I got a bit annoyed at him via text, I was keeping calm while still letting him know I was angry, so no insults, but a kind of, ""Seriously!"" Tone, and I told him if he cant commit I would reduce his part in it. He said something like ""fine, kick me out"". I told him im not doing that, but would reduce his job to a lesser amount, and he said he cba to do anything anymore. So I asked why he wasted my time for 2 months with lies and I said how he could have just given himself a workload he was able to do, not in a rude way,but a way where I was communicating my concern and how I was annoyed he didn't say it from the start and tried to appease me by giving himself more work. His responses were passive aggressive and he started ignoring Me after a bit. AITA?

Me(47m) & my father(75m) have had a difficult relationship my entire life. In the last 2 years, we'd been talking more frequently openly. I'm in LA now & he's in AZ. I'd drive over on weekends to help him around the house. He'd been telling me he doesn't have people in his life or any help. All past history aside, I felt a duty to help him & wanted to build a relationship. Last year I drove 15x 900 mile round trips to help & visit him. Recently he & I through the family trust purchased an investment home. Our plan was for me to do the repairs which didn't require permits, paint, & install new carpet. Though in May I had an injury & need to have knee surgery in July. So we decided to hire contractors.

Last Weds he was supposedly working on the new house & fell off the roof. Luckily minor injuries of some broken ribs & a collar bone. Best case scenario. Though Friday night he crashed, came back, and is stable now. Very unexpected.

In a panic, Friday night I packed up the car to head to AZ. Thinking he has no one to help him or be there. Then remembered I have to be in Oregon for Dr appts this week & back in LA for knee surgery next week. So I packed for both places & prepared to drive 3200 miles in the next 10 days.

Saturday while I was getting ready to leave. I got a call from a woman claiming to be my dad's GF(70f) for the last 7yrs. I was skeptical at first since my dad has been stating he's been single for almost 10yrs. Her & I talked for about 30min. It turns out she is his GF of 7yrs & he has a secret family. She was very kind & we had a good conversation & filled in many ""blanks"" for each other.
He hasn't told a single person in my family about her. While lying to her that we all know about her. I don't know why after 7yrs she didn't think it was strange to have not met any of us. Though that's her conversation with my dad. As well as I found out that ""investment"" house is for them to live in & I was expected to fix it up for them. He used $54k of my trust/savings for the down-payment.

Here's AITA, I'm feeling very conflicted right now. He is my father & in the hospital. Much of me wants to put off my medical issues & rush to his side. Another part of me feels so betrayed & manipulated again. That part is telling me to take care of my knee & my medical issues.

We had two separate sets of keys \[building, flat, and mailbox\]. She said she wanted to keep her key fob to the building and our mailbox key, since she was going to stay with a friend and it would be easier to get into her place that way and needed to check the mail. I was OK with this, as it was a mostly amicable breakup. She returned the key to our specific flat.

Then yesterday, a week after our breakup, I saw she was with another guy from our apartment building, so I asked her to return the other keys immediately. She refused to return the keys and insisted she was staying with her female friend and to please keep the break up civil. I told her she was not, and she said she doesn't know what I believe but she's told me the truth.

I sent a photo I took of her and the other guy on our terrace feeling each other up, and she said nothing happened during our relationship, and they didn't pursue each other, and they simply went out for drinks and connected really well. She told me if I wasn't so unkind to her during our relationship, she would not have emotionally checked out and found someone new so quickly. She insisted they are not pursuing a relationship. When we split, she originally said she was unhappy in our relationship, as she wanted to spend more time doing things together, whilst I wanted to stay home more often, and we had different interest and she saw they were not going to line up any time soon.

She then said she will not return the keys until she is ready and on her feet, and she is not staying with the guy, so I told our leasing office that she moved out and potentially moved in with another guy or girl in the building, and they said they will reach out and find out what's going on since she cannot move in with them as shes not on their lease.

I let her know that I let the leasing company know this, and she said I'm unkind, my behavior is atrocious, and I'm being cruel to her.

He cheated on his ex wife and the affair was discovered when his current wife was pregnant with their second child together (he also had a 20 month old at the time the affair was discovered). AJ, CJ and Alice were still minors at the time so shared custody was set up and they spent an equal amount of time with my brother and with their mom. The kids hated this. They were clear from the moment the affair came to light that they would never accept my brother's other children or his current wife. All three went no contact with my brother upon their 18th birthdays and refused all contact.

AJ became ill last year and he passed away 7 months ago. My brother was not told. AJ passed before he learned this. I knew and so did my younger brother because we were close to our nephews and niece and we're still close to our former SIL who was always like a sister to us. Losing AJ was one of the hardest things. He had so much life ahead of him and he was about to become a dad, something my brother was also unaware of.

AJ had prepared for his passing. He had written up a will. Most of everything he had went to his son, who was born 6 weeks after he died. But he shared personal possessions with his siblings (CJ and Alice) and his mom. He made it very clear in his will he was not leaving anything to my brother or my brother's other children.

My brother was upset that he was kept in the dark about AJs illness. Even more so when he found out AJ was expecting a child with his girlfriend and then more when AJ planned a very private funeral so my brother and his family could not attend. When it came to light AJ left nothing to my brother or the younger children my brother became more distraught. He asked CJ and Alice he reached out and asked them if he could have some of AJs trinkets that he always kept, something he could pass to the other kids. They said no way in hell.

This is when my brother tried to involve me. He told me to think of my younger niece and nephew and asked me to convince CJ and Alice to let them have something of AJs. I told him no. He said I needed to do something because they needed something to remember AJ by. He told me to do whatever it takes. I told him I won't bully his kids for him. He said I was exaggerating and he never even suggested that.

He cheated on his ex wife and the affair was discovered when his current wife was pregnant with their second child together (he also had a 20 month old at the time the affair was discovered). AJ, CJ and Alice were still minors at the time so shared custody was set up and they spent an equal amount of time with my brother and with their mom. The kids hated this. They were clear from the moment the affair came to light that they would never accept my brother's other children or his current wife. All three went no contact with my brother upon their 18th birthdays and refused all contact.

AJ became ill last year and he passed away 7 months ago. My brother was not told. AJ passed before he learned this. I knew and so did my younger brother because we were close to our nephews and niece and we're still close to our former SIL who was always like a sister to us. Losing AJ was one of the hardest things. He had so much life ahead of him and he was about to become a dad, something my brother was also unaware of.

AJ had prepared for his passing. He had written up a will. Most of everything he had went to his son, who was born 6 weeks after he died. But he shared personal possessions with his siblings (CJ and Alice) and his mom. He made it very clear in his will he was not leaving anything to my brother or my brother's other children.

My brother was upset that he was kept in the dark about AJs illness. Even more so when he found out AJ was expecting a child with his girlfriend and then more when AJ planned a very private funeral so my brother and his family could not attend. When it came to light AJ left nothing to my brother or the younger children my brother became more distraught. He asked CJ and Alice he reached out and asked them if he could have some of AJs trinkets that he always kept, something he could pass to the other kids. They said no way in hell.

This is when my brother tried to involve me. He told me to think of my younger niece and nephew and asked me to convince CJ and Alice to let them have something of AJs. I told him no. He said I needed to do something because they needed something to remember AJ by. He told me to do whatever it takes. I told him I won't bully his kids for him. He said I was exaggerating and he never even suggested that.

60,1ds9p3p,AITA for telling my neighbors to shut up ,"Honestly, pretty straightforward.

Woke up in the middle of the fucking night at 12 AM, to the sound of a baby crying in my apartment hallway. It was fine at first I get it, babies cry and throw tantrums, shit is hard parenting is hard. BUT BRO THE KID WONT STOP CRYING.

Me and my husband woke up, I thought to myself “aight fuck it imma tell my neighbor to keep it down”. Went up to them, and then I saw the baby ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALLWAY, CRYING. Mind you, again, this is like 12 am in the middle of the fucking night. Who puts their crying baby on the floor of the apartment hallway???!!!

So I said to them “hey can you keep it down.” NICELY. Didn’t yell at them, at all. My neighbor straight up and said “ITS A BABY HOW IS IT SUPPOSE TO DO THAT?”. Ok, rude.

Then the girl straight up called me racist. My neighbor is Indian, and I live in Dubai. Despite Indians being the majority of the population, they do get a lot of bad rep (which I understand, I’m southeast asian and southeast asians also get a lot of bad rep here in dubai too. Like we’re on the same boat here). BUT HOW IS IT RACIST TO WANT THE BABY TO SHUT UP BRO. I just wanna sleep istg

So simply:
1. Crying baby, at 12 AM midnight
2. Baby is crying on the FLOOR of the apartment hallway.
3. I asked them nicely to just keep it down, maybe put the baby inside the apartment instead of idk CRYING ON THE HALLWAY FLOOR??
4. They yelled at me back and I get called racist. 

Update:

They called me inconsiderate and racist. Deadass “YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE KIDS”, exactly, which is why I chose to not have kids yet lol??

61,1ds9koo,AITA for gambling my BF’s money?,"I need help seeing a situation clearly. 
Last night, I was out with my boyfriend. We had rented a hotel for the evening at a casino. After dinner, we decided to do some gambling. I had never played before and was really nervous. Money has been tight for me, so I don’t just have cash to spend. I said this, but my BF said I should, that he didn’t want to, and that we should have some fun. So he gave me some cash to play. As I was stepping up to the table, my bf asked me for my bag so I didn’t have to hold it while playing. I handed it over to him and turned an awkwardly told the dealer I’d like to play and tried to hand him the money…which if you have ever gambled you know you’re not supposed to do. The dealer looked at me funny and asked for my ID of course. I’m well over 21….but I was so frazzled and nervous I could feel myself shaking. I reached behind me to get my bag from my bf. As the guy is looking at my id, my bf again asks if he can take my bag and I hand it back to him. Before I start playing, my bf leans in and say “what’s with all the weird faces” and I replied “what weird faces? I was just ok holding my bag?” He then said “ok, then I’m gonna go” and handed me my bag and walked away. 

I sat and played a few hands before getting up to go find him, figuring he was upset and needed a moment to calm down. I also was gambling his money and had wanted to make sure I won something before getting up. I’d win some, lose some but I waited till I was up about $50 and left the table. So I went back up to our room because my bag had the room key in it. I texted and said that I was back in the room and had left the door slightly open. He texted me saying he was furious, that was I was extremely disrespectful considering I was gambling his money and he’d paid for the hotel room. I apologized and tried to explain I wasn’t intentionally making faces at him. He claimed I was making him look and feel like a chauvinistic pig. But from my perspective, I was so panicked and frazzled about the gambling I wasn’t paying attention to anything like that. He came back to our hotel room, got his things, and left. I tried to apologize again, but he said “he would not be manipulated” and that what I did was “beyond disrespectful.” 

He eventually came back to our room because the hotel didn’t have any other rooms available. So he slept on the couch…without a blanket or anything. I tried to apologize again in the morning but was met with the same resistance and anger. He says I’m playing the victim card and martyring myself. That I’m not understanding my wrongdoing and not acknowledging my own fault in the situation. I felt like I did.I apologized when he came back to the room and I tried to apologize and talk in the morning.

I raised my voice and said “You can’t say that that is seriously not okay and not funny.” My dad told me to stop but I said “no you guys are being racist” 

Anyway I felt uncomfortable and went downstairs. a couple minutes later my dad came down and talked to me. He said that i was overreacting and i was going to run into a lot worse racism in my life, and i couldn’t always freak out like that. i told him that i already had and that kids at my school can be pretty racist and say the n-word as well. then he asked me if it was in a “what’s up my n****r way or a duragatory way” I told him that he and my mom were both in the wrong and i wasn’t going to support them acting like this. he got mad and said that he and my mom were both not racist and it’s not like it was directed towards any black person and she was quoting someone. i said it was still wrong because she was mocking the black rapper almost.

63,1ds9heh,AITA for asking for my FIL's opinion,"My husband (35M) and I (40F)need to redo our hardwood kitchen floor. We both dislike hardwood in kitchens, and he also dislikes tile and wants linoleum. I have been looking into flooring options to put over the hardwood that is water-resistant but won't ruin the wood underneath. 

My husband was talking to his dad on the phone. My FIL is one of the smartest men I know, and while he doesn't have flooring expertise, he is really good with household projects and knows a lot of things, I asked my husband (twice) to get his dad's opinion. Finally, I wrote on a piece of paper ""I want to ask your dad if he knows of a flooring option water-resistant but won't ruin the hardwood underneath"" and gave it to him. He then talked to his dad about how we are redoing the floors and he doesn't want to put in tile but rather linoleum. His dad agreed he didn't like tile.

After he got off the phone, I asked him why he didn't ask the question. He said he did, although they only talked about disliking tile. He then said he didn't ask because I just want other people's opinion to pressure him to agree to tile when he wants linoleum. I told him that he keeps saying he wants linoleum, but I think he is using that term as a catch-all for linoleum, vinyl, LVP, and laminate. Some of them have different options to installation- glue vs. floating. I specifically wanted to know what his dad thinks is the best.

He told me I didn't explain that all to him, but even if I had, he didn't want to ask his dad because his dad doesn't know anything about flooring. At this point he is getting mad at me, saying we just need to ask the flooring store when we go to buy it. I said that was naive- the people in the flooring store are trying to sell to us, so we need to be cautious of anything they say and do our research before had.

My husband then confidently started telling me that gluing on hardwood wouldn't ruin it because you just need to re-sand it and the glue will all come off. I got really frustrated because up until one minute ago he didn't even know about gluing flooring so how the heck can he know?! I tried to get the conversation back on track and asked if there was anyone he would be comfortable asking who's opinion he would listen to. He said someone who have refinished a floor that had glue on it, and he know that is not his dad, so that is why he didn't ask.

I pointed out he has given me 4 different answers as to why he didn't ask his dad and the fact that he was trying to mansplain flooring. He told me it must be sooooo hard to be married to such a sexist person that is so mean to me all the time. I took a deep breath and went for a long walk.

I tried to get the conversation back on track and asked if there was anyone he would be comfortable asking who's opinion he would listen to. He said someone who have refinished a floor that had glue on it, and he know that is not his dad, so that is why he didn't ask.

I pointed out he has given me 4 different answers as to why he didn't ask his dad and the fact that he was trying to mansplain flooring. He told me it must be sooooo hard to be married to such a sexist person that is so mean to me all the time. I took a deep breath and went for a long walk.

Am I the asshole for wanting to ask his dad about flooring? For wanting to research flooring options and learn before we make a big purchase? For saying my husband was mansplaining flooring?",0.0,0.9147872924804688,1,0
64,1ds9bua,AITA for wanting my cousin to give me our dead grandfather's guitar? ,"I (16F) have been learning to play the guitar for over a year and a half now, using my friend's old guitar. I'm learning by myself, since I can't afford to pay a teacher, but I'm not bad at it and even have written a couple of songs.

Recently i found out my cousin (16F too) has my grandfather's old guitar, which i thought was lost or sold. My cousin is a violinist and studies at the conservatory, and has had this guitar for three years. She uses it casually since her main focus are the violin and the piano. I use mine everyday, and i decided to text her and ask her to give it to me, because my friend will eventually want his guitar back and if you think about it, the guitar is as hers as it is mine. 

The thing is, she got mad because she says she needs it for her studies and it's ""more important than me because I'm not studying music"". The guitar has one string broken (she broke it accidentally) and it's pretty old, so i think it'd make sense that she bought herself one if she is taking it seriously. I would really like to have it because i loved my grandad and it holds emotional value to me + i wouldn't need to worry to return it to anybody (I'd repair the broken string ofc).

My parents don't care at all about this and say it's not a big deal and i should let her keep it because she is actually studying music, and her and her parents called me selfish for wanting to keep it and said she has more rights than me for this same reason. I honestly don't know what to do and I'm confused if they're actually right. What do you think? ",Asshole,2024-06-30,"AITA for wanting my cousin to give me our dead grandfather's guitar?

I had no significant other or friends who were able to live with me when I was looking for a roommate. l asked my aunt who works under the table if she'd want to roommate with me to help me out with expenses and also give her a better place to live because she wasn't in a great spot herself. Since she works under the table, she has no proof of income, she also has an eviction in her name from a place she had rented from before with another family member. Due to those reasons, I put the whole place and utilities in my name.
Since moving in, I have met an amazing partner who is also staying with us, he doesn't have a room, he sleeps with me in my room. He pays the electric/gas, and internet since he stays with us now.
My aunt did not have a bed when we moved in so my boyfriend got her a frame, so all she'd have to do is get a mattress (which she still hasn't and it's been almost 2 months) which causes her to sleep in our living room on the couch everyday.
She has decorated every room in the house, when I told her she could just do the kitchen and our tastes are drastically different because her decor is extremely tacky. I just feel like if everything is in my name I should have primary
say on what looks good (but she is paying half rent so idk if that would be right to say) We are on month two of our lease and she is late on her rent, and now has to pay a tee because I had my half ready so I'm not paying the fee. I just feel like this is going to be a constant cycle, I am in the process of fixing my credit and I don't want anything affecting it or to get evicted. Eventually I want to move out with my partner and have a life with him but as of right now it's complicated. I just feel bad because I did ask her to move in with me, she has no where else to go now, but her being late on month two is concerning. She always asks for money back out of money she's given me towards rent for whatever she uses it for and even without giving her some of the money she still didn't give me her full half.
Pros of her being there, she buys groceries and cleans.

69,1ds8rvw,AITA for wanting to leave my husband who is working 12 hours per day to pay my tuition fees.,"This might be a long one but I feel it’s important to know the backstory. So, me and my husband met when I was fresh out of college and a year later we started to have this casual relationship- a friends with benefit kinda thing. However, 8 months into this relationship, I ended up pregnant. I had always wanted a baby and I decided to keep it even if my friend decides he wants nothing to do with it. Luckily he seemed very excited and said I could do whatever I wanted and that he would be there to support me. He even suggested making this relationship real and introducing each other to our family since he wants to be married to me and spend his life with me. We decide to do this. At this time, I had already started working and was living in my own apartment in the building that my dad owned. (In our culture we don’t really move out when we turn 18 and our parents support us financially as long as they can). My husband at that time had no job and ran a bar that had literally zero income because it was just an empty place for all of our friends to gather. He stayed with me most of the time whenever he came to my city and moved in permanently after the pregnancy. Our families were cool with it and decided to give us their blessing. So during this whole pregnancy, i was working, I paid the bills and I paid for everything. I was okay with this, and I always said “if I am being treated the right way and the way I wanted to be treated, I don’t mind being the breadwinner “ and my husband was very good to me. However, my brother suggested opening up a restaurant to help my husband stand on his feet, where we wouldn’t have to pay any investment money for the set up, if we had profit, it would be divided equally and for atleast a year, if it was running in losses, we wouldn’t have to bear with it. The key was my husband had to be the manager for it. Everything was going so good and I was so happy that I was already lucky with a generous family who treated me like their princess and even got luckier with a husband who treated me the same as my family.

HOWEVER, after giving birth everything changed. My husband started to get moody and mood off all the time. It started the night of my daughter’s birth. Where it was just the 2 of us in the hospital due to Covid lockdown. His mood went off and stopped talking to me just because I shouted “COME FAST! I NEED TO GO TO THE TOILET”, it was right after I gave birth to this big ass baby and had multiple tears in my vagina which nearly reached my anus, so my everything downstairs was f**ked up. He said “I disrespect him all the time” and stopped talking to me. I didn’t think this would be the start of my crying journey. Postpartum was hard, I breastfed my daughter 100% and that shit is hard with my nipple all cracked and no sleep. My husband would be sleeping so peacefully right next to me and every night I would wake him up asking him to stay up with me sometimes cuz it would help me so much emotionally. I would understand if he had work the next day but he didn’t and he didn’t have to do any of the housework cuz I had my cousins who came to help me with that. But every night he would be sleeping so peacefully. During the day, he would mostly be on his phone playing games. When we were friends, we used to gather up with a lot of our friends and play poker for fun and our friends continued that. I stopped going to those gathering after I gave birth. My husband kept going to these gatherings. And when I asked him not to and to help me around the house with the baby, he would get mad and completely shutdown. 2 months postpartum, when I wasn’t even completely healed, I was at home with my baby and my husband said his friend asked him to help them shift their house and I was like “okay, I’ll see you when you get back” I was home alone and getting my daughter ready for a bath. When one of our friends dropped by and I guess he felt really sad when he saw me, he just blurted out “your husband isn’t helping move the house but playing poker at so and so’s house,  he has been doing that a lot recently, all the friend group has been telling him not to come but he refuses to listen” that’s when it clicked, all the time he said he was going somewhere he had lied to me.this friend was a highschool classmate of mine but was friends with my husband longer. My heart was broken, we had our fights but I trusted him. Now the trust was gone. Oh I forgot to tell you, he left that business with my brother because he said “it is just suppressing my goals and dreams” and I was supportive of that as well. So I confronted him and he wasn’t apologetic, he was just like “I lied because you get angry when I am honest with you” so I said get out of this room, I don’t want to see your face for now, and I can’t fall asleep when you are next to me cuz I start getting this palpitations and anxiety (I wasn’t sleeping much anyway). He left the room, went to the room next door and proceeded to ignore me for the next 7 days. I gave him multiple chances and asked him if he really had nothing to say to me but he outright ignored me, just going around to his friends houses and sleeping in the room next door. This was the last straw. I decided I don’t want to be with him. I told him to get out of the house and that I will be a serrving him with divorce papers soon. He left the house but three days after the fight at night time he comes back begging me to forgive him - I don’t. He comes back again the next day during night time, I say no. All this time my head is full of him, day and night thinking what’s going to happen now. Since we have the same circle of friends, I called around asking what he was doing during the day, since he only came back at night begging me to forgive him and I found out he was just going around with his friends , sometimes playing snooker. This booked my blood. But anyway I guess my heart ain’t that hard cuz I forgave him. We go like this for another few months, he acts like he has changed for a few days but goes back to the same shit again until I start bawling my eyes out and then he becomes this good husband for another few days and I felt like I was stuck in this vicious cycle. But after thinking hard I decided I should stop this cuz it wasn’t good for my mental health and went seperate ways with him. He came to see his daughter as much as he could when I was either at work or sometimes when I was home as well.. he loved his daughter.

 I decided I want to study more and do my masters in Australia and my father said he could help me financially. My husband came running back to me asking me if he could go with me since our divorce hasn’ gone through yet and that he won’t be able to stay without seeing his daughter, I refused. Then he went to my brother, almost at the verge of crying asking to please send him along as well. He promised he would help me pay 70% of the tuition fees (many people did this in our country- strangers getting a marriage certificate so that they could go to Australia together and the dependent would pay a certain amount of the tuition fees which was mostly 70/30). My brother loves my daughter, so he encouraged me to try giving him a chance, no need to stay together but that my daughter could atleast see her father whenever she wanted to. He promised 70% of the first semester as well, but at the very end he said he couldn’t get the money . So my father gave the 100% of the first semester and I decided it was best if we made an agreement saying “my husband borrowed the amount he would have to pay for my tuition fees from my father and whenever he does pay it each semester, I would give him a receipt saying he has paid back this amount but if he doesn’t pay the 70% of my fees, his property (a land that he has in the countryside) would go to my father. With this agreement we came to Australia. And after reaching here, my husband paid the fees diligently, he even tried multiple times to get back with me. And my stupid weak heart accepted him. We moved in together, he suggested he will pay 100% of the fees, since I had my working restrictions as a student and that I pay for the house rent, bills and home expenses. 

Now the current situation - my husband does full time Uber and drives for 12 hours per day. I work 24 hours per week since that is what I am allowed to do and also I need to be home with my daughter in the morning and afternoon I drop her to my cousins house when I go for my work. My husband comes home, sleeps immediately, wakes up early and go drive again. And when he is at home and I try to strike up conversation about how things are going, it’s always half hearted and most of the time he is not in a good mood. I understand he must be tired but I feel like I am walking on eggshells all the time, always worried about pissing him off or always doing things hoping it would make him happy. The only time he is all jolly and happy and talking is when he wants sex. When I communicate about how I am feeling, he either dismisses me or says I create this all in my head. We are literally like housemates, where we don’t talk to each other, even when we are sitting right next to each other. And I have noticed that any time he seems interested in my talks or he is talking a lot and happy and jolly- that night he would try to get in my pants. It’s been few months now that we have not done the deed because I don’t want to. I get the feeling of I’m getting used just for sex. Mind you - I am someone who loves sex. But I feel disgusted when I think about doing it with him. I don’t enjoy kissing him as well. And now everytime he is nice to me - I start getting anxious because I will have to go through that process of telling him “no” for sex and him getting mood off again. My cousins tell me to give him a break and that he is a good man because “atleast he is working his ass off to pay my fees”. But I calculated, him paying 100% of my fees is the same as him paying 70% of the fees because he had to pay for his rent and stuff before. But now he moved in with me, so he doesn’t need to pay the other expenses.

My husband would be sleeping so peacefully right next to me and every night I would wake him up asking him to stay up with me sometimes cuz it would help me so much emotionally. I would understand if he had work the next day but he didn’t and he didn’t have to do any of the housework cuz I had my cousins who came to help me with that. But every night he would be sleeping so peacefully. During the day, he would mostly be on his phone playing games. When we were friends, we used to gather up with a lot of our friends and play poker for fun and our friends continued that. I stopped going to those gathering after I gave birth. My husband kept going to these gatherings. And when I asked him not to and to help me around the house with the baby, he would get mad and completely shutdown. 2 months postpartum, when I wasn’t even completely healed, I was at home with my baby and my husband said his friend asked him to help them shift their house and I was like “okay, I’ll see you when you get back” I was home alone and getting my daughter ready for a bath. When one of our friends dropped by and I guess he felt really sad when he saw me, he just blurted out “your husband isn’t helping move the house but playing poker at so and so’s house,  he has been doing that a lot recently, all the friend group has been telling him not to come but he refuses to listen” that’s when it clicked, all the time he said he was going somewhere he had lied to me.this friend was a highschool classmate of mine but was friends with my husband longer. My heart was broken, we had our fights but I trusted him. Now the trust was gone. Oh I forgot to tell you, he left that business with my brother because he said “it is just suppressing my goals and dreams” and I was supportive of that as well. So I confronted him and he wasn’t apologetic, he was just like “I lied because you get angry when I am honest with you” so I said get out of this room, I don’t want to see your face for now, and I can’t fall asleep when you are next to me cuz I start getting this palpitations and anxiety (I wasn’t sleeping much anyway). He left the room, went to the room next door and proceeded to ignore me for the next 7 days. I gave him multiple chances and asked him if he really had nothing to say to me but he outright ignored me, just going around to his friends houses and sleeping in the room next door. This was the last straw. I decided I don’t want to be with him. I told him to get out of the house and that I will be a serrving him with divorce papers soon. He left the house but three days after the fight at night time he comes back begging me to forgive him - I don’t. He comes back again the next day during night time, I say no. All this time my head is full of him, day and night thinking what’s going to happen now. Since we have the same circle of friends, I called around asking what he was doing during the day, since he only came back at night begging me to forgive him and I found out he was just going around with his friends , sometimes playing snooker. This booked my blood. But anyway I guess my heart ain’t that hard cuz I forgave him. We go like this for another few months, he acts like he has changed for a few days but goes back to the same shit again until I start bawling my eyes out and then he becomes this good husband for another few days and I felt like I was stuck in this vicious cycle. But after thinking hard I decided I should stop this cuz it wasn’t good for my mental health and went seperate ways with him. He came to see his daughter as much as he could when I was either at work or sometimes when I was home as well.. he loved his daughter.

 I decided I want to study more and do my masters in Australia and my father said he could help me financially. My husband came running back to me asking me if he could go with me since our divorce hasn’ gone through yet and that he won’t be able to stay without seeing his daughter, I refused. Then he went to my brother, almost at the verge of crying asking to please send him along as well. He promised he would help me pay 70% of the tuition fees (many people did this in our country- strangers getting a marriage certificate so that they could go to Australia together and the dependent would pay a certain amount of the tuition fees which was mostly 70/30). My brother loves my daughter, so he encouraged me to try giving him a chance, no need to stay together but that my daughter could atleast see her father whenever she wanted to. He promised 70% of the first semester as well, but at the very end he said he couldn’t get the money . So my father gave the 100% of the first semester and I decided it was best if we made an agreement saying “my husband borrowed the amount he would have to pay for my tuition fees from my father and whenever he does pay it each semester, I would give him a receipt saying he has paid back this amount but if he doesn’t pay the 70% of my fees, his property (a land that he has in the countryside) would go to my father. With this agreement we came to Australia. And after reaching here, my husband paid the fees diligently, he even tried multiple times to get back with me. And my stupid weak heart accepted him. We moved in together, he suggested he will pay 100% of the fees, since I had my working restrictions as a student and that I pay for the house rent, bills and home expenses. 

Now the current situation - my husband does full time Uber and drives for 12 hours per day. I work 24 hours per week since that is what I am allowed to do and also I need to be home with my daughter in the morning and afternoon I drop her to my cousins house when I go for my work. My husband comes home, sleeps immediately, wakes up early and go drive again. And when he is at home and I try to strike up conversation about how things are going, it’s always half hearted and most of the time he is not in a good mood. I understand he must be tired but I feel like I am walking on eggshells all the time, always worried about pissing him off or always doing things hoping it would make him happy. The only time he is all jolly and happy and talking is when he wants sex. When I communicate about how I am feeling, he either dismisses me or says I create this all in my head. We are literally like housemates, where we don’t talk to each other, even when we are sitting right next to each other. And I have noticed that any time he seems interested in my talks or he is talking a lot and happy and jolly- that night he would try to get in my pants. It’s been few months now that we have not done the deed because I don’t want to. I get the feeling of I’m getting used just for sex. Mind you - I am someone who loves sex. But I feel disgusted when I think about doing it with him. I don’t enjoy kissing him as well. And now everytime he is nice to me - I start getting anxious because I will have to go through that process of telling him “no” for sex and him getting mood off again. My cousins tell me to give him a break and that he is a good man because “atleast he is working his ass off to pay my fees”. But I calculated, him paying 100% of my fees is the same as him paying 70% of the fees because he had to pay for his rent and stuff before. But now he moved in with me, so he doesn’t need to pay the other expenses.

My Aunt is visiting, and plans changed last minute for an event to happen today instead of tomorrow.

My dog, who was in my room with me, started to loose his mind which woke me up. I sleep naked. After pulling out my earplugs I could tell that there was someone in my house, and obviously I was terrified. I grabbed my intruder blaster and poked my head out of my bedroom door to my Dad in my living room. 
I was still half asleep, so I don't exactly know what I yelled at him besides ""Of course I didn't answer you! It's 9 in the morning!"" And ""Get out! I'm naked, what is wrong with you? Get out!"" But I feel bad now. 
After he left I tried to call back my mom but she didn't answer. Eventually I got a text from her ""apologizing"" for scaring me but apparently they were just so worried that I hadn't answered their calls and texts at 9 a.m on a Sunday that they had come over, and had been knocking on my door and my windows before deciding to come in. 
I texted her back saying that I didn't know what about my Aunt coming down to visit made them lose their manners about my house (they acted up in a different way last year when she came to visit), but that they needed to cool it.
I did not go to the event because no further information was given to me after they left. I assume that they had intended to come pick me up this morning so that we could carpool, but when I yelled at them they decided to go without me. I could have driven myself if they had given me the time and address where we could meet.

73,1ds8jt2,AITA for not supporting my boyfriend’s dream?,"I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for 5 1/2 years. He is my best friend and we do just about everything together. We do argue occasionally because we’re both stubborn, but we’re always able to work through it.. until now. 

For the past 3 years, my boyfriend has been wanting to fight MMA. Initially I supported him 100%. It was something he really enjoyed and I loved that he had found a hobby that made him happy. He eventually expressed that he wanted to train with the intention of becoming a professional fighter. I was hesitant at first, but I loved the fire in his eyes he had whenever he trained. I didn’t have much knowledge on MMA, but I thought many people do it, it can’t be that bad. We started going to fights to watch other people from his gym compete and I really did not enjoy it. It felt barbaric to me, but I continued going to them because it was something he enjoyed. I continued to do this until we watched his coach in a fight get KO’d. 

I’m not sure what clicked for me, but I suddenly became terrified by the thought that I would be watching the person I love getting the shit beat out of him on a regular basis if this continues. This led me to wonder what kind of injuries come with this sport. Upon doing some research, majority of injuries are head injuries. He is in the heavy weight class and from what I’ve found, this class has the highest percentage of head injuries. He already has a family history of Alzheimer’s so it doesn’t sound smart to participate in an activity that would increase the odds of getting Alzheimer’s. After that fight, I expressed my concerns about him fighting competitively. He brushed them off and said he already knew the risks. We got into an argument about it, but at the end of it all, he agreed to keep it as a hobby. 

Fast forward to last week, he brings up that he has resentment towards me because I am keeping him from achieving his dream of becoming a professional fighter. He hadn’t mentioned anything before this. He was trying to convince me that him fighting and going pro would be good for us and that this was something he needed to do. I don’t think there is anything that could convince me that fighting competitively is a good idea. After a couple of hours of arguing, I told him I needed to leave to get to work, but while at work he texted me that he wanted to breakup and had moved out all of his stuff by the time I got home from work. He said that he’s devastated that I won’t support him in his dream. I’m very upset with how he left, but that’s is a whole other issue.

Cut to this morning and we’re on the phone again. Due to the time difference, she’s 2 hours ahead of me. Her day was well under way and I was still getting out of bed. She was talking to a client and I was getting dressed, I needed to get on with my day and ended the call without saying anything. Didn’t think much of it since I’ve done it before and she hasn’t said anything. 

She calls me back a little later giving me shit for hanging up on her. I said “I’m sorry you feel that way. I didn’t think you’d say anything about it. You do this all the time and I don’t feel hurt by it.” She snapped saying to “miss me with that negative bullshit!” and ended the call abruptly. It caught me completely off guard since we weren’t even having a serious conversation.

77,1ds75sk,AITA for not showing up to work?,"For context, last week on Monday, I was asked to work the next day by one of my coworkers, and in return he would work Thursday and Friday for me. 
Well Tuesday rolls around and I go in to work and play the day out as it was a normal day. The next morning i wake up sick and I call off work, well the next day I am told that my shift is covered because my boss wanted to make sure that he had enough people for that night. So i’m sitting there wondering why it is that he would text me if he was informed of the schedule change. So i text the coworker who asked me to cover the shift and simply say “Hey, does (boss) know that you are working Thursday and Friday for me?” I then got a response on the lines of “I just texted him”.
So i’m like ok cool. 

Well, Friday comes and I go about my day just doing whatever to enjoy my free time, it is now almost 5pm and i get a text from my boss and my coworker asking where i was, i respond to both of them with, “(coworker) said that since i worked Tuesday for him that he would work Thursday and Friday.” I get a response from my boss saying “He knows of no such thing”. From my other coworker  get “well what time is he supposed to be here? Does (Boss) know? You’ll have to come in”. To which i reply “I can’t because i am out of town”. I am now sitting here wondering if my job is on the line because i cannot defend myself in this situation because none of the chats saved of the messages that were exchanged. (The messages were sent through Snapchat). I simply cannot fathom why he would lie about something so small. If he didn’t want to work then why couldn’t he have just told me and i would have went in?

So reddit, AITA?


UPDATE: So I went in to work as usual today 11-3 and did my normal stuff (Make dough, cover dough, grease pans etc.) my other coworker who I lied to about not being in town came in around 2:15 and asked why I was in a bad mood, obv because of friday. 
My parents had came in and got some food, obviously they knew about the whole situation and wanted to cover the bases on what happened with the three of us over the whole thing. The other coworker then starts vouching for me and explaining how it isn’t my fault, Props to her for that. She then starts to explain what happened with the other coworker and telling us about what was said to him and what did and didn’t happen. He was yelled at and told not to take anymore shifts that were not his. She then stated how he never texted my boss and telling him what is going on with the change. (Mind you, my bosses are greek and will leave in a few weeks to go back to Greece to visit family). So obviously the main boss that we talk to about scheduling is the one i talked to. He told me that i am not to change anymore shifts unless he is made aware of what is happening. Which to I agree with this.

78,1ds6ouq,AITA for not taking future MIL to the bridal appointment,"I am looking for advice on how to kindly explain to my future MIL why she was not invited to my bridal appointment. I went to a sample sale back in December and wound up buying the first dress I tried on. My 2 sisters and my mom were in the entourage. The dress was 60% off and was what I was looking for (simple, no lace, no beading, no mesh, fit and flair with a train) so it was a no brainer that it was the one. My expectations were low as I was worried there would not be a sample gown that would fit me, but this dress was it!

Now onto my future MIL. She has been so bitter this entire planning process and makes a face of disgust every time we show her our wedding plans (hates the colours, the venue, the food, the photographer... you name it, she will find something about it that she does not like). I hate what I see when I look in the mirror, so I was not mentally prepared for her inevitable criticisms of the dress, as (in my opinion) it is in a way a criticism of my body. My fiancee disagreed and said she would never be so harsh about my looks, but I do not feel that way. She would not have liked the experience. She would have talked me out of this dress. My future MIL is not one to buy something on the spot, she would have wanted me to go home and think on it before buying it. Now, this is practical, but not how the sample sale worked, as you had to say yes on the spot otherwise it would go to another bride. She also would not have been able to see my vision, as the dress still needed alterations. For these reasons, I knew taking her along to the appointment would have resulted in tears, confusion, and not finding a dress.

I SWEAR I intended to take her to the next shopping trip, which wound up not being necessary, and if she had not started giving me the silent treatment, I was going to take her to a bridal fitting.

Now here is where I might be the AH. Since getting the dress without her present, her negative comments have gotten much worse and I have started getting my guard up as soon as we start talking about the wedding with her. It is to the point where I cannot even handle constructive criticism from her because i am in full fight-or-flight mode when she is around. I am honestly not sure who is giving who the silent treatment at this point, but we have stopped talking to each other.

Tomorrow we are supposed to go have a talk with my fiancee present and I need to explain to her with a calm head why things have changed between us.

I feel like this all could have been avoided if she had just come to the damn bridal appointment in the first place, and if I had a spine, I could have just ignored her comments and bought the dress anyways.

It’s concrete which means the smell has started to seep in . In the colder weather I was like whatever but it’s hot now. My part is much larger 16ft where there area is much smaller like 2ft. Don’t ask me why I moved here after them and that is where the gate separates us. Because there area is so small they only use it as a personal bathroom for their dog . I have spoken to management who seems to be good friends with them and also them asking them to pick up after their dog right away or just please stop . 


I was fed up this morning when I heard they balcony door open and the dog shit on the balcony so I waited 5 minutes and nobody came out to clean so I knocked on there door . My words were what can I say or do to get you to pick up after you dog right away? And they rudely said if you waited 20seconds like I waited 5 minutes and they needed to clean her paws because they didn’t want pee and poop in there house. Like me either on the balcony?? And then we started to go back and forth and they told me I just shouldn’t use my balcony if it’s such a big issue and this is when there 9 year old joined in and said something in defense of her parents . My immediate response was excuse me but I’m only talking to the adults here. If it was as I had just told them to go screw themselves and all there dead family. Now two adults and two kids were screaming and cursing at me saying not to talk to her children and to grow up and it’s there balcony to do what they want . And I said maybe the kids shouldn’t be talking to me then?? And we screamed at each other until they threatened to call the management which I’m ok with because I’ve also been in contact . I also recorded the whole discussion because I knew it was about to get ignorant . Her kids are animals , throwing trash everywhere and trying to ring my door bell that also records and run.

Edit: important to know I did not yell first. The yelling started when I asked the child to let adults talk and they started yelling at me for saying that .

My husband and I have been together almost 12 years, married for almost six. We had an interaction today that’s bothering me, and I can’t determine if ITA or if what I said is valid.

My husband and I had just taken our almost three year old to his first movie. We were driving home, and my husband was on his phone playing a game that he often loses himself in and will require prompting to respond to others if they’re talking to him (like “hey did you hear me?”) I’ve asked him before not to play the game when we’re all in the car because of his tendency to dissociate into the game, and he’s said ok in the past. When he started playing today I was in the middle of a story. I noticed he was on the game, so I asked him to get off. He appeared irritated and hesitated (maybe 30 seconds, or so) and I added “it feels like you’re addicted to your phone.”

He got much more upset at this point and said that comment was rude and unnecessary. He started identifying things that I do that bother him (like answer the phone if my elderly mom calls me when we’re in the middle of something family related. I debated this point and said that yes, I answer to make sure she’s ok, not an emergency, and ask to call her back. He said I shouldn’t answer the call at all and said if it’s an emergency she needs to call 911, not me, and asked if I knew what an emergency is 2-3x when I didn’t agree.) 

The argument continued to escalate, and when I pointed out this was all stemming from my comment about him dissociating on his phone 1) during my story and 2) while we were in the car as a family, he said he deserved an apology for the rude comment I made about him being addicted.

He also said things that were much meaner once things had escalated (to the tune of he doesn’t want me to talk to him and just leave him alone). I’m really upset about the things he said, but I can’t figure out if I should apologize for my part in making the addicted comment.

84,1ds5pkj,AITA for distrusting my roommate and trying to handle the security deposit refund.,"I am the primary leaseholder for our apartment and arranged everything, including the security deposit, which we split evenly. Since I am the primary leaseholder, The refund will come to my address. My roommate now distrusts me due to a past carpooling dispute and demands the check be in his name, which I can't do. I plan to send him his half after deductions for cleaning fees, utilities, and damages. I worry he might withhold my half for Uber fees he incurred during our carpool dispute.

Me (42M) and fiance (62M) have been together for 7 years. For his birthday this year I kept asking him what he wanted to do several times. He kept answering it doesn't matter. This last attempt to see what he wanted to do he finally said that he didn't want his friends to feel obligated to get him something. The past 3 years we have been celebrating his birthday with his friends, which is totally fine. This year since I got that reply, I thought it would be just him and I. I planned accordingly and planned for a dinner at a very high end restaurant just for us.

One of friends (D) as a birthday that is the same day as his, July 1. D and my fiance are good friends but not super close. Anyways, he has been experiencing some more than usual mental health issues lately. One of our mutual friends asked us to dinner to celebrate D'Souza birthday. It happened to have been the same night I made dinner reservations for my fiance's Birthday. I asked my fiance if he wanted to reschedule so we could be there for D, he said it was up to me. Knowing that my fiance cares about D, I went ahead and made the reservation for my faince's actual birthday date instead of the night before.

Today though one of my fiance's closest friend (K) asks me if we're doing anything for my fiance's birthday. I explained to him the above situation and that I went ahead and rescheduled the dinner reservations. K then says we'll that's for D, so we'll plan something for my fiance. I went ahead and something to my fiance about it. Well, come to find out K took the reins and made plans. Then proceeded to tell me "" I hope you are able to make the reservations for another night"". My fiance then texts me and says we are going here. K then texts me and asks me for what is my fiance's favorite candy.

I have replied to either them. As a matter of fact I was so hurt that I finished mowing the yard, showered and left our home so I wouldn't be there when my fiance came back from church.

92,1ds4dl0,AITA for getting frustrated with my girlfriend's messages after my Dad just died?,"My Dad died a few days ago and I'm mourning him. There were some difficulties with getting my family to organize a celebration of life for him so it's mainly fallen to me. On top of this, I have a two month deadline to submit a research paper for my job before my contract is up. Afterwards I will have to move to another research institute (likely not in the same country). Finally, I have recently developed frequent gastrointestinal pain which is negatively impacting my quality of life.

My girlfriend went to Europe to visit her sister and travel/tour/sightsee. She booked her vacation long before my dad passed and flew out before then as well. I was with my Dad in the hospital for around 14 hours the day before he died. I called her to talk to her and she was supportive, and spent a long time on the phone with me.

Two days later however, while she's out touring, she sent me pictures of jewelry in the local shops that she likes in order to ""train me to understand her style"". I wasn't very responsive to this, but she seemed adamant that I understand her preferences. The next day she sent me another picture of jewelry and I also wasn't very responsive. She picked up on this and asked what was wrong, so I told her: ""My dad just died so jewelry shopping is not going to register in my mind"".

After this she apologized, and I told her I knew she ""wasn't trying to be insensitive but that there was a time and place for things like this"". As far as I was concerned, the issue was settled. This morning she messages me and tells me that she ""doesn't like the way I talked to her yesterday about the jewelry"", and that it's ""better if we don't talk rather than dealing with our issues over text"". She said she knows that I ""have a lot going on"" but that she ""also has her reasons for sending me messages"". I don't know what these reasons are, but I feel hurt by this.

From my perspective, my dad just died, much of the death arrangements have fallen to me, I'm weeks behind on work and my girlfriend's biggest concern is that I told her I didn't want to talk about jewelry or consider it important. I thought the issue was settled, but evidently, it wasn't settled for her. I feel like she has been insensitive and hasn't considered the issues I am facing, even though she knows about all of them.

There were some difficulties with getting my family to organize a celebration of life for him so it's mainly fallen to me. On top of this, I have a two month deadline to submit a research paper for my job before my contract is up. Afterwards I will have to move to another research institute (likely not in the same country). Finally, I have recently developed frequent gastrointestinal pain which is negatively impacting my quality of life.

My girlfriend went to Europe to visit her sister and travel/tour/sightsee. She booked her vacation long before my dad passed and flew out before then as well. I was with my Dad in the hospital for around 14 hours the day before he died. I called her to talk to her and she was supportive, and spent a long time on the phone with me.

Two days later however, while she's out touring, she sent me pictures of jewelry in the local shops that she likes in order to ""train me to understand her style"". I wasn't very responsive to this, but she seemed adamant that I understand her preferences. The next day she sent me another picture of jewelry and I also wasn't very responsive. She picked up on this and asked what was wrong, so I told her: ""My dad just died so jewelry shopping is not going to register in my mind"".

After this she apologized, and I told her I knew she ""wasn't trying to be insensitive but that there was a time and place for things like this"". As far as I was concerned, the issue was settled. This morning she messages me and tells me that she ""doesn't like the way I talked to her yesterday about the jewelry"", and that it's ""better if we don't talk rather than dealing with our issues over text"". She said she knows that I ""have a lot going on"" but that she ""also has her reasons for sending me messages"". I don't know what these reasons are, but I feel hurt by this.

From my perspective, my dad just died, much of the death arrangements have fallen to me, I'm weeks behind on work and my girlfriend's biggest concern is that I told her I didn't want to talk about jewelry or consider it important. I thought the issue was settled, but evidently, it wasn't settled for her. I feel like she has been insensitive and hasn't considered the issues I am facing, even though she knows about all of them.

93,1ds4am4,AITA for sleeping a lot?,"I (18F) and my bf (19M) had a conversation about my sleeping schedule. My bf goes to sleep late and wakes up early, typically waking up around 6 or 7 AM. I’m still a student and I can be very routine oriented so I typically go to sleep at 9 PM. Depending on the day I wake up around noon or later, but I never sleep later than 6 PM unless I take a nap. I also find it incredibly difficult to stay asleep but also to wake up, I typically wake up for around 30 minutes every couple hours during the night and then it takes me around 10 minutes to fully wake up when I’m done sleeping but even then I still feel extremely fatigued and have days where I’m even nodding off during my classes. My boyfriend recently told me he thinks I might have hypersomnia causing me to have trouble surrounding sleep. I agreed with him as most of the symptoms lined up with what I experience. We go a couple days and he asks me to try and wake up early so we can talk more before he goes to be a camp counselor (FYI the counselors at this camp are allowed to have their phones on them at all times, they get busy and can’t always be on them but they can always have them so it’s not like we wouldn’t be able to talk at all for weeks) I tell him I’ll try but I can’t promise anything and he agrees. I end up not waking up when we agreed and I wake up to texts saying things like “babe? Are you still asleep?” “It’s been hours babe” “wtf babe, today was supposed to be special” “doing this isn’t ok.” I texted him back and explained that I tried to wake up on time, I had set several alarms and put a timer on my lights so they would turn on to a bright white, but I couldn’t keep myself awake long enough to pick up my phone to text him. He explained it made him feel like I didn’t love him, and I understand that, but I feel show that I love him in so many ways other than that one instance. I told him that I had said I couldn’t promise I would be able to wake up early and he said “it’s about the effort you put into trying.” I feel like I did everything I could to try and wake up for him but to try and make it up to him I promised I would wake up earlier and go to sleep later than usual for a while so we could talk longer, but I couldn’t go to sleep late and wake up early so I’ve been staying up all night without even taking naps. I’ve been awake for 3 days now. I feel like I shouldn’t have to do this just to prove that I care about him and love him, and it feels like he doesn’t care about the effort I did put into try and wake up for him that day. Did I really do something wrong?

Edit: thank you to everyone concerned for my health. I usually only sleep like this on the weekends or days I have no classes, but I on days I do have classes my roommate will typically help me wake up in the morning. I do struggle with depression, and I have been seeking out a good doctor that I can afford with my poor insurance. It’s a bit ironic considering a discussion about my health regarding my sleep schedule was what started this. I am looking for a doctor to see what may be wrong and I have a couple options to choose from I just need to get the money to go to one

Edit #2: I forgot to mention, I do have a cat which helps me to wake up for at least 30 minutes at around 9 AM because that’s when he wants to have his morning canned food and he won’t eat unless I’m awake with him. (He was a rescue and gets nervous about eating without someone petting him) Some days I’m able to stay awake from then on, but most times I struggle to keep myself awake after feeding him.

Edit #3: thank you to everyone who has given me advice and gave their opinions in the matter. This was kind of a small thing, and I kinda feel like I’m overreacting to his comments and requests. I got a lot of feedback that I’ll keep in mind as I move forward.

97,1ds3r3r,AITA for lashing out at my sister?,"Okay so, this happened a bit of a while ago, like half a year, but I just, it keeps repeating in my head and I feel guilty over it. 

A while ago I decided to start dating someone long distance that me and my sister knew, let's call him One. I grew easily attached to One but, he had confessed he only talked to me to get closer to my sister, and that was before he found out she had been taken for 7 years. I also would constantly talk to him or, try to get his attention. At first it was good, we'd spend time together and give eachother space when we needed it but then, it changed. He would always tell me he's busy with military games, and wasn't in the mood to try much of what I wanted to do, be it playing games, or roleplaying, or any of that, but he still kept saying he loved me and I just, believed it? I kept roleplaying things he wanted and making characters and art for him because I liked hearing and seeing him happy. I don't know I just, kept holding on to hope. This ended up building up, over days and days, which became weeks, then months. But one day I was just, walking through the kitchen, texting him trying to ask if he wanted to play a game with me today, too which I got another 'I'm too busy', and I turn my head to see my sister was sat there, roleplaying with One.
I just, snapped, I felt guilty, I felt like this was my fault at first and I just, hid away, but my mom and sister noticed and, when they asked what was wrong I snapped at her. 
I knew I shouldn't blame her for it happening but, it hurt. It hurt so bad seeing my sister taking the attention and time of someone I thought I was in love with. And it hurt even worse because, I love my sister. She's amazing and kind and responsible and all the things I've never fully been, She's cared for me and been kind to me but I snapped at her. 
I remember yelling about knowing she'd hate knowing that her boyfriend ignored her for days only to find out he's hanging out with me or one of her friends and she got all quiet and that just, stuck with me. I broke up with One that same day, I couldn't handle seeing my big sister look all silent and dreary. 
Since that happened, my ex contacted me again and I, guess we're friends? One asked me why we even broke up because, honestly, he forgets things when it doesn't pertain to the stuff he likes, and it just, re-opened the wound and I can't stop thinking about it. I keep trying to figure out how to understand what happened and I end up just assuming how he felt when I know that I'm never gonna be able to tell. I just, I feel like I'm the asshole, especially for dwelling on it so long. I don't know how to properly get over this or how to feel. Am I the Asshole?

Edit for clarity: My sister knew me and One were dating, she was the first person I had told about it. She was the one who introduced us because she said One would like my art and our relationship just escalated from there. 
Another Clarity edit: This is a long distance relationship, the only way I could go on dates or spend time with him is through online activities. At the time my sister also has been in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend, who is not One. She does play and rp with her boyfriend too, like I had done with One.",Asshole,2024-06-30,"AITA for lashing out at my sister?

99,1ds2rqd,AITA I don’t really have a reason I just kind of feel like like an asshole and want opinions ,"Ok so it all started in the summer holidays (in Australia so around early January) I got a call from my friend saying that our close friend “Amy” (not her name, don’t like to name drop) had texted her saying ‘I don’t want to be friends anymore I’m blocking you’ completely out of the blue which was really weird considering that she was friends with her for over 7 years, anyway I saw her at the shops about a week after that and asked her why and she said “I don’t want to talk about it i’ll tell her why when we go back to school” and I respected that and didn’t pressure her to tell me. It’s been three weeks since we’ve been back at school and still no answer, she has fully stopped talking to me even when I try to talk to her she just walks away, finally the friend that she dropped is pissed and walks up to her and asks why she dropped her, she beat around the bush and said I don’t know just did. About a week after that a couple people told us that she was talking shit about us saying we were manipulative and bullying her (NOT TRUE) we just said “she’s lying don’t believe her” and all was fine until last week my friend put up a photo on her story with a photo of her crying in a tiktok that SHE POSTED mind you, it was on my friends close only tiktok that only had 4 people on it excluding me (it was new) and all of them had already seen the tiktok ALSO she wasn’t making fun of her crying she posted it because she was mad and she looked funny in the photo (this is where the chaos starts) Amy goes around saying “I’m gonna fight her for putting that up” school day ends and no fight, we yell out to her and she looks back and walks off I text her and ask why she didn’t reply and she said fuck off and blocked me, she then adds my friend back and starts saying all this shit like “you really needed Jem to back you up pussy” I told her to reply with “I didn’t ask Jem to back me up she just did because that’s what a good friend does, not like you would know” and then all of a sudden we realised how did she see the post how did she see any of this stuff we blocked her on everything. There was a rat, and it was one of our friends too, everything that happened before that didn’t matter anymore all we cared about was who it was but she refused to tell us, we both collectively asked all of our friends and her multiple times we got nothing then we confronted her again and she started bringing up that we dissmissed the fact that she was severely depressed, we had absolutely no idea she never told us anything and was showing no signs at all then she started screaming at us that we were terrible people until her friends had to calm her down. We tried one last time and asked her if she could atleast give us a hint, she says ok and tells us that their in my class which confuses me because everyone in my class either doesn’t talk to her or just straight up doesn’t like her so i asked her if she was lying and she said in a little innocent sing-song bitch voice “Maybe!” and then walked off.  That’s all, I know it’s long just lmk your opinions :) also it might seem that it’s weird that i’m involved but me and my friend are very close and help each other out with everything.",TL;DR,2024-06-30,"AITA I don’t really have a reason I just kind of feel like like an asshole and want opinions  Ok so it all started in the summer holidays (in Australia so around early January) I got a call from my friend saying that our close friend “Amy” (not her name, don’t like to name drop) had texted her saying ‘I don’t want to be friends anymore I’m blocking you’ completely out of the blue which was really weird considering that she was friends with her for over 7 years, anyway I saw her at the shops about a week after that and asked her why and she said “I don’t want to talk about it i’ll tell her why when we go back to school” and I respected that and didn’t pressure her to tell me.

About a week after that a couple people told us that she was talking shit about us saying we were manipulative and bullying her (NOT TRUE) we just said “she’s lying don’t believe her” and all was fine until last week my friend put up a photo on her story with a photo of her crying in a tiktok that SHE POSTED mind you, it was on my friends close only tiktok that only had 4 people on it excluding me (it was new) and all of them had already seen the tiktok ALSO she wasn’t making fun of her crying she posted it because she was mad and she looked funny in the photo (this is where the chaos starts) Amy goes around saying “I’m gonna fight her for putting that up” school day ends and no fight, we yell out to her and she looks back and walks off I text her and ask why she didn’t reply and she said fuck off and blocked me, she then adds my friend back and starts saying all this shit like “you really needed Jem to back you up pussy” I told her to reply with “I didn’t ask Jem to back me up she just did because that’s what a good friend does, not like you would know” and then all of a sudden we realised how did she see the post how did she see any of this stuff we blocked her on everything. There was a rat, and it was one of our friends too, everything that happened before that didn’t matter anymore all we cared about was who it was but she refused to tell us, we both collectively asked all of our friends and her multiple times we got nothing then we confronted her again and she started bringing up that we dissmissed the fact that she was severely depressed, we had absolutely no idea she never told us anything and was showing no signs at all then she started screaming at us that we were terrible people until her friends had to calm her down. We tried one last time and asked her if she could atleast give us a hint, she says ok and tells us that their in my class which confuses me because everyone in my class either doesn’t talk to her or just straight up doesn’t like her so i asked her if she was lying and she said in a little innocent sing-song bitch voice “Maybe!” and then walked off.  That’s all, I know it’s long just lmk your opinions :) also it might seem that it’s weird that i’m involved but me and my friend are very close and help each other out with everything.",,1.0468069314956665,1,0
100,1ds1yxy,AITA for not giving my deceased son’s belongings away?,"I (54M) have 3 children, Lisa (28F), Eric (26M) and Arwyn (16M). In April, Arwyn unfortunately passed away in a MVC.

I have a very strained relationship with Arwyn’s mom. We split up a long time ago and a few years ago she gave me the full custody of him because she wanted to concentrate on her new relationship. She has two more children, 10 and 6 M.

Arwyn didn’t leave much behind when he passed away. His car was totaled, and what was left was his Apple phone, laptop and watch and his PS5. All his things are in his room, untouched. Sometimes, though, I go through his phone just to take a glimpse of his life that ended too soon and too tragically.

Arwyn was very close with Lisa and Eric, and a few weeks since he passed away, they came over. I offered them to take some of his stuff. They picked some shirts and some hoodies. Eric also took his sneakers since they shared the love for brand name sneakers and the shoe size as well.

When Arwyn’s mom found out about it, she contacted me to ask if she could take some of his stuff as well. I was very sceptical about it since she never had a good relationship with Arwyn, but I let her come over anyway. She went through the remaining stuff and asked if she could take his gadgets.

I told her no. Maybe it’s selfish of me, but I’d like to keep all the memories preserved. His laptop has his high school paper draft that he never finished, his phone has the pictures of him smiling and his texts to his friends. His PS account has all his achievements in computer games.

She became visibly upset and said that I’m being unfair and selfish and that she could use his gadgets. I told her that it’s impossible to use them because she’d need to log out of his Apple ID account first and no one knows the password anymore. She became even more upset and accused me of hoarding his things. I told her that she could pick something else, some of his school awards or whatever. She said that I’m being unfair and called me an asshole. Now I’m left wondering if I actually am one.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-30,"AITA for not giving my deceased son’s belongings away?

103,1ds0p6w,WIBTA If I tell my friend to cut back or stop using weed?,"‼️Edit(I encourage you guys to read the update as well)‼️

I (24F) have a friend Liam (24M) that uses weed every single day and I wish I was joking. My friend Liam uses weed everyday and I’m getting sick of it, it’s getting to the point he just spends all his money on it/uses it on every “inconvenience”.  

Liam never used weed till two or three years ago. He used to house sit for one of his neighbors and one day his neighbor asked if he wanted weed for payment and Liam said yes (Liam has always been curious with weed/never tried it) Every since then he has been a major pothead. Liam has really bad mental health (same as me) and any time he feels anxious, has a panic attack, stressed out, having troubles to sleep, take it when he’s bored etc.. He will always take any form of weed to help him. 

Before you guys say anything Liam does go to therapy and it’s on any medication for his metal health. Liam and I even had the same opinion about weed before he started using it, like “You shouldn’t be using weed every day and only use it once in awhile.” , “People that cant live without weed/uses weed all the time have a problem”, etc. 

I’ve in the past “made jokes” about his weed intake and Liam will always say “Haha yeah I am “such a pot head” and I can quit anytime I won’t😂” which is a lie be he has TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES and he always go back to weed..I even softly encouraged him to go to doctors and get a medication that will help him/told him what medication I am on. And Liam says “Naaah I’m ok and I love weed too much to switch over to medication” (Liam doesn’t have anything against medication.) 

Weed is even affecting him to get a job..He has been putting in a couple applications in but when he finds out they require a drug test/do surprise drug test he doesn’t want to finish his application. (Liam gets money from his girlfriend or sometimes parents..He hasn’t had a job for about seven months..

Liam and I are getting an apartment soon but I don’t really wanna deal with the weed..Don’t get me wrong I’m not against weed (I know it sounds like I am but I’m not) but there’s a certain extent that using weed once in awhile is good but using it EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT YOU CANT FUNCTION  WITHOUT = ADDICT..

Basically we bought a flat (we live in the UK) 6yrs ago and it needed doing up. He was not keen and dragged his feet and I have a can do attitude and want to get stuff done rather sooner than later. 

We got in loads of arguments that everything depends on him and I should take the initiative to start. It was my first property and he had properties before therefore quite experienced how to do stuff. It was a hard learning curve for me but I started by painting the walls, later sanding, etc. and he finally started to work on the flat with me. He obviously did most of it but I contributed. 

Fast forward we bought a house 2yrs ago and our 5yr mortgage contract expires in 3yrs. We don't like the house very much amd quite keen to sell and move on. Properties in UK are not well maintained therefore you always end up doing them up. 

Again we have loads of arguments about which work needs doing but he does not commit to any because he wants his summers off and go fishing. 

Bare in mind he wants to get out asap but spends little time at home. 

He would like to start work indoors but no timeline when he wants to start. Yet again I get frustrated and decided against his wish and went over his head to start and sort out the front of the house like new steps which I paid out of my pocket. He is pissed off with me and argues that it was unnecessary and waste of money, against his strong decision and it created more work now that the front garden is destroyed and need to be redesigned. 

He has the tendency to wait and not do anything until it is nearly too late and he gets stressed out because poop just hit the fan. He complaints that I never listen to him or ignore his wishes. 

I feel stuck because I dont know anymore what is right or wrong or am I selfish because I just want to get the house sorted for us and enjoy it for a little while before selling it. 

Before I met my hubby I was single for 10yrs and relied on myself and I believe it is the cause of feeling frustrated and depressed because he just does not match my energy to get shit done. 

PS: I do everything around the house like cleaning, cooking, laundry, bills, bins, rubbish collection, etc! I mentioned that I could pay someone to fix the house and his reaction was to pay him a weeks wage to sort out the house?

I(16f) was invited by my sister Ruth(17f) to a small farewell party hosted by my sister's friend Rachel. (The party would begin around 3 pm and end somewhere around 4 am, and consisted of 5 kids below the ages of 6, parents and around 5 teenagers not including me and my sister) 

When my sister first invited me i was hesitant to give an immediate answer and told her to give me a couple hours to think about it as i knew no one in the party and my sister has a repeating pattern of making me feel like a ""third wheel"" in anything she invites me to without fail. 

After around 2 hours i rejected her invite and told her honestly that i knew no one there and that i didnt want to stay up late (im an early bird) , she started begging me to the point i got fed up and accepted the invite. 

The problem here is that my sister is friends with two girls, rachel and riley, who are closer with eachother than they are with my sister, so i later find out that the only reason i was invited by my sister is because she didnt want to feel like a third wheel when her ""friends"" were ignoring her, and so when she wasnt being ignored she would hang out with them and ignore me completely but would go to me when ever they ignored her. So most of the party i was left alone doing basically nothing. 

When we finally came home (we left early, around 12am) , my sister pretended there was nothing wrong and was telling me how she had fun and that we should do it again, i got mad and told her that she was a horrible person and to never invite me again. 

So am i the AH for getting mad? Even tho i accepted her invite knowing full well of the possibility of her making me feel like a third wheel?

So am i the AH for getting mad? Even tho i accepted her invite knowing full well of the possibility of her making me feel like a third wheel?

107,1drzkor,AITA for declining an invite to be a bridesmaid?,"Last year my friend asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding this spring. She had hinted prior to asking me that she wanted me to be in the wedding but honestly the thought immediately sent me into a panic. The reasons why being;  1) At the time that I was asked my husband and I were considering a relocation for work that would have occurred prior to the wedding. And while we would have made every effort to be back to our city for the event, I didn’t feel comfortable committing to such an obligation considering for most weddings there are a number of other commitments leading up to “the big day” for the wedding party to participate in. 2) The financial obligation played a role in my decision as well unfortunately. Disposable income is not something we have right now and knowing that I would be obligated to spend hundreds if not at least $1000 on the dress, shoes, hair, makeup etc, it just wasn’t something I could justify nor would be comfortable spending. 
3) On a deeply personal note, I have been struggling the last few years with my mental health. It’s something that only my husband and my therapists know about. Depression and anxiety have destroyed my social life, confidence and ability to feel hope for the future. I’m also not the type of person that enjoys a lot of attention so the thought of being in a wedding party and being “on display” in a sense, is anxiety inducing to say the least. I know big fancy weddings are something a lot of girls dream about all their life, but not me. My husband and I saved our money for a vacation and eloped, super low key, just the 2 of us.
Anyway, she naturally was upset but told me that she understood. Ultimately though, I was excluded from the bridal shower and bachelorette party and at the reception dinner my husband and I were assigned seating at a table exiled from everyone we knew (he got punished for my actions, all though he did get invited to the bachelor party).

108,1dryu7a,AITA being upset that my roomate has been using my shower cap?,"
My roomate is 19 and living “on her own” for the first time so I give her a little slack. She comes from a big family with lots of brothers and sisters. In our apartment we share kitchen stuff (she has destroyed at least one pan) and are pretty friendly about sharing food like say we need a bit of something for a recipe. The house vibe is casual but not a free for all. She started her job and asked if I had a lunch box she could use. She has “borrowed” said lunch box every day since September. She “borrowed” my parking pass the other day causing a whole mess for my friend who I told could park here. I had told her she could use it if I wasn’t going to be using it. She was confused and kind of confrontational when I called her out for it. The other day I found my shower cap drying in the bathroom after she had showered. That’s seems like obviously too much to me. What should I say to her so she gets that she’s overstepping my limits?

109,1drysoj,AITAH for calling my 14 y/o step daughter a trader?,"Major context needed....

My MIL has been committing financial fraud in my husbands name since 1999, when he was 19. I found the fraud while gearing up to purchase our own home. MIL forged a POA and used it to buy a house in his name unbeknownst to him. MIL has been a loan officer, title officer and notary for 20 years. My husband doesn’t get the real estate industry and even if he had questions, he would go to his mother as she was trusted in RE. He's the chef/artist type and during  this case, he gained a basic grip of the industry. The fraud is deep and complex cuz it involves a forged quit claim and forged homeowners insurance. The case is currently with WA PAO and OIC. I've been in constant contact by providing evidence and information to those who concealed and assisted in the fraud. MIL will be indicted in a few months. There is a civil case in the works.

My 14 y/o step daughter left her phone on the couch on the way to school. I called them to tell them I have the kids phone and a text from 'bubbie' popped up (Bubbie is the MIL) while I was talking to them. I asked for the kiddos passcode and read every text from bubbie. She has been in constant communication and lying to us about seeing bubbie.

The kid has been asking for case updates since 2022 as (I thought) she was interested in the legal aspects, as I would've been as a teenager (weird, yes, but we used to hold mock court growing up). I called her a traitor because she knows exactly what's happening and why we have had to pay the mortgage on the house MIL lives in as she stopped paying last spring. She knows the emotional, financial and medical stress that has affected all of us, yet lied about spending time with her on both her moms 'time' and our ‘time'. She told us she was with friends or would simply say ""I don't want to come over"". She lied about where she got new clothes and make up from when it was clear is was purchased with bubbie. Going through the text thread and cross checking my calendar, it was sickening how often she would ditch her dad for bubbie. I do not trust her about what information she says she shared about the case and think it’smore than what she knows. My husband feels betrayed, as well. He is more right brained and understands her wanting to see bubbie. I'm very much logic/ left brained and believe that it doesn't matter if someone is clearly toxic, whether or not they're family, they should be cut out.
The kids mother deemed the fraud case as unnecessary despite being affected by it, as they were married when is was happening. She felt that it’s unfair to keep her away from bubbie and lied to my husband about it. There is a defined line of financial and emotional abuse from MIL which should be enough to keep any kid away. Especially your own.
AITAH here? I'm not even sure how to be around the kid at this point. I've been with her dad since she was 2 and we have always been close. But, this instance really hurt.

111,1dry461,AITA For telling my in laws to stop buying our kids random stuff? ,"

My wife and I have two children who are both under 3. We make a decent income together and try to treat our kids without spoiling them.

My in laws live about 4 hours away from us and are both elderly, so they only get to see their grandkids a few weeks apart. 

I don't know if it's due to this , but they constantly buy stuff for our kids without checking with us first, despite how much we tell them to stop it and ask us first. 

The problem is a lot of it is stuff like a suitcase full of clothes that the kids won't grow into for years, or broken toys that we 'could probably fix', or a giant inflatable water slide that we have no space to put out. Basically my MIL sits all day on Facebook Marketplace and Gumtree and just impulsively buys anything she sees because 'it was a really good price!'. 

We try to refuse these items, telling them the kids won't like them or we don't have the space for it, but they just won't listen and every month we get a delivery of something else or they visit with van full of assorted stuff despite our pleas to ask before buying. 

So are we the assholes for having arguments with them for never asking first, and constantly buying random stuff for our kids that we don't need or the kids won't play with and demanding we take it?

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions on creating a Gift List on something like Amazon, that might be a good compromise, as long as we can then convince our MIL to stay off Facebook Marketplace and control her impulse buying...

112,1drxzw0,AITA for not caring about what my friend does?,"Mandatory written on a throwaway disclaimer. This may sound fake but I really don’t know how to tell it any different because it was a real experience.

I (21M) have a very outspoken close friend (21M) who isn’t afraid to “appreciate” a random passing woman’s beauty. Usually it’s turning his head back or quietly telling me to look, but I ignore him bc I have my eyes on a girl who I’m talking to, Jessica. She doesn’t really like my friend for reasons other than this though, she privately confided in me that he gives off corny white frat boy vibes, and off some jokes he makes  seems like several -ists (sexist, racist) although he’s said they’re just jokes.

I’m writing this because this past weekend we were hanging out and during our time together went inside a bodega for some cold drinks. It was a kind of ghetto area for lack of a better term.

Inside also was a Hispanic looking woman with her probably elementary school aged daughter. She was wearing tight jeans and a crop top , and even I had to admit she looked good. My friend points me out to her, I say that she indeed is beautiful and move on, thinking he would too since a guy walks in not long after and pecks her on the cheek.

The problem arises when while paying for his drink my friend goes up to the dude with her and says “well damn you sure know how to pick them huh”. Me thinking the dude was gonna try to fight my friend was nervous, but he laughs and says “why do you think I picked her dude look” and kinda motions at her whole body. We then leave and I tell him I’m surprised that went so well.

Later on I’m telling Jessica this whole story because it was equal parts surprising and funny, and she says “yuck he’s so fucking gross dude”, and “honestly if your keeping him around idk what that says about you”. I get a little mad that she randomly is criticizing my friendship choices and ask her what that has to do with us. The conversation turns a little cold after this and she ends up leaving me on read after a short lived painful dry conversation.

115,1drx8d5,AITA For how mine and my daughter’s relationship has turned out,"I 35f have a 19 yr old daughter, I had my daughter at 15 and as she got older, we had such a deep bond.
She was living at home paying £100 a month, with the stipulation she saves at least £100 a month also. She got with her boyfriend two years ago. Everything seem to be fine then he basically few months ago just moved in. I’ve had to have conversations about the state of the bedroom, not putting things away emptying the washer and tumble dryer of other people stuff and just overall not being considerate. it all came ahead because I’ve had enough and I gave her the ultimatum either her boyfriend pays £20 a week or he can only stay two nights a week,he refuses to pay and still pushed and slept over more.
 This became a major argument and they went to stay at his mums,
The deal was when she moved out her younger brother would get her old room due to it being bigger. This caused another meltdown from her and she’s just been a nightmare. She’s kicked off because I moved her stuff from her old room to her brothers bedroom, 
Things she doesn’t need,she thinks she can just leave them in my house. So I’ve taken my house key back and told her until she takes the stuff she doesn’t want. She’s not getting her boyfrienda tools.She hasn’t been coming to walk her dog,and just being overall disrespectful. I’ve started noticing how manipulative her boyfriend is, but she still has to take some of the blame.over the last year of her driving she’s had at least £1000 off me to fix her car because she couldn’t afford it and I just wanted her to be happy,while working part time and being at college plus she has bad alopecia and it was me who took her to the doctors, bought her a wig, held her hand when she had to have injections into her head, et cetera, we finally managed to have a conversation, which was over the phone and her boyfriend was in the background telling her what to say.
I told her how disrespectful she has been to me and how hurt I was and how her actions,have caused our bond to shatter. I did say at that time, I don’t know if we can go back to the way things were or if I was even ready to try. Things have got so much worse while I was away Friday night, her work van was damaged and she blamed me. Which hurts so much since I’ve been her parent for 19 years she would never of accused me before the argument or before she got with this boyfriend. During this time, I thought things would’ve improved after the conversation and we cleared the air but apparently not, I can’t do this anymore and I need to look after my own peace.The reason I’m asking if AITA should I have just kept quiet and let him live at my house?

116,1drx0eb,AITAH for accidentally inviting the press and ruining the tournament / someones moment of history,"I heard about a person who was about to do something historic and asked to be connected. This person agreed to let me come and tell their story. I made plans around it. Day of came and I was told I can't take photos. They asked which publication I was with because the maybe they could help. I mentioned I'm just a person with a camera. They asked that I don't take any then - which I agreed to. I noticed quite a few cameras for news and photographers but I assumed it was because they were all press or official in some way.

As I was waiting for the guys turn I got a text from a guy I had met (like once) that works for a TV station. I told him where I was as a response to him telling me his plans. He then sent a flier from the exact event. I thought wow what a coincidence. He tells me he used to do the thing the tournament was about so I talk to him about how little I know. He then tells me his producer had told him it would end pretty early. I told him they were definitely delayed. He asked if I thought he could get an interview with the guy I said the guy himself probably won't mind but the tournament people are quite apprenshive so I'd recommend asking them.

I guess they decide to come - there was no real confirmation until they were at the gate. I don't think much of it because again, he sent the poster and mentioned his producer so I assumed they had already been aware and had considered it. I even thought maybe they could get me a press pass and I could take photos for them.

As I'm waiting, the people at the tournament tell me I can take photos since so many people are anyway and just asked that they don't go to a publication. I say that's fine because again I'm not a journalist. 

I'm minding my business. Enjoying things wnd and then the TV people (from the text appear). They start talking to me. When they were talking to me I asked how they knew about it and they said because of me. This through me off because remember they sent me the poster and made it seem like they knew and never asked if they could come. They tell me they found the poster online. Now alarm bells are ringing in my head but they tell me they got permission from the university to film (where the tournament was being held) and they went to talk to the guy and the organizers to confirm permission.

I went about my business. While I was off talking to others I got a text message from the guy saying we all need to leave because they won't let him compete with press there I went to talk to him and he seemed super upset. The TV people had left already and so I thought okay let me leave too even though I'm not press.

Now I feel like an absolute asshole. I sent a few messages apologizing but the guy hasn't messaged me back.

 My dad and I have never really been close, but I think he thought we were. I lived with him and my step mum throughout highschool and had severe depression and burn out in that time (I have several auto immune conditions and have recently been diagnosed ADHD). 

My dad made several comments that really affected me and I do realise he did not do that intentionally to hurt me. He was a strict parent, very traditional, and we butted heads several times because I found joy in books and music. He also kicked me out at 19 for staying at a female friends house (who he has met before) overnight without his permission. 

I am a people pleaser and I find it really hard to have confronting conversations, but everytime I see him I get anxious, overwhelmed and resentful. I  just want for him to know his words and actions were hurtful. I've tried to have the conversation in passing but he gaslight me saying 'I didn't do/say that'. I feel like I have half assed all conversations so far due to anxiety, so may partially be my fault, and need a proper sit down to communicate.

My half brother (18m) lives with them and suffers with anxiety and depression and I've seen my dad make similar comments to him.

Where I may be the asshole is that my dad has recently been diagnosed with chronic leukaemia, where he could live well for the next 30+ years, or he could deteriorate in the next 5.

My mom is a radiologist and was in med-school for the first years of my life. after med-school she worked long hours and was rarely home when i was awake, so my earliest memories are spent with my nanny. 
I think i have always resented my mother because after she had my sister(let's call her Sally), who is five years younger than me, she had already finished schooling and was set into a comfortable job, so she had more time to raise Sally. from my point of view she basically neglected me and favored Sally (i'm not claiming this is how it actually was, just that's how i felt). 
I only spend time with mom when Sally is there too. That would be fine but mom and Sally regularly spend time just them two. and it's not like Sally cannot be left alone, my dad works from home and has stated in the past that he is fine with watching Sally during work. and i mean shes 9 it's not like if you take your eyes off her for a second she'll eat a whole piggy bank and die or sm. 
My mom says that she has already ""made up lost time"" when i ask her to spend time just me and her and use my early childhood as a reason. The problem is that she didn't make up this time by spending time with me but rather by buying me things. and while i am grateful for that, i'd give up all the things that she has purchased me if she would just spend time with me. Just me and mom. But no. anytime we are together Sally must be there too. i can't even remember the last time it was just me and mom.
My dad got a job a few years before i was born, so i didn't see him much. but he has made up for that time lost by spending time with me and going out of his way to be a good dad . he clearly cares about me. i think that my dad handled the situation well. he has never shown clear favoritism between me and sally.

let me make it clear, i am extremely grateful and appreciative for my dad and moms hard work. because of them both my family has lots of benefits many people do not. 


i've been thinking about this a lot recently, and i want to talk to my mom about it because maybe she doesn't even realize what she is doing. but considering how fucking emotional i am and how defensive my mom is, it'll probably end up an argument. so, would i be the asshole if i yelled at my mother for going to school instead of staying home to raise me and never spending time with just me??

sorry if any of this is hard to understand. i'm literally just jotting down thoughts as i go

EDIT: So i've read over some of the replies and thank you to those who have responded. i will definitely take your advice into account when i talk to my mom. I am just now realizing how misleading my original title is. I definitely should have looked at it again before posting. I do NOT blame my mom for spending the first few years of my life in medical school. It's the actions that followed that made me feel alienated from her and the reason i made this post. Im not saying she should have dropped out of medical school for me. I understand thats not a wise decision for anyone. Even if i felt slightly neglected at the time, it was good for our whole family in the long run. 
Another thing i'd like to clarify is that when i talk to my mom, im definitely not going to begin with any yelling, i was just predicting it because when i try to talk to her about how i feel it usually turns into an argument. I love my mom so much and i'm grateful for everything that she does and did for me. It would be so much more simple if she would treat me and Sally the same way.

","Hello Reddit! This is a minor quibble, but it still seems to be getting brought up in my personal life so I thought I'd ask the anonymous strangers of the internet if I should apologize or not.



I (28M) am part of a large friend group, including a newcomer to the group, ""Evangaline"" (19F). She seems pleasant enough and honestly it's clear why she was so readily accepted into our group. She sometimes talks about her hobby being a ""twitch streamer e-girl"" (her words) and how she hopes one day she can quit her job and ""live off simps"" for the rest of her life. Honestly, it's the kind of attitude I'd find incredibly vain and facile if it wasn't true- she's good looking enough to make it as a Bell Delphine type (if you don't know who that is, I warn you against looking her up, lol). That is to say, while she's more immature than people I find a closer connection with, there is something about her that's witty and charming that drew me to her, despite my better judgement.



I have tried to take an appropriate mentor role in her life. She claims to have ADHD and struggles with a lot of adult responsibilities, so I've helped her with some mini-crises she's found herself in. Helping her when her car broke down on the side of the road or helping her set up autopay for her rent, things like that. 



A few weeks ago, I thought I would give her some advice on something I found innocuous. Evangaline is a notoriously terrible texter, and sometimes it's honestly hard to figure out what she meant due to her typos. I know that having an all-lowercase, relaxed style of typing is more common in her generation, and she'll title her twitch streams in that way in order to be endearing. But I thought I'd tell her that when she's talking to adults, it's not charming to try and figure out ""ou sid the meeting go bas"" means. I'll give you a second to try and figure it out dear reader before I proceed.



She meant ""Oh, did the meeting go bad?"" Trying to figure this out was the last straw for me, and I politely but firmly asked her to please take time typing out her messages and checking them for errors before sending them to me, and that I found it rude that she expected me to spend time trying to decipher what she had to say before I could respond. I don't mind a typo at a regular rate, but she types so fast it can be hard to read.



This did not go well. I thought it was reasonable for me to ask, with how legendarily bad she is at typing, but she took it really badly. We still talk sometimes, but it feels like she's drawn away from me, and any potential our relationship had is gone, or at least on pause for now. When we do talk, she will sometimes make jabs at me for being a ""third grade spelling teacher"" and distances herself from me by calling me her ""naggy uncle"". Should I just suck it up and apologize for something I don't think was that big of a deal, or should I tell her to stop acting childish? ",Asshole,2024-06-30,"AITA for asking my friend to communicate with me in a respectful way?

124,1drw210,AITA for requesting my fiancée to quit vaping since we are getting married?,"My (30F) fiancée (29M) just won't quit vaping. We are getting married next year and he has been a wonderful partner except I'm having a hard time reconciling with this issue.

He quit vaping last year until something happened (its a complicated life problem) and I caught him doing it again this January. It was a big fight, I was very hurt and I felt very betrayed. he apologized, said he is ashamed of what he did and promised not to do it again. two weeks later, I caught him again. woman's intuition. He said he was just finishing that last one and quit forever and apologized. I let him pass. weeks later, I felt that hunch again. I checked his bag and saw another vape. That felt so crushing, i feel stupid and tired, I contemplated: do i even bother telling him. He said i should never touch his things again; that I was invading his privacy. I told him I cant believe you're the one getting angry here when you lied. he told me, If lying is the issue, he said he wont lie now: he wants to continue so he is telling it now. And then I had no choice but to let it be because no matter how it hurts and bothers me, I know i cant force a person to change. 

I made a compromise with him to try quitting this June. He was able to do it last year, why not now? So I was really happy last May I saw him throw his last vape. So first week of June he was smoke free but he was totally a different person. He was irritable, quiet, and it bothers me. One Friday i felt again that something was off, he kept on getting out and it seems like he is in a better mood. We had to go out so I rode in his car. And guess what, I saw a new vape in one of the pockets. of course i feel sad but I tried to consider how he feels too. instead of facing him angrily, I just told him, I know about it.  And then he was still denying it but said, are you still happy I quit but still with resentment? Why not just accept it? I said that, i know about the vape, I saw it. I'll let you be since we are just hurting each other because of this. But promise me to lessen it with the goal of quitting as we are about to make our own family soon. We should start being healthy. To share, he has a family history of hypertension so I am trying to help him avoid unhealthy stuff but.. yeah. He agreed to it. i was happy to see it, the vaping was not so frequent 2 weeks after that talk. But this weekend, he sureeeely was increasing intake again. I tried reminding him about it but he just gets upset. I am emotionally tired and it seems I am the only one always giving ways. Dont get me wrong, he is a wonderful person, caring and responsible and loyal. It's just this vaping issue. I even told him this is 90% of our conflicts, and I asked him nicely if can he just quit it.. 

TL; DR: AITA for requesting my fiancée to quit vaping?  He wasnt able to quit after trying/promising so many times. He knows this is a big issue for me. Since I think he cant quit now, I let him be but everytime i see him go out to do it, it ruins me.

125,1drvzxh,AITA for cancelling plans after miscarriage? My friend is mad at me. ,"This is a throwaway account so I don’t get identified. 

My childhood friend is mad at me for cancelling plans. We are both women in our 30’s. 

We were supposed to go out with 5-6 other women for dinner and drinks. 
Unfortunately, I had a miscarriage a couple weeks before the event and I was extremely sad and unhappy, and on top of that I was still bleeding a lot. So I was honest with everyone and just told them I simply was not ready for such an event either psychically or mentally. 
She opened my message but never answered, and I just immediately knew that she was mad. One of the other women called me and confirmed my suspicion. 

I love her very much and I hate that she is mad at me. I have always been the one to apologize and try to smooth things over if there have been conflicts. I can't recall her ever apologizing to me for anything. And when she is angry, she just ignores me until I give in and do what she wants. But that's her general way of handling things, so it's not just towards me.

We have not talked in three weeks which is very unusual. 

Typically I would call her to make to make up. But this time I feel like she has crossed a line and that I should be to one being mad. I’m in a really hard situation already and she knows that stuff like this affects me. 

Am I the asshole? 
What would you do? 

English is not my first language so apologies for any mistakes I might have made. 

Edit: 
Thank you so much everyone for taking time to answer my question. I have read all your comments several times and it has really put a new perspective on the whole situation.

126,1drvvt1,AITA for Asking that the Shower Curtain Cover the Shower?,"AITA - My partner and I own a house and we are slowly renovating/remodeling as we can afford. My partner is definitely the one who takes care of the house working (air conditioning, water heater, bathroom fan, etc.) and I am the one who does more of the cleaning and ""aesthetic"" bits (painting, re-carpeted, plants, curtains, etc.). My partner makes more than I do, and they do take care of the house. I can be a bit absent minded so I can not notice things for a very long time. My partner will make a huge house update and I won't notice for weeks until they point it out. That sounds like it sucks for my partner, but I keep everything clean and dusted and laundered so the day to day is easier for my partner. So the trade off is super equal. 

  
As we replace things that need to be replaced in our house, we choose to take care of the house versus the aesthetic. The roof, gutters, fridge, doors, windows, etc. It makes total sense and I 100% support this. However, some things will need to eventually get replaced and one of those things is the bathtub. It is gross. I have tried every tactic I have ever seen on YouTube or the rest of the Internet (as has my partner) and we can't get the stains out. We don't want to do some ""tub fitter"" thing because we want to remodel the whole bathroom and make it nice at the same time. Which is some years off. In the meantime, our bathtub is discolored and gross. 

  
So to our current issue. My partner's mom is in town. We rarely have people visit/stay with us, mostly just her once a year for one week. I cleaned the tub three times with three different cleaners. It is better and 100% clean and disinfected, but it is still stained. So I have been pulling our shower curtain over the whole tub to hide it in between uses. My partner says opening the curtain to dry it creates mold on the ceiling. Everything I have read has said that keeping the curtain bunched creates mold. I'm the one that cleans the tub/bathroom 90% of the time and I think when we bunch up the shower curtain, that weird orange bacteria that is slimy builds on it. 51 weeks out of the year, I am fine with this. 

With my partner's mom visiting, I just want to cover up the stains when we can. So I keep pulling the shower curtain closed. My partner insists it's bad and keeps pulling it back. AITA for asking for just one week of the whole year to keep it closed when not being used to save me from humiliation? Or am I being completely unreasonable?

My best friend (21f) has been there for me since my sophomore year of high school. We are extremely close, we have the same interests, text and talk to each other 24/7 and we hangout almost every single day. I am also the maid of honor in her wedding. 

The moment I got engaged I knew my best friend was gonna be my MOH, she knows me better than anybody, possibly even more than my fiancé. When I mentioned this to my parents I was surpised to hear that they disagreed and believed my sister should be my MOH. I asked why and my dad said because me and my sister are close and just the fact that it is tradition and she is your sister. My mother also said the same thing. I brought up the possibility of having two maid of honors but something just felt wrong of me to do that. I feel as if I would be making my sister MOH just because it is tradition and my parents said so. I also felt as if that would be taking away some of the honor from my best friend who would truly be fulfilling moh duties.

I responded “i think ive just decided on having (my best friend) as my moh, ive been so conflicted over the whole thing, and she is my sister and i love her, but i believe (my best friend) has earned the role of moh”

I never received a response and was left on read.

131,1drujs7,AITA for not sharing details of my relationship with my sister? ,"I (30f) don’t often share relationship details with my sister (34f). I used to tell her pretty much everything because, well..she’s my sister! But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more private, especially with my her. 

She is judgmental of my relationships no matter how happy I am and tries to tell me she’s just “being protective”. But I honestly just see it as her being a brat. Whenever she shares things with me, I’m always happy for her. If she’s happy, I’m happy. 

So I recently dated someone who was not-so-great and I was very aware of it, but I continued dating him anyway. I told my sister a little about him, she told me I shouldn’t be with him, and of course I stuck up for him. I didn’t tell my sister many details while we were dating, but recently told her about all the shit that went down when him and I broke up (it was pretty traumatizing). 

At the time of me telling her, I could laugh about it since enough time had passed.  It was a shocking situation but I’ve moved passed it and it is what it is! I’m completely fine now and I’m in a very very healthy and happy relationship. 

So as I’m telling my sister the details of how my last relationship ended, I can see her face changing. I KNEW, before I even told her, that I shouldn’t have. By the and of my story, she was mad at me. She said that she had previously tried to talk me out of dating him and that I would just get upset and tell her I didn’t want to talk about it (which is true!). We were out with our cousin and my sister is just sitting there so mad at me. She wouldn’t even look at me. It was very uncomfortable. Then she asked me if I’ve been std tested since I’ve been with him and I said yes but that I didn’t want to talk about that and she got more mad. 

This kind of thing happens every time I share something with her and I should know better by now. I’d really love to keep my new relationship mostly private from her because anytime I’m super happy about something, I share it with her and she completely ruins my excitement. Every single time, without fail.

132,1drujef,AITA for not eating an extra piece of chicken,"Me 41F had a fight with my mum 74F at dinner today I am currently sitting in my room unable to sleep because my heart is pounding and I am feeling somewhat guilty but at the same time I feel like I actually won a fight with her for once.

I have problems with over eating and snacking and am overweight. I have been slowly trying to stop myself and one of the things I do to try and cut back on how much I eat is put in a rule that my plate should never have more then my mum's.

Tonight she heated up some fried chicken from the freezer and some leftover rice for dinner since i messed up the dinner I had planed on cooking. Things started off normal we each had a piece of chicken and a side. She then took my plate and came back with one piece for her and two pieces on my plate. She said she left the other piece in the kitchen but would go back for it later. I didn't say anything but suspected this was a lie (it was).

I ate normally but left the extra piece behind and when I finished eating put my plate in the kitchen so it was out of my sight. when she finished her piece I asked her so are you going to have the other piece of chicken. She said ""no I saved it for you to eat later with some more of the side."" I said to her well we can have it for lunch another day since I also left a piece of chicken behind.

This triggered her into a screaming rant half of which I couldn't understand. The one part I did get was something about her not understanding why I am so obsessed with eating the same as her when I am constantly snacking (I try not to but cant always help it). She then went into her bedroom and closed the door. I waited for about 20 minutes or so because we were in the middle of a show that i wanted to finish watching with her. I finally got fed-up then got ready for bed. I called down to her good night she responded with something i couldn't understand and that was it.

Should I have gone down and apologised or should I just leave things as they are till tomorrow?

Extra background since these are usual things that get asked. I live at home with her mostly due to depression and minor mobility issues (arthritis in my knees since i was little). It is also far too expensive where I live for me to seriously think of moving out. I pay rent and have told her I can pay more if she needs me to (she always says no) so instead I pickup and pay for most of the food. We share most of the household chores with her cooking on most week nights (i work) and me cooking on the weekend. Most days we are fine but we do butt heads occasionally and when we do its usually a big fight as she hates talking things out. I am seeing a therapist and would normally bring something like this up with her but since i cant sleep and my therapist is on vacation i thought an outside anonymous opinion might be helpful.

133,1dru14n,WIBTA for asking my roommate to get rid of his cat?,"
I recently moved into a new apartment with my roommate after living together for a couple of years. I had floated around the idea of getting a cat as I’ve always wanted one, but ultimately decided against it because I am not in a comfortable place financially to adequately take care of a pet. My roommate decided he also wanted a cat and said he wanted to get one too, but we never discussed having one in our apartment.

On the day I moved in, I showed up and he already had the cat in the apartment. This is how I found out about the pet - no prior text or discussion about it. I didn’t feel too angry at the time but as time has passed I’ve realized this was messed up. In addition, my parents co-signed our lease on behalf of BOTH of us since his family lives abroad, so we’re doing him a huge favor in that regard. In the month that the cat has been in the apartment, he’s eaten my plants that Ive had for months/years, causing me to keep my room door shut so that A/C does not flow into my room even during the heat wave (we have one a/c unit in the living room). I have also had to deal with the cat jumping on counters while I’m cooking - which is dangerous for the cat - as well as cat hair EVERYWHERE. I don’t think it’s fair to me or the cat because the only solutions are keeping the cat in the room (not good for the cat) or keeping my room door shut all day (not good for me, my room gets too hot to sleep in). I have tried using vinegar to keep him out, cat grass/cat safe plants to distract him, and training him but nothing works.

This is not the cat’s fault obviously, I truly hope the cat can find somewhere where can freely roam without repercussions, but I don’t think this is the best place. I also don’t want to flat out tell my roommate to get rid of the cat, but I don’t see any other solution. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-06-30,"WIBTA for asking my roommate to get rid of his cat?

I, (F23) isolated myself after my best friend moved countries.

A little back context, my best friend (F22) moved countries 8 months back. She was always the depressed, lonely, socially awkward friend that I loved. She lost her spark in life and never had the interest to do anything except read books and stay away from people. She was kinda bubbly to the people she was close to. She barely had 1-2 close friends and planned her life in this country.

It was all so sudden when her dad decided to take her and her mom to another country for good. She became more depressed because she never wanted to leave this country and told me she wouldn't make friends in college and would just be alone.

Ever since she moved, her life changed for the good. She's gotten more confident, outgoing, bubbly, she has a whole group of friends which is shocking to hear, shes got an accent, she has a lovely house, shes gotten better at studies, shes less insecure about herself, she dresses more freely etc.

My life on the other hand went down a spiral ever since she left. It broke my heart because even if I had a boyfriend, she was my soulmate. I needed her every step of the way and no man or woman would ever compare to her.

My life has gotten worse, I battle with depression every passing day not knowing if its my last, I've become more socially isolated, i barely talk to anyone except my boyfriend, I have more family issues, Ive gotten more insecure and ive lost my spark in life. I stole her old personality basically.

I slowly started talking to her less because I had no idea how to deal with my own problems. People think im jealous of her, and in reality I am a little envious. But I will never be anything but happy and proud of how far shes come.

I still tell all my friends shes my soulmate and noone could replace her, even if im not talking to her.

Its just been hard hearing about someones life which is a thousand times better than yours, and its hard not to feel shitty when my own world is falling apart slowly. I have no more interesting stories to tell unlike her and I dont want to burden her and bring her down because of my own depression.

So I isolated myself, stop talking even tho she still tries getting in touch with me.

I miss her terribly. I still cling onto her cardigan that I loved whenever im having a mental breakdown. I still want to run into her arms and tell her everything thats bothering me. But I dont want to steal her spark. I want her to be happy.

137,1drt2qp,"AITA for doing the same? In-Law Visits exclude me from their Brunch/Dinners ""As a Family""","Hi Everyone!

I (30M) have been married to the wife (30F) for almost 3 yrs.. 2 yrs ago, I moved to the other side of the country (US) for wife's job. She and her family are from the Middle-East. Her sister lives in the next state over.

Each time they've visited, they go out as a family to dinner/brunch at a nice place without me. I expressed it made me uncomfortable and felt disrespectful especially considering they were staying here. This continued to happen with every visit. I expressed my increasing discomfort and anger with each occurrence.

Cue current visit. They are to be here in our home from Thursday-Tuesday.

After work, at 7:45 I go out to the deck for a smoke and to decompress. 8:25PM MIL comes to the deck and tells me dinner reservation is at 8:30 and to get ready.

No one told me anything? I go upstairs and wife is getting ready in a room. I pop in and incredulously ask her why she didn't tell me about dinner?? Her response was:

""You could have asked, couldn't you?""

I tell her this is incredibly rude. She said this is about FIL's birthday. I go to my desk for more work and ask wife to let me know when she's done getting ready.

SIL and wife both pass behind me while getting wife ready not saying a word. I then hear them go downstairs and the front door closing. I go downstairs and they're gone. I called wife 4 times. No answer.

I go off about why she didn't say anything to me and about how they all ditched me and how this is extremely disrespectful. She says:

""Oh, okay! I'll tell them you said so.""

They get back at 11:00 PM. SIL asks if I ate. I said yes even though I didn't. FIL looks at the TV and asks if I'm watching X. I curtly say yes. They say goodnight and go to bed.

Saturday morning, I go get breakfast. I took extra time bc I wanted to be anywhere away from them. I get a msg from FIL:

""We are making brunch for everyone.""

Wife txtd asking where I am.

I didn't reply.

FIL and MIL are in the kitchen saying brunch is ready and to please eat. I tell them ""I ate."" before heading upstairs to my desk to game for the first time in months. 

Wife comes and says something but I can't hear her.

6:30 PM I go downstairs to heat up food.

SIL is on the couch. Wife, MIL, and FIL walk downstairs. No one says anything to me. Wife is on the middle of the stairs when she yells:

""Is everyone stressed out and quiet because of that RUDE, boring, BUZZKILL!? Don't let that fat POS ruin your day.""

I respond:

""Oh, look. It's a talking garbage can. Hey Oscar!""

SIL looks at me and throws up her hands. I continue to eat my sandwich as everyone leaves.

Wife texts me that MIL is crying in the car because of how uncomfortable I made all of them. They are all leaving, wife included. I said their leaving is completely fine by me and that they're the ones who showed the disrespect first. They are all leaving tomorrow morning to a lake resort for the remainder of their time.

AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-06-30,"AITA for doing the same? In-Law Visits exclude me from their Brunch/Dinners ""As a Family"" Hi Everyone!

I (30M) have been married to the wife (30F) for almost 3 yrs.. 2 yrs ago, I moved to the other side of the country (US) for wife's job. She and her family are from the Middle-East. Her sister lives in the next state over.

Each time they've visited, they go out as a family to dinner/brunch at a nice place without me. I expressed it made me uncomfortable and felt disrespectful especially considering they were staying here. This continued to happen with every visit. I expressed my increasing discomfort and anger with each occurrence.

Cue current visit. They are to be here in our home from Thursday-Tuesday.

After work, at 7:45 I go out to the deck for a smoke and to decompress. 8:25PM MIL comes to the deck and tells me dinner reservation is at 8:30 and to get ready.

No one told me anything? I go upstairs and wife is getting ready in a room. I pop in and incredulously ask her why she didn't tell me about dinner?? Her response was:

""You could have asked, couldn't you?""

I tell her this is incredibly rude. She said this is about FIL's birthday. I go to my desk for more work and ask wife to let me know when she's done getting ready.

SIL and wife both pass behind me while getting wife ready not saying a word. I then hear them go downstairs and the front door closing. I go downstairs and they're gone. I called wife 4 times. No answer.

I am seething. I drive to cool off and get a call from wife 20min later.

139,1drt237,AITA about wanting to take a break from MIL,"My husband(33) and I have 2 young children (4)and (5). They have both been diagnosed as autistic. Since their birth MIL (61) has been very involved in their lives and our marriage. Our family life has been very challenging, but we were fortunate to have her help. 

However, back in September of last year I got a strange call from MIL explaining a scenario with her other grand children by the pool. The three teenagers were on their phones ignoring her and she wanted them to talk to her so she told me she said ""My autistic grandchildren talk more than you do."" Which my children didn't speak much at all at that point in time. 

One grandchild Amber(14) apparently scolded her and told her that what she said was wrong. MIL laughed on the phone saying she thought that Amber was way too sensitive and asked me don't you think what I said was funny. I told her that I didn't think it was funny and our family life is very challenging. I also told her I was very grateful that Amber stood up for her cousin's, and then I hung up. The call was followed by a very long apologetic text from MIL. 

It was shortly after that talking to my husband, and his siblings that they told me this is MIL's sense of humor, and she's talked about our children like this in the past. But they emphasized that I had to forgive her and just let it go. 

At that point in time life was so stressful and I felt so betrayed by MIL. I told her our family was taking an extended break from her. She was very upset, and only my husband has been to see MIL in the months that followed.but stopped visiting her the past two months. My children and I have not seen her or spoken with her since September of last year.

My husband and I have been heartbroken from the fallout, but he understands where I'm coming from. We had also been in counseling the past six months,and our marriage has never been better. Our therapist was helping us strategize how to try to make amends with MIL. Until recently, a police officer came by our home to do a welfare check on my husband and children. My husband reached out to MIL, but only FIL(64) answered saying we think your being abused we've retained a lawyer if you are ready to divorce your wife. 

We're both very upset, and are cosidering some kind of legal action. At this point in time I would like to take a break from MIL indefinitely.

And Jessica grabbed Becky's belly and jiggled it. I was horrified especially knowing that Jessica had a weight problem growing up. Jessica guessed Becky's weight to be around 300 lb but Becky corrected to her say 259 lb. And this part is personally hard to admit but I am almost as heavy as Becky, as I am 248 lb myself.. At lunch Jessica kept making remakes about how much Becky must have been eating to gain the weight. Jenn and Bob just sat there and let this happen.

I didn’t want to say no because he doesn’t have games at his house, and only plays whenever he’s at a friend’s house. Anyway, he scrolled through all the Roblox games and saw one of a Chicken Nugget singing Cotton Eye Joe (which is complete brainrot btw,) and he really wanted to play it.


Since he was playing absolute garbage and since he was begging me so bad to let me give him the computer, I hid it under the couch when he was away, and told him that I lost it and that I think I put it in some drawer, and he was so upset.

147,1drsd52,AITA For Making a Bad Joke to my In-laws ,"I (23M) and my wife (22F) have been married for two years. It’s been pretty good, except her in-laws HATE me. Tim (26F) is my wife’s half-sister and is very protective of her. Tim has hated me since day one and threatened bodily harm on multiple occasions. I’vs tried to tell my wife that I don’t feel safe going to the in-laws’ house any more, but she just laughs and waves it off. Her father (47M) despises me as well. He’s thoroughly convinced I’m gay and has chased me around with a shotgun for “leading on” his daughter. My wife had to step in multiple times to prevent him from causing serious injury. She admits that her father has gone seriously off the rails but refuses to do anything about it. 

About eight months ago, we had the in-laws over to my family home for Thanksgiving dinner. My father died before I was born, so it was just my mother (53F) hosting. She made an offhand comment about if we wanted children in the future, saying “Are you going to give us grandchildren anytime soon?” My father-in-law snorted into his mashed potatoes and said. “Gretchen, your son is one of those homosexuals. He isn’t giving my sweet baby girl grandchildren anytime soon.” My wife appeared extremely uncomfortable with the conversation and excused herself from the table soon after.

 My mother appeared distraught and trotted off into the kitchen, leaving me with the in-laws. Tim smirked at me from across the table said, “You probably have a small dick, too. No wonder my sister isn’t pregnant yet.” I, finally tired with Tim’s harassment, snapped at her and said, “For someone who doesn’t have a dick and doesn’t have a man, you sure seem to talk about them a lot.” Tim’s face turned a bright shade of red and she angrily hurled mashed potatoes across the table. She sarcastically retaliated, “Yeah, sure. I’m jealous of your dick.”

All the frustration of having such a nasty person for an in-law finally spilled over and I realized I had the setup for a dad joke of epic proportions. “Hi, jealous. I’m Jacob.” She turned a fabulous shade of purple and threatened to chop off my dick and throw it in the blender. Tim was shrieking and hollering so loudly that my wife came back in to ask what was wrong. When she came in, Tim started blubbering and complaining to her younger sister, saying, “Why did you marry this failure of a man?” My wife, understandably, was confused and upset, so after everyone went to bed, she asked what happened. When I told her, she got angry at me. She thinks I shouldn’t have provoked them even if they were being rude to me and that the dad joke was inappropriate.

151,1drs5y1,AITA for convincing my friend he was talking to his dead mom?,"So this happened recently and im feeling pretty conflicted about the situation. My best friend Jordan (M17) lost his mom tragically last year due to a horrible car accident, and has been struggling to cope ever since.

One night, Jordan and I were hanging out and he started talking about how much he missed his mom, so I jokingly suggested to use my Oujia board to “communicate” with her. (neither of us believed they worked.) Surprisingly Jordan agreed to using the board, I asked if he was serious and he said he was, so we used it.

We were using it for about 3 minutes and of course it didn’t work, and I could see the disappointment on my friends face, I felt horrible that I even suggested this, and worse about what I did next.

I started spelling out messages only he, his mum very few people would know. (For example, her childhood nickname for him).

 He told me to stop messing around and that he knew I was doing it, I swore on his mother’s grave that it wasn’t me. (Not my best moment, I know.)

We kept going for about 10 more minutes and I guess he began to believe that it really was his mom, as he got emotional. He was crying and telling her how much he misses her, so I had to put it to an end. His ‘mom’ said goodbye to him and we packed the board away.

I knew I had gone too far and it was too late to say anything without destroying our friendship completely. 

But here’s the thing:  he now seems more at peace and grateful for being able to find “closure”. My intention was only ever to try and bring him a sense of peace, though I didn’t plan to go about it this way.

Despite how much better he’s doing now, I still feel an incredible sense of guilt. I took advantage of such a sensitive moment, and now this lie is always going to hang over my friendship with him. It’s eating away at me, but I don’t think I could ever tell him. I don’t know what to do.

So my issue is I have been BEGGGGGGING to take a trip with her just us, something we plan and look forward to. I told her it doesnt even have to be a trip. I told her Id love to go to a concert, go kayaking, to a football game, go watch a stand up, etc. Literally anything. These are all things that she does with her friends. But the rare times she suggests to do something I feel like she is only asking me to join because Ive been telling her I want to do something with her so badly. Also her big excuse is she can't just take a trip because she cant take time off work.

SO this leads me to just last weekend she is sitting right next to me on the phone with her dad and I hear her tell him that she is going to go visit her friend who lives on the other side of the country at the end of July. When she got off the phone I was pretty quiet because I was stunned a bit and to be honest I was jealous. So she asked why I went from being chipper to quiet. I told her I was shocked hearing about her going on this trip and told her that I would have thought she would have told me. (Again I want to put an emphasis on I don't care if she takes a trip without me I just feel odd that she never wants to do anything with me.) But when I told her I was shocked she started back peddeling and said her plan was for her and I to both go. I told her that it would be fun (which it would be fun) but I told her that I need to plan for these things more than 4 weeks in advance. Along with I told her its upsetting that we dont do anything that we both plan. The conversation didn't go much further than that.

But today she starts planning our flights, and our schedule (her plan is for her to pay her portion and me to pay mine). But I got so flustered that I asked if we could talk tomorrow about it. Like Im so frustrated because she didnt ask if I could take the time off work, if I could budget for this, etc. ALONG with her whole reason for her and I not doing stuff is she cant take time off work. 

Also I want to say she is hounding me to ""put a ring on it"" but I haven't because I have a handful of concerns that I want us to work on. I say this because this is A HUGE ONE OF THE CONCERNS lol.

I told her I was shocked hearing about her going on this trip and told her that I would have thought she would have told me. (Again I want to put an emphasis on I don't care if she takes a trip without me I just feel odd that she never wants to do anything with me.) But when I told her I was shocked she started back peddeling and said her plan was for her and I to both go. I told her that it would be fun (which it would be fun) but I told her that I need to plan for these things more than 4 weeks in advance. Along with I told her its upsetting that we dont do anything that we both plan. The conversation didn't go much further than that.

But today she starts planning our flights, and our schedule (her plan is for her to pay her portion and me to pay mine). But I got so flustered that I asked if we could talk tomorrow about it. Like Im so frustrated because she didnt ask if I could take the time off work, if I could budget for this, etc. ALONG with her whole reason for her and I not doing stuff is she cant take time off work. 

Also I want to say she is hounding me to ""put a ring on it"" but I haven't because I have a handful of concerns that I want us to work on. I say this because this is A HUGE ONE OF THE CONCERNS lol. Like I see this is a huge part of finances and I want to have mutual financial goals together. So WIBTA if I told her tomorrow we aren't going on this trip? ",0.0,0.9578957557678223,1,0

After my dad had died my mom and family had been struggling, my mom got sick and blind so they came to help. When they first came me and my sister welcomed them with open arms, they acted super nice and me and my cousin who we’re gonna call Veronica became great friends. I even showed her to my friends and she became part of the group. Than we started to notice every time we went to the store she will steal something, she also had a horrible background of drug addiction and $uicidal tendencies. She even went to a mental hospital and just for your information she is 15. Her brother has autism yet they let him do whatever they want, even one time he touched my leg very inappropriately and chased me upstairs to the bathroom. I locked the door and he started to bang the door and laugh. I told his mom and mine as well yet they didn’t care at all cause he has autism. Another time was when I was in my balcony he came up to me and peed infornt of me outside the balcony. He had a disgusting smile as he happily shows me his area. I was disgusted, he did it 2 times and all they did was laugh it off, I’m the same age as Veronica, I was younger when the happened. Moving back to Veronica she used to drug herself in my house even one time she took my medication when I was running a high fever, I’m very sensitive so most of the time I get taken to the hospital because of a fever.

155,1drrivk,"AITA for telling my ""boss"" that I don't take orders from her?","I've been an executive assistant to three managers for the last five years at an entertainment agency. I always had a hybrid schedule to compensate for not being able to take time off and for having to work when I do take time off. My bosses rarely come in the office anyways and I get my work done just as quickly at home as I do in the office. The difference is not having to spend two hours a day in traffic.

A few months ago, we merged with a new company. Everything is the same except that now my ""direct"" supervisor is someone named ""Linda"" isn't a manager but an administrative person at the new companythat we merged with. However, the managers outrank her and I still work with the same managers.

Linda was not okay with my WFH a few days a week. I told her there was no way I would stay if I had to come into the office five days a week. I also told her that I already got approvals from the three managers to keep my hybrid schedule and there's nothing she can do about it.

The managers are going to be out next week for the holiday so I planned on WFH all next week. I won't have much to do with them gone but I can't take time off if they're out. 

Linda asked me if I was working next week and I said yes although the managers are not. She said that was great because she had several projects for me and other EA desks to cover since other EAs would be taking time off.

I said I am not coming into the office next week. I am WFH. Next week will be the closest thing to a vacation that I will have all year and I'm not wasting it by coming into the office. That's not fair that I can't take time off but I also have to provide coverage so other people can take time off. 

She said that she was still my direct supervisor. I said yes, but the managers have final say and until they say I can't WFH, then I'm WFH. I also reminded her that the managers outrank her so I'm going to do what they want me to do as I have done for the last five years. Not her. 

She said she was going to be overwhelmed with so many admin out next week and needed the help. I said that's not my problem.

She can't do anything against me. She has to run everything through the managers. She's basically the middle woman between the admin and managers but me and the managers already had a direct relationship long before the merge. 

Edit: Linda's job is to make sure the managers are happy with their admin. My managers are very happy with me. I work my ass off so much that they don't need to come into the office. So it's not like Linda can complain to them about me and she knows this.

I can take time off but essentially have no coverage. My managers have things come up all the time. They don't know how to reschedule a zoom or set up a conference call and don't want to answer their phones. I'll happily put in a few hours on my day off and they won't say anything about my picking up a few OT hours a week (my OT rate is $50 an hour!) or coming and going as I please.

Yes, I'm being taken advantage of but I'm taking advantage of things too. 

Also, I don't work under a contract and I'm a male.

Edit: Pretty much anything admin is ran through Linda BUT Linda has to run everything through the managers. So it's not like she can say that I can't WFH or fire me. If she had that power then I'd definitely would had been fired already.

156,1drre46,AITA for asking my husband if he had been drinking?,"Background: my husband and I have been together for about 14 years. He has a drinking problem that has escalated over these years. He is a chef, so he works a lot of hours, he’s always stressed, and he’s always around alcohol. 

Since we’ve been together, he has had 5 different jobs. Typically when he starts the job everything is fine, but then he starts to get stressed/ overworked and starts to drink at work to cope. This gets worse, as you can imagine, and causes problems at his jobs. He has been fired twice and the most recent time was for drinking while working… he even went to rehab to try to save his job (and himself), but continues to drink. While that was the only time he got fired specifically for drinking on the job, he has had write ups for things related to drinking, such as angry outbursts. Whether or not his other jobs knew he drank on the job, I’m not sure, but I highly suspect that they did. With the two jobs he didn’t get fired from, it seemed almost like a mutual situation where he was ready to leave and they weren’t fighting to keep him. Every time he starts a new job I beg him not to drink while he’s working, he starts by promising he won’t, but inevitably has never kept that promise.

Anyhow, he started a job about 7 months ago  and swears he doesn’t drink until he leaves work (he stops at a nearby gas station and gets beer for the drive home). He called me when he got off of work the other night, and I could tell right away by the way he was talking to me that he had been drinking. Because we’ve been together so long I pick up on this easily, and he’s kind of an asshole when he drinks so that’s my first clue. So I ask (calmly) ‘have you been drinking?’ He immediately gets mad, says he has to go, then comes home and yells at me because he didn’t like my ‘tone’ (I swear I did not have a tone and just asked in a calm manner). This was days ago and we haven’t talked since. 

Based on his history with alcohol, I have constant anxiety about him drinking while working. I think him being open and honest would help quell that anxiety, but he gets extremely agitated if I bring it up.

157,1drr9bb,AITA for spending a work event with a coworker of my bf instead of him?,"I apologize in advance for my awful English, not my mother tongue.

I (26F) have been in a relationship with Teddy (24M) for three years. We have some problems, as couples do, but until recently, I never thought about them as obstacles. One main problem is his communication skills: he can be rude without realizing and is just cold in general. 

Two weeks ago, Teddy brought me to 2 events at his job and I met some of his colleagues. The team is very cohesive, they have their own inside jokes and social code, so I was quite nervous to go as I was the only “outsider” (it was events for the work team only, no partner was supposed to be there, I just went because Teddy was in the organisation team and I wanted to support him). Also, as I said, Teddy never stays with me when I meet people he knows so I have to meet people myself.

Fortunately, his colleagues were very nice to me. During both events, I didn’t see Teddy at all, like I said. So, I stayed with one of them, John (29M). John was the nicest of all. We had a lot in common, including our sense of humour: very childish teasing with friendly negging. He saw that I was nervous when I arrived, so he stayed with me non-stop, explained things to me, etc. The shitstorm started at the end of the second event. Here are the main things that happened : I had a stain on my top, John told me and I washed it. No biggy. I left for half an hour with three coworkers of Teddy (including John) to buy some missing stuff. John and I stayed in the kitchen chatting for an hour, then played with the company dog together. As I said, I spent the event with John more than Teddy.

But then, Teddy started to make few jokes about John looking at my tits. He also started making remarks about us being “tactile” (it was only friendly teasing, like poking each other faces randomly to annoy each other, and he catch me once because I tripped), very loudly in front of everyone. John ultimately started to feel uncomfortable and stopped talking to me completely (he explained later than he didn’t want to create any issue between my bf and me). I ended up all alone and very uncomfortable. I talked to Teddy about it and he said he was not jealous at all, he just thought the situation was funny. To “make amends” he went to talk to John to ‘reassure him that there were no problem”, but then, IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, went “don’t worry bro, I don’t care, I understand you want to look at this, she hot \*waves at my breast and butt and laughs\*”. Everything became awkward, I felt like the “hot slutty gf” who “may cheat and need to be watch”, even though I was only friendly with John. I hid in the toilets for another hour because I could not meet eyes with anyone. We left shortly after. I barely said bye to John, and we didn’t exchange contacts.

 

Since then, I am extremely upset with Teddy. I felt objectified and I really don't see how my relationship with John was inappropriate.

158,1drr97b,AITA for being stern with a child that isn’t mine?,"So I have this niece, (2f) who is, well, spoiled.  Her grandma had custody the first 20-ish months of her life, and grandma is a pushover and lets her have whatever she wants. 

Her mom got custody back 4-5 months ago and and is even worse.  Probably out of guilt and making up for the the issues that led to her not having custody.  This toddler gets everything she wants.  If mom or grandma ever tell her “no” she’ll throw a tantrum and they will give in every time.  I tend to mind my business because “not my child not my problem”. 

Now this child does spend a lot of time with us as we try to support her and her mom as best as possible in the circumstances, and my kids treat her like a little sister.  She’s actually a bright young girl with a great vocabulary for her age and a fiery tude. They were over today, as I was getting ready for a camping trip.  I was going in and out of the shed, which my kids understand is off limits due to tools/nails/etc.  usually it’s locked but I was in and out taking camping/fishing gear to the truck.  

The niece started walking into the shed, I softly told her no, lots of sharps and owies, and redirected to the trampoline.  I explained to her mom the child needs to stay out of the shed. This happened 2 more times over the course of the next 15 minutes, same thing.  

Then, I had just dropped a container of fish hooks that went scattering everywhere and niece starts waddling into the shed, barefoot.  
I said firmly, “no, you can’t come in here” and she stopped her little foot and kept walking in so I gave her a VERY stern “STOP RIGHT NOW”. She looked at me with wide eyes then started crying and ran to her mom having an absolute meltdown.  I didn’t yell but was said it very sternly with a raised voice, and I don’t think anyone has ever been stern with her like that before. 

I explained to everyone the fishhook situation but mom left about 5 minutes later and then texted my wife saying she’s uncomfortable with me now because “I was mean and bullied her daughter” and it’s not my place to discipline *her* daughter. 

As far as I’m concerned I saved her a trip to the ER but my wife also thinks I could have more calmly redirected the child and wants me to apologize.  And I’ll admit I was already kind of grumpy already and probably could have dropped what I had in my hands and rushed over to pick her up, but still think it’s not my fault everyone else in her life is a massive pushover.

159,1drr2k1,AITA for not picking up my long distance partner from an airport far away? ,"I really need some advice. My partner and I have been doing long distance for two years. They recently moved pretty far for their job, and now we have to fly to see each other. 

My partner likes to fly into an airport that is an hour and 15 minutes away from my house, but it’s located in an urban area which often has heavy traffic, typically making the drive upwards of 2 hours each way. 

There’s a much closer airport that’s about 30 minutes or less from my house, but my partner doesn’t like flying into that one since there are no direct flights thus making the flights more expensive and longer with connecting flights. I offered to pay for an uber for them if they like to fly into the airport that is further away, but they got very upset. They told me people should pick up their loved ones from the airport no matter what, and it was one of their pet peeves when people don’t. It’s not that I don’t love them enough to drive the two hours, it’s that driving in heavy traffic is often stressful for me. I’m also a graduate student with limited time, often balancing studying, my day-time job, and showing up for my partner all at the same time. 

Any advice? ",Not the A-hole,2024-06-30,"AITA for not picking up my long distance partner from an airport far away?  I really need some advice. My partner and I have been doing long distance for two years. They recently moved pretty far for their job, and now we have to fly to see each other. 

My partner likes to fly into an airport that is an hour and 15 minutes away from my house, but it’s located in an urban area which often has heavy traffic, typically making the drive upwards of 2 hours each way. 

There’s a much closer airport that’s about 30 minutes or less from my house, but my partner doesn’t like flying into that one since there are no direct flights thus making the flights more expensive and longer with connecting flights. I offered to pay for an uber for them if they like to fly into the airport that is further away, but they got very upset. They told me people should pick up their loved ones from the airport no matter what, and it was one of their pet peeves when people don’t.

160,1drr2fn,AITA for going against my dad whish for me to marry?,"So basically I (19m) and my dad (50m) have gotten into a fight. He wants me to marry this girl that he and my mom really like. They are close with the family. Now it wouldn't be for another year or two she 21 and has told her parents that she would only agree if she is finished with school. But I don't want to get married at all and I have told my dad this but he would never really hear it. He keeps saying that once I meet her it would all change. 

So they set us on a date to meet( this happened a year ago). Now she's an ok person but I don't really like her. After the date i kind of thought she would say they same, but she didn't. She told her dad that she likes me and that he made a good choice. After my dad heard that he would not hear me out on how I was feeling. So at the time i just got over it and lived with the fact that I have to marry her.

But I meet this guy in college and well we have been togetherish for some time. When I came back home from school I brought up the marriage again. Which started a fight and my dad was saying that not getting married would hurt their reputation. He called me an ahole for lying about being ok with it. 

So I left the house and now I'm think of it all i feel bad because I did say I would go through with it and now i do feel like an ahole.",Not the A-hole,2024-06-30,"AITA for going against my dad whish for me to marry?

161,1drr21d,AITA for ordering a camera off of amazon without “consulting” my dad?,"I 18F recently graduated high school and during my graduation party i got a 500 dollar gift card for Amazon from my grandparents with a card saying “you can buy your camera for college now and not have to worry”

So i got home from the party and my parents stayed there, and i went and ordered the camera along with a few other things along side it. I triple checked and researched the camera before actually buying it and it checked out for what i needed for my class at school. And if for some reason it’s not what i need i can return it and get a different one.

My father was extremely pissed that I would buy the camera without him looking it over (he doesn’t like ordering things online at all and believes everything on there to be a scam) i haven’t said anything to him about it directly because he reacts this way even if we’re buying something small (like stickers) 

My mom told me not to worry about it and to just relax, but I’m just upset that he reacted the way he did when my grandparents told me specifically to order the camera- it was in the card they gave me.  It makes me feel like i did something horrible with the way he’s reacted and responded to this.

162,1drqw98,AITA for starting a fight over Disneyland?,"I (18M) planned a trip to Disneyland a month ago and asked both of my parents for permission. Despite their initial ""maybe,"" I interpreted it as a yes. When it came time to buy the ticket, I paid for it myself to avoid any last-minute objections. My mom pressured me to tell my dad, which led to an argument where he denied permission because I hadn't worked with him in his landscaping business.

Today, I overheard him planning to use/exchange $100 bills for smaller ones from my graduation money without asking me. This upset me because he often accuses me of disrespect despite the hardships I've endured, like not having my own room until I was 16. When I confronted him, he got angry and dismissed my concerns, saying my mom makes decisions in the house.

This sparked a fight where my mom sided with him, leading me to point out their inconsistent parenting and lack of respect. It's not just about money; their conservative views on my sexuality have caused me depression in the past.
