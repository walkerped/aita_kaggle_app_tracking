0,1ds8m7p,AITA for telling my stepdad to respect me?,"I'm a 17 year old male. My stepfather, 60M, is very religious and conservative when it comes to tradition. This, while we do have opposite views, never really got in the way of our relationship. We weren't super close yet we also weren't enemies. 

It wasn't until last night when my step sister, let's call her M (30F) came over to visit. M and my stepdad somehow got into an argument about politics. He was always talking and complaining about politics, so I was used to this. After a bit, I decided to join in and just listen. They would then ask me questions and I'd have my input, which was always the opposite of what my stepfather thought. This went on for about an hour or two before things became personal, my stepfather admitting he believes I will be going to hell if I don't accept Jesus Christ as my Savior and for being trans and openly gay. 

I told him that I do not believe in God. That turned into a whole other new thing since he never knew until then. He was saying how his point of view on religion is the true answer and how if I want to make it to Heaven, I need to repent more or less. I told him how can I if I don't believe in Heaven or Hell? And why should it affect his relationship with me, just because I'm not religious? I told him all I ever wanted was him to respect my choices. I made it clear this doesn't mean he has to like it, just to respect it. He then says ""Oh, well I'm sorry... I'm sorry that you don't accept God."" I was dumbfounded. I told him this is why I don't go to him for much, of which he then begins to blame my biological mother, saying how I never touched a church in my life (I grew up catholic, went to a child's Catholic sunday school, and worked at a Catholic church for kids.) 

After all of that, he left the room out of silence after I kept telling him how it shouldn't matter if he agrees with me on this or not and he should just respect it. It's the next day and I now can't help but feel bad. Did I go too far? 

For context, I have been out for 4 years now and I knew his views on my lifestyle. He always fought with my mom about it, saying how I'm going to Hell and my mom shouldn't be okay with that.

1,1drzmvj,UPDATE AITA for taking my stepson on outings without my son?,"[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dq56vb/aita_for_taking_my_stepson_on_outings_without_my/)

First of all I want to thank everyone who gave comments. I felt some of the comments and messages I received were judgemental and hurtful, but accepted that most people seemed to think I was the Asshole in the situation, so rather than defend myself my priority was to make things right with my son Mark.

I spoke to him and opened up by telling him how much I loved him and how I wouldn't change anything about him, and that he inherited all of the qualities I loved so much about his mother. He seemed pretty confused when I said that and said he really appreciated it but asked where it was coming from.

I told him that I heard that he was getting jealous about the time I was spending with Luke 1 on 1, and that I'd hate for him to think or feel that I was abandoning him by spending time with Luke. He then had a bit of an embarrassed look on his face and reassured me that he didn't feel abandoned or jealous of Luke. I then mentioned how May said otherwise, and he then visibly cringe.

He then told me that he was jealous, but of me rather than Luke. That he thought Luke was incredibly nice to him when they first met and was really excited to have a friend like him since most of his friends through his school and clubs are girls. That he'd like to spend more time hanging out just the two of them, but he's much interested in hanging out with me rather than him.

I instantly felt relief about the situation, and asked if he's spoke to Luke about hanging out more, and he said that he hasn't as he didn't know what to ask to do or to come across as weird. I asked what they both had in common, and he said they liked similar video games, music and films/tv, so I offered to buy them both tickets to any upcoming film they'd both want to see and that if there are any upcoming concerts or gigs that they'd want to go to, that I'd buy them tickets if that's something they'd like.

Mark was really happy at that suggestion, as well as Luke and Laura. Especially Laura because Luke doesn't really have many friends and she was really worried about how he would get on if there was any blending of families. So turns out they were both wanting to be better friends with eachother but neither one wanted to express it out of fear of rejection from the other.",UPDATE,2024-06-30,"UPDATE AITA for taking my stepson on outings without my son?

throughout our relationship, it was rough. our relationship started due to a previous relationship of mine ending, and he instantly started lovebombing me and pushing the idea of getting together into my head no matter how many times i made it clear that i was trying to heal. i felt as if i couldn’t say no because he had already spent upwards to $600 on me
from the day we got together he made me share my location with him, as well as guilting me into sharing the password to all my accounts by sending me his and telling me it’s “just what couples do.” after he got my location, he would check it constantly and ask where i was and what i was doing. anytime i would go out with friends. though anytime he would go out with his friends, he would turn his location off, and “accidentally” send me pictures of him being uncomfortably close with his friends. then when i claim it made me uncomfortable he would say that i was being dramatic and then have his friends and family speak up and tell me that it’s “not a big deal.” making me feel crazy for being uncomfy 
he would yell, break things, shit talk people in my life, so on and so forth. leaving me isolated, i only had him, which led me to be genuinely brainwashed into thinking everything was okay. anytime we were in public i would be shamed or put down and controlled by him.

then, our relationship ended due to him ignoring me for girl he had met at work. the day we broke up he went out with her all day and stayed in a parking lot for 2 hours, ignoring my texts and calls. later that day he came over to my house, i set a boundary with him about it, he didn’t like it and we eventually broke up. he came out as straight 
thought out our relationship he would spread rumors and claim nasty things about his ex, so i brought up how i don’t want us to end on bad terms and how i would appreciate it if we just kept everything neutral since we had to see eachother for school and we share some friends. he then went on to tell me that if i “didn’t go say he was abusive or a bad person then he wouldn’t say bad things about me” which left a horrible taste in my mouth.
which i put two n two together and realized that was exactly what had happened to his ex who had claimed he was abusive. 

about a week later, he got with the girl that he had cheated on me with. as well as bad mouthed me to his friends. a decently large amount of alcohol later, i spoke up to one of our shared friends about everything he had done to me. his reaction was shocked. as well as everyone else in my life that i’ve spoken up to. with all that though, i’m second guessing if i was the asshole and i deserved what had happened to me and faced the consequences of my actions in the relationship.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-06-30,"AITAH in my past relationship?

6,1drpubj,AITA for blowing up at my director?,"Throwaway account; I (30M) an actor who works primarily in the dubbing scene. I play mostly bit parts, mainly side characters. I'm fine with it, truth be told- I've seen the stress of the job, and I kinda like having some privacy. Anyways, the main focus of the story is a pretty heated argument I got into with a director. This happened a while back, and something came up with that director, but I wanted to avoid stirring a pot so I've opted to post it now. Reflecting on it tells me I'm the jerk, but I wanted to get some feedback.

Director has always been a pretty harsh person; they're on the older side, and have admittedly played a few big parts in some pretty cool anime from here and there. However, they are horribly irritable and passive aggressive to others. They used to be a pretty big deal, but now they've settled for being a director. I have heard and even SEEN actors who have worked with them in the past, and they spared no detail of them being a pretty fucking awful person. I saw make a guy I'm friends with nearly cry in the booth because of them being way too harsh. Thankfully, I usually work with some of the more 'chill' and younger directors, but whenever they were in the studio, it was...tense, for lack of a better word.

So, we were recording for a pretty big project that came out recently; and unfortunately, because that project was big, they opted for this director to take the helm. I was cast as some extras in the project, people you'd probably barely notice. Day of recording, I was out of it due to some personal troubles and lack of sleep. I'm usually a friendly person, but today I was just so hair trigger ready to pounce from any sort of issue. I wasn't putting 100% into my lines, something the director picked up on.

They started chewing me out; stuff like ""young people think they can do anything, huh"" and ""are you really SURE this is the job you want"". I had enough of it, and started telling them off, calling them a whole load of things- I called them a witch, a horrible director, and that I didn't care who or what they voiced in- I was just out of it today. If she was expecting an Oscar nominated performance from a character who maybe had ten lines in total, then her bar is way too high. Director was pretty stunned by my reaction, and I quickly came to my senses after yelling. I didn't know what else to do, so I just finished up recording my takes, and quickly ran out.

On her last day here (about a week ago), she said she’d like to get dinner together. Dinner in this case meant getting the food and then bringing it home to eat.

This conversation happened around 2-3 in the afternoon. 6-7 rolls around, I ask what we’re feeling - my mother and grandmother are undecided. At around 8-8:30 ish, madre comes saying okay, we’re going. “Going where?” To fetch dinner. I say no, I have work tomorrow and I go to bed at 9 (I work full time 8-5). She says that I knew this (dinner) was coming, I have a duty to my family, and that it’s my grandmothers last day over. I say I’m not risking my job (recently started, fairly intense) by being late because I overslept, and that I can’t. 

Standing in my doorway, she proceeds to call me a disappointment, then a disappointment to specifically my family, that if I wasn’t going to act like a part of this family I wouldn’t be a part of this family, useless, and some more.  I said I wasn’t asking for anything unreasonable. She said she’s risked so much at her job for her family. I agreed but said that she, like me, would not risk her job to get L&L Barbecue takeout. My response wasn’t received well. 

My mother and father (he wasn’t present for her “speech”) then went to get the food, and while they were gone I left to stay with my boyfriend for the night. Before I left, I did talk to my grandmother and apologized that I wouldn’t be there for dinner, but that to keep things civil, it was probably best for me to not be present at the moment.

9,1drpbi5,AITA For Calling Police on My Neighbors?,"I (22F) live in an okay neighborhood with my Mom (62F) and Aunt (68F). It's carved up between slumlord rentals and homeowners so we either have to involve police for domestic affairs or handle it ourselves. I try not to get involved with anything since domestic affairs range from the sleazeball across the street kicking out the girlfriend of the week to drag racing to drug deals (nothing serious in the past few years, just weed and maybe mushrooms).

We've had a problem with extremely loud music the past year. Like the walls shake and you can hear it a block away. I know of three parties that do this. One is my neighbor (28M) and his friends across the street who insist on parking in the empty lot by our house. They work late and will pull up at 1 AM blasting shitty country and rock for five minutes and go to bed. The second is a family that has sporadic parties and they live one block away. These parties are random and last between noon to well into morning with nonstop music.

The straw that broke the camel's back for me was my neighbor (27F) who also lives with her mom (61F). I've talked with her about her music and dog. I have chronic migraines and both are aware of it. She'll sit in her car at night blasting music and smoking weed. The neighbor who moved in a year ago (35M) has started retaliating with his own music whenever she does this or her dog is outside barking, which is always. This has been my life for three months now.

I'm tired of having a migraine every day and I can't keep popping ibuprofen and Excedrin like candy. My vision has started to be affected by the migraines when I only had the head pains. I can't sleep. I work from home and my work has been significantly impacted. I've resorted to calling the police (nonemergency line) whenever they do this. I don't care who it is or what but I give grace of 15 minutes if I can physically feel the music and an hour if it's just my head starting to throb. I understand people are entitled to having fun in their house, but this has gotten ridiculous.

My Mom works with police (not in law enforcement but deals with them frequently enough) and says this is a waste of resources and their time. She's also worried about 27F losing her job at the county jail and her Mom getting upset since they're friends. Not necessarily at us, but just the whole situation. My Mom insists others should be calling if I am so I should lay off so they can take the heat but I've never had to give my name or information. I don't know what else to do and feel like I'm going crazy from the music or being gaslit that this is normal. AITA?

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: These people are the only consistently loud ones. 90% of the loudness has come from 3 of the 4 people and has increased recently in the past three months and was already consistently loud for a year. The other 10% from your general passing cars with loud motors, construction, and such which is fine and reasonable! I don't mind parties or loud things and don't expect it to be quiet 24/7, but I also don't expect it to be loud 24/7. We've never been a loud neighborhood in the 20 years I've lived here and police have been responding since the noise ordinance is heavily enforced. I checked my NextDoor app to see if anyone else said anything and others have begun calling too. I'm also aware of the noise ordinance and have been following the guidelines.

11,1drp8u7,AITA for confiding in a superior?,"I was part of a project for a few weeks. There were 8 of us on the team from a few different offices, 7 female + 1 guy. A week into the project, I found out from coworker A that the guy (B) has been harassing coworker C. I immediately wished she hadn’t told me because 1. sitting idly by while B harasses C isn’t easy, especially when C doesn’t know I know, 2. it was a violation of C’s trust, & 3. I knew this man is in the process of transferring to a new location & it made me wonder if he was acting shady at his old location.

C said she didn’t want to get HR involved, as told by A, even as harassment continued.

Well, our project ended last week. I couldn’t find anywhere on our company site to submit an anonymous complaint - which would have been simply “B is acting unprofessionally & harassing female coworkers”. That way, nobody was named & it would be a red flag on his file if something has happened before or happens in the future.

I asked a superior, in confidence, where to submit an *anonymous* complaint. Emphasis on the ANONYMOUS. She was digging for information, so finally I said, “B has been harassing C.” That’s it. I know revealing that info is likely what makes me TA. The superior said she would look into it & get back to me.

What she did *instead* was CALL TEAMMATE A, who was in charge of our team, & *ask her why she hadn’t said anything*. So A calls me up & said she wishes I hadn’t said anything & I don’t have all the details & how C wanted to say something herself if she said anything, etc. I clarified & said I didn’t say anything about any details, & that I had stressed to our supervisor that I wanted it to be *anonymous*, & how I should have said it didn’t matter why when she kept asking.

A little bit later, my supervisor texted me & said, “I took care of it for you. Your name is down as a witness. This is what I replied:

“I really, truly wanted my complaint to be anonymous. The only reason I asked in confidence is because I couldn’t find anything online. I had no plans of mentioning C’s name, only that B was being unprofessional & making people feel uncomfortable so that it would be a red flag on his file if he’d done it before or anyone came forward in the future. Especially because I never witnessed anything. The only info I have is because I got it secondhand. I apologize if I put you in a position where you felt like you needed to take it further than providing the information for an anonymous complaint. I shouldn’t have revealed any identifying information about anyone.“

She replied, “Don’t apologize. When you said you witnessed it, I had to make sure she felt safe and supported.”

I said, “I feel like I must, especially if anything I said gave the impression I witnessed anything,” BECAUSE I DIDN’T.

14,1drox8q,WIBTA if I asked my flatmate’s partner to cover a larger part of her rent than me and my GF?,"Okay, vital context: I (21) live with my gf (22), my gf’s sister (27) and her gf (23). We pay £2200 for a house and the agreement when we moved in was that we’d all pay £550 each as all of us have about the same financial situation. Bills were to be split evenly too.

Basically, when we moved in we were 99% that gf sister’s gf (let’s call her H) would be able to pay her part of the rent whether she was employed or not because of the benefit system here in the UK. She’s been unemployed for a couple months because the company she’s been working with decided to shut down her store entirely and revamp it with an entirely new staff. Since then, she’s been claiming that her mental health is simply not good enough to find work, and we all understood. However, when we said it was okay for her to take her time, we also thought she’d be getting the entirety of her side of her rent through benefit, but due to some circumstances outside of our control, she will not be able to claim it. So, essentially, we have been splitting the rent three ways instead of four for the last three months. This has been straining all of our financial situations, and has been making us pretty short on money even for food.

Because my gf and I have certain plans we want to save up money for, I brought it up with her that we should probably ask her sister to cover a little more of H’s rent than us for the meantime in which she cannot provide for herself at all. I said I’d be happy to pay maybe about £100-150 more a month, but not entire £200 and especially if H’s unemployment length is indefinite. Gf’s sister would have to cover what H cannot, and my gf agreed that this would be a good plan as, although we’d still be helping out as best we can when even we don’t have much in this living crisis, we wouldn’t be feeling the need to skip meals just to travel to and from work. 

When I hinted this idea at gf’s sister, she seemed to take it entirely personal and went off about how you'd never do that to friends and that we should all be supporting each other. However, half a year ago when I was unemployed due to severe anxiety disorder issues, neither one of them seemed to be happy to step up and cover my side
of the rent while I got back up on my feet. So then my question is, WIBTA if I asked my gf's sister to cover a larger portion of her GF's rent because neither me nor my gf can afford to continue overpaying by £200-250?


EDIT:

I’m getting a lot of very helpful advice here and I am glad that everyone so far has agreed with me that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to cover for H. However, some of you aren’t quite understanding the big picture as much as you agree with me, so let me explain:

H and gf’s sister are FAMILY. In no way would I ever want H to live on the streets even if she can’t pay her bills, nor would I want gf’s sister to be in financial hell because she’s covering double the rent on a low salary, which is why I want to help them BOTH. The four of us have a lot of history, a lot of things we’ve gotten through together, and the relationship is better than just “you can’t get a job and pay? oof, sorry bro, move tf out.” If it was as easy as that I wouldn’t be on reddit asking for advice. The only issue I’ve struggled with is mainly finding a way to make sure that I am NOT putting myself in shit to cover someone else who could probably find different ways to figure it out.

However, when we said it was okay for her to take her time, we also thought she’d be getting the entirety of her side of her rent through benefit, but due to some circumstances outside of our control, she will not be able to claim it. So, essentially, we have been splitting the rent three ways instead of four for the last three months. This has been straining all of our financial situations, and has been making us pretty short on money even for food.

Because my gf and I have certain plans we want to save up money for, I brought it up with her that we should probably ask her sister to cover a little more of H’s rent than us for the meantime in which she cannot provide for herself at all. I said I’d be happy to pay maybe about £100-150 more a month, but not entire £200 and especially if H’s unemployment length is indefinite. Gf’s sister would have to cover what H cannot, and my gf agreed that this would be a good plan as, although we’d still be helping out as best we can when even we don’t have much in this living crisis, we wouldn’t be feeling the need to skip meals just to travel to and from work. 

When I hinted this idea at gf’s sister, she seemed to take it entirely personal and went off about how you'd never do that to friends and that we should all be supporting each other. However, half a year ago when I was unemployed due to severe anxiety disorder issues, neither one of them seemed to be happy to step up and cover my side
of the rent while I got back up on my feet. So then my question is, WIBTA if I asked my gf's sister to cover a larger portion of her GF's rent because neither me nor my gf can afford to continue overpaying by £200-250?


EDIT:

I’m getting a lot of very helpful advice here and I am glad that everyone so far has agreed with me that it shouldn’t be my responsibility to cover for H. However, some of you aren’t quite understanding the big picture as much as you agree with me, so let me explain:

H and gf’s sister are FAMILY. In no way would I ever want H to live on the streets even if she can’t pay her bills, nor would I want gf’s sister to be in financial hell because she’s covering double the rent on a low salary, which is why I want to help them BOTH. The four of us have a lot of history, a lot of things we’ve gotten through together, and the relationship is better than just “you can’t get a job and pay? oof, sorry bro, move tf out.” If it was as easy as that I wouldn’t be on reddit asking for advice. The only issue I’ve struggled with is mainly finding a way to make sure that I am NOT putting myself in shit to cover someone else who could probably find different ways to figure it out.

16,1drooho,AITA if I’m bringing a kitten home without parents permission ,"important context: 
The kitten doesn’t have a home whilst all her siblings are being adopted, we have experience with cats so this isn’t new to the house. 
We already have a cat who is very social with other cats my area, we have 3 dogs who have no issues with cats and
 I have a job and already pay for current cats vetinary bills etc and have already booked appointments to get the cats vaccines and spaded in about 6 weeks 
I honestly don’t see the issue (which like ik is wrong i just have trouble seeing other perspectives) since i am paying and will have the time to take care of the kitten.
wanting to see other perspectives because I don’t wanna stress or upset my parents but i know they won’t agree so i’m just hoping to ask for forgiveness later ? 
Just won’t seeing what the best way to go about this is and what will cause the least amount of damage
