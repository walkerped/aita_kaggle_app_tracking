0,1dsuyz3,AITA for changing in the same bathroom as my bestie?,"For context, i am transgender (ftm) and have not medicaly transiond yet. I am still in school and i am not aloud to use any other bathroom than the girls bathroom. And my friend is bisexual and has a boyfriend. 

Me and my friend have weilding as an elective. There for, we have to change into weilding close everyday.
The shop has a single stalled restroom so to save time all the girls (and me cus i cant use the boys room.) change together in the one restroom. And so far my friends boyfried has not bat an eye at that once. 

But one day we were all running late and had no time to change back, me and my friend had the same class nect period and asked if the teacher if we could go change in the restrooms real quick and he was cool with it. These restrooms were the regualr restrooms with mutiliple stalls so we vhanged in different stalls.

When we got back my frieds boyfriend was mad at us. We asked why and he just said it was ""weird"" we told him that we litterally change together, infront of each other, everday. And asked why this time was different? He ended up just getting his friends to agree with him sayimg its wierd to change in a bathroom? Idk. He then brought up times that we acted ""gay"" with each other but we mentiond that he does the same shit too. *cough cough.. hyprocacy.* He couldnt really explain why he was mad, just that he didnt like her changing with me and calling us wierd.

1,1dsnuw1,AITA for fighting for my son to have my last name instead of his mom and her husband's?,"I (24m) have a 5 month old son with my ex (28f) and things are complicated af with her. We dated for 8 months. She left me for her ex and didn't tell me she was pregnant. It was her sister who told me and she told me the baby was mine and my ex knew about it. I reached out and told her I wanted to be a parent to my kid. She retaliated by marrying her ex and they told me *he* was going to be the father. I told them I would file with the courts when the baby was born to establish DNA and custody. My son was born, they did everything to keep me away including adding her husband to the birth certificate and giving the kid his last name, which at the time of his birth was just the husband's name, my ex changed hers last month before our court date. They also tried to make my son a junior for the husband (first and middle name) but something changed so his name is another form of her husband's name.

DNA proved I was the father. The judge ordered us to attend two mediation and therapy sessions together (me and my ex). We didn't reach an agreement because she was clear she wanted me out of the picture and wanted her husband to raise my son as his own. The judge did not take kindly to that. In my petition to the courts I said I wanted my son to have my last name, not his stepfather's.

The outcome from court was 50/50 physical and legal custody. My son's last name was changed (as was his first name because my ex's husband was bitter he didn't get his junior in my son). We are to communicate through an app about our son and nothing else. Neither of us pays child support. We both have to make decisions for him. I'm also on the birth certificate now.

My ex hates me for all that I did but the sorest point seems to be the last name. Her mom called me and I only met her twice while I was with my ex. But she called me and told me I was a petty little kid who was playing daddy when her grandson deserved a real man for a father and he had/has one in the husband and I should have left them to raise him together so he could have the stability of one home. She told me to deny ""that wonderful man"" the right to pass his name onto a child he swore to love as his own is awful and that my ex as the mom should share a name with her child. Then I had one of my ex's friends come up to me while I was out getting groceries and she called me petty for fighting for my son's last name. My ex also brought it up during our last exchange. She told me she hoped I was damn proud of myself for fighting over the name when she had her husband's name too and she wanted it to be their family name and I denied their son that (she said their son).

2,1dskwmk,AITA for leaving my brother out of social situations?,"Title, but here‚Äôs some context:
- I am 22f living at home for the summer (I go to uni in the winter months to a city 2h away)

-my brother 20m has been living at home and tried uni but had difficulty with it being online. He has struggled socially since COVID and is likely on the spectrum. 

- I am queer, not closeted when I am at uni during the winter among friends and others, but closeted during the summer months as my parents and community are homophobic and hostile. My parents, while liberal, are very homophobic and I fear they have ‚Äúsuspected something‚Äù about me as I have not expressed interest in dating men (or anyone for that matter) 

- Most of my friends are queer. I have two ‚Äúfriend groups‚Äù: one of friends that originated from my hometown, and one of friends I made at uni. The hometown friends are more empathetic to my situation (they have known me and my brother for years and understand that he is likely on the spectrum), and my uni friends do their best to be understanding. 

-my brother has historically ‚Äúsnitched‚Äù on me for various things and tends to side with my parents/show no opinion at all/be fully neutral on things such as homophobia, behaviours like smoking and drinking, and general behavior that would be deemed immoral (swearing, sex outside of marriage, etc.)

Because of these reasons, I have been VERY apprehensive about introducing my friends- especially uni friends- to my parents and brother. I fear that the presence of my visibly trans and queer friends would mark me as ‚Äúguilty‚Äù in my parents eyes, and I would lose them.
 (Context: when I was in high school some friends and I snuck out to a local Pride parade. We were found out, and the discussion with my parents essentially boiled down to ‚Äúif you are like that, you are not welcome in this house‚Äù. Because of this, I am deeply afraid of being outed to them) 

Recently, I have been making the two hour drive to see my uni friends. I try to make these trips short and uneventful, not colliding with any family events I am going to. My mom has seemingly started to realize that I am working to keep my friends and family separate, and wants me to bring my brother along to these hang outs.
 The thing is, some of the time I would be with friends that would actually try to ‚Äúpass‚Äù as straight and cis- but I still don‚Äôt really want my brother there. I love my brother deeply- but attempts at this previously have resulted in misgendering of my friend and him describing to our mom how my friends dress in clothing that does not adhere to their gender presentation as he saw it. 

Whenever my mom asks if my brother can come along, I quickly change the subject or don‚Äôt give her an answer.  I feel horrible doing that to my brother, and she does not let me forget it. AITA?

This was agreed on the day before we went. When we got to the restaurant it said that today they only accepted cash due to the card reader being broken so the only person who had cash on them agreed to pay and us send them money. Since I only had Zelle, my friend K told me I could just send the money to her and she'd send it to the person paying with cash. The entire day I was apologizing about slowing everyone down because I felt bad but they knew what they agreed to and all that was communicated back to me was ""it's okay, don't worry"". Apparently things were not ok because when I got home l saw this message: ""the way you were acting today was super inconsiderate of everyone around you and i just had to let you know...making us walk to somewhere completely out of the way because you can only eat kosher...so bring food with u like??? and then having my friends pay for your food was just downright disrespectful and ON TOP of all that we had to walk slower to make sure that you weren't left behind which honestly should not be our responsibility if you can't handle standing or walking for long periods of time you shouldn't go to events like this ""

6,1dsgse7,AITA for wanting my son's girlfriend to leave?,"Last September, my then 18 year old son asked if he could move his 17 year old girlfriend in because she came from a harsh and abusive home. I was hesitant and really didn't want to take on caring for another person. My husband and I were looking forward to finally having time to ourselves since we have raised three children. I gave in and felt bad for her. The mother didn't care if she left and so the journey of getting her to finish school and be financially responsible for her care, clothes, food, etc. began.  The problem I have is, I have told her how beautiful and intelligent she is to get her to feel more confident about herself. She hardly engages with any other members of our family except my son. She doesn't talk, doesn't like to leave her room, sleeps all the time, eats whatever and barely cleans up after herself. I've noticed that my son is constantly taking care of her and cleaning up after her. Ive tried having conversations with her about expectations but nothing works. She is now retreating to her room when my husband and I walk in the door. Zero conversation! She will be 18 in a few weeks and she's expected to get a job and start college. That's the rules for staying with us but I'm seeing no indication of her trying to get a job. Any communication from her goes through my son and then he tells me. I feel like I'm a stranger in my own home and I have to tiptoe around her feelings. Not sure what else I can do. 
So AITA for giving her one month to get a job or face moving out and also making my son angry with me?

Also, most of the stories of abuse turned out to be false. Yes, her mother sucks but I was told some pretty horrific things which were proven otherwise.

Throw away account. 5 years ago my ex and I split up. She has a son from a previous relationship, and he was roughly 9 months old when we met. We dated for quite some time, had a daughter, she cheated and we split. We decided custody out of court at the time would be one week with me, one week with her. However, she told me I couldn‚Äôt have my daughter if I didn‚Äôt also take her son and raise him (bio dad isn‚Äôt in the picture). Like a fool I agreed out of fear of her taking my daughter away, as women are automatically custodial parent where I live. So I raise him for the most part, never really bonding as father and son. Fast forward a couple of years, she gets married, her husband adopts her son. She continues to expect me to care for him with my daughter. Recently she tries to take my daughter from me, and I had enough. I called an attorney and got everything ready to fight for set custody that can‚Äôt be taken on a whim. I can tell her son doesn‚Äôt want to be here, I‚Äôve asked her several times to sit him down and ask what it is that he wants, but she tells me I should be fighting for him, that I‚Äôm less of a man for even asking her that. I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve spent so much time and money on a child that isn‚Äôt mine that has zero bond with me. After all this custody stuff dies down I‚Äôm completely done with him. I feel as though I shouldn‚Äôt have done it from the beginning, but especially after her husband adopted him. I feel like that should have been his responsibility from that point on. She‚Äôs constantly worried about messing him up mentally, but refuses to look at the situation and see that it‚Äôs not healthy, and tries to blame me for everything that goes wrong. I just want my daughter so I can put all of my effort into her and raise her to be the best person I possible can.

AITA for not wanting to take care of my exes son anymore?

Throw away account. 5 years ago my ex and I split up. She has a son from a previous relationship, and he was roughly 9 months old when we met. We dated for quite some time, had a daughter, she cheated and we split. We decided custody out of court at the time would be one week with me, one week with her. However, she told me I couldn‚Äôt have my daughter if I didn‚Äôt also take her son and raise him (bio dad isn‚Äôt in the picture). Like a fool I agreed out of fear of her taking my daughter away, as women are automatically custodial parent where I live. So I raise him for the most part, never really bonding as father and son. Fast forward a couple of years, she gets married, her husband adopts her son. She continues to expect me to care for him with my daughter. Recently she tries to take my daughter from me, and I had enough. I called an attorney and got everything ready to fight for set custody that can‚Äôt be taken on a whim. I can tell her son doesn‚Äôt want to be here, I‚Äôve asked her several times to sit him down and ask what it is that he wants, but she tells me I should be fighting for him, that I‚Äôm less of a man for even asking her that. I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve spent so much time and money on a child that isn‚Äôt mine that has zero bond with me. After all this custody stuff dies down I‚Äôm completely done with him. I feel as though I shouldn‚Äôt have done it from the beginning, but especially after her husband adopted him. I feel like that should have been his responsibility from that point on. She‚Äôs constantly worried about messing him up mentally, but refuses to look at the situation and see that it‚Äôs not healthy, and tries to blame me for everything that goes wrong. I just want my daughter so I can put all of my effort into her and raise her to be the best person I possible can.

8,1dsgik8,AITA for not telling my gf everything about my other IG account?,"My gf recently checked-out my other Instagram account and found a bunch of accounts it follows which she considers questionable. 

This IG account is one I use for research, special interests, and commenting on things I don‚Äôt want associated with my personal account. My personal account is private and only has (and follows) around 200 people. 

The account in question follows around 1,600 but has close to 25,000 followers. Indeed, the initial purpose of this IG account was to research engagement and retention and how to properly monetize IG. Over the years, it‚Äôs shifted focus and I use it mostly to follow people and companies engaged in things that interest me, and to post comments, mostly political, that I wouldn‚Äôt want to be associated personally with.  

As it happens, this account follows a bunch of beautiful women/models (maybe 100 out of 1,600)‚Ä¶ initially, because the strategy of engagement and retention called for it.  One is actually fully AI. Another is a woman dating a friend. Some I flippantly add and don‚Äôt remember why. Something, when suggested, piqued my interest. 

I have never communicated with any of them. Not a word. Nor would I. And once I‚Äôve found what I want (if there was something worth finding), I typically forget about these accounts. 

She‚Äôs upset I‚Äôm following some bikini model. My reply is I‚Äôm following an account that generates impressive AI content, and that aspect of it intrigues me. I follow a lot of male-generated AI content too, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. None of the other accounts matter. Tech, AI, political‚Ä¶ irrelevant. But the ones that happen to be beautiful women; problem.

She feels I‚Äôve been shady and hiding things. This account has always been public. Anyone can see everyone it follows. But, she doesn‚Äôt check it too often and only accidentally stumbled upon a mutual friend that both she and this account follow, and that set her off looking at who else is being followed. 

I haven‚Äôt been trying to hide anything intentionally. There‚Äôs nothing to hide. But still, she‚Äôs upset and feels I should‚Äôve mentioned it.  

I‚Äôve never felt the need to mention it because it‚Äôs insignificant and irrelevant. Obviously, if I were communicating with any of them, that‚Äôd be a huge issue. 

I‚Äôve obviously also offered to just unfollow those accounts and/or just shut down the whole account, but apparently that doesn‚Äôt address any part of the issue. The damage is done. 

I‚Äôm not sure how relevant this is, but I‚Äôll mention that she has been cheated on a lot. Like basically, every relationship she‚Äôs ever been in. I, on the other hand, know me and my intentions and have zero intentions of cheating on her.

So‚Ä¶ AITA? If so, what did I do and what should‚Äôve I done differently?

Is this salvageable, or did it blow up the trust? I think it would be insane to throw out 5 years over this, but it‚Äôs not my call. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just a little naive with respect to how others might see things so completely differently than me.

A few days ago, a package arrived for him. He wasn't home, so I left it on the kitchen counter. When he got back, he seemed really surprised and almost panicked when he saw the package. I noticed it was from his mom, which confused me, but I didn't say anything at first.

Later that night, while he was in the shower, I saw the package open on the table. Inside was a large sum of money and a note. I was shocked to see how much money his mom had sent him. The note was from her, saying she hopes he's doing well and that she prays every day for his forgiveness. She mentioned something about hoping he can forgive her for the past.

When he came out of the shower, I gently asked him about the package. He became very quiet and his expression turned cold. He simply said it was none of my business. I told him I just wanted to understand because he always said he didn't have a mom. He calmly repeated that he doesn't have a mom and that she's dead to him.

I was taken aback and didn't know what to say. He remained distant and cold, refusing to share anything more with me.

I felt bad for him but also felt bad for his mom. I decided to meet her myself to understand more about the situation. When I met her, I was surprised by how young and beautiful she looked for being the mother of a 21-year-old. She was in her late 30s and seemed genuinely remorseful and concerned about her son. She told me that she had him when she was very young. Shortly after his birth, her parents kicked her out of the house, and his dad left her to fend for herself with a baby. She struggled a lot trying to provide for him, and despite her best efforts, he grew up unhappy and blamed her for his difficult life. He felt that his life was a burden he never asked for, and eventually, that resentment boiled over.

When he turned 17, he packed his things and left without a word. Later, he told her that he wished he was never born and blamed her for bringing him into a life of misery. It was the most painful thing she had ever heard. Since then, she's been trying to reach out to him, sending gifts and notes, hoping he would see how sorry she was and that she never wanted his life to be this way.

I went back and suggested to my boyfriend that he talk to his mom, explaining how she seemed sincere in wanting to make amends. For the first time, his cold demeanor cracked. He looked sad and seemed on the verge of tears. It was a side of him I hadn't seen before, and it broke my heart.

Later that night, I heard him sobbing on the couch, whispering ""Mom"" repeatedly. He didn't notice me standing there, and I felt a pang of sadness for him.

I'm peeved because she hasn't answered my text despite being on her phone for hours, and while the event isn't until this upcoming weekend, I still have to coordinate with other people about rides. I'm also peeved because this isn't a new thing with her - she usually answers my messages towards the end of the day because out sleep schedules are so different, but I feel like if she's obviously on her phone she should at least be checking to see if I messaged, especially when we text so often.

16,1dsfx23,AITA for Proceeding with Balcony Maintenance Despite Neighbor's Objections?,"I live in a condo with a metal balcony that covers only half of the balcony below. Due to poor construction, significant rust developed, and the paint peeled off last year. Last summer, I scrubbed, washed, and repainted it, unaware that water and paint would flow onto the balcony below. I assumed the balcony extended out to a dirt road alley, but photos from the owner below showed my balcony partly within hers, not extending onto the sidewalk‚Äîa design flaw. My husband and I promptly cleaned it.

Unfortunately, rust has returned, prompting me to seek a long-term solution with durable epoxy paint. I need to remove rust and clean off excess paint before applying it, and I've requested permission to tarp her balcony and glass railing below. Despite multiple discussions and texts, she refused to let me put up the tarp, saying things like ""Your tarp won't do any good just like you"" and was unnecessarily rude. She suggested sanding and vacuuming, which we eventually did. However, I warned her that washing down before painting might still result in some residue or cleaning agents washing down.

She often cleans her own balcony and, having no neighbors below, has no problem with runoff. We have been nothing but helpful, ensuring she got her windows fixed, helping with a car charger, and assisting with many other tasks. She is old, and we have always tried to support her.

During a visit to our unit last week, she made several microaggressive, racist remarks, implying that we should have cleaned her balcony for a long time, treating us as though we were her servants. She also mocked and imitated me. When I asked why she was being uncooperative despite all the help I‚Äôve given her, she seemed unappreciative and dismissed my assistance as if it meant nothing. It has also come to my attention that she made comments about us ‚Äúbrown people‚Äù and how we ""make a mess"" to other residents. To clarify, we are extremely clean people and even wipe our dog's paws with wet wipes every time we take her on a walk before letting her back in the house! Despite her racist comments, I offered to hose down and pressure wash her balcony after cleaning mine. We wiped down the entire balcony with wet rags to catch as much of the old paint peel/rust as possible before washing it down! But she did not respond to my messages, declined my calls, and did not answer the door when I knocked.

Given the design flaw, we cannot be blamed for the situation and have tried to find a solution that has gone unacknowledged. The repairs are essential to maintain our balcony's structural integrity above hers and prevent yearly issues. They're urgent before our summer trip due to weather conditions.

17,1dsfv3f,AITA for not going to a party organised by estranged family,"My mom's family had a big fight about 15 years ago because of an inheritance. The main fight was between my mom and dad on the one hand, and my aunts Lorna and Missy on the other hand. The specific cause of the fight is not relevant to this post, but had something to do with pieces of land that were given to some family members before my grandmother's passing and how to count their value. After this fight, a few attempts for reconciliation were made, to no avail. This was all more than 10 years ago. There was no contact with Lorna or Missy ever since. My other aunts Ally, Maeve and Ginny never took a side and are still in touch with both 'parts' of the family.

Five years ago, my mother passed away after she had cancer for 6 months. Lorna and Missy never contacted her while she was ill, but did visit her in the hospital during her last week (when she was not lucid anymore). They did come to the funeral, but did not speak to me. I found it very sad that they never made up while my mom was still alive. We have not been in touch since. 

Now, one of Lorna's daughters organises a BBQ and invited the whole family, including us. I was unsure whether to go, since I got a baby 5 weeks ago and it might be too busy for the baby. I also don't want to leave my baby alone yet.  However, I wanted to go as I saw it as an attempt for reconciliation. 

After a talk to my dad, I decided not to go. He pointed out that none of the estranged family members have congratulated me for the birth of the baby. Also, they have never apologised or said their regrets for not making up while my mom was still alive. He made it clear that it would hurt him if I would go to this party, because I would prioritise the estranged family over seeing him more frequently after having the baby. I do see him once a week, but he would like that to be more often.

18,1dsfrb2,AITA? Not wanting to work for my parent full time b/c I want time to work on my art,"I'm a Digital Arts major college student about to go into my last year of college. To get some money I wanted to apply for a job for the summer until school starts. Originally I was working for my parent at a nail salon they own. Unfortunately, my parent is very inflexible and does not provide a part-time position. The full-time job is working 5 days of the week and about 10 hours everyday and breaks are when there are no customers to work on. This job also, as it is a nail technician job, requires physical contact with others which I am uncomfortable with. But the pay is good because, well, its a full time job and also pay is under the table.

Because of these conditions I've opted to instead work a part-time position as a retailer. Part-time because I do twitch streams on the weekends and I want time to rest my body and be able to work on my art career. 

This choice has caused my family to daily remind me that:  
1) My Parent is exhausted everyday working at the nail salon they own.  
2) I get paid less at the part-time job  
3) My art is useless  
4) I am being ungrateful to my parent.

I understand that my parent is very kind for hiring me and providing me a job when getting a job is a challenge. There's a reason I had to work at my parents place instead of immediately working a job. I also understand that my parent is old and tired from having to work everyday at the company they own. It could be that I am just complaining about nothing and that working a full time job will always be hard.

But I want to work on my art career and hopefully be able to work a job I am more comfortable in. There is merch I want to make and upload and I'm very willing to take commissions anytime. I just don't want to be working a full-time job but my family has framed it as the worst decision and that I'm going to die if I continue.

19,1dsfoz0,WIBTA for leaving my 4th of July hangout with my friends because they won't let me have shrooms,"I (19M) am in a friend group with four other guys: (Sha, 22M), (Aph, 22M), (Kat, 22M) and (Gan, 23M). Our interactions as a friend group are primarily online playing videogames through discord, but we do meet up to play D&D once a week, and often have hangouts for holidays, long weekends, and similar stuff. At our D&D sessions and at these hangouts, all four of them regularly drink alcohol, and two of them (Aph, 22M) and (Kat, 22M) smoke weed. I am aware that Aph, Kat, and Gan have at least some experience with harder drugs

I have never drank nor done any kind of drugs whatsoever, and they know that. They often offer me their blunt or whatever they're drinking once towards the start of the night, I always politely decline, and they've never pushed after that. I‚Äôm not committed to abstinence from drugs/alcohol or anything - on each occasion on which it has been an option, I have just made the individual decision on that night not to. I've always known I‚Äôm just waiting until the day I‚Äôm interested enough to try.

Recently, Aph invited us to his house for the 4th. In discord, Aph brought up potentially doing shrooms on one of the nights. This intrigued me. I am genuinely interested in how it would feel, and it doesn't seem like the opportunity to try shrooms comes around super often. I voiced this interest, and Aph basically shut me down entirely. Not rudely, but definitively. I said it wasn't really his choice to make, and he said that he didn't want to have to worry about my safety/health as I was tripping while he was also tripping. I brought up that he had introduced the idea as if he, Kat, and Gan would all do it, with Sha being offered the opportunity, although they expected him to refuse, and it was therefore somewhat rude and exclusionary for me to be solely unincluded. When I said ‚Äúso Sha can make sure we‚Äôre fine, then,‚Äù it was mentioned that they don't think Sha would be a good caretaker of someone who's tripping due to the fact that he feeds off of pranking people, but that logic just sounded even more ridiculous to me since it holds the implication that I, the person they are saying is too young and innocent to engage with shrooms, am the expected caretaker for all three of them. Sha said he‚Äôs not worried about any of them the same way he‚Äôs worried about me.

I texted Kat about it today as well to get his opinion, and he essentially had the same reaction. ""If we do shrooms, you are indeed not allowed to do them. Hard no.""

I'm pretty pissed that they think they can just decide for me that I'm not allowed to do it with them, but all I've done so far is lightly give up arguing in the two circumstances outlined above. Here's my plan, and what my post is asking about. WIBTA if I show up for the hangout and make it abundantly clear I still want to try, and if they reject me in person too and take the shrooms themselves to have a good time and enjoy tripping, I just go home and later stand by my opinion that they‚Äôre in the wrong for excluding me?

I moved into the rental in mid 2023 and left a few months ago without giving notice as I was in a bad situation. I did not have a rental contract and was on a month to month basis with paying rent.

Looking back the first red flag was when the landlord made moves on me the second night I was there despite having a fianc√©e by asking for a massage. Eventually this came to a point where they were able to manipulate me emotionally to the point of where I felt obligated to give them money; when I said I was not comfortable, they would say ""You'll recover with your next paycheck."" As I believed I felt something for them, I gave them the money without asking questions (stupid, I know). Eventually it came to a point where I was giving them my entire pay and had given them nearly my entire savings; total around 36K in 5 months while rent was 550 a month.

After the taxes situation and telling my family, they helped me get out the night they found out that I was looking for another place as I was afraid I might fall back on my resolve if I conversed with them.

When they called, I told them that it was not working out and they threatened to sue for emotional damages. But when I went to pack my things and leave, they said they would not do so and had nothing against me.

24,1dt7jgf,AITA for telling my husband he needs to quit his dream job?,"So I (32F) and my husband (29M) live in an area with an extremely high cost of living. I work a job that pays decently well, which is kind of necessary to live where we do. My husband worked a job for years that paid less than mine did, but was okay overall, though he absolutely hated working there.

Around October of last year, my husband managed to get a job in his dream career field. He had been working at it for years, and was really excited about finally getting there. However, it's come with 

The big issue is, the pay in his field is abysmal. He works as a freelancer (which is standard in his industry) so his job has zero benefits, and it's a pretty significant pay cut from his old job.

We don't have combined finances, and after he took the new job, we had to rearrange how we pay for things to account for his lower income. Previously, he had covered a slightly larger percentage of the expenses due to me having student loans to pay off while he didn't. As it is now, I have to be the breadwinner since his income was basically halved, paying for a larger portion of the expenses.

I sat him down recently and told him I felt he needed to quit his job and find a better-paying field because it just wasn't feasible. He got upset, since like I said, this is something he's dreamed of for years and worked really hard to get, which I understand. But I just feel this  isn't fair to me. We've had to cut back on a lot of things and there's not really any sign of a pay increase at this point. I feel like I'm carrying him.

He offered to get a part-time job on the side, but I know anything he could get that would be feasible for him while keeping his current job wouldn't provide much. He suggested we move somewhere less expensive, to which I said absolutely not, since we'd have to go quite  a ways to find something in that range and it'd mean ridiculously long commutes to my work and being further away from my family. He offered to have his parents help, which I don't want because it's not a long-term solution.

He's extremely upset, and I understand it, because I know he worked hard to get here. If he quit now, it'd basically kill his career and it would be extremely hard for him to get another shot at this job. It's not like we're struggling, which is true, we can pay rent and put food on the table, but I hate feeling like this. I work long days at a rather difficult job, while he works from home doing something he did before as a hobby and only makes half as much money now. My point is that it's not like he has to stop doing what he does altogether, since as I mentioned, he did it as a hobby beforehand, but he's upset because he said this is the only thing he's ever wanted to do career-wise and giving it up now would mean he likely never would be able to make it work.

25,1dt7idd,AITA for asking my husband to hold his pee during flight with 2 kids,"My husband and I flew a 3.5hr flight with our 3mo old and 2.5yo recently. We were unable to buy seats together so I was in the middle aisle with baby and he was across the aisle of me with the aisle seat and the toddler in the middle. 

About an hour into the flight my husband gets up to pee while I‚Äôm nursing baby and as soon as he leaves the toddler crawls over to me. I try to get the toddler to sit on my lap but he causes baby to stop eating so baby is crying on me while I‚Äôm trying to hold the toddler and not disrupt the two people I‚Äôm sitting next to. Plus my husband got stuck behind the beverage cart so he could grab the toddler for 20 minutes. 

Later, my husband gets up to pee again while I‚Äôm feeding baby and same thing happens of trying to feed baby with a toddler on my lap. Ending up with a crying baby and a toddler in one middle seat.


Back story, my husband pees a lot. I‚Äôve worked with a pelvic floor therapist and told her how frequently he pees and she agrees it‚Äôs too much and he should work with PT to avoid issues down the road. He says he doesn‚Äôt need help and blames it on drinking lots of water. He does work a full time job in an office and does go hours without peeing when he has back to back calls so he‚Äôs capable of holding it. He‚Äôs never peed himself or had an accident. He did go to the urologist this year who ruled out any prostate, or cancer. 

After the flight, I told my husband how hard it was to balance both boys and asked if he can just hold his pee. So many times I have to pee when I‚Äôm watching the boys but hold it until timing is better. He said he can‚Äôt.

Next, I asked if he could ask me before he pees and go when baby isn‚Äôt nursing and I have two hands. He said no and he should be able to pee when he has to go. 

We have a full summer of flying ahead of us including a few international trips and I‚Äôm worried. 

*edit he gets annual physicals and is extremely healthy. No diabetes and all labs are WNL. He does ultra marathons and has never peed on himself during a long run.

He likes to watch stuff and play games on his computer in there and when he‚Äôs home alone he‚Äôs typically in there. I enjoy being in the living room more, we have a sectional couch that‚Äôs more comfortable than my desk chair and I enjoy cuddling up on it when I eat and watch tv/ play video games. Most nights when I get home from work I spend the rest of the evening in the living room. I do spend time in the spare room with my husband sometimes too but it‚Äôs not very comfortable and currently my desk is taken up with his 3D printer so I can‚Äôt eat or even fit my laptop on it. Half of the time my husband will join me in the living room and we watch tv together. We enjoy eachother company. 

The issue at hand is that sometimes I will be out in the living room playing games or watching tv, and my husband will come out and lay on other end of the sectional which 100% of the time results in him falling asleep- which 100% of the time results in him snoring at a ridiculous volume (obnoxiously loud). This happens EVERY time he lays down on the couch in the evenings. He doesn‚Äôt snore like this when we sleep in the bed, just the couch.

As the years have gone on it‚Äôs made me more and more upset, because it always interrupts whatever I‚Äôm doing and I have to leave the room when I was there first. I‚Äôve recorded him to show him how loud he is, I‚Äôve cried to him about how inconsiderate I‚Äôve felt it is, and there have been moments that I‚Äôve screamed at him because he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why I‚Äôm upset. It‚Äôs actually driving me crazy.

I shake him when he snores and ask him to sit up so he will stop but he‚Äôll always sleepily say ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and go right back to sleep and snore even more, then I wake him again to ask him to stop and the cycle continues until I‚Äôve had enough and have to leave the room and find something else to do. 

As the years have gone on it‚Äôs made me more and more upset, because it always interrupts whatever I‚Äôm doing and I have to leave the room when I was there first. I‚Äôve recorded him to show him how loud he is, I‚Äôve cried to him about how inconsiderate I‚Äôve felt it is, and there have been moments that I‚Äôve screamed at him because he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why I‚Äôm upset. It‚Äôs actually driving me crazy. 

I‚Äôve talked to him about it countless times over the years and he just doesn‚Äôt get it. He continues to come out and lay down on the couch when I‚Äôm out there and I constantly ask him to not fall asleep because he‚Äôll snore and I‚Äôll have to leave, and he‚Äôll jokingly say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even snore‚Äù like it‚Äôs funny. I am actually losing my mind. He‚Äôs laying next to me right now and I snapped and said if he falls asleep and starts snoring again then it‚Äôs going to ruin my entire night and I can‚Äôt take it anymore and he acted like I was overreacting.",0.0,1.0124183893203735,1,0

34,1dt6bmj,WIBTA for not changing my wedding date so future niece can attend?,"Fiance (28F) & I (34M) are choosing wedding dates \~12 months out. Wedding event will be casual group meals at a small Caribbean island for 30-35 people. We wanted to work around major conflicts for all attendees as possible.

We excluded dates (1) in high season (would be >30% more expensive, out of budget for >20% of attendees); (2) bad for 5 attendees working on private school academic calendars; (3) overlapping w/ hurricane season. A window of three consecutive weekends remained.

3 conflicts emerged (1 each week):

* Best man has weeklong event for work where he is the face of a globally renown institution. Was recently promoted to top-2 position of his org. at staggeringly young age. Large part of job is relationship building with alumni and ppl at peer institutions. The income from teaching at this event is meaningful to him.
* Fianc√©‚Äôs best friend has volunteered as counselor at week-long camp for children with a congenital illness for 15 years. Camp is same week every year; he serves as a counselor at 1-2 other similar summer camps each summer. He is deeply passionate about this work.
* Future SIL (32F)‚Äôs daughter (my niece, 13F) would need to skip last days of 8th grade to attend. Fianc√©‚Äôs parents‚Äô stance (and maybe SIL‚Äôs): if niece is unable to attend our wedding, my SIL (maid of honor) cannot attend b/c that family (2 parents, 2 toddlers, 13yo) shouldn‚Äôt have to split up.

There have been many trips to Disney World where one or multiple children, including 13yo, were left behind with fam.



Potential compromises:

1. Schedule during hurricane season (backup options for wedding w/ a storm = 0).
2. Schedule during high season (will break 6-10 people‚Äôs budgets, cost >$10K more for us)
3. Schedule for date that excludes best man OR forces him to skip his work engagement
4. Schedule for date that excludes fianc√©‚Äôs best friend OR forces him to skip counselor role
5. Postpone by a year (disappointment, delay timeline for having children, make fianc√© feel less young and bridal at wedding)

7. SIL & fam attend the wedding w/o 8th grade daughter, who could stay w/ biological mother, miss our wedding.

35,1dt6atd,AITA for changing the passwords on my accounts?,"My ex  and I recently broke up.  We were together for over two years but for the majority of it it was a bad cycle of, him cheating on me, me finding out, him blaming me (most of the time) then us getting back together.  It was very toxic towards the end.  

During that time we started playing on a private server of an mmo that he enjoyed. You could create multiple characters to play at once.  I didn‚Äôt have as much free time to play as him so he offered to level up my characters for me when I couldn‚Äôt play.

Eventually he kind of took over my accounts.  He set up a multibox program and included my characters in the setup.  I was frustrated but kind of let it go.  I eventually created a couple new characters but lost interest since they weren‚Äôt the ones I wanted to play.  He would occasionally bring up how I never play anymore and seemed disappointed  but then I would mention that it‚Äôs not because I didn‚Äôt want to play but because he took over my accounts.  

Anyways,  he ended up cheating again and I found out. I changed the passwords to my accounts.   I felt bad and ended up giving him the passwords.

Stupid me attempted to reconcile where I set hard boundaries, I asked him if he really wanted to be with me, blah blah.   He said he did and it seemed fine for a month.  

He cheated or was at least on dating apps again and I found out.  I snapped, lost my shit,  I called him out again, told him to fuck off and changed the passwords to my accounts again.

We were no contact for a bit until I went to his house to drop off his stuff.  He wasn‚Äôt home so I impulsively let my self in (we had keys to each other‚Äôs places ) to grab the rest of my stuff.  He got home when I was there and we had an argument. He was justifiably upset as he should be.  I apologized (even though it doesn‚Äôt make it right what I did) and we kind of cooled down.

He brought up the accounts and asked me if I was going to give them back to him. I said maybe and asked for an honest apology from him for the way he treated me and all the shit he did behind my back.  He never did apologize. 

We ended up talking and just kind of shooting the shit. I ended up staying the night but leaving the next morning. 

After a few days of casually chatting, he is suddenly pissed again that I never gave him the passwords. I told him all I wanted was an apology and he could have them back. 

 He threatened to block me again (which is fine, It‚Äôs his choice) because he‚Äôs pissed about it still.  He told me that he owed stuff to people he played with and that I‚Äôm taking from them by not giving him my accounts back. That they have nothing to do with him and I. 

I feel justified in what I did (albeit it was done for a childish reason mostly at that point cause i wanted him to suffer for what he did, even if it was my choice to keep going back to a toxic relationship) and also the accounts do belong to me. Am I in the wrong for asking for an apology or even changing the passwords in the first place?

We were together for over two years but for the majority of it it was a bad cycle of, him cheating on me, me finding out, him blaming me (most of the time) then us getting back together.  It was very toxic towards the end.  

During that time we started playing on a private server of an mmo that he enjoyed. You could create multiple characters to play at once.  I didn‚Äôt have as much free time to play as him so he offered to level up my characters for me when I couldn‚Äôt play.

Eventually he kind of took over my accounts.  He set up a multibox program and included my characters in the setup.  I was frustrated but kind of let it go.  I eventually created a couple new characters but lost interest since they weren‚Äôt the ones I wanted to play.  He would occasionally bring up how I never play anymore and seemed disappointed  but then I would mention that it‚Äôs not because I didn‚Äôt want to play but because he took over my accounts.  

Anyways,  he ended up cheating again and I found out. I changed the passwords to my accounts.   I felt bad and ended up giving him the passwords.

Stupid me attempted to reconcile where I set hard boundaries, I asked him if he really wanted to be with me, blah blah.   He said he did and it seemed fine for a month.  

He cheated or was at least on dating apps again and I found out.  I snapped, lost my shit,  I called him out again, told him to fuck off and changed the passwords to my accounts again.

We were no contact for a bit until I went to his house to drop off his stuff.  He wasn‚Äôt home so I impulsively let my self in (we had keys to each other‚Äôs places ) to grab the rest of my stuff.  He got home when I was there and we had an argument. He was justifiably upset as he should be.  I apologized (even though it doesn‚Äôt make it right what I did) and we kind of cooled down.

He brought up the accounts and asked me if I was going to give them back to him. I said maybe and asked for an honest apology from him for the way he treated me and all the shit he did behind my back.  He never did apologize. 

We ended up talking and just kind of shooting the shit. I ended up staying the night but leaving the next morning. 

After a few days of casually chatting, he is suddenly pissed again that I never gave him the passwords. I told him all I wanted was an apology and he could have them back. 

 He threatened to block me again (which is fine, It‚Äôs his choice) because he‚Äôs pissed about it still.  He told me that he owed stuff to people he played with and that I‚Äôm taking from them by not giving him my accounts back. That they have nothing to do with him and I. 

I feel justified in what I did (albeit it was done for a childish reason mostly at that point cause i wanted him to suffer for what he did, even if it was my choice to keep going back to a toxic relationship) and also the accounts do belong to me. Am I in the wrong for asking for an apology or even changing the passwords in the first place?

Recently, (about a month or two ago), he has started making snide remark about my weight. Calling me names like 'fattie', 'fatso', 'chunky', even calling me CasOh sometimes.

I am not insecure about my weight, I never really has, which is why I find it strange he would even bring it up. He doesn't call me these names often, just whenever there is an opportunity in a conversation. I usually just let it roll off my shoulders or coming up with a rebuttal.

Late a couple nights ago I was thinking about the situation and I caught myself wondering if I should be worried about my weight. I realized that I needed to something about the situation because I won't take a blow to my confidence like this by my own brother.

I thought about approaching him and just asking him to stop but that hasn't worked in the past when he crossed the line, so I just decided to give him a petty taste of his own medicine. 

While he was watching over my shoulder a reel about CaseOh showed up. I could feel that he was going to say something about me, so I said something first. I said something along the lines of ""omg, I didn't know you had were on insta! Wait no, he's not as fat as you""

Unlike me, my brother is very sensitive about his weight, and I know that. He ended up locking himself in his room and was visibly upset still when he came out for dinner. When my mom asked what happened I told her that he got mad about me saying he was bigger than CaseOh. She insisted that I apologize, which I did half heartedly. When I explained the situation my mom said that it wasn't the same thing because I knew how he was about weight.

37,1dt6231,AITA for flaking on a pre-planned trip with my friend to save money,"Edit to add info: i told D I wanted to cancel one week in advance. After she offered to pay for food, I officially declined a few days later. The only shared expense was hotel. I was able to get refunds on other prepaid costs, like attraction tickets and public transport. i originally budgeted a few hundred dollars for this trip but that was blown through by my unexpected expenses this month.

 I have known my close friend, D, for almost 10 years. Months ago, we planned a group trip with a handful of mutual friends to go to a big city for the weekend.

D and I recently moved in together as roommates. Things were going great. Then, my car and laptop both randomly broke. Between fixing these things, I spent over $1000 i didn‚Äôt expect to spend this month. I make a low enough income that this is a big deal.

My financial situation is not great right now. I will be changing jobs next month to one that is half my current income. Moving expenses took a chunk out of my savings. And, I am having a cancer scare right now and the testing is eating through my disposable income, even with insurance.

I explained this to D and let them know that I would feel more comfortable saving money by staying home. I would pay for my share of the hotel, but I knew 3 days of eating out, going to bars, and doing attractions in a big city would destroy my budget.

D said this would hurt their feelings and they were really looking forward to going with me. She offered to pay for my food the entire trip, but I still declined because A) the expenses of transportation, drinks, etc. would still strain me, B) I feel uncomfortable with her spending that much money on me, and C) it would be embarrassing for our friends to see her pay for me.

She said she couldn‚Äôt believe I chose money over her and asked me not to talk to her about things not related to the apartment. She leaves the room when I come home and leaves any text messages I send her on read. After about 2 weeks of this, I finally sent her a long text message saying that I was sorry again and asked if we could go out for dinner to talk and try to repair things. She said she needs more time.

I feel hurt and don‚Äôt know where to go from here. My personal circle is split 50/50 on whether or not I made a mistake. Some of my friends say they would be pissed too and pointed out that you can always earn more money, but friendships are irreplaceable. Other friends sympathize and understand that going on vacation for 3 days is not worth the financial hole it would leave me in.

So, I'm in this Discord GC (have been since 2021) and I'm from a Gaelic speaking part of the British Isles, so I've learnt it in school (from ages 7-now) and would say that I'm pretty fluent.

The Gaelic names are very pretty, imo and they're something I'd consider naming any future kids. (Not that i'm even set on having them yet but anyways)

So I sent a list of Gaelic names (from my language specifically) to this groupchat, because Tee (19F and German) and I were comparing names from our respective homes/languages. when this new-ish addition to the GC, (Q, 19NB, American) looks at the list of names I put and goes, ""Some of these over on this side of the pond would be called tragedeighs"".

They haven't responded, and Tee says I haven't done anything wrong but some of the other Americans in the GC says that ""how were they supposed to know that these names weren't english?""

She RUINED our holiday, was expecting us to do everything she wanted, argued with myself and my 15 year old daughter on day 4 and walked off for over 3 hours with the only key we had to our family room and then left a horrible note on my daughters bed.

All my mother has said to me about her break up is that her partner was annoying her and that she misses the car more than him!

44,1dt5rt7,AITA the asshole for giving my wife donuts.,"A little about us: My wife and I have both struggled with our weight. We‚Äôre not severely obese, but enough that it's uncomfortable. We've tried to be active and go to the gym regularly, but after sickness and having kids, we simply don't have the time and energy. So, we've both tried to lose weight by eating better.

While my wife has a plan from a nutritionist that has helped her lose some kilos, I refuse to let my life revolve around weighing food and counting calories. Instead, I managed to get Ozempic prescribed to me, which has killed my appetite. However, my wife keeps making me food and often puts snacks right in front of me, telling me to eat throughout the day.

The last time I didn‚Äôt eat for a day, she got hysterical. I told her I just wasn't hungry and ended up eating some sausage rolls from Greggs. I also ask her not to make me dinner, but she tells me it‚Äôs her obligation as a wife (while she eats her food).

I used to always eat whatever was in front of me as I have bad willpower when it comes to food, but now I struggle to eat it. I haven't told my wife I'm on Ozempic because she thinks it's not worth it to use drugs and thinks its cheating.

Anyway, yesterday I bought some doughnuts and brought them to her in her office room (we both work from home) and put them in front of her. She got mad, and I told her I wanted her to have happy dopamine and that she needed to eat.

Throughout my pregnancy my sister has been telling me how I should be careful with boyfriend, to look out for the cheating signs.

We were talking about my niece who‚Äôs about to start college then she changes the subject to , repeating the same thing , be careful , don‚Äôt get too attached to him, 
Other stuff.

I lost my patience with her, I told very loudly to shut up since my boyfriend is nothing like her cheating ex-husband , and stop comparing my boyfriend to him,
She keeps stressing me out with the things she tells me about my boyfriend which I don‚Äôt need since I‚Äôm pregnant.

My sister got up from the couch and left ,
around thirty minutes later I get call from my mom yelling at me telling me I‚Äôm being rude to my sister since she‚Äôs trying to protect me against ‚Äò‚Äôheartbreak‚Äô‚Äô

She was 22 and never worked before, I‚Äôm used to go through resumes and interview candidates, so it should be a piece of cake for me
But tbh that is not something I enjoyed at all, I don‚Äôt like feeling like she‚Äôs relying on me and I wanted her to be more curious to do it by herself. I know I‚Äôm projecting because that‚Äôs what I did when I was 20-ish 
Anyway, she got a fairly nice job which is great. 

Now she want to move on to something else, fine by me !
I‚Äôm behind her 100% financially but when it comes to job hunting, she wanted to me to write down her application letters, update her resume and go through everything for her portfolio. I didn‚Äôt wanted it to get tense so I helped her until a point : she has to choose job offers and apply by herself. I‚Äôd like her to be more independant but she keeps telling me that if I don‚Äôt help her, she‚Äôs not going to find a job

Now she wants me to be at her side watching her going through job offers and be available whenever she see fits, which already gets me frustrated

I had to get away from the room earlier when she started modifying the application letter to fit a job offer : that‚Äôs another thing , computer is not her finest skill, not because it‚Äôs difficult for her but because (I think) she‚Äôs not curious enough to learn quicker methods so she takes 4x longer to do a simple thing.

The key factor is that theyre both on the lease, whereas i am not (as the house is not HMO regulated) 

After we got this place, i was visiting them (they live together) to celebrate and brought up about how we should divide the rooms, they dodged this and said we could decide once we have that keys and go see it. a week later i get a text where they were demanding the 2 biggest rooms + there reasons behind it. I disagreed with a majority of the reasons. The part where i may be the asshole is that they did all of the work to find and secure this place. However, there was not much i could have done as i couldnt enquire about any houses, view them or fill in any of the forms as i wasnt going on the lease. despite prior to looking, i said it would make more sense to have me on the lease as they‚Äôre both girls and i‚Äôm a guy, so it‚Äôs far easier to get away with it. Hard to explain a guys stuff being in the house if no guy is supposedly living there, whereas you could play off the extra girls stuff as being for extra storage if we put down a boy/girl on the lease. They didn‚Äôt want this, but didn‚Äôt really fully explain why 

After i got the text, i asked to meet up to discuss it. I travelled to theirs again, and it was a waste of time. We all had points brought up and discussed everything, but couldnt come to an agreement.  They were not willing to find a fair way to divide the rooms up. I suggested a coin flip, they didn‚Äôt want to do this. There was absolutely no budging on their end in trying to negotiate this fairly. I tried to give some leeway, saying that one of them could have the most sought after room even though it would be my personal choice. Agreed to let them have a cat when i didnt want one + dont really like them. then a coin flip for the remaining rooms, they still didnt agree to this. So no resolution

After evaluating how this unfolded, and how they ganged up against me, im getting bad vibes about living with them.

also unsure about this theory, but i have a gut feeling that it‚Äôs been orchestrated so that no matter where we moved into, i would be forced into the smallest room. i only think this based of the discussion we had and how they worded certain things to me. also by the fact that they constantly kept me out of the loop when it came to house hunting despite me constantly asking to be filled in. and never availed of my help despite me offering many times and that for some odd reason they specifically wanted to be on the lease",Not the A-hole,2024-07-01,"AITA if i don‚Äôt move into a house with my friends and it meaning they would have to cover my rent.

Last month Kat graduated high school and invited our side of the family to watch her graduate. The rest of my family and I didn‚Äôt know she was graduating until 4 days before the event, this is a pattern with my older brother as he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to invite his entire immediate family to his wedding until like 5 days before.

She doesn‚Äôt let Kat have any friends and completely isolates this girl from her extended family.¬†

61,1dt4kd3,"AITA for ""stealing"" from my dead neighbor?","Around a year ago, our next-door neighbor (who I'll just call Ms. Neighbor) passed away. She was probably late 80s or so- nothing unexpected. She also lived alone, so after her passing the house remained empty. Her adult son stayed in the home for a while, and, alongside his sister, maintained the property. It is currently empty and the grass hasn't been mowed in months. It looks somewhat abandoned at the moment.

Our neighborhood has a lot of old-growth trees, and our region is also prone to summer storms with strong winds. This results in lots of branches strewn around lawns after every storm (even entire trees collapsing onto the street like the other day lol)

Recently, I was working on a cosplay with the deadline in less than a week. For the costume, I needed a long branch to use as a prop. It had stormed the night before, so I walked over to the empty yard and grabbed one of the fallen branches. 

The tree it had fallen from was probably less than 10 feet away from our property line, and the branches reached into our property. My mom had even paid for it to be professionally trimmed before (with Ms. Neighbor's consent) 

The problem came when I brought the stick inside and began to work on my prop. When I showed it to my mom, she asked me where I got it from. I told her I got it from Ms. Neighbor's lawn.

 She got angry at me, claiming that I had ""trespassed"" and I shouldn't take things from other's property without permission. The way I saw it, I was doing them a favor by cleaning the yard after a storm. She told me I was still taking things off someone else's yard for my own benefit.

65,1dt3num,AITA for not inviting my sister in law to my bday dinner.,"Throwaway account because my main is... you get the message.

This is eating me alive and I can't stop stressing about it.

Some backstory;
My sister in law (35). Is not my biggest fan. We all live in the same village and share the same friend group.

Through the years she has made a habit of excluding me at party's, dinner dates, backyard fun and even gone as far to tell the group she doesn't like it when me and my husband are also invited at events from people in our circle.
One exceptionally hard on me one was when we asked her and her husband what the plans are with new years eve. And she said hanging at home doing nothing.
While we knew they where giving a party and everyone was invited except us.

This is going on for 10+ years now.

It's my bday in a couple of weeks... and I always go to this steakhouse on the day with my husband. This year a couple of friends said we want to join in. And to my great happiness we're going with a group of 10+

The loner weirdo in me couldn't believe ""I has friends"".

Now here comes in why I feel like the AH... I told my husband I want to invite the SIL and BIL.. he says don't. They never want you there and why should you give up your day and invite them. I checked with a couple of girlfriends and they said the same.

So I didnt invite them.

Now she found out we have this dinner planned and not so subtile mentioned it to me. She found out because she is planning a dinner party at the same date.. and no one is available because they are going with me.

I feel horrible. She's angry and sad.

But I just can't stop feeling like I'm horrible and did to her what makes me feel and have made me feel so excluded and sad.

I wish I just invited them and sucked it up and wasn't an asshole and excluded her.

67,1dt3kvi,AITA for refusing to allow my kids to go to my parents house due to sibling's weed smoking,"We live in an area where cannabis use is still illegal and possession / dealing is punishable with a prison sentence. 

I 35F have two children aged 9 & 6. Generally I have a great relationship with my parents who are relatively young as grandparents go

My sibling, M, mid twenties still lives with my parents and has had some employment since leaving school but is generally mostly unemployed. (This is relevant).

Today I collected my children from my parents house as they had attended a concert which my children were playing in at school. We'd planned to stay a little longer once I spoke to my husband to allow my children to spend time with both their grandparents as one was at work. 

I popped upstairs to use the restroom and once again could smell that someone in the house had been smoking cannabis. This has happened on many occasions. I've raised concerns to my family about this in the past but my sibling has denied it and nothing has been done about it. It is well known within our family that my sibling is a heavy cannabis user. 

I have no issue with him choosing to take drugs, however I do have an issue with him obviously smoking whilst my children are in the same house. 

I left this evening immediately after smelling this.  and text one of my parents later to say that I could smell it in the house, and I was no longer willing to have my children around it any longer. They are becoming aware of it as one said that their uncles room smelled ""funny"" and it was like a smell we'd had when walking and someone walked by smoking. I asked my Mom to visit us in our home if she wanted to from now on, and to instead come to ours if she was dropping the kids off. 

Just to clarify, we do not rely on my parents for childcare at all. My Mom collects one afternoon from school which is her choice, otherwise they'd go to after school care. Sleepovers happen occasionally but they are very much on their terms.
 
My Mom has text me back again tonight saying that my Dad has searched by brothers room (again, mid twenties) and they've found nothing. Apparently he is ""devastated"" and they are adamant that the smell was from some rotten food he had in his room. From the text which was sent it sounded like she would be falling out with me if I didn't go back on what I'd originally said. 

There's a very long history of my sibling being supported no matter what his behaviour, and I strongly believe that he has also started to deal drugs. He is unemployed but currently renting an expensive car and looking at purchasing another. He has no savings that I know of, so even if it's not dealing he's again using my parents for money when he's had a job for less than a year since leaving school 10 years ago.

Before I left I decide I wanted to buy cookies to go. I ordered and waited for them to get them. One of the workers was new and was being helped by someone. The person who trained her got the cookies. Right in front me, she picked up the cookies with her bare hands and put them in a container. I was grossed out but walked away because I didn't know if I was overreacting. I consulted my bf and he said that's gross and I'm not being a Karen. He told me to go back and ask for new ones and offered to go with me since I felt bad and didn't want them to think I was being a jerk. 

When I asked for new cookies and gave the reason, another worker went over and told the original girl that helped and she walked past me while loudly saying she washed her hands. Then all the workers started whispering about it. I got new cookies from another worker who used tongs. When I thanked her I told her that I wasn't trying to call out the other girl but as a fellow food service worker I didn't want something that was grabbed by bare hands. She agreed with me but was probably just being polite.

I would have never touched someone's food without gloves or tongs. That's proper sanitation and most places have it outlined in their contracts.

Was I overreacting?

The person who trained her got the cookies. Right in front me, she picked up the cookies with her bare hands and put them in a container. I was grossed out but walked away because I didn't know if I was overreacting. I consulted my bf and he said that's gross and I'm not being a Karen. He told me to go back and ask for new ones and offered to go with me since I felt bad and didn't want them to think I was being a jerk. 

When I asked for new cookies and gave the reason, another worker went over and told the original girl that helped and she walked past me while loudly saying she washed her hands. Then all the workers started whispering about it. I got new cookies from another worker who used tongs. When I thanked her I told her that I wasn't trying to call out the other girl but as a fellow food service worker I didn't want something that was grabbed by bare hands. She agreed with me but was probably just being polite.

I would have never touched someone's food without gloves or tongs. That's proper sanitation and most places have it outlined in their contracts.

Was I overreacting?

Edit: I'm not sure if she actually washed her hands, but she was touching a bunch of stuff before she even grabbed the cookies. I'm generally non-confrontational and I have trouble speaking up for myself. I also didn't want to be an jerk by saying something if I was in the wrong. Also, the other workers were changing out their gloves and the person that helped me the second time used tongs.",0.0,0.07540074735879898,0,1
69,1dt3hqf,AITA For not babysitting for my BF's brother,"My BF (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 2 years and just moved into an apartment together last month.  Neither of us have trucks or cars suitable for easy moves, so my BF asked his brother, Jack (39M) to help since he has a big SUV.  Both my BF and I had stuff in storage units that we had to move as well.  The move took us an entire weekend.  Jack helped for about 6 hours both days.  We gave him some money for gas and fed him both days.

Both my BF and I are child-free.  We both have siblings that have kids and we've made it clear to them that we aren't available to be free babysitters.  It's not something that either of us have any interest in doing.  Unbeknownst to me, my BF told Jack that in return for helping us move, we would watch Jack's 5-year-old son for a night so Jack and his wife could go on a date.  My BF did not talk to me about this before offering it to Jack.  

Last week, my BF told me that Jack had taken him up on his babysitting offer for Saturday night.  He told me on Tuesday.  I told him this was the first I am hearing about this and I never agreed to that.  He said that Jack did us a huge favor with the move and the least we can do is give them a single night of babysitting.  I told him that since he made the offer, not me, that I won't be helping at all with the kid.  We got into an argument about it because he wanted to babysit at our place and I told him he needs to go to Jack's house to watch the kid instead.  

He eventually agreed to babysit at Jack's house, but when he told Jack about it, he wasn't happy.  He said that he and his wife were hoping for an empty house that night and tried to convince my BF to babysit at our place but I refused.  I have a lot of things at our place that aren't acceptable for a 5-year-old.  My BF eventually worked it out with Jack to babysit at their place, but my BF said Jack is not happy about it and is blaming me. 

My BF got home on Sunday morning and said the babysitting was easy and fun.  A little later, Jack's wife sent pictures of my BF and their son to the family group chat and thanked him for babysitting.  She also said ""Too bad he wasn't able to see BF's new apartment.  Maybe next time!""  Which felt like a passive aggressive dig at me.   

My BF said I am reading too much into it and I shouldn't take it personally. But he did tell me that Jack questioned him a lot as to why he couldn't babysit at our new place.  My BF said he made excuses about the place not being fully unpacked and ready for that sort of thing.  But he knows his brother and he thinks Jack knows it's because of me and he's worried Jack will be less inclined to help us again if we need it.  

But it's not like our stance on babysitting is new to anyone.  We're pretty upfront about not being anyone's top babysitting choice.  In an emergency, sure.  But outside of an emergency, it's not something I want to be involved with.

He denied all those things and said that I was being a crazy possessive girlfriend and that what he did was completely normal. 

I talked some friends and they sided with him saying that he meeting his best friend after a long time and that he must have wanted to
make the most out of it. 

This got me wondering if I was in the wrong and if I should‚Äôve made more of an effort.

79,1dt1l96,AITA for refusing my dad rent money?,"My entire life, my dad struggled with money, causing us to almost be kicked out every month. He worked delivery jobs with inconsistent pay and would take days off if he didn't feel like working.

Then with help from my grandparents, we bought a house, and he started day trading, claiming it was just as hard as delivery driving but he figured out from studying how to make money from the market. Unfortunately, we lost the house and learned he maxed out all the credit cards trying to pay the mortgage. We moved into a small apartment.

At the apartment, he was back to delivery driving, but we were ALWAYS late on rent. After a few eviction notices, he'd ask my mother to call my grandparents to cover the difference, promising to pay them back, which he did. However, this created a cycle where he spent half the month paying back borrowed money, making us late on rent again.

My mother eventually saved enough from her job to secretly cover the rent, pretending she borrowed it from my grandparents. I didn't understand why she pretended until I went to college.

When I entered college, I got a scholarship and thought we could break the cycle. I gave my scholarship to my dad to pay back the grandparents and cover rent for the month, hoping he could make the next month‚Äôs rent. Instead, he took two weeks off, claiming work was slow.  
  
You guessed it... he borrowed money again. When studying full-time, I worked weekends to help with rent, which made me resentful but taught me the value of money management. I also had to skip class and learn through lecture notes because  I'd struggle paying for the train. Made me suuper resentful.

After graduating, I got a great job, moved out, and bought a condo. My mom got a huge promotion shortly after and started making good money. My dad then quit his job...to day trade. I warned him it was like gambling and suggested he get a minimum wage job to cover his share of expenses, but he didn‚Äôt listen.

A few months after I moved out, he called with an excuse and asked for money to cover rent. I gave it to him (he paid me back). But a few months later, he asked again with a different excuse. I refused and told him to talk to my mom, leading to a huge fight between them.

Three months later, he asked again, wanting me to front the rent to avoid fighting with my mom. I completely refused, saying they needed to talk it out. He sounded stressed but eventually said okay and hung up. I do have the money, but I don't want to get caught in this cycle again. I feel bad for my mom, who will have to cover for him, and I also feel guilty for saying no and potentially causing a fight.

I am no longer receiving child support for my oldest. This has significantly reduced my income. I have been seeing my partner for almost three years. We have lived separate because of my children being so young. Recently we have talked about getting married and moving in together. But have not set any official dates. Today I found out that I lost my state insurance and nutrition assistance due to a 2% raise I received. Adding an insurance for my children and budgeting in groceries would put me almost a thousand dollars in additional expenses. I will no longer be able to afford  and meet basic needs of my kids.

I would also like to stress that I was more than happy to make the trip after he mentioned he wanted me there; however, the part he took issue with was that I should have known better and he shouldn‚Äôt have to ask me to be there for his birthday.

I didn‚Äôt really understand why he would expect this. Here are the reasons why I assumed I wouldn‚Äôt be there:

1. I would have been 180 miles away in my hometown
2. He has class Monday 1-3, Tuesday 1-3, and Wednesday 9-12. He also has work Tuesday 7-11am. It didn‚Äôt really make sense to me to make a whole trip when he would be busy for a majority of the time we could have together
3. I had assumed that I would travel to him on a later weekend when we both had more free time to celebrate him
4. Tbh I don‚Äôt like the long drive, and I don‚Äôt naturally think to do things I don‚Äôt like doing. Of course I would be happy to do it when asked, but I didn‚Äôt assume I would be making the drive, especially when I had just made the drive a week earlier

I made the trip after he asked, but every time we‚Äôve talked about it since then it goes in circles. He‚Äôs still firm on the belief that he shouldn‚Äôt have had to ask. I‚Äôm still firm on the belief that he shouldn‚Äôt get mad at me for not inherently having the same expectation.

I (20f) go to college and return back to my hometown during the summers. My hometown is about 150 miles away from my college. I do this because my family is kinda strict and expects me to return home as soon as I‚Äôm done with my classes. My boyfriend (22m) lives about 30 miles away from my college town year-round.

My boyfriend‚Äôs birthday occurs two weeks after I get out of school and head home. His birthday is on a Tuesday. He‚Äôs taking summer classes and has a part-time job.

A few weeks before his birthday, I give him one of his gifts and throw in a comment about how I‚Äôm giving it early because I won‚Äôt be in town for his birthday. He gets a little quiet at this, and later explains to me that he expected I would be there on his birthday. I‚Äôm a bit surprised and I explain to him that I wasn‚Äôt expecting it since I was returning back to my hometown during the summer.

I called my ex husband (who was expecting to meet our son and I at our son's race in an hour) and advised him. He offered to come boost me as none of my neighbours were outside yet (aka obviously awake). He came, and when we got the car boosted the alarm went off and nothing we were doing was shutting it off. 
While he was looking up how to deactivate it (I don't have a key fob), my neighbour from 3 doors down came outside and appeared to shout something to me. 

~As a side note I have a good relationship with most of my neighbours but I've only seen this one in passing as they moved in fairly recently.~

 I called out that I hadn't heard her and she shouted louder ""You woke up the baby!"" And had an angry look on her face. 

I called back that I hadn't set the alarm off on purpose and was trying to sort it out. She kept yelling at me that she didn't care, to shut it off, that people were sleeping etc. (All completely illogical things to say)
I repeated that I hadn't set it off for entertainment and to go back to bed. 
(During this we had found a hack to turning it off, which briefly worked until my son opened a door and it went off again).
All the time she is yelling at me and I tell her to shut up, piss off, etc. because she's being both unhelpful and illogical. 

Now here is where I become a bit of an asshole - I ran to get the spare key to try the hack from the outside of the car (locking and unlocking the doors) and she's come towards me more to yell, and I called her a stupid wh*re. Well clearly that hit a nerve because it sent her on a whole new path of yelling and she actually approached me to the point of setting foot on my property. 

We exchanged more heated words with mine essentially admonishing her to try using her brain/critical thinking skills the next time she sees someone is clearly struggling with something, told her to eff off, grow up, and left. 

When we came home a few hours later she was sitting on her stoop, and while I was speaking to my next door neighbour about the alarm etc (didn't mention the extra drama) I heard her clearly going on to someone about me and specifically what I had called her. 

Now normally I'm a pretty accommodating person. If she had offered help, or even waited to say to me hey that woke up the baby when we got it shut off, I would have apologized and probably offered her a coffee or something. Instead her aggression turned me intantly defensive and then reactive.

I (31, M) live alone in a lower-income neighborhood that is made up of a number of 2- 3- and 4plex rental properties.  I work from home from 10 to 6 M-F (9 to 5 but I'm one time zone east).

Across the street from me, there is a 2-bedroom apartment with 7 people in it to include a guy we'll call Billy. When I first met him, he looked to be about 80 or so. He waved me down one day and he asked if I could pick him up a pack of smokes. I said I could, and he handed me a $10 bill. This continued for a few days until the end of the month was approaching. He waved me over again and said he didn't have any money, so I said, ""Yeah, I can spot you for a pack"" knowing I'd be fine for a week.

Two weeks later, his money was dried up. He walked his way over to my front door and rang the bell. I ask what's up, and he asks if I can pick him up a couple of packs and ""I'll git ya some muh-nee on the first."" I tell him, ""Yeah, I can do it, but this is the last time because I'm on a budget this month; I need to buy a new washing machine. And, Billy, I work from 10 to 6 every day, and I'm in a lot of phone meetings, so please wait until you see me to wave me over, okay?""

The next night, he's hanging out on the deck at my other neighbor's house. Chuck. I learn from Chuck that Billy is only 66 and has been asking all of the neighbors for smokes, promising to pay everyone back.

I'm in a meeting, so I have to go,"" and I just shut the door and got back to the meeting. My boss asked me, ""Do you just chat with your neighbors all day?"" and I replied, ""No, just one when he wants me to buy him cigs cuz he can't drive.""

Anyways, after work, I got groceries and his smokes. I walked them over to Billy and said, ""Listen, I can't buy you smokes anymore. I got in trouble at work today because you pulled me out of a meeting. Don't ask me to buy you cigarettes again, okay?"" 

Fast forward to twenty minutes ago and he rings my doorbell again. He asked me if I could ""help \[him\] out with a couple packs until \[he's\] paid"" and by blood pressure spiked. ""Billy, you're interrupting me at work , and I already said I'm not buying you cigarettes anymore."" He's quite taken aback.

I live at home with my parents, though most of the year I live in a town a few hours away for University, and I am currently working in an office in London with my dad. My boyfriend rents a flat in another town around 1-1.5hr drive away from mine.

The train fair from the town my boyfriend lives in to London is actually cheaper than from my hometown, and the train is direct to the underground station right beside my Dad's office. The train station I would get from my boyfriend's town is also like a 10min walk away from his flat.

This is in comparison to the 25 min walk I do from my house to the station, 1hr train to Waterloo then a 40min walk to the office... all for a higher train fair + underground costs if I choose to take it. 

And now my parents are incredibly upset i guess?? I sent the text to the family gc informing them of my plans, my dad never responded and left at the end of the day without me and without even telling me (every single day we travel home together). I called my mum up (she asked me to) and I told her that their reaction is incredibly immature... especially as there isn't actually a valid reason why not to stay at my bfs... at least not one that they have given me. I then said the silent treatment they do is very immature, my mum asked for examples which i gave and she hung up on me.

I want to clarify that generally me and my parents have a very close relationship, except for when it comes to spending time with me boyfriend. The only reason they give me is because they want to spend more time with me, but I am almost always at home? Probably 70-80% of the time I am at home. It isn't like they don't like my boyfriend either, they're always chatting and laughing with him, he treats them with respect and cooks for them too. On top of that he treats me absolutely amazingly so it cant be out of concern?

My boyfriend is currently at my house with my mum and he says she is really not happy but doesn't say why, just that she doesn't like it.

The job I do in London is full time and includes many of my weekends over the summer to work at festivals so I am really not going to manage to see my boyfriend much at all over summer... and while at uni we live even further away.

On top of this my boyfriend is going through a very very very hard time with unrelated traumatic experiences so I obviously want to be there for him?

I want to clarify that generally me and my parents have a very close relationship, except for when it comes to spending time with me boyfriend. The only reason they give me is because they want to spend more time with me, but I am almost always at home? Probably 70-80% of the time I am at home. It isn't like they don't like my boyfriend either, they're always chatting and laughing with him, he treats them with respect and cooks for them too. On top of that he treats me absolutely amazingly so it cant be out of concern?

My boyfriend is currently at my house with my mum and he says she is really not happy but doesn't say why, just that she doesn't like it.

The job I do in London is full time and includes many of my weekends over the summer to work at festivals so I am really not going to manage to see my boyfriend much at all over summer... and while at uni we live even further away.

On top of this my boyfriend is going through a very very very hard time with unrelated traumatic experiences so I obviously want to be there for him?

I am really not trying to sound biased here, I'm not intentionally missing anything out because I genuinely want to understand their reasoning and if IATA for going?",0.0,0.05893408879637718,0,1

Well, my husband and I are expecting our first child together (we also share a daughter from his first marriage and this is IMPORTANT to the story) so his family is giving me a baby shower. I am very much not on very good speaking terms with either aunt. When my (step) daughter was 3, one of them threw a cooler at her at a family cookout because my daughter had her hands in the ice in the cooler and I told her to stop multiple times. My aunt got mad at ME for stopping her so she poured out the ice and threw the cooler and it almost hit my kid. Now that my daughter is 5, she had expressed to me that the aunts make her uncomfortable and that she doesn‚Äôt like that they are mean. Every time they see her, they try to make my daughter hug them and are very forceful. So we pretty much cut all contact with them.

96,1dsyv0n,AITA for not encouraging my niece (3F) to play with a random kid,"I (24F) am childfree and I don't have too much experience with small kids,so Reddit pls help. It's a silly problem but I can't stop thinking about it.

My niece (Mia, 3F) is and always was a very introverted and shy child. She daydreams a lot, likes to play alone or with people she knows and trusts. Even for me, it took time to befriend her so she would be comfortable interacting with me. Aside from adult family members she trusts, she has like 3 close friends and 2 nephews of her age.

Yesterday I was babysitting her in the park when a girl (4F) came to us and wanted to play with Mia. I checked with Mia if it's ok and she said we all can play together but I have to stick close to her. Fair enough. So we all played for 20-30 minutes (we made some sand sculptures, I helped both girls on some climbing frames etc). The other girl was very chatty, loud, kinda demanding and not always great with boundaries (she ate some of Mia's food without asking), I mean, probably just a normal kid of her age, but I could see Mia getting a bit upset after a while. So I checked with her again and she said she would like to play just with me.

So I said to the other girl, that we thank her for a good time, but now me and Mia would like to be on our own and I wish her to find a new playdate soon (there were at least 7 other parents with kids). I thought that was the end of it, but no.

A minute later this girl comes again with a furious mother, who starts screaming about how unfair I am to her kid. I try to tell her my side of the story, but another mom overhears and takes her side. According to them Mia is spoiled and I shouldn't trust her judgement and push her to be with other kids more or she will struggle at school.

I think the start of school is 3 years (so literally her whole life) away, so she has plenty of time to learn to socialize more & it's not like she can't make friends. She just said she would rather play with me than with a random girl she just met. I feel like that's not a crazy demand and it's awesome she can advocate for herself.

Last week I moved into an apartment on the floor below. We recently renovated a small section of the apartment as it was in really bad condition, but are on pause due to low funds. The apartment still has lingering sawdust, boxes of equipment, half a kitchen and a big hole in the ceiling. It‚Äôs not in a condition where it could be rented out.

For 1y Adam was my tenant, we met frequently (until uni started & I joined AIESEC where I was discriminated, so I left later - Adam knew about it), but Sam was still a better friend. After Adam moved, Sam gave me a ticket for Museums' Night. Turned out Adam also wanted to go, but he wasn't asked in the first place & I had no idea about it until later

I got a ticket from Sam this year too; Adam didn't. He works at my university, so I visited him a lot. He is quite hot-tempered & dislikes people, so he is constantly distressed. He seldom complained about the ticket, but I averted the topic - I didn't tell him I got one from Sam

Adam messaged me on the day:

* Did Sam give you a ticket
* Have you asked for one?
* Answer my question
* Yes
* Fine. F u.
* There's nothing I could do. Sam would rather be with me
* You shouldn't have said that
* Sorry, but this is what it is
* You know what...
* Sorry, it ain't my fault. You got what you came for
* Y'know, once? 'kay. Twice? I won't forgive. I wouldn't have expected it from you doing it twice. I truly loved you, as a friend, but it's over 
* Perhaps my replies were savage, but this 'answer my question' triggered me 'cause it is THE one thing that had been said in the past year lots when someone used me as a tool of stress relief. Now you are angry with Sam giving ME a ticket, so you must hate on me because he didn't act like you wanted? Nothing's wrong about what happened: Sam had a ticket, he offered to me 'cause it was fun last time. You may be cousins, but he can decide who to give it to. You shouldn't expect Sam to just give that one ticket he could offer. If it infuriates you, you deserve not getting it 'cause it's selfish to claim it on the basis of kindred. I asked Sam if could offer you one tho', but what else can I do? Reject the ticket? He has the right to give it to someone else & you wouldn't have gotten it. & I wanted the ticket too. Should I have given it to you? That'd of been the worst thing to do because Sam didn't want to give it to you. Maybe it's uncomfortable that I am the one to get the ticket, however, the true Aness is not from me, nor is it from Sam, but you. You have lost your 'trust' because you think he should've given it to you because you're cousins; you're selfish & jealous. Consider my message & respond when your mind is in its place. I tolerate a lot, but getting hated on for little to no reason is not a thing that I bear
* Shame on you, A. I know that Sam's like that, so I'm not mad at him. Disappointing. you hurt me twice the same way, but yeah, I am jealous, but it's you being selfish. The difference between us is that I constantly fight against my nature & you don't. & if you think that I am angry with Sam, F u.

Background: Our university is known as a major party school and my bf used to attend parties often before he met me. After we became exclusive with each other we agreed out of respect for each other, we would not attend any party without the other. If him and I wanted to go out, he would swap his phones because his parents (who do not condone partying) track his location on one of his phones. I would also like to mention my bf has a lot of friends whom are women and I am fine with that as long as nothing happened between them (the reason I mention this is because before him and I started dating, he would flirt with other women and sometimes it got sexual). My bf has a main instagram page and a gym instagram page because he is aspiring to be a gym influencer. I fully support him and have always been helping him out in the background and I say in the background because he does not want me seen by the public on his gym account, but I pretty much do things like cook for him to make sure he gets the right macros and I help set up his videos.

The main reason I suggested trading instagram passwords is because I know it would help reassure the both of us, especially me.

A few months ago, another woman ‚Äò20/F‚Äô from our university privately messaged me on instagram with screenshots that my boyfriend was cheating on me by asking other women for sexual favors or to send girls to his dorm. I ended up forgiving him and getting back with him but I gained major trust issues, anxiety, and overthought everything. We often talked about our future together after college, moving in, kids, etc. But we recently spoke about what we would do for his last year in college since I would not be able to see him everyday. Thats where I made the suggestion. He told me he was not comfortable with the idea and straight up told me ‚Äúno‚Äù. I always respected his boundaries but this time I was really upset.

104,1dsxppa,AITA for treating an unknown messenger like a romance scammer?,"Last week I got a random whatapp message from an unknown number. Their profile picture is an attractive young woman and they're asking if I'm free later. I politely tell them they have the wrong number. They then reply expressing how embarrassed they are. I reply saying no problem, assuming that's the end of it.
Then she asks where I live. I think to myself oh here we go, some weird romance trap is being set. I should have probaly just ignored and dipped, but I guess I get a kick out of messing around with cold callers and (if it is actually the woman from the pfp) shes quite hot so I go along with it. I avoid the question and ask her directly if she's trying to scam me. She says that she's not trying to scam me, she was just going to offer to buy me a coffee for ""inconveniencing"" me. 

We chat and flirt for the next day. It's fun however she starts asking a few too many personal questions for someone I've never met. I keep playfully suggesting that she's running a scam hoping to get a rise or a confession. She claims her innocence and shares a video of herself. An attractive young woman blowing a kiss to the camera. Maybe, maybe not the person from pfp. Chatting continues for the next day or so.

Eventually, I video call them. A woman answers, is it the same person from the video? I cant really tell. Admittedly we are both very flustered at seeing each other for the first time. 
I go full panic Batman mode and perhaps less playfully than I would have liked, start rattling off questions if shes at the scammer call centre, if her manager is behind her, etc. She's saying that she can't hear me well and generally just looks very confused. She hangs up after about a minute. That didn't go as I had planned (I had a plan??) and I've clearly just made another human pretty uncomfortable. Not cool, thats not what im about and it wasn't what I intended. 

There's radio silence for the remainder of the day and I sort of rationalise it as they're more than likely trying to scam me. Fuck how they feel, fuck them. But I sleep on it and despite my questionable rationale I still feel bad about what I did. So the next day I message them again. After a lengthy delay, she replies and tells me to quit messaging her. She's upset after all of my accusations. I apologise and respect her wish to quit messaging. 

So now I'm sat here thinking fuck have I just been a huge dick to a normal person just seeking out a connection? While a small part of me is saying no fuck them, chances are high that this person was trying to run some scam. Either way, truth be told, I feel pretty terrible. 

TL:DR Against my better judgement chatting and flirting with unknown messenger who I suspect is a romance scammer. In an attempt to see who is behind the messages, I video call. It goes horribly after a flurry of loaded questions. Unknown caller is clearly hurt by the confrontation.Tells me to get lost. Me feel horrible and confused. AITA?

Edit: One helpful comment and one John Oliver video later, I have been a victim of a pig butchering scam. I am a fool but now I am informed. Stay safe out there, gang!

Edit 2: I should just mention that no money was taken. She didn't even get to the bit where she asks for money. I appreciate everyone reassuring and sharing their experiences.

Then, I started trying dating and met an amazing guy, we really hit it off. But, he thought I needed therapy before we could be anything more, because I had clear issues - mainly he told me that I erased myself to make sure everyone else was happy, and he didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with someone that would always want whatever he wanted.



That's beside the point, me and him lost contact after a while, but what he said made me notice that I indeed have a lot of o issues, so a year or so ago I decided to start therapy.



Since the beginning my sister has been really against it and always brings it up asking ‚Äúif i‚Äôm still doing the therapy thing‚Äù.



The problem is, now my therapist gave me the challenge of saying no to things that make me uncomfortable. My sister asked me to go out with her and some friends of hers on saturday to celebrate the month of her birthday - her bday is july 19 so is not really the official celebration. I don‚Äôt really know any of them and felt uncomfortable, so said no but told her we could go out on sunday.



My sister asked me why i said no and i told her all of this. She flipped out, tho. She told me she always knew that I would end up choosing to hear a random person over her and now I was being just like my parents, and not being that for her important moments. She told me she refused to have another person like mom and dad in her life, and if i didn't choose her she didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me.



I told her the choice was clear and that my therapist clearly cared more about me than her.



I‚Äôm a mess right now, haven‚Äôt stopped crying since. My sister isn‚Äôt talking to me, I tried calling ang dming her and she blocked me. Some friends in common of ours reached out and told me I was an asshole, that I could do a small thing for my sister, but choose this hill to die on.



I honestly feel like the biggest asshole also. At the end of the day, my sister also has traumas from our childhood, and maybe I made them worst. The worst part is that my mom heard about our fight and told me that I was right, I should always choose myself. And if she is on my side, probably I‚Äôm wrong.

She told me she refused to have another person like mom and dad in her life, and if i didn't choose her she didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me.



I told her the choice was clear and that my therapist clearly cared more about me than her.



I‚Äôm a mess right now, haven‚Äôt stopped crying since. My sister isn‚Äôt talking to me, I tried calling ang dming her and she blocked me. Some friends in common of ours reached out and told me I was an asshole, that I could do a small thing for my sister, but choose this hill to die on.



I honestly feel like the biggest asshole also. At the end of the day, my sister also has traumas from our childhood, and maybe I made them worst. The worst part is that my mom heard about our fight and told me that I was right, I should always choose myself. And if she is on my side, probably I‚Äôm wrong.

108,1dsx1zo,AITA for putting away the chocolate mousse?,"Some backstory: My wife has this thing where if we're sharing food, she gets upset if I don't ask her if she's done before I put it away. I do my best to remember this preference of hers, but also don't understand why someone would be so upset by such a thing. Also, my wife and I have been fighting a lot lately (see my previous post). 

More info: I have been unemployed for over 7 months, earnestly looking for work every day. Our issues started before we got married over 2 years ago but have gotten worse and worse over time. I do not suspect my wife of cheating on me because we are pretty much always together. 

Last night, my wife (34f) and I (31m) made chocolate mousse. This morning, she brought the bowl of mousse out of the fridge and was enjoying some for a few minutes. After I finished my cereal, I came over to the mousse to have some myself. My wife cleaned off her spoon, handed it to me, and started doing dishes. I ate for a few minutes, then started to put the plastic wrap back on the bowl when I was done. My wife passive-aggressively said, ""That's fine, I guess I was done eating that."" Confused, I told her that I thought she was done eating since she cleaned her spoon and walked away from the bowl. I took the plastic wrap off and said it's no big deal, she can eat some more if she wants. She remained irritated and refused to eat any more before leaving the room.

Shortly after, she demanded an apology from me for not asking her if she was done before I put the plastic wrap back on the bowl. I told her that it was a simple misunderstanding and I didn't think I really did anything wrong. I told her I had good intentions and that if she had just approached the situation with curiosity and gentleness (for example, gently telling me that she would like some more mousse before I put it away), then there wouldn't have been a problem. I gently asked her to refrain from being passive aggressive with me. She went on to say that this has been a problem before and obviously I don't care about her wants, seemingly justifying her passive aggression. I told her that I do my best to keep her preferences in mind, but I, too, have wants, including wanting to be spoken to with respect and gentleness, especially when I did not have bad intentions. I said that if she approached situations like these with curiosity instead of anger, we would never fight. She replied that I was blaming her for all of our fights, maintaining a harsh and aggressive tone, then started raising her voice and told me to leave the room. I did. 

I could hear her crying from the other room, so I brought her a tissue and kissed her on the head as a show of peace and love before leaving again.

I‚Äôm 44 and in my second marriage. I‚Äôve been married to my second husband for less than a year. He has two kids (ages 10 and 12) and I have two (ages 12 and 17).

We recently drove up for my sister in laws wedding. My parents always insist we stay with them because they want to see their biological grandkids.

Initially I was hesitant about my stepkids staying because my parents had made comments such as ‚Äúwe want you to be in charge of his kids because of their nut allergies/[fill in excuse here].‚Äù But when we arrived, they did their best to acommodate all the kids, even throwing a bday for my stepson who they barely knew. 

During our stay, both my parents were waking up early and making breakfast and lunch for the kids, despite my telling them there was no need because my husband and I could do it. Even when I tried to make French toast, my mom asked me to stop because I was messing it up. So she insisted on doing everything but at the same time, she had a severe leg pain and was also not sleeping at night because the pre teen girls were all staying awake till 3 am. Mind you, it was my mom‚Äôs insistence that the girls sleep in the bedroom next to hers because she wanted my step kids to sleep in the basement next to their dad and myself.

We tried to eat out, order in, take the kids to my in laws house‚Äî all in order to lessen the burden on my mom. But she herself cooked huge buffet style spreads several days and my 80 year old dad woke up every morning at 6/7 am to make muffins and croissants for all the kids. We never asked them to do this. 

By the end of 10 days, my mom had exhausted herself and I felt like she was doing a lot of these formalities so that my husband wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúmy in laws didn‚Äôt treat us right‚Äù. Forgive me but part of me felt like they were going all out to save face.

Nevertheless we always said thank you. My husband and I are both somewhat stoic so our ‚Äúthank you‚Äù tends to be calm and not gushing or over exuberant.

On the last night, the kids all freaked out about seeing two ‚Äúcockroaches‚Äù ( I doubt it was roaches but still). Kids made noise at 1 am. My parents had yet another sleepless night. 

All the kids slept on one bed that night instead of the bedroom plan my mom had arranged (she had assigned sleeping for each of the kids).

The following morning, my parents were banging and moving tables at 6 am. My husband asked me if it was deliberate, maybe as retaliation for the kids keeping them up. 

I went upstairs and asked if someone was moving tables at 6. My mom responded with ‚Äúyou said you were leaving at 6‚Äù. I was annoyed, because that proved to me that it was deliberate. She then pointed at the spread on the table and said breakfast was ready. I should have said thank you but I was annoyed at the table thing. I said ‚Äúwe will grab breakfast on the road‚Äù.

Then, my 10 year old stepson came upstairs and  told my parents he saw bugs at night. My parents flipped out. 

They told us that they had done so much on this trip for us and on the last day, all we could say was that there were bugs. 

My husband apologized and said kids will be kids. I thanked them for all they did but told them not to take a kid personally.

113,1dswbtk,AITA for making people change lanes at the bowling alley?,"I (28 F) cannot bowl to save my life. I've only been a few times, and I'm uniformly terrible. Weirdly enough, I get strikes 10% of the time and gutterballs the other 90%, with no in between. People have offered to teach me, but I've decided I'm comfortable with being Really That Bad. Yes, this is relevant.

Last night, my boyfriend Aneesh (28) and I decided to go bowling because the local place was having an all-you-can-bowl night. We were assigned to a lane next to a group of five women and one man (late 40s?). They were on the left; we were on the right. The lanes have two big tables each, one of which was farther back and up a small set of stairs. Aneesh and I had both gotten a beer, and when we went to set our drinks down on the table next to the lanes, the man in the neighboring group quickly informed us that it was *their* table. We said ""No worries, sorry"" and walked up the stairs to the other one.

After a few (bowling) rounds, I was sipping my beer while waiting for the ball-spitty-outy-thingy and then put the drink down without thinking. The man once again told me that it was their table, and they'd reserved it. I said, ""Oh whoops,"" and grabbed my drink. I returned to Aneesh and quietly said, ""I mean, the table is theirs for however long they reserved it, so whatever, but they're being weirdly intense about it. What do you think is up?"" Aneesh and I speculated it was a birthday party, but there were no gifts/cake/balloons. It's just a table, so we didn't make an issue of it.

Later, I went to throw, but my fingers stuck in the holes. My ball went to the left and ended up in the neighboring lane--gutterball. I immediately apologized profusely to the group. A bunch of people nearby saw my wild throw and started laughing. I waved at them and took a little bow to show there were no hard feelings, but I was definitely embarrassed. Aneesh promised me that it happens sometimes, even to good bowlers.

Well, the group didn't accept my apology. The man said, ""Go ahead and use our table, since you're determined to ruin our good time."" I replied, ""I'm really sorry I bowled in your lane. I promise I didn't do it intentionally. You can take one of my turns if you want.""

Long story short, the group reported us to the employees. I have no idea for what--we didn't find out until we were paying our bar tab and the bartenders we'd heavily tipped told us the gossip. The employees made the group switch to a different lane while Aneesh and I were left with their table. I would be lying if I said I didn't feel a little smug about it after they were such bad sports, but in their defense, Aneesh wanted to leave ten minutes later. It seems wrong for us to ""make"" six people move when the two of us were almost finished.

A bunch of people nearby saw my wild throw and started laughing. I waved at them and took a little bow to show there were no hard feelings, but I was definitely embarrassed. Aneesh promised me that it happens sometimes, even to good bowlers.

Well, the group didn't accept my apology. The man said, ""Go ahead and use our table, since you're determined to ruin our good time."" I replied, ""I'm really sorry I bowled in your lane. I promise I didn't do it intentionally. You can take one of my turns if you want.""

Long story short, the group reported us to the employees. I have no idea for what--we didn't find out until we were paying our bar tab and the bartenders we'd heavily tipped told us the gossip. The employees made the group switch to a different lane while Aneesh and I were left with their table. I would be lying if I said I didn't feel a little smug about it after they were such bad sports, but in their defense, Aneesh wanted to leave ten minutes later. It seems wrong for us to ""make"" six people move when the two of us were almost finished.

114,1dsvq8h,AITA for not including my roommate in my BF's birthday dinner?,"I (25F) have been living with two roommates, a girl and a guy (let's call him Guy), for about a year. I didn't know them before moving in. The girl has a completely different schedule from us, so we barely see her. Guy and I get along fine. We're not best friends, but we hang out occasionally, either alone or with each other's friends.

Throughout the year, we developed an unwritten agreement: he buys the food for both of us, and I cook for both of us. It's a win-win situation. He gets healthy, home-cooked meals and probably saves money since he used to eat out all the time. I save a lot of money, and it‚Äôs not a hassle to cook for two instead of one - if anything, I think it feels easier.

The other day, my boyfriend (whom I've been dating for about three months\* (edit - oops! I wrote three years but I meant three months\*\*) had a birthday. I wanted to make something special for him, so I bought fresh, high-quality ingredients to make a three-course meal for us. I followed recipes for two and bought only the amount I needed. We celebrated on the balcony, and it was a lovely time. When I was in the kitchen doing the final prep to serve dessert, Guy came home from work and said he smelled amazing food from the hallway. I told him what was going on, and he asked if I had made a serving for him as well. I felt a bit bad and told him that I only bought ingredients for two servings but that there was good food I made the day before in the fridge, and if there were any leftovers, he could obviously have some. He just said, ""Oh,"" and went to his room. It felt awkward and uncomfortable, but when I went back to my boyfriend, he said it would be ridiculous for Guy to think I would consider him while making a birthday meal for my boyfriend.

The next day, Guy seemed sulky and distant, so I asked him if we could talk. He told me he was very hurt and couldn't believe that the one time I bought ingredients, I didn't think of him. He said that if it were him, he would never leave me out like that and that I was selfish and self-centered. I thought it was unfair because it sounded like he was doing me a favor all along when we both benefited from the arrangement. In the heat of the moment, I told him that from now on, each of us would buy and make food for ourselves, and he agreed. It's been a few days, and on one hand, I want to make things right between us because- well, the arrangement was beneficial, but also the vibe at our place is very heavy and unpleasant and I do genuinely care for him as a person and a friend. On the other hand, I feel like I wasn't in the wrong, and it's hard for me to swallow my pride and apologize.

I would love to hear a wider perspective, so what do you think? AITA?

This may be long but details are needed. 

My husband's mom and I do not have a good relationship. Actually I shouldn't say ""not good."" We have a horrible relationship. My husband and I have been together 14 years, married for 10 in August and the things she's done throughout include calling us bad parents, saying we neglect our kids, said she was going to take us to court, came to our house yelling and screaming at us (with a 2 week old in the house and post csection) and so many other things. She's tried to tell me things ""my mom told her"" about me using my husband but told me all this after my mom passed away. (I know my mom wouldn't say that because she didn't even like his mom) There have been plenty of times she's talked crazy to me and I kept forgiving her until I had enough. The last time we talked was Christmas 2016 and that was the last time because she showed up at our house trippin again.

She told my oldest, 12, in October who was super excited about Halloween and her costume, she was too old to be out for Halloween and her trick or treating needs to stop.  She basically called my daughter a liar when she told my husband and I about a convo her and her grandmother had. She's told both of my kids they don't have to run back and tell us everything she says to them.

My middle child who is currently 7 said maybe a year ago she ""doesn't like going to mom mom's house because she doesn't like when she yells at daddy.""

My kids haven't seen her since September per my decision. I have a 16m old who she has seen maybe twice when my husband took him to see her because she is not allowed in my house. My girls have recently asked to go to her house because she has stuff for them and my husband will casually say he's going to take them to her house here and there to which I do not allow.

However, due to him moving abroad and conflicts over an inheritance, we no longer talk these days. 

Recently, I've been receiving calls from various local and overseas relatives asking for financial help for my cousin. He has defaulted on his house payments and is more than six months behind on mortgage and loan repayments because his wife [native Chinese] convinced him to buy a house in Shanghai. He [ABC, by the way] had a good job in what should have been a stable company, but the virus f'ed them hard, and he has never recovered. Apparently, it seems he got laid off eight months ago. 

When we were still talking, and he told me that he was going to buy this ludicrously expensive 2.8 million RMB house (about 400k USD) that was basically a concrete box. I told him he was insane and would regret it for many reasons, but particularly because he would never actually own the place due to Chinese laws. Now, four years later, he still owes nearly 2 million RMB on his mortgage since his payments have only been covering the interest, and near an additional 1 million RMB in loans for the decorations used to make that naked concrete box a place you can live in. 

I am a teacher in the US, and I don't earn enough money to own my own damn house, so how am I supposed to give someone else money to pay off theirs when I warned them this would come back to bite them HARD? In the Chinese real estate market, you are always just one bad day or one conman away from losing three generations of savings. This house was so expensive (for him) that it took up 70% of his monthly income just to pay the interest on the mortgage. 

Now, I am being harassed for his stupidity to help him out of this hole because I let on that I had a decent savings account. It's not house money, but I want to buy a new new car; something nice for once and not just new to me. Even my biological family is giving me grief about this. But I don't want to help. 

Will I be the asshole if I don't help them?

Edit: Thanks for the comments and reassurance, Asian family guilt is a crazy WMD on it's own. Yea so they are trying get everyone to ""donate"" to cousin.

Now, four years later, he still owes nearly 2 million RMB on his mortgage since his payments have only been covering the interest, and near an additional 1 million RMB in loans for the decorations used to make that naked concrete box a place you can live in. 

I am a teacher in the US, and I don't earn enough money to own my own damn house, so how am I supposed to give someone else money to pay off theirs when I warned them this would come back to bite them HARD? In the Chinese real estate market, you are always just one bad day or one conman away from losing three generations of savings. This house was so expensive (for him) that it took up 70% of his monthly income just to pay the interest on the mortgage. 

Now, I am being harassed for his stupidity to help him out of this hole because I let on that I had a decent savings account. It's not house money, but I want to buy a new new car; something nice for once and not just new to me. Even my biological family is giving me grief about this. But I don't want to help. 

Will I be the asshole if I don't help them?

Edit: Thanks for the comments and reassurance, Asian family guilt is a crazy WMD on it's own. Yea so they are trying get everyone to ""donate"" to cousin. All of this is because one auntie overheard me talking about getting a new car and they all started circling like vultures, and the guilt has been raining for days. ",0.0,0.01500436756759882,0,1
121,1dsuoa0,AITA for defending my wife? ,"
I [M40] have been with my wife [F35] for 13 years, married 11 and 1/2. She has a son [M17] with her ex-hubby [M36]. I'll call him Johnny. When Johnny was born, my wife (Janet) was only 18. It was a difficult time for her. She married the baby's papa (Max). It wasn't easy for Janet to be such a young mother. She divorced Max when Johnny was about 4. Max get full custody of him. Janet continued to visit Johnny on weekends, she gave him gifts for the holidays, she tried to remain a good mom. Although the boy was still closer to his father. Janet married me almost immediately after her divorce (for those who will be wondered: yes, when I met Janet, she was married, but they was around the divorce). We had 3 children together. 

A month ago, Janet confessed how much she misses Johnny. She used to have a rather cool relationship with her son, but she honestly wanted to grow closer with him. She invited Johnny to visit our house. 

Johnny was a cheerful and good guy. Our 2 monht old, Maya, just melted his heart. He adores our youngest daughter. He plays with her a lot and she has started to smile when she sees him and when he talks to her. 

My wife invited Johnny to stay with us for a few weeks. Max was against it at first, but Johnny talked him into it. 

The first two weeks went well. Friday night we were sitting in the living room watching TV. There was a movie on about a first love. My wife told a joke about her son's relationship with his girlfriend. Everybody laughed. But Johnny blushed a little. He asked how his mom knew about his girlfriend. Janet denied it at first and then admitted that she had read his messages with his girlfriend when he left his phone on the kitchen counter.

I know you will wonder, so I'll tell you right off the bat: I don't think kids (even teenagers) should be allowed access to gadgets without adult supervision. 

Johnny tried to be stubborn. He said that Janet ""had no right to check his phone and read his messages with his girlfriend"", and ""why did you tell about my girlfriend in front of everyone"". Janet got upset and said that she didn't mean any harm. 
I stood up for Janet. I told Johnny that his mom was worried about him and that she had a right to know about his life and he should apologize to her. 

At Sat, Johnny went back to his father's house, as he was supposed to. On Sat night Max called us out of the blue and started yelling at us. He yelled that we had no right to touch Johnny's stuff without permission. Max also said that not us but he bought phone to Johnny, so it wasn't our place to ""control"" it. But worst page was when he said about how my wife had hurt Johnny right in the heart with her joke (Johnny is like his father: he's tall but somewhat chubby, has a soft round face, and his girlfriend is short and very thin, she's what people call a ""girlie-girl""; my wife made a joke about it, saying that Johnny, like his father, chooses the exact opposite of himself).

Yesterday they went out together with me (30m) in a city about an hour and a half away. At first I didn't really want to go and figured it would be nicer for them to make it a girls day but my wife insisted and said they know and like me so it would be fine.

To be honest we ended up having fun untill it was time to go home. My wife asked me if I couldn't just pick the car which was about 20min. walk away. So i go and pick the car and by the time i got back there was no one there. I just texted my wife to ask where they were and she told me that it took a bit too long and they decided to have a cocktail while waiting for me. 

I went to the new adress which was not that easy to reach by car and texted again that I arrived there. Now my wife texted that they were having another drink because it took a bit longer than they thought and they would be out soon. It ended up taking another 15 minutes and when they came out they looked like they'd had a bit more than just 2 cocktails. 

So I drive everyone home, drop her friends in their places and get ourselves back home too. This is whek my wife said that the way things were with the car at the end was annoying. I felt relieved thinking that she would apologise but instead she insisted that next time I should just drop them off and come pick them when they were done. I was confused and asked her if she really expected me to drive 6 hours in a day so that she and her friends could have fun on their own. She admitted that it was what she expected i would offer today and that it was awkward that i tagged along. I got somewhat pissed at this and told her that she could have figured another way to get there and that I'm not her driver.

Hi there,

I have been due to attend a wedding of a good friend of mine I met in university. I know her and her soon to be husband fairly well. My friend has met my girlfriend maybe 2 or 3 times for drinks when we have all been out together.

Recently, my friend called me and stated that unfortunately she only wants to have close friends and family at the wedding, so my girlfriend would not be one of the people invited. I told her it‚Äôs her wedding and special day so it‚Äôs her decision who attends. I told her I will let my girlfriend know.

I told my girlfriend about this and she got really upset. Saying ‚Äúyou should have stuck up for me and immediately told her you are not going if I‚Äôm not invited‚Äù.

She said it would be really shitty of me to attend the wedding without her. At this point it feels like I‚Äôm going to really hurt her feelings if I attend the wedding. On the other hand, I might really hurt my friend‚Äôs feelings if I say I‚Äôm not attending her big day. What are your thoughts on this?

Stacy and I grew quite close as friends because we mostly have the same character (rather introverted, nerdy, same classes and interests, and same friends). She is a reliable friend and you can tell her anything, and she's generally of good advice and listens whenever should I need. As we graduated college (back in 2019) our group split up, but Stacy had to go to Brittany (she's French, I'm Belgian) for her job and home as her parents owned a flat there that she could live in. Now, we keep in touch regularly via text message and sometimes live calls. I visited her with two other girls from our group with whom she was quite close to. It was a great holiday that I remember fondly.

However, time has passed, and the more I talk with Stacy, the more she's starting to sound like a broken record. You see, Stacy complains. *A lot.* 

But I get her. Stacy is the daughter of two French ambassadors, and as such always had to move on from one country to another, change schools, change friends, basically living like a nomad, and with seeing her parents maybe two times a year if she was lucky. My mom always told me to cut her some slack, and I agree, it's not an easy life.  

However, Stacy has doubled down on her complaining for a few months now. For example, she regularly says her job sucks and she hates it, that she hates her city and has no one to talk to (am I a joke btw?). When I try to offer her advice, she always has a good excuse. ""it's too expensive, I don't have time, I don't have holidays, I don't want to..."" to the point that whenever she complained, I started to leave her on read.

I'm currently in debt, and all my friends and my boyfriend knew about it. I have a good job and live alone. I pay my own rent, clothes, groceries, and debt, so my entire salary goes towards these expenses each month.

Because of my debt, I always said I'd spend my vacation this year in the city and not go on any trips. My boyfriend, who enjoys sailing, invited me on a sailing trip several months prior. The way he phrased it, it sounded like he would pay for it, especially since he knew my financial situation. He told me to just confirm my vacation dates at work so he could book the trip, which I did. I knew the trip costs about 1k plus plane tickets.

He booked everything in advance, and I was grateful. About a week before the trip, he told me there was an additional $450 contribution I needed to pay. I didn't expect that but said ok.

During the trip, the topic came up again. I calmly said I would have liked better communication about expenses in the future so I could plan my spending or decline the offer. This escalated into him saying I should have known the trip was expensive and that he expected me to pay the part. He said he only planned to pay the main fee. I answered that he should have mentioned this upfront, as I had no idea about this contribution existence as I‚Äôve never been on such trip. He then said he‚Äôs not a ""sugar daddy,"" this phrasing hurt me. 

He ended up paying this contribution (I tried to pay it quietly, but he came in during the discussion about it between me and skipper and didn't let me).  

Initially I didn't think much of him paying for the trip, as he earns 2x more than me, has no debt, and recently spent 2k on another sailing event to which he went by himself.

The rest of the trip was kind of ruined for me because of our discussion. I felt out of place and ashamed for going on a trip I couldn't afford. I believe it‚Äôs fair that I should have paid something and feel ashamed for not asking about it beforehand. I regret going and still feel stressed about it.

131,1dss02x,AITA for not eating fish?,"I (F31) have not eaten fish since I was 1 year old. By ""fish"", I mean anything from the sea - fish, shellfish, etc. I'm not allergic, but according to my parents, I got sick after eating fish once as a child, and have refused it ever since.

As a kid and teenager, the smell of fish would make me feel nauseous, so I'd avoid the kitchen when my family was cooking it. They would try to accommodate me by cooking fish when I wasn't around. When I moved to university and had to share a kitchen, I couldn't be as picky about the smells, and gradually got more used to it (though I still dislike the smell of raw or cooking fish).

Coming from a coastal town in Europe, fish is a very common part of the local cuisine. My friends and family have always been annoyed that I don't eat it. They constantly try to get me to try different fish and seafood dishes, insisting I'm ""missing out."" My family and boyfriend pressure me to just ""grow up"" and start eating fish. I've tried a few things like fried calamari, salmon, and canned tuna, but I remain disgusted by the idea of seafood.

I acknowledge this is a psychological aversion, not based on taste. I don't want to force myself to eat something I find so unappealing. People have all sorts of food preferences - why should mine about fish be an issue? I don't judge or impose my choices on others. At home, I simply don't buy or cook fish, but my boyfriend is free to enjoy it (and cook it himself). 

The main conflict is with my boyfriend (M 31). While fish isn't his favorite dish, he loves sushi and paella. Paella is typically for two people, so he was frustrated when we were in Spain and he couldn't order it. (This only happened in a trip with only the two of us, there were multiple other trips when we were with friends and he could have his paella). 

Now, as we plan a trip to Japan, he's pushing me to try sushi, which I really don't want to do. I'm happy for him to indulge in it, but I don't want to be forced. I might try a small piece to make him happy, but I know I'll never fully enjoy a sushi meal the way he wants. I am happy to spend a few meals separately, when he can go to a sushi restaurant and I can find somewhere else to eat. He says that I am being unreasonable and I should just start to eat fish; I say that he is being unreasonable, I am not preventing him to eat fish on this trip (or ever in life)

My son loves reptiles and had been begging me to let him get a pet snake for months now. He wanted a ball python. I vetoed that, but I did some research and told him that I would allow him to have a pet corn snake, since every source told me that they are docile and easy to care for. I bought and helped him set up the terranium and then we got the snake.

I did all this without talking to my husband first. I admit, I was going on the ""better to ask for forgiveness than permission"" model, but at the same time it's my house too, it was my money, and it was my son's room.

But here's the thing; his daughter is deathly afraid of snakes. She freaks out if she sees so much as a small garter snake out in the yard. I kind of blame my husband and his ex-wife for this. There are a lot of copperheads in our area as well as some rattlesnakes, but bites are rare and deaths from snake bites are basically unheard of. But my husband and his ex taught their daughter that snakes are scary and deadly and must be avoided. I get it; but they overdid it.

Anyway, my husband is unhappy with me and wants me to get rid of the snake. But I won't. There is no reason why my step-daughter will ever even have to look at the animal if she doesn't want to. But my husband says that just knowing that there is a snake in the house is setting his daughter on edge. He admits that her fears are irrational but says that she can't help it and that her mental health and comfort should be considered.

However, on the day we were supposed to leave, he could not come on time and eventually I had to go alone and wait for him there. He came after 50 minutes after I had reached. Before leaving I sensed that he is having trouble to leave and might be caught up in something personal and so I offered to go by myself and he insisted he will be there when I reach but didn‚Äôt and reached after 50 minutes.

 In our country it‚Äôs not common or even appropriate for women to stay and wait at the repair shop alone due to the fact that it‚Äôs a man‚Äôs job and women should not be seen outside alone without a male presence (archaic, I know). When he came he saw me in the waiting room and insisted I leave with him immediately so he can drop me home and would stay for the car himself. It‚Äôs my car and me asking him to come to accompany me already felt like a huge favour to ask and seeing him struggle to make it in time made me think I was asking for too much. So him asking me to leave just so I can stay at home and relax while he stays at the repair shop in the heat felt unreasonable and I felt embarrassed. So I kept insisting that I will stay there and kept saying no while he kept saying he‚Äôll drop me home. This back and forth happened ten times till he eventually left to check the car itself. 

Both of us didn‚Äôt share why we wanted to have it our way. 5 minutes later he came back and told me the car is fixed and we should go home now. When we reached home, he was fuming. 

He called me TA because: Firstly, that I should have said ok when he asked me to leave as that‚Äôs respecting his wishes and me saying no (like a child) was very entitled, bratty and disrespectful to him. I think I was not TA as I felt bad about making him do more for me when he was already clearly struggling from my favour. Secondly, he said we previously decided  mutually that he would take the lead in the relationship which he believes entails not asking further questions or rejecting his wishes irrespective of the reasons. I felt like I was only being considerate of him and should know the reasons for blindly trusting him on everything. Thirdly, he stated that had he felt burdened he would not have asked me to leave for home with him. Yet, he also said that he is not my slave and I should be more understanding if he is ever late.

In my opinion I don‚Äôt think I am TA as I was only being considerate of him and am entitled to feel disappointed since he was late but also did not communicate as to why.

I, on the other hand absolutely despise crowds and one of those people who would rather host a house party. I would rather spend twice the amount to have a house party and stream live videos than to go to a concert just to see some artist from really far away, but I get the fascination for a few people- to each their own! 
He knows how I feel about concerts since the beginning and after numerous discussions and how ‚ÄúIn relationships you need to sometimes compromise‚Äù we came to an understanding that I would go only if its an artist I really like. (I proposed it being an artist we both like but he said he doesnt mind anyone as long as he got to go to a concert with me)
An artist he has been a big fan of is hosting a concert in a few days and he asked me to come and told me how much it would mean to him. While I understand it would, I am really not comfortable with crowds and accidentally touching/being touched by random people. Its an artist I have never even really heard about. He tries to sweetly convince me saying how he will ‚Äúprotect me‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate a bubble around me‚Äù but we all know thats not how things work.

Should be fine for both of us! Thanks a lot guys ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-01,"AITA for turning down my boyfriend‚Äôs request to go to a concert? My (24,F) boyfriend (23,M) really likes concerts and would always tell me how, back when he was single, he used to wish to someday come to one with a partner because he finds it romantic. I, on the other hand absolutely despise crowds and one of those people who would rather host a house party. I would rather spend twice the amount to have a house party and stream live videos than to go to a concert just to see some artist from really far away, but I get the fascination for a few people- to each their own! 
He knows how I feel about concerts since the beginning and after numerous discussions and how ‚ÄúIn relationships you need to sometimes compromise‚Äù we came to an understanding that I would go only if its an artist I really like. (I proposed it being an artist we both like but he said he doesnt mind anyone as long as he got to go to a concert with me)
An artist he has been a big fan of is hosting a concert in a few days and he asked me to come and told me how much it would mean to him. While I understand it would, I am really not comfortable with crowds and accidentally touching/being touched by random people. Its an artist I have never even really heard about. He tries to sweetly convince me saying how he will ‚Äúprotect me‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate a bubble around me‚Äù but we all know thats not how things work.

We have traveled to multiple countries, with our last country being Sweden because she said it was cheaper for her to fly home from Sweden than our actual last destination (Spain). I am the only friend of hers that decided to come on this trip. 

While in Spain, I got a call from my family back in the US that my grandma wants to stop her cancer treatment and will probably pass before the end of July. I am distraught, but I wanted to finish this trip out fully since I couldn‚Äôt change my flight home to be earlier (only 3 more days), and for my friend. 

My friend has frequently done things on our vacation that have made me feel crappy and made it difficult to travel with her, such as telling me within our first 2 days that she finds many of the things I do annoying. 

She went out last night with a friend who was in the area, and I stayed in because my family had just rushed my grandma to the hospital for the 2nd time the past few days. She came back after midnight, and told me that she was going to move her flight to Sweden to land at 7pm, instead of the flight we booked together to leave at 10am to land at noon so that she could sleep in.  

We are only in Sweden for 2 days, and her landing at 7 basically puts the first day as a wash. I‚Äôm fine with solo-traveling, but with the news, this isn‚Äôt a time I wanted to be alone. I told her that I was shocked that she would move her flight not only without asking me about it, leaving me to take our original flight alone, but with the news I just got about my grandma, it would never cross my mind to leave a friend alone during this time just to sleep in, especially if they flew all the way to Europe for my birthday trip. 

I brought it up to her, and she doubled down and got upset at me for not wanted her to prioritize her wellbeing and for expecting her, in her eyes, to ask me for permission to change her flight.

137,1dsqeao,AITA for fake coming out to my parents and accidentally taking the attention away from my lesbian sister?,"I (M16) and my sister (F17) have always had a close relationship despite having different interests and me being the apparent golden child to our parents. I didn't realize this until she pointed it out a year ago. Since then, I've been trying to make our parents aware of their favoritism to make up for how neglected she must have felt. My sister usually appreciates this, but I think I might've gone too far.

Last month, my sister came out as a lesbian to our parents and received a negative reaction. I tried to support her, but during a conversation, she made a snide remark about how our parents would probably accept me if I came out. This got me thinking: what if I faked a coming out?

So, last month I ""came out"" as bisexual. My mom didn't believe me and asked how I knew. Panicking, I told her I was dating my friend Jeremy, who is actually gay. My parents then hugged me, expressing their support and asking to meet him. My mom got very emotional, and I couldn't bring myself to tell them it was a prank.

When my sister found out, she was upset and accused me of taking even more attention away from her and rubbing my golden child status in her face. She said it was insensitive and kicked me out of her room. She also warned me that coming clean now would be emotionally manipulative. I decided to follow her advice and live as bisexual for a month.

A few days later, I told Jeremy what had happened and asked him to play along if my parents asked about our ""relationship."" He agreed, and after a basketball game, my parents invited him to dinner. The dinner went well, and my parents didn't seem to suspect anything. However, my dad made a remark about how I could get a same-gender partner before my sister, which upset her and drove her to her room. My parents ignored her and continued chatting with Jeremy and me.

Eventually, my mom offered to pay for our dates, and we agreed, seeing it as a chance to repay Jeremy for his help and it would be generally fun. So we went on fake dates, and since we hadn't hung out one-on-one before, we got to know each other better. During this time, I started to feel attracted to him but am unsure if it's genuine or out of obligation. I plan to talk to him about it soon.

Yesterday, my sister finally talked to me and demanded I tell our parents it was a joke. She feels bad that our parents now see me as the better ""gay child."" I refused but didn't tell her I might actually be bisexual. She called me an a-hole and is ignoring me again. But I think it‚Äôs in my right to not ‚Äòcome clean‚Äô if I‚Äôm actually developing feelings for him.

145,1dsp39z,WIBTA if I didn't invite my best friend to my wedding?,"My fiance (26M) and I (24F) have been engaged for a few months now. My best friend (also 24F) has never been keen on him. We have been friends since 8th grade. I've asked many times why and she can never give me a real answer. We have been together for about 2 years now, and he's never done anything to hurt me or her.

And before anyone asks - I do know, for a fact, that he's never done anything to her. Him and I were discussing her aversion to him one day and he showed me all their text messages. Which was about 2 paragraphs worth of very short sentences between the two. As for in person interactions, they are never alone together.

Back to the actual story. Recently, I asked her again why she doesn't like him. She said a couple of reasons that don't concern her or make any sense to her dislike of him. She said that he's too needy towards me, dependant on me, less mature than me, and controlling. Only one of those is slightly true. He is slightly less mature than I am, despite him being older. He had a very sheltered childhood and teenhood until he was 19, while I grew up as a second mom in my house and a very rambunctious, outgoing teenager. My fiance is not needy or dependant on me. He likes affection and PDA, yes, but that doesn't make him needy or dependant. And he is, in no way, controlling. Just an example, I'm buzzing my hair in a couple months simply because I want to and while most men would dread it or even try to stop it, he's excited to help me dye cool designs in my hair.

This is all to say that I've gotten really fed up with her attitude towards him. Ignoring him, trying to borrow money from him when she has at least 300 in her bank account at all times, claiming she only likes him being around because he can drive us places, trying to isolate me from him, etc. I've told her off before but it doesn't stick with her.

146,1dsp19k,"AITA For ""Skimming Money off the Top"" from my Roommates' Grocery Share","I (24F) share an apartment with my two roommates/close friends - Nikki and Leah, we all make around the same and split rent equally. Nikki and Leah need to go into work everyday and I am mostly WFH, and, I happen to be a pretty good cook. So we all agreed that instead of eating out or hiring a maid/cook, they would each pay me 5K a month for groceries (so total 10K) and I would not contribute towards the household groceries cost, instead I would cook 2-3 meals daily for all of us, handle the kitchen cleanup, buy groceries etc. This has worked well for us for close to two years at this point. 

Now, sometimes in a month, there may be 1K to 3K left over from the 10K they Leah and Nikki have given me, sometimes I get a good deal, sometimes we just eat less. Instead of transferring this money back to them, I have been keeping a ""rainy-day"" apartment fund, to be used in case of emergencies. 

I may have screwed up by not telling them about this fund but that is because Nikki and Leah have a tendency to not save and spend every coin they get, plus it's not like any of us make a large amount of money anyways (we all make like 35K to 40K a month). If I told them about it, anytime there is a concert or a sale, they would demand it and spend it. 

Now over two years, this fund has grown to be about 45K, although it isn't life changing money, it is more than any of our monthly salaries and as fate would have it, the rainy day arrived yesterday. I am not very sure what happened but from what I gather, Nikki had been trying her hand at microwave cooking, using recipes from some 5 Min Crafts-esque video and completely sparked/burnt our microwave, which belonged to our landlord. 

Now we have to replace the same at out own cost and it is around 12K, and obviously, Nikki will pay for it as it was her fault. Nikki started to panic as she hasn't gotten her salary yet and she is broke. I told her and Leah that it was fine and I had a fund that was about 45K, Nikki could use her half of it to buy a new microwave. 

They went ballistic and accused me of making money off them and skimming money of the top. Neither of them are talking to me, I gave them all of the money. Was I really TA??

So my wife and her sister chose the name Katherine for our daughter instead and SILs son will be Alexander. I was hurt and more than a little peeved. My wife asked me why I had that expression on my face and I told her I was not okay with her naming our daughter with her sister instead of me. I told her we had chosen the name Adora. She never expressed second thoughts about the name. We were just working on a middle name.

I told her I had not expected that from her. That I thought she truly respected me and was excited to be on this journey together. She asked me if I was really that upset about it and I said yes. I told her I wouldn't lie and say I was okay with it. I told her she basically cut me out of the process in the end if she were to go ahead with this.

Prior to being kicked out from my brothers, my friend kept offering me her basement. So I ended up taking her up on that offer. I didn‚Äôt have a job at the time, but I was on welfare, so I contributed to food immediately, and then once I got a job, I started paying $450 rent every month. If Amy asked me for anything, I‚Äôd give her the money for it, or I‚Äôd do it. I 100% contributed to everything.

Amy would make comments here and there and tell me her sisters thought I was taking advantage of her‚Ä¶ and then I was suddenly costing her more for me living there, even though she was getting an extra $450 she never had before I moved in.

The basement was big, but I had no privacy, Amy and her kids would come down all of the time, while I‚Äôd be working or sleeping. There was never any consideration. Then she suddenly upped my rent from $450 to $650 because apparently, I was using too much hydro. (I‚Äôd sit in the dark down there all day and night, never having lights on, if I was working my computer was on, otherwise I‚Äôd have it off and just watch TV on my iPad.

¬†I had informed Amy, I was looking for an apartment because I felt like it was time for me to have my own space. At this point I was working 2 jobs, so I could afford it. Amy would make comments like, shes sad im leaving, she was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt get accepted for the place I applied for etc.

We didn‚Äôt end on bad terms. The only thing was‚Ä¶ I attempted to maintain the friendship, She only reached out when she wanted or needed something, and because I worked 2 jobs, I couldn‚Äôt watch her kids, or do whatever she asked me to do.

¬†I did end up In a depression, because my health issues that she was aware of, took over my life.

Have a good life üôÇ Idk what you thought this was, but it definitely didnt feel like a healthy friendship.~*

I was taken aback because when I lived with her, I never freeloaded, I constantly gave her money for things, I never complained when she upped my rent. We never argued or fought. And any communication when I left on her end was her asking me to do things I couldn‚Äôt do because of my responsibilities‚Ä¶ I never used her, I never sucked the niceness out of anyone.

I was taken aback because when I lived with her, I never freeloaded, I constantly gave her money for things, I never complained when she upped my rent. We never argued or fought. And any communication when I left on her end was her asking me to do things I couldn‚Äôt do because of my responsibilities‚Ä¶ I never used her, I never sucked the niceness out of anyone.

151,1dso4o4,AITA for no longer spending parenting time at my dad's because I was expected to share a room with my younger stepbrother?,"My parents divorced when I (15m) was 4. My memory of them together is really fuzzy and the normal to me is mom's house, dad's house. Mom's house always felt more like home to me though. But we live with my grandparents so maybe that's why and I always loved living with my grandparents. I'm really close to them. I never hated going to my dad's house though and we were close until Covid stuff happened.

My dad introduced me to his girlfriend in December 2020 and they got married in May 2021. She has three kids. Her oldest is 10, her middle kid is 7 and her youngest is 5. The youngest is a boy and the other two are girls.

When we all moved in together me and her oldest got our own rooms and the younger two shared. A few months ago my dad and his wife were really annoyed because the 7 year old hates sharing with the 5 year old. They don't get along at all (neither do the girls) and the 7 year old doesn't like how clingy the 5 year old is, and he really is clingy. He gets nightmares and wants to share a bed and all kinds of stuff. But not with the adults. With his sister but he also asked me a few times. Because the girls don't get along and because the 10 year old is a girl who is at an age where sharing with a brother might be awkward, my dad told me he wanted me and his stepson to share and he laid out the expectation that I be there for my stepbrother for nightmares and stuff and to really invest in being a good brother because he's far more affectionate and longing for closeness that neither of his sisters give him. I told dad I wasn't okay with any of that and I didn't want to share a room with his stepson and be responsible for a closeness I don't want. He told me I had no choice and that I should want a closeness because we're family and I have the chance to have a brother. The rest of that week he was in my (former) room and he tried climbing into my bed every night and he would wake up once I went to bed (really light sleeper) and would chat my ear off.

Two years ago I was given the choice to stay at either parents house more permanently and with the changes at dads, I decided to stay with my mom and not go to my dad's for parenting time anymore. Dad didn't like it but he thought I'd come back around. I still haven't been there since. My dad's wife is furious because her son hates being on his own in the room all the time. She berated me real bad for that and mom told her to never contact me again when she heard it. My dad told me I need to stop acting like this and I came across and very entitled and selfish.

152,1dso13c,AITA for Pointing Out My Friend's Partner Invited a Stranger on Our Trip Without Consulting Us?,"My friend, Chris, has parents with work benefits that include making early and cheaper reservations at a holiday resort. About three years ago, Chris and his partner, Joan, suggested to our close friend group that we all go on a trip together. This group includes me, my partner, friend Keith (who's not really relevant here), friend Brian, and a few others. We all agreed on who would go, aiming to keep the participants within our close circle.

Things got complicated when Brian wanted to bring his girlfriend, with whom he has an on-again, off-again relationship. She's also not very well-liked among the group, but that's beside the point. The resort has a limit of six people, so if Brians's girlfriend came, they would need their own place nearby, freeing up a spot in our reserved accommodation.

I had a couple of potential candidates for this spot. One was Matt, who is more my friend but has been known to the group for years. Chris has even stayed at his house and had meals with his family. The other option was Frank, my best friend who used to be part of the close friend group but now lives in another city. I'm the only one who keeps in regular contact with him.

Respecting everyone's opinions, I suggested these two as potential candidates and waited for feedback. A few days ago, I asked Chris if he had discussed it with Joan. He said that Joan had already invited her colleague from work, someone only she knows and whom most of us have never met. I was confused because I thought we were inviting close friends to ensure everyone felt comfortable.

I told Chis that this wasn't what I had envisioned and it was disappointing that they made a decision without discussing it with the group. Joan got really mad, saying she doesn't need my permission and pointed out that she doesn't know Matt well either. I agreed but clarified that I had only suggested Matt and was waiting for the group's opinion before making any decisions. Joan also mentioned that I am not the one who is organizing the trip, which I understood as in my opinion matters less or simply doesn't matter at all.

I was in an important meeting when she took the test and she wasn‚Äôt expecting to get a positive, so she called her sister (23F) to talk with her and to calm her nerves. Soon after, I got out of my meeting and my wife had driven to my work to meet me. She told me the news and I was ecstatic.

She congratulated us on the pregnancy and then, in front of everyone, expressed surprise that SIL had found out before me. My wife was mortified and the whole room fell into awkward silence.

I talk down to him when he asks me anything. I don't act like this and never had before, like a total jerk, I hate it. I've talked to him a few times and offered to help with ordering and inventory just to be ignored and denied. He has made at least 5 huge mistakes in the 7 months he has been manager, 2 of which have been complete engine replacements 30k+ each time (VW and Audi).

I'm seriously done with him. He makes close to 1.5x more than I do. (I fell into a position when minimum wage was increased my wage increased with it but now starting wage for 1 of 5 positions is more than what I make. I have trained on all positions and can do everything we offer).

8am-7pm+, 5 days a week. My paycheck is close to $1,000.

Anyway, Am I the asshole for treating him like an idiot?

Here is just a few things I left out.

* Doesn't order on a weekly basis like every other manager in district does.
* We have to order from a separate business which leaves customers waiting 15+ minutes, when they wait 30 minutes to 1 hour just to be serviced.
* We can't order by ourselves which would save time. He has to check the entire shop after we do to make sure we don't have the item.
* Inventory is never correct because it isn't entered properly. (copy and paste from last inventory taken)
* In a high-turnaround job, we run 3-4 people on weekdays and 3 people on weekends. Understaffed and overworked. He leaves early most of the time.
* Our speed because of lack of supplies and tools are called out in front of customers.
* Micro-managing and changing the rules as he sees fit. I was tasked with the job of training the neww people that make more money than me.
* Taking shortcuts, not following protocol. (Using hammers on sparkplug sockets and drain plugs, damaging them further).
* Demeanor makes everyone feel uneasy. Instead of coaching he belittles and humiliates them.
* Doesn't hold people to the same standard. I was going to leave because of his attitude and lack of staffing, was immediately threatened with job abandonment and termination. Someone else does this and he says it's someone else's fault.
* I've been snitching hard on people. The same person that leaves early stays on his phone, doesn't perform quality checks, and ignores process.
* HR is a joke.
* District Manager consistently lies to customers. General Managers lie to him, he lies upwards. (I reported a manager for showing me a porn video he was already watching at the front counter.

* We have to order from a separate business which leaves customers waiting 15+ minutes, when they wait 30 minutes to 1 hour just to be serviced.
* We can't order by ourselves which would save time. He has to check the entire shop after we do to make sure we don't have the item.
* Inventory is never correct because it isn't entered properly. (copy and paste from last inventory taken)
* In a high-turnaround job, we run 3-4 people on weekdays and 3 people on weekends. Understaffed and overworked. He leaves early most of the time.
* Our speed because of lack of supplies and tools are called out in front of customers.
* Micro-managing and changing the rules as he sees fit. I was tasked with the job of training the neww people that make more money than me.
* Taking shortcuts, not following protocol. (Using hammers on sparkplug sockets and drain plugs, damaging them further).
* Demeanor makes everyone feel uneasy. Instead of coaching he belittles and humiliates them.
* Doesn't hold people to the same standard. I was going to leave because of his attitude and lack of staffing, was immediately threatened with job abandonment and termination. Someone else does this and he says it's someone else's fault.
* I've been snitching hard on people. The same person that leaves early stays on his phone, doesn't perform quality checks, and ignores process.
* HR is a joke.
* District Manager consistently lies to customers. General Managers lie to him, he lies upwards. (I reported a manager for showing me a porn video he was already watching at the front counter. Nothing happened.)",2.0,0.12399903684854507,0,0

I've started planning out the logistic on my end and have been talking to her and she's given her inputs on whether she likes them or not but nothing has set in stone.

Anyway, today I was planning arrivals logistic and I found the fastest way for us to get to Tokyo and a few closest hotels to the station (we're arriving at night). I showed this to my boyfriend and he narrowed it down to 1 hotel. I said we should book it bc it was cheap, had free cancelation up to the day of, and no charge upfront.

His reasoning is we should ask her first before booking bc otherwise it's rude and my reason is I'm okay whether they decide to stay at another hotel or not.

161,1dsmjdh,AITA for telling my mom that I think our dog needs put down because it's causing everyone stress?,"I (15 F) have a rocky relationship with my mom (52 F) and she tends to get upset at me for many things that I do, hence why I don't know if I'm really wrong this time. Our pitbull Frankie (14/15ish F) was adopted in 2015 and my mom has a special emotional connection with her. She picked her out from the shelter and I think she's one of my mom's only companions. Mom often tells me that Frankie is better behaved than me. 

Anyway, Frankie has lost usage in both of her hind legs due to arthritis and cannot control her bowels, so Mom puts her in diapers and Frankie lays in her dog bed all day, except for when she poops. She gets restless and drags her back legs behind her to find someone to change her diaper. She doesn't eat her kibble anymore, so Mom feeds her rice, beef, and broth. In the past couple of months, Frankie has dropped from ~70lbs to 45. You can see her ribs. Mom also loves to post on YouTube shorts and is adamant on earning some extra money from it. 

Last night, she made me record a video of her changing Frankie's diaper and Frankie looked so terrible. She looked like she wanted to end it all. Mom then went up to me and showed me the caption she wrote for the video and asked me if it was good. I told her that it might not be wise to post, since it's unnecessary and to many may just be sad to see. Mom told me that's nonsense and Frankie was just fine. She posted it and told me that maybe the money she makes off of YT will earn enough to pay the vet bills. 

My dad (52 M) agrees with me that we need to put Frankie to sleep, but he doesn't tell Mom anything to prevent her from blowing up at him. Mom makes him clean up Frankie's diapers when she's at work. We were having lunch today and something my mom said combined with something my dad didn't say led me to tell my mom that keeping Frankie alive is a lose-lose situation for everyone. They're both stressed out about her and my night-shift dad never gets any sleep during the day. Mom told me that I was being insensitive and that we can afford to keep Frankie alive, unlike ""some other people who just give up and kill their dogs."" 

Selfishly enough, part of me also wants her to be put down because my mom insists on taking Frankie to our vacation in August, which is a 6 hour drive and Frankie will be sitting (and pooping) in the seat next to me. So it makes me wonder if I'm really right about what I believe or if it's just because of some of my own desires. I also feel bad because I can be too blunt sometimes and maybe I was being too insensitive this time.

Its not in a loving way, its to annoy me. I know this for a fact. Even if people just simply sit too close to me i get overwhelmed. Or if my sister (F11) comes into my room and refuses to leave, i get angry and overwhelmed and end up yelling. I dont try to be mean, i just cant handle when people are in my space without my permission. I also cant handle when people talk with food in their mouth. My dad does this very often. I ask him to stop every time he does it, but he thinks it's funny, so he continues doing it on purpose. I truly do get angry and mean when people push my boundaries, which is why I'm here.

I already feel like a bad daughter because I want to go to my dads for a whole month so this is just the icing on the already burning cake of my mother and I‚Äôs relationship.

She refused. We drove to where we saw another one of my friends (one that also had no clue where the others were). I got out of the car and as soon as i walked up to my friend, i broke down. A few minutes of our parents talking, my friends mom told me to go over and thank my mom and tell her im walking with my friend and her mom to my other friends.

168,1dslo6k,AITA for texting my friend,"We have 3 people, me, Emma, and Max. We're all in high school but we met in grade 6, me and Max became friends before Emma. We had a bond like siblings, we would act like siblings and even trick people into thinking we were. We met Emma and she liked Max so she told me and I got them together.

Now in high school, I was talking to Max and standing close to him?? Emma texted me a paragraph explaining how she didn't like how touchy and how I was acting like a ""pick me"" towards her boyfriend. I told her I had no clue what she meant because I wasn't acting any different towards him. She kept finding reasons to be mad at me when I did nothing, for example, I was being rude to her, which she didn't explain how when I asked. She also previously was talking bad about me saying how I was flirting with Max and wanted to get with him, even though I hooked them up.

I gave her multiple reasons why I didn't like Max and how I wasn't being rude, but she got more mad and went as far as to say she didn't want to be friends with me anymore. She then went on to post videos about me, reposting things on social media (most were about girl best friend), spreading rumours, and talking bad about me to people she knew I didn't like. I confronted her over text saying what she was doing was petty and not necessary. Believe it or not, Max texted me and said he wanted me and Emma to be friends again so he had a conversation with her and convinced her to talk to me again.

We went back to normal for a tiny bit after Max stepped up and did something, but apparently, that wasn't good enough for her because she texted me yet another paragraph about how I was talking badly, making fun of her, laughing at jokes towards her, and being close with her boyfriend.

170,1dslcyq,AITA for ‚Äúimplying‚Äù that my sister is poor? ,"So for some backstory, my younger sister(F23) and I(F27), lost our mother when we were young and my father dealt with cancer for many years before he passed away in 2018. Because of my father‚Äôs situation and the fact that we had no other family members, I took on more of a parenting role for my sister and started working when I was 15 to help my dad with bills. I was fortunate enough to get a well paying job after attending a trade school and I am currently paying for my sister‚Äôs college tuition because I really value education and wanted my sister to be able to have options for her future but I try not to spoil her.   

Now last week my sister told me that she had found a part time job so that she could start helping me with her tuition payments, I told her she didn‚Äôt have to but she insisted. She then told me that it was an hour walk from her dorms. 

In the past she had talked about wanting to save up for a used car but it just kind of didn‚Äôt happen. I figured that a car could be useful for her with this job so I brought up the idea again and told her that I would be willing to co-sign on a loan for her. I said that I know it would probably take her a while to save up the money on her own so this was  after route. I trust her and have always raised her to be responsible with money and live up to her debts. She didn‚Äôt respond for a couple days which was weird as we usually text at least every other day so I texted her again a few days later asking if she was okay. She responded that I needed to stop treating her like she‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and that she was only getting the part time job to start paying me back so that I could stop ‚Äúholding her tuition over her head‚Äù. 

Let me just say that I have never implied that she needed to ever ‚Äúpay me back‚Äù nor have I ever ‚Äúheld it over her head‚Äù. The only expectations that I had for her when she started school was that she needed to be passing all of her classes and that she could never get arrested.

I responded to her because I figured that maybe she didn‚Äôt realize what co-signing for an auto loan entailed. So I let her know that SHE would be the one making all of the payments and I was really only there to give the bank a kind of vouch for her, especially since she‚Äôs still young. She once again didn‚Äôt reply to me. It has been a week and yesterday she sent me $1,000 through venmo.

She still isn‚Äôt replying to my texts and I‚Äôm just not sure if maybe i coddled her too much? 

PS I only gave her so much support because I wanted her to have the support that I couldn‚Äôt from an adult when I was just starting out in the world like her.

But if I do bad I'm ""just horrible"" and ""should never pick up a controller again"". And I just spent a week without technology and when I get back, my one friend (S) tells me that everyone was nonstop making fun of me and shit talking me on the game. I don't bring it up for a while until a few hours in. We've played a few customs and in one I did good (they just called it luck) and in another I did bad (they said ""that's the difference between luck and skill) so they start talking shit to me. It starts normal and then it gets personal so I fight back... Until, my one friend (D) says ""honestly guys this just killed my mood"" and everyone agreed.

174,1dsky0w,AITA for refusing to dogsit for my sister ,"



Me and my sister grew up with lots of pets ie cats and dogs. When I was younger I had this one dog who I loved more than anything unfortunately she went missing appropriately 5years into loving her, when she left I was deeply heartbroken and I felt so guilty for neglecting her. After that, my love for dogs significantly decreased and I hardly played with the dogs that were left. My mom and I moved elsewhere in 2018 where I could only have a cat.

Until this year, I've only learned to care about cats even though my dad still had dogs. This week my sister brought home a puppy she said she couldn't go back to her place with, so she wants me to take care of him. The only problem is I'm not a big fan of dogs anymore and this puppy is super hostile me to  and nobody else at home . 

When I tell her that I don't think I can manage everyone claims to put up with my cat yet my cat is just chill and causes absolutely no issues in the house. The dog on the other hand, is so hostile to me and my cat, he makes it very difficult to even get out of the house

I'm getting desperate for him like me now an example is how I heard that if you feed a dog meat with your spit on it, then it will ditch it's hostility towards you, I did that and it didn't work. This is bad because when my sister goes back, my mom and grandma won't bother to feed him or anything at best they'll leave him to eat with the chickens, and I'll be the only one who cares enough about animals to look after him properly

all texting was done on fb

Carly invites me to join Patty for lunch at 12pm meeting at the restaurant. We're coworkers but I'm not close to Patty, so I wasn't in contact with her. It was my first time hanging out with Patty. I showed up on time to the restaurant, Carly was late, she told Patty. No signs of Patty. Carly 10 mins late and we find out the restaurant is closing in an hour, Carly texted Patty but no response. We wait another 5 mins not sure if Patty was coming. We get seated and tell the waitress for 3 ppl but only gives us a table with 2, we thought she would move us to a bigger table later. Carly sends Patty a iMessage bc she wasnt responding, that we are seated in the restaurant & let her know when nearby. Patty replies Carly 10 mins later asking where she was and that shes at the train station. Carly said we ordered already as waitress was rushing and asks if she wants us to order for her bc restaurant is closing soon. Patty replies 10 mins later says its so far away. Her unresponsiveness made us feel she wasn't interested in coming anymore. Food arrived 8 mins later, Patty arrives 2 mins later, 45 mins late& didnt apologize. We ask waitress to move tables but said they can‚Äôt do that. They tell Patty she has 3 mins to order she says she‚Äôll eat at another nearby restaurant, we persuade her to not but she leaves. We finish eating and ask where she is, she said she went home. 

Next day Patty unfriends us, Carly asks what happened. Patty said she waiting for us at the train station, we didnt show up on time (she wanted to meet at 11:30am and walk to the restaurant which wasnt mentioned), and decided to stay there since Carly was gonna be late but already knew i was at the restaurant. Contradicts her statement saying she knows we're meeting at the restaurant at 12 but stayed back bc she wanted to sit. Said ‚ÄúI told you i was at the train station and it clearly explains that i‚Äôm 10 mins away from the restaurant but you guys proceed to eat without me. Shouldn‚Äôt it be common sense that the train station was nearby so it means i‚Äôm near the restaurant too. you lack manners and i felt disrespected‚Äù, it took her 20 mins to arrive which wasn't near. She was mad about us not saving her a seat and not waiting for her to eat at another restaurant instead because she was showing up late (never said she was going to be late, just no response).  She also claimed she was unresponsive to messages because her phone wasn't working properly, which we felt sounded like an excuse as all her replies were just an ""okay"" that took 10 mins for each message. We felt disrespected as well as we felt it sounded like she was finding an excuse to not show up anymore. 

Then says things like ""you win, please dont text me"" ""liar"", and said Carly wasn't being sorry when she apologized several times in their conversation while she didn't bother to apologize for being late or tried to explain why.

At this point I already found a place to stand and other people were closer to the entrance.

But she was not polite, she was very self important and rude in the way she talked with others. She expected a bunch of strangers to not only notice her situation immediately, she also expected everyone involved to understand that she is not capable of carrying her stuff while traveling alone.

They moved into my 2 bedroom flat with me about a 2years ago . Adam had talked to Josh to make sure was ok with it. Josh and I get on well and always had. 


Problems started between Adam and Josh once Josh turned 16. Typical teenager stuff like coming home late, having an attitude when he was asked to help out‚Ä¶etc. They would argue to the point where Josh would leave and stay with his mom (she hasn‚Äôt really been able to control him as he‚Äôs gotten older); he would run away when Adam would try to set boundaries or ground him. In total, Josh has lived with me and Adam for roughly 7-8 months on and off. He seemed set on staying with his mom since last he‚Äôd ‚Äúrun away‚Äù and so we had been using my spare room (Josh‚Äôs old room) for my make up studio and storage.

Over the weekend, Adam went to his mom‚Äôs house for her bday and texted me saying and Josh showed up. He asked if he could stay over for the night because it was already late and we live close by. I said ok and I had the couch set up.


When they got home, Josh asked me if it would be okay if he stayed the weekend. I said it was fine since Adam was happy to finally reconnect with him for so long.

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole, I asked Alex if he had talked to Josh about how long he would stay and he said yes, the weekend‚Ä¶he‚Äôs going back to him moms tomorrow. I replied, then why is he rearranging everything in that room? He doesn‚Äôt have to move everything if I‚Äôm just gonna rearrange it all back again tomorrow. 

Adam mumbled something about talking to him but hasn‚Äôt really said much since.
Am I the asshole for not wanting him to move back in? 

Edit: 
We are not American, if you leave home at 16 by law they cannot make you come home if you‚Äôre staying with another guardian.

The day of finally comes and I was so excited to go, she was the one picking me up as she did offer. In order to get to the lake, one must go up the same route for about an hour. However, about 10 minutes after the drive started she made a wrong turn, I pointed this out to her because I knew she knew how to get there (we had gone together before) She told me she knew and we were just going to pick up her other friend. 

I got a little irritated since I wasn‚Äôt previously aware of this but I rubbed it off for the time being. As we arrived to the friends house I realized who it was. This guy (20m) continuously bullied me when i was a freshman and he was a junior in high school. He was also just rude and he definitely isn‚Äôt my favorite person. My friend knew this too because I have told her about why I don‚Äôt like him. 

I reminded her of this when we got there and she just brushed it off and acted as if I never told her anything about him. This was super annoying to me because I know I did multiple times. I told her I wasn‚Äôt going to go to the beach with him and asked her if she could take me home. She said it wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to spend a couple hours with him and that I could still enjoy myself. 

I persisted till she finally took me home, I haven‚Äôt heard from her since, i‚Äôm thinking of apologizing but I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm in the wrong. AITA?",0.0,0.043867841362953186,0,1
182,1dsk0ey,AITA for annoying my coworker who complained to me?,"This happened yesterday and it's been bugging me since then.

I (20F) was at work on my break. My younger coworker (16/17F) sat down next to me, she seemed flustered because one of our supervisor had just gotten upset over something other employees had done. I am not someone who gets bothered by that kind of thing, so I just offered her some reassurance of ""we're fine, don't worry about it"" which she seemed okay with.

She then went, ""my stomach hurts."" This is where I worry that I may be the AH: I went ""oh, did you eat?"". When she responded yes, I followed up with, ""ah, do you need some water?"" She then went, ""no, I just need my stomach to stop hurting,"" before leaving to take her break somewhere else.
 
I have a history of being overly solutions-oriented. I can also be overly concerned for other people. I know that both of these characteristics came out in that interaction. I worry that I was being  annoying in that moment, to the point where I was the AH. Sometimes people just want to complain, which I totally understand, but I often forget that in the moment. I worry that this may have been one of those times.

For some more context, we are fairly new co-workers, just since the last couple of months. We have had a couple small-talk interactions before this. She is nice but I do not think that we would be friends outside of work. 

I also acknowledge that I am overthinking this. I think that my getting some opinions on this interaction would help give me some clarity about whether I was truly be annoying, or if it was more a situation where she was acting like a teenager (which I can't fault her for, I was there not too long ago obviously lol)",Not the A-hole,2024-07-01,"AITA for annoying my coworker who complained to me?

Around a year or so ago, i heard about a deployment from my superiors that greatly interested me, and so i said i was interested to learn more info before i made any final decisions. I had mentioned it to my gf and she didn‚Äôt seem too bothered at the time because no decisions were made. A few months went by and i found out i got placed on the deployment before she and i could really talk about me deploying. Obviously, she was very upset by this information, but I really wasn‚Äôt. I had joined the military to actually do something and I am happy i got placed on the deployment. Obviously i‚Äôm not ecstatic about leaving her for a year, but I was willing to accept that to accomplish one of my military  goals that she had known about since we had started dating. 
Throughout this process, she has told me all
about how she doesn‚Äôt want me to go and I had responded by saying that I had no choice, but i kind of did. I could have backed out of the deployment and they could have replaced me, but I wanted to accomplish my goal.

185,1dsjg4o,AITA for introducing drugs,"I have a family member (27M currently) who has always suffered from severe anxiety. This family member avoided recreational drugs due to their anxiety. They were a straight-A student and extremely driven. Around November 2018 they experienced bad anxiety accompanied by panic attacks. At the time they were taking antidepressants to manage their anxiety. During this time they also tried Valium to help with their anxiety. At one point in November 2018 they drove to the hospital at 1am in the morning to ask the nurses for Valium to help with their anxiety. Around this time they also fell sick and were prescribed corticosteroids. Due to the corticosteroids they ate uncontrollably and gained 5kg in one week. They also indicated to me that they felt like resorting to meds to put themselves at ease (anxiety, strained relationships etc.). This all happened in November 2018 and they told me about it.

A few weeks later in December 2018 I thought it would be a good idea to introduce this person to weed because they trusted me. They ended up getting high from one puff of a joint and seemed to enjoy it despite being reluctant to smoke in the first place. A few days later they came to me really scared saying they had a terrible experience on weed (severe anxiety/paranoia etc.) and never wanted to do it again because they never wanted to feel that way again. I got angry at them because I wanted to buy weed to make edibles to take at a concert. They tried to talk me out of it and said that taking edibles at a concert was a bad idea and I'd likely have a bad experience because of the environment. I didn't listen and didn't care about about their terrible experience. I pressured them to drive me to the dealer's house and we bought the weed. I made the edibles and gave them to my family member to hang onto until my concert. I took them at the concert and ended up having a really bad anxiety/panic attack during which I sent distressed messages to my family member asking them to pick me up or send someone else if they were unable to.

It turns out that my family member finished the remaining edibles and ended up smoking weed frequently for the next year. By December 2019 the weed had taken a massive toll on them and they began to show signs of mental health issues. They continued smoking weed until halfway through 2021 when they finally stopped. Unfortunately they now have really poor mental health including a severe worsening of the anxiety they already had.

From the neighbors that have came up to me, everyone has been very friendly and welcoming which I really appreciate since I'm not from around the town.

I have noticed that some neighbors have been having frequent parties the last couple of weeks but I chalked it up to it being celebrations since I know one neighbor's daughter just graduated highschool, and July 4th is coming up. I have been to some of these parties to get to know the other neighbors better and one person who really stands out to me is this one neighbor, Melinda. (Not her actual name) 
At a neighbors party she came up to me and introduced herself and we talked for a while. This is when I learned about the ""Newest Neighbor Party"". Apparently, the newest neighbor is supposed to throw a grand party showing off their home and entertain the neighborhood as a whole thing. Melinda told me since I was the newest neighbor, it was my duty to.  thought Melinda was joking when she told me this as it didn't make sense to me and I laughed. This seemed to have had made Melinda a little angry, as she said she was serious and it was a tradition in the neighborhood and that I had 2 weeks to host a party. 

This was 2 weeks ago. Yesterday was the day I was supposed to do this ""tradition"" but I happily stayed in bed. Melinda and a couple neighbors came and rang on the doorbell but I ignored them and enjoyed binge watching childhood shows. I decided to go outside today and Melinda came up to me furious, saying that I didn't do the tradition and that I was being a bad neighbor. 

The thing is however, I asked some other people about this ""tradition"" and they have heard some people do it, but mostly never really mentioned it to be a reaccuring thing that each new person in the neighborhood should do. I told Melinda that I wouldn't be throwing a party anytime soon as I didn't feel comfortable with the thought of people coming into my home let alone me having to entertain them. 
Melinda got angry, saying that the neighborhood is like a ""big family"" and stormed off. I let it go, but the neighbors that were with Melinda at my house that night have been telling me I should've just did the party and that I'm leaving a bad impression. 

I think my reason is justified, but I'm not really sure. So AITA? 

Thank you for all the comments and suggestions. 
I also see where I could've told Melinda that I wasn't comfortable, but from the one to two interactions I've had with her, it sounds like she wouldn't have cared regardless, but I don't want to assume. 
A lot of suggestions  were very insightful and funny. 
After I posted this I went to sleep, and decided to go out today. I didn't bump into Melinda or any of her friends, so I'm not sure about her. However some neighbors have offered to help me continue to move in by bringing boxes in. 
One of these neighbors, John (not real name) has been living here for a while, and he told me he's not fond of Melinda and from what he has seen, some neighbors just try to avoid her or put up with her for the sake of it.

The deal was that he‚Äôd do maintenance jobs around the place that i couldn‚Äôt do as I need a knee replacement so have mobility issues 
The problem is he tells me the jobs he‚Äôs got lined up for his days off but he rarely achieves half of them. Some jobs he does I don‚Äôt need doing. So I get disappointed and we argue. He says I only keep him around as a slave which is pretty offer. I have suggested he pay me $50 a week instead but he‚Äôs refused. At first it was great as he‚Äôd do a heap of things for me and I was v grateful. 
Q1 am I being unfair and asking too much? 
Q2 what would be fair? 
I feel like I‚Äôm being used as a cheap place to live. He feels used as cheap labour.

191,1dsikeo,WIBTA For Changing My Name?,"(My family's from southern United States, but I myself was raised in Australia, so please excuse my spelling that may alternate between American and Australian English)

I was named after my great grandmother (I will be refering to her as Ma), who was living at the time of my birth but is now deceased. It's a name that was quite highly popular in the deep south USA (where my whole family lives) at the time of Ma's birth, but now is more seen as a unique or ""old-timey"" name, though younger people with the name exist. My mother (the parent related to Ma) loved Ma and her name, and named me in her honour.

With both my parents having been born and raised in the deep south, my brother and I were raised as Christians (in the Southern way you might expect), and though I myself have become more atheist as I grew past the age where kids rely on their parents for what they believe, and additionally turned out to be LGBTQ+ (in the deep south, hurray /s), I still hold some traditionally Southern values. Basically just the respecting family stuff, but that part of my background is relevant to this, I feel.

While Ma's name is a perfectly respectable name, I've never felt it fit me. It always felt strange when people used it in reference to me in a way, and even before questioning my identity had my friends call me various nicknames. It doesn't really feel like mine, since it was Ma's first and given to me *because* she had it first, and I am nothing like her (no disrespect to her; she was a great woman) Having settled on the name I want to be known as, legally changing my name has come to mind.

This isn't the right subreddit for legal stuff so I'll skip over that, of course. The main problem that caused me to write this post is, as you may have guessed from my perhaps too long explanation above, is my family. As I said, my mother loves my legal name (as does my father, but this is mum's grandmother so I'm more focused on her here), and as I've asked hypotheticals about name changes, I know she'd be upset if I changed my name. So would the rest of my family. It kind of feels like I'd be disappointing my mother and everyone else if I do so, like I'm abandoning them in a way by changing my name from one of our family to one nobody in our family has gone by. Additionally, I feel like I'm disrespecting Ma by changing my name from hers. Since she died when I was too young to remember her, I don't really have a strong emotional connection to her, but she's still family.

So, would I be the asshole?

Ugh, sorry if this is an annoying question or it seems like I should instantly know the answer or something. Please understand how where my family comes from would at least complicate my feelings on this. I just need some outside opinions, I guess.

I've been deciding my after birth plans since I was 16 weeks. My partner and I decided early on that ideally we would like to have 5 to 7 days to ourselves so we can spend time bonding, working out breastfeeding, and generally having time as a family of 3. 

Now I am 34 weeks nearly 35, family especially parents have started to really push back on the idea. Telling us we are being cruel, denying them access to their grandchild, not letting them have the same experiences as their friends.They said they only want 30minutes with us during the first 48 to 72 hours so they can check in that I'm okay and to see the baby. 

I said if I'm not okay or birth was traumatic then the plan would change and they can come round as extra support but if the birth goes well then I would like to wait 5 days.

They said I'm being unreasonable.

My parents are wonderful, not horrible parents who need strict boundaries and I do understand where they are coming from. But it feels like they aren't really understanding my point of view. Now I'm questioning whether I'm making the right choice, and whether it's going to cause a big division that can't be healed.

My dad even had to reassure her that the woman was only a friend and she has kids and she‚Äôs married already and we‚Äôre just gonna be there for the weekend.

Skipping on to Daytona we‚Äôve hanged out with our friends for the weekend and when it came to heading off back home a conversation about our mother started.

I told him that she‚Äôs pretty much occupied all day at work depending on how many clients she would have for the day and comes home pretty exhausted.

 For a couple years now I (18M) was apart of a children arts groups student council. A major part of membership is volunteering at events selling soda to help raise funds. The biggest event we do each year is our city's Fourth of July event. My family and I have been pretty consistently volunteering at this event each year we have been required to. This year marked my last year on the board due to me aging out and, perhaps in some cruel trick, this year was the most hectic. 
Due to me not wanting to do the event because of this being my afformentioned last year, I did not sign up until much later when the only time left was til ten p.m. and the the remained slots split my family up. When we got there we had to wait several minutes to get a card reader working due to the orginazations leader not having enough trust to just send a log in. Not that big a deal as this was expected. What made me angry was that we were told that after nine we could not open any more product. This included water. Of course right after 9, due to it being a southern summer day, everyone wanted water. This lead to me being overwhelmed and a bit agro. I didn't let it effect my interactions, for the most part. 
A customer comes, he's paying with cash so it takes a bit for change. I'm making small talk. He asks about where the fireworks are set off at. One of the big draws of the event is the fireworks.

Hello, I 17, communicated to my bestfriend that what she had said to me made me feel as though I was rude and actively hurting her. 

So to start this off I had an idea for like a book and one of the characters were inspired off of her, and she has like a heart uterus if anyone knows what that means, if not i would search it up because idk how to go into deep about it and I don't think I'm  the person to explain that, anyways.

In the future it may cause some issues with having kids so I asked her if she would be ok if I made an idea where her close friend in the book would carry her child because like something happened and she was having a hard time,

To me at that moment I didn't think it was rude to say that or even bring it up, I wasn't actively trying to hurt her (just wanted to mention before anyone jumps right to the comments her being upset it's 100% valid I do understand now) and I didn't see much wrong with it because all I thought was that it was heart warming and sweet.

This is where my issue came in though, immediately after I asked this, instead of talking to me about how it hurt her she hid it from me and kinda hinted at being upset without being super direct like: making me feel like a shitty person for saying something but if I asked if I said something wrong she would deny it so I would be stuck in this cycle of feeling shitty but having no communication as to what I did <- so ya thats the best way to explain it if anyone understands, 

But something about me, and her ig she gets mad a lot but sometimes when she acts like this she's not actually mad so I cant understand if she's actually upset so to me i can't see if she's mad or not so I decided to mention that she could've just said no (and explain how she made me feel) and that's when a fight kinda started.


In the end she told me she was gonna go (ignore me for who knows how long) and I decided to summarize that i understood what she meant but could've just said that because since she didn't it caused more harm and if we hadn't had this fight then I would still be clueless as to what I did and she's still ignoring me.

200,1dshgki,AITAH for not properly comforting my friend during his loss?,"I had invited my closest friends out to dinner for my 18th birthday and sent the invitations and set the date a month in advance so that everyone would be able to come. Unfortunately one of my best friends 18M texted me the morning of telling me that he wouldn't be able to attend as his uncle had passed away.

I obviously understood and replied saying ""may he rest in peace"" I then followed up asking if it was from his mothers side (he told us that his family doesn't get along with their dads side of the family and they are hostile towards his mother) to which he replied telling me it was his dads side, I then asked if they were close to which I got zero response. I later asked him if he was okay and he said he was fine. 

After the dinner everyone sent pictures in the group chat and those who weren't able to attend complimented us and said they hoped we had fun, however my friend proceeded to leave the groupchat. Me and my other friend 16F texted him asking if he was all good to which he replied yes. i then told him if something was up to lmk. 

A few hours later I asked again if he was all good to which he replied saying ""now you guys careüíÄ"" And proceeded to tell me that I should have comforted him and been there for him and told him that I was here for him ect. I asked him why he didnt tell me before that I was being insensitive and he told me that he shouldn't have had to bring it up because it shows how much I really care.

For some background info, we have been best friends for almost a year and in this friendship I have been there for him at his lowest points, often sleeping on call or letting him cry in my arms at a point. I introduced him to 7 of my closest friends and they all comforted him and were there for him when he had issues in his toxic relationship, my friends would give him rides hang out w him offer moral support ect. 

He left every groupchat with the people I introduced him to. I confronted him and told him that if he was upset he should have texted me instead of letting resentment grow. heres where im prob TA, I told him im not his girlfriend and I shouldn't have to read his mind to figure out that hes lying when hes saying hes okay. I told him he should have straight up told me that he was hurt by the loss or by my lack of sensitivity. he then told me to ""honestly fuck off"" and i have not replied since.

201,1dsh1j1,AITA for making a joke I perceived as harmless?,"My sister (29) and I (25F) have a complicated relationship. Basically anytime I say anything or make a comment or joke about something, she gets offended and shuts down and ignores me. This happens pretty much every time we are together. 

My whole life I have tried to make things light and be the jokester, but for some reason she takes every single thing I say personally and then ruins the mood for everyone and I always end up apologizing. Well today we were having a good time, no fights for about 4 hours. During this time she watched a couple of videos with her volume all the way up. I‚Äôm really sensitive to sound and I ask people to turn things down a lot. Anyway, I hadn‚Äôt said anything the first 5 times this happened even though it was really bothering me. So we are in the car and she starts watching this video, volume all the way up, and it‚Äôs going on for about a minute. 

Now, when I watch a video around other people, I immediately turn the volume almost completely off. She didn‚Äôt attempt to turn it down even a little. So I‚Äôm waiting for it to be over but it was just so annoying so I‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúhow do I tell her to turn it down without her getting mad at me?‚Äù I thought maybe a joke would work‚Ä¶it never does, but maybe this time it will (spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt). I end up saying, ‚ÄúYou know those buttons on the side of your phone control the volume‚Äù in a tone of voice that I perceived as light-hearted. Well, she immediately mutes the video and goes quiet. We get to the house and she says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna go home‚Äù in an annoyed and irritated voice. 

So I‚Äôm bothered now and she wants me to apologize but I just want to know if what I said really warranted that kind of response. AITA?

Also I did apologize and say ‚Äúwe all know I‚Äôm an asshole,‚Äù because that‚Äôs what I usually do, but I‚Äôm just tired of having to overthink everything I say. 

Edit: I acknowledge I was being passive aggressive and I should have just asked her directly. I will work on this. Please try and be kind, I‚Äôm weak and I‚Äôve already cried because I feel bad. Obviously Reddit is not for me‚Ä¶ 

Quick update: I apologized and was direct about the issue. Our mom made us hug. Thank you for the honesty and for those who were kind about it. 

This was my first post and I will not be posting another. I can‚Äôt handle Reddit apparently lol
