0,1dsuyz3,AITA for changing in the same bathroom as my bestie?,"For context, i am transgender (ftm) and have not medicaly transiond yet. I am still in school and i am not aloud to use any other bathroom than the girls bathroom. And my friend is bisexual and has a boyfriend. 

Me and my friend have weilding as an elective. There for, we have to change into weilding close everyday.
The shop has a single stalled restroom so to save time all the girls (and me cus i cant use the boys room.) change together in the one restroom. And so far my friends boyfried has not bat an eye at that once. 

But one day we were all running late and had no time to change back, me and my friend had the same class nect period and asked if the teacher if we could go change in the restrooms real quick and he was cool with it. These restrooms were the regualr restrooms with mutiliple stalls so we vhanged in different stalls.

When we got back my frieds boyfriend was mad at us. We asked why and he just said it was ""weird"" we told him that we litterally change together, infront of each other, everday. And asked why this time was different? He ended up just getting his friends to agree with him sayimg its wierd to change in a bathroom? Idk. He then brought up times that we acted ""gay"" with each other but we mentiond that he does the same shit too. *cough cough.. hyprocacy.* He couldnt really explain why he was mad, just that he didnt like her changing with me and calling us wierd.

1,1dsnuw1,AITA for fighting for my son to have my last name instead of his mom and her husband's?,"I (24m) have a 5 month old son with my ex (28f) and things are complicated af with her. We dated for 8 months. She left me for her ex and didn't tell me she was pregnant. It was her sister who told me and she told me the baby was mine and my ex knew about it. I reached out and told her I wanted to be a parent to my kid. She retaliated by marrying her ex and they told me *he* was going to be the father. I told them I would file with the courts when the baby was born to establish DNA and custody. My son was born, they did everything to keep me away including adding her husband to the birth certificate and giving the kid his last name, which at the time of his birth was just the husband's name, my ex changed hers last month before our court date. They also tried to make my son a junior for the husband (first and middle name) but something changed so his name is another form of her husband's name.

DNA proved I was the father. The judge ordered us to attend two mediation and therapy sessions together (me and my ex). We didn't reach an agreement because she was clear she wanted me out of the picture and wanted her husband to raise my son as his own. The judge did not take kindly to that. In my petition to the courts I said I wanted my son to have my last name, not his stepfather's.

The outcome from court was 50/50 physical and legal custody. My son's last name was changed (as was his first name because my ex's husband was bitter he didn't get his junior in my son). We are to communicate through an app about our son and nothing else. Neither of us pays child support. We both have to make decisions for him. I'm also on the birth certificate now.

My ex hates me for all that I did but the sorest point seems to be the last name. Her mom called me and I only met her twice while I was with my ex. But she called me and told me I was a petty little kid who was playing daddy when her grandson deserved a real man for a father and he had/has one in the husband and I should have left them to raise him together so he could have the stability of one home. She told me to deny ""that wonderful man"" the right to pass his name onto a child he swore to love as his own is awful and that my ex as the mom should share a name with her child. Then I had one of my ex's friends come up to me while I was out getting groceries and she called me petty for fighting for my son's last name. My ex also brought it up during our last exchange. She told me she hoped I was damn proud of myself for fighting over the name when she had her husband's name too and she wanted it to be their family name and I denied their son that (she said their son).

2,1dskwmk,AITA for leaving my brother out of social situations?,"Title, but here‚Äôs some context:
- I am 22f living at home for the summer (I go to uni in the winter months to a city 2h away)

-my brother 20m has been living at home and tried uni but had difficulty with it being online. He has struggled socially since COVID and is likely on the spectrum. 

- I am queer, not closeted when I am at uni during the winter among friends and others, but closeted during the summer months as my parents and community are homophobic and hostile. My parents, while liberal, are very homophobic and I fear they have ‚Äúsuspected something‚Äù about me as I have not expressed interest in dating men (or anyone for that matter) 

- Most of my friends are queer. I have two ‚Äúfriend groups‚Äù: one of friends that originated from my hometown, and one of friends I made at uni. The hometown friends are more empathetic to my situation (they have known me and my brother for years and understand that he is likely on the spectrum), and my uni friends do their best to be understanding. 

-my brother has historically ‚Äúsnitched‚Äù on me for various things and tends to side with my parents/show no opinion at all/be fully neutral on things such as homophobia, behaviours like smoking and drinking, and general behavior that would be deemed immoral (swearing, sex outside of marriage, etc.)

Because of these reasons, I have been VERY apprehensive about introducing my friends- especially uni friends- to my parents and brother. I fear that the presence of my visibly trans and queer friends would mark me as ‚Äúguilty‚Äù in my parents eyes, and I would lose them.
 (Context: when I was in high school some friends and I snuck out to a local Pride parade. We were found out, and the discussion with my parents essentially boiled down to ‚Äúif you are like that, you are not welcome in this house‚Äù. Because of this, I am deeply afraid of being outed to them) 

Recently, I have been making the two hour drive to see my uni friends. I try to make these trips short and uneventful, not colliding with any family events I am going to. My mom has seemingly started to realize that I am working to keep my friends and family separate, and wants me to bring my brother along to these hang outs.
 The thing is, some of the time I would be with friends that would actually try to ‚Äúpass‚Äù as straight and cis- but I still don‚Äôt really want my brother there. I love my brother deeply- but attempts at this previously have resulted in misgendering of my friend and him describing to our mom how my friends dress in clothing that does not adhere to their gender presentation as he saw it. 

Whenever my mom asks if my brother can come along, I quickly change the subject or don‚Äôt give her an answer.  I feel horrible doing that to my brother, and she does not let me forget it. AITA?

This was agreed on the day before we went. When we got to the restaurant it said that today they only accepted cash due to the card reader being broken so the only person who had cash on them agreed to pay and us send them money. Since I only had Zelle, my friend K told me I could just send the money to her and she'd send it to the person paying with cash. The entire day I was apologizing about slowing everyone down because I felt bad but they knew what they agreed to and all that was communicated back to me was ""it's okay, don't worry"". Apparently things were not ok because when I got home l saw this message: ""the way you were acting today was super inconsiderate of everyone around you and i just had to let you know...making us walk to somewhere completely out of the way because you can only eat kosher...so bring food with u like??? and then having my friends pay for your food was just downright disrespectful and ON TOP of all that we had to walk slower to make sure that you weren't left behind which honestly should not be our responsibility if you can't handle standing or walking for long periods of time you shouldn't go to events like this ""

6,1dsgse7,AITA for wanting my son's girlfriend to leave?,"Last September, my then 18 year old son asked if he could move his 17 year old girlfriend in because she came from a harsh and abusive home. I was hesitant and really didn't want to take on caring for another person. My husband and I were looking forward to finally having time to ourselves since we have raised three children. I gave in and felt bad for her. The mother didn't care if she left and so the journey of getting her to finish school and be financially responsible for her care, clothes, food, etc. began.  The problem I have is, I have told her how beautiful and intelligent she is to get her to feel more confident about herself. She hardly engages with any other members of our family except my son. She doesn't talk, doesn't like to leave her room, sleeps all the time, eats whatever and barely cleans up after herself. I've noticed that my son is constantly taking care of her and cleaning up after her. Ive tried having conversations with her about expectations but nothing works. She is now retreating to her room when my husband and I walk in the door. Zero conversation! She will be 18 in a few weeks and she's expected to get a job and start college. That's the rules for staying with us but I'm seeing no indication of her trying to get a job. Any communication from her goes through my son and then he tells me. I feel like I'm a stranger in my own home and I have to tiptoe around her feelings. Not sure what else I can do. 
So AITA for giving her one month to get a job or face moving out and also making my son angry with me?

Also, most of the stories of abuse turned out to be false. Yes, her mother sucks but I was told some pretty horrific things which were proven otherwise.

Throw away account. 5 years ago my ex and I split up. She has a son from a previous relationship, and he was roughly 9 months old when we met. We dated for quite some time, had a daughter, she cheated and we split. We decided custody out of court at the time would be one week with me, one week with her. However, she told me I couldn‚Äôt have my daughter if I didn‚Äôt also take her son and raise him (bio dad isn‚Äôt in the picture). Like a fool I agreed out of fear of her taking my daughter away, as women are automatically custodial parent where I live. So I raise him for the most part, never really bonding as father and son. Fast forward a couple of years, she gets married, her husband adopts her son. She continues to expect me to care for him with my daughter. Recently she tries to take my daughter from me, and I had enough. I called an attorney and got everything ready to fight for set custody that can‚Äôt be taken on a whim. I can tell her son doesn‚Äôt want to be here, I‚Äôve asked her several times to sit him down and ask what it is that he wants, but she tells me I should be fighting for him, that I‚Äôm less of a man for even asking her that. I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve spent so much time and money on a child that isn‚Äôt mine that has zero bond with me. After all this custody stuff dies down I‚Äôm completely done with him. I feel as though I shouldn‚Äôt have done it from the beginning, but especially after her husband adopted him. I feel like that should have been his responsibility from that point on. She‚Äôs constantly worried about messing him up mentally, but refuses to look at the situation and see that it‚Äôs not healthy, and tries to blame me for everything that goes wrong. I just want my daughter so I can put all of my effort into her and raise her to be the best person I possible can.

AITA for not wanting to take care of my exes son anymore?

Throw away account. 5 years ago my ex and I split up. She has a son from a previous relationship, and he was roughly 9 months old when we met. We dated for quite some time, had a daughter, she cheated and we split. We decided custody out of court at the time would be one week with me, one week with her. However, she told me I couldn‚Äôt have my daughter if I didn‚Äôt also take her son and raise him (bio dad isn‚Äôt in the picture). Like a fool I agreed out of fear of her taking my daughter away, as women are automatically custodial parent where I live. So I raise him for the most part, never really bonding as father and son. Fast forward a couple of years, she gets married, her husband adopts her son. She continues to expect me to care for him with my daughter. Recently she tries to take my daughter from me, and I had enough. I called an attorney and got everything ready to fight for set custody that can‚Äôt be taken on a whim. I can tell her son doesn‚Äôt want to be here, I‚Äôve asked her several times to sit him down and ask what it is that he wants, but she tells me I should be fighting for him, that I‚Äôm less of a man for even asking her that. I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve spent so much time and money on a child that isn‚Äôt mine that has zero bond with me. After all this custody stuff dies down I‚Äôm completely done with him. I feel as though I shouldn‚Äôt have done it from the beginning, but especially after her husband adopted him. I feel like that should have been his responsibility from that point on. She‚Äôs constantly worried about messing him up mentally, but refuses to look at the situation and see that it‚Äôs not healthy, and tries to blame me for everything that goes wrong. I just want my daughter so I can put all of my effort into her and raise her to be the best person I possible can.

8,1dsgik8,AITA for not telling my gf everything about my other IG account?,"My gf recently checked-out my other Instagram account and found a bunch of accounts it follows which she considers questionable. 

This IG account is one I use for research, special interests, and commenting on things I don‚Äôt want associated with my personal account. My personal account is private and only has (and follows) around 200 people. 

The account in question follows around 1,600 but has close to 25,000 followers. Indeed, the initial purpose of this IG account was to research engagement and retention and how to properly monetize IG. Over the years, it‚Äôs shifted focus and I use it mostly to follow people and companies engaged in things that interest me, and to post comments, mostly political, that I wouldn‚Äôt want to be associated personally with.  

As it happens, this account follows a bunch of beautiful women/models (maybe 100 out of 1,600)‚Ä¶ initially, because the strategy of engagement and retention called for it.  One is actually fully AI. Another is a woman dating a friend. Some I flippantly add and don‚Äôt remember why. Something, when suggested, piqued my interest. 

I have never communicated with any of them. Not a word. Nor would I. And once I‚Äôve found what I want (if there was something worth finding), I typically forget about these accounts. 

She‚Äôs upset I‚Äôm following some bikini model. My reply is I‚Äôm following an account that generates impressive AI content, and that aspect of it intrigues me. I follow a lot of male-generated AI content too, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. None of the other accounts matter. Tech, AI, political‚Ä¶ irrelevant. But the ones that happen to be beautiful women; problem.

She feels I‚Äôve been shady and hiding things. This account has always been public. Anyone can see everyone it follows. But, she doesn‚Äôt check it too often and only accidentally stumbled upon a mutual friend that both she and this account follow, and that set her off looking at who else is being followed. 

I haven‚Äôt been trying to hide anything intentionally. There‚Äôs nothing to hide. But still, she‚Äôs upset and feels I should‚Äôve mentioned it.  

I‚Äôve never felt the need to mention it because it‚Äôs insignificant and irrelevant. Obviously, if I were communicating with any of them, that‚Äôd be a huge issue. 

I‚Äôve obviously also offered to just unfollow those accounts and/or just shut down the whole account, but apparently that doesn‚Äôt address any part of the issue. The damage is done. 

I‚Äôm not sure how relevant this is, but I‚Äôll mention that she has been cheated on a lot. Like basically, every relationship she‚Äôs ever been in. I, on the other hand, know me and my intentions and have zero intentions of cheating on her.

So‚Ä¶ AITA? If so, what did I do and what should‚Äôve I done differently?

Is this salvageable, or did it blow up the trust? I think it would be insane to throw out 5 years over this, but it‚Äôs not my call. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just a little naive with respect to how others might see things so completely differently than me.

A few days ago, a package arrived for him. He wasn't home, so I left it on the kitchen counter. When he got back, he seemed really surprised and almost panicked when he saw the package. I noticed it was from his mom, which confused me, but I didn't say anything at first.

Later that night, while he was in the shower, I saw the package open on the table. Inside was a large sum of money and a note. I was shocked to see how much money his mom had sent him. The note was from her, saying she hopes he's doing well and that she prays every day for his forgiveness. She mentioned something about hoping he can forgive her for the past.

When he came out of the shower, I gently asked him about the package. He became very quiet and his expression turned cold. He simply said it was none of my business. I told him I just wanted to understand because he always said he didn't have a mom. He calmly repeated that he doesn't have a mom and that she's dead to him.

I was taken aback and didn't know what to say. He remained distant and cold, refusing to share anything more with me.

I felt bad for him but also felt bad for his mom. I decided to meet her myself to understand more about the situation. When I met her, I was surprised by how young and beautiful she looked for being the mother of a 21-year-old. She was in her late 30s and seemed genuinely remorseful and concerned about her son. She told me that she had him when she was very young. Shortly after his birth, her parents kicked her out of the house, and his dad left her to fend for herself with a baby. She struggled a lot trying to provide for him, and despite her best efforts, he grew up unhappy and blamed her for his difficult life. He felt that his life was a burden he never asked for, and eventually, that resentment boiled over.

When he turned 17, he packed his things and left without a word. Later, he told her that he wished he was never born and blamed her for bringing him into a life of misery. It was the most painful thing she had ever heard. Since then, she's been trying to reach out to him, sending gifts and notes, hoping he would see how sorry she was and that she never wanted his life to be this way.

I went back and suggested to my boyfriend that he talk to his mom, explaining how she seemed sincere in wanting to make amends. For the first time, his cold demeanor cracked. He looked sad and seemed on the verge of tears. It was a side of him I hadn't seen before, and it broke my heart.

Later that night, I heard him sobbing on the couch, whispering ""Mom"" repeatedly. He didn't notice me standing there, and I felt a pang of sadness for him.

I'm peeved because she hasn't answered my text despite being on her phone for hours, and while the event isn't until this upcoming weekend, I still have to coordinate with other people about rides. I'm also peeved because this isn't a new thing with her - she usually answers my messages towards the end of the day because out sleep schedules are so different, but I feel like if she's obviously on her phone she should at least be checking to see if I messaged, especially when we text so often.

16,1dsfx23,AITA for Proceeding with Balcony Maintenance Despite Neighbor's Objections?,"I live in a condo with a metal balcony that covers only half of the balcony below. Due to poor construction, significant rust developed, and the paint peeled off last year. Last summer, I scrubbed, washed, and repainted it, unaware that water and paint would flow onto the balcony below. I assumed the balcony extended out to a dirt road alley, but photos from the owner below showed my balcony partly within hers, not extending onto the sidewalk‚Äîa design flaw. My husband and I promptly cleaned it.

Unfortunately, rust has returned, prompting me to seek a long-term solution with durable epoxy paint. I need to remove rust and clean off excess paint before applying it, and I've requested permission to tarp her balcony and glass railing below. Despite multiple discussions and texts, she refused to let me put up the tarp, saying things like ""Your tarp won't do any good just like you"" and was unnecessarily rude. She suggested sanding and vacuuming, which we eventually did. However, I warned her that washing down before painting might still result in some residue or cleaning agents washing down.

She often cleans her own balcony and, having no neighbors below, has no problem with runoff. We have been nothing but helpful, ensuring she got her windows fixed, helping with a car charger, and assisting with many other tasks. She is old, and we have always tried to support her.

During a visit to our unit last week, she made several microaggressive, racist remarks, implying that we should have cleaned her balcony for a long time, treating us as though we were her servants. She also mocked and imitated me. When I asked why she was being uncooperative despite all the help I‚Äôve given her, she seemed unappreciative and dismissed my assistance as if it meant nothing. It has also come to my attention that she made comments about us ‚Äúbrown people‚Äù and how we ""make a mess"" to other residents. To clarify, we are extremely clean people and even wipe our dog's paws with wet wipes every time we take her on a walk before letting her back in the house! Despite her racist comments, I offered to hose down and pressure wash her balcony after cleaning mine. We wiped down the entire balcony with wet rags to catch as much of the old paint peel/rust as possible before washing it down! But she did not respond to my messages, declined my calls, and did not answer the door when I knocked.

Given the design flaw, we cannot be blamed for the situation and have tried to find a solution that has gone unacknowledged. The repairs are essential to maintain our balcony's structural integrity above hers and prevent yearly issues. They're urgent before our summer trip due to weather conditions.

17,1dsfv3f,AITA for not going to a party organised by estranged family,"My mom's family had a big fight about 15 years ago because of an inheritance. The main fight was between my mom and dad on the one hand, and my aunts Lorna and Missy on the other hand. The specific cause of the fight is not relevant to this post, but had something to do with pieces of land that were given to some family members before my grandmother's passing and how to count their value. After this fight, a few attempts for reconciliation were made, to no avail. This was all more than 10 years ago. There was no contact with Lorna or Missy ever since. My other aunts Ally, Maeve and Ginny never took a side and are still in touch with both 'parts' of the family.

Five years ago, my mother passed away after she had cancer for 6 months. Lorna and Missy never contacted her while she was ill, but did visit her in the hospital during her last week (when she was not lucid anymore). They did come to the funeral, but did not speak to me. I found it very sad that they never made up while my mom was still alive. We have not been in touch since. 

Now, one of Lorna's daughters organises a BBQ and invited the whole family, including us. I was unsure whether to go, since I got a baby 5 weeks ago and it might be too busy for the baby. I also don't want to leave my baby alone yet.  However, I wanted to go as I saw it as an attempt for reconciliation. 

After a talk to my dad, I decided not to go. He pointed out that none of the estranged family members have congratulated me for the birth of the baby. Also, they have never apologised or said their regrets for not making up while my mom was still alive. He made it clear that it would hurt him if I would go to this party, because I would prioritise the estranged family over seeing him more frequently after having the baby. I do see him once a week, but he would like that to be more often.

18,1dsfrb2,AITA? Not wanting to work for my parent full time b/c I want time to work on my art,"I'm a Digital Arts major college student about to go into my last year of college. To get some money I wanted to apply for a job for the summer until school starts. Originally I was working for my parent at a nail salon they own. Unfortunately, my parent is very inflexible and does not provide a part-time position. The full-time job is working 5 days of the week and about 10 hours everyday and breaks are when there are no customers to work on. This job also, as it is a nail technician job, requires physical contact with others which I am uncomfortable with. But the pay is good because, well, its a full time job and also pay is under the table.

Because of these conditions I've opted to instead work a part-time position as a retailer. Part-time because I do twitch streams on the weekends and I want time to rest my body and be able to work on my art career. 

This choice has caused my family to daily remind me that:  
1) My Parent is exhausted everyday working at the nail salon they own.  
2) I get paid less at the part-time job  
3) My art is useless  
4) I am being ungrateful to my parent.

I understand that my parent is very kind for hiring me and providing me a job when getting a job is a challenge. There's a reason I had to work at my parents place instead of immediately working a job. I also understand that my parent is old and tired from having to work everyday at the company they own. It could be that I am just complaining about nothing and that working a full time job will always be hard.

But I want to work on my art career and hopefully be able to work a job I am more comfortable in. There is merch I want to make and upload and I'm very willing to take commissions anytime. I just don't want to be working a full-time job but my family has framed it as the worst decision and that I'm going to die if I continue.

19,1dsfoz0,WIBTA for leaving my 4th of July hangout with my friends because they won't let me have shrooms,"I (19M) am in a friend group with four other guys: (Sha, 22M), (Aph, 22M), (Kat, 22M) and (Gan, 23M). Our interactions as a friend group are primarily online playing videogames through discord, but we do meet up to play D&D once a week, and often have hangouts for holidays, long weekends, and similar stuff. At our D&D sessions and at these hangouts, all four of them regularly drink alcohol, and two of them (Aph, 22M) and (Kat, 22M) smoke weed. I am aware that Aph, Kat, and Gan have at least some experience with harder drugs

I have never drank nor done any kind of drugs whatsoever, and they know that. They often offer me their blunt or whatever they're drinking once towards the start of the night, I always politely decline, and they've never pushed after that. I‚Äôm not committed to abstinence from drugs/alcohol or anything - on each occasion on which it has been an option, I have just made the individual decision on that night not to. I've always known I‚Äôm just waiting until the day I‚Äôm interested enough to try.

Recently, Aph invited us to his house for the 4th. In discord, Aph brought up potentially doing shrooms on one of the nights. This intrigued me. I am genuinely interested in how it would feel, and it doesn't seem like the opportunity to try shrooms comes around super often. I voiced this interest, and Aph basically shut me down entirely. Not rudely, but definitively. I said it wasn't really his choice to make, and he said that he didn't want to have to worry about my safety/health as I was tripping while he was also tripping. I brought up that he had introduced the idea as if he, Kat, and Gan would all do it, with Sha being offered the opportunity, although they expected him to refuse, and it was therefore somewhat rude and exclusionary for me to be solely unincluded. When I said ‚Äúso Sha can make sure we‚Äôre fine, then,‚Äù it was mentioned that they don't think Sha would be a good caretaker of someone who's tripping due to the fact that he feeds off of pranking people, but that logic just sounded even more ridiculous to me since it holds the implication that I, the person they are saying is too young and innocent to engage with shrooms, am the expected caretaker for all three of them. Sha said he‚Äôs not worried about any of them the same way he‚Äôs worried about me.

I texted Kat about it today as well to get his opinion, and he essentially had the same reaction. ""If we do shrooms, you are indeed not allowed to do them. Hard no.""

I'm pretty pissed that they think they can just decide for me that I'm not allowed to do it with them, but all I've done so far is lightly give up arguing in the two circumstances outlined above. Here's my plan, and what my post is asking about. WIBTA if I show up for the hangout and make it abundantly clear I still want to try, and if they reject me in person too and take the shrooms themselves to have a good time and enjoy tripping, I just go home and later stand by my opinion that they‚Äôre in the wrong for excluding me?

I was hit with them saying I said sorry to get it over with, that BF‚Äôs mental health is more important than mine because he‚Äôs more physically crippled than me, that I never listen, that I have cult mentality (who would‚Äôve guessed), died my feelings down to group chat drama. From this point on, I was degraded into wanting to be better for the sake of wanting it to be over. The entire time, I was more talked at than talked with. AITA?",0.0,0.0784544,0,1
22,1dsflso,AITA for leaving my renting situation when my landlord had been asking for money from me for certain purchases and never came through with it?,"I was renting a room from a person I found on Roomies and they (purposely being vague about gender as I do not know if they browse reddit) began asking me for extra money with expenses that I offered to help pay despite not being obligated to do so. I moved into the rental in mid 2023 and left a few months ago without giving notice as I was in a bad situation. I did not have a rental contract and was on a month to month basis with paying rent.

Looking back the first red flag was when the landlord made moves on me the second night I was there despite having a fianc√©e by asking for a massage. Eventually this came to a point where they were able to manipulate me emotionally to the point of where I felt obligated to give them money; when I said I was not comfortable, they would say ""You'll recover with your next paycheck."" As I believed I felt something for them, I gave them the money without asking questions (stupid, I know). Eventually it came to a point where I was giving them my entire pay and had given them nearly my entire savings; total around 36K in 5 months while rent was 550 a month.

Eventually it came to a point where I had less than 100 dollars in my account and could not pay taxes and I needed to ask my parents for help. They came in and asked for money again, ensuring me I would recover when my paycheck came in. I realize looking back everything was on their terms in the form of how they would ask for things. They would always ask if I had gotten my check and if it had gone through with the bank, and when it did ask for money. They would also always ask for sexual favors, but on their terms, constantly pushing until I gave in. I felt obligated as they promised to lower rent as I had ""Contributed"" so much to the house, but only did to 350 after three months to the original promise via text message; they also said that I would not pay rent, but continued to ask for it (proof in text messages as well). After the taxes situation and telling my family, they helped me get out the night they found out that I was looking for another place as I was afraid I might fall back on my resolve if I conversed with them.

When they called, I told them that it was not working out and they threatened to sue for emotional damages. But when I went to pack my things and leave, they said they would not do so and had nothing against me. As soon as I left I blocked them on all avenues of communication, but they still continue to call me but do not leave voice messages. I have bank statements showing how much money they was sent over the time I was there. AITAH for leaving suddenly and giving no notice?

TLDR: Was manipulated romantically and asked for cash for certain things and eventually reached a situation where I had to ask for financial help from parents.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-01,"AITA for leaving my renting situation when my landlord had been asking for money from me for certain purchases and never came through with it?
