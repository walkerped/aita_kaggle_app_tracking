0,1dtlthi,AITA for telling my friend she was selfish for making her own plans on my wedding day?,"My friend and I are both 27F and have been friends since we were 8 y/o. I got married this past April and she was a bridesmaid in the wedding. About 9 months out from the wedding I learn from my MOH that because this friend doesn't want to pay for a hotel room, she instead had texted the entire bridal party (excluding me and the groom) about booking a large airbnb together with their s/o's. MOH said the group text indicated that this airbnb was for the bridal party but not the bride and groom. This airbnb plan ultimately fizzled out, but I texted my friend/bridesmaid to just to talk with her about how it bothered me that she was trying to make new plans for my wedding party for my wedding weekend without saying anything to me or my now husband. She was very defensive and told me it wasn't a big deal, and dismissed my feelings entirely. The conversation ended and we just didn't have a reason to talk for a while. 

Fast forward to my bachelorette weekend, and lots of wine, and she made some comment about the lodging for my wedding weekend and I snapped at her in front of everyone. I told her that she was selfish and only cared about what she wanted. Later that night we tried to hash things out and I apologized for snapping at her but tried to explain that I did think she was selfish for trying to change my wedding plans without telling me and then also dismissing me when I tried to talk with her about it. I told her it hurt my feelings that as a friend of almost 20 yrs she could care so little about my intentions and opinions of my wedding. When I said she wouldn't appreciate it if the roles were reversed, she told me that she really couldn't entertain that hypothetical bc she wasn't seeing anyone. We smoothed over the conversation that evening but I'm not totally sure that either of us saw the other person's side.

Then leading up to the wedding everything seemed normal again with us and she was enthusiastic about the wedding and left me a thoughtful card on the day of. 

Now that the wedding is over she doesn't speak to me, she didn't tell me she was coming to town multiple times, or that she's moving to the area that I live in. Come to find out she told another friend that she was ""just getting through the wedding"" and had planned to stop talking to me after.

1,1dt9t1v,AITA for sticking up for my child against my husband,"My 15yo son has requested to be able to choose his own baseball gear. For the past few years, my husband (his stepdad) has always bought him his gear. It would be decent gear but some times it would be gear that is on sale but not all the time. Last year my husband got into a huge fit because my son wasn't appreciative of the helmet he bought him. My son said he said thank you but didn't like the design of the helmet. (This was after I told my husband not to buy the helmet and let him choose what helmet he wanted. Ofc husband didn't listen and bought it.). 

My son explained to me that it isn't because he isn't appreciative, he just wants to be able to have a say in what he gets. He sees his teammates being able to and he isn't. This year, I told my husband I was getting him a new bat because he made Varsity and that I was letting him choose. Instead of letting him choose, my husband went ahead and ordered him a bat, gloves, and other stuff. There was an issue with the gloves so I told my husband, why don't you just take him to the store and let him pick? Then it became a full blown argument because apparently until my son starts working, he can't choose and should be grateful he gets anything. Then the husband goes on to say he should have his dad buy his stuff now and live with him all because I ""ran my mouth"". AITA? I would think since my husband played sports before, he'd understand wanting to choose but instead he said he had to be grateful for what he got when he was his age (not entirely true).

2,1dt9r4w,AITA for threatening to leave my mother because she takes long baths?,"Throwaway 

I feel horrible and need to know if I'm the ass. Me and my two children are currently living in my mother's house. This is because my mother was in an accident and can't work anymore. She doesn't get enough benefits to afford to live in her house so we decided that I'd move in with my family and take over the bills. The only thing she pays for is a bit on groceries. I'm fine with this because I think my mother should be able to relax.

Something important to know is my mother has a lot of pain. To help relieve this she takes long, hot baths.  This wasn't an issue before because my children were in school so she had plenty of time to take these baths while they weren't there. The issue is that now that summer has started my children are upset she ""monopolizes"" the bathroom. I know that there is only one bathroom in the house so if she's in the bath they have to wait. Despite this I didn't think it was that bad because surely she isn't in there more then an hour. 

Well I found out l that I was wrong. It started when our neighbor came over to ask if our bathroom is working. When I questioned him he informed me that my children were coming over to his house almost daily to use his bathroom. Now them going over there isn't an issue because he's an old family friend, but I was still shocked. I asked them and they said they have to because their grandmother won't share the bathroom. 

I talked to my mother and she said the girls were being dramatic. I decided to get to the bottom of this because when I'm home she's never in there that long. So I stayed home from work without telling my mother yesterday. I asked my older daughter to text me when she got in the bath. She texted me at about 10:30. I went in to confirm and I could hear her in there. I then waited. She didn't come out until after 3. I was shocked. I could literally hear her drain and refill the tub a few times.

After she got out I confronted her about this because it isn't right my kids don't have access to the bathroom for that long. We ended up getting into a major fight. I told her she can't be in the bathroom that long. She told me it was her house and she could stay in there as long as she wants and I don't understand how much pain shes in. I threatened to leave with my kids and let her deal with the bills if she couldn't be reasonable with the bathroom. She ended up crying and ignoring me the rest of the night.

My children are happy now because she hasn't taken taken a bath in about a week now. I'm worried about her and I feel horrible. I've tried to discuss it but she just tells me she won't cause anymore issues with the bathroom and locks herself in her room.  So reddit I need to know. I'm I the ass here?

3,1dt98y1,AITA for insisting guest put the lid down before flushing? ,"I am 23F and I live with my mom and her boyfriend. When I moved in with my mom I had been working a factory job for two years and had to quit because she lived too far. She told me it didn’t matter and she just wanted me to live with her again. I never got to stay with her for more than a few months at a time as a kid because she was constantly on meth and/or heroine. Now she is clean and I’m very proud of her. When I started college she even told me I didn’t need to search for a job because she was okay with supporting me because she wanted me to go to college. I’ve still been looking for a job on the side and almost got one but it fell through.

My family has never put the toilet seat down. I learned a year or two ago that if you flush without the lid down it will send bacteria and poop particles in the air and onto your toothbrush if you keep it in the bathroom.

At my mom’s place there are three bathrooms. One in her room, one in the hallway next to both our bedrooms and another off from the living room. When I first moved in hers was broken and we shared a bathroom. I asked my mom if she could please put the toilet lid down when she flushed. She said she’d try but might not remember at night if she woke up to use the bathroom. I understood and thanked her for trying. Eventually her bathroom was fixed and my mom told me the hallway bathroom would be my bathroom so this ceased to be an issue entirely.

Today we had a guest over and they needed to use the restroom. I saw after that he had not closed the lid. When my mom went into her bedroom to get something she was giving to the guest I followed her and asked if she was sending someone to my bathroom to let them know to close the lid when they flush. 

She told me she wasn’t going to do that and left the room. I started arguing about it with her in the hallway and we got into a screaming match.

I said there’s three bathrooms in this place and if she won’t ask them that she can just direct them to another bathroom and not the one she told me was mine. She kept saying she wasn’t going to make guest comply with my “quirks” as she calls them. I told her it wasn’t a quirk it was science and sent her videos of medical professionals saying the same thing and an article detailing that e.coli and bacteria can be found in these particles.

She refused to watch them and her boyfriend says I’m making a big deal out of nothing basically and I don’t need to be worried about poop particles if I don’t pay rent. 

I took some tape and put a sign behind the toilet asking to close the lid before you flush. My mom said she’d take it down and I said I’d just put another one up.

7,1dt8dy7,AITA for calling out a guest who wore white to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened a week ago. I (28F) and another girl, M, were invited to my friend’s wedding. We were good friends with the bride in college and stayed in touch afterward. The wedding was amazing. However, there was this one moment I had with another guest that kept me feeling guilty even when I was typing this. 
 
There was a girl who sat at the bride’s family table and wore a bright white dress. I thought it was weird considering guests should not wear white or off-white colors to a wedding. M had some comments saying that it was unacceptable, rude, and inconsiderate because she’s never been to a wedding where guests wear white and then casually walk around, chat with people, and participate in activities. I agreed with her because it was unfamiliar to me too. I suggested that we bring it up with the bride when we have a chance. However, we couldn’t get a hold of her alone for the rest of the night as she was busy going around tables and doing activities. 

I don’t know if it was my instinct to protect my friend or because of my ego, but I decided to take matters into my own hands and walked up (with M after me) to the girl when she sat down at her table. I pointed out that she was being rude for wearing white and for following the bride around while showing off her dress to all the guests. M supported me by agreeing and saying the bride must feel extremely bothered that her guest was trying to ruin her special day. The girl seemed shocked for a bit and said sorry, she didn’t know, and the bride didn’t say anything, so she thought it was okay. I told her that the bride was kind enough to let her stay, cause if I were the bride, she would’ve been kicked out right when she walked through the door in that dress. M said a few more things then we left. I thought my action was justified and felt kind of proud for sticking up for my friend. For the rest of the night, I sometimes looked over the girl’s table and noticed that she didn’t leave her seat until after the wedding was over, and she left with the bride.
 
I contacted the bride a few days after the wedding to thank her for the wedding gifts and for inviting me to her wedding. Then I brought up the girl and asked if my friend was bothered by her at all. To my surprise, she didn’t and even felt happy that the girl did.

The niece even sewed in two swans to symbolize my friend and her husband loving each other eternally. That’s why she was showing off the dress to all the other guests.

I thought I did the right thing but now I just feel like an AH. So Reddit…am I the AH?


Edit: I get it. I’m TAH. But in my defence, the girl’s dress was very pretty like a fairy gown type of dress with a lot of extravagant details that the bride’s dress didn’t have. I didn’t know that it was my friend’s gift to her before calling her out. And I get that I’m ignorant culture-wise, and I will try to think better before acting on my thoughts next time. Thank you all for the criticism. ",Asshole,2024-07-02,"AITA for calling out a guest who wore white to my friend’s wedding? This happened a week ago. I (28F) and another girl, M, were invited to my friend’s wedding. We were good friends with the bride in college and stayed in touch afterward. The wedding was amazing. However, there was this one moment I had with another guest that kept me feeling guilty even when I was typing this. 
 
There was a girl who sat at the bride’s family table and wore a bright white dress. I thought it was weird considering guests should not wear white or off-white colors to a wedding. M had some comments saying that it was unacceptable, rude, and inconsiderate because she’s never been to a wedding where guests wear white and then casually walk around, chat with people, and participate in activities. I agreed with her because it was unfamiliar to me too. I suggested that we bring it up with the bride when we have a chance. However, we couldn’t get a hold of her alone for the rest of the night as she was busy going around tables and doing activities. 

I don’t know if it was my instinct to protect my friend or because of my ego, but I decided to take matters into my own hands and walked up (with M after me) to the girl when she sat down at her table. I pointed out that she was being rude for wearing white and for following the bride around while showing off her dress to all the guests. M supported me by agreeing and saying the bride must feel extremely bothered that her guest was trying to ruin her special day. The girl seemed shocked for a bit and said sorry, she didn’t know, and the bride didn’t say anything, so she thought it was okay. I told her that the bride was kind enough to let her stay, cause if I were the bride, she would’ve been kicked out right when she walked through the door in that dress. M said a few more things then we left. I thought my action was justified and felt kind of proud for sticking up for my friend. For the rest of the night, I sometimes looked over the girl’s table and noticed that she didn’t leave her seat until after the wedding was over, and she left with the bride.
 
I contacted the bride a few days after the wedding to thank her for the wedding gifts and for inviting me to her wedding. Then I brought up the girl and asked if my friend was bothered by her at all. To my surprise, she didn’t and even felt happy that the girl did. She clarified that the girl was her niece who flew from another country to attend her wedding and that the dress she was wearing was a gift from my friend herself. The niece even sewed in two swans to symbolize my friend and her husband loving each other eternally. That’s why she was showing off the dress to all the other guests.

9,1dt8cx3,AITAH for not saying happy birthday to my cousin?,"recently my mom has been calling me a lot. I have been down to answer (I haven’t seen her IRL for a few days because she’s in Virginia) so I’ve been talking with her for a few hours. Today was a bit different though.

When I answered she looked a bit annoyed. I asked her if she was okay and we started to talk. She seemed off. Towards the end of the call, she mentioned that my cousin said I didn’t say happy birthday to him. 

Let me explain:

One of our cousins lives with us because he got an internship near where we live. I was fine with this because I thought it wouldn’t really affect me. A few years go by and I start to realize that he isn’t as nice as I thought he would be.
Recently, ever since I got back from California, he has been really bitchy. It got worse when my mom left for VA. Apparently he has been sending videos of my pet birds being ‘poorly fed’ and ‘not having clean water’ which is simply not true because I litteraly change it TWICE A DAY.
My Grandma recently sent him a Birthday card. I was tasked to go get it for him at the mail box.
I had to go quickly and give it to him fast because I had plans with my friends and was already late.

This was yesterday. I thought it wouldn’t be as big of a deal as it would turn out to be. 

Today the whole ordeal happened. I explained to her that I was on a rush and that I didn’t get the chance to say happy birthday because I was focused on getting to my friends house ASAP. She would go to tell me another story. Apperently I was ‘very rude’ and basically threw the letter at him. I’m surprised she believed HIM because according to litteraly everyone I know, I am one of the nicest people they know. When I tried to explain it again she just hung up on me.

I tried calling her 4 other times but she kept hanging up.

I don’t know when this guy turned on me, but whatever his plan is, I *dont* like it. 

My dad just got home and I explained this whole situation to him. He obviously sided with me and started to talk about how my cousin has ALSO been off around him for whatever reason.

My mom apparently told him the whole bird food and water ordeal. My dad told me in the morning to take videos of me resupplying them. He didn’t tell me why and the time, but he just told me to send them to her as proof that I do in fact take care of them. 

He later told me about the videos being sent to her.

Me and my dad honestly have no idea what the fuck to do. Do y’all have any suggestions? :/",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITAH for not saying happy birthday to my cousin? recently my mom has been calling me a lot.

10,1du0evr,AITA for choosing my friends over my boyfriend’s family?,"My boyfriend (m29) and I (f30) are having our first child together due this month. We had been casual friends for a couple of years but only hung out occasionally and definitely didn't know each others families. We made our relationship official last year and I got pregnant soon after that. In most fronts our relationship is great and we see eye to eye on most everything.


My bf's family is small and he's super close with his mom (f50's?) and his sister (f38). I have met his mom a handful of times but she lives a pretty busy life running church events, community fundraisers, etc. So she has not had a lot of extra time. His sister I only met once in our whole relationship for all of 10 minutes when she was leaving my bf's house as I was coming over. My bf says she talks all of the time about how excited she is for the baby and can't wait to babysit and take baby places etc. But she has never made an effort to spend time with me so I can get to know her. I always found this odd and have asked my bf why we haven't all hung out but he just says he'll ask her when she's free although she's also pretty busy. She doesn't live far from me, and lives with her husband and stepchild who is 18.  


So here's the incident. My dad is getting remarried next month. He is getting married in his fiancée's hometown which is a 7 hour drive away from us. My baby will be too little to travel or be around so many people so bf and I agreed she should stay here. And yes my bf is going with me because he and I are both part of the ceremony as he is close to my dad. I told my bf on Sunday that I had asked my two best friends to watch the baby for the weekend we will be away. They agreed and are happy to do it.


My bf said he assumed we would ask his sister to babysit. That his sister is actual family and she was looking forward to the opportunity. I told him that I just don't feel comfortable with that since I don't really know her. My bf got insulted and said but HE knows her and trusts her with his (and the baby's) life. We went back and forth with reasonings- mine being she hasn't made an effort to get to know me my entire pregnancy, but my friends have invited bf to dinner with them on multiple occasions etc. And my bf repeating that if I trust him, and he trusts his sister, that should be good enough.


He then asked me if he could set up times for his sister and I to spend time together, especially after the baby is born to build up trust for her to watch our baby by the wedding. I responded that it wasn't enough time and she should have made the effort way before I'm due to give birth in a couple weeks. He then accused me of choosing my friends over his family to be petty and called me ridiculous for not even giving her a chance to make up for it in the next 6 weeks. AITA for not budging on having my friends watch the baby instead of his family?



*Edit to mention I have invited sister to dinner but sister canceled on us because she was busy with laundry, cleaning house etc. I later found out she went to a casino with her husband instead which my bf even admitted he didn't understand how she had time for that but not to have dinner with us. I suggested we go see a movie I know they both would like and bf said it was okay I didn't need to go, because his sister bought the two of them tickets already and made plans together since ""she knows you (I) don't like horror movies"".",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITA for choosing my friends over my boyfriend’s family?

11,1du07he,AITA for consistently asking my ‘friend’ for money,"I understand how the title sounds, like I’m begging for money for no reason. But there is a reason. 

Me and my ‘friend’, who I’ll call Bella for the sake of this post, [not her real name], have had a lot of ups and downs. Moreso downs. She’s manipulative, a gaslighter, always wants to be the center of attention, etc. after school ended, I planned on ending my friendship with her so I didn’t have to deal with her, as she is in majority of my classes so I didn’t see doing that any earlier as a solution.

 Recently, I was stupid enough to let her borrow one of my books, near the beginning of the school year. She promised it back within a month or two, now, 9 months later, schools over. No book returned. 

Now, I don’t have a lot of money, so I had to save up for even that cheap book, and not having it back upsets me because it is mine, and I like to have every book I’ve read on display since I don’t read often and it makes me proud to know I have. Since the school year was over, I messaged her about getting it back, even asking for it weeks before school ended, which had gotten no reply or a ‘I keep forgetting.’ I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt, which I shouldn’t have. Again, for the past month, every day, I’ve been messaging her for it back, since schools over. She claims she gave it to Jamie [fake name], another friend of ours, claiming that Jamie was supposed to give it back. Now I’m telling Bella she owes me money since it was last set in her possession and we have zero contact with Jamie. I would’ve loved to drop her as a friend by now but I would really like the money back. Messages I’ve got in response from her consist of ‘idk’, ‘I have no clue what to do’, and tons of times of her simply ghosting me, even though I see her online and reading my message [snapchat]. The books relatively cheap, 15 dollars, plus I even made it only 10 for her since it’s not completely her fault? 

I’ve gotten plenty of friends saying I’m petty, and plenty saying it’s completely reasonable.

13,1du04i7,AITA for throwing away my step parent's clothes?,"For some context, I (ftm18) live with my older brother, Noël (m32) and his fiancé, Meg (f34). I do usually refer to my brother as my dad, because he is the person who had raised me, and from a young age, I've always been guided to call a plethora of Noël's women some variation of 'mam'. Meg is probably his longest relationship, they've been together since I was twelve.

Couple of months back, my long distance boyfriend, Dallán (m21) was finally able to fly over from his home country, and it led to me ending up pregnant with our kid - I'm currently five months. As Dallán couldn't realistically stay in the country due to work, emigration issues and uni, it's Noël and Meg who have been supporting me throughout the past five months.

They've both been lovely, Noël would take time off work just to drive me to and from my a-level exams, Meg's quite good at scouring charity shops for stuff for the wee lad. I do think it's gets a bit hectic and rough at times though, we live in a smallish two bedroom flat and it's kind of cramped and super expensive because we rent privately, so arguments aren't that uncommon, but we get along otherwise.

One of the main disagreements I have with Meg is on the issue of clothes. I can't lie, I think maternity clothes are ugly as sin, I point blank refuse to ever put any type of it on. At the same time, clothes are hard for me to fit into at this stage. I do like 90s vintage type stuff, so I often go to these like, curated vintage shops to get old levis, or vintage carhart and nike, and I've been having to do it even more often now because half my clothes are too small at this point. It usually makes me mardy and pure miserable because I feel like a ballooned elephant, and Meg tries to sort it by getting me some ugly ugly ugly maternity clothes from sainsbury that make me look like someone's middle aged mam.

I've told Meg a gazillion times to stop it, I told her that I love her but not enough to put the ghastly garbs on. I've reminded her of what I usually wear and that I even casually modelled for a bit, am not  going to throw my dignity away so easily. She's made it into a bit of a laugh, so I thought she'd have understood but she just keeps buying it!

Since Meg won't stop forcing the clothes into my closet, I've started bagging them up and taking them down to those huge recycling bins you get for clothes. It's upset her and its caused arguments, with Meg calling me vain, to think about the baby before stuffing my body in small waisted levis and ungrateful.

14,1dtzw7y,AITAH For asking my gf to go home so I can have some alone time?,"Hey, first time here. I, M(25) wanted to make a post because I was uncertain about a decision and conversation I had with my GF (26). In the past we’ve had a conversation about me wanting to have alone time, particularly because I have hobbies I like to do alone with no distractions (music and gaming, and also work) Additionally I live with my parent and work from home. This time I told her I need more space, she freaked out, packed her things and left. She apologized, sort of. But I still feel like a dick.

My gf works some days on an odd schedule because she picks when she works. I work from home, and when she’s not home, she leaves her 3 dogs, that I care for during that time. I also have 2 dogs and two cats, and sometimes it’s a lot to manage while working from home. Additionally, I just want to be able to finish work and have studio sessions in my own time without her hovering, but I haven’t been able to because she’s with me constantly. So it’s work, gym, cook, clean, bed. I just want my space. 

Her argument is that it’s makes no sense I want alone time if I want to get my own place with her. She wonders how we’re going to manage it. I think that’s a fair point, but I’ve always had boundaries. I’ve been lenient because she hates her apartment and doesn’t want to live her brother, but for her it saves money compared to a solo apartment. Because of this, I feel bad telling her to go home. AITAH",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITAH For asking my gf to go home so I can have some alone time? Hey, first time here. I, M(25) wanted to make a post because I was uncertain about a decision and conversation I had with my GF (26). In the past we’ve had a conversation about me wanting to have alone time, particularly because I have hobbies I like to do alone with no distractions (music and gaming, and also work) Additionally I live with my parent and work from home. This time I told her I need more space, she freaked out, packed her things and left. She apologized, sort of. But I still feel like a dick.

My gf works some days on an odd schedule because she picks when she works. I work from home, and when she’s not home, she leaves her 3 dogs, that I care for during that time. I also have 2 dogs and two cats, and sometimes it’s a lot to manage while working from home. Additionally, I just want to be able to finish work and have studio sessions in my own time without her hovering, but I haven’t been able to because she’s with me constantly. So it’s work, gym, cook, clean, bed. I just want my space. 

Her argument is that it’s makes no sense I want alone time if I want to get my own place with her. She wonders how we’re going to manage it. I think that’s a fair point, but I’ve always had boundaries. I’ve been lenient because she hates her apartment and doesn’t want to live her brother, but for her it saves money compared to a solo apartment. Because of this, I feel bad telling her to go home.

15,1dtzvyj,AITAH forlosing interest in my ex-bestfriend?,"In high school, I met a punk/rock girl, Nana, and we quickly became friends. However, on the same day, she got into an argument in our chat group, and I stood up for her. This led to years of bullying against me. Despite feeling uneasy around her, I always defended Nana and stayed by her side. She was the type of friend who blamed me for everything and never supported me. She would vent about her family and mental health but dismissed my problems, calling me stupid and unworthy of help. This made me scared of seeking help from others, even when I struggled. I had a traumatic childhood, with a cancer-stricken, narcissistic mother, poverty, and bullying.

Nana frequently put me down, mocking my insecurities, weight, and appearance, and even called me not so nice names without reason. She would join my bullies despite my previous protection of her. She poisoned my perception of others to isolate me and spread lies about me. She also mocked my sexuality and laughed when I’ve got my heart broken. Sometimes, she would physically hurt me as a joke or make me do bad things.

The final straw was at a party where she abandoned me to flirt with an older man, leaving me feeling unwanted. Her friends, who I didn’t know before, made me feel secure, and we had a fun night. However, as the party ended, I felt very sick from drinking too much. I suggested we leave, but She just cuffed. We walked her friends home, and as we neared her house, she planned to leave me alone with her abusive, creepy father while she visited her boyfriend’s flat. I begged her not to, but she left me, leaving me terrified. I texted her about my disappointment and left early in the morning. She was angry that I left before she returned.

After this, I grew colder towards her. Although we were still classmates, she eventually transferred to another school, and I never messaged her. Yet, she continued to try to contact me, which creeped me out. I remembered more incidents: helping her get papers she didn’t thank me for, her hurting me during hairdressing practice, her talking about cheating despite my bad experiences with it, constantly asking for food and money but refusing to share, and trying to set me up with strangers despite my discomfort.

After high school, I got into an art university despite Nana’s doubts, and I’ve just finished my first year, feeling better than ever. She still tries to contact me through mutual friends, but her messages bring back bad memories. She recently mocked my appearance again, reminding me why I distanced myself from her.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITAH forlosing interest in my ex-bestfriend?

16,1dtzo08,AITA for telling my roommate they need to be more clean,"My roommate and I have lived together for six months and have had consistent fights about cleanliness and hygiene. 

Our first fight was about cleaning the kitchen after cooking. It's a shared space, and after I cook, I always make sure to clean things up and leave them nice out of consideration for the other person. However, they would cook and leave grease all over the stove, leave food on the counter instead of in the sink, and let dishes or food sit until it molded, without ever cleaning it up. This started to attract bugs, so I talked to them about it. They were upset, but eventually started to clean up the grease they left behind. However, they still leave food on the counter and let things mold.

The second argument, which really bugged me, is about how they leave their belongings everywhere. Of course, in an apartment, you're going to have some of your belongings in shared areas, and that's fine. However, this has become legitimate clutter and is really affecting our ability to do anything in the apartment. They leave boxes, large pieces of wood, dead plants, dirty socks, food on the kitchen table, laundry on our coffee table, and refuse to clean their room so they can have more space to put things.

They blamed me for putting stuff back into their room and said that I shove things in there. But that's not what I'm doing. When I clean, which I'm the only one who does, I put their dirty clothes and belongings back where they should be. Because their room is so dirty, they find it difficult to find things, but I don't think that's my fault. 

They also left their bike in the middle of the living room for months and didn't move it out of the way. When I try to communicate with them about cleaning up their side of the apartment, they say they legally can do whatever they want and are very difficult to talk to.

17,1dtz547,AITA for refusing to split all expenses equally on a trip with my partner and a friend ,"In September I (32f) and my partner (30m) are going camping with my friend (36f). My partner and I are sharing a campervan and my friend is sleeping in a tent. I wanted to book the accommodation and ferry crossings separately from eachother but was happy to split the petrol and food costs during the trip. 

I booked the campsites and ferry crossings for our trip. Our campervan is more expensive than her car or her tent. For the trip, it will cost my partner and I £50 each for the campsite and it will cost my friend £75. So she will pay £25 more than each of us. 

For the ferries it will cost us £134 and her £116. So we will be paying £67 each and she will pay the £116. So she will pay £49 more. 

If I take the total cost of everything (our campsite + her campsite + her ferries + our ferries) I worked out that she would only be paying £49 extra to pay for herself than if we split everything 3 ways. She’d pay £206 rather than £157 if we split it all equally.

We have fallen out and she says I am an asshole because it will cost her £49 more than it would if we split everything three ways.

Just to add extra detail, we have agreed to split petrol 3 ways (which will again make the trip cheaper for her and more expensive for us) and food costs will also be split 3 ways. 

Additionally, there is another campsite on our trip that my partner and I can stay at for free but she will cost £45. We readily agreed to pay £15 each towards her cost, saving her £30. 

Also, (she says this isn’t relevant, but I disagree) she earns more than twice my partner’s salary and I am recently unemployed. So we need to keep this trip as cheap as possible.  For us, the extra £49 to pay for her camping and ferry is a lot. She is very well off with fewer outgoings.

18,1dtyqea,AITA for not giving my aunt a plus 1 to my wedding?,"Am I in the wrong? 

I will try to make this as concise as possible:

1. We are having a very small wedding due to financial constraints - 50 people in total including wedding party 

2. My mom has passed away, my bio dad and his family were never in my life (explaining why there are less of my family members invited than his)

3.  Our wedding party is 14 people, we have 36 guests, 10 of those are girlfriends/boyfriends/fiances of the someone in the wedding party 

4. I have 8 family members invited, he has 18 (since he has both sides of his family involved in his life) 


The issue is as follows:

We were given a strict headcount of 50 for the wedding (we are 2 over including bride and groom). Therefore, when sending out invitations we only sent “plus 1’s” to those who were actively in relationships. My aunt is not included in that group as her and her boyfriend broke up about 3 months ago now. We have also not included many close friends and extended family members since we have literally no room. 

My aunt who received an invitation for one rsvpd the other day saying she would be coming and bringing a date with her. I responded as kindly as I possibly could saying we were given a strict head count and we have no wiggle room because we are unfortunately already over the amount of people we are allowed anyways. 

My grandma called me today screaming bloody murder about how I was completely in the wrong, she gave me $2,000 for the wedding and she expects me to allow her child to bring a date and that especially after she just broke up with her long term boyfriend she won’t want to come alone and probably won’t come at all now, I am tearing the family into a million pieces and that I am a bitch. 

Am I in the wrong? I am trying my best to balance everything and appease everyone but I genuinely just wish we had eloped at this point. My FHs grandma has already gotten upset that he is not inviting his extended family either and I tried to explain that to my grandma but she only said she would never be able to forgive me for this and hung up.

After we got married, we decided it’d be better for me to stay at home, to better take care of the house and our future children. 

Since the beginning his mother, Diana, 67f, has had it out for me, she’s very overly protective of my husband, since her husband and Ben’s father died when he was little, so they grew close. she has always accused me of being unfaithful, lackluster in household chores and not enough for Ben on numerous occasions, but this time was the worst.

”How can you possibly allow your wife to cheat on you? Isn’t enough how she treats you?” he went silent, and I confronted her. she answered that Kevin’s arm was around my shoulder on the picture, which allegedly was a sign of affection.

I tried to interrupt her banters and explain it all, but she didn’t listen and instead started to berate other aspects of myself, deep insecurities, I then yelled at her that she was insufferable and meddled in others peoples lives and to leave, which she did afterwards.

After it all was said and done, my husband was very angry at me and told me his mother was an elderly lady and I should’ve been patient with her and now I humiliated myself, him and his mother in front of everyone.

However, he does not seem to come prepared nor does he reach out when he has questions. He has been known to give wrong answers without checking.

Recently, he was given work that I should be getting a commission on. He asked me to review his work but it was so incomplete that I had several questions. We met again several days later and the same questions were still unanswered. After about 25 minutes into call #2, he makes a comment, I should get a pen and take notes. 

I suggested a forum where he could post one of the questions. He chose to approach the question differently but after 2 days he had not gotten an answer and someone else was following up for him. I was cc'd on the email so I posted to the forum and had the answer in less than 10 minutes.

Let me preface this by saying that there were TWO rooms. One room had 2 queen sized beds in it and the other had just one bed. Obviously birthday girl and her boyfriend slept in the one room. And her boyfriend’s brother and his girlfriend were going to stay in the other room with my boyfriend and myself. This was planned beforehand. As soon as we got to the hotel, my boyfriend and I were checking out the room and I said “So which bed do you guys want?” And the brother said “What? No way” and claimed the ENTIRE double room, basically implying that he wanted privacy to bang his girlfriend all weekend. I said “Wait a min, where are we supposed to sleep?” They said “the bunk beds in the hallway.” I didn’t even notice them but basically there were two twin sized bunk beds in the tightest squeeze of a hallway and they expected us to sleep on those when there was a perfectly sized Queen bed in one of the rooms. I would have fit on one perfectly fine because I’m small but my boyfriend would have definitely been uncomfortable. We also would have had to share the bathroom, which was inside their room, so how would we go about using it in the middle of the night with their door locked, or in the morning waiting for them to wake up?

 I (F39) have been  with my long distance (3hrs drive)  partner (M43) for 3 years.  No option of living closer for at least another 2 years.  So the time we do have is precious.

My brother is due to visit from overseas, with his wife and kids. He visits about every 5 years and hasn't met partner.The trip has been planned for over 6 months, and they will only be here 5 days before travelling on. When they confirmed their visit I asked my OH if he would be able to arrange to visit for a few days to meet him/possibly book a few days off work. He agreed and said he'd book the time off. 

He forgot to book the time off and tbf i forgot to follow up. About 2 months ago I asked him again. He then looked at the date and realised that the 5 days he was visiting now clashed with his best friend's wife being due for a planned c section. He then said he wouldnt come as he "" wanted to be close in case he was needed during the birth"". I expressed that imo was unnecessary, having had 2 babies myself I said I couldnt imagine a role that the father's best friend needed to play until after baby had arrived and been brought home. He disagreed and refused to discuss it. He didnt acknowledge that he'd previously agreed to visit with me, and described that weekend as "" always off the cards"".  I was really hurt but didnt push it. I clarified- his friend had NOT asked him to be available - its a commitment he has taken upon himself. 

Later,  plans developed more and it because clear that my estranged sister ( NC for 18 months) was also going to be there. This made me very anxious and i wished even more that partner could be there

AIBI to think there could have at least been a discussion? that to just blanketly say he cant come to even 1 of the 5 days was unfair? I feel like im being told very clearly i dont matter. I have asked him for something important to me, and he has instead chosen to do something for a friend he hasnt even been asked to do, and frankly is not as "" normal/expected"" as he insists it is -or is it? 

I feel embarassed that I have to tell my brother my partner isnt coming to meet him and anxious about seeing my sister again without my partner's support.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITA for wanting my partner to visit me and my brother while his best friend's wife was having first baby?

I (15 F) shared a class with a guy (16 M) for the past 3 years one we first met in that class he developed a crush on me (I'm a lesbian) and tried to ask me out multiple times. 

After saying no 25 times in 4 months I had enough and told him to back off

He indeed didn't, and bought me Starbucks to make up (I do in fact not like Starbucks at all) 

This year he went to far I had new friends and one of them has a pretty nice figure just like me (in his oppinion) what he would do is stand at the bottom of the stairs to look at us going up if we were wearing skirts tight shorts or dresses

Our school forgot to add the stairs in the floor plan so theire pretty steep so you can see everything easily 

At P.E he's grab us by our waist/chest while playing tag or dodgeball and would look under our skirts and dresses if we bended down or leaned against a table to talk with friends. 

Once he stole my period products to prove a point or something that he was alpha? I don't even know what that means only thing I knew is that I bled true my clothing

35,1dtvidm,AITA because I get upset over watching a soccer game?,"On phone. Sorry for the formatting.
I'm on vacation at my boyfriend's home country in Europe. Today we had an appointment to buy an used car for me. So we asked my brother in law (M27?) to drive us 1h30 to pick it up. BF (M21) doesn't drive. BIL decided to invite his girlfriend (F20). I don't speak their language but in general they try to include me by speaking English. 
We had an hour to kill and we were hungry so we decided to go to a kebab shop. It turns out our appointment was at the same time as the game Turkey vs Austria. We order and a few minutes in, BF asks to delay the car appointment by 1h so they could watch the first time of the game. I'm not included in this thought process and frankly it bothers me. Also, they know VERY well I don't enjoy soccer. Well, the half ends and it turns out they decided to stay for the rest of the game. They decided it without include me. At this point, I get really mad. I feel disrespected and ignored. My BF response is to get really mad too. My argument is that this wasn't the plan, I wasn't consulted and I'm stuck doing something I didn't sign up for. His argument is that I'm being ungrateful and that my BIL and his GF have ""priority"" because they are driving us to the appointment and if they want to stay, we should. I 100% understand they are doing us a favor, but we're paying for gas and forcing me to do something I don't want to do. If at least they would have been nice about it and asked me.

36,1dtv6n6,AITA for not giving my struggling dad any money?,"I am a 21 year old woman living with my big sister and my dad. I am a university student with a part time job. 

This part time job makes me £11.95 for 8 hours a day, 2 days a week, making £764.80 a month from this job. This goes to commuting to and from university, my job requires me to travel between clients which I pay for, my cat’s food, litter and other essentials, my phone bill and my own food. 

My dad asks me for £400 a month to “help” him. I understand that he could be struggling financially and that he might need some help, but £400 is ridiculous, this would mean a majority of my work will go to him. When I ask for a specific reason as to why, he just says that he needs the money and that he has a lot to pay. My dad is not a gambler or anything, so the money isn’t going to any bad habits. He already gets £500 a month from my big sister. 

He often asks me to pick up more shifts and to make for money, when I say that I don’t want to he says, “is it because you don’t want to give me any of it, do you think working less will mean you have to give me less money, because that’s not why I am asking you to do it, it’s for your own good.” I am working less because I want to, because I don’t want to work more than I have to and also partly because the more money I make, the more money he will expect. 

I am always helping him with parking tickets, appeals, government related things, emails etc. and have done so since I was a child. He has 8 children including me and the other children live in a different house in our home country and I can imagine the financial burden that is, but it feels like a little look into my future, how I wouldn’t be able to do anything since all my disposable income will be going to him. 

One thing I would like to add is that when I didn’t have a consistently paying job he didn’t ask me for money, which leads me to believe he is not struggling as much as he says he is. Why does it only come up when he is aware of my income? It irritates me to my core when he calls me in my payday asking for the money and gives me a vague reason as to where my money would be going and proceeds to guilt-trip me with the amount of hours he works and the amount of things he has to pay. 

He pays £1000 a month to an optional “saving” thing that some extended family members do, which is that they give that much money every month and each month it all goes to one of them, basically a saving program. He also pays for my sister’s cosmetic classes and my brother’s computer science classes, which are both things my dad said would be good for them, and are both extracurriculars. And I’m thinking , if you really are struggling, why are you asking me for money before you cut out the costs you don’t even need to give.

37,1dtv4ju,AITA for telling my dad my stepmom isnt my mom and never will be? ,"Hi, I'm (15f) and my dad(39m) started dating my stepmom(29f) a few months after my mom died last October.

I was happy for him, but I told him I wanted him to take it slow, they, however, got married just two months after dating. 

Even while dating there was several issues, first off, he was late to my own bday and blamed it on me because ""he thought I was still getting ready"" he was over an hour late 
to the restaurant

There's also several other instances of him wanting us all (me, my two brothers, him, step mom, and step brother) to all hang out and yet he would only be with them. Now this isn't too bad, but it still hurt. 

Recently, with the marriage, it hasn't been going too well. He still puts them first and even my younger brother (13m) has said he doesn't believe my dad cares about us. He allows my step brother (8m) to basically get away with everything. 

He never picks up after himself, I'm forced to, and just the other day he spit his drink at me in a restaurant and my dad said to deal with it because he was a kid and I did the same when I was his age. 

I didn't do the same, and even if I did my dad wouldn't have known. My dad wasn't in my life until I was 12 because he was in jail and stuff, but that's a different story. 

He has basically put his new family above us and it has been really affecting our relationship. 

Well my stepmom said something about us having mother/daughter time and it irked me the wrong way. I just smiled and said whatever and sounded fun, but later I told my dad how I didn't feel comfortable with her calling me her daughter or me calling her mom. 

I'm already 15, I had a mom who I loved and cared for, I don't need another one.

Well this made my dad really upset. He started yelling and said that I had to get over the past and move forward, and how I needed to start treating my stepmom and stepbrother as my real mom and brother. 

I mostly just sat there and stayed silent, it's what I usually do when he yells at me. He called me ungrateful and said how it didn't matter because I was a terrible daughter to my actual mother. This is where I broke down and begged him to shut up, he didn't. So I just went to my room and cried. 

I was always closer to my mom than dad, so it really hurt hearing him say that. 

Anyways, since then I've mostly been keeping to myself, coming out only when he tells me to clean up after them and for church. My dad is a preacher and believes that since God forgave him I have to. 

I know the death was rough on him so I'm trying to understand and not get mad, but it's difficult. I know I'm not the best daughter but it still hurts hearing him yell and berate me every chance he gets. I've been talking to my younger brother more about it, and he feels the same way.

38,1dtv2ny,WIBTA - don’t want to go on family vacation for the full time,"Essentially, my family is going to Croatia for a full 4 weeks starting at the end of the month to visit family and relax. It sounds good on paper, but the whole family would, every other year, go to Croatia throughout my childhood and as I grew up for a full month or longer.

Most recently, for example, I went a full month with my sister and father 2 years ago, and let’s just say it was the worst trip I ever had. It was very unpleasant - fights, family drama, gossiping, and relatives trying to turn my back against other relatives. I hate that kind of stuff and being in the middle of all of that. I would call them toxic (except my brother).

This trip at the end of the month is going to be with the full family - both of my sisters, younger brother, and parents. I told them upfront how I thought a month was way too long (and it did feel way too long for me on other trips like the most recent one), and that I would go for 3 weeks. They booked for flights for the 4 weeks anyway.

They urged me to go on the full 4 week trip for many reasons, but the key reason was that this is likely going to be the last family trip we ever do (with the full, entire family). Granted, the last few times my family has been to Croatia, it would only be one or two members going but not everybody.

We are all getting older. I am 25 years old (F), my sisters are 28 and 31, and my brother is 22. My parents are also aging and either reaching their 60s or above it.

I think they have a point. This is likely our last trip, we don’t know 100% if it’s the last one, but it’s time I can’t ever get back with them if it is. I rarely see my siblings anyway (because of school, jobs, etc.) But really, the only way I’m even considering on even going is for my brother, who is really dear to me and I’m really close with. Other than that, I would not be going at all. They always do the same, repetitive things over there and we never see anything new so it feels redundant for me going there. I told them I’d go the full 4 weeks if we explore more and hop around the coast, and they seemed down for it, but I’m afraid if I go we will not do that since we really have no concrete plans and given the history of doing the same things over and over again.

I don’t know what to do; and I have to buy the flight ASAP since prices are rising.

It feels like they really want me to go a full 4 weeks, would it be bad if I just fly in a week later to make it 3 or should I just suck it up and go with them?

If I fly in a week later, I think it would be harder on them logistically since somebody would have to come and pick me up to get to where we are staying (2 hours from the airport), so I also feel bad for cutting it to 3 weeks as I don’t want to burden them

It was at that point where he was working with her 8-10 hours a day and texting a lot when he was home. 
I told him that I don’t feel comfortable with that and it is too much for me, he said he understands and cut back a little bit on texting with her. 
Major event happened where I completely lost it. She got in an accident in the middle of the night and first thing she did was call him. My husband immediately drove to her and stayed the whole night until morning. Yes he told me before he went. I wasn’t ok with that situation. I may have overreacted but I still don’t get it why would she call him, why would he pick up when she calls in the middle of the night (it was 2am) and why would he stay all night until around 7am. 
We had a major fight and I told him that I don’t feel comfortable that he has any private contact with her anymore. 
He didn’t understand and therefore didn’t respect that, and he kept texting with her behind my back. 
Keep in mind that at this point I had trust issues because he once already cheated by only texting on Snapchat including sending and receiving nudes (with another girl).
I had an depressive episode at that time and forgave him as it wasn’t easy for him either. 

So they kept contact and it got to the point where she was giving him random little gifts, like chocolate, gaming and anime stuff. 
I really didn’t like that and after a talk with my husband he send her a text to not give him any gifts anymore. 

Also I never liked that they had private contact it continued, as he said I shouldn’t keep him from having friends. But I really couldn’t stand that idea of them both being friends. Idk if I overreacted.

Fast forward to April we moved to another city, my husband got a new job and we said we give our relationship a new start. 

Today I found out that he is still texting with her there were a lot messages between them, I didn’t read them though.
He promised he would cut contact with her as we do our restart. 

Now I am hurt and feel disrespected and am mad at him, actually I don’t know what to do.

He says that he didn’t think it was that bad as he just texted with her again after a long time. He understands that I’m mad but I don’t think that he would stop. 

Am I overreacting? Am I the asshole? 
But also as hard as I try to be ok with it, every single part in me is against it and I just can’t. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITA for having a fight with my husband because he still talks to his old coworker AITA for having a fight with my husband?

41,1dtu9n1,WIBTA if i called police on my neighbors for their excessively noisy child. ,"I (32F) live in a pretty nice apartment complex. I've lived here for 8 months now. Everything is state of the art, well manicured, quiet and nice. Recently things changed because I have new neighbors (husband wife and 3yo child) that have moved in upstairs (directly above me) maybe five months ago. We have high ceilings and hardwood floors. Ever since they moved in it has been constant noise at all hours. For the first few months, I cut them some slack because I assumed they were probably getting situated, unpacking, moving furniture and hadn't got a chance to put rugs down, etc. I also am aware that sound carries quite a bit in an empty apartment so I was trying to give them some time. I took it upon myself to get multiple fans and sound machines. I even bought earplugs however I live alone and I am not so comfortable with not being able to hear my surroundings. I also am aware that they have a very young child. Why you ask?
Because I constantly hear that child running, jumping, screaming, crying, etc. There have been multiple occasions that they have had all of their windows and patio doors open and the child is just screaming for upwards of 15 minutes... part of me feels bad because I understand that kids will be kids and I am sure that it is difficult parenting a little one at that age. The child has a right to play and have fun in their own environment. I personally do not have children so l am trying even harder to be considerate of this.
However, being that the noise is at all hours (12am, 5am, 2am, 2pm, etc) I fail to understand when this child rests and what kind of environment they have going on up there. I know it is not technically my business, but when I am not able to sleep thr the night, take a nap, sit on my patio, or take zoom calls for v. because of the background noise, it is my business. One weekend after three days of constant noise I was at my breaking point and decided to type up a note saying ""hey! Welcome to the complex.

If you could try to keep it down a little bit during the evening hours, that would be great."" (I didn't want any problems, so of course I did not sign it.) I left it on their door. Absolutely nothing changed. I have contacted the leasing office multiple times now to ask them to please contact them and have them keep it down.
This has not worked either. I sent an additional note asking them yet again to please keep it down. They took the note and put it back on my door..... I am at my breaking point.

Ella and i are both moving out of state soon and we have birthdays very close to each other, so my parents booked us a trip to celebrate. 

we got lucky and ended up with a room with way more beds than we needed, because that’s all they had. once i told Ella this she immediately invited her boyfriend without running it past me. my parents and i were the ones paying for everything. and even if Nate was willing to pay for himself, i don’t want a stranger on my family vacation…

43,1dtt8h1,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to block his family?,"So I (26) have been with my boyfriend (34) for a year and a half. I have met his family maybe four times total. It’s always been cordial but he has told me that there is a history of his mom being emotionally abusive to him as well as his sister, and his Dad is pretty complacent. I think his Dad enables them, but that’s my opinion. Also, his Mom has a gambling problem that their Dad funds and that has resulted in multiple family bankruptcies in the past.

A couple of weeks ago, I went over to their house to talk about moving into a new apartment with my boyfriend. While I was there I was stressed about if we were to move because I knew the financial burden would be mostly on me and it gave me anxiety. They were comforting and that visit was fine; we ended up not moving.

Fast forward to this past Friday. My boyfriend’s Mom called him on his drive home from work, and we went on a walk after. On this walk, he told me his Mom called him and asked me for $2,500.00 and was freaking out about it because the water heater at their house exploded and she was the only one around and the plumbers needed the money. Obviously, since she isn’t MY Mom and I barely know them, I said no and told him to call his Dad. Before he could, his Mom was blowing up his phone, so he picked up another call during our walk where she was just asking why I wouldn’t give her the money and why we wouldn’t help her. My bf asked her if she wanted to talk to me, because it was my money, and she said no she wouldn’t talk to me she just needed the money. After she hung up (angrily) he called his Dad like I said he should, and well… his dad was HOME. Which pissed us off, because obviously his Mom was lying to us. We figured she probably gambled the money, which isn’t crazy to think because of her financial history. 

Long story short, this resulted in a horrible weekend where my boyfriend’s Mom, sister and Dad continued lying more and more to cover this up, his Mom throwing a fit and disowning him then regretting it and apologizing to him a million times. The money ended up being bail for a family member but I really don’t even care what it was for at this point. I think after treating me this way and for treating him badly, they need to be cut out of his life. My bf is saying he’ll distance himself but not fully cut them out. And, because there is no hard boundary being set, we are five days into this and his Mom texted ME today saying “Sorry for how we treated (name of boyfriend) and how that made you feel” which like… she should probably apologize for asking me for thousands of dollars and not for how I feel, but okay.

We met up, chatted a bunch, and decided to room together. We're both participating in NROTC at school so our early wake up times for PT will match perfectly.

We spoke a lot about our preferences for dorms and both submitted the housing application requesting each other. A couple weeks ago we were assigned our housing assignments and we were matched to a triple in a pretty low rated dorm at our school (used to be listed on Business Insider's worst dorms in America). We were distraught and tried finding swaps to newer dorms with zero luck. I personally accepted the fact this will be my dorm this fall and created a gc with our third roommate and room suite mates and I connected well with them. My originally planned roommate refused to speak in this chat but whatever. I started getting a little annoyed with him when he started doggin on our roommate for being a generational legacy student, and talking about how he was only accepted because his parents.

I think where IATA is because we promised to stick together in a double and while I was away at a camp he was scouting doubles and even found a single swap option in one of the nicer dorms but turned it down because he couldn't find one for me. When I got back I started looking with him but at this point all the good stuff was taken. Before I found out our room was renovated I introduced the idea of swapping to a double in the lower dorm, and he really liked the idea because it would be a very easy swap since literally everyone in the low dorm wanted to swap out. We contacted some people, found a match, but then a student from our current dorm sent a video of our exact triple and it went from all old carpet and furniture to vinyl floors, nice desks, night stands, and they even redid walls for bigger windows and a larger room so the triples were no longer forced in a space the size of a double. I showed him the video and asked if we just stay in our triple since it's renovated, but he refused and said we needed to go to a double. This is where the arguing happened.

She had just left not much before then so I answered anticipating a flat tire or car trouble etc. She proceeds to tell me that another coworker of ours followed her home and she wasn't sure what to do. I told her to be careful but to wake up her husband and tell him and call the cops.  That was the gist of a 61 minute conversation and that's pretty much what was repeated.  Comes out the next day that she and the other guy were supposedly having an affair. (I don't know, nor do I want to). So my wife has a nightmare of me being u faithful so to make herself feel better the goes through my call logs, text logs, and search history. Which when I discovered this I was upset and did have an argument where I was the AH.  She finds the 1 and only phone call she and I have ever had and is upset with me for not mentioning it, she claims I'm sneaking around and that because of my coworkers indiscretion it automatically makes me guilty. I've maintained I haven't done anything wrong outside of not mentioning that she had called me.   

Some notes: she and her husband work here and we are friends.

I told her to be careful but to wake up her husband and tell him and call the cops.  That was the gist of a 61 minute conversation and that's pretty much what was repeated.  Comes out the next day that she and the other guy were supposedly having an affair. (I don't know, nor do I want to). So my wife has a nightmare of me being u faithful so to make herself feel better the goes through my call logs, text logs, and search history. Which when I discovered this I was upset and did have an argument where I was the AH.  She finds the 1 and only phone call she and I have ever had and is upset with me for not mentioning it, she claims I'm sneaking around and that because of my coworkers indiscretion it automatically makes me guilty. I've maintained I haven't done anything wrong outside of not mentioning that she had called me.   

Some notes: she and her husband work here and we are friends.

My wife has asked that I not have conversations with her before (or any woman really) when she noticed that we had text messaged each other. Nothing inappropriate 

After she asked I have stop text outside or work related matters. AITA?",1.0,0.9691033959388733,1,1
46,1dtse65,AITA for assuming my sister's make up brush used to be mine?,"So my sister Cate (30f) just stormed off to a weekly dancing class, and I (34f) am left to wonder what on earth just happened. I'd like some insight before she gets back. We live in the  
same apartment. 

Long story short, Cate walked into the living room, happy with her freshly rinsed make up brush. I thought I recognized it as a brush that used to be mine, but I haven't seen it or used in years. Using each other's stuff happens a lot.  Usually when we can't find something, the other is the first person we ask. Same goes for when one of us likes something that the other isn't really using anymore. Stuff changes hands a lot around here. So, when Cate showed me the brush, I noted it used to be mine.

She absolutely lost her shit, guys. Asked between clenched jaws if I could please stop accusing her of stealing my stuff, and it just escalated and escalated. I tried to explain that I wasn't accusing her of anything - for all I know I gave her that brush years ago - and even if she did just take it, I didn't mind and didn't miss it. It was just an observation. Not to mention, with how much we use each other's stuff, it's not weird to assume that she ends up with something of mine, so I'd stop remarking about it as soon as she stops using my stuff.

She immediately stomped off to the bathroom to remove all her stuff from there, and into the kitchen to split up all our cutlery like some toddler throwing a tantrum, until I asked her repeatedly to stop it.

Before she left, I asked her to check with me if she assumes I'm accusing her of theft, because that wasn't what I was doing. I just thought I recognized something that was mine years ago. She then goes on to say that my accusation was *implied* even though I didn't outright say it.

I'm just absolutely floored. How am I supposed to take responsibility for what she read into my observation? Imo, her interpretation is not my responsibility, and I don't want to go around worrying about things I'm *not* saying. I feel like agreeing to something like that would just allow her to dictate what I do or don't mean, regardless of what I actually say and how I intend it.

So, guys, AITA? And even if I'm not, how can I go about resolving this?

Edit: a few have pointed out that it was weird for me to assume it was my make up brush to begin with.

Basically, eggs, fruit, bottled drinks, frozen stuff, etc. Maybe $100 total.

**The organizer of the trip (let's call him S) bought everything and the plan was for everyone to pay 1/5 of what he got from the store. Now, he wants us to split everything that was shared, but wants anyone who took something home to pay for that separately and I refused. None of this was discussed beforehand, we just assumed we'd split the costs 5-ways since that's what we've done in the past.**

I was the last one to leave and took what was left so it wouldn't go to waste. We didn't discuss it beyond: ""Anyone want these things?""

I assumed we would split the cost of everything 5 ways. 

S started by asking me what I took home from the trip in detail, then I asked him why he was asking, he said it was for accounting purposes since another friend (let's call him A) offered to pay for a few things he took home.

It's really not a lot of money, but I'm annoyed at the request, since it wasn't discussed beforehand and my only intention was to use the food instead of throwing it away.

Sidenote: I don't know if this is of consequence or not, but also on the trip I accidentally broke the host's blender (cost \~$80). I offered to pay for it, but friend A insisted we split it. I also got everyone a round of drinks (\~$60) one night out.

I don't mind being a little generous here and there, but I told him it's one thing for someone to make an offer like that, it's something else entirely to *ask* them for money.

My younger sister (I’ll call her Cece) is going to college in another state for uni and is currently a sophomore. She got accepted into a university with a really good art program, but couldn’t afford to dorm and pay for her school’s tuition with her loan and savings. So my husband and I bought her a decent  apartment (paid for in full) in a good area so she can commute to school. It’s technically under our name, but we let her treat it as her own, so she can feel independent

We pay for everything- including the utilities (even wifi), so she lives there rent free and is able to save her money she makes from working part time and focus on school. 

But the other day I found out that she’s not even living in the apartment and is instead living with her boyfriend! She apparently has been for the past school year and just didn’t tell anyone- and is renting out the apartment for cheap to one of her friends (AND WE HAVE BEEN BASICALLY PAYING FOR A STRANGER TO LIVE THERE)?!

I only found out after a package I ordered for her got returned to me (it was a wellness package with some snacks and stuff, usually I Amazon things over but I actually packed this one myself so I had to send it with UPS, and this one was returned). 

Cece’s justification for this is that she “needs the money” for the graduation trip she’s saving up for- which is literally in years so i don’t know why it’s such a big deal yet? But my husband and I don’t want to be paying for her friend to live there while she lives for free with her boyfriend anyways.

I don’t want to kick Cece’s friend out as she’s an innocent party and leave her stranded, but maybe if I take her on as a renter we can work this out separately

Would I be the asshole if I cut Cece off financially?

Edit: Just to clarify, I feel like doing so might make me the asshole because she’s my little sister, and without my help she wouldn’t have a safety net to fall back on (especially if her and her boyfriend broke up).

This has been the plan for nearly a year now.

My GF (F21) of 5 months is very uncomfortable with me living with a woman, specifically Friend 2s GF, to the point of rage. They’ve met twice, we all watched a movie, and then again during a day/road trip. My GF feels Friend 2s GF is a pick-me and says that's why she doesn't like her. She says she doesn't like pick-mes because her best friend is one and puts her down in front of mutual friends to make herself look better. She also says ""she doesn't know/trust her, and will never want to"". If Friend 1 had a GF and they swapped roles with Friend 2, this wouldn't be as big of an issue.

She doesn't want us getting closer or friendly with each other, which I understand but the absolute fury during arguments about this persists even after I agree with her. She’s concerned about ""The little moments"" living together, potentially cooking together, seeing her in pajamas, etc. Explicitly, she outlined doing anything with just us 2, watching movies, cooking together, driving her anywhere is all considered cheating in her eyes (duh, why would I do that when she has a car and a boyfriend she can ask?). I said I won’t do any of that to help her stay comfortable and because if we swapped roles I'd be uncomfortable with her doing the same.

My GF says she won’t come to my place because she doesn't want to see her. Even ME spending too much time there will be an issue. Why? My GF’s last BF cheated. I've been cognizant of this, making sure she has no doubts about my faithfulness. She’s convinced that I will cheat on her with my brother's future wife. IDK how to convince her I won’t with words.

I instantly felt ill as the messaged felt like as if i was in the wrong,I kept looking and found the message ""Yknow what I ain't inviting her to the sleepover"" this confirmed my fears that they didn't want me there.I tried to leave after but W didn't want me to leave yet, I began to cry and tell her everything to why I was distancing myself and what was going on with my Mental health. I mentioned how not getting invited to the sleepover caused some distress and I felt they hated me and W said it was because T wouldn't of been able to  get home after the party and it was too short notice to ask me if I wanted to go, but obviously after seeing the messages I knew this wasn't true.I made sure to tell T what I told W and she sent me a paragraph defending themselves and saying that they did distance themselves from me because I distanced myself from them but they should have invited me to the sleepover, T then said the same lie as W, which they had discussed previously in the messages incase I asked about the sleepover and why they didn't tell me about it. T said she apologises for how they made me feel but I'm still unsettled knowing they're still lying to me, I feel my trust for them has deteriorated. I wanted to message W saying ""If you purposefully didn't invite me to the sleepover I'd rather you admit it, I wouldn't be mad but I have a gut feeling that some truth still isn't being told"" but then she'd know I looked at her messages.

53,1dtro78,AITA for refusing to help my brother with his classes?,"My (17F) brother (20M) has dyscalculia and dysgraphia. 

He's currently in college as a business major, and while he's home for the summer he has to take a computer science class for his degree.
My freshman year of high school, I took an AP Computer Science class and got a 3 on the exam, but I've since forgotten most of what I learned. 
Right before his class started, he told me he would pay me to take the class for him. I told him no because I was already busy and couldn't commit to something like that. I told him I'd be willing to help, because I know stuff like that is hard for him.
The first few assignments I practically did for him. I'd ask him what he was confused about, and he would say ""everything."" I honestly don't think he even looked at the assignments. 

I told him he needed to get started, and I'd look it over after. 

He ended up putting the assignment prompt in ChatGPT, but because he made no effort to actually learn the material, he had no clue how to debug any of it. I ended up basically having to rewrite the entire program because ChatGPT would program things in ways that he wasn't supposed to know how to do yet. 

After a few weeks of this, I told him I wasn't going to help him if he wasn't even going to try doing the assignments himself. I told him that using ChatGPT was only making things harder for me to debug, but he didn't care.

I told him that he would just have to do the rest of the course by himself. He got upset, talking about how because of his dyscalculia/dysgraphia he isn't able to do these sorts of things. I'm sympathetic, and I'm willing to help, but I have no interest in doing the entire class for him when he won't even try.

He told our parents about this, and they also got upset, calling me selfish. They said I'm essentially sabotaging my brother's future.

My dad and Monica ended up not paying and we withdrew the date to pay too long so I didn’t go.  

Now, Monica had set up a trip to Italy with her friends and they would pay for it as a gift for my 18th birthday next year.

57,1dtr9ju,AITA for not adhering to my (23F) boyfriend's (25M) house rules,"My (23F) Boyfriend (25M) is a clean freak (?) and he is always making fun of me or yelling at me.

Me and boyfriend started living together this month and I am having so many problems about his cleanliness.

I am generally a clean person but I do not make a habit of obsessing over it. Usually, I am the one cleaning the bathroom, the toilet seats etc. or the floors and the carpet. I do these a few days a week. I also unload the dishwasher and load it back up and do the laundry (clean, hang, fold).

However, my boyfriend wants the place to be spotless all the time, even when we are living in it. The biggest problem seems to be the kitchen. I cook a few times a day and I usually give the counters a wipe before sitting down to eat so I do not set him off. However, I like to relax a bit too, and I do not want to deep clean the kitchen when I know I will be using it. He has meal prep, so he never really uses the kitchen. But when he eats his meal prep, I usually put his dishes in for him or wipe off his mess if he needs to leave. I end up deep cleaning the kitchen spotless before I go to sleep everynight.

He also always complains about my hair. We just got a new puppy and the puppy loves chewing on my hair, and of course, it pulls off some of my hair. Usually I vaccuum everyday but b/c the puppy is scared, I do it a few times a week now. I try to explain this to him, but he does not stop making fun of me about my dirtiness.

I tried to reason with him a few times and he admits that he is problematic about this but does not want to change. This is his apartment, and even though for 2 years I was the one financially supporting him (payed for his food and necessities when he was in a bad spot) I feel unwelcomed and feel like I do not belong here. 

What can I do in this situation? Am I the asshole for not adhering to his rules, or is he being unfair?

Mango has a crush on a boy; Pineapple; she's liked him for a long time, and although it's the summer currently, she still likes him. She says she's starting to lose interest in him, but I'm not really sure because she's liked him since October 2023. One day, she asks me to text Pineapple on Tiktok because she wants to know what he thinks about her. I ask him and he says that she's a smart friend, but can be annoying sometimes.

I tell her and immediately I can tell she gets upset by the last part he included. Even though it's obvious she's upset, she just says ""Oh ok"" because she usually hides her feelings when stuff like this happens to her. I honestly feel bad for her and she asks me to text him more because when she texts him, he leaves her on seen or delivered. I decide to get his discord and Roblox (I would also like to include that I don't like him and I have never liked him I only did this because she asked me to and for me to see how he really was) and I play Roblox with him; he's nice I guess; just the average high school dude.

Another day, she tells me to ask him what he thinks his GPA will be (because they didn't get report cards yet). I text him and immediately he asks me ""Did (Mango) ask you to ask me that?"" and I get kinda scared and shocked; because I'm like, how do you know? He then shows me a screenshot that she already asked him on Tiktok and he just left her on seen so that's probably why she asked me to do it.

I tell him I understand but I don't tell Mango because I know she's gonna get upset and I'm scared that she might ask him if he really said that and I have enough ops already.

60,1dtqyb3,AITA for disturbing my downstairs neighbor?,"My boyfriend (21) and I (21F) just moved into an apartment together. We have two cats around the age of one. Our downstairs neighbor complained about us being too loud at night to the front office. I explained to the front office that the cats tend to be playful with each other and that was likely the noise my neighbor was hearing. We have hardwood floors, so the woman at the front office suggested we buy a rug to muffle the sound of the cats running around or wrestling with each other. We got a rug that takes up almost our entire living room that same day. We also decided to have the cats stay in my boyfriend and I’s bedroom at night, so we could make sure they weren’t being too loud and the carpet in the bedroom would muffle the sound of them moving around better. 

A week later we got a call about another complaint. I explained to the office the steps we’d taken to help with the problem, and they thanked us for doing what we could and said there wouldn’t be any repercussions because we were trying. That night, at 1AM, our downstairs neighbor knocked on our door to complain to us directly. My boyfriend was at his desk watching something with headphones on. I was in bed, and the cats were both asleep at the foot of the bed. We had no idea what the neighbor was hearing, and my boyfriend told her as much. He explained to her the steps we’d taken to try and stop the noise. She said she’d had no idea we had cats, and that it wasn’t fair for us to lock them up at night. She apologized and left. My boyfriend thought maybe his desk chair was making noise when he moved, so he switched it out for one of our dining room chairs. We stopped locking the cats up at night because she’d said so. 

Another week goes by and around midnight to 1AM, she showed up complaining again. My boyfriend apologized and asked if she wanted us to lock the cats up again, but she said that wouldn’t help because there were people in both of her bedrooms too. He told her he wasn’t sure what else she wanted us to do, and she left in a huff. We tried locking the cats up in crates, and they absolutely hated it, so we gave that up. We tried separating them in different rooms at night, but they’d paw at the door and one of them ended up pooping in our room, so we stopped that too.

Next time she shows up, it’s because the TV was too loud. It was 10PM, and I was the only one home. I was watching a movie, and I didn’t think it was loud at all. But I apologized and offered to turn it down. I mentioned to her that people had just moved in above us, and they were pretty loud too. I think it’s just the way the floors are built. She agreed and made a comment about how all apartments are paper thin. If she knows that, I don’t under why she’s complaining, but I digress.

She won't even let mom stay for a few days so one of us could pick her up.

I drove 7 hours to pick mom up and she stayed with me for two months until her home was good. The family was pissed at my sister and it resulted in a discussion about how she never helps anyone out. Everyone has experience it at some point where she didn't care enough to help out. My biggest example that pertains to me is when my car broke down and my sister refused to pick me up so I had to walk home and hitch a ride home ( this was before Uber took off). I got home and she was on phone deadscrolling. Everyone in the family has examples.

We all decided to not help my sister anymore. This is the issue now, she needs a place to stay since she is moving to a new city and her lease on her home ended. So about a month to stay with someone beofre she can move into her new apartment in the city. Everyone has turned her down.

She called me and asked if she could stay with me. I told her no and she started crying why the family won't help her out. I told her that their are consequences to not helping out our mom when she needed it.

62,1dtq6ll,AITA for refusing a luxury purse from my MIL,"I (27f) refurbish purses, both luxury and sentimental, as a lucrative side hustle. Sometimes I’ll also go to thrift stores and see if I can find purses that people have discarded and either sell them or give them as gifts. About 6 months ago, I found a black Latico Leathers tote that was in great condition and decided to keep it for myself. I have a pretty maximalist aesthetic so I make it my own by tying various scarves and beads around the handle periodically. I love this bag and I love it even more than it only cost me $8. 

My husband (28m) and I eat dinner at my MIL’s house quite often and she is the originator of the clean girl aesthetic. Everything in her house is very white and minimal. Her style is also this way and she only wears neutrals. I say this because when I first came over with my new bag, she had said how loud it was. 

From then on, every time we went over to her house she always made some sort of, “you still carrying that thing around everywhere?” comment. It got to the point that I just started leaving it in the car. 

A month ago, though, we all went out to a nicer restaurant and I brought my bag in, to which my MIL scoffed and said, “Please leave that ugly thing in the car. It’s so embarrassing.” This struck a nerve and we had a little tiff over it, to which it ended with her making a comment that she was going to buy me another bag so she didn’t have to look at mine anymore. In the moment, I didn’t take her seriously and I honestly forgot the whole comment entirely. 

Last week, we went over for dinner at her house when she met us at the door with a huge smile. She grabbed my arm and rushed me to the other room and told me she had something to show me. There was a Kate Spade Perfect Large Tote in a yellow/beige color. “Put it on!” she said. “Don’t you love it?” That’s when I realized that she had bought this for me and I said, “I really appreciate the gesture, but if you’re going to get me a bag, it would be nice to go shopping together so that I can get something that is more my style.”

She told me that it was final sale and when I told her that she should keep it for herself, she blew up and started calling me ungrateful. I told her I wasn’t going to take something that I wouldn’t use, let alone didn’t like and she started crying. My husband and I left and he told me I should have just taken the bag and used it when we went out with her. For me, something expensive like that should be used by someone who really likes it and it’s obvious she bought it to project herself onto me.

63,1dtq5db,AITA for telling my husband to stop leaving his comfort sword on my seat?,"Yes, I know how it sounds, but there's no other way of saying it.

I (34 F) have been married to Husband (32 M) for about two years, together for five. Husband has serious anxiety. He's on medication for it, and it works great. He went from having three panic attacks a month to having one every three months. Getting on medication was his idea, and I fully supported it. But it's not a miracle cure, and he still very much has anxiety.

I have to travel out of town for work every now and then, usually just for a night or two. We have a sofa in our living room where we sit together and watch TV/cuddle before bed. Every time I leave for a work trip and come home, I sit down in my spot only to yelp and leap up. Husband has one of those wooden kendo swords (because we're nerds, not because we're accomplished swordsmen), and apparently when I'm gone, he keeps it next to him.

I asked him why, and he said it's for protection. He gets scared when he's home alone, thinking that someone is going to break in. He knows it's unlikely and also that a wooden sword won't really do much against a serious home invader, but it makes him feel better, and you can't reason with anxiety.

I said, ""That's totally fine, I get it, but do you need it during the day or just at night?"" He said just at night. I then pointed out that all he has to do is put it back before I get home. Husband's counterargument is that he has very severe ADHD (he does; this is a fact), so he forgets all about the sword as soon as the ""danger"" has passed. Also, I only go out of town maybe 4 nights a year, so it's not like this is a constant problem. I said that's true but also, since I don't stay away from home very often, I forget every time to check for the sword before sitting down. And he could just prop it against the sofa instead of putting it on my seat. It's not sharp--it's not going to cut through anything. There are a million solutions here that don't involve me sitting on a random sword.

But thanks to ADHD, it is legitimately more difficult for Husband to remember things than it is for me, so maybe I should just make a note to myself and call it a day. It really does make him feel better.

But she came to me recently upset saying that since I’m into fashion and putting together different lewks and hairdos she feels like I should have told her, her style was blah and gave her suggestions, but my thought is why should I, she seemed perfectly happy with her style and I don’t feel like I have any room to tell someone my unrequested opnion on their style, what if it hurt her feelings at the time, I would feel so bad.

A bit of background I 37(m) divorced my ex wife 51(f) back in 2020 for various reasons. Ultimately it boils down to a very toxic relationship that I rather not got into. She has two kids from a prior marriage that are adults now (23m and 20f) and we have one child together (9(m)) that’s no longer in her custody due to legal reasons. In order to speed up the divorce I pretty much gave her everything, the house, the cars, the bank accounts, everything we owned together just to get away from her. I do pay child support for my child but it does not go to her because she does not have custody.


After the divorce we came up with an agreement that she would let me borrow one of the cars until I can rebuild my life and get my own car and I would give her some money each month for the car and pay for whatever maintenance the car required.  after years of clawing my way out of a hole with some major setbacks I was finally able to get my own car. I gave her car back before the next payment was due.
 

Here is where I might be the AH. My ex messaged me today asking if I still planned to send her the money this month. I flat out told her no, our arrangement as concluded and I see no reason to keep giving her money for a car I am no longer using. She later complained she needs that money to pay bills and whatnot which I am pretty sure is not true since she has a job that pays better than mine and she has a BF that lives with her now that can pay his share of the bills.

66,1dtpqt4,AITA for telling my dad I'm not a toy he can take out when he needs me and discard once I've served my purpose?,"I'm (22m) a twin and I have a twin sister Wren. When Wren and I were 4 our mom died from liver cancer. She was 30. I know that would be difficult for dad. Going from a happily married father of two to a widowered father of two with no family close enough (emotionally) for support would be a lot. But he was a better dad to my sister than to me and that started before mom died. It just stood out more after.

My dad was an affectionate and caring father to Wren. She was his little girl and her cherished her. If she fell he would pick her up, kiss her tears and clean her cuts. He was gentle and compassionate with her. When she was upset she could sleep in bed with him. He'd snuggle with her on the couch. He'd pull her out of school sometimes and take her for father-daughter dates. When she was bullied, he was riding the school hard to deal with it and he fought so hard for her. He went out of his way to make sure she was loved and supported.

Growing up I heard the words tough and strong a lot. I heard the word man a lot and I was still so young. He never cuddled me or kissed away my tears or carried me. He never even said I love you to me. There was nothing gentle about him when it came to me. He was rougher, harsher, he expected me to be tough, to be a man, to be strong. If I had a nightmare I was sent right back to bed. When I got bullied *horrifically* in high school my dad didn't want to know. There were times Wren and I would both fall. We'd both be young too. And even if I was bleeding more, she was the kid he comforted. It was never me. Not if it was both of us falling and not if it was just me. He never did father-son dates. The most interest he ever showed in me was when I could help him do guy chores, like moving stuff.

I tried to approach this with him on a few different occasions but I never got to finish. He always cut me off for one reason or another. It got to a point where I expected it if I tried. I moved in with my best friends family after I finished high school (at home). Wren lived at home for two more years. Dad only called me when he wanted something.

He did it again the other day and I decided this shit had to end. I told him I'm not a toy he can take out when he needs me and then discard me once I've served my purpose. I told him I'm his son, not his helper. And I brought up how he never says he misses me, or says I love you, he never ever showed me love or affection and I wasn't going to tolerate it anymore. Dad sent me an email in response (he emails better than he texts) saying I was being very harsh. He said I was never his little girl and boys are raised different. I replied I was never trying to be his little girl but *I was* his little boy and he should have shown me love too. He responded again that I accused him of discarding me like a possession which was unjustified.

69,1dtpdb7,AITA for denying my ex's request to see my dog,"I dated my ex bf for 10 years on and off. We lived together during the last 4 years, and in that time we got a dog. I purchased the dog, legally her paperwork is in my name, and I paid for 99% of the expenses related to her: vet, food, toys, bed, etc. This relationship was never healthy, but became increasingly more toxic, especially after living together. When the dog behaved well, she was his dog. When she was not behaving, she was my dog that he never wanted. 

During the breakup that he initiated, he refused to see the dog. He forced me to pay him hundreds of dollars in bogus ""damages"" (blocked me from leaving a room in the house until I wrote him a check), and then he bought hundreds of dollars in dog treats and toys that he gave back to me with a sappy note about how much he loved her. Yet, in the days leading up to me moving out, he said he didn't want to see or hear her, so I kept her (and myself) locked in the basement bedroom.

I left in Nov. of 2022. He has attempted to see me and my dog numerous times. I have ignored him, blocked him, denied him. He has continued to reach out specifically around holidays which seems intentional, creating new emails to contact me.

He has come to the town we now live in (which is 3 hours from him) numerous times. Once even leaving a box filled with stuff I left at the house at a local park and writing my name and phone number inside it. 

I can imagine how hard it would be to lose a dog. I would be devastated. But I don't feel like I owe this man anything, and based on how he treated me and my dog, I don't feel like seeing him would benefit either of us.

72,1dtp62y,AITA for contacting an old colleague about abuse I experienced from a former shared client?,"Two years ago, I worked as an independent contractor for a client alongside a woman who ran her own company with her husband. I was the only solo female contractor. This client treated me abusively: avoiding eye contact, deleting my emails, ostracizing me from group activities, removing my responsibilities without explanation, talking about my gender in derogatory ways to other independent contractors, and sexually harassing me. Despite no feedback and poor treatment, my results exceeded our targets. One day, he simply deleted my email, effectively ending our working relationship (which is illegal).

This experience led to deep depression, causing me to leave the industry. After two years, I felt ready to confide in someone. I chose “A,” a woman who owns a company advocating for women in tech and music. We met years ago through my nonprofit that supported women, so I felt a personal connection. Her platform promotes a safe space for women to share their experiences and supports neurodiversity.

I privately messaged “A” about my abusive experience with the client, expressing my disappointment over the end of our working relationship. She responded, claiming she was unaware but had immediately told the client what I said. This breach of trust shocked me.

So my friend group is pretty much just my church friends. I'm very close with a few of them, and some others I just kinda deal with because they're in it. Early on in high school I was kindve the punching bag for jokes and other things with the group, mostly with the people I didn't care for as much. I really wanted friends though, and they were kindve all I had, so I dealt with it. It's eased up a bit in the last 2 years or so, but there's still a few jokes that still come up and make me upset. I don't think I've got thin skin, but they're just irritating. 

This leads to this girl the year below me at church who I've been crushing on for a while. We've talked and I consider her a friend. Unfortunately she's also pretty close with the ringleader for these jokes in my friend group, and seemingly through his influence is aware of the jokes. She doesn't partake but knows of their existence and all that. She tells me her and her best friend are doing this brief part at our graduation ceremony, like giving out superlatives for the graduating class.

74,1dtp1u3,AITA for showing up to a social gathering with pizza?,"This was years ago, sometime in 2015. My shift at Domino's was ending and my boss told me I could take home an extra two pizzas we had sitting around from canceled orders. After work, I was planning on going to a friend's house for a weekly get together where we would watch anime and play video games. Showing up to a get together with pizza seemed like an obvious pairing. I remembered that one line from Daria, think it went ""There is no situation that isn't improved with a slice of pizza."" Plus they would have likely gone into the garbage if I didn't take them.  
  
So I show up with the pizza and the first thing I'm told by my friend who was hosting is that ""Nobody asked you to bring pizza."", with an aggravated expression on his face. Didn't even say hi to me. Then people start taking slices, without even so much as a thank you. Night goes on and we watch anime like usual. I didn't make fuss at the time, likely because I was afraid of starting a conflict and getting exiled from the friend group. At the time of this post, I haven't talked to any of these people in over four years.

Am I missing something? Is showing up to a social gathering with food unannounced rude? I could maybe understand if dinner was already served, but people literally took slices and ate them, so It couldn't have been that people's tummies were too full. This has been bothering me for awhile now.

75,1dtont0,AITA for asking my band to reschedule a gig?,"
I (19M) am currently the bassist in a band over the summer for college. We played a lot of gigs our last couple years of high school together, and played once over winter break when we were all back. I wasn’t sure if we were going to play very many gigs this summer, but discussed with our singer (19F) and rhythm guitarist (18M), who both wanted to play, and they talked to our drummer (18M) and lead guitarist (19M), and we all decided we would play a few gigs. One day last week, our singer and rhythm guitarist went out asking around to find places we could play. They found one, and our singer spent a few days talking back and forth finding a day. I agreed to a day a month and a half away. The day after the gig was confirmed, I found out I was going on a family trip to visit my grandma that weekend and celebrate her birthday. I had known we were going to visit her, but my aunt who is scheduling it changed the date. I told my band this the day after the gig was confirmed, and my singer and rythym guitarist who were primarily involved in scheduling got annoyed at me, said they didn’t believe me, told me it was my fault that I didn’t let them know earlier, when I literally couldn’t have, and said that they were going to play the gig without me. The lead guitarist agreed, and the drummer didn’t say anything. After a back and forth, I started to get upset, and was asking the lead singer and rhythm guitarist why they were being so rude. They denied it and said that I was the one that was rude and disrespectful for not appreciating the time put into scheduling. I said I did appreciate it, but was upset and confused as to why they didn’t want to even try and reschedule with so much time in advance.
I also offered to contact the place we were playing myself and try and get it rescheduled if they didn’t want to. The conversation near the end got pretty heated. With me saying they were both being POS and them saying I’m an a-hole and bad person. A few hours later I talked to the rhythm guitarist on the phone, and I was trying to get him to understand my situation, and he didn’t care. Additionally he said that neither he nor the singer were being mean, that I was blowing things out of proportion by calling him about it, and that things were already decided.

He said that I need to apologize and that she is warranted in how she had been treating me because of the grudge. AITA?

76,1dtoiqh,AITA for ordering before a woman who was still shopping,"We are in a fancy hotel. It was a splurge. I'm a little out of my element, but trying to have an experience with my 3 kids. 1 prek, 1 toddler and 1 special needs. We went to the little coffee shop/store for breakfast. There were 2 people in line. One woman was ordering. Behind her was a woman and her daughter. Just as I joined the line the woman told her daughter not to move from the line and walked to the fridges about 20 ft away. 

I was in a great mood. I had noticed that the woman who walked away had on a beautiful dress. If she hadn't left I would have complimented her dress. 

I did have the 3 kids who were pretty excited about the selection of snacks available at the counter, none of which I intended to purchase. 

The first woman completed her order and the daughter of the woman with the pretty dress was now first in line. She looked uncomfortable. We waited maybe 20 seconds. The cashier began to shift around, the kids were restless. We waited maybe another 20 seconds before I kind of started to move up (the daughter had kind of shifted to the side and had tried several times to get her mom's attention).

There were 2 people in line. One woman was ordering. Behind her was a woman and her daughter.

I was in a great mood. I had noticed that the woman who walked away had on a beautiful dress. If she hadn't left I would have complimented her dress. 

I did have the 3 kids who were pretty excited about the selection of snacks available at the counter, none of which I intended to purchase.

I have 1 teenage daughter and she has 2 teenage boys. We have been going slow with being around and introducing children into our relationship but have started to. My hesitation is that I’ve had one relationship outside of my daughter’s mother and I don’t want to introduce too many different ladies in her life to think changing partners often is okay. She has been reluctant as she is about to finalise financial separation and didn’t want extra hassle with her ex if he knew she was dating. Totally separate situations, no affairs or anything. 

This week I’m on school holidays with my daughter and am taking her and a friend of hers to a larger city 2 hours for school holiday fun eg theme parks, and staying with my father, so not partying or anything except this will be the first time I see my father and sister since my 50th birthday last week. 

She tells me I’m being an AH for going away and not spending time with her on my holiday, even though we are only slowly building up our relationship around our kids

I knew this wasn't the original plan for how things would go, and essentially if I said nothing, they would work and it wouldn't be a huge issue to management, they would probably be ok with it, but if I mentioned it to management they would say its not necessary and reiterate to the coworker that they should only be flying home that day.


Something about the way that my coworker seriously couldn't give me a single reason, not even a weak one, for what they'd actually be doing that day just really grated me, and I ended up mentioning it to management who reiterated that no time should be worked on that day by them.

80,1dto33i,AITA for reacting like this to a prank?,"So, about a few months ago in High School, I had this classmate who everyone would ship me with.

I will call her ""Carol"" from now on.

I think that ships are just stupid to do in general and should only be reserved for fictional characters, not real people.

Carol was also a bit of a jerk as she always picked on me in class.

I always shrugged it off, but this one time really struck a nerve.

There's this bar which I always go to before (and after) school as it's about <100 meters away from it.

I went there, drank a coffee and was heading out when I saw her and a bunch of ther classmates. (who were also jerks like her)

They go ""Yo, (OP), Carol wants to tell you something.""

I tell them ""Yeah? What's up?"", and Carol goes ""I want to be your girlfriend!"", as she and the others kept giggling and/or laughing.

Of course, because I'm not an idiot, I immediatly understood that it was a prank, and told them ""April 1st was a few weeks ago"" and walked away.

I was VERY close to telling them to fuck off, but I didn't because it's not my style and I didn't want to give them any kind of reaction.

I never texted Carol, I never asked Carol out(or vice versa), and this totally hit my limit.

Never talked to Carol ever again after this, along with the other classmates who were with her at the time.

This type of prank(In my opinion) is absolute shit and nobody should organize one or be the victim of one.

I asked others what they tought of my response and they said that I was ""Too harsh"" or that ""They were just having fun"".

To me, that is complete bull, but I will ask all of you for an answer.

81,1dtnz2c,WIBTA if I didn’t tell my neighbors I took their kitten.,"I (19 F) have neighbors (family of 6) that brought a cat when they moved in years ago. Since then the cat had reproduced and her kittens reproduced multiple times since they don’t take their cats and get them fixed. Recently one of the cats that came from their original cat gave birth to another two kittens. I had gone out one day because the neighbor girl (probably about 10) pointed out that the kittens were born and I picked one up and instantly fell in love.

The neighbor girl specifically said I couldn’t have that kitten, even though there were two she didn’t want me having that one. She’s done this before with cats that me or my siblings wanted. The thing is that they keep their cats outside and we live along a highway where the cats always get hit, and when that doesn’t happen they do tend to just disappear since there is also a field behind us. I also know that the neighbor on the other side of me hates that theres always stray cats on his property.

Now, the other day my younger brother told me to come outside because the kittens were out from under the neighbors shed and in our yard. We spent probably 30 minutes trying to catch one and finally were able to catch the one that I happened to like. I took her inside, gave her a bath, and have been taking care of her for the past few days, even named her.

Technically, I still live under my mother’s roof and she did specifically say she didn’t want me to have this kitten over a month ago since I already have a cat. I know I’ll be able to foster her to a friend if I have to until I’m able to move out. The other thing is that my younger sister said that the neighbors were planning on taking one of the kittens in, but they didn’t do that in the years that they lived next door so I’m not sure if they’re actually planning on it.

I love this kitten so much and I don’t want to ask them if I can keep her since I know the little girl really wants the one I have even if it means still keeping her outside. And I know that if the cat outside has more kittens she’ll like those ones too.

I (22F) am considered the ""smart"" one of the group, mostly because I know how to mess with computers and I'm not afraid to look up stuff I don't know how to do and figure it out. I've been like this since I was a kid, and in my friend group, I'm the one to figure out game modding, pirating, and any computer related issue we encounter. I won't be modest and say I don't know much, I do, but all I know came from google.

I don't mind helping my friends (18\~21, varied genders) with anything, I actually enjoy it.

They frequently call me a nerd and the like for that, but it doesn't upset me.

A few nights ago, we were planning to play a game that is modded through a very user friendly launcher, we have a stablished modpack for a while now, but one of our friends (19M) is new to the group, so he needed help modding his game. I was planning on participating, but by 10 (we were to play around 11:30) I could barely keep myself awake, so I told my closest friend I was going to bed for the night, and apologized from not joining them.

Next day I woke up to a few messages on our server with them pinging me and asking for help to teach our new friend how to install the modpack, and that they ended up just playing the game without mods since I wasn't around. It made me a bit upset, since they were pretty much blaming me for not being there. 

I admit I was a bit rude, but I told them I was sorry I was exhausted from work, and that a simple google search would have answered their questions. I didn't call them names or anything. For reference, installing a modpack on this launcher is a matter of selecting the game, clicking on an Import button, and pasting a code I had left pinned on our chat.

They were all very upset at me and I expressed that sometimes it feels like they rely on me too much for help, and that I don't like feeling guilty over sleeping instead of being awake to help.

I live in a tiny Iñupiat town, and because I work remotely and live on the same property as my entire family, I sometimes like to go for drives around town to reset my brain.

The other day, I was returning home from one of my drives, when I saw a small crowd of people on the side of the road. I saw my Grandma Mary (Grammary)’s car parked near the scene, so I started to roll to a stop to make sure she was okay. She was fine, but she was tending to one of the teenagers who lived on the nearby rez. He had fallen off his bike and he looked a bit dazed.

Grammary is a nurse practitioner, and she has treated men who have been disemboweled by bears without a sweat, so I was sure she had it under control. Still, I rolled down my window and asked if she had everything she needed for the situation. She nodded and waved for me to move along. There were about 15 people there already, and I’m sure she had enough to worry about, so I didn’t hesitate to obey.

After this, I went to my moms’ house to help them with work. I was in one of the offices, when I heard the door of the parlor open and a male voice. I assumed it was one of the new security guards my PawPaw hired until I began to hear my name. I stepped into the lobby and saw the uncle of the kid who was injured—I’ll call him Jay. He was pointing a finger at my mother, Aga.  As soon as he saw me, he shook his head and looked me up and told me I was a stuck-up bitch.

I could tell Aga was ready to pummel the dude, so I quickly asked if everything was okay. I’m sure he was scared for his nephew, so I didn’t want to write him off.

Jay told me that I was a monster, because I just “rolled right by” a kid in need. I asked him what I should have done. Grammary was there and she had plenty of help. He didn’t give me an answer. He just said that I was the only person who didn’t stop and called me racist. I’m half-Iñupiat and half-white, so I’m seen as “less than” by the entire town. So, this was rich.

Aga quickly stepped in and told Jay to leave.

My family has been telling me not to worry about it. Grammary came over after her work was done and she seemed to be aware of Jay’s sentiments before we told her about everything, but she didn’t elaborate. She just rolled her eyes and assured me that she would have forced me to get back in the car if I did try to help. There were “too many chiefs” as it was. I guess I should feel better, but I still feel guilty. Should I have stopped?

I live in a tiny Iñupiat town, and because I work remotely and live on the same property as my entire family, I sometimes like to go for drives around town to reset my brain.

The other day, I was returning home from one of my drives, when I saw a small crowd of people on the side of the road. I saw my Grandma Mary (Grammary)’s car parked near the scene, so I started to roll to a stop to make sure she was okay. She was fine, but she was tending to one of the teenagers who lived on the nearby rez. He had fallen off his bike and he looked a bit dazed.

Grammary is a nurse practitioner, and she has treated men who have been disemboweled by bears without a sweat, so I was sure she had it under control. Still, I rolled down my window and asked if she had everything she needed for the situation. She nodded and waved for me to move along.

85,1dtnbms,AITA for getting a lock installed on my bedroom door?,"I (19F) am home from college for the summer. This post concerns me and my dad (54M).

For as long as I can remember, my dad has been barging into my room without asking or knocking multiple times a day (and sometimes at night, since I’m a night owl and awake well into the early morning)—whether it’s to show me something, ask me to come down and hang out with him, to check on me, or even just to say hi. Which was totally fine when I was a child, but obviously became more of an issue as I aged.

It continued all throughout my teenage years. He’d come in without permission, I’d beg him to start knocking since I could be changing; dealing with my period; etc., he’d apologize and commit to not doing it again, and then within days he’d do it again. I even taped signs to my door to try to deter it. Nothing worked, and eventually I just gave up since I’d be going to college soon anyway.

Fast forward to now, the same thing kept happening, and I just couldn’t take it anymore after having experienced a taste of actual privacy living away from home. After the last unannounced visit, I told him if he couldn’t respect my privacy, I would get a lock installed. I think he thought I was joking—I wasn’t.

I called a service and scheduled an installation for when I knew my dad would be out of town for work. I asked my mom (52F) in advance for permission, and she supported it—she knows I’ve been at my wits’ end with this for a long time. I have money saved up from my job, so paying for it wasn’t an issue. Nothing complicated, it’s just a little hook and chain.

When he got home, predictably came right up to my room, and couldn’t get in, he freaked. Started rambling about how dangerous this was, he needs to be able to get in in case of emergency, etc. I admit my medical history is unfortunately rather colorful, but just know the kinds of emergencies he’s referencing are *highly* unlikely. On top of that, I’m positive that lock is nowhere near sturdy enough to prevent someone from busting in if they really needed to. Besides, I told him I’d consider removing it altogether at some point if he could prove himself capable of knocking first.

My brother (17M) thinks I was an ass for locking him out when he just wants to spend time with me. I pointed out that he never gets barged in on, so he has no room to talk.

I’m a grown woman—I feel like I deserve a crumb of privacy. I feel like I should be able to get dressed without constantly looking over my shoulder. I wouldn’t mind his visits at all if he’d just fucking knock first. Still, even though I knew he’d be mad, I certainly didn’t expect this level of emotional distress, and now I kind of feel bad. I didn’t mean to give him anxiety—I genuinely just didn’t know what else to do.

AITA?

Edit since it’s been asked more than once: Medical history involves several surgeries and an overarching genetic condition. But there has never been an instance in which I became suddenly and unexpectedly incapacitated, and because the condition was caught early and has since been monitored closely, that is unlikely to ever occur.

86,1dtmvav,AITA for refusing to sleep on a pull out couch during vacation? ,"I (28F) planned a family trip with my parents and my brother (25M). Before I officially booked the Air B&B that we would all be splitting the price on, I sent each of them the listing, showing how many bedrooms, what accommodations, etc. I made sure to double check with my brother as the house is only 2 bedrooms. One room has 2 full size beds, the other a king bed. I asked if he would mind sharing a room with me as 3 bedrooms in this area were harder to find. He said it was fine because we’d each have our own bed and asked me to book it. Once our parents signed off on it, I booked it.

When we arrive, before we even have our first night’s sleep, my brother declares he thinks he and I should alternate sleeping on the pull out couch in the living room. I say I’m not going to do that. If he doesn’t want to sleep in the room designated for us, that’s fine. But I’m not sleeping on a pull out on vacation when there’s 2 beds. I asked why he doesn’t want to share a room and why this didn’t come up sooner. He said we were adults and he was “too old” to share a room. I asked why he didn’t bring this up sooner. He said he figured I’d agree to the pull out situation. I said he shouldn’t have assumed or at least had a conversation with me. He kept insisting and I said no. If he wants to sleep out there our whole vacation, fine. But I’m not alternating when I paid for a bed.

Him sleeping on the pull out lead to several conflicts with our parents as he’d get mad if they came into the living room in the morning while he was still sleeping but as they pointed out, it’s the living room, a public space. If people wanted to hang out in the living room at night, he’d start bugging us to go into our rooms so he could sleep, as early as 8 PM. We’re on vacation, we’re going to stay up a little later and hang out. I always offered to let him sleep in the extra bed in the room but he refused unless I promised that I would sleep on the pull out that night. Which I didn’t do.

By the end of the (7 day, 6 night) trip, he was irritated with all of us over this. My parents and I feel that he’s the one who put himself in the situation and that there was an alternative to him sleeping on the couch but he chose not to. However, my brother is insisting that I should’ve swapped with him.

As I'm stay at home mom (we have 5y old too) I fully breastfeed the baby day and night. Both kids are in the bedroom with me where my husband sleeping in spare room.

Baby now nurses at least every two hours and then the older one some times wakes up in the night and wants a chat. I haven't had a good night sleep in a while and my husband is complaining to be about his bad night sleeps! And that he needs a naps when he's home for lunch or at least weekends.

90,1dtle6v,AITA for telling my dad's husband I don't want him to adopt me and his bringing up my dead father is not winning me over?,"I (16m) have two dad's. One died before I was born; daddy. He was my non-bio father and his best friend was my parents surrogate. She's my Aunty Giga. My dad is my bio parent and my daddy's widower. And yeah, I say dad and daddy, and still say daddy as a 16 year old guy. Dad always referred to daddy as... daddy to me so I use it.

A month before I was born daddy died. My dad changed completely that day. Because of where we live, even back then, my daddy was still able to be recognized on my birth certificate. It was a fight and involved the courts. But it happened. It was really uncommon back then but he won the case thanks to Aunty Giga and other family members recognizing my two dads.

I grew up always knowing about daddy and I always cherished the connection to him. I was always glad my dad won the right for both of them to be legally my parents. I was also always treated like their son, not just dad's or not dad's and Aunty Giga's. 

When I was 4 my dad tried to date again and he met Sam. They dated for about 3 months but dad wasn't ready and Sam didn't like what he saw. He felt jealous and insecure that he wasn't being brought in as another dad for me.

They reconnected when I was 8 and got married when I was 12. My relationship with Sam is complicated and weird and he wants to adopt me. But I don't want him to be my dad, I don't want to be adopted by him or to have him take care of me if I become an orphan. He has always made it a point to bring up the fact daddy wasn't my bio father in the first place and how legally it was a miracle he's even on my birth certificate. I hate it. It feels so gross. He has told me at least I'll know him while daddy is someone who's just saintly in my mind because I wasn't allowed to process only having one parent. Even though I know I was raised by one parent. But I still had two. He just wasn't here. But I read the book he was putting together for me. He documented a lot of the parenting journey and surrogacy stuff and the pregnancy until his death. He was so excited. He loved me so much. He wanted me so badly.

On Father's Day we had a big fight over adoption. Dad was out and Sam brought up the adoption to me. He told me he's tired of feeling like an outsider because I always treat him like dad's spouse instead of my stepdad or my parent. I told him because that's what he is and he has to learn to accept that. I told him nothing changed for me. He told me it's stupid because I love one stepdad so much more. I told him daddy is more than just a stepdad and then I told him I don't want him to adopt me ever and bringing up daddy isn't winning me over. I told him if anything he's making me wish dad had found someone better. Dad doesn't know what happened but things have been tense since and Sam said I went too far.

91,1dtkvm6,AITA For not consuming a piece of media my partner likes,"So to start my partner(M27) and I(F28) do things the other only marginally likes all the time. I’ve gone to Taylor swift concerts for him (I can’t stand her) and he’s gone to weird art installations with me (he thinks it’s nonsense). I’ve watched horror movies with him (hate horror) and he’s watched weird experimental films with me.

I don’t like soccer but I’ll go to game parties with him and he will go to pottery classes with me (he’s not an artsy guy)

So to be clear WE DO THINGS WE DONT LIKE BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO THE OTHER ALL THE TIME.

The question comes specifically for tv shows, books, and video games, (NOT MOVIES, as it’s not a long time investment)

My perspective is that we share where we overlap, so there’s tv shows and games we both like and we DO watch or play together (Mario games, stardew valley, the morning show etc.) and areas we don’t. We can suggest stuff but I would never expect my partner to watch all of Smallville or Full Metal Alchemist with me if he doesn’t like it. 

So I wanted to watch the latest Dr. Who. I don’t really care about order, he wants to watch it too but he realizes I haven’t seen every season previously(he originally included classic who but “compromised” for only modern who). To catch up is about 100+ hours. So I watched a couple episodes of the ninth doctor and I realized I didn’t like Dr. Who that much and didn’t want to sit through 100+ hours so I said as much.

He got angry at me and said Dr. Who has such great story and lore and he wants to have in-depth conversation about and if I really cared about him I would watch it all with him. That I was being selfish for not wanting to watch a media he has been waiting to share with someone.  

This isn’t the first time either we had a similar argument when I didn’t want to play the Pokémon games from his youth (3 in total) again I tried and didn’t like them. Now I will engage, he has talked to me about both things and i happily support.

On the flip side I haven’t asked anything similar of him. I love the LOTR books but by god I’m not gonna force home to read them if he doesn’t want to just so we can share and discuss???

He got angry at me and said Dr. Who has such great story and lore and he wants to have in-depth conversation about and if I really cared about him I would watch it all with him. That I was being selfish for not wanting to watch a media he has been waiting to share with someone.  

This isn’t the first time either we had a similar argument when I didn’t want to play the Pokémon games from his youth (3 in total) again I tried and didn’t like them. Now I will engage, he has talked to me about both things and i happily support.

On the flip side I haven’t asked anything similar of him. I love the LOTR books but by god I’m not gonna force home to read them if he doesn’t want to just so we can share and discuss??? ",0.0,0.1125301718711853,0,1
92,1dtjnmy,AITA for asking my grandma about wedding planning money for a cancelled wedding?,"While visiting my father, I (34F) learn that earlier this summer my grandmother gave 10k to a cousin to plan her wedding (scheduled for January), and is planning to give another cousin the same amount once she sets a date. She has told the family that once someone sets a date they will get this money, and anyone who doesn't get married will get this money after she passes. 

Here is a little complication: One year ago, I cancelled my wedding four days from the event after finding out my fiancée had carried on an affair throughout our engagement. I of course still had to pay for half of everything. I never expected any money from my grandma and she never gave me any, I also refunded money to many people who gave wedding gifts of both sides. This past year has been hard financially, though I have a good job and am through the worst of it, in part thanks to some support from my dad.

My grandmother is wealthy but it is mostly tied up in stocks. She does typically give us each a check for several thousand dollars each year at Christmas. My dad told me about this wedding planning money highly upset and feeling I'd been wronged. My sister was also upset, and she had also asked my grandma about my situation and had been told that if I get engaged again and set a date I'd get the money for that wedding. 

I decided to just go talk to my grandmother about it, I told her what I had heard and said I'd been a little hurt and surprised hearing she'd given my cousin money for wedding planning given that hadn't been offered to me, and that I just wanted to clear the air between us and understand what was going on from her. She got highly upset, told me I only wanted her for her money, and made a big deal about going to the bank the next day and getting me a check. My dad is also upset with me for bringing it up.

93,1dtjlym,"AITA for blowing off a getting-to know dinner with my SO coworkers after I learned he is going on vacation after a work retreat with 2 of these female coworkers and sharing a room with one of them for 1 night?
","Backstory: my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. He moved to the UK for work (I'm 2 flight hours away) and he has a work kick off in the states lined up. For the kick off the company is paying the rooms so he has his own.

After the kick off, he and two of his female coworkers (they both have boyfriends and I am about to meet them and their SO for the first time tonight) wanted to go from LV to LA because they've never been. For the extra night in Vegas that they have to pay themselves, the female coworker apparently asked my partner if he would be okay sharing a double room (2 beds) for that night so she can save money. Her boyfriend seemed to be okay with that. The day after they go on the road trip and stay in LA for two days in an Airbnb, they all have separate rooms there.

I just got to know of everything once it was already booked, he didn't ask me if I was okay with it. According to him all this happened when we were in an argument so he didn't want to bring it up. He also said he knew I would cause a scene, so he wanted me to get to know them first which is supposed to be happening tonight.  

I feel deeply hurt by being left out of that decision. He knew this would hurt me but he says its only because I am overly jealous. This makes me in return feel very immature. I did occasionally get a bit defensive as of late because I feel very left out despite having supported him in his choice to move away for work (he didn't have to, applied as he wanted to work for a big company and get the living abroad experience). I also didn't get ""overly"" jealous or make a scene when he went on a boys trip for his birthday to Portugal, had to go on a work trip with a female co-worker for a week (they spend all day with each other), went backpacking in Central America and didn't get back to me for a whole week sometimes within that 1 1/2 months. Now it makes it seems as if I am a hindrance to his self-development when I feel like I am just asking him to consider myself because that is my understanding of a relationship. When I told him (in the middle of the argument) that ""I'll just be doing whatever I want from now on too"" he just said ""that would be great for you"". 

  
AITA for skipping on this dinner and not even getting to know these people? I already feel like I've been so left out and I'm not in the mood to meet anyone at all. At the same time it could probably come across as if I'm a rude, irrational person and that I let anger get the best of me. Dinner would be in 8hrs and I don't know what to do.

95,1dtilbe,AITA for not moving in with my friend?,"Throw away account.  
I feel like I should start at the beginning so everyone can get a full grasp of me (female 23)  and Jessica (female 22) friendship. I moved to a suburb near Seattle in 2021 I worked 3 jobs to financially support myself (hate student loans $980 a month?! That's rent T\_T) I had a really hard time making friends, everyday I felt so lonely and lost. Until I met my boyfriend… but.. long story short he was very controlling and toxic. After 2 years of mental abuse I finally got out and moved to Seattle. I tried putting myself out there but I was so terrified of letting anyone in.   
  
Around the same time in October 2023 I met Jessica. We immediately found a connection and it turned out we lived in the same neighborhood. Jessica helped get me out of my bubble, we would go out drinking, go to parties, and have these deep conversations about life.   
Our friendship blossomed very quickly. I was so excited to finally have a friend! It just so happened our leases were up the same month, August 2024. We started making plans to move in together, looking at 2 beds since we both have cats and like our own personal space. As we got closer to moving in together suddenly her lease was up in June (I still don't understand why the date changed, idk if she just wanted to lie or what) This cut our time in half. Jessica lived in a 1 bed by herself, she wanted me to move into the one bed to save on rent. I really didn't want to do that because I wanted my own room. I suggested she do month to month while waiting for my lease to be up she refused. Jessica renewed her lease and made me feel like the only option was to move into her one bed, so I agreed.   
  
As the move in date approaches Jessica started to change. She wanted all of my time, if I had any other plans she'd get angry with me. My time no longer meant anything to her, if she needed me I better be there. It was all about Jessica's time. I tried talking to her about this and she just went on a rant that I'm too sensitive and too autistic.   
Everyday her rude comments got worse, she'd call me names and attack the things I liked. I tried to have a conversation about how her words make me feel like crap all the time. She said being rude is just how she shows love. I continued to put up with it because I really believe I won't find any other friends in this city.   
Jessica's behavior hasnt gotten better, I’ve had enough. I told her on June 26th I do not want to move in with her. She blew up on me calling me a liar, saying that I’m the reason she's going to end up on the streets having to sell her body. She told me she's gonna go sleep with her toxic ex because I ruined her life. That I’m forcing her to live out of her car now and completely fucking over her life.

I met her family after we'd been together a year. SIL was actually the first. Very first time we met she blurted out that I have a girls name (Skye) and then proceeded to laugh about it. My wife told her to shut up and stop laughing. It didn't bother me at all back then. I just laughed and told her there are plenty of male Skye's around, even my great grandfather who I was partially named after. I was named after my great grandpa *Schuyler* who went by Sky his entire life and Sky Masterson from Guys and Dolls.

So the first time was no big deal. Some people have asked me before if I felt like my name was a girls name and not a guys name and I never minded.

SIL joked a lot about my name and our kids names when we were expecting our babies. It got a little annoying but you know, I was able to brush it off and my wife would cut off her sister and would tell her to leave if she went a little too far which only happened once back then.

We didn't see her a lot for a while but she got engaged last year and was around more, and seemed to have calmed down a lot. And now she's having her own baby, a girl, and oh boy is she really testing my patience. 

It started with her husband asking what she thought of the name Skye for their daughter. She joked that they couldn't use the name because she didn't want me to feel more like a girl than I already do. My wife told her to grow up and we left. Next time we saw her they announced Skye was the name they decided to go with. I said cool. SIL said she was surprised I was okay with sharing my name with a girl. I told SIL her daughter wouldn't be the first and I wasn't insecure in my masculinity and I saw no problem with sharing the same name girls or women. Next time we saw them it was a joke about putting both Skye's in pretty pink dresses when her daughter is born. We stayed out of her way for the rest of that visit. Then she joked that I had finally gotten embarrassed by my name and was using my middle name, because one of my uncles who always called me by my middle name was visiting and she heard him call me that. More stuff like that happened and then Saturday we were back at my ILs house for MILs birthday and SIL was joking with some of MILs siblings about my name and she tried to involve me by calling me over to tell her dumb jokes. It finally got to me and I asked her does she have to be so annoying. I told her her how tiring it is to always hear her dumb jokes, which aren't even really jokes like she claims, but insults directed at me. She called me sensitive and I told her she's the person who hasn't given up on my name in over a decade. I told her everyone gets it, she sees Skye as a girls name, but she's not funny. SIL got mad. My wife told her she was about to become a mom and really needed to listen to us and grow up.

I usually always come to his place because he doesn’t have a car, so it’s easier for me to come to him. Today, it was supposed to be the same. But yesterday evening at about 11 in the evening we changed plans last minute and said he would come to me instead. Now, this was very last minute so I didn’t tidy my place (I didn’t expect anyone to be coming to my place), and since it was 11 in the evening, I wasn’t gonna do it then.

Cut to the morning; i wake up at 10 in the morning and I text him “See you at 1!”. He says “You mean eleven?”. I was confused. I asked him what he meant and he said he was coming at 11 because he wanted more time together. I told him that the plan was 1. So you come at 1. I woke up at 10 and can’t tidy my place before 11. He told me that he doesn’t mind mess. I told him it’s my place, he’s barely been here because of I convenience and I wouldn’t feel comfortable with him coming early while Im not done cleaning. 
I don’t wanna rush cleaning, or want him here when I’m in my element and cleaning. We had an agreed upon time. He says no, I’m about to be on my way,  and you’re just gonna accept it. 

I told him that if he really disrespects my request and the agreed upon time like that, he can just stay home and not come today.

Edit: phrasing ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITA for telling the person I’m dating not to come to my house anymore for the day? So me (M22) and this guy (M25) have been dating for about six months.

But yesterday evening at about 11 in the evening we changed plans last minute and said he would come to me instead. Now, this was very last minute so I didn’t tidy my place (I didn’t expect anyone to be coming to my place), and since it was 11 in the evening, I wasn’t gonna do it then.

100,1dthkud,AITA for pressuring my GF to stay the night?,"Background: GF (27f) and I (29m) have been together for 1.5 years, but we live an hour apart, so we usually meet once a week. We have a mutually agreed upon schedule and take turns driving over to see each other every week. When I drive to her place I don't stay over because she lives with roommates. When she drives over she stays the weekend since I have my own place, and she is normally perfectly happy and willing to spend the night.

Now the incident: this past weekend, GF drove over to my place on Saturday afternoon \~1pm. When she arrived, she told me that she wanted to drive back the same day and not stay over because it was supposed to rain the next day. For context, she is absolutely terrified of driving in the rain as well as after dark. Which meant she would only be able to stay a few hours before needing to head back.

We had both checked the forecast which said the rain would start at noon on Sunday, and would be light overall, maybe a few inches. I originally expected that she would at least spend the night and drive back the next morning. But she was afraid the forecast could be wrong -- so while she would normally stay, she didn't want to take that chance this time because of it.

I was unhappy with her decision and told her so. I felt like her choice reflected on how she prioritized my importance and the quality time we manage to spend together vs any potential risks and her fears. We already only see each other once a week, and cutting short her visit would mean waiting another two weeks before the next time we can spend a weekend together. If the situation were reversed, I feel like I would absolutely have taken that chance for her.

We argued quite a bit over this, in a calm and respectful way. In the end, GF agreed to spend the night and drive back the next morning, on the condition that if the forecast is indeed wrong and it started raining early, I would drive her back myself, which I agreed with. While I was glad she decided to stay, I feel like I may have pressured her into staying and that she would feel resentful after this. AITA?

103,1dthgt2,AITA for refusing to pay for a second internet hook up,"A little back story: I 31M have a roommate 43F. We became friends in Feb 2023. They told me they were being bullied at work and couldn’t take it anymore so I agreed to help them financially for small amount of time so they could quit their job and find something better. After quitting they started telling me how bad their roommates were and I helped move them move to their friends apartment one state over. 

That was good for about 2weeks and then they started telling me how awful that friend was and they needed to move back. I helped them move back and into a different friends place. That lasted about 1 week. Mind you I was still supporting them financially during all of this. 

Feb 2024 we finally got our apartment and it was suppose to be a safe place for both of us. I paid first and second months rent as well as deposit and application fees as they still didn’t have a job. They set up the wifi under their name though and managed to get some money to pay for it. End of March they finally found a decent paying job. This is when things went south. 

They started being very short with me and a lot more passive aggressive. When I tried to ask them what had changed they got mad at me saying I was being mean and awful. There have been several fights since. Most recent they were pausing my devices on the wifi and refused to give me access to the account since it was under their name. I tried to ask about getting a new service that didn’t have any person info on it that we could both access and they refused saying they would be keeping the one they have and I could get a separate one. So I did. 

I set up the new modem with a splitter so we would both have access to the wall hook up. This according to them has degraded their wifi and they are demanding I pay for a second wall hook up to be installed and stop using “their wall hook up” I told them we share in rent so we share that hook up and if they want a separate hook up they are more than welcome to get one but I won’t be paying for it. They said they had wifi first so it’s on me to fix this as my new modem is the issue. I in turn told them that they did not have wifi first, and that “we” had wifi but I had to get a separate one because of them. 

There is so much more I can’t fit here but will answer any and all questions, but am I the a hole for refusing to pay for this?

104,1dthg2h,AITA recorded my partner without permission,"My partner and I had been together 2.5 years. Four months after we moved in together, I began to realize they really struggled with their anger management. I also started noticing their anxiety level was much higher than I originally thought as well. Their anxiety spiraled when it came to controlling all the little details in the house, everything had to be “just so.” From what I could gather they controlled their anxiety by controlling their environment and by extension the people in that environment.
Little did I know at the time my partner expected me to conform to their predetermined house rules and way of doing things. I suddenly lost all autonomy I felt. Everything from how the fridge had to be organized, how the pots and pans have to be put away, how you should wash the dishes, where you can park your car, where your dog can sleep and how your dog should be trained.
Don't get me wrong. My partner made excellent points for all of these rules and I was excited about the relationship and motivated to make it work long-term. So I conformed to these rules and regulations as my previous relationship was not healthy and overall, I don't have a great baseline for what a healthy dynamic should be. As the months ticked by I began to see their anger constantly bubbling at the surface and any little thing that was out of place or not done exactly how they had explained to me they would blow up and create a narrative around why I didn't do it a certain way. Usually painting me as a selfish person that was inconsiderate and not willing to respect their boundaries and rules.
A little context about me and my personality. I'm known by everyone in my life as the easy going bubbly, empathetic, compassionate person. Often I'm compared to Joy from inside out. So to hear these harsh criticisms about me being selfish and inconsiderate was quite jarring. I took the criticisms to heart and adjusted as much as I could. It got to the point where I made extensive notes to keep track of all of the rules that they had laid down for me. The relationship and its future meant a lot to me and I was dedicated to making it work.
All of our other arguments went similarly though. I would remain calm. Try to make a point. Try to understand, try to empathize. Try to just discuss! while they would rage out and yell at me and devalue who I am as a person, criticize my motivations and overall shred my fragile self esteem to bits to the point of tears. And multiple times they would continue to yell at me even when I broke down in tears, and criticize me more for trying to manipulate them using my tears.
The relationship weighed heavily on my mind, and my self-esteem started to tank. The self-esteem took years to rebuild after a previous toxic relationship and all this time I had been telling myself “maybe I'm just playing the victim. Perhaps I just need to lay all my trust at their feet and trust that they are genuine and trying to create a routine and a home that will work best for all of us.”
Now, I am a person that respects privacy. I truly and morally believe it is not right to videotape or record someone without their permission and I take that seriously. But My doubts of the health of the relationship finally took over. I needed to know for sure. I was so confused and generally felt crazy. I decided to record one of our discussions So I could listen to it afterwards, analyze it and understand what is going on.​ I suspected this conversation would not go well because most of our discussions about my feelings didn't go well.
I began talking about how the ​anger in the relationship and how unsafe I felt. They immediately dismissed my feelings! said that's my “interpretation"" and that ""they've never done anything to make me feel unsafe, and they're not responsible for how I feel”. I tried to bring up situations as examples and they promptly had deflective statements to throw back at me. Always speckling in criticisms about who I was and how I was messing up in all of these ways. The point I tried to focus on was that I was trying the hardest I can. I'm human. I make mistakes but I'm dedicated to the relationship. They effectively devalued ALL of my contributions to the relationship. Finally I got to the point where I said I cannot live with them anymore. I wanted to also say when the lease was up I wouldn't want to renew it with them. They went into a rage. Bright red face vein popping out of their forehead. The person I loved was not in those eyes. They were screaming at me at the top of their lungs until their voice went horse. 
My friend listened to the whole thing later and was horrified. She confirmed all of my worries. My partner was verbally abusive, dismissive, and projected all their insecurities onto me, they gaslit me and manipulated me to say things exactly how they wanted me to say it so it would fuel their argument. Everything I feared was correct. I was in an abusive relationship with a narcissist.
Later my partner reached out and tried to get me to come back to the house and continue the lease for the next couple of months because they would be financially ruined if they had to take responsibility for my bills. I told them I was not going to set one foot in that house again. I was not safe. They continue to criticize me for abandoning the family harming the family being selfish and thoughtless and cruel and terrible in all of these ways. They attempted to gaslight me about how the situation went and what was said and in a moment of stupidity I admitted I had recorded them and that I had the audio recordings. And then I promptly sent them everything and they raged out about the legality of it and the morality of it, all of which I do agree with. It's something that should not be done in my opinion.
I've been stewing on it for the last couple of weeks, despite me being against recording someone without their permission. I'm wondering if there's a gray area where I am, in fact, not the ass hole in this situation.

Just to clarify, I have no bad intentions here—I genuinely think the guy and I have a lot in common, and I don't have many friends. This guy has been a frequent topic of conversation between my friend and me, so I feel like I already know him a bit. I'm engaged and getting married in September, so I'm definitely not looking for anything romantic. I just find him interesting and thought we could be friends. 

To give you more context, my friend and I were both curious about this guy because we kept running into him in various places. She really liked him physically, and we didn’t even know his name. After some stalking, we finally found his Instagram account about six months ago. She added him first, and I decided to add him just yesterday. When he messaged me, he immediately recognized me as my friend’s friend. We talked about hobbies and walking, and that was it. I told my friend, and she reacted oddly.

I need some advice on a situation with a friend. Recently, I added a guy on Instagram that my friend likes. Just to clarify, I have no bad intentions here—I genuinely think the guy and I have a lot in common, and I don't have many friends. This guy has been a frequent topic of conversation between my friend and me, so I feel like I already know him a bit. I'm engaged and getting married in September, so I'm definitely not looking for anything romantic. I just find him interesting and thought we could be friends. 

To give you more context, my friend and I were both curious about this guy because we kept running into him in various places. She really liked him physically, and we didn’t even know his name. After some stalking, we finally found his Instagram account about six months ago. She added him first, and I decided to add him just yesterday. When he messaged me, he immediately recognized me as my friend’s friend. We talked about hobbies and walking, and that was it. I told my friend, and she reacted oddly.

106,1dth9bn,AITA for shrugging when my dad's wife told me they need all of dad's money right now?,"I (17m) might be TA and I might be a big one but I wanted to get people's insight.

So my dad left my mom when I was 14 to be with his wife/the woman he was cheating on my mom with. My dad didn't want me to think badly of him but I did. He knew I did and he knew he couldn't change my mind easily. We always knew my parents would end up with shared custody until I was 17 at least (from experience the judges in family court will only stop enforcing shared custody when a kid turns 17 and speaks out, any younger and they insist on 50/50). I also knew mom would struggle on her own because while she did work, she never made as much as my dad. She also wouldn't get child support because of the 50/50 and it wasn't ordered even with the difference in income. So when dad pleaded with me to give him a chance to show he could still be a good dad and he said he would do anything for me, I told him to keep supporting mom and make sure she wasn't going to end up struggling while he got off easy. I told him she deserved that at least, after what he did, and that I deserved to see my mom doing well.

My dad agreed and he paid it as child support instead of spousal support or whatever it's called. It really helped mom and she actually went back to school so she could get a better job. Dad is still paying that money. He knows I appreciate him doing it and he also knows it's one of the only reasons I didn't just decide to say fuck him and never want a relationship again. My mom is also less stressed. She has mixed feelings about my dad giving her money when legally he doesn't need to. But she also knows this is the only way for me not to feel the need to help support her.

Where my dad's wife comes into it is this. She never liked that my dad paid this ""child support"". She never liked that I insisted on it for my dad and I to have a relationship. But now my dad's house is struggling a bit and some changes needed to be made. His wife's son and daughter were in dance, football, softball, karate, music lessons and an art class as paid extra curricular's. My dad and his wife also have a baby together. The wife's kids had to cut two activities because they can't afford it anymore. It pisses his wife off because if dad wasn't paying the money they could still afford those things. She told me I should stop obligating my dad to support mom because they need it more and my mom isn't their problem. I told her she and her kids are not my problem. She told me they're my family while mom is not her or her kids' family or my dad's anymore. I told her she and her kids are dad's family but not mine. She told me they need all of dad's money right now before more things need to be cut back on. I shrugged in response. She told me I was so callously flippant and it wasn't a good look to care so little about my siblings lives (only one of her kids, the baby, is technically my half sibling).

Early on we relocated across the country for a high earning job opportunity for myself. This allowed me to provide fully and gave my wife the opportunity to pursue her dream PhD. I have carried us financially throughout this period ensuring we are well taken care of in our lifestyle and for retirement. We historically split household tasks and have had a strong relationship. 

At the conclusion of her program we relocated again to support her career aspiration. It set me back a bit in my career, but I was happy to help her pursue this dream. After the relocation this changed dramatically. I still earn 2/3 of our income, but work from home 80%. With her in the office 100% I have organically taken on all the household tasks, management of our finances, scheduling, etc. This has not been a problem because I understand her job is demanding and I want to support her. Despite my best efforts, I am starting to buckle. 

I asked her to help out more because I am beginning to feel run down. Unfortunately, she snapped at me hard. She feels that her job is much harder than mine and more demanding. e.g. ""You don't understand how hard this is. Why are you making things even harder for me."" In her words, my job ""is easier"" because it's mostly remote, so I should be able to handle what I am doing. She took it a step further and suggested that ""I'm not as accomplished as I like to think"". This feels really out of character and an overreaction.

109,1dtgnqn,AITA for telling my friends kid hes creepy?,"Ever since my best friend (37F) had her son(13M) I(35F) have been an aunt to him. I take care of him after school until she gets off work and I truly love this kid to bits. He's so creative and smart and passionate about his interest in animation.

Also, this kid has always struggled with social ques in a way that often comes across as creepy to other people. Things like not making eye contact, lurking, staring, not making eye cointact, laughing at odd times, always speaking with a monotone, no facial expressions, sometimes having a very fake smile, and giving gifts to people that they never asked for but always kinda like. 

I know none of this comes from a place of malice, he's a sweet kid genuinely he's just struggling with socializing. But this kid respects clearly stated boundaries better than any other teenage boy in the world. 

As an adult on the spectrum, I suspect that this kid is autistic. 

The other day when I picked him up from school he got in the car with tears in his eyes and asked “Why doesn’t anyone like me?” 

That broke my heart to hear. This wasn't the first time he'd asked, so I told him he had some mannerisms that other kids often found creepy, but that he wasn't doing anything morally wrong. Some of us just need to learn how to socialize instead of it coming naturally. 

He lit up at this. “How can you tell when someone doesn't like something?” “Well usually if they look upset or sad.” I explained. “How do you know when someone's sad?” he asked. At which point I realized he didn't understand facial expressions.  

So when we got home I found some socializing work books for autistic kids online and we went through them. I hid the autistic part, because I suspected his parents wouldn't want me armchair diagnosing their kid. But he loved it. He was more excited than I'd seen him in a long time. 

When his mom picked him up that night I briefed her on what had happened that day and she agreed to seek a professional opinion.

For the next week after school we did little socializing lessons and he loved it. He even seemed to be having better interactions with his classmates. 

This evening when my friend picked him up she confronted me because apparently over the weekend he'd told her about the talk we had in the car and thought I called her son a creep. 

I figured something got lost in translation and tried to explain to her that I said some of his mannerisms made people feel a little creeped out even tho he wasn't doing anything wrong. Which I feel is an important distinction.

She said I was trying to change him, and hurting his feelings and giving him a complex. As hurt and upset as I am, I did laugh when I heard him say excitedly “Mom I can tell you're angery!” as she stormed off with him.

I (19F) recently got a girlfriend. We had been working at the same fast food place for about a year when she broke up with her asshole of an ex-boyfriend, and we got together a couple of weeks later.

A little background: I’m pretty active on Discord since I have a few online friends I keep up with frequently. Before my current girlfriend and I got together, I had been talking to this girl online who we’ll call Piper. Piper had some stuff going on in her personal life with her older brother and took a mental health break from the internet. Around the same time, my mom got pretty sick, so I also took a step back from the internet to focus on her.

School ended, and I started working more hours, spending more time with the girl I’m now dating, and focusing less on my online life. Piper and I barely talked for a good two months or longer, and the whole situation was on the back burner for a while. Recently, I found out Piper had grown to like me more during the time we hadn’t spoken, which I had no idea about.

This all happened pretty recently, and my girlfriend and I have only been together for a couple of weeks. I joined a call with Piper and about three other people and mentioned in passing that I had a girlfriend. Piper got very upset, and a mutual friend acted as a messenger to let me know how she was feeling. This made me feel incredibly guilty.

The next few days were a bit of a blur as I tried my best to focus on the girl I was dating, but then Piper DMed me asking if we could chat. During our conversation, she explained that she was hurt that I didn’t inform her earlier that I no longer liked her the way I did. She thought I had been with my current girlfriend a lot longer than I had been.

I joined a VC with Piper and the mutual friend after the friend DMed me, telling me that Piper was thinking about distancing herself from me after this whole ordeal. Another friend of mine outside of the immediate group knew about the situation and told me that if Piper thinks distancing herself from me is what’s best, I should respect that and not try to interject. I agreed and am taking a step back from her.

Piper told our mutual friend that she was upset I didn’t tell her about my feelings for someone else sooner and that I didn’t tell her I didn’t like her anymore. A lot of my online life was put on the back burner due to my real-life issues, and I admit her feelings weren’t at the forefront of my mind.

My mother inlaw pays for his cell phone bill, pays part of his monthly rent, uses her vehicle a few times a week, has a debit card of hers and probably more than what we know about.

The mother inlaw just lost her husband just over a year ago, is on pension and not working, all the while they were ok but not a rich family let's say.    

Now here's the part that's bugging me.   My brother inlaw has 3 kids with his girl friend now that live with him and has 2 other kids from a previous marriage that he gets every other weekend.

114,1dtf6pv,AITA for asing my date to split the bill? ,"recently, I (m20) matched with a girl online (20f) and we agreed to meet. we went to a cafe, talked, ordered food and were having a decent time....till the bill arrived. 

now I have a rule that I always split the bill. since I am a college student and not an earning member of the society, my finances are covered by my parents. to me, it only makes sense for me to pay for someone as long as it comes from an emotional place rather than an obligation. all the other dates I've been on, the girls have agreed to split.

 I would pay for someone if I'm in a relationship with them, because it's out of love. doing that on a first date isn't something I'm comfortable with. I believe since we're both equal members of the date, neither of us was forced and we're willingly on the date, it's both our responsibility to pay for ourselves.

so anyway, the bill arrived and she was waiting for me to pay till I asked how we planned to split. she said that she assumed I'd pay. I told her I'm much more comfortable splitting the bill and explained my point of view. I don't think she agreed with me. till then the waiter arrived and asked us how we'd pay. she didn't say anything, I honestly feel she had no intention to pay

we both looked at each other and said nothing so I simply asked the waiter to bring us separate bills for the only two dishes and drinks we ordered. that seemed to have offended her. I paid for my share and she, unwillingly, paid for her share. we didn't say a word to each other after that and she definitely seemed pissed. I walked her down, waited with her till her cab arrived, asked her to take care and she left. 
I now see we're unmatched and she's blocked me on Instagram.

115,1dtf5ah,AITA for cancelling my holiday?,"Im not much of a writer.
So I have a ‘best friend’ who lives in a different country, she’s coming on holiday here to aus in a few months and at first I was excited to see her. I get 4 weeks of annual leave each year and so I requested to use 2 weeks to go on holiday with her and not have to be at work while she’s here, and I’ve tried to plan things for us to do but apparently it’s all too expensive (even tho I make good money and have offered to pay for us to travel around aus and do fun stuff), she refused all of my ideas and then said her ideas of going on a picnic or a hike. So here’s where the problems started, she has another friend here in aus which I don’t get on with too well but it’s not a big deal, I thought because she will literally be travelling with her for months leading up to her coming here then there would be no issue with her spending 2 weeks with me but I was wrong, she wants to spend the entire time with her. So we sort of agreed she would make time to go do something. So far she has made no actual plans to do something new and exciting for OUR holiday (I say our cause I’m using my limited annual leave simply to see her) and yesterday it all kind of blew up, she told me that during the 2 weeks I’ve requested off from work she will be going to a 4 day festival. The ticket is $400 and if she’s getting accomodation at the place that’s another minimum 400 not including all the other expenses it would be for the festival. The plan I came up with for us to do  To put into perspective, it would cost about 250 for the flight, another 400 for the accommodation and then any other expenses for our time away and it would cost her 0 dollars cause I could easily pay that but she says that’s all too expensive. So anyway yesterday I told her I’m considering cancelling my leave so I don’t end up wasting it while she’s away and she acted very toxic and started gaslighting me so I told her I’m reconsidering see her at all and all she had to say was I’m in Sydney for 22 days, you can either come see me or let your insecurities prevent you from seeing me at all. I’m convinced she doesn’t actually want to see me and that’s why she didn’t come up with any actual plans with me, booked to do other things with different people during the time I’m on leave from work, and acts extremely toxic towards me.

I have been friends with half the friend group for about a year and a half, the other half of the friend group joined when me and my gf got together about 7 months ago. The problem starts with Emily (not her real name) who was dating my gf’s bestie’s stepbrother. He gets involved with a scandal and they break up. My gf is over at her bestie’s house a lot, so she sees Emily’s ex. Not much she can do about that but Emily isn’t too happy with this and starts shit talking abt my gf. My gf’s ex bsf, Stefanie (also not her real name), is now bsf with Emily and both don’t like my gf. Then Stefanie tells everyone in our friend group that my gf was involved in the scandal that broke up Emily and her ex and they end up leaving our lunch table, even my bsf left with no explanation. It has been proven that only the ex had been involved, he even admitted to it himself. So at this point everyone except for two other people (not including my gf and me) from the original group hate my gf. Since then we have stopped talking to them and sit at our own table. But recently, I found out from mutual friends that they keep telling themselves that I abandoned them, which I can see why they think that bc maybe it never occurred to them shit talking and openly hating on someone I love dearly would cause me to leave them??

118,1dteorb,AITA? Bridesmaid dropped out,"My wedding just passed and it was everything I dreamed it could be after a year of planning. 5 days before the wedding by bridesmaid told me she couldn’t come to the wedding anymore. 
My fiancé and I got engaged a year ago and started planning our wedding right after that. We booked our venue in July and I had asked all my bridesmaids set by September. One of the bridesmaids I asked also got engaged around the time we did but decided her and her spouse wanted to do a small elopement in the future. 
Fast forward to a couple months ago we have all of our vendors booked, and sent out our invitations. My bridesmaid decided that they were going to move states 10 days before my wedding(after RSVPing Yes for both her and her fiance). She reassured me multiple times that she wouldn’t miss the wedding no matter what. 
Now it’s the end of May and her and her fiance decide to get married last minute in Vegas. They spend over $1000 on the trip and she starts telling me she doesn’t have any money because of her wedding and the upcoming move.
At the beginning of June she tells me her now husband can’t come to the wedding, but once again reassures me that she won’t miss it. She tells me that she’ll book a flight to get in two days before the wedding. The only problem was she was very prominent that I pick her up. I told her I couldn’t pick her up because I was making my bouquets and prepping for the wedding. (The airport is about an hour and 45 minutes away from me). I offer to buy her a shuttle ticket and she refuses. She really didn’t leave me any options it was either picking her up or her not coming. (Even though she offered to take a shuttle back to the airport after the wedding) So I offer that my sister can pick her up. 
Fast forward to 6 days before the wedding. My sister was very anxious about driving to the airport alone to get the bridesmaid. I didn’t want to put more anxiety on my sister, so I ask my bridesmaid if it would be possible for her to take a shuttle instead of my sister getting her. 
The bridesmaid gets super upset that I suggested that she take a shuttle and got upset with me “changing the plans last minute” I offered again to pay for it but she was too upset with me since she felt I was in the wrong for changing plans so close to the wedding. She texts my sister saying that she might have to cancel on coming to the wedding because she has spent too much on her move. (she only had to pay for was her flight since she was staying with my sister)
The next day I get a message from her saying that she was sorry but then the message changed to her saying I have been in the wrong this whole time. She said that I didn’t support her and her marriage, that she felt undervalued as a friend and that my wedding was holding her back from getting a job.
She told me that emotionally she couldn’t be at the wedding and then she proceeded to block me and all of my bridesmaids.

They also wanted to spend the holiday with their granddaughter. My sister rolled her eyes and I simply said I can’t ask them to not come because my bf had already invited them. As soon as I said that my mom exploded and said we should have our own separate lives as they were my new family and that I only cared about them and I should allow my sister to openly disrespect them since they werent anything to her. I couldn’t hold my anger anymore and said that we would enjoy the holiday fine without them and that all I ever did wass include them even more than my in laws.

If my bf and I travel with our baby she grows upset over us not taking her, if I buy something she becomes upset over me not buying her the same thing. It’s gotten to the point where I have to hide so much of our lives to avoid arguments.
I exploded today when going over July 4th plans . I mentioned to her and my sister that my in laws would be joining us since we would have to use their car and they had no plans. They also wanted to spend the holiday with their granddaughter. My sister rolled her eyes and I simply said I can’t ask them to not come because my bf had already invited them. As soon as I said that my mom exploded and said we should have our own separate lives as they were my new family and that I only cared about them and I should allow my sister to openly disrespect them since they werent anything to her. I couldn’t hold my anger anymore and said that we would enjoy the holiday fine without them and that all I ever did wass include them even more than my in laws. ATP i’m considering partially cutting them off but I dont know if I’m overreacting.

But, in the 17 years we have been married my husband and I have never once traveled anywhere together.

Thinking that it is time to get out and spend some time together, I suggested a weekend away to New Orleans for our anniversary in September. I found a great package online with SWA and brought it up to him. I was excited thinking it might be a great time for both of us. Neither have been to NOLA. I want to visit the French Quarter, take a dinner cruise, and go on a ghost tour, he has mentioned wanting to visit the cemetery and the odd shops they have with oddities. My husband, however, did not think it was a great time or idea. 

He immediately told me that he refuses to travel again so close to our family vacation and that I’m sinking us into debt and financial ruin. He told me it was unrealistic to think we can travel again any time soon. Not wanting to argue at that moment, or in front of the kids, I simply replied “Okay.

123,1dtdg02,"AITA for calling my parents assholes after they bought my brother my DREAM car
","Here's the backstory. My parents told both my brother and me that they would buy our first cars to help us get started in life. My(23F) first car was a Malibu back in 2018 bought for just around 31000 CAD and I was super grateful to my parents for this as it helped me get jobs and spend time with friends. My little brother (18M) got a Cadillac CT4 last year for his first car, priced around 44000 CAD with COVID inflation. I was already kind of annoyed that they got him this car instead of something closer to my first car but I just let it go because of the COVID excuse and how inflation was at the time

Here's the part where I've been pretty upset over, my little brother just recently got into a car accident and completely TOTALLED his cadi. He tried to turn left through two lanes of heavy traffic to come home after work and got hit by someone traveling in their own lane all because ""it was faster to get home"". Insurance deemed him completely at fault and wrote the car off, giving my parents a check to pay it off and get a new car. After paying the balance of his car off they had about 12-15k left over for the new car. My dad took my little brother to the VW dealer and they saw the Golf Type R(54000 CAD) my brother really liked it, so they decided this was the car that they were going to get as the replacement. If you know anything about cars giving an 18-year-old a type R is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.

The reason I'm so upset over this is when I first was looking at cars my DREAM car was the type R, the style and drive of it is something that I have always been attracted towards. When we were originally looking for my first car we went and test-drove a golf GTI and my parents immediately said no and it was ""too much power for me, and was too expensive"". I brought what they said up after they told me what car they ordered for my little brother and was immediately told it didn't matter this was what was happening. I asked them why couldn't my brother just get a Malibu like me and they said ""That's a downgrade for him and isn't good enough for him"" which took me back and really hurt me because I viewed what they said as ""well it was good enough for you but not him and he deserves better than you"" so we had a pretty big argument and I called them assholes and said they were treating him and I differently.

I've already been really upset with my parents about how they've been treating my brother compared to me when I was younger, he gets to go out on school nights, he hasn't gotten in trouble for missing curfew(multiple times), drove to school in grade 11 when I was only allowed to senior year. After the argument we had about the car he was getting, I haven't really been talking to any of my family because what they said really frustrated and hurt me with how different they're treating me and my brother. So AITA for being upset over them buying this car.

124,1dtdeb1,AITA for abandoning a trip with friends?,"I (22M) was invited on a camping trip with 7 friends at the start of June. I knew everyone except one person, Eliza (20F), who began joining our Discord calls to get to know the group. We hit it off, and three days before the trip, we started ""officially talking."" She heavily implied exclusivity through text, saying things like, ""there is one other thing you have to be... mine <3"". We told Karl, the organizer, about our budding relationship, and he informed the group, including Carson (19M), a friend we've known for about a year and a half, but whom Eliza had only met once in a Discord call.

Eliza mentioned she might be very shy upon meeting me: ""I just get nervous, don't be surprised if I actively avoid you the second I see you."" I said I'd be nervous too, but we agreed to find time for ourselves. The night before the trip, she asked me to buy weed for her. I was uncomfortable, but agreed. She rode with me to get it, and we shared the 2-hour ride to the campground. Upon arrival, she started avoiding and ignoring me.

The next day, Eliza continued to avoid and ignore me. Carson openly flirted with her, and she was receptive. They spent a lot of time together, sitting, talking, smoking, drinking, and laughing. At one point, he sucked on her finger. This made it clear she wasn't just being shy; she just didn't like me. As I said, we weren't official, so she was hardly cheating on me, but I'm pretty sure she just used me to buy weed for her. I felt I was at least owed the decency of a simple ""I'm sorry, but my feelings for you aren't what I thought they were.""

At night, Karl, Mordecai, and I drove up to the check-in lodge ""to call home"" as an excuse to get away from the group. Karl told me that he was extremely angry with Carson because before the trip he quote: ""told Carson not to do ONE thing, and that’s what he’s doing."" That being, flirting with Eliza. He also told me that Carson knew Eliza and I were involved before the trip, meaning Carson was fully aware of what he was doing. The feeling of betrayal from a good friend is what pissed me off most. Carson was fully aware he was flirting with a girl I liked right in front of me, and didn't think that it might offend me.

Karl and Mordecai had spoken to the others on the trip, and told me Carson's flirting was making everyone uncomfortable. I said I wasn’t having fun and wanted to leave, which both understood. We went back to camp, Karl told everyone (except Eliza and Carson) that I was going to leave, and they all said they understood. Once everyone had gone to sleep I packed up my tent and drove home.

I feel guilty about departing 2 days early when everyone else seemed to enjoy my presence, and I'm certain my sudden disappearance caused some stress for the remainder of the trip. I probably could have toughed it out, but the vibe was rancid and I felt intensely disrespected.

On one of these helpful days my grandma wanted me to drive her around so she could do some shopping and what not, as we were finishing up she told me to sit in the passenger seat, which I thought was odd but hey it wasn't my car so I had no say, we eventually got in the highway and I asked where we were going, she said we were going to the state mental hospital.I instantly got a horrible feeling and planned out my nextoves quickly. I asked over an over again why we were going thereand she wouldn't give me an answer. when we arrived she told me to follow and I did. I thought I was gonna get admitted for no reason, sure my life's been hard but not enough to make me go insane. 

As she was signing some paper work I texted me Step dad who immediately jumped from his chair and started the car, my mom even took time off of work just to come with.

When they left the house, they told me to go wait outside for them and we'd sneak away before my grandma noticed, but the front desk lady wouldn't let me leave she said I had to stay while the consultant was almost ready, I demanded I be let outside but nobody would budge, eventually the guy who was consulting us was ready, I was about ti go ibto a full blown panic attack and locked myself in the bathroom. I couldn't hide anymore and left to go to the room where he was waiting. 

Wanna guess what this was all about? My Grandma had no clue how to talk to me about anything and figured a therapy session would help. I blew up in her face and told her that if she wants to talk she can talk to my backside because I didn't wanna hear her lame excuses as to why I wouldn't be willing to talk about things. Hell I don't even think she was telling me the truth the either, I asked to be let outside like I had been demanding for the last 30 minutes, they consultant let me out and that was that.

Fast forward to a week ago, she spam texts me asking if I'd help her with some chores again, but I just ignore them.  I don't know what to do, she just seems so fixated on the fact that I'm growing up and she's trying to stop it in the wrong ways possible. 

I'm honestly scared that she'll one day just come force her way into the house just so she can see me. Reddit I need help Am I The Asshole or is she just crazy

129,1dtcxp7,AITA for not leaving my room throughout my birthday party?,"This is quite possibly one of the worst days of my life and I feel like the biggest douchebag right now.

Every year, I've told my mom, constantly, that I do not like surprises. I especially hate attention, being the center of things, and every year, she's promised me, that that year would be the last one that she would throw without my consent.

This year especially, I told her, specifically, that I did not want to see anyone for my birthday. I told her not once, not twice, but maybe up to 100 times. I don't know if I spoke in chinese or something, but as far as knowledge concerns, she understood the message clearly. Anyway, she once again promised me that she wouldn't do it this year.

For context, I have social anxiety. Now I don't care if you believe that anxiety is fake. In my case, it's not. I've been making constant efforts, to get out of this on my part, to step out of my comfort zone, but having everything everywhere all at once (great movie) feels like getting penetrated by multiple people at the same time.

A few years ago, I suffered from an illness, mind you, it was kind of my fault, but it happened, and I survived, yay. Aside from the physiological, that illness brought a lot psychological problems that I am still trying to heal from, one step at a time. There's so much more to this, but I don't want to share my whole life story. Anyway, she knows this very well.

Skip ahead to present day. Today I woke up, had plans, was going to exercise, do some personal works, go out for a drive, and play some video games (it's Canada Day where I'm from). Then my mother tells me not to leave the house, and that people were coming over, that's when I put two and two together and figured it out.

I tried to stay calm, I really did, but I began to experience heart palpitations, and they got to me very rapidly. My aunt was there too and she began trying to calm me down. I explained that I did not want this, and that I've constantly said so in the past.

Now this party, didn't consist of a few friends, but a whole army. You see, my family reproduces like rabbits. We're like a thousand people. Anyway, in total, she probably invited like 20-30 people. That's not a crowd, that's a town, all in one small space.

While all of my friends agreed, that this was not right on my Mother's part, they also proposed that since the damage was already done, that I should just suck it up. I couldn't stand by this, not this time.

My Mother proposed that I should just stay in my room, and that is exactly what I did the whole day. It sucked, so bad. No amount of music could block out the laughing and cheering coming from the outside, it was hot, and deep down, I felt like crap.

Now I don't know if my friends resent me, and my mother refuses to talk to me, and I just feel lonely as hell. This is the worst blow that I've taken in a very long time. I am hurting like a mother f\*\*ker.

130,1dtcx00,AITA for arguing with my mother regarding how she is handling the sale of our family home?,"(30M) have two older sisters, one who is 35 and the other 31, and a widow mother, who is 62. Recently, my mother informed me that she intends to sell our family home, which is worth between $1.5 to $2 million, to my middle sister.

My middle sister and her husband typically wouldn't be able to afford this mortgage, so my mother must sell it to her at a discounted rate. My mother’s logic is that she will then purchase another apartment for herself, worth between $1.2 to $2 million, which my older sister and I could split after she passes away. This apartment is intended to be her final property.

There are several reasons why I'm upset about this decision:

* Favoritism: It feels like my mother is showing favoritism towards my middle sister by giving her the family home at a discounted rate, while my older sister and I may have to wait to receive anything.

* Timeline of Inheritance: The age disparity in receiving assets feels unfair. My middle sister gets the benefit of owning the family home now, while my older sister and I have to wait until our mother passes away to receive anything.

* Gloating: My middle sister has been rubbing it in my face that she now owns the family home, which makes the situation even more difficult to accept. I was never involved in any discussions and right now, I struggle to even look at her as she believes she's entitled to the house despite having two siblings.

Outside of this my older sister is quite well off and lives in a country town, so she doesn't really care about the financial aspect. Her stance is that she wants the family property to remain in the family, which is why she supports the idea of our middle sister buying it.

When I spoke to my mother about it, I was quite frustrated as she couldn't understand my point of view. She went on to try justify her decision and even told me I should seek therapy.

I hate talking about inheritance, but I feel like I needed to stand up for myself. I prefer everything to be split equally among us siblings, without anyone getting an unfair advantage.

I confronted my mother about her decision, expressing my frustration and disappointment, and argued that it felt unfair. This confrontation might make me the asshole because people might see it as me being ungrateful or causing unnecessary conflict within the family. I could be wrong for challenging my mother's decision and potentially straining family relationships, especially given the support from my older sister and the overall family dynamics.

She has never been able to handle any criticism and becomes very defensive and verbally abusive. From a young age I learnt to stay silent to keep the peace. I run a business and hired her around 4 years ago - since then it has always been the same story.

I’ve tried to get her to leave and she refuses. Now I have to swallow my words to avoid an argument because she says I’m unreasonable and that I’m power hungry. Today in particular I pulled her up on being 1 hour late and she lost it - she said she expects flexibility because I’m her sister. I said I think she’s just lazy and doesn’t want to get up, and not to bother coming in to work at all. This sent her into a frenzy - she “quit”, said that I am abusive, that I am a narcissist, that i expect too much, that I treat her horribly and that I am exactly like my ex (my ex physically, verbally and emotionally abused me).

133,1dtc6so,AITA for wanting my sister to stay out of my house,"Some background first: I (15F) have a half sister who is 17 years older than me (32). We have the same dad and I live with both of my parents currently. She lives with her husband and 2 kids (1 and 4, both boys) about a 10 minute drive away from us in a condo that is slightly smaller than our house.

Since Covid cooled down, the 4 year old has been coming over on sunday mornings and my dad has been watching him. I don't necessarily mind that, but when it first started happening, I didn't like it at all. My dad told me they were in the process of getting a nanny so i just decided to suck it up. Now it's been two years, there is another kid, and the oldest is in preschool. Now that the oldest goes to school, my dad picks him up every day and brings him to our house until about 6 pm. On most days I'll get home at about 3:30-4:30, so I have to walk into an absolute madhouse of a hyperactive toddler. My house is not large and the walls are very thin, so I can hear everything while trying to do homework. I'm especially sensitive about it now because I'm doing summer school and studying for the ACT which I'm going to be taking in about two weeks. So, I've covered sunday through friday. On saturdays, my dad has decided that it is a great idea to invite my sister, BIL, and the two kids to our house to swim in this tiny hot tub that we have in the backyard. This would be great, since we have a little shed with a shower outside and everything, except they come over at 11am and dont end up leaving till around 4, and they don't swim for more than half an hour. They also live two blocks away from a park that has a really nice pool with sprinklers and a waterslide and everything. My dad will always invite them over without telling me or my mom, so I'm always caught off guard. My mother doesn't like it when they're there either, but she doesn't want to make waves. I've tried proposing other things for my dad to do, like babysitting at my sister's house now that she and her husband don't work from home anymore, but my father is absolutely adamant. When i told my therapist about it, she thought that it was weird that my dad was such a hands on grandfather.

some more background that i thought was significant. My sister has never lived in my house full time. The house was originally my mom's and my dad moved in a few months before i was born. Right after i was born, my sister jumped ship to go live with her mom since she didnt want to live with a baby, then went to college. Also, my sister's mom will sometimes have the kids over (maybe once a month) and they live really close to all of us also. Sister's mom just sets boundaries and says no sometimes

tl;dr my dad brings over his grandkids every day and it's been really rough on me. Am I the asshole for wanting my dad to cut back on inviting my sister and the kids over?

134,1dtc6ch,AITA for asking my neighbor to not cut across my grass lawn to go to another neighbor because it freaks our dog out?,"Live in a friendly community-driven small neighborhood. A couple of houses on my side of the street have steep driveways but manageable. Over the years my neighbor (let’s call them “Cindy”) and their good friend “Rob”have had the habit of crossing over my lawn right by my house steps (instead of walking up their own driveway and across) when going over each other’s houses (my home is sandwiched between them both). It’s not great and it does feel invasive as I now have seen through my ring camera multiple times of their walking past AND looking towards my home. I’ve tolerated it…when I’ve been given a heads up and genuinely I am trying to be an understanding neighbor. 

However I noticed when I have left on vacation (which sometimes I share in passing) that their walking over my grass exponentially increases and they don’t say anything. Lately even when I am home they are doing the same and walk across with their own dogs. 

Here’s the thing: I have a dog and since working remotely now more than I used to, my dog is very protective. So now when they walk over it sets my dog off barking which has disrupted several work calls and meetings. I’m able to calm my pup down. I finally drew the line was this past week. My partner and child were quite sick and at 8am on. Saturday my neighbor decides to walk across, Cindy sees my dog barking and continues to walk across.

At that point I sent a kind but to the point text (I even asked how they were as a general check in). I explained the situation that having them cut across with my dog barking is tough and that it woke my partner and kid up who are sick and trying to get better. 

I never got a response back nor an apology even though they have seen me a few times while running errands etc. Now I’m second guessing what things they might be telling our other neigbors and potentially creating misguided bad blood. And yes Cindy is the type of person that knows and tells everyone’s business. I’m just surprised they haven’t said anything, though realize it might be saying more about them than me. 

AITA for asking neighbors to respect my property and help keep my dog calm?!!! I feel like I’m taking crazy pills! (Will Ferrell reference). Any thoughts are appreciated.

Edit: thanks to everyone for your kind, clear feedback and for also making me feel less insane about this whole situation!

Over the years my neighbor (let’s call them “Cindy”) and their good friend “Rob”have had the habit of crossing over my lawn right by my house steps (instead of walking up their own driveway and across) when going over each other’s houses (my home is sandwiched between them both). It’s not great and it does feel invasive as I now have seen through my ring camera multiple times of their walking past AND looking towards my home. I’ve tolerated it…when I’ve been given a heads up and genuinely I am trying to be an understanding neighbor. 

However I noticed when I have left on vacation (which sometimes I share in passing) that their walking over my grass exponentially increases and they don’t say anything. Lately even when I am home they are doing the same and walk across with their own dogs. 

Here’s the thing: I have a dog and since working remotely now more than I used to, my dog is very protective. So now when they walk over it sets my dog off barking which has disrupted several work calls and meetings. I’m able to calm my pup down. I finally drew the line was this past week. My partner and child were quite sick and at 8am on. Saturday my neighbor decides to walk across, Cindy sees my dog barking and continues to walk across.

At that point I sent a kind but to the point text (I even asked how they were as a general check in). I explained the situation that having them cut across with my dog barking is tough and that it woke my partner and kid up who are sick and trying to get better. 

I never got a response back nor an apology even though they have seen me a few times while running errands etc. Now I’m second guessing what things they might be telling our other neigbors and potentially creating misguided bad blood. And yes Cindy is the type of person that knows and tells everyone’s business. I’m just surprised they haven’t said anything, though realize it might be saying more about them than me. 

AITA for asking neighbors to respect my property and help keep my dog calm?!!! I feel like I’m taking crazy pills! (Will Ferrell reference). Any thoughts are appreciated.

Edit: thanks to everyone for your kind, clear feedback and for also making me feel less insane about this whole situation! ",0.0,0.0161967221647501,0,1

Usually when his ex gf drops their son off on weekends me or my parents are watching him. Well today he was talking about getting a job and trying to become a good father for his son and I spoke up saying how he doesn't do his duties as a father as of now anyways.

He got upset and told me to stay in a ""child's place"" and I got frustrated and started yelling at him saying how a ""child"" watched his own kid more than he does and he is a grown ass man. I sometimes have to cancel my plans to watch his son meanwhile he goes outside all day and goes to sleep with other girls as if he doesn't have a child he needs to cater too. It got real quiet after I said that and he told my mom to ""get me in check"" before leaving the house.

Now he's staying with his friend and texted my mom that he isn't coming over anymore or bringing his son over so my parents can see him. He's putting all the blame onto me and now my parents are also blaming me a little saying I should have went easier on him as he is struggling and trying to do right by his son. But I feel like he needed to hear that.

136,1dtbqb2,WIBTA for paying my half of rent without my sister (roommate) knowing?,"
For context, my sister and I have lived together for several years. We don't really have other family in the area but she and I have lived well together, of course other than the occasional spat. But this argument has made me want to reconsider our next steps. 

To make a long story short, we have been in a standoff with the landlord as they have been prolonging the fixture of our HVAC. My sister wanted to withhold rent until it got fixed. I was unsure of this as legally we had no grounding to do so as landlords have no obligation to provide air conditioning in our state. She held her ground. I told her that maybe we should just threaten the landlord with the idea of not paying rent, ask for compensation if we can and we would go from there. 

They have made progress towards the repairs (they finally got a bid) as well as asking us to email their management team for compensation. Though it wasn’t guaranteed, its farther than we had gotten in the last month we had been fighting with them (+ the year we had to wait since the initial report). I was happy, my sister was not. She wants it fixed now and she is standing on her belief to not pay rent. 

When I asked her why she was fighting this so hard, my sister admitted she had accidentally overspent her portion on an outting we had with a friend and was hoping that the leasing office would agree to the compensation sooner so we can pay a lesser amount. Plus, why would she pay rent if its not fixed? How does she know that if she pays, they’re gonna continue to follow through? (Her words.)

I told her that if she didn’t want to come home to her stuff being outside, she needed to cough up rent. She told me that I was going back on my word, and that we would look like a joke after everything we had been through this past month. I was going to offer to cover whatever was missing when she said “And my dog? What if my dog dies from dehydration, even after we pay rent?” (Side note: she has a long haired dog that is home alone for 6 hours and only has a fan to help with the heat) 

I shrugged and said “Then wouldn’t you want to pay rent so you didn’t come home to him being left outside?” She scoffed and hung up the phone. 

We typically pay rent at the end of the month and our 30 days is officially up as of today. 

I have my portion of rent, without the compensation. I went and got the check (as we have to pay irl for rent) for my half of rent. But I’m starting to have second thoughts. How would she feel if she found out I paid? What happens if she decides, even after knowing I have my half, that she still doesn’t want to pay rent? 

As for right now? My sister and I aren’t talking. She texted me she doesn’t need my help with her dog and that she “doesn’t want to have this conversation again.” 

WIBTAH if I payed my half anyway? And AITA for wanting to pay rent at all? I just don’t want to have to come to my stuff outside after I work so hard because she’s being stubborn.

She had 3 kids which is my aunt Amy & aunt Becky & my nanny which is my mom’s mother. 


   My great grandmother told the three sisters that my nanny would be left the house that she was currently living in that was at a different location than the land & that my aunt Amy & Aunt Becky would both split the land in the county and give two acres to each grandkid..she included that all grandkids get two acres & that also included my nanny’s kids was to also receive two acres a piece as well. 


    The only stipulation was that my mom was not to be able to get her two acres if she was still dating the man she was with at the time. He was a black man & my great grandmother was raised in the old ways that you don’t date outside of your own race. My mom hasn’t been with that man in over 15 years & last I heard he is in prison & probably isn’t getting out. 


   Well my aunt Amy & aunt Becky decided to sell the land to my aunt Beckys son..aunt Amy gave her land to aunt Becky and together they sold all but 6 acres that my aunt Becky is planning to give to her grandson from what I was told. They never talked to my nanny about their decision or my mom. In my opinion they basically stole my mom’s land. And when they were asked why they would do that, the response was about her relationship with her ex. Which has been over for many years. 



    The crazy part of it all is..my Aunt Becky married a man who claimed he was a Christian & such a great person who loved helping the family.. well he wasn’t. Truth is that man put me through a lot behind closed doors when I was young & I didn’t have the guts to tell anyone until I was 18 years old & I had to get it off my chest to get past it. Turns out when I spoke up I found out that I wasn’t the only one he had done terrible things to, someone else had said he did things to them as well way before I had spoken up, but nobody would believe her at the time. This terrible man passed away about a year ago. 


   Both of my aunts are super Christian raised in old ways, back then you wasn’t supposed to divorce so I believe even if my aunt Becky knew something was going on she still wouldn’t have left him because she didn’t believe in divorce at all. I just don’t understand the thinking that dating outside your race could ever compare to a person marrying a creep that caused so much trauma.

I 15ftm have been mostly living with my mother all my life. Her and my dad broke up before I could turn 1 and my mother was the one to have most of the custody. Before running away I would see my dad every Thursday and switch weekends with him and my mom.

My dad has had tons of girlfriends in the past, all of them being psychotic. So that gave me massive trauma. This caused me to go through a horrible depression that Reddit won't let me go in complet detail. But my mom knew about it and did nothing.

My school found out and forced me to go to the hospital and I wasn't allowed to go back til I went to therapy. At the hospital my mom forced me off the bed, and made racist comments. That's when the light switch went off. I realized how dehumanizing she made me feel, along with her being a terrible person over all. She would constantly call me over to her like a dog, pat places where she wanted me to sit, ect ect.

After the hospital I went to therapy and have been going to therapy since then.

When I was 14 I had to go to the hospital again (due to my highschool) and right after that she left me alone in the house. When she came back I told her that I really felt like ending it all and said my plan. She said ""no, because the stuff we have would only hospitalize you."" Now, I have to be vage here for Reddit, but she tells me what wouldn't hospitalize me and would do the job.

Because of all of this I went to my brother and his fiancées' place where I would stay from right after school til after dinner. She allowed this happen, like, I'd ask her everytime but she still always guilt tripped me about it and make me feel bad for going.

Eventually; I had enough of it and ran to my dad's. He picked me up at the middle school I live by.

I told him the situation a few days after that (I went more in depth). And he told me a lot of stuff I don't remember.

He said that my mom made me emotionally independent to her when I was 2 or so, making me cry every time I saw him. When he asked my what was wrong I always responded to ""I'm crying because moms crying.""

He told me a lot about what happend when I was younger and that really made me see what kind of person she is.

Of course, a while after my dad got the court involved because I'm technically not allowed to be staying with him full time.

Currently, I see her every weekend.

I've been trying to rebuild my relationship with her since thats what my therapist and dad want, but it's difficult. She constantly brings up that I ran away from her, she says nasty stuff about my family on my dad's side, every time I've done something minorly wrong she dead names me as punishment, and she still treats me like I'm a dog.

I'm asking for any kind of feedback because her words are really getting to my head, she calls me names because I left her and I'm really going back into a depressive episode.

Eventually; I had enough of it and ran to my dad's. He picked me up at the middle school I live by.

I told him the situation a few days after that (I went more in depth). And he told me a lot of stuff I don't remember.

He said that my mom made me emotionally independent to her when I was 2 or so, making me cry every time I saw him. When he asked my what was wrong I always responded to ""I'm crying because moms crying.""

He told me a lot about what happend when I was younger and that really made me see what kind of person she is.

Of course, a while after my dad got the court involved because I'm technically not allowed to be staying with him full time.

Currently, I see her every weekend.

I've been trying to rebuild my relationship with her since thats what my therapist and dad want, but it's difficult. She constantly brings up that I ran away from her, she says nasty stuff about my family on my dad's side, every time I've done something minorly wrong she dead names me as punishment, and she still treats me like I'm a dog.

I'm asking for any kind of feedback because her words are really getting to my head, she calls me names because I left her and I'm really going back into a depressive episode. ",0.0,-0.015425662510097027,0,1
143,1dtaz27,AITA for throwing away my best friend’s half eaten bag of chips?,"okay so basically i (f 23) was at my apartment when suddenly i had a baaddd bpd + eating disorder episode. the chips that my friend (f 23) brought and left at my house, were ofc, one of my BIGGEST trigger foods. and she KNOWS THIS.

i tried to get over it but eventually it got to a point where i decided that id toss out this already almost fully eaten bag of chips for now, and id buy her a brand new bag right in the morning. i thought that it would be okay.

well turns out it really wasn’t at all according to her. she’s been calling me weird and rude and said how it’s annoying of me. i told her i was sorry but i truly didn’t think she would mind and if anything, i thought she would understand, as she struggles with some things aswell.

she then went on to say how if i was in her shoes, id be upset too, but the thing is i truly wouldn’t be??? because like if my friend was genuinely going thru something like i would understand. like its just a bag of chips. especially if they said they would buy me a brand new bag. she told me she didn’t wanna talk to me anymore for a bit and she just now blocked me on twitter. 

i’m a bit flabbergasted because i truly didn’t think it would matter much to her and my friends agree with me but like idk?? i do think i could’ve done better with communicating with her and i did try to at the moment but she always has her phone on DND and i couldn’t get ahold of her. 

am i the asshole?

144,1dtasdq,AITA for telling my friend I don’t want to hear her complain about her boyfriend anymore,"Hey! So I (f28) have a best friend Nancy (f27) who I’ve been best friends with since Jr high. Nancy has a boyfriend Steven (m26) who she’s been with for 9 years. 

Steven is a jerk. Plain and simple. He is manipulative , he is verbally and mentally abusive and what I am convinced is a narcissist. 

Every single day, Nance complains to me about him yelling at her , and will send me recordings of their fights , and every single time I tell her she’s clearly unhappy and to just leave him. 

She just won’t. They fight every single day, she knows he’s manipulative , she knows he gaslights her , but she says “But I love him” everytime me or someone else says to dump him. 

Recently , they had a huge fight and he disappeared for 3 days , and didn’t text her once or anything. I spent the full 3 days with her , trying to comfort her and help her. I told her the same things I always do

He’s an ass, he treats you like shit , you agree that if roles were reversed and it was me in your shoes you’d want me to dump him, etc etc. 

He finally showed up back home at 8am yesterday morning , and now they’re just suddenly fine again. She said “he apologized and promised to work on himself” the same way he ALWAYS does. 

I got annoyed and said “seriously , you just forgave him again just like that??” 
She was sorta taken a back and was like yeah he’s my boyfriend of course I did?? 

So I told her 
“I don’t want to hear you complain about him anymore. I’ve listened to you complain about him everyday for almost 10 years and I’m over it.”

She got upset and said that I’m not a very supportive friend. 

I want to point out , i understand he has her psyche worn down, and has her believing she can’t live without him, but she has a wonderful support system and just refuses to utilize it.

145,1dtarhl,AITA for disagreeing that all behaviours are equal?,"So my partner (M35) and I (F34) have been at odds, a lot, over the kids. For context, my partner came into this relationship with a daughter (now 16) who needs to be assessed for NPD and BPD. I came into the relationship with a son (now 13) that has ASD and ADHD (along with other comorbidities) and a daughter (now 9) with severe ADHD. We recently had two children together, a boy (2) and a girl (3).

Early on (2019), my partner's daughter came to live with us full-time after her mom passed. Shortly after, we dealt with her bullying my son, lying, stealing, manipulation, hypersexual behaviors, writing graphic content, and unsafe online activities due to stealing devices at night. I urged my partner to get her counseling given her unstable past. He was initially reluctant and often needed concrete proof of her actions before taking them seriously. Eventually, he agreed to get her medical help, but often I was the one taking her to appointments. Despite specific guidance from doctors, my partner frequently tried his own methods, and the problematic behaviors have persisted.

Lately, my 9-year-old daughter has been rebellious and has begun lying, which is uncharacteristic of her. Her doctor suggested strategies for potential ODD without immediately resorting to referrals or medication. She has been neglecting her chores, admitting she knows she should do them but doesn't want to, and instead sneaks around to watch TV.

My partner insists that consequences for my daughter should be as severe as those for his daughter in the past, equating all rule-breaking behaviors regardless of severity. He argues that my differing views are biased and accuses me of favoritism. He even suggested my daughter miss her dance and cheerleading summer camp to learn to follow rules since grounding her hasn't worked.

Our relationship has been strained for some time, and my health is deteriorating. At 34, doctors have warned me of serious conditions like fibromyalgia and hypertension, potentially giving me only five years to live if I don't change my lifestyle. I also have ADHD and might have ASD, according to my doctor.

Despite my reservations about equating the two situations, I told my daughter she couldn't attend camp due to the chores issue. Now, I feel immense guilt and uncertainty.

146,1dtak9b,AITA for calling my sister out on her attitude?,"My sister(young teen) has been going through ""that"" phase. The one where she hates everyone and has the attitude of a snapping turtle. I went through that phase as a child as well and as her older sister and friend I'm trying my hardest to help her through it by being understanding and offering as much advice as I can so that she can overcome it, but it's hard to do that when she's such a pessimistic person.

I get it, she's experiencing a lot of changes and it's hard to deal with, but she's becoming less of a normal teen going through stuff and more of a spiteful, ornery hermit.

She's chosen to ignore normal conversational cues. When she's talking, her answers are cold, short and cut off, or mumbled in an angry tone. When you say something about it she lowers her eyebrows and shuts her eyes(it looks like she's rolling her eyes). Then when you mention her facial expressions or body language (like checking her nails or looking at her phone while you're talking), she gets irritated.

Today, I called her out on her constant cold, cut off answers to everything and everyone. I Called her out on her tone, her body language, her facial expressions. Her inability to take initiative when others, her own family, need help with small things.

She said she was trying but if she was really trying wouldn't she act like she cared when someone tells her that they were hurt by her actions or words? Wouldn't she care if they were upset by how she responded? Wouldn't she at least try to pretend that she cared a tiny little bit?

I was exactly like her growing up. I acted even worse than she did. I realize we're not the same, but I actually did something about it when someone brought it up. I tried to change when people said they were hurt.

She tried to play dumb by saying she ""didn't know"" how her voice(her normal vocal pitch) could make her sounds mad or uninterested and I explained( though she knew) that it wasn't her VOICE but the TONE that she used when she was talking to people.

She tried to pretend she didn't know the basic meanings of words or body language or the tone in her voice WHEN I KNOW SHE DOES because she's known it in the past. She uses this false ignorance to get away with hurting people.

told her that she hurts people with her tone, with the way she talks, with her body language, with her facial expressions, and when she gets mad when she's confronted about hurting people.

I told her that she hurts me. She turned around in her office chair and sat silent for a minute. Then she walked out of the room and to her bedroom. I told her all of this out of love because I want her to grow up to be a kind and considerate person. I want her to understand that how she conveys her emotions matters and she has to use her tone carefully. but now I'm wondering if I told her the wrong way.

147,1dtab8t,AITA for calling out my buddy and embarrassing him ,"I (32F) was bartending the other day, and my buddy (35M) whose bar I frequent came to my shift for the first time. He came with a woman he’s dating and his coworker. I was really stoked to see them!

The only other people in the bar were a pretty lit lady who I’ve been building a guest rapport with and her guy friend. 

My friend within 5 minutes of being there tells the  lady that she looks like the “hawk tuah” girl. There’s a good natured laugh at this. He continues to say the same. I get some eye flashes from the pair who were there before my friends, like they’re laughing but getting weirded out. I tell my friend to knock it off a couple times in a good natured tone. He gives me no response and keeps repeating the same thing, I think like 5-6 times he says “hawk tuah.”

I felt pretty disrespected, given that I would never ignore a bartender managing the vibe of the room. I also work at a new bar and I’ve been focusing on making new regulars, so I don’t want anyone feeling harassed or weirded out there. I finally said “don’t make me tell you again.” I dropped the fun tone on that one but it wasn’t angry or raised, just direct. 

Immediately he’s looking at me like I spat at him. 
There’s a little back and forth where he says she was laughing and what’s the big deal, I say pretty much that I would never make a scene like this in his bar and he would never have to repeat himself like I did if it were the other way around. 

His coworker tries to break the tension by asking what the group wants to drink, but my buddy is suddenly stony faced and sulking, quietly saying he doesn’t want anything. He gets up and says something like  “I didn’t want to offend you, but I can’t stay here, I’m going to leave.” 

He tosses a 20 on the bar and the girlfriend and the coworker follow him. I think I might have heard one of them say “sorry” to me, but that might be wishful thinking. 

I feel crazy. This was around 9.30pm, and I doubt he was sober but he wasn’t very drunk either. 

Edit: thanks for the feedback, thanks for your time on a pretty banal post. I’m agree that I’m NTA, but I worry that my action will earn some retaliation and I’ll be labeled in that particular circle as a “killjoy” or a “prude.” With 8 years BOH and 4 years bartending (split between 3 1/2 years in my very early 20s and 6 months this year), it’s just about the most insidiously damaging thing for a woman’s reputation. 

Edit 2: his tone when he said “I didn’t want to offend you” wasn’t contrite, it sounded like he was disappointed that I was disrespecting his premiere visit to my bar. Ugh.

**Context:** I'm over 40, single, and a video game content creator. For the past two weeks, I've been spending a lot of time with my former fiancé, who I consider my best friend. I've been planning a big stream for my birthday night, hyping it up on my socials, and getting sponsor items for giveaways. No one indicated they wanted to do anything for my birthday, so I made my own plans. My three adult children, ex-wife, and other friends didn’t mention anything. So, I figured I’d just plan something myself.

**Former Fiancé:** She has children, whom I love and have played a father-like role for, without expecting fatherly benefits. They usually plan events around me, including Father’s Day, but lately, everything has been last minute, based on the social life of her teenager.

**The Text:** At 7 PM the night before my birthday, she texts, “What are you doing tomorrow night?” I respond, “The big stream event I’ve been telling you about for two weeks. Nobody made plans, so I made my own.” She replies, “So, online birthday, not real life birthday? We made plans, but it was a surprise, waiting to see if the other kids were doing anything.”

**The Conversation:**

* Me: “LOL, shouldn’t you tell the person you’re making the plans for?”
* Her: “We were going to invite you tomorrow to do it on Saturday, but since they didn’t seem to have anything going on, we could do tomorrow.”
* Me: “I’ve been advertising this event on Twitter for a week and a half.”
* Her: “Ok, you do whatever you want! It’s your birthday.”
* Me: “TBH, I was getting upset that no one tried to make any plans with me. I expected a text from (child) at midnight, but had no other expectations.”
* Her: “I try and stay back so your kids can do something, that’s why we have a gift and were going to ask about Saturday. But tomorrow is actually better, so (teen child) asked if we could just do it tomorrow. And seriously, just a text from (child)? That’s rude.”
* Me: “How’s that rude? It’s 7 PM the night before my birthday, and I’m JUST now finding out there is a plan for tomorrow after telling you what I had planned for two weeks now?”
* Her: “That’s fine...”

**Conclusion:** The conversation continued with her clearly angry at me. So, AITA for being irritated over plans that would make me money and cost me money and relationship points with sponsors that I had been planning for two weeks, and for being given crap for not changing them last minute at the drop of a hat?

149,1dta3v9,AITA. My MIL invites my husband's female coworker for BBQ and hides it from me.,"my husband(35) has been working with his female coworker for past 10 years. They are very close. She is married and has 2 kids. She calls and text my husband all the time, even when we are on vacation. I have told my husband in the past that I dont like her texting him all the time. I am not a fan of that woman. Now my mil knows that I dont like my husband's worker. My mil invites her and her kids to a BBQ this Friday even tho I am off on 4th of July and work on Friday. She doesn't mention that to me at all. Now, my husband tells me that he has to go to his parents on Friday. I kept asking him why he has to go on Friday when he has been there few days ago and he ends up spilling that his female coworker will be at his parents because his mother planned that. Now I am furious but my husband keeps telling me that I am a jealous person, and it has nothing to do with me. Maybe I am over-reacting. I just want another opinion to know that if I should be ok with it and maybe I am over reacting. His mother is allowed to invite whoever she wants at her house

UPDATE: I spoke to my husband and he said he wouldn't go to the BBQ if I am not okay with it. He wanted to go because he didn't want his coworker to feel weird. He said that the coworker reached out to his mom saying that she wanted to go to their house with her kids and have a BBQ. His mom didn't say no to her.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITA. My MIL invites my husband's female coworker for BBQ and hides it from me. my husband(35) has been working with his female coworker for past 10 years. They are very close. She is married and has 2 kids. She calls and text my husband all the time, even when we are on vacation. I have told my husband in the past that I dont like her texting him all the time. I am not a fan of that woman. Now my mil knows that I dont like my husband's worker. My mil invites her and her kids to a BBQ this Friday even tho I am off on 4th of July and work on Friday. She doesn't mention that to me at all. Now, my husband tells me that he has to go to his parents on Friday.

150,1dta106,AITA for telling my friend that being a baker doesn't make you burn that many calories?,"Title. For context, we were talking about how he stopped exercising lately, he said it's because he works as baker so he burns just as many as he would by exercising  (He hasn't confirmed this), to which I replied with ""Of all the things you could've said, you choose to say that? C'mon, it's not like you were a construction worker or anything like that, and eve then you would probably still need to exercise"". He then got pretty pissed, saying I was just talking out of my ass and pretty much told me to talk later since he's mad at me.

I replied like that since he's known for making up a lot of excuses so I thought it was just that. Now, he also works very hard to earn money, so what I'm thinking is that he may have thought I was implying his job wasn't hard or that he's just a slacker, or even that my job was harder somehow? I genuinely want to know whether I fucked up or not. One of my friends said he'd get pissed, too, so that left me seriously wondering whether it was my fault or not.
