0,1dtlthi,AITA for telling my friend she was selfish for making her own plans on my wedding day?,"My friend and I are both 27F and have been friends since we were 8 y/o. I got married this past April and she was a bridesmaid in the wedding. About 9 months out from the wedding I learn from my MOH that because this friend doesn't want to pay for a hotel room, she instead had texted the entire bridal party (excluding me and the groom) about booking a large airbnb together with their s/o's. MOH said the group text indicated that this airbnb was for the bridal party but not the bride and groom. This airbnb plan ultimately fizzled out, but I texted my friend/bridesmaid to just to talk with her about how it bothered me that she was trying to make new plans for my wedding party for my wedding weekend without saying anything to me or my now husband. She was very defensive and told me it wasn't a big deal, and dismissed my feelings entirely. The conversation ended and we just didn't have a reason to talk for a while. 

Fast forward to my bachelorette weekend, and lots of wine, and she made some comment about the lodging for my wedding weekend and I snapped at her in front of everyone. I told her that she was selfish and only cared about what she wanted. Later that night we tried to hash things out and I apologized for snapping at her but tried to explain that I did think she was selfish for trying to change my wedding plans without telling me and then also dismissing me when I tried to talk with her about it. I told her it hurt my feelings that as a friend of almost 20 yrs she could care so little about my intentions and opinions of my wedding. When I said she wouldn't appreciate it if the roles were reversed, she told me that she really couldn't entertain that hypothetical bc she wasn't seeing anyone. We smoothed over the conversation that evening but I'm not totally sure that either of us saw the other person's side.

Then leading up to the wedding everything seemed normal again with us and she was enthusiastic about the wedding and left me a thoughtful card on the day of. 

Now that the wedding is over she doesn't speak to me, she didn't tell me she was coming to town multiple times, or that she's moving to the area that I live in. Come to find out she told another friend that she was ""just getting through the wedding"" and had planned to stop talking to me after.

1,1dt9t1v,AITA for sticking up for my child against my husband,"My 15yo son has requested to be able to choose his own baseball gear. For the past few years, my husband (his stepdad) has always bought him his gear. It would be decent gear but some times it would be gear that is on sale but not all the time. Last year my husband got into a huge fit because my son wasn't appreciative of the helmet he bought him. My son said he said thank you but didn't like the design of the helmet. (This was after I told my husband not to buy the helmet and let him choose what helmet he wanted. Ofc husband didn't listen and bought it.). 

My son explained to me that it isn't because he isn't appreciative, he just wants to be able to have a say in what he gets. He sees his teammates being able to and he isn't. This year, I told my husband I was getting him a new bat because he made Varsity and that I was letting him choose. Instead of letting him choose, my husband went ahead and ordered him a bat, gloves, and other stuff. There was an issue with the gloves so I told my husband, why don't you just take him to the store and let him pick? Then it became a full blown argument because apparently until my son starts working, he can't choose and should be grateful he gets anything. Then the husband goes on to say he should have his dad buy his stuff now and live with him all because I ""ran my mouth"". AITA? I would think since my husband played sports before, he'd understand wanting to choose but instead he said he had to be grateful for what he got when he was his age (not entirely true).

2,1dt9r4w,AITA for threatening to leave my mother because she takes long baths?,"Throwaway 

I feel horrible and need to know if I'm the ass. Me and my two children are currently living in my mother's house. This is because my mother was in an accident and can't work anymore. She doesn't get enough benefits to afford to live in her house so we decided that I'd move in with my family and take over the bills. The only thing she pays for is a bit on groceries. I'm fine with this because I think my mother should be able to relax.

Something important to know is my mother has a lot of pain. To help relieve this she takes long, hot baths.  This wasn't an issue before because my children were in school so she had plenty of time to take these baths while they weren't there. The issue is that now that summer has started my children are upset she ""monopolizes"" the bathroom. I know that there is only one bathroom in the house so if she's in the bath they have to wait. Despite this I didn't think it was that bad because surely she isn't in there more then an hour. 

Well I found out l that I was wrong. It started when our neighbor came over to ask if our bathroom is working. When I questioned him he informed me that my children were coming over to his house almost daily to use his bathroom. Now them going over there isn't an issue because he's an old family friend, but I was still shocked. I asked them and they said they have to because their grandmother won't share the bathroom. 

I talked to my mother and she said the girls were being dramatic. I decided to get to the bottom of this because when I'm home she's never in there that long. So I stayed home from work without telling my mother yesterday. I asked my older daughter to text me when she got in the bath. She texted me at about 10:30. I went in to confirm and I could hear her in there. I then waited. She didn't come out until after 3. I was shocked. I could literally hear her drain and refill the tub a few times.

After she got out I confronted her about this because it isn't right my kids don't have access to the bathroom for that long. We ended up getting into a major fight. I told her she can't be in the bathroom that long. She told me it was her house and she could stay in there as long as she wants and I don't understand how much pain shes in. I threatened to leave with my kids and let her deal with the bills if she couldn't be reasonable with the bathroom. She ended up crying and ignoring me the rest of the night.

My children are happy now because she hasn't taken taken a bath in about a week now. I'm worried about her and I feel horrible. I've tried to discuss it but she just tells me she won't cause anymore issues with the bathroom and locks herself in her room.  So reddit I need to know. I'm I the ass here?

3,1dt98y1,AITA for insisting guest put the lid down before flushing? ,"I am 23F and I live with my mom and her boyfriend. When I moved in with my mom I had been working a factory job for two years and had to quit because she lived too far. She told me it didn’t matter and she just wanted me to live with her again. I never got to stay with her for more than a few months at a time as a kid because she was constantly on meth and/or heroine. Now she is clean and I’m very proud of her. When I started college she even told me I didn’t need to search for a job because she was okay with supporting me because she wanted me to go to college. I’ve still been looking for a job on the side and almost got one but it fell through.

My family has never put the toilet seat down. I learned a year or two ago that if you flush without the lid down it will send bacteria and poop particles in the air and onto your toothbrush if you keep it in the bathroom.

At my mom’s place there are three bathrooms. One in her room, one in the hallway next to both our bedrooms and another off from the living room. When I first moved in hers was broken and we shared a bathroom. I asked my mom if she could please put the toilet lid down when she flushed. She said she’d try but might not remember at night if she woke up to use the bathroom. I understood and thanked her for trying. Eventually her bathroom was fixed and my mom told me the hallway bathroom would be my bathroom so this ceased to be an issue entirely.

Today we had a guest over and they needed to use the restroom. I saw after that he had not closed the lid. When my mom went into her bedroom to get something she was giving to the guest I followed her and asked if she was sending someone to my bathroom to let them know to close the lid when they flush. 

She told me she wasn’t going to do that and left the room. I started arguing about it with her in the hallway and we got into a screaming match.

I said there’s three bathrooms in this place and if she won’t ask them that she can just direct them to another bathroom and not the one she told me was mine. She kept saying she wasn’t going to make guest comply with my “quirks” as she calls them. I told her it wasn’t a quirk it was science and sent her videos of medical professionals saying the same thing and an article detailing that e.coli and bacteria can be found in these particles.

She refused to watch them and her boyfriend says I’m making a big deal out of nothing basically and I don’t need to be worried about poop particles if I don’t pay rent. 

I took some tape and put a sign behind the toilet asking to close the lid before you flush. My mom said she’d take it down and I said I’d just put another one up.

7,1dt8dy7,AITA for calling out a guest who wore white to my friend’s wedding?,"This happened a week ago. I (28F) and another girl, M, were invited to my friend’s wedding. We were good friends with the bride in college and stayed in touch afterward. The wedding was amazing. However, there was this one moment I had with another guest that kept me feeling guilty even when I was typing this. 
 
There was a girl who sat at the bride’s family table and wore a bright white dress. I thought it was weird considering guests should not wear white or off-white colors to a wedding. M had some comments saying that it was unacceptable, rude, and inconsiderate because she’s never been to a wedding where guests wear white and then casually walk around, chat with people, and participate in activities. I agreed with her because it was unfamiliar to me too. I suggested that we bring it up with the bride when we have a chance. However, we couldn’t get a hold of her alone for the rest of the night as she was busy going around tables and doing activities. 

I don’t know if it was my instinct to protect my friend or because of my ego, but I decided to take matters into my own hands and walked up (with M after me) to the girl when she sat down at her table. I pointed out that she was being rude for wearing white and for following the bride around while showing off her dress to all the guests. M supported me by agreeing and saying the bride must feel extremely bothered that her guest was trying to ruin her special day. The girl seemed shocked for a bit and said sorry, she didn’t know, and the bride didn’t say anything, so she thought it was okay. I told her that the bride was kind enough to let her stay, cause if I were the bride, she would’ve been kicked out right when she walked through the door in that dress. M said a few more things then we left. I thought my action was justified and felt kind of proud for sticking up for my friend. For the rest of the night, I sometimes looked over the girl’s table and noticed that she didn’t leave her seat until after the wedding was over, and she left with the bride.
 
I contacted the bride a few days after the wedding to thank her for the wedding gifts and for inviting me to her wedding. Then I brought up the girl and asked if my friend was bothered by her at all. To my surprise, she didn’t and even felt happy that the girl did. She clarified that the girl was her niece who flew from another country to attend her wedding and that the dress she was wearing was a gift from my friend herself. The niece even sewed in two swans to symbolize my friend and her husband loving each other eternally. That’s why she was showing off the dress to all the other guests. My friend also told me that guests not allowed to wear white to a wedding is never a thing where she came from, so people do it all the time. I just feel so guilty and embarrassed after knowing this, because the girl looked extremely down after my confrontation.
 
I thought I did the right thing but now I just feel like an AH. So Reddit…am I the AH?


Edit: I get it. I’m TAH. But in my defence, the girl’s dress was very pretty like a fairy gown type of dress with a lot of extravagant details that the bride’s dress didn’t have. I didn’t know that it was my friend’s gift to her before calling her out. And I get that I’m ignorant culture-wise, and I will try to think better before acting on my thoughts next time. Thank you all for the criticism. ",Asshole,2024-07-02,"AITA for calling out a guest who wore white to my friend’s wedding? This happened a week ago. I (28F) and another girl, M, were invited to my friend’s wedding. We were good friends with the bride in college and stayed in touch afterward. The wedding was amazing. However, there was this one moment I had with another guest that kept me feeling guilty even when I was typing this. 
 
There was a girl who sat at the bride’s family table and wore a bright white dress. I thought it was weird considering guests should not wear white or off-white colors to a wedding. M had some comments saying that it was unacceptable, rude, and inconsiderate because she’s never been to a wedding where guests wear white and then casually walk around, chat with people, and participate in activities. I agreed with her because it was unfamiliar to me too. I suggested that we bring it up with the bride when we have a chance. However, we couldn’t get a hold of her alone for the rest of the night as she was busy going around tables and doing activities. 

I don’t know if it was my instinct to protect my friend or because of my ego, but I decided to take matters into my own hands and walked up (with M after me) to the girl when she sat down at her table. I pointed out that she was being rude for wearing white and for following the bride around while showing off her dress to all the guests. M supported me by agreeing and saying the bride must feel extremely bothered that her guest was trying to ruin her special day. The girl seemed shocked for a bit and said sorry, she didn’t know, and the bride didn’t say anything, so she thought it was okay. I told her that the bride was kind enough to let her stay, cause if I were the bride, she would’ve been kicked out right when she walked through the door in that dress. M said a few more things then we left. I thought my action was justified and felt kind of proud for sticking up for my friend. For the rest of the night, I sometimes looked over the girl’s table and noticed that she didn’t leave her seat until after the wedding was over, and she left with the bride.
 
I contacted the bride a few days after the wedding to thank her for the wedding gifts and for inviting me to her wedding. Then I brought up the girl and asked if my friend was bothered by her at all. To my surprise, she didn’t and even felt happy that the girl did. She clarified that the girl was her niece who flew from another country to attend her wedding and that the dress she was wearing was a gift from my friend herself. The niece even sewed in two swans to symbolize my friend and her husband loving each other eternally. That’s why she was showing off the dress to all the other guests.

8,1dt8drl,AITAH for canceling internet service ,"My partner (f) and I (m) had a conversation a few weeks ago about getting better internet service and getting a TV instead of watching every thing on a dinky laptop. We talked about where it would go, size (32”) and it would be nice to watch things on a larger screen with fiber optics. I spent a fair amount of time arranging for cable to be fed to our house through underground conduit and next week they will hook everything up. I came home tonight with a TV that was on sale at Best Buy ($80). She was pissed and seemingly doesn’t want one. I said I’ll return it and cancel the internet. She said don’t cancel it she wants better internet. AITAH if I cancel the internet? It’s $45 more per month than the crappy internet we have now and watching on a laptop is straining my eyes.

9,1dt8cx3,AITAH for not saying happy birthday to my cousin?,"recently my mom has been calling me a lot. I have been down to answer (I haven’t seen her IRL for a few days because she’s in Virginia) so I’ve been talking with her for a few hours. Today was a bit different though.

When I answered she looked a bit annoyed. I asked her if she was okay and we started to talk. She seemed off. Towards the end of the call, she mentioned that my cousin said I didn’t say happy birthday to him. 

Let me explain:

One of our cousins lives with us because he got an internship near where we live. I was fine with this because I thought it wouldn’t really affect me. A few years go by and I start to realize that he isn’t as nice as I thought he would be.
Recently, ever since I got back from California, he has been really bitchy. It got worse when my mom left for VA. Apparently he has been sending videos of my pet birds being ‘poorly fed’ and ‘not having clean water’ which is simply not true because I litteraly change it TWICE A DAY.
My Grandma recently sent him a Birthday card. I was tasked to go get it for him at the mail box.
I had to go quickly and give it to him fast because I had plans with my friends and was already late.

This was yesterday. I thought it wouldn’t be as big of a deal as it would turn out to be. 

Today the whole ordeal happened. I explained to her that I was on a rush and that I didn’t get the chance to say happy birthday because I was focused on getting to my friends house ASAP. She would go to tell me another story. Apperently I was ‘very rude’ and basically threw the letter at him. I’m surprised she believed HIM because according to litteraly everyone I know, I am one of the nicest people they know. When I tried to explain it again she just hung up on me.

I tried calling her 4 other times but she kept hanging up.

I don’t know when this guy turned on me, but whatever his plan is, I *dont* like it. 

My dad just got home and I explained this whole situation to him. He obviously sided with me and started to talk about how my cousin has ALSO been off around him for whatever reason.

My mom apparently told him the whole bird food and water ordeal. My dad told me in the morning to take videos of me resupplying them. He didn’t tell me why and the time, but he just told me to send them to her as proof that I do in fact take care of them. 

He later told me about the videos being sent to her.

Me and my dad honestly have no idea what the fuck to do. Do y’all have any suggestions? :/",Not the A-hole,2024-07-02,"AITAH for not saying happy birthday to my cousin? recently my mom has been calling me a lot.
