0,1duel0b,UPDATE: AITA for telling my wife to mind her business,"[Original Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dqtkl9/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_mind_her_business/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Tl:Dr: My wife found out our babysitter, Atlas, was non-binary and asked some overly invasive questions about him, which shocked me and made me snap at at her. 

This wasn't really a dramatic/difficult situation to resolve, thank you for the affirmation and correction on my language. 

Less than a day after this was posted I talked it through with my wife, and she agreed that she was in the wrong, and offered to apologise to Atlas, but I didn't think it was a good idea to tell Atlas about our conversation, so that wasn't a concern.

Some of you guys were quick to judgements, which is understandable but no I am not an abuser and my wife is not a bigot. She told me this was new to her, and she was surprised because she'd had an image in her head of what trans people look like and Atlas didn't really fit that as they looked more like a cis-guy, and she wanted to know why, but had gone too far.

It was suggested that I ask her how she'd feel about someone talking about our kids like that, and this did make her realise why I'd reacted the way I did. I apologised for snapping and she apologised for her comments and for not letting me explain myself. 

So everything ended well.

1,1du1wyb,WIBTA for just going through the motions,"WIBTA for just going through the motions? 
I (28F) am in a relationship with my partner (35M) we have been together for 6 years and living together for 4 years. He has two kids (6F & 10M) we don’t have a traditional relationship as we are polyamorous. He has another partner (30F) who has two kids (11M & 8F) she and i get along fine. But lately the topic of us all moving in together came up. I told him i wouldn’t mind as long as i had my own space. Because of a rocky start with everything when they first got together. Now he has been telling me that it wont be the same unless the three of us share a bed. I have told him no to this and she agrees with me that we need our own space if we are to keep a healthy friendship. 
Now shes questioning moving in and is questioning their relationship. I am also questioning my relationship with him. As he quit his job to try and start up a mr fixit business that is not bringing any money in. He’s blowing any kind of savings i try to set back (mostly for the kids to have a good holiday) as this will be the first year either set of siblings have gone without it being with both of the bio partners and i know how much that can hurt as i was yanked away from family for a couple years and the first was so hard. 
Well I’ve put distance between him and i and just keep bills paid and keep food in the house and keep the kids as happy as i can while barely keeping us above water. He is telling me that I’m unreasonable in asking him to cut back on drinking because it’s the only joy he has in life. I asked what myself the kids and his gf were then. And a snippy comment saying he’s losing everything and everyone anyways. 
I tried to ask where all that was coming from and just locked out side (that’s where i’m typing this from) 
So i came here would i be the AH if just going through the motions of life till they move to their moms? I know he would lose everything if i did this as he refuses to work because he thinks he’s OWNED this break and that he should just be able to start up the fixit business and it fix everything. 
Ive tried talking to him and get met with comments like “why tell you, you can’t solve anything” or “talking isn’t action” and truthfully i just wanna done with it all. But no matter how many times i try and walk away I’m guilted into staying because of them kids. To the point he will go wake the oldest up and tell them i am trying to abandon them like everyone else. And then he leaves the room. Leaving to comfort the child and get them back to bed. 
I cant just leave because i cant save anything and my work doesn’t do DD so its paper checks and i cant drive due to medical stuff. So he has me deposit everything into his account. Meaning i have nothing. I am trying to think of other options but i feel trapped honestly. 

So WIBTA if i decide to just lifelessly go through the motions of life? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"WIBTA for just going through the motions WIBTA for just going through the motions?

2,1du1hev,AITA for telling my friend she was insensitive to my disability?,"

The situation happened between myself and a friend (Lana), both 16, a month ago. For contextual purposes, I have ADHD.

We were planning on going to prom and planned to meet at Lana’s house prior to hang out with some other friends. Lana finds out that there is an after-party hosted by guys on the football team. Lana asks if we would like to go. I say yes. Lana says that I was not invited, explaining that the football guys took issue with me specifically.

ADHD comes with rejection sensitive dysphoria and emotional dysregulation; I take rejections pretty hard and have always known that the emotions I feel are more intense. I deal with this by venting, talking out the reasoning and just letting myself feel all the emotions to then find a logical way of dealing with them.

I express the frustration to the group chat as a way to feel my emotions. e.g. “I’ve literally done their part in a group project for them and this is how they return the favor.”

Lana says I shouldn’t take this personally. I tell her that I understand but I didn’t want to shove down my emotions. This exchange happens a few more times. 

Lana: the fact that you are having this intense of an emotion towards anything should speak volumes.

I respond saying that “telling a neurodivergent person their emotions are too much and ‘speaks volumes’ is so insensitive” especially when I have a disorder that affects how I experience emotions more intensely.

Lana: all u have done is call me ableist, which is a gross insult to who I am and what I believe and you using it to win a petty argument which i didn’t want it to become is disgusting.  You jumping to the conclusion and using being an ableist as a way to shame me is, again, frankly disgusting. After this convo i’m not comfortable with you being in my home.

If it’s not apparent, this conflict is not about the after party. 

I privately message Lana telling her I will respect not going to her house and asking if we can meet up at lunch to sort out this misunderstanding. She conveniently leaves school at lunch and says “we can talk another time” without any follow up.

I’ve only ever felt this invalidated from my parents. Not having any other friends from school to talk to, I irrationally posted the definition of the term “abled fragility” on my story. I know this was a bad move.

Lana blocked me on every platform after.

Our high school is only 150 people and Lana has already spread this around despite this being a personal conflict. I can’t afford to not have friends at a school so small. Many don’t talk to me any more and I’ve been excluded by our friend group. They fear we will fight… Lana and I have not made eye contact for a month.

I’ve kept my silence on this ordeal. I wanted to apologize for being rash and ranting when but Lana spreading this person conflict between us to others is what really hurt me and made me change my mind.

3,1du185b,WIBTA for telling off my friend for ditching me & our friends on a birthday girl’s trip?,"Throwaway account bc my main is too personal :)

So this past weekend, 3 of my friends and I went to New Orleans for a girl’s trip & also to celebrate my one friend’s birthday. We all graduated college about 2 years ago and live in different places, so it’s rare we see each other let alone have a girl’s trip in such a fun place. 

When we were there, going to the bars of course, my one friend (let’s call her Annie) met a random boy and they were flirting. This is completely fine - she’s single and can do what she wants. But then she had us following this random boy around with her all night, dragging us to only go to the places he wanted to go. She then proceeded to publicly make out with him (which is fine it’s a bar scene whatever).

The 3 of us were very annoyed that we were being made to follow this dude around but we kept quiet. Then, suddenly she was simply gone. Disappeared. We tracked her location and she was down the road heading to who knows where. We texted her and of course she’d left with this guy she just met. 

She assures us that she’ll be fine, and she then turns off her location. We carry on with our night, having fun, and we go back to our hotel room. 

At around 5 am, Annie comes back - BANGING on our hotel room door. She didn’t have a room key & we also of course deadbolted the door bc we were in an unsafe city and are 3 girls….. 

Neighbors in the hotel were coming outside so confused what was happening. We were so annoyed, but let her in. 

In the morning we weren’t interested in asking her how her night went. Then skip to that night, she’s being really sneaky on her phone and makes us go outside and linger around by this one bar outside as we’re trying to leave. She keeps being on her phone and then calls someone. We go to our Uber and turn around and can’t see her - we look behind us and she’s there with the same random boy. 

She says she’s going to stay out with him (and his 3 male friends) and then asks us if we can give her a room key and LEAVE OUR DOOR UNLOCKED??? So that she can go have s3x again with this dude. 

We do it, reluctantly, and beg her to be safe. She returned around 5 again. 

We all have no issue with her wanting to have casual s3x, there’s no issue with that. It’s just the fact that 1: It was for our friend’s birthday. 2: We never see each other and the rest of us were so excited to make memories together. And 3: She expected us to risk our safety by leaving our hotel door unlocked just so she could go with this boy. 

Would we be wrong to say something to her about this? Are we wrong to be hurt? What would you do?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"WIBTA for telling off my friend for ditching me & our friends on a birthday girl’s trip? Throwaway account bc my main is too personal :)

4,1du0wo4,WIBTA if I testified against my ex?,"Back in 2015 I married my ex. We were not a healthy couple. When we were dating I left him several times because of how he treated me. Somehow we always ended up back together. I would like to point out we were horrible to each other. IMO no infidelity (only s*x outside the marriage happened on breaks or with a hall pass. This related to us both as we both had relations with people other than each other) however we would scream at each other and put each other down. 

He did hit me a few times (including punching my stomach on my son’s due date) and the final straw was when my brother was arrested for SAing my niece. A lot happened and I was emotionally raw so we took a break and I flew across the country to spend some time with my best friend. He knew ahead of time that I was intending to let whatever happened with my best friend happen. I never lied about that. I never hid it. He spent the whole trip using our son against me and trying to use him to control me (this was a first since I’d had our son his whole life and my ex had never been (or wanted to be) alone with our son for more than a few hours at a time. After I got home, my ex told me I had to “prove” my love for him and proceeded to SA me. I went to the hospital the next morning and decided to take my son and never look back. Unfortunately he decided my son was a perfect tool of control. He called the cops (and spun the break with my best friend to look like cheating. Because of this the cop didn’t believe my SA and sided with him) and threatened to have me arrested if I took him with. I only lasted 4 miserable months without my son before I came back to my ex.

This time I bided my time and when my son was old enough to potty train (and my ex refused to help) I was allowed to leave with my son to go to his sisters house 15 hours and several states away. I never returned. My best friend offered to let us rent out a room from him and offered to protect us if he came looking. He didn’t. Instead he got revenge by posting every explicit photo of me he had on the internet repeatedly (I had them removed twice before going to the cops as each new account held more and more of my person identifying info making it way too easy to find me). I went to the cops in my new hometown. They got tons of evidence and placed a warrant out for his arrest. However it was a no extradition warrant and he lived out of state so nothing ever happened with it other his mom (I’m super close with his family still) asking me to drop the charges. 

About a year later, we moved out of state and had to get permission. During this separate trial I asked about the warrant and they said if he were to ever be arrested, then I’d have to fly back and be part of the trial. It’s important to note that I was also told that because my old home state has a law stating that crimes against spouses are automatically considered DV and therefore I had no option to drop the charges. 

I found out today that life has not been kind to him since. Little to no job, no job prospects, no car or home or friends. Even most of his family has kicked him out. His mom (who lives in yet another state) got him an offer under the condition he gets the warrant taken care of. Now there’s a chance (unless he pleads guilty) that I could be subpoenaed and told I need to testify. His mom says that I can just not respond to the subpoena. I presume she thinks that he won’t get in any / as much trouble if I don’t testify. 

I’m not sure what I want to do. He made my life hell and he has fully abandoned my son but I also know he’s struggled and suffered the last 3 years while I’ve been happily living with my best friend (now husband) and our 2 kids. (My husband tried to adopt my son and we have a daughter together)

WIBTA if I testified against him instead of ignoring the (possible) subpoena against him?

IDK if this is relevant or not but I’d like to add that while there were 3 sets of accounts with those photos that I had removed, each account was linked to a popular non-US based website so the cops had no legal authority to take down that account. It stayed up (with my husband periodically checking on it) for years. He checked on the account as soon as we found all of this out and all of a sudden there’s no traces of the account at all. The photos were not blurred at all nor were my face removed. ",TL;DR,2024-07-03,"WIBTA if I testified against my ex? Back in 2015 I married my ex. We were not a healthy couple.
