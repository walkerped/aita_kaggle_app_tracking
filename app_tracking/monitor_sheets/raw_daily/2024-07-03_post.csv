0,1duel0b,UPDATE: AITA for telling my wife to mind her business,"[Original Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1dqtkl9/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_mind_her_business/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Tl:Dr: My wife found out our babysitter, Atlas, was non-binary and asked some overly invasive questions about him, which shocked me and made me snap at at her. 

This wasn't really a dramatic/difficult situation to resolve, thank you for the affirmation and correction on my language. 

Less than a day after this was posted I talked it through with my wife, and she agreed that she was in the wrong, and offered to apologise to Atlas, but I didn't think it was a good idea to tell Atlas about our conversation, so that wasn't a concern.

Some of you guys were quick to judgements, which is understandable but no I am not an abuser and my wife is not a bigot. She told me this was new to her, and she was surprised because she'd had an image in her head of what trans people look like and Atlas didn't really fit that as they looked more like a cis-guy, and she wanted to know why, but had gone too far.

It was suggested that I ask her how she'd feel about someone talking about our kids like that, and this did make her realise why I'd reacted the way I did. I apologised for snapping and she apologised for her comments and for not letting me explain myself. 

So everything ended well.

1,1du1wyb,WIBTA for just going through the motions,"WIBTA for just going through the motions? 
I (28F) am in a relationship with my partner (35M) we have been together for 6 years and living together for 4 years. He has two kids (6F & 10M) we don’t have a traditional relationship as we are polyamorous. He has another partner (30F) who has two kids (11M & 8F) she and i get along fine. But lately the topic of us all moving in together came up. I told him i wouldn’t mind as long as i had my own space. Because of a rocky start with everything when they first got together. Now he has been telling me that it wont be the same unless the three of us share a bed. I have told him no to this and she agrees with me that we need our own space if we are to keep a healthy friendship. 
Now shes questioning moving in and is questioning their relationship. I am also questioning my relationship with him. As he quit his job to try and start up a mr fixit business that is not bringing any money in. He’s blowing any kind of savings i try to set back (mostly for the kids to have a good holiday) as this will be the first year either set of siblings have gone without it being with both of the bio partners and i know how much that can hurt as i was yanked away from family for a couple years and the first was so hard. 
Well I’ve put distance between him and i and just keep bills paid and keep food in the house and keep the kids as happy as i can while barely keeping us above water. He is telling me that I’m unreasonable in asking him to cut back on drinking because it’s the only joy he has in life. I asked what myself the kids and his gf were then. And a snippy comment saying he’s losing everything and everyone anyways. 
I tried to ask where all that was coming from and just locked out side (that’s where i’m typing this from) 
So i came here would i be the AH if just going through the motions of life till they move to their moms? I know he would lose everything if i did this as he refuses to work because he thinks he’s OWNED this break and that he should just be able to start up the fixit business and it fix everything. 
Ive tried talking to him and get met with comments like “why tell you, you can’t solve anything” or “talking isn’t action” and truthfully i just wanna done with it all. But no matter how many times i try and walk away I’m guilted into staying because of them kids. To the point he will go wake the oldest up and tell them i am trying to abandon them like everyone else. And then he leaves the room. Leaving to comfort the child and get them back to bed. 
I cant just leave because i cant save anything and my work doesn’t do DD so its paper checks and i cant drive due to medical stuff. So he has me deposit everything into his account. Meaning i have nothing. I am trying to think of other options but i feel trapped honestly. 

So WIBTA if i decide to just lifelessly go through the motions of life? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"WIBTA for just going through the motions WIBTA for just going through the motions?

2,1du1hev,AITA for telling my friend she was insensitive to my disability?,"

The situation happened between myself and a friend (Lana), both 16, a month ago. For contextual purposes, I have ADHD.

We were planning on going to prom and planned to meet at Lana’s house prior to hang out with some other friends. Lana finds out that there is an after-party hosted by guys on the football team. Lana asks if we would like to go. I say yes. Lana says that I was not invited, explaining that the football guys took issue with me specifically.

ADHD comes with rejection sensitive dysphoria and emotional dysregulation; I take rejections pretty hard and have always known that the emotions I feel are more intense. I deal with this by venting, talking out the reasoning and just letting myself feel all the emotions to then find a logical way of dealing with them.

I express the frustration to the group chat as a way to feel my emotions. e.g. “I’ve literally done their part in a group project for them and this is how they return the favor.”

Lana says I shouldn’t take this personally. I tell her that I understand but I didn’t want to shove down my emotions. This exchange happens a few more times. 

Lana: the fact that you are having this intense of an emotion towards anything should speak volumes.

I respond saying that “telling a neurodivergent person their emotions are too much and ‘speaks volumes’ is so insensitive” especially when I have a disorder that affects how I experience emotions more intensely.

Lana: all u have done is call me ableist, which is a gross insult to who I am and what I believe and you using it to win a petty argument which i didn’t want it to become is disgusting.  You jumping to the conclusion and using being an ableist as a way to shame me is, again, frankly disgusting. After this convo i’m not comfortable with you being in my home.

If it’s not apparent, this conflict is not about the after party. 

I privately message Lana telling her I will respect not going to her house and asking if we can meet up at lunch to sort out this misunderstanding. She conveniently leaves school at lunch and says “we can talk another time” without any follow up.

I’ve only ever felt this invalidated from my parents. Not having any other friends from school to talk to, I irrationally posted the definition of the term “abled fragility” on my story. I know this was a bad move.

Lana blocked me on every platform after.

Our high school is only 150 people and Lana has already spread this around despite this being a personal conflict. I can’t afford to not have friends at a school so small. Many don’t talk to me any more and I’ve been excluded by our friend group. They fear we will fight… Lana and I have not made eye contact for a month.

I’ve kept my silence on this ordeal. I wanted to apologize for being rash and ranting when but Lana spreading this person conflict between us to others is what really hurt me and made me change my mind.

3,1du185b,WIBTA for telling off my friend for ditching me & our friends on a birthday girl’s trip?,"Throwaway account bc my main is too personal :)

So this past weekend, 3 of my friends and I went to New Orleans for a girl’s trip & also to celebrate my one friend’s birthday. We all graduated college about 2 years ago and live in different places, so it’s rare we see each other let alone have a girl’s trip in such a fun place. 

When we were there, going to the bars of course, my one friend (let’s call her Annie) met a random boy and they were flirting. This is completely fine - she’s single and can do what she wants. But then she had us following this random boy around with her all night, dragging us to only go to the places he wanted to go. She then proceeded to publicly make out with him (which is fine it’s a bar scene whatever).

The 3 of us were very annoyed that we were being made to follow this dude around but we kept quiet. Then, suddenly she was simply gone. Disappeared. We tracked her location and she was down the road heading to who knows where. We texted her and of course she’d left with this guy she just met. 

She assures us that she’ll be fine, and she then turns off her location. We carry on with our night, having fun, and we go back to our hotel room. 

At around 5 am, Annie comes back - BANGING on our hotel room door. She didn’t have a room key & we also of course deadbolted the door bc we were in an unsafe city and are 3 girls….. 

Neighbors in the hotel were coming outside so confused what was happening. We were so annoyed, but let her in. 

In the morning we weren’t interested in asking her how her night went. Then skip to that night, she’s being really sneaky on her phone and makes us go outside and linger around by this one bar outside as we’re trying to leave. She keeps being on her phone and then calls someone. We go to our Uber and turn around and can’t see her - we look behind us and she’s there with the same random boy. 

She says she’s going to stay out with him (and his 3 male friends) and then asks us if we can give her a room key and LEAVE OUR DOOR UNLOCKED??? So that she can go have s3x again with this dude. 

We do it, reluctantly, and beg her to be safe. She returned around 5 again. 

We all have no issue with her wanting to have casual s3x, there’s no issue with that. It’s just the fact that 1: It was for our friend’s birthday. 2: We never see each other and the rest of us were so excited to make memories together. And 3: She expected us to risk our safety by leaving our hotel door unlocked just so she could go with this boy. 

Would we be wrong to say something to her about this? Are we wrong to be hurt? What would you do?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"WIBTA for telling off my friend for ditching me & our friends on a birthday girl’s trip? Throwaway account bc my main is too personal :)

4,1du0wo4,WIBTA if I testified against my ex?,"Back in 2015 I married my ex. We were not a healthy couple. When we were dating I left him several times because of how he treated me. Somehow we always ended up back together. I would like to point out we were horrible to each other. IMO no infidelity (only s*x outside the marriage happened on breaks or with a hall pass. This related to us both as we both had relations with people other than each other) however we would scream at each other and put each other down. 

He did hit me a few times (including punching my stomach on my son’s due date) and the final straw was when my brother was arrested for SAing my niece. A lot happened and I was emotionally raw so we took a break and I flew across the country to spend some time with my best friend. He knew ahead of time that I was intending to let whatever happened with my best friend happen. I never lied about that. I never hid it. He spent the whole trip using our son against me and trying to use him to control me (this was a first since I’d had our son his whole life and my ex had never been (or wanted to be) alone with our son for more than a few hours at a time. After I got home, my ex told me I had to “prove” my love for him and proceeded to SA me. I went to the hospital the next morning and decided to take my son and never look back. Unfortunately he decided my son was a perfect tool of control. He called the cops (and spun the break with my best friend to look like cheating. Because of this the cop didn’t believe my SA and sided with him) and threatened to have me arrested if I took him with. I only lasted 4 miserable months without my son before I came back to my ex.

This time I bided my time and when my son was old enough to potty train (and my ex refused to help) I was allowed to leave with my son to go to his sisters house 15 hours and several states away. I never returned. My best friend offered to let us rent out a room from him and offered to protect us if he came looking. He didn’t. Instead he got revenge by posting every explicit photo of me he had on the internet repeatedly (I had them removed twice before going to the cops as each new account held more and more of my person identifying info making it way too easy to find me). I went to the cops in my new hometown. They got tons of evidence and placed a warrant out for his arrest. However it was a no extradition warrant and he lived out of state so nothing ever happened with it other his mom (I’m super close with his family still) asking me to drop the charges. 

About a year later, we moved out of state and had to get permission. During this separate trial I asked about the warrant and they said if he were to ever be arrested, then I’d have to fly back and be part of the trial. It’s important to note that I was also told that because my old home state has a law stating that crimes against spouses are automatically considered DV and therefore I had no option to drop the charges. 

I found out today that life has not been kind to him since. Little to no job, no job prospects, no car or home or friends. Even most of his family has kicked him out. His mom (who lives in yet another state) got him an offer under the condition he gets the warrant taken care of. Now there’s a chance (unless he pleads guilty) that I could be subpoenaed and told I need to testify. His mom says that I can just not respond to the subpoena. I presume she thinks that he won’t get in any / as much trouble if I don’t testify. 

I’m not sure what I want to do. He made my life hell and he has fully abandoned my son but I also know he’s struggled and suffered the last 3 years while I’ve been happily living with my best friend (now husband) and our 2 kids. (My husband tried to adopt my son and we have a daughter together)

WIBTA if I testified against him instead of ignoring the (possible) subpoena against him?

IDK if this is relevant or not but I’d like to add that while there were 3 sets of accounts with those photos that I had removed, each account was linked to a popular non-US based website so the cops had no legal authority to take down that account. It stayed up (with my husband periodically checking on it) for years. He checked on the account as soon as we found all of this out and all of a sudden there’s no traces of the account at all.

6,1dusy1h,AITAH for not updating a distant friend group about SOs car accident? ,"AITAH. My SO (M, 29) and I (F, 24) were part of a friend group, but over the past 8mo, communication from them has dwindled. I’ve occasionally commented on their social media posts and messaged them to try to spark conversation but there wasn’t much interaction. Meanwhile, SO and I became closer with a new friend group that is more communicative and active.

Six months ago, during a local event, SO had a bad car accident. 2 of the 3 other people we were rooming with drove me to the scene, knowing I was too anxious to drive. Seeing the wrecked car before SO, I had a breakdown. They drove me to the hospital to be with SO and after being discharged he came back to the hotel we were staying at. I was busy caring for him and packing our belongings since we had to check out the next morning and since it would be the final day of the event. The entire room ordered Chick-fil-A as no one had eaten all day and I ended up going down to get it in the lobby once it was delivered with the same 2 other friends who drove me earlier that day.

During this hectic time, I posted a vague emergency update on Instagram saying I wouldnt be at the event for the rest of the day. I had too many people asking to meet up and I didnt have it in me to message them all individually. One of the old friends reached out, I told them what happened, and they asked to be kept in the loop. I forgot to do just that due to the entire situation. I have a terrible memory especially in high stress situations. SO later updated them because they reached out to him instead.

6mo later: the old friend group hasn't spoken to us despite my efforts to check in. One friend unadded me on social media, and after I reached multiple times with no response, I reached out to another. I learned they were upset because I didn’t update them about the accident. They saw me with the Chick-fil-A order (they were also at the event) and the two other friends and assumed I was just relaxing, having extra people up to the room, and ignoring them. They also mentioned I missed their birthday, though they missed mine and SO’s birthdays, which fall before theirs.

I explained I was busy caring for my SO that night and nothing else was my priority. I explained what they saw that night. I also stated that if they were mad they had 6 months to reach out and tell me. If they hadnt gotten an update, they could have checked in again. They insisted I owed them an update and an apology, which I offered, but they were still upset and didnt want to remain friends.

SO believes they are being unreasonable since he provided an update and doesn’t understand why it mattered who gave it. He feels we aren’t losing much as they haven’t been active in our lives, and our new friend group is much more supportive. I agree. It definitely hurts a little more than I thought it would.

7,1dusvei,AITA for checking my adult daughter's phone?,"Last night, I needed to put an important date on my calendar, and to make sure I got the date right, I went to check some messages I had with my oldest daughter, as we had been talking about it a while back. However, my son was watching videos on my phone so I asked said daughter for her phone. When I did, she asked ""Why?"" which made me suspicious. After all, why would she need to know unless she was actively hiding something from me? I found the date and went through more of her messages just to make sure there wasn't anything going on. All this time, she was pacing back and forth and trying to get the phone back from me.

She asks why I need her phone again and I tell her, to which she replies that I could've just asked her directly. Problem is, she has a habit of forgetting things like dates and I didn't want to risk either of us getting it wrong. She also tends to keep secrets from me, especially when it's something serious. This is the only way I can know for sure that she's not trying to hook up with some complete stranger online or buy drugs or something like that.

Turns out she had a Tumblr account without me knowing, despite the fact that for years I've made it a rule that all my kids tell me their social medias so I can check on them. She says that she just uses it to post her artwork. Everything seemed to be fine, though.

She says that I'm freaking out over nothing and that I shouldn't have gone through her phone, but I am the one paying for it, so is it really hers? I will say that she is an adult and should be given a little more leeway than my other kids. I am worried that she hates me for it though, since we have arguments about things like trust all the time.

9,1dusplr,AITA for not letting my friend text my best friend?,"I have had some issues with some of my friends lately, but things have kind of come to a head today when my friend (let's call her Blue) messaged my best friend on WhatsApp.

A little background information, my best friend is someone who I've been friends with since I was really young. But he lives a few hours away and I don't get to see him that often. We text regularly, and I talk about him somewhat often with my other friends about our shared interests.

Blue has been teasing me lately, saying that I have a thing for my best friend, who she hasn't met in person. A few years back, we called a few times and played some online games together, but that was the extent that their acquaintance ever got to. She made several jokes in the week prior to this saying that she'd text him, and each time she brought it up, I told her, in a light hearted tone to not do that. Apparently, she took it that I wasn't being serious despite me telling her multiple times not to, also claiming that I only ever told her once?

My best friend gets kind of uncomfortable talking to new people, and can be a very dry texter at first. So, when Blue texted him, asking if me and him were dating, he responded in a dry manner. Blue then got into an argument with him because she assumed he was mad at her and ""wasn't giving her a clear answer"".

Blue also blamed this misunderstanding on her autism, which to clarify, she isn't officially diagnosed with. Obviously, I know she is most likely not neurotypical as she has a lot of non neurotypical symptoms, but from what I heard, when she got the test done, it came back as undetermined.

My best friend got partially weirded out though, when Blue started to ask more personal questions like how old he was, what year he was in, etc. When I talked to Blue about this, she said that she was allowed to text him, because they, quote:
""used to be mates"". This is not true in the slightest, and my best friend has also confirmed that he hardly even knows her.

Blue proceeded to text us in our group chat, which my best friend isn't on, and said he was a dick, really rude to her, and when I again brought up the fact that asked her not to text him, she told me that I couldn't use that as an excuse for him making her ""genuinely worried she'd annoyed him and then refused to clarify for ages"".

Two of my other friends are backing Blue up, one of which is Blue's girlfriend and the other is a friend who I haven’t talked to in ages. Me and Blue haven’t had a brilliant relationship over the last few years.

My bestfriend Daisy lf 5+ years has been in alot of messy relationships this year (maybe about three?) But ive recently been open telling her i wouldnt care for whats happening kn her relationship.

Just for some context, the first guy this year (codename mike) completley ruined her and i mean it. Before they dated she never cared about relationships as mucj as she does now and she unrecognizable. She has a ""but he'll change!"" Mindset so it was hard convincing her to leave a man that was still obsessed with his ex and was one of those edgelords that would die if she left.

The second guy, (codename John) Just made her eben worse. She still had the same ""he'll change "" mindset and it was frustrating being her relationship therapist telling her why be with a man that makes u cry and doesnt listen when you can focus ln yourself and just be at peace? She didnt take any advice and always told me ""why did I even ask you?"" Even when she asked for it.

And thirdly (codename mateo) was just as bad. I dont want to overshare, but there was a reason they were broken up. So why get back right? Apparently this didnt go through her thick skull and she still went back to him even with how much he hurt her. She made fun of a guy for sayong something like ""you can read a book 1000 times and itll end up the same"" yes it sounds cheesy, but is he wrong? He was caught texting other girls and just said ""im not ready for a relationship"" and left. However when i told her to block him, she (again) said, ""whyd k even ask you?""

11,1dusjzk,AITA for joking with my bf?,"Hey everyone, I (26F) had a weird moment with my boyfriend (26M) the other night. We were chilling in my room, just finishing up dinner and cracking jokes. We had vague plans for some intimacy later, but nothing urgent. It was around 11 PM when he joked about being too awake to sleep, and I teased him about ""prime time"" almost being over.

Back when we first started dating, we had this chat about the best times for intimacy. I mentioned how most couples tend to get frisky between 9 PM to 1 AM because they're relaxed at home and all. He surprised me by saying his ideal time was before 10 PM. He likes going to bed early, and also that was just the typical routine in his last long-term relationship.

Since then, I've playfully brought up ""prime time"" a few times, including that night. He had laughed at the joke before but last night he didn't. I sensed he wasn't into it, so I quickly said I'd stop if it was bugging him. He smiled but didn't say much, so we moved on.

Later, I tried another joke—this time the ""gotcha"" hand—but he didn't play along like he usually does. He sort of laughed but didn't say anything and stayed quiet until we went to bed. Finally he said ""I'm really mad at you."" I was totally thrown off. He explained my jokes made him feel bad about his past relationship's struggles with timing and intimacy and he thought I was making fun of him for a lack of experience. He also said the hand gesture was me trying to make him look stupid and reminded him of times around his ex and family.

I immediately apologized, assuring him I never meant to hurt him. Hearing him say that I was trying to make him look stupid really shook me and honestly kind of hurt me to know that he thinks of me as someone who wants to put him down. However, I can't help but to feel a little...wronged? I don't feel like I was truly doing anything bad and I was just joking. But I also know that jokes can hurt. I didn't consider the past things he had told me about his previous relationship when I made those jokes. But I also feel like he'd been giving me mixed signals about how he felt up until now.

I only planned and made the dinner itself, and didn't have any plans for the cake. Despite that, my father got me a cake as a surprise.

Unfortunately, he got me a chocolate cake, which I dislike. It's not the first time I've gotten chocolate cake for my birthday, despite telling him multiple times that I prefer other flavours. 

I usually eat it anyways, even if I don't like it, to be polite. But this year, the cake was from the discount aisle from the grocery store, and it tasted stale and dry. I couldn't finish the slice that I had, and my father got very hurt.

He told me I was an awful person and that I did it intentionally to hurt him. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, although I can see how it can be offensive to refuse a gift.

16,1durofu,AITA for going off on my overbearing father? ,"Hi! I (21F) was recently tested positive for chlamydia and my dad (who is a pharmacist) only found this out through filling out my antibiotic medication at his pharmacy. He blew up on me and is saying that I am not allowed to drive my car (I paid half for btw) and I am not allowed to see my partner. I feel like he’s being super controlling over a human mistake and it’s been sending me into a dark place. I miss my partner dearly and I just need to know if I’m not crazy for thinking this is completely blown out of proportion. Any perspectives from parents? I’m trying to see his perspective but I’m having a hard time since he’s not even trying to sympathize with me. This has been a total nuisance.

Both me and my partner were std tested and both came out negative. My most recent test was mere months before writing this post.

Since I first turned 12, I began looking after my siblings so my parents could go focus on business stuff and whatnot when they needed to. Within this past year though, I have completely reached my limit. They have taken advantage of the fact I can look after my siblings and that I'll do it if they wont. It went from a few hours here and there to everyday. My parents go away on travels to different countries and leave me alone to deal with 2 other children as a child myself.

I live in England, and I'm in year 10 at school, so I have just wrapped up my mocks. Previously, I had been trying to study for my mocks whilst looking after my siblings full-time since my parents went on a month and a half trip to the USA for business. Obviously they sent financial support, and a family member would come round the house every few days for an hour or so to make sure we were all still alive, but I was still looking after these kids full time whilst trying to study for my mock exams.

I don't get to go out with my friends anymore or enjoy a nice lie in because I have to look after kids. This has slowly burnt me out over the past year or so, and even when my parents are home now they don't contribute in any way but financially towards me and my siblings. I attend their school events and Ray has started calling me mummy now. 

My mum and dad sat me and Amy down yesterday (the first time she'd spoken to either of us in around 3 weeks) to tell us my mum was pregnant. I immediately blew up at them, calling them selfish and immature because they're not gonna raise the baby, its just another kid for me to raise. This caused my dad to flip out on me and my mum to start crying. They left the house after that and haven't come home or messaged me since. I don't know how long they're gonna be gone and I'm moreso worried about the money side of things depending on how long they take because obviously the kids need food.

20,1dura7o,AITA for suggesting I work at Spencers?,"    

Today I met with a job coach for autistic adults. We discussed prospective places, like business i've been to and feel comfortable in. One of those was spencers; I'm friendly with the people who work there, and one of them even offered an application, though I couldn't make it at the time. That's why I chose it as one of the options. For context, me and my mother call my father the dream killer; everytime I hit a milestone, or want to do something, he always dismisses it, or tells me why it's bad. When he got home, I told him about my meeting, and he likes to ask a lot of questions. When I metioned one of the prospective stores being Spencer's, he got all wide eyed, and yelled ""the one with the sex toys!? and weed pipes!?"" I got very upset, seeing as finally getting the job coach is huge, as well as finally having ideas on where to work. I feel hurt and embarrassed... I want to work there because the local Spencer's has some nice people. I understand, it's not exactly a job that you tell your conservative catholic grandparents about. He's not even religious, but certain things make him uncomfortable. I just never considered it a big deal. 

update: spencer's isn't a hill that i really want to die on, it's just the fact that he focused on it. I get it, dads break chops. We talked about it and everything's fine :)) ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"AITA for suggesting I work at Spencers?

21,1dur3f4,"AITA for ""not keeping my word""?","Basically, I 16F had plans to go meet my friend this morning at a café. I felt ill and decided to do the steam thing where you put a towel over your head. My mum is a health maniac, and suggested something she read in a book: salt water. It worked fine but I was in a rush to leave afterwards. Then she suggested I go onto this tiny little exercise trampoline that only she uses and bounce on it for 3 minutes because it would have 'health benefits'. I said I didn't have time nor did I want to or have intention of doing so. She proceeded to follow me while I got ready to leave and pester me about this until I left. On the way out I said I would maybe do it later, but I left the house on bad terms with her due to this argument.

Cut to after meeting my friends and she continued to press me about this. I told her I didn't have intention to do this as I don't believe there to be any benefit and it also looks incredibly stupid in my eyes. During the day, I did other things for her like bring something back from the café for her and a couple other things.

Then at around 10pm she stands in my doorway and refuses to leave until I go do it so I can ""show my character"" and ""keep my word"". She threatens to unplug my computer, which could lose my work, and also to spank me. I just went downstairs and stayed there.

I realise I could have been nicer about it and should have worded myself better when interacting, for example by not ""promising"" to do this thing. It would have been easier to just do it but I don't understand why she was so pressed about it after so long. A whole day she waited for me to do this but by then I was sick of it because in my views she'd almost ruined a good day with my friends. And for me it is also about the principle, as she doesn't give up pestering people to do something she wants that is irrelevant and silly like this, unless in my case I lose my cool and shout.

She does this kind of thing all the time, latching onto one bad thing you do and ignoring everything else. I love her but I won't lie, I don't really respect her very much because she doesn't listen to things I say, take my opinions seriously and despite her denial and ignorance can be very hurtful and manipulative, even if she doesn't realise it herself. She's the same to my dad.

I just want an outsider perspective, and I can't trust my dad because he is biased against her.

I know I sound like and a\*\*hole but it is difficult for me to articulate how I feel about my mum and what kind of a person she is, because in general she is nice especially to guests but I don't have a good relationship with her because of things like this.

After my brother started college, he found a girlfriend and pretty much moved in with her within like, 3 months. I'd say he comes home about 3 times a week, and since my mom is super religious (one of the reasons why neither me nor my brother get along with her), she does not want him to be living with his gf yet. As well as that, he doesn't have a job so my mom keeps telling him how ashamed she is of him for leeching off his gf which just pisses him off even more since according to him, he isn't. I don't even know how he's been surviving tbh, since I know the grant he got for college isn't *that* much.

Our grandparents live half-way across the world from us, and we haven't seen them in a few years. At the start of this year, my mom started commenting about how she'd like the two of us siblings to go visit them- and my brother became excited at the idea of travelling without our mom... because he started having ideas about visiting our grandparents for a week or so, and then travelling with his girlfriend for the rest of the holiday. However, we haven't really planned anything properly until recently- and my mom told me that I'd be going alone. She said that it was because she doesn't want to be paying for my brother's plane flight, since he hasn't been working since classes finished and I've been working part time even while in college.

I'll be honest, I'm not super close with my brother either. When we talk, it always feels very shallow somehow, and anyway- I don't see him that often.

23,1duqvt4,AITA for commenting on my friends weight?,"Today my friend (F25) texted our group chat, mentioning offhand that her boyfriend is at the pharmacy to buy her an emergency contraceptive pill. We live in a Canadian province (edit: it’s Quebec, people! Look it up before confidently and wrongly refuting this.) where plan B isn’t available over the counter and must be prescribed (pharmacist is authorized to write this prescription, so it’s still accessible), but this means the woman must be the one who goes to the pharmacy to get it. Cis men therefore cannot buy plan B here. I let my friend know about this information and she immediately panicked because she doesn’t have enough money for plan B herself. (Why it didn’t occur to her that it would be the same if her boyfriend just sent her money? I don’t know.) 

She asked me how much plan B is. I told her it’s around $40 without insurance, but if you’re covered by provincial insurance (like me) it’s around $23. My other friend in the group chat offered to go to the pharmacy for her and claim the plan B was for her to save money because other friend is covered by the insurance. They agreed on that plan. 

That’s when it occurred to me that plan B is less effective for larger people, and larger women need to take 2 or sometimes even 3. The friend who offered to go to the pharmacy can’t be more than 110 pounds so would definitely only be able to get a prescription for 1. The friend who actually needs the pill is at least 200 pounds. My larger friend is very self conscious about her weight and teeters between being in denial about it and constantly putting herself down for it. I texted the group chat “the amount they prescribe will depend specifically on who goes in for the prescription”. That confused both of them, so I responded again and said “it depends on weight”. 

Neither of them interacted with the group chat for a while. The skinnier friend called me to let me know I “really hurt” the larger friend. AITA? 


Update; for anyone wondering about the weight/dosage thing (I can’t believe it’s become such a heated debate in the comments): she ended up texting me after going to the pharmacy herself where she was given a different pill from normal prescribed because of her weight. so it’s not necessarily 2 pills, it’s just a different stronger pill I’m guessing. Her boyfriend did pay for it. After she realized I was right about weight being a factor she realized I wasn’t trying to be mean and was genuinely relaying information. All resolved!

Update; for anyone wondering about the weight/dosage thing (I can’t believe it’s become such a heated debate in the comments): she ended up texting me after going to the pharmacy herself where she was given a different pill from normal prescribed because of her weight. so it’s not necessarily 2 pills, it’s just a different stronger pill I’m guessing. Her boyfriend did pay for it. After she realized I was right about weight being a factor she realized I wasn’t trying to be mean and was genuinely relaying information. All resolved!

31,1duoym0,WIBTA for not paying a bill i was never given?,"
Context: I'm in a punk band. We played a donation drive gig this past Saturday at a restaurant that regularly has musicians perform, but usually jazz/folk solo acts.

Shortly after arriving, I was told we could order food, but to tell the order to the organizer, who then relayed it to restaurant staff. I assumed this meant that either Organizer was covering the food (we were told there would be a ""beer fund"" for the bands as all the door proceeds were to be donated), or that she was setting up a tab. This is how things usually work when playing at a bar/pub. Sometimes you get a free appie or beer, sometimes you get drink tickets (would not expect this here, but would think they'd have some sort of plan/policy in place).

Myself and a bandmate ordered tacos (2 for $12), and I also got a beer (unsure of price but could be anywhere from $4-8). 

The gig goes by and I forget all about the tacos and beer. I got a non-alcoholic cocktail before our set and paid for it, as I ordered directly from the bartender (a different person than who took the taco/beer order). 

When I got home, my bandmate who had also ordered tacos messaged our groupchat around 11pm. She forgot to pay for them, so ended up calling the restaurant and sending an e-transfer with a big tip ""for the trouble"". I immediately feel guilty but also exasperated (at myself and at the whole night, which didn't go as well as planned, but was still fun). I hadn't paid either. I said so in the chat, then added ""I didn't know what was going on with that"". Nothing more was said on the topic.

Next night, bandmate starts messaging about the bill. Her e-transfer didn't work so she went in to pay in person, saying the staff were very grateful. She kept going on about it, how ""dining and dashing"" makes the organizer look bad, it's stealing, how the person she spoke to was too shy or not confident enough with her English to ask for payment. I can sympathize with that, but at this point I start to get a bit annoyed at my bandmate/the situation. 

We were never actually given a bill, or approached by the staff at any point with regard to paying. I admit, I got defensive. I didn't want to go out of my way to pay such a tiny bill that the staff didn't seem interested in being paid for. (Again, for all we know, the bill was already paid for.) 

Yes, I was being lazy and stubborn (not wanting to call them, especially after 11 pm), but eventually ended up emailing the restaurant, told them who I was, what I'd consumed, offered to send an e-transfer and apologized for the mishap.

It is now 4 days later and I haven't heard back from the restaurant. Today, another bandmate (who hadn't said anything before) messaged the groupchat out of nowhere: ""OP, pay your bill if you haven't. Makes the band and organizers look bad. Also bad karma"".

This weekend he walked into our bedroom and said that he had researched a policy he’d like to get, for 3 million dollars. He then says ‘I think I’ll set it up so half is for you & half for my mom’.

I am American. He is Cuban. His mother & the rest of his family currently live in Latin American. They do okay for themselves but the standard of living is a bit different from the US (though not crazy). She’s not happy there, and we’ve been trying to sponsor her to come to the US. I like his mom, and we have supported her in many ways such as paying for multiple trips to Cuba, paying to send suitcases/parcels with clothes/shoes to them, cash gifts when we visit, etc.

When he says this about splitting the life insurance policy something in my gut felt weird. I think it showed on my face because he asked me, and I said that it seemed odd to me. That it seemed like these kind of legal/financial things should be set up for our small family and that I would not just leave his family hanging if anything were to happen. He was defensive, asking why I didn’t want his mom to get anything. I wasn’t saying that, but I didn’t really have words to explain what I was feeling. I was clear that of course I would want his mom to receive funds if something so tragic happened, but that it seemed like legally this policy should be set up for me & our kid + future kids.

Round and round we went. 

My logic- say he passes away in an accident in twenty years, we have 3 kids, his mom is still alive & pushing 80. 1.5 million is excessive for someone of her age & lifestyle. For this example it gets split evenly between the three kids. A lot of money, but obviously you can’t do as much with 500k as you can with 1.5 million. I think it’s logical to say that cost of life & living for an elderly women vs for a young family of 4 is very different, and that different quantities of money should be allocated because of this. Also, I want to be part of this decision. Him waltzing in and telling me what he’s going to do doesn’t fly with me, especially as we are equal earners in our home & share finances so I am paying for half of this policy.

His logic- I should think of it as two separate policies. 1.5 for his family, 1.5 for me & our kids. That our kids will get 500k which is a lot of money. That 500k is better than nothing, and isn’t it good enough that he’s thinking of us and setting us up for a good life? He continuously accuses me of not wanting his mom to get any money. He also called me selfish, implying that I just wanted more money for myself. He says of course his mom would share this money with the rest of his family (dad, sister & nephews).

I don’t have great words for how I feel. It just doesn’t feel normal to me.

I recently got the opportunity to have a poetry book published. I wrote a lot of poetry to help cope with the breakup with a long-term boyfriend. I think the poems are beautiful and I’m very proud of my writing. I’m so excited to have my poetry published as this is a bucket list item of mine.

Some of the poems expose wrong things that he did to me (alcoholic antics, lying, cheating, etc.) Again, I wrote about these things as a form of therapy. It helped me process my feelings about the incidents that happened and this huge life change of a break up. 

We have a ton of mutual friends and acquaintances as we are in the same scene in our city. My friends have already expressed their excitement to read my book.

I can’t be certain what’s in my book would get back to him, but I can only assume.

I am so excited for this publishing opportunity. I am very proud of my poetry and it really helped me heal. Part of me wonders if he did these bad things, why should I care to expose them? Like does he deserve the secrecy? However, despite the toxicity, this man was in my life for almost a decade and I do still care in a way… like I hope he is happy and healthy sort of thing, you know?

35,1dunuq7,AITA for not telling my friends that I got into a relationship and for how things turned out?,"Last September, I started dating a girl but didn't tell my three closest friends right away: EG (F15), EA (F15), and AM (F15). I was afraid the news would spread and my parents would find out. Additionally, a childhood friend told her mom everything right after I told her, so I have trouble trusting people.

Recently, in a casual conversation about people we liked, when they asked me, it seemed like a good opportunity to share this. I don't know why I kept it a secret so long, but the more time passed, the harder it seemed to bring it up. That just felt like the right moment, but after I told them, they got really mad. We then talked on FaceTime, and I apologized for making them feel like I didn’t trust them. After we hung up, I wrote a message explaining everything (including what happened with my childhood friend and why I had trouble trusting them). EG said there were other misunderstandings, while EA responded that she didn't care about my apologies. Feeling overwhelmed, I avoided replying to their messages in our WhatsApp group, where they continued to insult me. This all happened on Friday.

On Monday at school, they completely ignored me. At one point, they looked at each other, then at me, and hugged each other as if to show that I was no longer part of the group. I felt excluded and humiliated.

The next day, Tuesday, they created another group called ""[my name] fucking answer"" where they kept insulting me. I finally answered, and after a long fight, we decided to end the friendship. This made me feel terrible for days. Even though I tried to keep writing in another WhatsApp group that included them + four other classmates (SB(F15), AR(F16), AV(F16), and SG(F15)), they all kept ignoring me. I suspected that EG, EA, and AM had talked badly about me to the others, confirming my fear that I shouldn't have trusted them. Additionally, every time I wrote something in the group, EG responded with immature stickers that looked down on me or insulted me. After a couple of weeks, AV removed me from the group, further confirming my suspicions.

Now I'm worried about the next school year. I basically only talk to these girls in my class and I fear being completely excluded for the next three years. I'm even considering changing class or school, but I don't know how to do it without involving my parents, who(for obvious reasons)shouldn't know the reason for the fight.

I don't know if I'm the asshole for not telling my friends about my relationship or for how I handled the situation. Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.

36,1duns0a,WIBTA for not changing my plans to attend my sister's showcase?,"I (23F) got into my first proper relationship around 6 months ago. We're long distance so finding time to meet up with my girlfriend (also 23F) - we'll call her GF from now on - has been hard, and we take every opportunity to do so when we can. A month or so ago GF let me know she had a spare ticket to see Six the Musical in her city later this month that she'd booked over a year ago. She offered me the ticket for free which I of course accepted, and I booked train tickets down to hers the night before the show and I'll be heading back home after the show itself.

What I didn't know when booking these train tickets, however, was that my sister, S (17F) is performing (ironically, songs from Six) in a showcase the night I'm due to stay over with GF. I knew she had a show coming up but didn't know the exact date, which is where I think I might be TA because I didn't check before booking train tickets and could feasibly change my ticket to the morning after (albeit at a somewhat expensive changeover cost). However, if S really wanted me there, I feel as though she should have told me the date of the performance rather than assume I would be free. 

This has put me in an uncomfortable position. On the one hand, it wouldn't be impossible for me to move my train ticket to the next morning so I don't miss the show. Equally, S performs in many shows and concerts throughout the year and it is difficult for me to remember the exact dates for all of them, especially when she is bad at communicating them in the first place. It also feels unfair to GF to mess her around when she's booked time off work for me to be able to spend those couple of days at her place - she's said recently that she feels like S is somewhat resentful towards her and our relationship in general because S is not the first person I approach when I have something to talk about anymore. 

I personally don't feel as though my relationship with S has changed much - if at all - since I began dating GF - we still talk as much as we used to and I still make an effort to attend every show I'm able to. I've been at university up until mid June this year so I suppose S was expecting that I would be at every show from then until the summer holidays start, but I think she's not quite ready to accept that I'm an adult who's going through some big changes recently (graduation, new relationship, etc.) and her life hasn't been changing in the same significant ways, and she's finding it hard to understand that our dynamic isn't going to be the same as it once was even if we are still super close.

I was diagnosed with cancer about a decade ago and have been in active treatment (multiple surgeries, several rounds of both chemotherapy and radiation) for years, as my cancer has metastasized and is now spread widely.  Andrea knows this, both because of our conversations and my blog which I write to talk about living with advanced cancer.  Sometimes I will be depressed and I say so, most of the time I try to find the positive in things.  She’s often sent encouraging messages, and has spoken up against people who stress me out.  She’s been good with that.  She is, though, somewhat self-centred and unaware of the effect of her words sometimes.

Today she sent me an article about an actor who would have been our age who contracted a rare cancer and succumbed to it shortly after diagnosis.  Then she added the comment “next time you feel sorry for yourself, read this.  You’re fortunate to have good medical help.”  That hurt.  I sent her a reply saying that she was insensitive and please don’t do that again.  I explained that the article was fine, it was the editorial comment after that was hurtful.

43,1dumvgh,AITA for refusing to support my autistic sister ,"i (21) have 2 sisters, (15) and (12). the last few years she's (12yo)  been seen by therapists for autism and adhd and as she gets older it's getting worse.

i should note that im on the NHS waiting list to be seen about an ADHD diagnosis and probably will not be seen for another 3-4 years.

my sister was already difficult to deal with as she's 12 and is just a typical teenage girl. because of her autism she finds it difficult to regulate emotions and often does lash out so we've been making an effort to be lenient towards her mood swings as we know she's already struggling with this worsening condition she doesn't fully understand.

but i feel like she's now taking advantage of that fact and is playing on everyone to get out of chores and get away with general bitchy behaviour.

 any time i stepped out of line or refused to do chores i would have been grounded and had my electronics confiscated.  with my sister she can flat out say no to chores because she's tired and yell and scream because she's overstimulated and nothing is done. If her phone or tablet is taken away she gets it back not even an hour later because she screams and cries so much my parents just give up.


recently i've reached a breaking point with her and i physically can't bring myself to put up with her anymore. she never listens to what i ask of her when i'm taking care of my sisters for the day. she insults me, yells at me and flat out ignores me.


the most recent example of this was earlier today when we had to be out of the house by 8am and she was still in her pjs at that time. i shouted at her and when she gave me cheek i shouted at her again. 

my sister cried to my mum that she's struggling and thinks i hate her and i was told to listen to her explanation and tell her that i didn't hate her. it should be obvious that i don’t hate my sister, i would do anything for her but i was still incredibly annoyed at the build up of her attitude and meanness towards me and did not want to listen to what was being said. 

my mum told me i was acting childish, explaining to me that whenever my sister is asked to do things she freezes up and her body shuts down which is why she wasn't ready and why she won't do chores when asked to. ""it's another symptom of the ADHD"" my mum told me but i already knew that as it's a symptom i deal with and one of the reasons i'm seeking a diagnosis.


Whenever i was 12, my sisters age, and didn't do chores and explained the exact same reasoning i was shouted at and grounded.


i know my sister is struggling and is having a hard time with her self esteem and social life and she's slowly losing her friends due to severe panic attacks and lack of energy to  meet with them.


and at the same time i don't want to hear my sister out until she stops being so mean to me, regardless of her autism, as i feel it's becoming an excuse for her bratty and mean behaviour. my mum says i should act my age and apologise for yelling at her.

Me (35 F) and my husband (42 M) have been married for 5 years and we have a now 2 year old daughter together.  Our families are very supportive and involved in our lives.

I have a small family, just my parents and my Grandma who live down the street from me.  My husband’s family is much larger and still lives in town.  We normally see my family more because of being on the same street and they watch our daughter 1-2 times a week and often help with our house and last minute issues which we are very thankful for and blessed to have.   My husbands family we see every month or so, give or take, for one reason or another.  Basically, my family gets quantity time and my husbands family gets quality time.

For big holidays we usually go back and forth between families, but for small holidays it’s up for grabs with whoever asks first.  The problem is, my family usually does and we plan something then receive an invitation a day or two before the holiday from his family.  Normally, I try to change plans with my family because they are smaller and that allows us to see everyone.  However, this is becoming a problem as my family is feeling like they are on the back burner.  In turn, my husband feels like if we don’t switch then his family goes without, especially since we see my family all the time.  I try hard to plan ahead and hold the best day or time I think his family would want something, but it doesn’t always work and we end up in the same spot.  This ends up making me feel frustrated because either way, someone will be upset.

For this upcoming holiday the usual song and dance happened, and although we haven’t seen his family in a few months, I don’t want to reschedule on my family this time.

46,1dummrs,AITA for telling an employee (and friend) that her coworkers accused her of stealing,"Alright so I have an employee who has been working for me for about two years now. Being that I see her pretty much every day I’ve grown to know her pretty well and I think I’ve gotten a good idea about the type of person she is. I could go through all of the reasons why I trust in her character but in general she has just proven to be an honest and reliable person.

Every day before work I spend a few hours (doing work) at the coffee shop across from my business and I’ve also become friends with all of the workers there. My employee as of two months ago also got a job there in the mornings for a couple days a week. Off the bat she started having issues with two of the people who work there in the mornings. I’ve had both my employee and the workers from the coffee shop explain their frustrations to me but I’ve never said anything about it to anyone. 

The other day I was doing work at the coffee shop and I start to overhear the two workers talking to each other about the other people in the business and the things they don’t like about them. Of course they end up talking about my employee and all of the things they don’t like about her. They were talking loud enough for all of the customers to hear the frankly… rude things they were saying about all of the other workers.

Now normally I’d just leave it alone but they started saying how my employee was stealing money from the tip jar and the cash drawer. I kept trying to ignore what they were saying but this went on for about 45 minutes in front of everyone in the shop. So I packed up my computer and as I was leaving I approached them and said that my employee wasn’t the type of person to steal from them. It rubbed me the wrong way because at a certain point it becomes an actual issue rather than just gossip.

So here’s where I’m not sure if I’m the asshole. I texted my employee saying that I don’t think she should work there anymore. She asked me why and I said it’s just not a good environment for her. She kept asking questions and eventually I told her that two of the workers are saying you stole from them and that I’m worried it could become a bigger problem. 

Anyway she confronted them about it and tried to clear things up; long story short she’s going to keep working there. The only reason I said anything is because I wouldn’t feel right knowing that she’s going to work everyday with people who are saying outright malicious things towards her that could be harmful to her and her career.

49,1dumayx,AITA for telling my brother and SIL to respect my nephew's wishes?,"When my brother and SIL met, my brother was a widower with a 6 year old son. My late SIL passed away after having cancer for 3 years. My nephew remembers her but he remembers the unwell version of her, not the woman she was before. She was very sick, but she always made time for my nephew and tried to pack as much into her final years as she could with him. Even if it was just snuggling up in bed and watching movies together.

Late SILs family were all very accepting and happy for my brother when he met SIL. They have a positive relationship with SIL and they see each other frequently. My family and I all get along great with SIL.

With all this, most people, especially my brother and SIL, expected my nephew to call SIL mom eventually. They expected him to be open to adoption. Even more when SIL and my brother had two more children together. But my nephew still calls her ""Sarah"" and he introduces her as his stepmom to others. When they asked him about SIL adopting him, he said no.

For two years now my brother and SIL have twisted themselves up a lot about this. My nephew is 15 now. They asked him first when he was 8. It's not just his no to adoption but also the fact he never calls her mom. Never even slipped and said it once. When he says mom he means my late SIL. She is the only mom he talks about. If he talks about SIL she's either her name or stepmom.

Some family members have asked him about this and have tried to encourage him to call SIL mom and to consider the adoption. They have told him how amazing and special it would be, how his mom would have wanted that for him. But his opinion has not changed. My brother and SIL went to therapy with my nephew and the therapist encouraged them to accept what my nephew wants and to end this campaign for adoption and the name mom to be used.

I talked to my nephew a few weeks ago and he told me he hates how much of a debate this has turned into. He told me none of the family listens and while his mom's side don't push him, they have told him they wouldn't be angry at him if he decides to be adopted or to start calling SIL mom. He explained nobody told him SIL isn't his mom, it's just how *he* feels. He told me he still loves her. But he sees her in a different way to his parents. So when my brother and SIL brought the topic up to me and my husband during lunch last week and they asked where they went from here, I told them to respect my nephew's wishes. I told them everyone would be happier if they stopped stressing about this. That they have a good life. They don't need the ribbon on top. They told me it was easy for me to say, I wasn't the person who felt my heart break every time my nephew says no or calls SIL by her name.

My brother and SIL went to therapy with my nephew and the therapist encouraged them to accept what my nephew wants and to end this campaign for adoption and the name mom to be used.

I talked to my nephew a few weeks ago and he told me he hates how much of a debate this has turned into. He told me none of the family listens and while his mom's side don't push him, they have told him they wouldn't be angry at him if he decides to be adopted or to start calling SIL mom. He explained nobody told him SIL isn't his mom, it's just how *he* feels. He told me he still loves her. But he sees her in a different way to his parents. So when my brother and SIL brought the topic up to me and my husband during lunch last week and they asked where they went from here, I told them to respect my nephew's wishes. I told them everyone would be happier if they stopped stressing about this. That they have a good life. They don't need the ribbon on top. They told me it was easy for me to say, I wasn't the person who felt my heart break every time my nephew says no or calls SIL by her name.

50,1dum3vu,AITA For telling my SIL to stay home from a family 4th of July gathering if her dog hates fireworks.,"Every year my family gets together at our lake property for 4th of July.  This year, my brother and his wife are driving here from out of state.  They haven't joined us for a 4th since before the pandemic.  Brother and SIL don't have kids, but SIL has a dog that she calls her baby.  Yes, she refers to herself as a dog mom.  

Earlier this week, SIL sent a message to our family group chat telling us that she would prefer if no one bought fireworks for this weekend since her dog is afraid of loud noises.  I'm not disagreeing with anything regarding the dog, our dog doesn't like fireworks either and he's a hunting dog who has been around gun shots his entire life.  

And since fireworks are expensive, we don't usually buy anything big.  We'll usually get the small stuff that just stays on the ground for the kids to enjoy.  However, the city that the lake is on goes all out on a big fireworks display.  We also have zero control over what anyone else on the lake does for fireworks.  The past few years our neighbors on both sides have developed kind of a rivalry to see who can get the best fireworks.  I don't mind because we get to enjoy the show without spending any money.  And they are also respectful about not doing fireworks late at night, once it hits 1015-1030pm, they shut it down for the night.

I responded to SIL's message with this information.  Basically, telling her that we don't buy a lot of big fireworks, but our neighbors do, and we have zero control over that.  She asked if it would be possible to talk to them about it before they arrive to see if they are willing to tone things down this year.  I told her I would not be doing that since they have always been respectful about their fireworks use.

She started to list off all the things that happens to her dog when it's around loud noises and instead of addressing all of those things, I told her that maybe it would be best if they boarded the dog for the weekend, found someone else to take care of it, or one of them stay home.  

This resulted in SIL starting a separate group chat with just her, me, and my brother.  She started trying to bargain with me to get me to talk to our neighbors.  Saying things like ""what if it was one of your kids that hated fireworks, would you talk to them then?""  

I told her that even if I talked to the neighbors, the city still does a huge show and we're close enough to see and hear everything and there's no way they are going to cancel a show because her dog is afraid of loud noises.  I told her that she is just going to have to find a way to keep her dog inside or drive the dog to somewhere else away from the fireworks until people are done.  

SIL accused me of being a bad host and for not being considerate of them as guests.  My brother sent me a separate message telling me to talk to the neighbors just to see what they say so that I can tell SIL I at least tried.  I told him I'm not doing that, but SIL is free to try when she arrives.

51,1dum191,AITA for how i reacted to a smashed golf cart?,"I (43M) often miss the mark with gifts, despite my efforts.

This Mother's Day, I wanted to get my wife (41F) something thoughtful. I chose three nice gifts, one of which was a non-motorized golf cart. She's taken up golf recently and complained about carrying her bag and wanting a cup holder for a beer or two while golfing. I found a good deal on Amazon and got it for her. She was pleased, and I felt I'd done well.

A week or two later, we went golfing at the city course across the street from our house.  As we left, she asked for a drink to use her new cup holder. We were out of alcoholic drinks but had lemon sparkling water. I mixed in some vodka, and she was fine with it...mostly just wanted to test the new thing out.

Halfway through the course one of the tee boxes is right by our house.  She asked for another vodka soda, which I quick made. By the end of the round, she was pretty tipsy. I guess I poured more vodka than I realized. When we got home, our driveway slopes down to the garage. She pushed her golf cart down the slope, yelling ""wheee!"" It smashed into the garage, breaking both wheels.

I didn’t yell but showed my disappointment, saying, ""Why did you do that? It's brand new and probably beyond repair."" I put the broken cart in the garage and told her she'd have to deal with it. Since then, it's been a source of tension. She often comments, ""If you didn't get me such a cheap cart..."" or ""If you hadn’t gotten me so drunk...""

While the cart wasn't high-end, she's not a serious golfer, and we're not made of money. They're also not designed for high-impact collisions. I didn't intend to get her drunk; I thought I served the equivalent of two hard seltzers, but I was apparently wrong. I don't think the drinks were strong enough to cause a complete loss of judgment (she functioned fine the rest of the evening).

52,1dum0nb,AITA for yelling at my friends and refusing to talk to them?,"I (15f) was friends with a girl G and a few other guys. Me and G were really close at first and they all treated me like a younger sister because I was the youngest of the group. I later met a guy we will call D, D was in college but he was my best friend and wasn’t creepy or weird to me. We had similar interest and he taught me a couple of things from our hobbies 

After I introduced him to my other friends though he started avoiding me and ignoring me. I was bothered because he would hang out and talk to them still but completely ignore me. He also got really weird around this time and only agreed to play or talk to me if I did something for him. 

Nothing too bad but still weird because of our ages. I started to get mad because he didn’t like me talking to any other guys even though he flirted with our friends and never really spoke to me unless he wanted something. After a few months of this none sense where he would go weeks without communicating with me I had enough and told him how that made me feel and he knows that people have done this to me before. I told him things about myself that I  never told others. 

He just says “Uhuh” and leaves it at that. I was pissed so I stopped all contact with him and told my friends to stop talking to him because he was evil, I told them a little of what happened and they seemed to care but still kept talking to him. I stopped talking to them all but two of them after that and they both said I was being irrational for refusing to be friends with the others just because I don’t like them hanging out with him and that they also want to continue talking to him.

I’ve asked other people about it and they all say either it’s my fault for continuing it or that my other friends had nothing to do with it.

54,1dullr1,AITAH for wanting my BIL (21yo) and his pregnant gf (20yo) to move out?,"This is the second time my BIL has lived with us in the 3 yrs since my husband, I, and our two kids (3 and 5yo) moved back to my husband’s hometown. When we first moved here in 2021 we rented from my MIL who had taken a contract job on the other side of the country with the intention to move there. She planned on selling her home if we didn’t want it. My husband and I had talked for years about moving up here when our kids became school-aged, and the timing was perfect. The only thing was that my BIL who was around 19 at the time still lived in the home. We had no intention of putting him out of where he had been living, so we moved in and just asked that he help around the house with basic tasks and whatnot. After about 6 months, we decided we would be staying here permanently, and we bought the house. We never asked my BIL to chip in rent. He stayed for close to a year, but eventually decided he wanted to try college. He moved out of our place and into his dad’s place (BIL and husband have different dads)near the local university. His college stint was short lived, and his dad ended up moving to another state too. Soon after finding out his dad planned to move, my BIL asked if he could move back in with us. I told my husband I was fine with this as long as he spoke to my BIL about either paying rent or helping with some of the home projects we’ve been doing. This was about a year ago. BIL has lived with us since last June. Since then, he acquired a new girlfriend, and said girlfriend has also moved in with us. About 2-3 months into his girlfriend living with us, they notified us that she is pregnant. Neither BIL or his gf have paid rent, and BIL has not helped with any home projects. I’ve struggled a lot with my health in the past year (chronic UC, heart problems as a result of UC, and just recently broke my foot). It’s been difficult feeling like my home is not MY home as I try to recover. All in all they aren’t terrible house guests, as they are mostly quiet and keep to themselves. When we were struggling with bills recently, my BIL chipped in a few hundred bucks when we asked for his help. TBH, I don’t believe my husband ever spoke with my BIL about rent or helping with projects (this is an issue between my husband and I).

57,1dul1oo,AITA for skipping my best friends 18th birthday ,"I (17m) have been best friends with Lia (18f) for around 2 years, since the start of our junior year. lia and I are going to college together, and I'm over at her place almost every weekend, she and I are like siblings and are practically inseparable. Lia  turned 18 today (July 3rd) but l told her that I had to go do something, because I did. There was a new movie premiering today, and I have not missed a single one of the movies in this series, it always brings me joy, you could say it’s a comfort series of sorts. It was very important lore wise and I felt the viewing experience would be best in theaters, and I wanted to make sure I wouldn't have it ruined by people posting spoilers, I invited my friend to come along with me but she said “no I don’t want to see despicable me 4 on my 18th birthday, why would you even ask?” And I was despicably distraught, she knows how much these movies mean to me and it felt really bad that she wouldn’t join me in viewing something I hold dear to my heart. 
I ended up telling her I was busy and wouldn’t be able to make it to her birthday due to a “family emergency”. She of course was very understanding but upset that I would miss her birthday because we had plans to go get her first tattoo, a memorial piece of her dead cat, whom I had never met, because i became friends with Lia after she had died. Also go paint pottery, and then go to dinner with her father, and then go axe throwing. All planned before I knew the movie would come out on her birthday. 
But earlier before the movie I ran into some people from school going to see a different movie today (we are friends but not close), we all said hi and made some jokes before going into separate movies. Apparently one of them had mentioned to my friend over text, that they had seen me and said hi, and she was pissed, I had powered off my phone for the movie and when I opened it after I saw she texted me multiple times, saying “dude you're an asshole” and told me that despicable me 4 was not a “family emergency”, and blocked me.
I feel bad for lying but she didn’t have to get that mad.

I bought meat at a farmer's market and it was sealed on vacuum (english is not my first language, so sorry if this is not how you said it). I used it the same day at night and it stank.

She said her mother recommended her to use vinegar and other ingredients, but I didn't want that, and put it in the freezer to return it the next week (I want to clarify that whenever she ""fixes"" the rotten meats, I don't like the end result, and it was 2kg to use).

61,1duk23p,AITA If I refuse to use my language skills at work as I was treated unfairly because of my culture background ,"I work part-time for a retail company, and things were going great last year. Even with part-time hours (around 55% of what full-timers do), I was one of the top contributors, ending up in the top 4 of the company and outperforming many full-timers. Although our bonus was small (I got less despite higher sales since it was based on hours worked), I felt proud and valued for my contributions.

One reason I achieved so much was my ability to speak multiple languages, including Mandarin. I love helping customers who don’t speak English, whether it’s Mandarin, Korean, or French. This made my part-time job truly rewarding.

This year, the company changed the goal plan. Now, individual targets determine our bonuses, and if we hit our personal targets and the store meets its goals, we get a fixed amount, which is a better deal than last year. I was excited about this fairer distribution based on hours worked and task orientation.

In the first month, we met our targets, and everyone got their bonus. We helped each other out, which created a great team spirit. However, when the new month’s targets came out, we were shocked. Some part-timers had higher targets than full-timers. My target was so high that it felt extremely stressful—I’d have to sell an amount per hour that’s nearly impossible.

Even my colleagues were puzzled and talked to our assistant manager. The explanation was that our targets are based on our performance and my ability to speak Mandarin. I was confused, shocked, and disappointed. It seems that those who work hard are punished with higher goals, while those who don’t do as well get easier targets. Moreover, my language skills, which should be an asset, are being used against me, adding to my stress.

I plan to talk to the manager in the next two days. Am I wrong if I decide to stop using my language skills and just perform average in the future if this is their way of setting goals? Should I ask for a raise if they want to continue benefiting from my skills, or request a lower target?

62,1duk161,AITA for staying friends with my ex while making clear there’s no romantic future for us?,"Basically exactly what it says. My (M28) ex (F29) and I broke up about four months ago. The breakup was amicable. No fights or yelling. Just me realizing she did not have the future I wanted in mind. With that, I decided I was wasting her time since neither of us should have to change our desires for the future. While we didn’t fight, she took the breakup poorly and tried to get me to stay, even claiming she would change herself. I noted that there was nothing wrong with her and her desires for the future. Because of that, she shouldn’t have to change. 

Since then, we’ve spoken and remained friends. About two months ago, she point blank asked me if we would get back together one day. To which I told her I can’t see the future, but from where we are now, that is a not a possibility. 

After that, I sort of diminished contact with her as I didn’t want to make her feel led on. We spoke rarely, with me always initiating. Eventually that boiled over and she reached out and admitted she loves taking to me. She was too nervous to message first. 

So now we are sorta friends again. I make sure never to flirt with her or say anything that can be interpreted as such. We mostly talk about work, movies and music now. We are never in a setting where we are alone together. I’m happy to have her in my life, as she’s my friend still and she asked me to stay. 

However, friends of hers have commented that while I’m not actively leading her on, my presence in her life is keeping her from moving on and realizing it’s over. 

I’m not sure if I’m TA for wanting to stay friends with her. Especially when she wants the same thing. When I diminished contact with her, she claimed that was the hardest part of our breakup, the idea she lost my friendship. And I felt the same way. I still care for her. I just know there’s no future for us romantically.

66,1duiu61,AITA/ for fighting with my boyfriend for going on vacation without me?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for several years. He struggles with addiction so he's had several relapses and jail/ rehab stints throughout our relationship and l've always had to be the one to pick up the pieces and also be responsible for bills. Last year, his dad offered to take him across country for a 10 day vacation, I wasn't invited. My boyfriend and I have also never been on any kind of vacation together, mostly because any extra money I had, went to help him or cover bills that he couldn't help with. It upset me last year but I told him that this year, it's only fair that we have a vacation for ourselves. Now his dad offered to take him on a trip across country for a whole month this year. My boyfriend said he's going to go, without any discussion with me and no trips planned on our horizon. He always uses the excuse that he can't afford to take the time off of work and can't afford to pay for vacation and that's why we don't do anything together. I can't even get him to take a weekend off with me to do something for my birthday. My feelings are extremely hurt for a few reasons. First, I feel like it's very selfish on my boyfriend's part that he's taking all of these opportunities and not even considering me or trying to find a way that I could also come.

My boyfriend and I have been together for several years. He struggles with addiction so he's had several relapses and jail/ rehab stints throughout our relationship and l've always had to be the one to pick up the pieces and also be responsible for bills. Last year, his dad offered to take him across country for a 10 day vacation, I wasn't invited. My boyfriend and I have also never been on any kind of vacation together, mostly because any extra money I had, went to help him or cover bills that he couldn't help with. It upset me last year but I told him that this year, it's only fair that we have a vacation for ourselves. Now his dad offered to take him on a trip across country for a whole month this year. My boyfriend said he's going to go, without any discussion with me and no trips planned on our horizon. He always uses the excuse that he can't afford to take the time off of work and can't afford to pay for vacation and that's why we don't do anything together. I can't even get him to take a weekend off with me to do something for my birthday. My feelings are extremely hurt for a few reasons. First, I feel like it's very selfish on my boyfriend's part that he's taking all of these opportunities and not even considering me or trying to find a way that I could also come. I stood by him through very difficult times, so that we could have a future together and I feel like I'm being left in the dust.

Before we got this puppy, I actually asked for a dog, but he said not in the apartment, which is fair since it's not a lot of room and there's already two cats. Well, two weeks ago I picked him up from work and he asked if we could get a puppy. A friend of a friend found a puppy abandoned And has been trying to find him a home. The girl who is fostering this puppy told us he was great with cats, well-behaved, and rarely had accidents unless he drink too much water after a certain time of night. So we agreed to take the puppy. Well, that was a mistake. This puppy can break out of his crate. He has torn apart his crate insert that goes on the bottom (which is hard plastic), torn up the carpet, and broke out of the crate and ruined the blinds in our bedroom. Not only that, he can climb on the counters and he got his treats off the top of the refrigerator and ate them all. He has torn a Metal bar off his crate to break out, pees everywhere and gets into everything. I am the one who gets home from work first, so I end up taking care of all of the pee Spots and cleaning up the mess he makes. This is very hard on my body since I'm in my 30s with fairly bad psoriatic arthritis.

For some context: My mother and brother both passed away in a two year time frame. One from cancer and the other from an overdose. I’m 23 female and recent college graduate applying for grad school. I’m unemployed-as per request of my father and sister. 

After my mom’s death my father has been especially on my case. I won’t lie he supports me completely and gives me a home to stay at. But the way he speaks to me about me sleeping over my boyfriend’s home and going out makes me feel like i’m a drug addict criminal. He constantly tells me i’m a fuck up and to be more focused on.. my grad school applications and yet never congratulates me on any of my achievements. I graduated college with a 3.7 GPA Bio major with chem minor all while losing my brother and mother- yet not a single person in my family cared, batted an eye or congratulated me. My sister even went on to say “Well you graduated late that’s nothing to be proud of” 

So finally today I ripped my father a new one. I simply said no body here cares about me and that we haven’t acted like a family since my mother passed. I began crying. I really feel like how can you constantly point out someone’s flaws, nag them and complain about them without encouraging them to be better and guiding them. Is that a good way to show care.

71,1dui3kd,AITA for interviewing for a job without telling my wife?,"I (26M) have had a few interviews with a potential new company but chose not to tell my wife (27F) until it got more serious.

Some background: I've worked at a large tech company with great benefits for the past few years, including an on-site doctor my wife loves. We've been planning to start a family in the Fall, and having that doctor during pregnancy is important to her. She's also reducing her anxiety medicine since it's not recommended while pregnant.

My current job is solid but involves monthly travel (a couple days a month), which isn't ideal for starting a family. I just got promoted, so I won't get another raise for a couple of years. Recruiters sometimes reach out, which stresses my wife out about the possibility of me changing jobs.

Recently, a startup that fits my skills and interests perfectly reached out. A couple of people there came from my current company, which helped my consideration. It's for a position that could lead to being a Founding Sales Engineer, and the technology's potential is high. Despite startup risks, they have solid funding and cash flow. I chose not to tell my wife until I knew it could go somewhere (I still have a couple more interviews). When I felt confident, I shared all the relevant information, emphasizing that I could drop the opportunity if it made her uncomfortable. Her comfort and happiness come first. I addressed the doctor issue, reached out for recommendations for other practices, and discussed job stability, pay, and benefits. The new job pays about $25k more with a higher base salary to bonus ratio and is remote with no travel.

She did not respond well, mainly because I kept it from her. She saw it as lying, which she has made clear keeping things like this away from her is lying. I fully admit this was wrong and communicated how I should have handled it. She's still upset, which I understand, but I'm trying to better grasp how bad a decision it was not to tell her from the start.

A little more context: She has had a couple of jobs but prefers not working full-time. My salary is nearly enough for us to live on as long as she does some part-time work. We have to budget heavily and have faced unexpected expenses like a dog surgery and a new water heater. This new job would give us more financial room, which would be nice with starting a family. Also, the on-campus doctor is about 25 minutes away, whereas we could find a different doctor closer. Not ideal, but it offsets that part a little bit.

The reason why I’m hesitant is that one: she’s married, two: several times she hasn’t paid the full amount she said she would pay back. I even gave her Christmas money early so she could buy gifts for niece two years ago, I received nothing from her for Christmas, so I feel unappreciated. 

I’m single, I just have myself to look after to. Even if I have spare money I think of things that could go wrong so I save it.

75,1duhrbi,AITA for wanting my roommate to help around the house? ,"So I moved in with one of my friends last year for university (I know never move in with friends it ruins the friendship). It was a choice of convenience as I cant afford to completely stay on my own and neither can she. 

So last year we had a falling out as she felt like I didnt do enough around the house. Keep in mind I have a semi difficult course of study and am busy from 7am to 6pm most days with practicals and classes. But even with my busy schedule I still made sure to clean the house and do the dishes as she never did anything. 

When it became exam time my time for cleaning became even less and I will admit the house became a little dirty (she still didnt help clean). When she became mean and offensive towards me (i hope that makes sense english isnt my first language) i asked her what the problem was and she said she didnt like the dirty house and that I should so more to keep it clean. I ignored her and continued with my exams. 

Eventually when we both were ready to talk we came to an agreement that we make turns cleaning the house and each do our own dishes. This didnt last very long and I was stuck with the chores again. This year, for university break I went home for a while and my roommate stayed behind (our classes differ). 

Her brother came to stay with her for the time I was gone in the flat and I think its safe to say no cleaning was done. I came home and the house was extremely unneat and dirty. I asked her if she could perhaps clean THEIR mess as I wasnt even around when all this was done. She flat out refused and I decided if she isnt cleaning their mess then neither am I.

77,1duhopb,AITA for not answering my friend’s calls after being diagnosed with depression,"I have this friend. Let’s call her Ellie.

Earlier this year, she confided in me that she had both depression and a panic disorder. I tried to help her to the best of my capabilities.

I have also been going through some personal things, and after 7 years I finally admitted to myself that I need help.

On Saturday, I mustered up the courage to ask Ellie “How did you tell your parents you need therapy?” (Ellie currently sees a psychiatrist) In the end, I didn’t tell Ellie why I was asking or what I was going through. I just told her thank you and that I would be in touch soon.

Eventually, I told my parents that I need help. Saturday and Sunday was just a lot of sleeping and crying. Ellie called me on both days, but I was too drained to answer the phone. Ellie also left texts, and I responded to those because texts felt less tiring.

On Monday, I went to see a psychiatrist. Ellie called me again on this day at around 11pm saying she really needed help and that it was an emergency. I was asleep at this point, and got back to her in the morning. I asked her what was wrong and how I could help. Ellie answered immediately. She had broken her phone and was wondering if I had a spare. I told her I didn’t and asked her how she broke her phone. She left me on read after that.

After multiple tests, the doctor told me today that my anxiety and depression scores were extremely high. 

I had promised to get dinner with Ellie today and I planned to apologize for not answering her calls and explain why I hadn’t been able to answer, why I had asked about therapy, etc.

However, at around 11, a mutual friend of Ellie and I contacted me asking if I remembered our dinner date. Apparently Ellie had invited her to dinner without telling me. This wasn’t the first time this happened and I was upset that Ellie hadn’t bothered to tell me. 

When I got to dinner Ellie wouldn’t look at me despite me sitting right in front of her.

I texted Ellie immediately after, asking “Hey, it might just be me overthinking, but I got the vibe today something was off. Did I do something to upset you?” She left me on read. I called her. She never responded.

Later, my other friend from dinner reached out to me asking if I was okay. I told her that I wasn’t and she was just the sweetest person ever. I asked this friend to tell Ellie that I was sorry for not answering her calls and for being distant the past few days, that I was going through something. (Since she wasn’t looking at my calls) The friend said she would tell Ellie.

I feel terrible for not answering Ellie’s calls. However, I always got back to her when she left a text. I was there for Ellie when she was struggling, and I feel like me asking about therapy was a sign that I was not doing well. Also, the fact that she got back to me immediately when she needed something but left me on read as soon as I don’t have what she needs leaves me questioning our friendship.

Last week,I (15F) was out with my best friend (14F)  and a couple others at a mall to go see a movie. I’d like to mention first that my best friend told me it would just be us as we hadn’t hung out outside of school in a while. We decided we would go see a movie and then go and get food afterwards.

Anyway,I got there and texted her to let her know that I was already there. She told me she was in a store so I went in to try to find her. When I couldn’t,I called her so she told me that she was actually in Mcdonald’s instead and that she’d already been there for ages. I thought this was weird but brushed it off.

I went to the Mcdonald’s to find her and saw her sat at a table with two of her friends. I walked over,sat down and they had already finished their food. I asked her why she was here with them when we agreed to do it just the two of us after the movie. She started giving attitude so I just moved on.

As we were walking to the movie theatre,they would all walk away without me even as I was calling for them to wait up. They walked into the movie without me even though I asked them to wait for me to buy my ticket first. When we were sat in there,they were taking pictures without me and sharing snacks.

I decided that if they were going to act like they didn’t want me there,I would go somewhere that I am wanted and that was with my boyfriend (who had to comfort me because I was crying about being left out). Also,my best friend tends to leave me out a lot. We’ve had arguments about it and she promises not to do it but she continues to anyway.

Now my best friend is mad at me for leaving to go see him. When it happened,I didn’t think it would be bad because of the way I was feeling. Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: quick update! She is now trying to turn my friends against me,spreading lies about me.

I also have frozen beyond beef fake meet in my freezer. I like it. I'm not vegan or even vegetarian but it was on sale and I figure why not have a back up meet option in my freezer.

85,1dugj6m,AITA for my stance on children? ,"I (20m)recently hung out with my friends Brandon, Jerry, Timmy and Hunter(not real names). We’re all home for the summer from college but Hunter will be leaving for a month to go out of country and will be back when his school starts. So we decided to sleep over at Jerry’s house for the weekend while we’re all home. Brandon wanted us to hang out with some friends of his he knows at his college just for fun. So we decided to go with him to a bar they all frequent and we were met with three girls. We’ll call then Claire, Diana and Jacky. So we started talking with with each other as a group and Brandon started to drink along with Diana and Jacky. Me and the other boys don’t really drink like that so we just kept talking. 

We were talking about college, our interests and just general life stuff. Then the topic of kids came up. Now this wasn’t a date or anything cause Jerry and Timmy have girlfriends, Hunter recently broke up with his girlfriend and Brandon likes to sleep around. The only single boys were me and Brandon and the only girl in a relationship was Claire. Now I did find the girls attractive but they were friends with Brandon. And no offense to him but outside of us he does tend to befriend a lot of wacky characters. 

So while we’re talking about kids, Jacky asked me what is my stance on kids. So I just said I can live with or without them personally. If I find the right girl and she wants kids I’m cool with having them but if she doesn’t I’m cool with that too. Jacky for some reason didn’t like that answer. She started berating me about how I should have a more concrete answer. Either I want them or I don’t. Then she started insulting my entire character as if she knew me.  I just kept telling her this is how I feel about it and I’m not changing it. We were obviously causing a scene with her yelling and me laughing at her so we all decided to leave. Me and the boys went back to Jerry’s house and were just talking about how crazy Jacky sounded. The next morning after Brandon had sobered up, he apologized to me about Jacky and said she recently broke up with her boyfriend because he was unsure about kids. So I said that wasn’t my problem and he agreed and we all went back to our homes. 

I thought the matter was over but later yesterday, I got a text from Jacky, Claire and a bunch of random people calling me an ahole for arguing with Jacky about kids and demanded I apologize. The three girls had my number the night we hung out cause I gave it to them cause I thought they were cool. So I just blocked all of them except Diana who texted me apologizing about them. I don’t care what they think about my stance on the kids but maybe I should apologize anyway because people keep texting me and it’s getting annoying. So AITA?

86,1dugh91,AITA FOR CAUSING MY FRIEND TO NO LONGER BEING APART OF THE TRIP,"I (F18) along two of my friends “Cherry” (F18 about to be F19) and “Grapefruit” (M19) 

(All 3 of us also happen happened to be neurodivergent with autism and adhd so please also keep this in mind)

Yesterday we had all discussed a day trip to the city for the 28th of July which happens to be only 3 weeks away, as “Grapefruit” has recently moved back to his hometown but really misses us so he came up with an idea of a day trip to the city.

We all loved the idea and agreed to it.

Today “Cherry” had done her research on hotels and found a nice one to stay at with the eliminated prices it would cost for all of us splitting it along with the bong.

I was thrilled and agreed to everything along with the prices as they all sounded good to me, however “Grapefruit” hadn’t joined into the chat until later so he was flustered with all the sudden messages of the hotel already being booked along with the prices.

“Cherry” quickly got defensive and stated “Yall are hopeless u always wanna do things last minute but yall gotta know we wouldn’t be able to go bc we wouldn’t find a place”, and that 3 weeks was the minimum which I completely agreed with her but also tried to explain as to why it may had been a shock to “Grapefruit”.

This lead to huge misunderstanding with her saying things in the chat such as “I’m a little offended tbh but whatever”,and “No ur saying it’s fine to book last minute which u seem more comfortable with”.

We both tried to apologise to “Cherry” with how we were sounding along with saying if maybe we could all just talk on the phone together to get things clear but it just got more downhill.

She responded with “U guys just need to figure out ur own stuff bc everytime I try and help I’m shut down” and “I don’t need yall fake ass apologies 🤣🤣 it’s chill I already cancelled it”

I then tried to explain that the apologies were not fake but sincere but that just got ultimately no where as she cancelled the hotel along with no longer wanting to be apart of the trip because she “wasn’t loving the situation”

I feel extremely guilty that it was my fault as this isn’t the first time something like this happened and that I seem to always come across a certain way. Is there anything I can do to improve and AITA ?

87,1dugdbo,AITA if I said to my kpop fan friend that her boys band singer crying bc his voice cracked during a song is incredibly stupid?,"Basically, she was showing me her favorite boys band singers. She showed me a clip of one of them crying because his voice cracked once during a performance. She said she was bawling when it happened.

I'm not into kpop and I don't understand how people can be so obsessed with those boys bands and idolize men they don't know in real life. I always try to tell her that it's probably an image that they have to put on, and they can be bad, cynical people in real life, so there is no point in idolizing them. But this time I got too irritated by the notion that a grown-ass man was crying because his voice cracked in the middle of the song. I told her directly that it should not be happening.

I told her that I understood the complexity of his situation, with whole Korean typical bullying and crazy fans, and their entire careers being at stake if they messed up. Still, I literally don't think it's so devastating that his voice cracked that he cried on TV, and my friend cried because he cried. I told her that in real time people are dying, children are dying, starving, and being tortured, children are losing their parents, and parents are losing their children in Palestine. I said this is real and this is a matter for which people should be crying over. Not because a singer's voice cracked.

I think it's absolutely insane how privileged a human being can be to be actually depressed over such little things, to go to the extent of committing the s word (I mean, I heard of kpop idols doing that bc of fans). I said to my friend that this is wrong and he should not be crying/being depressed because of such little things when there are so many heart-wrenching cruelties happening in this world.

When I explained my point of view she was frowning and was very defensive. She told me she did not understand me at all. She also started crying and when I asked her several times why she was crying she did not tell me. I left and told her that we needed some distance, and sent her a message saying we should establish boundaries in our friendship.

I think I ruined our friendship because of a kpop singer bro. I can be too mean and tactless but I always try to be gentle with my friend bc I know she is sensitive. But it's just so dumb, it's even dumber that I have to explain myself in front of her, and she would still act like I'm saying crazy nonsense.

Whatever it is, I still stand by what I said and what I think. I do believe it's a privilege to have the right to cry over pointless shit, and one should be completely obtuse and ignorant to deny it like that. Am I the ahole for telling her that? Am I the ahole for making her cry? I apologized to her immediately but she did not tell me what exactly made her cry.

88,1dufx4z,"AITA for kicking out my roommate, rehoming her cat, and selling my mattress & chair (that she borrows)?","My BF (22), friend (F, 24), and I (F, 20) moved in together 3/24. We all 3 wrote a roommate contract that laid out expectations and signed a joint lease. Our friend/roommate (Panda) has broken 11 of the 15 bullet points in the contract. Panda doesn't do her chores, lets mold grow on dishes she has left in her room, doesn't pay her share of rent (she still owes us 300 out of the 700 dollars we covered for her), doesn't care for her pets, leaves open food on the floor (we now have ants), and leaves for days at a time with no warning.

On a few occasions, she has left for several days without telling us when she would be back. She has left over weeks where we had to pay rent and she missed the payment because she was gone. She used to have two pets, but because she left for several days and didn't feed one of them, one of the pets died.

Tuesday July 2:

On Monday morning the group chat, asking for grocery list items. Panda was silent. I waited until Tuesday and tried again. I texted asking Panda again if she wanted to add anything to the shopping list. She did not respond. She usually gets home around 4:15, it was 5:45 and she still wasn't home. Panda told me that her situationship was in town for a few days and she was not going to come home until Friday. This is the 6th time that she has left for over 3 days without telling anybody beforehand. This behavior would be frustrating, but fine, if she took care of her responsibilities. But, she just takes off.

When I talk to her about how her habits are impacting the apartment (me, my boyfriend, our dog, and her cat), she says she is an adult and can do whatever she wants. I take care of her cat because I refuse to allow her irresponsibility to kill an animal. The cat stays in my room, even when Panda is home. The cat greets me at the door and spends time with me in the mornings and evenings. When Panda is not home, the cat tears up the carpet in her doorway, which I know is going to be expensive to fix.

I am at my wits end with this behavior and want to talk to our management company about removing her from the lease. She has only paid her full share of rent 1 time in the almost 4 months we have lived there, so it should not be too difficult to legally separate her from the lease.

Am I the asshole if I talk to management and remove her from the lease? I plan to give her a month's notice to move out. I’m reporting the pet neglect.

My parents upgraded their mattress and said my boyfriend and I could have the old one. We did not need it so we asked our roommate if she would like to use it. I want to sell it before she moves. It is not legally hers and selling it may be the only way to break even. I gave her a chair that she has trashed and I am planning to reclaim.

89,1dufol5,AITA for calling my mom a hypocrite and a liar?,"My (20F) mom (40F) and I have never been very close. She constantly criticizes me and gives advice I didn’t ask for, and this usually leads to arguments, but usually we get over it after a few hours. But this last one happened a few days ago and she’s still ignoring me and I’m wondering if I went too far. For context, my mom, dad and I live in a house my grandma paid off 15 years ago but doesn’t use, she lets us stay in it as long as we pay for internet and other utilities and keep up on the repairs. My mom has always been bad with money and constantly impulse buys things and goes out drinking with her friends, so sometimes she asks my grandma for help buying groceries or keeping up on bills, especially when I was younger and couldn’t work. My grandma agrees because she doesn’t want me going without food or power. I’m currently staying here until I finish college and eventually save up for my own house since renting in this area is expensive.

Here’s where the problem starts. Last week, a friend of mine had a birthday party and I spent $80 on a gift I knew they would love. I also was in charge of buying sodas for the party, and that was about $20, so in total I spent $100 for this party. I didn’t tell my mom any of this because I didn’t think it was her business, I pay for my own phone bill, my own gas and car payment, and I contribute $300 each month for bills and groceries, so I had already accounted for this party when planning my budget for the month.

A few days ago, my mom asked me how much money I spent on my friend’s gift, and I told her I spent $80 on it. She blew up at me, asking how I could be so careless with my money and how I was mooching off of her and my dad. I was fed up at this point and just wanted her to leave me alone so I said “You can’t be calling me a mooch when you tell your mom inflation is the reason you can’t buy groceries and not that you spent $100 at the bar last week.”

My mom stormed out of the room and hasn’t spoken to me since, and my dad is telling me that while I wasn’t wrong, I shouldn’t have thrown her drinking in her face, especially since she’s cut back since I was little, and her criticism is just because she worries about me.

Okay so I (26F) met my fiancé (28M) back in high school. Ever since he introduced me to his parents his dad loves me but his mom isn’t a fan of me, I tried to get along with her but she really nothing to do with me. One day we were over at my fiancés parents house for dinner to celebrate our engagement, his mom wasn’t too happy about it (as I expected) and as I was putting food on my plate she told me not to get too much since I needed to work on losing some weight before the wedding, I do work out a bunch like going on jogs and going to the gym, I am not by any means skinny but her just saying that really made me feel insecure.

Recently just went wedding dress shopping and I didn’t really wanna take her with me but she insisted. So I decided to be nice and let her tag along. I tried on a bunch of dresses and she hated every since one. I finally tried on a dress I fell in love with but she told me it was the ugliest one yet, I decided to go with that dress since I loved it, she told me no guy would ever wanna marry me if I was wearing that dress, I told her since it’s not her wedding I could pick out what ever dress I wanted and after that she got really mad at me and stormed out the building.

Right after I got home from wedding dress shopping she had decided to call my fiancé, she was literally screaming on the phone telling him to end the engagement with me, I was so pissed at her I had to walk to the other room before I told her off. A couple hours later I decided I had enough and I was going to tell her how it is, I sent her a message saying “if your going to continue being rude to me I don’t want you at my wedding, your more than welcome to come if you can be nice and respectful” yes I know it’s her sons wedding too but I don’t wanna be disrespected at my own wedding, my fiancé thinks I’m overreacting but I don’t.

A couple hours later I decided I had enough and I was going to tell her how it is, I sent her a message saying “if your going to continue being rude to me I don’t want you at my wedding, your more than welcome to come if you can be nice and respectful” yes I know it’s her sons wedding too but I don’t wanna be disrespected at my own wedding, my fiancé thinks I’m overreacting but I don’t.

I, 25 f, am the oldest of 4 kids. Brother, Sam 20 m, and sisters (Maddy, 17 f) and (Kiara, 12 f). I have been going to Renfair since I was 16, usually with friends but once Sam and Maddy were 13, I started taking them with me. Kiara just turned 12 a few months ago and said she wanted to go to Renfair this year. I was hesitant but asked our mom and once she gave the ok, I actually got excited because (very sad about this) Sam is in the marines and can't go this year because he is deployed. That is, I was excited until I found out what she wanted to wear.

Maddy and I have been planning and making our outfits since last Renfair (we are both avid seamstresses) and offered to help Kiara design her outfit. Kiara is really into Furries lately and has started making suits and masks but I made it clear that Renfair isn't the place for that and I was uncomfortable taking her in that. She agreed, we came up with a few outfit designs, and set a day to go shopping for all the stuff.

She then came to me a week ago, gloating, saying that our mom said yes to her wearing a furry suit to Renfair. I told her she absolutely could, but again, I wouldn't be the one taking her if she chose to wear that. She got upset and said I was being unfair because I was still taking Maddy. I told her again that Renfair isn't the place, and who I take with me is up to me. She's now very upset with me and is trying to get our mom to make me take her wearing her furry suit.

So... AITA?

Edit to add: there are several reason as to why I stated ""not the place"". Main being that it is still going to be in the 80's during renfaire and she wants to wear a full neon pink furry suit, head and all. Second, This is isn't a big renfair where you see all kinds of costumes. We live in a small town and aside from some tourists, it's mainly just people in our town. There's been plently of creature costumes, but nothing like what she wants to wear. We offered to help her do a fantasy creature type costume but she's doubling down. My mother isn't trying to make me take her, just said she was allowed. 
Also, I'm not embarrassed with her wearing this. I told her she can absolutely wear it next year when we go to comic con. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"AITA for refusing to take my sister to Renfair because of what she wants to wear?

I have a friend who I’ll call Clair, another friend who I’ll call Kate and a cousin who I’ll call May. I have been friends with Clair and Kate since late high school approx 12 years now. Clair, Kate, and May met through me and they all became friends too. We have been hanging out together getting drinks, dinner, mini vacation getaways, etc. 

My cousin May has the tendency to only hang out with certain people when it benefits her or when it’s convenient. Kate and I don’t let it bother us and just hang out with May less. Last year, May and Clair were once close and spent almost every other weekend together. Recently, they’ve also made many plans where May dropped off at the last minute to hang with others instead. She’s lied when asked why she wouldn’t show up. She only really hangs out with Clair whenever one of her other friends are not available. Clair and May’s friendship ended when we were supposed to go on a weekend getaway that was planned for weeks. May didn’t have the money to go so Clair paid up front for her and expected to be paid back. May found out the day before that one of her other friends had an extra concert ticket. So at the last minute May cancelled and claimed she was sick and having knee problems as why she couldn’t go.

Since then Clair hasn’t spoken to or seen May. This includes both of their birthdays.

My wife is extremely picky about what meats she eats, she usually will only eat chicken and fish. Red meats she refuses to eat or cook, which is fine.

Tomorrow is the Fourth of July and my family is having a BBQ. I volunteer to bring the brisket. Smoking a brisket takes 12-18 hours and the meat needs to be thawed. It takes about 24 hours to thaw completely in the fridge.

My job called me out on Monday to a sight and problems caused me to stay over two nights. I was planning to use the frozen brisket form the freezer but it needed to be thawed out before hand. ( I bought a 1/4 of a cow and I froze it so I wouldn't have to buy red meat for a year).

On Tuesday I realized that my job was going to keep me and asked my wife to move the brisket from the freezer to the fridge so it can thaw out. A task that would have taking a single minute. She told me okay and I thought that was it. 

I came home today and it wasn't in the fridge, it was still in the freezer as hard as a rock. I can't use it, so I go to the store and have to buy one.

I asked my wife why she didn't do what I asked even though she agreed to it. She told me she thought it was gross so she didn't. This started an argument. I am pissed that she agreed to do me a simple favor and then didn't and I had to buy one from the store. I told her she needs to pay me back for what I bought. 

She thinks I am being a huge jerk and overreacting.

101,1dubwkr,AITA for trying to relate and compare situations?,"I will accept it if ITA.  I only ask because I feel like my friend reacted overboard. Another friend of ours backs me up. 

Backstory: My two girlfriends (34/35 F) and I (43F) always talk about guys we are seeing. We are trying to have a relationship, but in hook-up culture it is hard. So we are always talking and complaining about so many different things. We have spoken to so many guys that we give nicknames to remember them all when we talk to each other.

On to the main story:  2 weeks ago, we were in our group chat and the ""new love"" of my friend A was being talked about. (She has a new love it seems like every 2 weeks, no judgment here though) She was telling us how he told his family and friends about her and called her his girlfriend. (Guys where we are tend to do that) She was semi complaining about him doing that because she told him that she was probably moving and she didn't want to do long distance, before or after the move. (They are about an hour away from each other.) Friend B and I were asking questions and telling A just to tell him the truth, which is that she didn't want a relationship with him. A claims that she did, but because of language barrier possibly he misunderstood. All of a sudden in the conversation A freaks out and talks about how the guy could scam her. I asked if the guy gave her any reason to think this or if was she just overthinking. (We all tend to overthink a lot.) She said she was overthinking. I said, ""Okay, well why would you think this?"" She didn't give a reason. She started saying how he was a good guy and she gave him her phone number, which she never gives out. She usually uses a chat app. He knows her phone number now and can scam her or write bad things about her in a post and it can ruin her. 

Now here is where I wonder if ITA. I started talking about 3 people she has known me to talk about. I told her they could have very well done the same to me, but didn't. 2 out of 3 new my phone number, and 1 of them new my address and work. The 3rd person knew my area, but not everything. The 3rd person could have done more damage to me as he had been scammed before. She told me it wasn't the same and don't compare. I told her I was just asking questions and trying to figure things out. She was making no sense. She got pissed and said I shouldn't have come on here and said anything, and then left our chat. She hasn't spoken to me since. I called her out on it today and she decided that she will talk to me if she wants to, but it won't be now. I even told her today I wasn't dismissing her, but just trying to ask questions or figure things out.

My other friend doesn't feel like I am in the wrong for the things I said. She thinks she was acting a bit crazy too.

So, AITA?

Edit: Apparently,  I need to clarify one thing, at least. There may be more later. Like any normal people, we talk about guys.

102,1dubop3,AITA for refusing to wear less revealing bikinis?  ,"For context, I 40F have always been on the heavier side my entire life  Over the past year I’ve gotten a personal trainer and have been going to the gym 5 days a week.  I’ve lost over 50 pounds this past year and I’m very proud of my transformation.  I’m in the best shape that I’ve ever been in.

So my three best friends and I rented a house on the lake for the week of the 4th of July week, which we arrived Monday.  None of us live in the same state.  So it’s a nice excuse for us to all get together with our families. ( Husbands and children ). So before this week I had gone shopping for new bathing suits and I bought my first ever two piece bikinis.  I had never had the self confidence to wear a two piece.  So my three friends are also on the heavy side.

Anyways so we arrived to the lake on Monday and we all got moved in for the week.  The house has a pool and we all rented a boat for tubing and a couple jet skis.  So Monday everything was normal and we spent the day outside in the pool, in the lake and on the boat and jet skis.  Everything seemed normal.  Yesterday was more of the same with no issues, until last night after dinner.  My friends and I were sitting on the porch talking.  When one of my friends made a comment like “ you need to tone it down”. At first I didn’t know what they were talking about, so I made a funny comment about nothing.  That’s when all three of the lit into me.  They said that I need to cover up and that I’m making their husbands feel uncomfortable.  I finally realized that they meant my two piece.  I asked what was wrong with them? And they proceeded to say “ no one wants to stare at your ass and tits!”  I was so caught off guard by this that I got defensive.  Before long we were in a full blown argument.  They were saying “ stop acting like a slut” and I replied by telling them they are just jealous because they are wearing one pieces. After that I was so hurt that I stormed off to cry in my room.  I couldn’t even tell my husband the reason I was so upset.  I spent the rest of the night in my room.  Now this morning, I’m the first one awake, and I’m wearing another two piece.  AITA or are my friends just so insecure?

103,1duahk9,AITA for being hurt that my partner has secretly thrown out my cigarettes when I've been hiding it from him,"My partner and I have been together 5 years, we met at university when I was a heavy smoker and he was more into drugs and alcohol. I would say that we were both a mess at uni and he was verging on being an alcoholic (I'm aware this is what most students do but he was excessively drinking virtually every night even if we weren't going out anywhere)

Although I wasn't happy with him drinking as much as he was, I didn't have a leg to stand on because of how much I would smoke as well. At first, he didn't express much of an issue with smoking, however a year in he started shaming me about it. Explaining that it was disgusting kissing a smoker and I needed to stop. He also said its sad if I'm choosing smoking over him. So I stopped

When COVID hit we were doing long distance and as I was living with my parents so couldn't smoke anyway. But as I began to work long days on film sets and photography shoots I picked it up again. Honestly, the main reason was it felt like I could escape social situations by going and having a smoke and it just became addictive

He eventually moved over to where I live and I began hiding my smoking. At one point I stupidly tried to hide it when I stank of smoke from a night out and again he began shaming me. He said he didn't get why I couldn't just quit and to say I was an addict was just a cop out. He also said I could go cold turkey for a good while so why couldn't I now? When I brought up his alcoholism and if I was to ask him to stop drinking would he do it, he said it wasn't the same thing and cigarettes are more dangerous

  
So till this day, I haven't been able to stop smoking and have been hiding it although he has got to a point of knowing I do it, but seems okay with the fact that its just not in the house or around him. However, I went to my handbag this morning while he's at work and my tobacco etc is gone. I looked everywhere for it but I wouldn't have moved it anywhere from my bag. I'm convinced that he has thrown them out without telling me as there's no other explanation. 

Although I understand his anger if he discovered it and I've not told him I've my own pouch instead of just taking cigarettes of people when I'm out, but I don't like the fact he's thrown it out and probably expecting me to come to him asking if he did so he can have proof that I'm smoking. But I do feel like the asshole because I'm the one that's been secretive.

104,1duaeq8,AITA for asking my dad why his stepkids and my half siblings are more important to him than me and my sister?,"I (17m) have a complicated blended family history that I should try to explain.

Dad and mom had me and my sister Kali (15f). Mom died when Kali was 3 and I was 5. Dad was never that close to his family but mom was close to hers and Kali and I were close to them too. Dad was not.

My dad's wife had her oldest (13) before she got married for the first time. With her ex husband she had two kids (10 and 9). During her first marriage she and her husband took in his nieces (12 and 8). Her ex-husband and his whole family got arrested and her nieces didn't know their father. So she kept them and raised them (with my dad). She also took custody of her nephew (7) while she and my dad were dating. I could be a little off on the timeline. This stuff happened but of course I didn't know her during most of it.

Now they have a 4 and 3 year old together.

And they've been married for 6 years (they only dated for 14 or 15 months and she started dating dad while she was in the middle of her divorce).

Of all the kids in our house my sister and I are the only ones with extended family in our lives, our maternal grandparents and aunts, uncles and cousins. Dad's parents didn't want anything to do with kids that weren't blood so dad finally stopped all contact with his family, though his family never cared much for Kali or me either. His wife's parents are dead and her brother isn't around for his son and the mother of his son and her family aren't involved. Her ex husband's family are all still in prison and the father of his nieces are still unknown.

My maternal family don't want to be involved in the others, just Kali and me. Which annoys my dad and annoys his wife and the kids get upset because they want to have more people too. They want to go to BBQs and grandparent sleepovers and cousin sleepovers. But just Kali and I get that. It's become such a huge deal that my dad and his wife tried to tell Kali and me we couldn't see our family as much. And they tried to take advantage of Covid by making us all do family things together in the hope we wouldn't tolerate the other kids being excluded if we loved them more than we loved our maternal side. It didn't work.

Dad told Kali and me recently he was putting his foot down and we were not to talk to our family anymore. He said he were a bad influence and taught us to close off our hearts to our family. He said he never should have let things continue this long. He said it wasn't fair to the other kids and what they're going through. I asked him why his stepkids and his younger bio kids are more important to him than Kali and me, why is their happiness and their wants more important. Dad told me I wasn't being logical or fair to him. I told him we didn't owe them cutting off our family for them. I told him he should be putting us first too. That we're still his and we don't have another parent to advocate for us. He told me I should show more compassion and love for my siblings. Not just Kali.

105,1dua55a,AITA for telling my grandparents they should have been better people if they wanted to be invited to my graduation?,"I (18m) graduated high school at the end of May. I had my parents and my stepdad there. My family is a little complicated for some so I need to give background before getting into the why of not inviting my grandparents.

My grandparents are lifelong friends. My two grandma's knew each other since kindergarten and my two grandpa's knew each other since high school. They always lived close by each other and they raised their kids to be close as well. My paternal side had just my dad. My maternal side had four kids.

So my parents were born 7 weeks apart and became best friends really young. So of course everyone in their lives started thinking they should be together and shipped them. But my grandparents were the worst. Dad knew he liked nobody though and he's aro ace, which means no sexual or romantic attractions or interest. Mom was the only person he told. She was understanding. They tried to assure everyone they were just great friends but the pressure built more and more after high school and when they were 20 they gave in and tried ""dating"" for 3 months and then broke up. Then they found out they were expecting me and everyone thought they would get married for my sake but they didn't and their parents were awful about it. My grandparents were weirdly obsessed with my parents being together and gave them a lot of shit for years about it. Like the more I think about it the more gross it seems to be that invested in your kids sex life.

I always knew dad was aro ace. They always made sure I was aware and would answer any questions I had. We were a little family even if we're weren't a traditional family and my parents were always super amazing at being my parents. I never had a formal custody thing with them. I spent time with both and could move around freely as I needed to/wanted to. My dad eventually came out and my grandparents, both sides, were awful. They said some truly hurtful and disgusting things to dad. They pressured him a lot to ""seek help"" and stuff because they wanted me to grow up without *that* in my life. They said he needed to do better by me.

Everything got worse again when my mom met my stepdad when I was 8. The fact my dad and him get along so well and became best friends too. The fact all three of them were so close. We saw way less of my grandparents over the years and I was glad.

Next weekend, he asked me if I was out, saying he couldn´t just let it be and stuff, I thought it was quite cute, so I started texting him. After that we meet up outside three or four times. It was alright, we got along well and he was very nice to me, but he started bringing out the topic of going to his place and having sex a lot. It was starting to bug me out. I tried to let things cool down a bit so that I would have time to think without being pressured, like I was not opposed to the idea of having sex it was just constantly being brought up like it was a given if we ever hanged out at his house. It also felt like a task and I prefer for that kind of stuff to happen without planning. So I usually rejected his 'chilling at his place' plans.

Yesterday, I went to the cinema with my friends and he texted me about going to his place after. I said I couldn´t because it was tuesday and his house was far and I wanted to be home early. He seemed to not like my answer and started being dry. He also started questioning my reasons for not going because I had a car and I should be able to, I told him that if he was not going to believe me that I'd rather end the conversation, he aswered somthing simmilar to whatever (we are spanish), bit more rude. I talked about it with my friends and came to the conclusion that it was best to go our separate ways because he was too immature. Texted him I did not want to hang out anymore and he said okay.

But it did not end there. He spamed me three or four messages saying that 'we should act according to our age', that I was doing things that contradicted each other and that I had to text him back like a normal person and talk about it. I did. He tried to defend he was not bothered about me saying no to going to his house and that it was all me, that I had gone paranoid. I said I was sorry but that I'd rather let things cool down a little bit and meet less cause it was becoming a bit overwhelming for casual dating, like we shouldn´t even be fighting. So he agreed but then two hours later told me HE wanted to rethink things, to which I answered: why not just let it go? I think we are clearly not compatible.

108,1du9mbh,AITA I didn't tell my best friend/boss why I was going to be late,"My best friend, Daria, runs an art studio. I teach a beginning art class as a contractor (1099, not W2). I teach three or four classes per year, each four weeks long. These are adult classes—most are 40 or older.

Daria and I literally know everything about each other's lives--we talk on the phone almost every day.

In the last class, we have a little show where friends and family came to see the art projects the students had made. It's fun! Daria usually comes for the art show, which is the last 30 minutes of a class.

For this particular class, I had an assistant, Jenny, helping me. Jenny is very talented, and Daria knows her. Jenny has been to all the classes and knows the students well. Jenny is a talented artist and good teacher.

On the night of the final show, I had to take my 20-year-old child to the airport before class. She is a frequent flyer, and our airport is small. She's also on the autism spectrum. Normally, this isn't a problem, and I've dropped her off at the airport numerous times without issue.

However, this time, I had to come in to pay for an additional suitcase for her. When I was walking back to my car, she called me. She was in hysterics. I could not understand what the problem was. I headed back to the airport.

We have a class group text, and I texted the whole group, saying, ""I'm going to be a few minutes late."" Daria is in this group and received the text.

I found my daughter and realized I was going to be more than a few minutes late. I texted Jenny and told her my daughter was having a meltdown, sent her a copy of the syllabus, and asked her to start class. She agreed.

I then focused my attention on my child, solved her problem, and sent her on her way. I ended up being 40 minutes late to class. Daria was already there (which is unusual—normally, she just comes for the art show). Jenny was working with the students, and everything was fine. I apologized when I came in.

After the class ended, Daria said I was an AH for not explaining to her why I was late and for asking Jenny to cover. I apologized and said my focus was on getting my daughter taken care of and I needed the class covered and Jenny would be there anyway. It honestly didn't occur to me to explain to her before as the class was taken care of and I needed to deal with my daughter.

Daria says I took advantage of our friendship, and if we weren't friends, I would have called her and asked her to find a substitute. Daria isn't qualified to teach the type of art I teach, so she couldn't substitute.

I also didn’t want to exchange money between family members etc. I am now coordinating her Hen’s party because all of her friends are terrible and no one has put their hand up so that job has fallen to me.

The couple intentionally booked their wedding day for the exact same date as my wedding a year ago. My husband (her brother) is MCing for them and I will be seated at the bridal party table for the evening so we will spend our first wedding anniversary working and won’t even get to share a meal together. 

I had thought that since I am doing all this work the couple might offer to pay for our accommodation (it’s a destination wedding) or at least pay for my bridesmaid dress/shoes/hair & makeup as I know they are paying for the groom’s brothers suit (I know this because I created their budget as part of this gig). All told by the end of this including the hens weekend we will be out of pocket almost $2000.

112,1du8wru,AITA: should I let my partner sleep-train my four year old in peace? ,"Hello Reddit,

My family is having some difficulties with getting our youngest (4F) to sleep. It has been an ongoing battle. 

She only wants me, and mostly rejects her father. He tries his best, but rejects my advice and wants to find his own methods. Lately he has been letting her watch cartoons, and he was very happy with that because he could use the number of episodes to pressure her into behaving and sitting still / eating her dinner, but even that is getting problematic now. Last night was gruesome. She was utterly refusing him and just trying to get to me, who was putting our eldest (9F) to bed by reading to her. 

She was crying and screaming for half an hour. He was also raising his voice, and toward the end being quite loud. He tried to block her in her room. 

I tried to keep calm and keep reading, but when I heard doors slamming and the crying and screaming just escalating I felt so sad I had to intervene. I picked her up and comforted her as he started yelling at me instead, angry that I stopped his methods. 

He thinks that if he leaves her alone in her room, she will self-soothe and learn to go to bed alone. 

After I put both kids to bed, I took some deep breaths and tried to talk to him when he had calmed down and had a joint. I tried to encourage him to find information on how to put bigger children to sleep, as from what I've read, neither cartoons nor locking them in their room seems to be very helpful. There are other methods that I try and use. He didn't respond to me. This morning he barely spoke to me.

I was with 2 males myself a teen and a preteen. I was confronted by the Dad for what he called my rude behaviour because I overtook him (we were all walking) in the parking lot on the way to the village restaurant. This is what happened. 

 I am a new driver and I parked first but had to fix my parking. I saw the person parked from behind me who came after me walk in front of us . We were all on our way to the restaurant. This restaurant had a fries section  and a sit down tables for eating section. The fries station takes long because they only start cooking when you place an order. 

At some point younger son noticed me running and shouted and asked why. I ignored him and ran inside to get to the fries section first and did end up ordering first. 

The Dad confronted me saying what I did was rude and that even my son of about 12 years old noticed I was doing something wrong and called me out.

 I explained nicely at first, that actually we arrived first, hence my car being parked in front of theirs. He lied saying they arrived first, and that it was rude and he is speaking up for his 2 daughters. I think he mistook me for a helper too because of a comment he made. I am a resident in the village where we had a confrontation.

 Anyway, I still tried to patiently explain that what I did wasnt wrong because they walked leisurely while I ran, precisely to get ahead. I said it was no different from when we were at a theme park and some people overtook us because the senior (person over 60 years old) with us walked slowly. I said would he have called those people overtaking us rude? He said yes they would be called rude. 

I started returning his rudeness by saying HE should be ashamed of himself for doing this to me a woman in front of his daughters. I also mentioned to him that when I ran, I didnt even know for sure if he was going to the restaurant tables area or the fries station area so to act like I did it to spite him was just uncalled for.

It was my second ever relationship, and the girl I connected with heavily so I was falling for her pretty fast, but she dumped me literally a week before our one month mark. Saying that ""im not mentally there for a relationship, I love you I do I just need me time, we can still be friends and we can even get back together when I feel ready"" to which I was fine with. And then when I tried to keep talking with her she dodged me, and or straight up ignored me. And that hurt, it was the second time I was told those exact words and I was hoping this time itd be different. But then she started unadding me on socials, snap, insta ect. So I began to get curious if she was honest with me on the breakup, so I looked at her discord profile. She had changed her profile to ""me and my bae"" (obviously not me, and it wasn't there when it would've been me) and her bio mentioned a boyfriend (obviously again, not me and it wasn't thre when it would've been related to me). So last night I asked her if she was seeing someone else, mind you its been a couple months by now, I just wanted the truth. And she responded ""does it really matter?"" To which I replied with ""yes, if I was lied to I think I have the right to know why, if I did something wrong I should be told why so that I can work on myself and fix it."", not getting too much into detail i have screenshots of the convo so just do dm me if you wanna see. She admitted that she dumped me for someone who was ""physically there"" referring to me as ""everything but nothing since you're not here."" And I asked why I wasn't told this to begin with, that I can take a break up. Its the lying that I can't take, and she spouted a paragraph about not wanting to hurt me, as if the fact I would've figured out I was lied to wouldn't hurt me more? And this is what I told her, she said she couldn't wait until summer. I should've put this in the beginning but oh well, I was planning to get a car and visit her this summer. And after the whole conversation ended one of her friends, who I felt never really liked me.

I wasn't mad, just curious so that I could move on, but her friend keeps insisting I worsened her mental health and that ""if she does something dumb its on you"". Now, again.

And that hurt, it was the second time I was told those exact words and I was hoping this time itd be different. But then she started unadding me on socials, snap, insta ect. So I began to get curious if she was honest with me on the breakup, so I looked at her discord profile. She had changed her profile to ""me and my bae"" (obviously not me, and it wasn't there when it would've been me) and her bio mentioned a boyfriend (obviously again, not me and it wasn't thre when it would've been related to me). So last night I asked her if she was seeing someone else, mind you its been a couple months by now, I just wanted the truth. And she responded ""does it really matter?"" To which I replied with ""yes, if I was lied to I think I have the right to know why, if I did something wrong I should be told why so that I can work on myself and fix it."", not getting too much into detail i have screenshots of the convo so just do dm me if you wanna see. She admitted that she dumped me for someone who was ""physically there"" referring to me as ""everything but nothing since you're not here."" And I asked why I wasn't told this to begin with, that I can take a break up. Its the lying that I can't take, and she spouted a paragraph about not wanting to hurt me, as if the fact I would've figured out I was lied to wouldn't hurt me more? And this is what I told her, she said she couldn't wait until summer. I should've put this in the beginning but oh well, I was planning to get a car and visit her this summer. And after the whole conversation ended one of her friends, who I felt never really liked me. Threatened to have her boyfriend come to my house and beat me as ""you have no right to talk to her like that"" mind you, I was entirely respectful, wasn't pushy. I wasn't mad, just curious so that I could move on, but her friend keeps insisting I worsened her mental health and that ""if she does something dumb its on you"". Now, again. I tend to he oblivious to things so in my mind all I was doing was asking why my trust was betrayed and I was blatantly lied to, so AITA?",0.0,0.24968835711479187,0,1
116,1du81mr,WIBTA for yelling at my mom?,"Sunday after work I started feeling horribly ill, then I realised I have food poisoning. It was absolute hell. Before it got too bad, I called my mom (she was in the other room and I was hugging the toilet) and asked her if she could get me something from the pharmacy. She told me there were no pharmacies open, because it was  like 8:30 in the evening (relatively small town). I checked google, and told her there was one closing in 30minutes, it’s a 5 minute drive away. She insisted that she knew their hours and knew that they were already closed.

I was sick the entire night, I slept maybe 40min straight before having to run to the bathroom, I was crying from stomach cramps and it was all around just miserable.

The next morning when she was finally awake, I confronted her and told her that was a really f*cked up thing to do, I would have at least checked if the pharmacy was open if she felt that bad. She started insisting that it was closed, but my reasoning is: most businesses set their own hours on google right? So why would they list 9 if they don’t close at 9? She just basically told me “I’m not in the mood to drive now, you can suffer until I’m willing to help you.” She apologised but I genuinely don’t think she feels bad, because I while after that, I told her I’m tired and don’t want to go to work, I slept so little. (I still had to go to work) she said “I know me too, it woke me up every time.” And that just f*cking broke me.

118,1du7pmg,AITA for not letting my daughter study?,"This post is about my oldest 2 kids, Nicole (21), and Ava (20). 

Nicole is a night owl. She can easily stay up all night and sleep through the day. Ava is the exact opposite. She's in bed by 10 and tries to sleep by 11. Nicole also has ADHD and Ava is AuDHD (autistic and ADHD).

The thing is Ava is very sensitive to light and sound when she's trying to sleep. Her room has to be pitch black with no sounds between 10:30 and 11, which is usually pretty easy to accommodate considering everyone but Nicole is also asleep/going to sleep at that time. 

Nicole is taking a condensed science class this summer. She goes to school from 11-2, is out with her friends or boyfriend until 10-10:30, then comes home to study, which can be 3-4 hours a night. She claims that she can only study in our dining room and the dining room light shines into Ava's room so Ava can't sleep with the dining room lights on. 

The other night Ava and Nicole got into an argument because it was almost midnight, Ava had to be up by 7 for work, and Nicole was refusing to work anywhere else. I used blankets to help block the light and she took sleeping pills to help her get to sleep. The next day when Ava got up at 7, she made sure to be loud enough to wake Nicole up. When Nicole got mad at her Ava brought up that Nicole doesn't let her sleep so why should she let her. 

I talked to the girls that day and Ava had some good points. There's other places in the house that Nicole can study and if it really has to be the dining room, she should be courteous and not stay out so late that she has to be in there until 2 in the morning. I agreed with her and told Nicole that from now on I'll be turning the wifi off at 10:30 unless she is working anywhere but the dining room or the living room directly outside of Ava's room. 

Today Nicole got home at 10:45 and went to the dining room to do an assignment and quiz that was due by 12. The wifi was off so she came to me to turn it on. I told her I will once she moves and she decided to argue and refused to move. She refused and didn't get to do her quiz or assignment, which severely impacted her grade. 

She's accusing me of playing favorites and sabotaging her because Ava wants to feel good about herself (Ava was originally in a similar program but switched to one that she actually enjoyed).

119,1du7nns,AITA For shouting at a dinner party?,"I (20M) joined a couple of acquaintances for a dinner party in our same apartment block. The hosts of the party (22M ""Peeta"" and 23F ""Virgo"") were vegetarians and wanted to practice cooking meat for their culinary experience.  In my conversations with them they mentioned that they didn't want to force vegetarianism on others so I thought I'd be willing to go to their dinner party. I also tell them that I'm allergic to peanuts and other tree nuts and they say they won't cook with any of that.

The meal is cheesy breadsticks, sliders with lettuce wraps, and ice cream. After ice cream I suddenly start feeling horrible. When I step out of their bathroom I must look horrible because my friend (Horace) tells me that my eyes are red and my nose is too. I ask for the ingredients list and Peeta tells me that he threw away the recipe list becuase he didn't want to have the temptation in the place and that Virgo just threw out the trash. I say that's not good enough and by this time I feel some indigestion in my stomach.

Horace grabs me a bag and empties it and inside is a receipt that says ""Beyond Meat"" among the other ingredients. I throw up in the bag and shout ""What the fuck is in that beyond meat?!"" 

Virgo says that it's just beans and peas. I throw my keys to Horace and tell him to run for my EpiPen in my apartment while another partygoer is keeping my head above the toilet.  The other partygoers are asking if they really did eat beef or if they ate something Vegan and Virgo says ""We were hoping no one could tell the difference.""

Horace returns with my epipen and injects me with it. While I'm feeling the initial effects sink in I say ""WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT?!"" This makes Peeta wince and he goes quiet and I keep asking him why he did that. Horace takes me to the ER.

While Horace is driving Peeta calls Horace and says that I ruined the party by yelling at him. He could have properly explained what happened and it could have all turned right. I tell Horace to hang up and Horace carries me to the ER. I have a talk with my doctor and he says that some peas trigger peanut reactions. Virgo tries callign me but I block her number and contact and here I am, typing on my phone on reddit for quick judgement while recovering with an IV bag.

My son's first birthday was on June 11, 2024. My partner and I decided to hold his party on Saturday, June 15. My nephew's birthday is June 12, and my sister wanted to plan his party around my son's. She claimed she couldn't do the weekend before or the weekend after and would probably arrange it for Sunday, June 16. 

To have a rest before my son's party, I booked holidays for my family from the weekend before until the day before his birthday. When I informed my sister, she got upset because she had decided she might actually do my nephew's party the weekend before my son's. I told her they would have to celebrate without us, which she got super mad about and led to us stopping communication.At my son's party, my sister was cold and rude, not even saying hi or bye to me or my partner and was generally disrespectful.

During the party, our dad gave her a gift for my nephew, which she forgot to take home. I decided to leave it with our aunt, who my sister visits more often than us, as I was still upset with her behavior.

Am I in the wrong for impulsively kicking her hand without thinking first??",,1.0184481143951416,1,0

125,1du6vu5,AITA for blaming my boyfriend when my dog ran away?,"So today my boyfriend (28M) was over at my (24F) house and we were putting new mulch down. When we were done with the front yard, he said he wanted to take a shower and watch TV. I asked him to wait and help me finish up the back as well. We got into a small argument about how I make him work too much and it culminated with him going inside and slamming the door. I continued to put down the mulch and do basic yardwork stuff when my boyfriend comes out and is kind of forcing my dog, Bella, out with his legs. He tells me that she won’t stop following him into the bathroom and I need to watch her until he gets out. I tell him to put her in my bedroom but he was already upset and tells me “just watch the dog.” I didn’t want to start another argument so I let her stay with me. I just told him to be fast and continued working, glancing over at Bella every once an a while to make sure she was ok. While planting a stubborn flower I didn’t look over at her for maybe two minutes because I was focused on what I was doing. In this time Bella ran away, likely chasing something. I couldn’t hear much above my music but when I finally turned and saw she was gone I started freaking out. I ran all around my house calling for her and yelled into the house for my boyfriend to come outside. I called people around my neighborhood to ask if they had seen her and nobody had. I get in my car and start slowly driving around looking for her and calling her name out the window. After about 2 hours or so of searching I decided to go back home to see if she came back as a last ditch effort. When I got back and she wasn’t there I was hysterical. I came inside and there was my boyfriend, watching TV. I immediately start yelling at him for not caring about Bella and he says that he does care but there is nothing he could have done. I’m still bawling my eyes out as I tell him this wouldn’t have happened if he just did what I asked him to do and he just scoffs. He said that this wouldn’t have happened if I actually watched my dog. I looked at him in disbelief, told him to get out of my house, and went looking for her again. After almost 3 more hours of looking the sun had set and I still couldn’t find her. I knew I wouldn’t find her in the dark and decided it would be best to sleep and try to find her in the morning. It’s about 1AM right now and I still can’t sleep because 1. I’m used to Bella sleeping next to me, and 2. I can’t stop thinking about the argument with my boyfriend. I really don’t think he thought this would happen but I just don’t understand why he would bring Bella outside if he knew I wouldn’t really be able to watch her. Even though it was my knee jerk reaction to blame him I can’t stop telling myself it was my fault and he’s right.

127,1du6o2n,WIBTA For not wishing my GF a happy after she told me she has no interest in spending her birthday with me?,"
Me (25M) & my GF (24F) Have been together for a little over a year. Our relationship has definitely been rocky for the most part. Although we are making strides to reduce our conflict during couples therapy, I would be lying if I didn’t say we have a long way to go. Our issues drain us both till this day.

 My GF has revealed to me recently that she doesn’t look forward towards her birthdays with much positivity anymore, at least not for the last 5 years. Each birthday she had something negative happen during it. It was a cycle of major issues either involving past exes, a guy she had talked to or her parents. Her experiences created a bad omen & outlook of negativity towards her birthday. This year she was unsure if she was either going to go all out (her birthday falls on the fourth of July) or wanting to keep it lowkey with a nice dinner at her favorite restaurant.

Recently, my girlfriend and I had a conversation over the phone that left her hanging up extremely angry (I suggested to her to seek individual therapy). Ironically  during this phone call, her best-friend reached out to me to confirm my plans for my GF’s birthday as she had intentions of throwing her own a surprise birthday party for my GF. The best-friend wasn’t sure what her plans were as my GF didn’t confirm to anyone in her social circle what she wanted to do for her birthday. 

At the time while I was on the phone with my GF, I told her best-friend that my GF was in a rough patch mentally and a surprise birthday would definitely lift her spirits up. Shortly after the phone call ended, I informed her that my GF was no longer talking to me anymore, so if she wanted to make the plans I would love to join her if my GF wanted me there.

Well her best-friend screenshotted the messages immediately and sent them straight to my GF. She was *furious*. She thought I no place in telling her best-friend our business and that she no longer had any interest in spending her birthday with me anymore. 

I was stunned and shocked. I told her that was unfair, and that it would hurt me not to be able to share her birthday with her. I also told her I had already purchased her birthday gifts most of which were already shipped towards her. She said she didn’t care and went off to continue to verbally drag me amongst other things.

 The conversation was shortly dropped afterwards. Later in the night she apologized for the nasty tirade & behavior that she had with me on the phone, but still confirmed that she didn’t want me spending time with her on her birthday as she didn’t want her birthday spoiled. I left the phone call feeling numb.

128,1du6f1y,AITA for wanting my dead moms side of the family to attend my graduation party instead of my step moms?,"I, 18 F graduated high school about a month ago. I’m sure you’re asking why my parents decided to throw a party a month later, the truth is that June was way too busy for everyone, and since I don’t really care much about time, we decided to do it July 6th.

So my step mom married my dad was I was about 8 or 9, and my mom passed away when I was 13. I’ve barely gotten to see my moms family much in my life because she only had limited visitation with my dad starting when I was four, and too high to notice my existence.

Ever since my mom died I have been able to get back into contact with my mom’s side of the family, I talk to them a lot and I have a lot to learn about my families history, but aside from that, I’ve never really been able to see them much since I was little.

Now as for my step mom’s family, her family gets invited to everything. It’s not like I don’t love them, but they attend everything, and sometimes it gets a little overwhelming because i feel like sometimes these aren’t really people here for me due to our lack of biological relation, but rather here for my stepmom, given the fact they talk to me for a little bit and always go over to her and gossip about whatever someone obscure in the family is doing on Facebook.

Recently, obviously I’ve been planning my graduation party. I was super excited because this is an event that I get to pay for and customize to be my own, and that also kinda includes who I want at the party. Yesterday my stepmom came into my room and asked me who I’m gonna be inviting to the party so she can know who all was gonna be coming. Now usually when this topic comes up, it’s more like “which friends are you inviting”, but this time, I brought up the fact that maybe my moms side of the family could attend, since I haven’t seen them in so long.

I expected her to be a little disappointed, sure, but what I didn’t expect was for her to start yelling asking me if I was being serious, and asked if I hated her family.

I told her no, and that I just wanted my moms side of the family to see the accomplishments I made as well, since I haven’t seen them in a long time, and they didn’t get to attend the actual ceremony, since my stepmom used all 7 spots to invite her family, and my dad.

She seemed to get more mad and tell me that my moms side of the family didn’t care about me anyways since they hadn’t talked to me in so long, so what should I invite them. I asked why I couldn’t just invite both families and she said that we didn’t have enough room at our house (which is understandable I guess).
My dad took her side and said that I need to choose the family that’s been there for me all my life instead of the side that’s only began to bring back communication with me 4 years ago.

tldr: i started crying in front of guests while i was baking bc i was frustrated and i started crying harder when my grandma told me shame on you and we got in an argument about it after she told me go to bed and they left.

I just want to know if I’m in the wrong here


update: 

thank you everyone for all your advice, i did end up trying some of them with the stuff i had on hand. And they came out well enough, i font know how to put pictures on here but once i find out I’ll post it ",0.0,0.024275582283735275,0,1
131,1du5xiv,AITA for not going to my best friends wedding?," I and my then best friend who we'll call Marie had been best friends for 6 years. Our kids were best friends and we were inseparable. 

In April she was getting married. So her bach party was set for end of march. We had talked about 2 1/2 weeks before the party and she asked my shirt size as we were getting matching shirts. She told me it would be $18. That was the last I heard from her, I was messaging her for the remaining 2  weeks asking for more details on the party and where we were meeting etc.

 2 days before the party I message her again and said I needed to know what was going on and she responded and said that she pretty much uninvited me because she didn't think I could afford it because I would have to pay the price of the shirt which was ($18) and then pay for part of a limo which was about $200 for my portion (she never mentioned there would be a ride fee for everyone especially cause she knew I'd be meeting them there) and then whatever drinks and food I wanted for that night. She said she never told me because she just assumed I couldn't afford it. I wasn't planning on riding in the limo and she knew this because I live an hour away from where they would be getting in the limo and the place they were going was only 20 min from me so I had said I'd just meet them there, something she was also aware of. I told her that i was upset because she should have given me the option to say I can't afford it. But that wouldn't have been the case because I could have afforded it and gone.

 Fast forward to her wedding, it was On a sat. on Thursday I had collapsed and was unconscious putting me in the ER for a 48hrs due to a heart condition I have. I waited until after her wedding to tell her so I didn't ruin any part of her day. I explained what happened the following day and never heard anything. She ended up blocking me and unfriended me on all social media. Aita for all of this? This best friend break up hurts my heart so much, like more than any actual break up has hurt me.

132,1du5wb9,AITAH for refusing to attend my wife’s bestie’s wedding? ,"My wife had an affair several years ago. I found out because her phone data use suddenly skyrocketed. I investigated, saw the number on the bill and figured out it was her ex. She denied it, of course, which eventually led to me snooping in her phone. She had tried to cover her tracks, but she didn’t delete text messages to her best friend describing everything, bragging about it, etc. Her friend was supportive, at times even encouraging her to continue the affair. 

We’ve reconciled since then, and things are pretty okay between us, but I still hold a lot of anger towards her friend, partly for encouraging her to do what she did, instead of telling her to do the right thing, and I think partly because her messages with her friend were the vehicle that delivered so much pain and torment to me. Even now, seeing her friend or hearing her name makes me think of the affair. 

Her friend is getting married in a few months and she is the MOH. I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety surrounding the thought of having to attend. Finally, I decided that I needed to protect myself. I would be miserable the entire time, and the idea of celebrating the marriage of a person who, at the very least, severely disrespected mine, feels disgusting. 

When I told my wife that I had decided I wouldn’t go, she became pretty upset. She said she was hurt, but it felt more like anger to me. She basically shutdown after that, and hasn’t talked to me. I explained my reasoning, my feelings, etc, but she kind of blew me off. 

I don’t feel like the villain, for one, I didn’t ask to feel this way, her actions put me here. Two, she is the one who implicated her friend in the affair, if she hadn’t done that, it wouldn’t even be an issue. Also, I didn’t imply that she couldn’t or shouldn’t go, I even encouraged her to attend and be a part of it, and offered to drive her to and from. Am I the asshole?

133,1du5sit,AITAH for quitting my nanny job without giving two weeks?,"Hello! I started a nanny job and quit shortly after. During my initial interview where I went to meet the family the dad showed up an hour late so I had to play with the kids, which is fine but it was unpaid time that I was essentially working. Also just frustrating that I had to sit around for an hour waiting for the dad to get home from work. 

I started working on a Wednesday and it didn’t take long for me to find out I did not enjoy nannying for the family. In the interview I was told I would occasionally have to do minimal house work. That minimal house work meant doing the laundry of both the kids and parents along with all the dishes including dinner from the previous night (after my hours) and breakfast from the morning (before my hours). It also included cleaning up the mom’s lunch and all of her baking that she would do. The mom was a stay at home mom and all her kids M, 3 and F, 1.5 wanted was their mom because she was always in the house. 

By Monday (day 4) I had decided that I needed to quit and I intended to put my two weeks in to allow them time to find a new nanny. I was sick on Tuesday and Wednesday and did not work. When I went in on Thursday there were 9 dirty diapers on the floor throughout the house for me to pick up from the previous two days, the sink was overflowing with dishes and the kids dirty silverware were on the floor. The island was also covered in dirty dishes. The family clearly had not cleaned up at all in the two days I was sick and had left everything for me.

136,1du5ga2,AITA for not discontinuing a friendship with my friend’s ex,"I (16F) have a close friend Millie (16F). Last year she started dating George (17M) about a year ago. He would constantly insult me and argue with me and we couldn’t be in the same vicinity peacefully. Eventually, we got to the point of being able to co-exist only slightly arguing and being able to have nice conversation. George and Millie’s relationship began to go downhill and I was put in the middle. Millie would tell me to call our group chat because George wouldn’t answer her privately and would only answer in a group setting. On these calls I’d confront him about how he was treating her or me and Millie would sometimes join in.

From the start I told Millie that George wasn’t good for her but she never listened. They went on a period where they were just friends but Millie pushed George to do things like hold her hand, walk her to class, and facetime her but he didn’t like that. After a while of this Millie got upset and told me to call George and press him on his behavior. He admitted to feeling forced to keep doing stuff with her and only wanted friendship. I told Millie what he had said and told her to just end it but she didn’t listen and continued to force things. They didn’t stop speaking until he ghosted her for around three days and she finally broke up with him.

A few months passed by and George got a long term girlfriend El (18f). Once George and El broke up Millie told me she wanted to get back with George. I disapproved and said no. She asked me to be his friend and feed information to her. I pushed back but still became friends with George and told her important things. This went on for a while until I genuinely began enjoying our friendship and saw that he was an actually changed person. We opened up to each other about a lot and he apologized about the way he treated me. 

Here’s where I may be the asshole: After showing Millie our chats she had a problem because:
1. George called me “cute” and gave me a pep talk about being fine the way i am and finding someone one day (I opened up about body issues & and love life)
2. George said something along the lines of “talk to me bub” when we were having an emotional conversation over text.
3. George invited me to go grab food with him and his friend for his birthday.

On George’s birthday, Millie texted him happy birthday as a way to rekindle but he responded nicely saying he didn’t want to talk. Disappointed, she told me to cut him off even though I previously told her that the friendship was real and genuine to me. She thinks that he is flirting with me but I see all of our conversations as platonic and I see him as a friend who has really changed into a better person. She said that I’m weird and that I obviously like him too so now I’m sitting here confused after typing this all out.

We kept in touch but as years went on we called less and less. We texted more than called but even that became less and less. 

As the distance happened, I felt like I tried more than she did and eventually I stopped. We never stopped being friends but things changed. I did a bit more. If she called I answered, but she didn't call much. In fact 4 years ago I had a fire that destroyed my home, she called one time to check on us, other than that it was texting updates. It hurt but I knew she had two kids and a job. I knew she had a lot on her plate (for the record I have two kids too). Part of me felt she was done, it stung but I got it. We were growing apart.

Recently I had a family drama. It was hard and I knew she'd get it more than my new friends because she understood the history  I tried to call, no answer. I texted and we made a date to talk but my daughter had a school function, it ran late and I forgot up call. We talked, I explained all seemed fine 

I texted two days ago and asked if we could chat.. she agreed abd gave a time to call I forgot again because my mom called and kept me on the phone almost 2 hours. She texted and asked what happened. I explained, she never responded. I tried to call, she didn't answer

I know I screwed up the last few times but I've given her so much grace in the past and I feel like she's not giving the sand courtesy.",4.0,1.0585652589797974,1,0
140,1du55ru,AITA for not giving a baseball to a group of kids? ,"Went to a baseball game the other day and a whole group of kids (around 9/10 years old) were sitting behind us. They screamed and shouted the entire game (at the players and at each other). As in, yelling CONSTANTLY throughout the entire game. They also kept kicking our seats. There were several parents with them and not a single parent ever told the kids to stop, with one of the parents actually encouraging the screaming, in order to increase their chances of getting noticed/getting a ball thrown their way. My ears were ringing by the end of the 1st period.

Low and behold, a player notices them and eventually goes on to throw 4 balls their way (not all at the same time, they were thrown at different points throughout the game). The first 2 balls end up getting caught by other people/kids. The 3rd ball that was thrown ended up below my seat. I grab the ball and give it to my dad, who is a lifelong baseball fan but is a first gen immigrant and didn’t grow up being able to go to games. I got our seats specifically because I knew it would mean so much to my dad to be sitting so close to the field. 

Anyways, we keep the ball for ourselves. The kids continue to scream and now they’re screaming at me for not handing the ball over. If my ears hadn’t been ringing the entire game from all their yelling, I would’ve given it to them but I was honestly so fed up at that point, especially at their parents who chose not to intervene. They eventually were able to get ball, but even after having successfully caught a ball - they continued to SCREAM, as they still wanted more baseballs. I also don’t really go to baseball games and don’t super understand the etiquette of catching foul balls vs balls that are thrown by a player specifically, so maybe I’m wrong here but I can’t stress enough that my ears were ringing. I get that people cheer at games but I think there’s a difference between that and outright screaming for 9 innings. There were a few other kids around us that were perfectly pleasant the whole game.

141,1du54uk,AITA for moving my family for my job?,"I am in a very specialized and lucrative profession. So is my wife. We have been married 7 years just this past May and were together before our wedding for three years. When we met, we were already both in our respective professions. 

I know my profession has not been easy on her. It requires constant travel and sometimes longer trips over seas. I have always come home and “made it work” professionally, as long as possible, while I didn’t have to go elsewhere for work. The pay for the work “nearby” (over 50 miles away) is a fraction of what I get paid for actually doing my job where there is real work to be done. 

After 10 years of being together, we have both excelled in our professions. She has never had to travel for work and I always have. So where we are right now is after I return home from this, I have a  position in my profession that will allow me to never have to travel again. The only problem is that it isn’t near home. We have to move. 

It would mean I can continue to work professionally (and she could as well) and never have to go elsewhere to continue to advance. Home and work would be in the same place. I will also be making enough that she won’t have to work right away once we move (to give her time to settle in and look for jobs on her own time and get to know the area). She wants to return to work but it’s nice we won’t be in dire straits for her to contribute financially. But all she wants to do now is (literally) tell me how narcissistic I am and how I am “forcing her” to leave everything behind for my job and that I am putting my job first and my family second. She has told me this with animosity at least 50 times. 

She is packing the house and planning to move but she is torturing my mind and soul about this whole thing. At the same time she has constantly complained how none of our family (her family lives 4 hours away and mine is 1 hour away) or friends (from life, work, or church) have been there for her but she is holding it against me that I am making her leave all that behind. I don’t know what to do or say anymore. She makes me feel absolutely insane and helpless. ALL I want is to have my family with me AND be able to do my job so I can continue to take care of us and give us the life we want. Now I can and she is acting like I am her sworn mortal enemy. Please help. I really don’t know what to say to put her in a better mental state about all this. I am also lost as to why she is making it so torturous on me. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s like she is trying to sabotage the entire plan but somehow make it my fault because I lost composure dealing with the nonsense of all her irrational emotions. I have tried extremely hard to be patient but I am at a point where I just completely shut down and let her tear me apart but I have no idea of what else to do about it.

143,1du4yly,WIBTA if I cancel my mother's trip to meet her grandson?,"I (38m) currently live in China. Been here for 10 years. Because of this, I haven’t seen my family much outside of summer vacation and one Christmas vacation before COVID hit. When the lockdown hit it was especially hard, but I managed.

My mother is very child-centered. She has always put her kids first(I’m the oldest of 3). She made sure we always had everything we needed and wanted. She taught me all the lessons and skills for life. A big part of who I am today is because of her.

Around my early 20’s I started noticing a change in her personality. When it came to big decisions, she became more eager to be involved in the decision-making process. But it was more than that.

In her mind, her advice was to be considered as instructions. If I wanted to be successful, I needed to follow her words exactly. When I didn’t she would berate me for not listening, call me stupid, or say I deserved the outcome I got because I was stubborn.

This attitude has not changed now that I’m in my 30s. 2 years ago, I was preparing to pop the question to my now wife. My mother called me and begged me not to go through with it. She said I didn’t know enough about the woman, that I wasn’t sure if she truly loved me and wanted me to be successful. When I told her that I trusted this woman, she raged. She called me a stubborn dumbass who was going to end up alone. Before I could try to calm her down, she hung up on me.

Now here I am at 38, married to my amazing wife and 14 hours ago she gave birth to our first child (a boy, btw). It’s been a roller coaster for her, but she took it like a champ. I’m so proud of her, and feel blessed to have her in my life. 

Last night I called my mom to share updates and photos. Everything seemed fine until she started comparing my wife’s birth to her own, telling me about how difficult it was, how much pain she went through, and how my wife’s labor was considerably easier than hers. She started talking about how maybe now that I am a parent I would finally begin to understand the things she went through raising me and my 2 siblings. 

I feel like my mom was trying to steal the spotlight and make this huge milestone all about her. To me it felt like she was trying to inject herself into a situation that she had nothing to do with. She didn’t even want me to marry this woman in the first place.

This morning I talked to my wife about what happened. While she agrees that it was a bit selfish and toxic of her, she also understands that my mom is frustrated for not being able to be personally involved. Just let her get it out of her system. My wife is an angel of patience.

For 3 months my wife, mom, and myself have been planning a trip for her and my brother to come up to China. We’ve been helping with VISA applications, finding flights, and things to do during their stay. But after what happened last night, I’m considering confronting my mother about her actions and canceling the trip altogether. WIBTA?

144,1du4syt,AITA for my moms dog ,"So to start this off, I love animals. I’ve had dogs my whole life and have taken care of them my whole life. I would never ignore an animal if needed help especially my own. 

So like I said I grew up with dogs and probably about 3-4 years ago my dog died (the last of my two childhood dogs.) My mom then decided she needed a buddy and just felt empty at home, and she decided to get my current dog. I wasn’t necessarily happy about her getting him and neither was my dad, but I accepted him as my own and he grew on me like any dog does. But I think 1-2 months after getting him, he became paralyzed in his hind legs. It was devastating seeing him kind of just drag himself randomly and we had never dealt with it before. So we got him situated with wheels and all that and times goes on and gets older. He’s probably around 11-12 now. This is where it gets really annoying to me. 

My parents recently split up (still living in the same house) and I live here as well so I’m just lkinda stuck in the middle. Neither of them come home very often and lone and behold I’m the only one to care of the dog.  I don’t mind usually if I need to feed him and clean him up. But to fully take over his breakfast, lunch, dinner, hanging out with him for more than 5 mins. It’s really hard to get close to my dog because I feel like he’s in discomfort and pain and depressed that no one is around him anymore. I have my own life too and I can’t stop and revolve around him because of my parents issues. It’s thrown on me now and I feel so overwhelmed and upset that he sits alone and helpless basically all day until my mom comes home “to feed him” and then just leaves. It makes me feel like she doesn’t care or want the responsibility anymore and it makes me really sad. I’ve been dealing with the divorce hard as well and this just makes me sad that him and I are alone together but I can’t fix him. I can’t just spend all day like I want too. I just dwell about him when I’m not home. On top of this, he’s a diabetic and has skin issues. & as you know dogs with paralysis have issues with bowel movements and such so he sometimes will have poop on him and it’s stuck in his fur for however long I wasn’t home.

146,1du4poa,AITA for asking my sister not to tell my mom that I'm having a party without her full consent?,"I (20F) am planning my 20th birthday party and I decided to ask my mom as a favor if I could host it at my house. I even asked her if she could go out of town for the party because I was concerned that the noise and the late hour that I was planning to have it at would disturb her. She agreed and planned a trip to visit my dad in Florida for the week, which I'm also very grateful for, as I know not a lot of parents would do that. This would leave me and my sister (21F) as the only ones left in the house. My parents trust my sister a lot more than me, not that I've done anything particularly irresponsible, but I'm known to make somewhat spontaneous decisions. Nothing that most teenagers haven't done. I'm also in a (professional) fraternity and drink almost every weekend when I'm at school, which my parents don't know the entirety of. My sister on the other hand acts like she's my mother most of the time in that she tells me what to do and she's a huge stickler for the rules.

The main detail here is that right before my mom left for her trip, she asked me if there was going to be any drinking at this party. Blindsided, I said no, which was a blatant lie as I'd made it clear in the invitation that drinking was welcome (not necessarily encouraged and definitely not provided, but welcome). My mom then made it clear that no drinking was her only rule for this party. She ended up telling my sister to keep an eye on me.

I asked my sister if she was planning to be home on the night of the party. She said yes, and asked if I was planning on having people drink. I told her that I was, and she immediately got cold and yelled at me for breaking my mother's only rule in her own house. I did feel guilty for lying, but I know that neither of my parents nor my sister understand that I wanted to, for once, have a party with alcohol that I host and that I can have all my friends at. Not that I can't have fun without it, but if there's a time to have parties like this, it's now. I'm also a commuter, so I don't have a place on campus that I could host at. It's hard to justify what I'm saying to her though without her saying something along the lines of ""why do you need alcohol at your party, just respect that one single rule that you agreed to follow, if not then move out and get your own house and have a party there"", getting on her high horse about how she's never done anything like this and she would never lie to my parents about something ""as serious"" as this.

I do have friends who are sober and going to be there in case anything goes wrong, and I feel like the least she could do instead of completely shutting my idea down or snitching is be there for me in case of emergencies. I just don't think this detail is something my mom needs to know about.",Asshole,2024-07-03,"AITA for asking my sister not to tell my mom that I'm having a party without her full consent? I (20F) am planning my 20th birthday party and I decided to ask my mom as a favor if I could host it at my house. I even asked her if she could go out of town for the party because I was concerned that the noise and the late hour that I was planning to have it at would disturb her. She agreed and planned a trip to visit my dad in Florida for the week, which I'm also very grateful for, as I know not a lot of parents would do that. This would leave me and my sister (21F) as the only ones left in the house. My parents trust my sister a lot more than me, not that I've done anything particularly irresponsible, but I'm known to make somewhat spontaneous decisions. Nothing that most teenagers haven't done. I'm also in a (professional) fraternity and drink almost every weekend when I'm at school, which my parents don't know the entirety of. My sister on the other hand acts like she's my mother most of the time in that she tells me what to do and she's a huge stickler for the rules.

The main detail here is that right before my mom left for her trip, she asked me if there was going to be any drinking at this party. Blindsided, I said no, which was a blatant lie as I'd made it clear in the invitation that drinking was welcome (not necessarily encouraged and definitely not provided, but welcome). My mom then made it clear that no drinking was her only rule for this party. She ended up telling my sister to keep an eye on me.

I asked my sister if she was planning to be home on the night of the party. She said yes, and asked if I was planning on having people drink. I told her that I was, and she immediately got cold and yelled at me for breaking my mother's only rule in her own house. I did feel guilty for lying, but I know that neither of my parents nor my sister understand that I wanted to, for once, have a party with alcohol that I host and that I can have all my friends at. Not that I can't have fun without it, but if there's a time to have parties like this, it's now. I'm also a commuter, so I don't have a place on campus that I could host at. It's hard to justify what I'm saying to her though without her saying something along the lines of ""why do you need alcohol at your party, just respect that one single rule that you agreed to follow, if not then move out and get your own house and have a party there"", getting on her high horse about how she's never done anything like this and she would never lie to my parents about something ""as serious"" as this.

I plan to manage the party very well and avoid accidents, and if anything does go wrong, take care of it and clean it up. I do have friends who are sober and going to be there in case anything goes wrong, and I feel like the least she could do instead of completely shutting my idea down or snitching is be there for me in case of emergencies.

147,1du4oir,WIBTA for telling my parents to sell my late sisters car,"So for context, my (M25) little sister(23) passed away in March of this year after a long battle with cancer. It’s hands down the hardest thing I’ve ever been through and I’ve been struggling to motivate myself to do simple things like go to work and clean up after myself ever since. I have a minimum wage job and no college degree, so I live pay check to pay check and my job opportunities are limited at best. My parents have mostly been very supportive of me and my healing process, but there is one point of contention which is my late sisters car.

I currently drive a 1999 civic and it is a piece of shit. Constantly has problems, leaks oil, makes weird noises when I drive it too fast, but it’s functional and I’ve learned to live with it as it’s all I could afford. I’ve had this car for years now and I have never asked my parents for a different car. Pretty shortly after my sister passed, my dad mentioned giving me her car since it’s more modern, reliable and fuel efficient. At first it seemed like the plan was for me to take that car and give mine to my cousin who is learning how to drive. This made sense to me as my parents don’t need the car or the money they’d get from selling it, and it would make a huge difference in my life.

Then a few weeks later my dad mentions the car again, but now there’s a condition. I have to find a new, higher paying job by September. If I do then the cars mine, if I don’t then they will just sell it. That car was a huge part of my sisters life, she named it and accessorized it and genuinely loved the thing. And I’m honestly pretty peeved that now it’s being dangled in front of me, and whether or not this piece of my sister gets sold is entirely on me. My mom hasn’t even gone back to work yet, but they expect me to find a whole new career?

So here’s where I may be the AH. I want to tell them to just sell it. As much as I don’t want to see that part of her go, I won’t be able to handle it if I feel like it’s my fault because I failed to find a good job. And I resent them for putting me in this position, threatening to sell off something so important to her just as a way to motivate me.

So, WIBTA if I just told them to sell it?

TLDR; parents are going to give me my recently passed sisters car if I get a better job, but will sell it if I don’t get a better job by September. I want to tell them to just sell it because the whole situation feels kind of fucked up

EDIT: I was unclear. While I have trouble motivating myself to clean up and go to work, I have recently gotten back to a normal schedule and gotten back on top of chores and household things. I’m still going through it, but right now I’m pretty much living the same way I was prior to my sister passing

EDIT 2: I do not live at home, I rent a place with my girlfriend and another couple we are close with

EDIT 3: I just need to say this, this whole deal would not bug me in the slightest if it was about literally any other car.

157,1du3typ,AITA for refusing to dance at my friends wedding?,"My friend is getting married in a week and they are doing gender mixed bridal parties so i'm a woman but i'm in the grooms bridal party.

Last week i got a message from the groom saying the bride doesn't want them to do their first dance alone because shes nervous so they are asking all the people in the bridal party to dance too. He said he would pair us up and we had to learn the waltz if we didn't already know it.

i responded and said i wasn't really comfortable dancing in front of that many people (i have bad anxiety and he knows this) and that i don't know how to waltz and probably won't have time to learn in just 2 weeks because of prior commitments.

I had a friend who is also in the grooms party reach out to me and tell me he also isn't comfortable doing it for similar reasons including the fact he works 11 hour days 6 days a week. Considering there is 10 people all together in both parties i suggested that me and the other friend sit out and they can have the other 8 people dance with them. 

The bride then loses it at me and asks how can i be so selfish and why am i ruining their wedding. She said when i accepted to be in the bridal party i knew i would have to make sacrifices and if i wasn't willing to then i shouldn't have accepted. She went on a huge rant about it and about how i'm a horrible person and i need to just shut up and do it because it's her wedding and that's what she wants.

I explained that i thought it wasn't fair to drop this on us 2 weeks out from the wedding and that if this had of been brought up earlier i might not have accepted but at least i would have had time to prepare and make that decision. She buckled down and said it was a reasonable request and that i need to grow up and do it and stop being selfish.

Up until this point i have done everything and anything asked of me in regards to the wedding without complaint. As far as i'm aware the other person in the bridal party who didn't want to do it didn't cop nearly as much abuse as i did. I'm starting to feel like she doesn't like me because at one of the 3 pre-wedding brunches we had to go to everyone got a box with their name on it and mine was spelt wrong and crossed out with the correct spellng next to it. (my name is a bit oddly spelt so i didnt think much of it at the time). 

Am i the asshole here?

I’m talking about multiple pics and clips in a single day of kids doing typical kid shit. And their kids are cute and it was fine at first, but it got old and out of hand real quick.  

Inevitably, it got to the point where I boiled over and let them know that the constant pics were obnoxious and they need to stop forcing feeding their kids down our throats.  I also told them that if they felt the need to receive the attention they crave, they should post them on a platform that’s meant for pictures and videos like instagram or Facebook (which they do also).  

This led to some division within the group.  A couple of my buddies agree with me while 3 (which includes the 2 habitual offenders) are calling me an asshole.  It’s gotten to the point where it’s driving a wedge between us. I don’t share any pics with my friends to not be a hypocrite.

It should also be noted that I have left the chat on multiple occasions because I do need a break every so often (not solely because of over sharing but it doesn’t help).

163,1du2aqs,AITA for ignoring my mom's birthday?,"Title is awful, I know. However, I think I have a decent basis where my ignoring her birthday is valid. 

Her birthday hasn't happened yet, it's on July 5th. I (17ftm), have already decided that I will not be wishing or attending my mother(35F)'s birthday. She's turning 36. For background context:

I don't live with my mother. Last year in May, I was hospitalized for a psychiatric emergency. I was in a REALLY bad spot, and my mother was the one to drive me to the hospital to be evaluated. Her and I hadn't had anything CLOSE to a good relationship. In fact, a lot of the things she'd done and the ways she treated me are why I was hospitalized. When she was driving me to the hospital, though, she told me:
""You are not welcome back in my house, I need to protect my children and I won't let you put them in danger""
Mind you, I have two younger siblings. At the time, she was having me babysit my younger sister every day from 5 am to 4 pm, full time, since I was in a homeschooling program. I had attempted to explain to her about a week or so prior that I was in a messed up state, she did nothing about it until a professional said it was necessary.
So after a week in the hospital and two months in a residential, I moved in with my grandparents. Which she was livid about, because apparently she didn't mean 'your not welcome' as a permanent solution. However, there was no way I could continue treatment if I moved back in with her, so I didn't. Her and I hardly talk anymore, and every time I've seen her, it's been dramatic and needlessly complicated. For my 17th birthday, she sent a text asking what I wanted her to 'get or do' for me. When I told her I didn't have any big plans, she made it VERY clear she wanted me to hang out with her. So I tried to arrange with her what we could do together, and she essentially bailed last moment because it was 'too cold' to go to a coffee shop(?). So I went over, we played card games, she talked shit about me the entire night, etc. Then, months later, I learned that I was ahead in my education(graduating before 18, the last estimate was at 22), and she told the entire family on her side a delayed end-date for my schooling. In all honesty, I'm just tired of her. She gets over 300 on childsupport for me even though she hasn't spent a dime on me in years, she lies, she puts me down in every way she can, etc.

And I honestly am tired of it and don't want to deal with it anymore, so I decided I'm not going to reach out for her birthday and know I'm going to get backlash for it.

164,1du2a5q,AITA For Telling Friend I Understand Where His Kids Are Coming From?,"Edit: I added this in the comments too, but he was not the main provider in the family - his wife worked full time 6 days a week and he only worked a few hours a handful of days each week. He didn't contribute much around the house either; he literally meant that him and his hobbies/entertainment were most important to him. It wasn't like he was buying their affection. 

 My friend and I are both older in life, though I am childless. He has two daughters and a son, all late teens/early twenties. We went out for lunch the other day and he made a comment about how ungrateful his kids are because they don't spend time with him after everything he did to raise them, especially now that his wife has passed. I told him that while I understood how hurt he must feel but that this is a result of his own actions, which he had been warned of. 

For the record, he was around when the children were growing up but he wasn't the most involved parent. He got up, went to work before everyone else woke up, came home before everyone else and indulged in his hobbies, saw the family for a few minutes and went to bed every day. His wife did most of the parenting, from feeding them, to taking them to school and attending all activities. She made a point of getting to know all of their friends and learn all of their hobbies, while he did not. She took care of every injury and sickness, never getting a break for herself while he made it clear that he was his top priority. He very rarely played with the children directly when they were much younger. He always said they needed to learn the importance of independent play and to not rely on him for entertainment. He would ignore them asking to spend time with him and very rarely went out of his way to do anything the family would've enjoyed. In his words, he didn't want to ""spoil them"" and he was ""helping them balance their lives."" I had mentioned to him numerous times before that this didn't seem like it would have any positive effects on them, but he didn't believe me. He said they just needed to share his exact hobbies if they wanted to do something together. As someone who grew up with a family like that, I realized that it would most likely just teach the children their father didn't want anything to do with them and they would stop seeking his attention. As they got older, they did just that and their mom and I eventually stopped trying to get him to be more involved. He considered them spending time with their mom as spending time with him by extension, so he didn't realize what he was losing until she was gone. Now that she's dead, they have no reason to reach out anymore and have their own lives elsewhere. They keep in touch with me as I've always been like an uncle to them and tried to fill in for their dad, but I'm not a total replacement. 

After our conversation, he left the restaurant quickly and sent me multiple messages calling me an AH, demanding I cut contact with his kids to teach them a lesson for disrespecting him. I don't think I'm in the wrong here but another mutual friend says I'm an AH for not being more supportive of him while he deals with this and losing his wife. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-03,"AITA For Telling Friend I Understand Where His Kids Are Coming From? Edit: I added this in the comments too, but he was not the main provider in the family - his wife worked full time 6 days a week and he only worked a few hours a handful of days each week. He didn't contribute much around the house either; he literally meant that him and his hobbies/entertainment were most important to him. It wasn't like he was buying their affection. 

 My friend and I are both older in life, though I am childless. He has two daughters and a son, all late teens/early twenties. We went out for lunch the other day and he made a comment about how ungrateful his kids are because they don't spend time with him after everything he did to raise them, especially now that his wife has passed. I told him that while I understood how hurt he must feel but that this is a result of his own actions, which he had been warned of. 

For the record, he was around when the children were growing up but he wasn't the most involved parent. He got up, went to work before everyone else woke up, came home before everyone else and indulged in his hobbies, saw the family for a few minutes and went to bed every day. His wife did most of the parenting, from feeding them, to taking them to school and attending all activities. She made a point of getting to know all of their friends and learn all of their hobbies, while he did not. She took care of every injury and sickness, never getting a break for herself while he made it clear that he was his top priority. He very rarely played with the children directly when they were much younger. He always said they needed to learn the importance of independent play and to not rely on him for entertainment. He would ignore them asking to spend time with him and very rarely went out of his way to do anything the family would've enjoyed. In his words, he didn't want to ""spoil them"" and he was ""helping them balance their lives."" I had mentioned to him numerous times before that this didn't seem like it would have any positive effects on them, but he didn't believe me.
