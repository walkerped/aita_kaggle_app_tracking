Well my step dad finally unblocked me on fb after blocking me back in December over the fact that I made a decision to stay with my hubby after something we went through. My mom on the other hand has barely texted me at all especially regarding my baby. Now I don't and never expected her to talk to me abt my baby but I figured most parents of children who are having their grandchildren, maybe wanna ask questions abt the grand baby. Now I keep low contact with my parents due to the childhood abuse they had put me through so neither of them have my phone number. But my problem is, they think they can be in my baby's life and mine after disowning me bc of the decisions I made while being with hubby. They had previously told me back when I was 18 that if I were to become pregnant, they wanted nothing to do with my baby. Now I found a post back from when I found out that I was pregnant that my step dad posted while he had me blocked. It was him mentioning how he is a grandpa and my mother is a grandma. Now the only thing my mom has asked me abt my baby was the gender. After that I haven't received a single message from her. But the only person I have that's going to be a grandpa on my side is my bio dad, he's been nothing but been an amazing help especially with my baby and myself. Now I believe the only reason my step dad unblocked me was bc I started calling my bio dad ""dad"" and not him. The only reason I think this is bc in a conversation I had with my mom, I called my bio dad ""dad"" and she kept calling my step dad, my dad when she referred to him.

2,1duuau0,"AITA : For criticizing her boyfriend as she did, and talking about my late best friend ?","*English is not my first language.*

I (25 M) lost my best friend three months ago. I was (and still is) living in hell.

One day, I wanted to talk about her.

Carol (25 F) said : ""Sorry I don’t have the energy to talk about it right now"", and then sends me texts about her situationship. I try other days. Her : ""Huh, I would have liked a TW about depression"". I understood. This was a difficult topic for her. One day, she told me all about her existential questions, and didn't mince her word talking about death. The funeral of my friend was, in my mind : seconds ago. I didn't need a brutal reminder about how cruel death was. I just wanted to talk about my best friend. No her death.

Weeks later Carol invited me to the first gig of Boyfriend. While she and I were eating, I said : "" That was really good, especially for a first show ! The guitarist was not always in time, but with the anxiety it’s normal, this was great !"".

Later, we were planning to go to the bar together. She texts : ""I will go with another person, and if that person is not available, I will not go with you"".

I asked : ""why ? Is there any problem with me ?"" She answered : ""Yes.  
-- So what is the problem ?""  
Next day she refuses to tell me what the problem was and instead said that I was exercising pressure on her with my grief…

The problem : she felt that I was talking about Boyfriend negatively (especially in what I said about his gig). Me : « That’s very hypocritical coming from you.  
– I’m in the right to talk about my Boyfriend, not you, » she said.



So, I decided to express that the Boyfriend problem was too much for me considering what i’m traversing. And that there was no emotional balance between Carol and I.

She told me there was, because that she was listening to my problems. But no. So I stood my ground and asked : “why did you speak in such detail about death if you knew I just lost someone and was not recovering from that ? Was I the best person to talk to about that ?

She said : ""Did you think I was serious ? Did you get worried about me because I was talking about death ? Don’t worry ! I have friends much closer than you ; if I want to talk, I can join them. You, I join you only when my friends are not available. So I'll talk to them. ""  
She said that this was my fault if I was worrying, since she hadn’t spoken about not being well for a week. ""No news is good news"". She stated: this is not her responsibility to give news. In the contrary this is my responsibility to check if she is OK, if I’m worried.

The discussion concluded when I said that in regard to what I was traversing, I found that she didn’t take my situation in consideration and was just dumping all of her problems without ever giving a shit about what I feel.

She admitted : “This is true, when I speak to you, I don’t take in consideration that you are grieving for your friends"".

This ended up there.

3,1duu9cc,AITA if I don’t pay the house cleaner?,"We hired a house cleaner to do a one time deep clean of our new home before we move in and after we finished a small construction project. Everything seemed great initially with their communication and they had been recommended locally so I had confidence in them (turns out those that recommended this person were family members). They let me know when they were finished and sent me an invoice. Based on the text messages of when they arrived and finished it appears they were at the house for 2.5-3 hours. I arrived to the house about an hour after they were finished and was so disappointed to see the outcome. I could not find any evidence that anything had been cleaned. The floors were still full of marks, dust on surfaces, blinds in the same position, trash in the kitchen and no smell of any cleaning products at all. The house is vacant but we do have a few gift baskets that were given to us when we closed on the house in the kitchen. All of these things were in the exact same position, nothing had been moved (for reference these things weren’t arranged decoratively they were just kind of on the counter so it isn’t just like the cleaner put them back in the exact same spot). I gave the cleaner a call to express my concern and inquire if there was miscommunication on what had been asked. They just said they could come back and clean the floors or take 50% off the $300+ bill. I asked for clarification on what was cleaned and they didn’t really say anything just said they spent several hours at my house. I said I wasn’t comfortable paying the bill because I was quite confident little to nothing had actually been cleaned and though they may have been present in my home there was no evidence of work being done.

4,1duu8wb,AITA for wanting my husband to take a DNA test on a possible child? ,"
See I posted this on different forums so I hope I’m not in the wrong here. This a throwaway account. Sorry I had to repost in a better way and add more details. 

This girl swears up and down my husband is the boy father. We will nickname this girl”Nikki” He told his mom it wasn’t his and his mom side of the family said it wasn’t his either. His sister said the baby don’t look nothing like him at all. 

So his sister talked with her and she volunteered to even help out. his sister never heard from Nikki again either. She texted Nikki and asked for a DNA test. She changed her number. 

Okay Nikki called my husband phone from her new number and he requested to take a DNA test. Nikki would keep changing her number and call his dad phone number. At this point, Nikki was gone for 3 entire years after that. 

He told his dad it was his child when he asked him. His father said he hasn’t heard from Nikki  in a while now. she stayed on his phone every night talking about my husband isn’t doing anything for the child. I asked my husband about this and he said something is mentally wrong with her. I seen the text message where he asked for a DNA test and she didn’t wanna take one. 


His father fought for the child to have some of my husband money, and now she has disappeared again. He believed that the child was his, but now he don’t know what to believe anymore.  My husband father kept pressuring my husband to take care of the child. So my husband father told her about the option about child support. She declined and he knew that it required a DNA test.  I tried to call Nikki and her number is disconnected again. 

 I told him that I want a court ordered DNA test and he is still  willing to take one. his daddy said that he hasn’t heard from her in a while and she stopped calling him. 

Nikki went from calling his daddy every night to not calling him at all. Years ago I called her and she told me the baby was his. Told his auntie it wasn’t. Now I called the exact same number and it’s disconnected. Nikki has now disappeared again. I been trying to make contact with Nikki over the years and she keeps disappearing when it comes to a DNA test.  

She won’t talk to me or his mom. She stayed calling his daddy. I’ve been ignoring Nikki over the years because she keeps avoiding a DNA test. 

Nikki told his dad that every time she ask my husband to buy pampers or something for the child, he responds with “give me some ass” or “you gone give me some ass”. Nikki told his dad that my husband wouldn’t do nothing for the baby unless she gave him some ass. Nikki also told his dad that she was pregnant by my husband before, but had a miscarriage. 

Nikki called my husband phone but won’t respond to me, his mom, or sister requesting a DNA test.  I ignored Nikki over the years because she was gone for almost 4 years. I want my husband to take a dna test. I mentioned this before and she disappears. I don’t wanna be the asshole in this situation by tracking her down myself. 

Nikki told my husband father that the boy is almost 8 years old now. My husband father told her about DNA test or child support. He even offered to help as the sister did and Nikki hasn’t been heard from since. 

I asked my father in law about Nikki recently and she hasn’t called him in MONTHS. he said she hasn’t heard from her. 

I just want a freaking DNA test…not a disappearing person who keeps disappearing when being asked.

It already doesn't sound good, but listen. My mom knows I play video games often and gives me grace when I say I'm not done with matches. This was the first time I didn't put away groceries to finish my video game, but today was her breaking point, and she banned me from joining them in the pool. I was in an intense match before I was called to bring the groceries inside from the car, which I did. So then I promptly resumed playing. I messed up this part because I needed to remember to return to finish putting them away. When I was called to put them away, she came in with a snarking, ""You must be forgetting to do your part in this house, huh?"" which was irritating bc she didn't have to do that, so that was irritating. I would say, ""I'm in a match,"" but I chose not to because I had already ditched them to finish my previous one. So I made a face when she said, ""You must be forgetting to do your part in this house, huh?"" but I chose not to say anything and remained quiet. Was that wrong? Because once I got up, she was like, ""Oh! Never mind, since you want to have an attitude!"" ??? I chased her so she could explain, and her explanation was, ""Because of that face you made, go back and finish your little game."" I know I couldn't go and help put them away because the last time I tried to do that, she lectured me on the spot, so I just went back to my room. I was already dressed to swim before my mom came in and said, I can't go anymore.

I tried to get her reasoning, and she said, ""Since you didn't help, this is your consequence."" I got agitated because I did not get up to put the groceries away. So she and my sister went to the pool, and I decided to go after them on my bike to talk it out. It was an intense conversation, but I can sum it up by her saying, ""I pay the bills; since you thought your game was more important than helping me out with the groceries, this is your punishment. Think about that the next time you get an attitude."" I may be overreacting; my friends said to let it be water under the bridge. But this is making me fume.

6,1dutzrw,AITA for not giving up the master bedroom when I haven’t had it,"I (23m) have lived in college with 3 other guys making 4 of us total. We lived together for 2 years where in that time I dropped out for a year, and had to pay my own rent because that was part of my parents deal. I understand that this is a good deal and I have been blessed to have parents that can afford that as is. But, when we moved in to that apartment i got the worst room. it was the smallest and downstairs where you can hear everyone walking above you, anyone leave or enter the apartment, anyone in the kitchen to make food, and shared a wall with the living room so anytime people were over I could always hear them. In that time I occasionally mentioned how my room wasn’t the best, but that was the most of it. after 2 years me and one of those guys moved to a 2 bedroom leaving behind the other 2 because they had to live at home for other reasons. This year has been great and the guy i’m with is my best friend, so we agree and get along 99% of the time. Fast forward to now, and we are about to move for the last year of college and move in with 1 new guy and 1 from the old unit. The originally plan was for me to get the master downstairs if we got a different floor plan, and i never agreed to be downstairs if we got the old floor plan. Well, as you can imagine of course we got the old floor plan and now we have these problems. I am assigned in the master upstairs with a balcony, and the new guy coming in thinks he deserves the master more. As i started going to college again my parents began paying again, and he thinks since he is out of college and paying his own way he should get the master. I believe that since i was assigned this unit i should get it, and i have already sacrificed having a bad room before. also when i paid to be on my own i didn’t demand a better room either i stayed. he has always lived at home where his mom and dad provide and he should be happy to just move out in my opinion. He has stated that he should also get the bigger room to accommodate all his stuff from home, but i had to sacrifice and leave stuff behind when i had the smaller room. My friend offered a suggestion of me being in a different upstairs bedroom, the new guy getting the master, and the other 2 sort out who gets what. there was no guarantee i would even get the master but now that i have it, i dont want to just give it up lol. my other roommates said they understand where i am coming from but that i should give it up and that i am being petty. since i disagreed the new guy has made it a point to tell all people we are common friends with that “i am screwing him over.” he also has gotten everyone else to approach me about it and wont even directly talk to me about it. he just keeps saying he deserves it since he is paying and not his parents and that he needs more space. originally he would’ve been fine with not having the master if we got the different floor plan.

But, when we moved in to that apartment i got the worst room. it was the smallest and downstairs where you can hear everyone walking above you, anyone leave or enter the apartment, anyone in the kitchen to make food, and shared a wall with the living room so anytime people were over I could always hear them. In that time I occasionally mentioned how my room wasn’t the best, but that was the most of it. after 2 years me and one of those guys moved to a 2 bedroom leaving behind the other 2 because they had to live at home for other reasons. This year has been great and the guy i’m with is my best friend, so we agree and get along 99% of the time. Fast forward to now, and we are about to move for the last year of college and move in with 1 new guy and 1 from the old unit. The originally plan was for me to get the master downstairs if we got a different floor plan, and i never agreed to be downstairs if we got the old floor plan. Well, as you can imagine of course we got the old floor plan and now we have these problems. I am assigned in the master upstairs with a balcony, and the new guy coming in thinks he deserves the master more. As i started going to college again my parents began paying again, and he thinks since he is out of college and paying his own way he should get the master. I believe that since i was assigned this unit i should get it, and i have already sacrificed having a bad room before. also when i paid to be on my own i didn’t demand a better room either i stayed. he has always lived at home where his mom and dad provide and he should be happy to just move out in my opinion. He has stated that he should also get the bigger room to accommodate all his stuff from home, but i had to sacrifice and leave stuff behind when i had the smaller room. My friend offered a suggestion of me being in a different upstairs bedroom, the new guy getting the master, and the other 2 sort out who gets what. there was no guarantee i would even get the master but now that i have it, i dont want to just give it up lol. my other roommates said they understand where i am coming from but that i should give it up and that i am being petty. since i disagreed the new guy has made it a point to tell all people we are common friends with that “i am screwing him over.” he also has gotten everyone else to approach me about it and wont even directly talk to me about it. he just keeps saying he deserves it since he is paying and not his parents and that he needs more space. originally he would’ve been fine with not having the master if we got the different floor plan. AITA because everyone says i’m the one being petty.",0.0,1.0416042,1,0

So today I showed up to the gig for the patriotic concert for July 4th and I set up my stand and all my music. I put the stand rather close to my face because I’m legally blind so I can’t see far away. Then my stand partner shows up about 5 minutes before the concert starts and pulls the stand toward him. So I say, “Steve (fake name) can you put the stand a little more towards me since I’m legally blind?” Steve respondes with, “You can’t be legally blind you’re still a child.” I reply, “I’m 16 and I can’t see the music so I hope you would find in the kindness of your heart to help me out a little.”  He proceeds to move the top of the stand so it facing him. 

By this point the concert has already started so I play the first 2 pieces without being able to see most of the music. Then I move the third piece onto the stand and turn it toward me so I can see.

9,1dutr7a,AITA- Moving Out Edition,"I (F25) have been thinking about moving out with my boyfriend by the end of next year.

Growing up in an immigrant family, I have a sense of guilt about leaving. My dad never contributed much financially due to past debts, bringing in about $200 bucks bi-weekly. My mom shoulders a lot of responsibility, so I help out by up-keeping the house and cooking most evenings to ensure everyone, including my grandpa, has dinner. Recently, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and as the only able-bodied person who can assist, I've been supporting him through his treatment. That's why I've decided to wait until the end of next year before actively searching for a place, until at least my dad's health stabilizes. Between my dad's illness, work, and family obligations, I'm exhausted. At 25, I don't think I should feel this overwhelmed/drained, but sometimes I wonder if I'm being selfish for wanting to live my own life. Currently, I commute about an hour almost daily from New Jersey to Manhattan for various reasons, which is why my move makes sense. 

I've shared my plans with family. They're supportive overall but my dad questioned my decision, asking if I'm already tired of family. His reaction got me feeling conflicted. AITA?

10,1dutowc,AITA for messaging my long-lost cousin? ,"I (19F) have known that I've had a cousin on my dad's side of the family for a while now. My dad has two siblings (my aunt and uncle). My aunt has two kids, my cousins who I get along with very well. They're both adopted, just for reference, but they've never felt less like family to me. My uncle, on the other hand, has been sort of a mysterious character to say the least. He hasn't shown up for a family reunion for  more than 10 years, and when our grandpa passed he finally came, although he said he had his reasons, including a lot of mental health issues. Not to get into too much detail, but we found out his son (let's call him B) he had from a divorced marriage is now suing him for not paying child support or misusing something, although it was thrown out for lack of evidence. I don't know much detail, and my parents don't like to get into it, but all we know is that B's mom divorced my uncle when B was a toddler, took him away from my uncle for some reason and poisoned her son to hate his dad. I don't know if this is true or not, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's the case, as B is literally suing is own dad...overall, our entire family thinks this is a really sad case.

What I selfishly can't seem to get over is that I wanted to connect with B as he is my biological cousin and when I saw his photo on a social media site, I felt like we had so many similarities. My parents would always compare me to my uncle, both personality and trait wise, and when I showed my dad a photo of B he said ""that looks just like my brother when he was young."" B and I look like we could be siblings. He is around 8 years older than me for reference. I've always wondered about B and felt a pang in my chest, thinking that if this incident didn't go down, we would really have a familial connection. My dad told me before B's mom took him, the family got to meet and hold him. I also found out B tried to call his dad years ago (my uncle) but he just hung up. While I love my uncle, he definitely is an aloof character, and my dad told me stories about him that were kind of weird. I also still can't get over the fact that he hasn't visited us in ten years, I get that he was under stress especially when B was suing him, but the rest of our family makes an effort to get together.

Anyways, the part where I'm wondering I messed up. I recently found B's phone number from an ancestry truthfinder website I visited, tracked his Facebook account to message him, and I told him simply who I was and that the door was open if he wanted to connect just as cousins.

Aaron and his family are visiting our mom, so I'm taking my son to visit as well. My husband and our oldest (a preteen) are staying home.

Mom bought her house eight years ago, and ""gave"" Aaron the very large basement bedroom in the hopes he would have a kid soon and need the space. I received a much smaller room upstairs. Neither of us have ever lived there with her. When my SIL was pregnant, Mom did set up the crib in their room. However, his son has never slept in a crib by their choice, and whenever they've visited he's actually slept on a floor mattress in Mom's room. My son slept first in a bassinet but when he moved to a crib, I've always used Aaron's room instead and my son sleeps in the crib there,; Aaron and SIL sleep in my room.

I wouldn't mind if the crib could go into my room, because just me and my son are going (it's impossible when me, hubby, preteen, baby, and 80 pound dog all visit), but the crib literally cannot fit in there, so he would be put... somewhere else?
