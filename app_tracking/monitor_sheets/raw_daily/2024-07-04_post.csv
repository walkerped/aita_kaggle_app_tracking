Well my step dad finally unblocked me on fb after blocking me back in December over the fact that I made a decision to stay with my hubby after something we went through. My mom on the other hand has barely texted me at all especially regarding my baby. Now I don't and never expected her to talk to me abt my baby but I figured most parents of children who are having their grandchildren, maybe wanna ask questions abt the grand baby. Now I keep low contact with my parents due to the childhood abuse they had put me through so neither of them have my phone number. But my problem is, they think they can be in my baby's life and mine after disowning me bc of the decisions I made while being with hubby. They had previously told me back when I was 18 that if I were to become pregnant, they wanted nothing to do with my baby. Now I found a post back from when I found out that I was pregnant that my step dad posted while he had me blocked. It was him mentioning how he is a grandpa and my mother is a grandma. Now the only thing my mom has asked me abt my baby was the gender. After that I haven't received a single message from her. But the only person I have that's going to be a grandpa on my side is my bio dad, he's been nothing but been an amazing help especially with my baby and myself. Now I believe the only reason my step dad unblocked me was bc I started calling my bio dad ""dad"" and not him. The only reason I think this is bc in a conversation I had with my mom, I called my bio dad ""dad"" and she kept calling my step dad, my dad when she referred to him.

2,1duuau0,"AITA : For criticizing her boyfriend as she did, and talking about my late best friend ?","*English is not my first language.*

I (25 M) lost my best friend three months ago. I was (and still is) living in hell.

One day, I wanted to talk about her.

Carol (25 F) said : ""Sorry I don’t have the energy to talk about it right now"", and then sends me texts about her situationship. I try other days. Her : ""Huh, I would have liked a TW about depression"". I understood. This was a difficult topic for her. One day, she told me all about her existential questions, and didn't mince her word talking about death. The funeral of my friend was, in my mind : seconds ago. I didn't need a brutal reminder about how cruel death was. I just wanted to talk about my best friend. No her death.

Weeks later Carol invited me to the first gig of Boyfriend. While she and I were eating, I said : "" That was really good, especially for a first show ! The guitarist was not always in time, but with the anxiety it’s normal, this was great !"".

Later, we were planning to go to the bar together. She texts : ""I will go with another person, and if that person is not available, I will not go with you"".

I asked : ""why ? Is there any problem with me ?"" She answered : ""Yes.  
-- So what is the problem ?""  
Next day she refuses to tell me what the problem was and instead said that I was exercising pressure on her with my grief…

The problem : she felt that I was talking about Boyfriend negatively (especially in what I said about his gig). Me : « That’s very hypocritical coming from you.  
– I’m in the right to talk about my Boyfriend, not you, » she said.



So, I decided to express that the Boyfriend problem was too much for me considering what i’m traversing. And that there was no emotional balance between Carol and I.

She told me there was, because that she was listening to my problems. But no. So I stood my ground and asked : “why did you speak in such detail about death if you knew I just lost someone and was not recovering from that ? Was I the best person to talk to about that ?

She said : ""Did you think I was serious ? Did you get worried about me because I was talking about death ? Don’t worry ! I have friends much closer than you ; if I want to talk, I can join them. You, I join you only when my friends are not available. So I'll talk to them. ""  
She said that this was my fault if I was worrying, since she hadn’t spoken about not being well for a week. ""No news is good news"". She stated: this is not her responsibility to give news. In the contrary this is my responsibility to check if she is OK, if I’m worried.

The discussion concluded when I said that in regard to what I was traversing, I found that she didn’t take my situation in consideration and was just dumping all of her problems without ever giving a shit about what I feel.

She admitted : “This is true, when I speak to you, I don’t take in consideration that you are grieving for your friends"".

This ended up there.

3,1duu9cc,AITA if I don’t pay the house cleaner?,"We hired a house cleaner to do a one time deep clean of our new home before we move in and after we finished a small construction project. Everything seemed great initially with their communication and they had been recommended locally so I had confidence in them (turns out those that recommended this person were family members). They let me know when they were finished and sent me an invoice. Based on the text messages of when they arrived and finished it appears they were at the house for 2.5-3 hours. I arrived to the house about an hour after they were finished and was so disappointed to see the outcome. I could not find any evidence that anything had been cleaned. The floors were still full of marks, dust on surfaces, blinds in the same position, trash in the kitchen and no smell of any cleaning products at all. The house is vacant but we do have a few gift baskets that were given to us when we closed on the house in the kitchen. All of these things were in the exact same position, nothing had been moved (for reference these things weren’t arranged decoratively they were just kind of on the counter so it isn’t just like the cleaner put them back in the exact same spot). I gave the cleaner a call to express my concern and inquire if there was miscommunication on what had been asked. They just said they could come back and clean the floors or take 50% off the $300+ bill. I asked for clarification on what was cleaned and they didn’t really say anything just said they spent several hours at my house. I said I wasn’t comfortable paying the bill because I was quite confident little to nothing had actually been cleaned and though they may have been present in my home there was no evidence of work being done.

4,1duu8wb,AITA for wanting my husband to take a DNA test on a possible child? ,"
See I posted this on different forums so I hope I’m not in the wrong here. This a throwaway account. Sorry I had to repost in a better way and add more details. 

This girl swears up and down my husband is the boy father. We will nickname this girl”Nikki” He told his mom it wasn’t his and his mom side of the family said it wasn’t his either. His sister said the baby don’t look nothing like him at all. 

So his sister talked with her and she volunteered to even help out. his sister never heard from Nikki again either. She texted Nikki and asked for a DNA test. She changed her number. 

Okay Nikki called my husband phone from her new number and he requested to take a DNA test. Nikki would keep changing her number and call his dad phone number. At this point, Nikki was gone for 3 entire years after that. 

He told his dad it was his child when he asked him. His father said he hasn’t heard from Nikki  in a while now. she stayed on his phone every night talking about my husband isn’t doing anything for the child. I asked my husband about this and he said something is mentally wrong with her. I seen the text message where he asked for a DNA test and she didn’t wanna take one. 


His father fought for the child to have some of my husband money, and now she has disappeared again. He believed that the child was his, but now he don’t know what to believe anymore.  My husband father kept pressuring my husband to take care of the child. So my husband father told her about the option about child support. She declined and he knew that it required a DNA test.  I tried to call Nikki and her number is disconnected again. 

 I told him that I want a court ordered DNA test and he is still  willing to take one. his daddy said that he hasn’t heard from her in a while and she stopped calling him. 

Nikki went from calling his daddy every night to not calling him at all. Years ago I called her and she told me the baby was his. Told his auntie it wasn’t. Now I called the exact same number and it’s disconnected. Nikki has now disappeared again. I been trying to make contact with Nikki over the years and she keeps disappearing when it comes to a DNA test.  

She won’t talk to me or his mom. She stayed calling his daddy. I’ve been ignoring Nikki over the years because she keeps avoiding a DNA test. 

Nikki told his dad that every time she ask my husband to buy pampers or something for the child, he responds with “give me some ass” or “you gone give me some ass”. Nikki told his dad that my husband wouldn’t do nothing for the baby unless she gave him some ass. Nikki also told his dad that she was pregnant by my husband before, but had a miscarriage. 

Nikki called my husband phone but won’t respond to me, his mom, or sister requesting a DNA test.  I ignored Nikki over the years because she was gone for almost 4 years. I want my husband to take a dna test. I mentioned this before and she disappears. I don’t wanna be the asshole in this situation by tracking her down myself. 

Nikki told my husband father that the boy is almost 8 years old now. My husband father told her about DNA test or child support. He even offered to help as the sister did and Nikki hasn’t been heard from since. 

I asked my father in law about Nikki recently and she hasn’t called him in MONTHS. he said she hasn’t heard from her. 

I just want a freaking DNA test…not a disappearing person who keeps disappearing when being asked.

It already doesn't sound good, but listen. My mom knows I play video games often and gives me grace when I say I'm not done with matches. This was the first time I didn't put away groceries to finish my video game, but today was her breaking point, and she banned me from joining them in the pool. I was in an intense match before I was called to bring the groceries inside from the car, which I did. So then I promptly resumed playing. I messed up this part because I needed to remember to return to finish putting them away. When I was called to put them away, she came in with a snarking, ""You must be forgetting to do your part in this house, huh?"" which was irritating bc she didn't have to do that, so that was irritating. I would say, ""I'm in a match,"" but I chose not to because I had already ditched them to finish my previous one. So I made a face when she said, ""You must be forgetting to do your part in this house, huh?"" but I chose not to say anything and remained quiet. Was that wrong? Because once I got up, she was like, ""Oh! Never mind, since you want to have an attitude!"" ??? I chased her so she could explain, and her explanation was, ""Because of that face you made, go back and finish your little game."" I know I couldn't go and help put them away because the last time I tried to do that, she lectured me on the spot, so I just went back to my room. I was already dressed to swim before my mom came in and said, I can't go anymore.

I tried to get her reasoning, and she said, ""Since you didn't help, this is your consequence."" I got agitated because I did not get up to put the groceries away. So she and my sister went to the pool, and I decided to go after them on my bike to talk it out. It was an intense conversation, but I can sum it up by her saying, ""I pay the bills; since you thought your game was more important than helping me out with the groceries, this is your punishment. Think about that the next time you get an attitude."" I may be overreacting; my friends said to let it be water under the bridge. But this is making me fume.

6,1dutzrw,AITA for not giving up the master bedroom when I haven’t had it,"I (23m) have lived in college with 3 other guys making 4 of us total. We lived together for 2 years where in that time I dropped out for a year, and had to pay my own rent because that was part of my parents deal. I understand that this is a good deal and I have been blessed to have parents that can afford that as is. But, when we moved in to that apartment i got the worst room. it was the smallest and downstairs where you can hear everyone walking above you, anyone leave or enter the apartment, anyone in the kitchen to make food, and shared a wall with the living room so anytime people were over I could always hear them. In that time I occasionally mentioned how my room wasn’t the best, but that was the most of it. after 2 years me and one of those guys moved to a 2 bedroom leaving behind the other 2 because they had to live at home for other reasons. This year has been great and the guy i’m with is my best friend, so we agree and get along 99% of the time. Fast forward to now, and we are about to move for the last year of college and move in with 1 new guy and 1 from the old unit. The originally plan was for me to get the master downstairs if we got a different floor plan, and i never agreed to be downstairs if we got the old floor plan. Well, as you can imagine of course we got the old floor plan and now we have these problems. I am assigned in the master upstairs with a balcony, and the new guy coming in thinks he deserves the master more. As i started going to college again my parents began paying again, and he thinks since he is out of college and paying his own way he should get the master. I believe that since i was assigned this unit i should get it, and i have already sacrificed having a bad room before. also when i paid to be on my own i didn’t demand a better room either i stayed. he has always lived at home where his mom and dad provide and he should be happy to just move out in my opinion. He has stated that he should also get the bigger room to accommodate all his stuff from home, but i had to sacrifice and leave stuff behind when i had the smaller room. My friend offered a suggestion of me being in a different upstairs bedroom, the new guy getting the master, and the other 2 sort out who gets what. there was no guarantee i would even get the master but now that i have it, i dont want to just give it up lol. my other roommates said they understand where i am coming from but that i should give it up and that i am being petty. since i disagreed the new guy has made it a point to tell all people we are common friends with that “i am screwing him over.” he also has gotten everyone else to approach me about it and wont even directly talk to me about it. he just keeps saying he deserves it since he is paying and not his parents and that he needs more space. originally he would’ve been fine with not having the master if we got the different floor plan.

But, when we moved in to that apartment i got the worst room. it was the smallest and downstairs where you can hear everyone walking above you, anyone leave or enter the apartment, anyone in the kitchen to make food, and shared a wall with the living room so anytime people were over I could always hear them. In that time I occasionally mentioned how my room wasn’t the best, but that was the most of it. after 2 years me and one of those guys moved to a 2 bedroom leaving behind the other 2 because they had to live at home for other reasons. This year has been great and the guy i’m with is my best friend, so we agree and get along 99% of the time. Fast forward to now, and we are about to move for the last year of college and move in with 1 new guy and 1 from the old unit. The originally plan was for me to get the master downstairs if we got a different floor plan, and i never agreed to be downstairs if we got the old floor plan. Well, as you can imagine of course we got the old floor plan and now we have these problems. I am assigned in the master upstairs with a balcony, and the new guy coming in thinks he deserves the master more. As i started going to college again my parents began paying again, and he thinks since he is out of college and paying his own way he should get the master. I believe that since i was assigned this unit i should get it, and i have already sacrificed having a bad room before. also when i paid to be on my own i didn’t demand a better room either i stayed. he has always lived at home where his mom and dad provide and he should be happy to just move out in my opinion. He has stated that he should also get the bigger room to accommodate all his stuff from home, but i had to sacrifice and leave stuff behind when i had the smaller room. My friend offered a suggestion of me being in a different upstairs bedroom, the new guy getting the master, and the other 2 sort out who gets what. there was no guarantee i would even get the master but now that i have it, i dont want to just give it up lol. my other roommates said they understand where i am coming from but that i should give it up and that i am being petty. since i disagreed the new guy has made it a point to tell all people we are common friends with that “i am screwing him over.” he also has gotten everyone else to approach me about it and wont even directly talk to me about it. he just keeps saying he deserves it since he is paying and not his parents and that he needs more space. originally he would’ve been fine with not having the master if we got the different floor plan. AITA because everyone says i’m the one being petty.",0.0,1.0416042,1,0

Growing up in an immigrant family, I have a sense of guilt about leaving. My dad never contributed much financially due to past debts, bringing in about $200 bucks bi-weekly. My mom shoulders a lot of responsibility, so I help out by up-keeping the house and cooking most evenings to ensure everyone, including my grandpa, has dinner. Recently, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and as the only able-bodied person who can assist, I've been supporting him through his treatment.

Between my dad's illness, work, and family obligations, I'm exhausted. At 25, I don't think I should feel this overwhelmed/drained, but sometimes I wonder if I'm being selfish for wanting to live my own life.

10,1dutowc,AITA for messaging my long-lost cousin? ,"I (19F) have known that I've had a cousin on my dad's side of the family for a while now. My dad has two siblings (my aunt and uncle). My aunt has two kids, my cousins who I get along with very well. They're both adopted, just for reference, but they've never felt less like family to me. My uncle, on the other hand, has been sort of a mysterious character to say the least. He hasn't shown up for a family reunion for  more than 10 years, and when our grandpa passed he finally came, although he said he had his reasons, including a lot of mental health issues. Not to get into too much detail, but we found out his son (let's call him B) he had from a divorced marriage is now suing him for not paying child support or misusing something, although it was thrown out for lack of evidence. I don't know much detail, and my parents don't like to get into it, but all we know is that B's mom divorced my uncle when B was a toddler, took him away from my uncle for some reason and poisoned her son to hate his dad. I don't know if this is true or not, but it seems pretty clear to me that it's the case, as B is literally suing is own dad...overall, our entire family thinks this is a really sad case.

What I selfishly can't seem to get over is that I wanted to connect with B as he is my biological cousin and when I saw his photo on a social media site, I felt like we had so many similarities. My parents would always compare me to my uncle, both personality and trait wise, and when I showed my dad a photo of B he said ""that looks just like my brother when he was young."" B and I look like we could be siblings. He is around 8 years older than me for reference. I've always wondered about B and felt a pang in my chest, thinking that if this incident didn't go down, we would really have a familial connection. My dad told me before B's mom took him, the family got to meet and hold him. I also found out B tried to call his dad years ago (my uncle) but he just hung up. While I love my uncle, he definitely is an aloof character, and my dad told me stories about him that were kind of weird. I also still can't get over the fact that he hasn't visited us in ten years, I get that he was under stress especially when B was suing him, but the rest of our family makes an effort to get together.

12,1dvkqq4,AITA for putting supplies in a bathroom cabinet ,"I(27F) live in a house with 4 other girls (ages 22-25). Two of them are away for the summer, so there are only three of us at the moment. I just moved in this last April. 

The 4 other girls have lived together in this house for a few years. I am new to the city and rented a room that was available in this house. When I moved in, there was absolutely no room for my stuff anywhere. No kitchen space, no fridge space, etc. Essentially, the common areas were over flowing with their stuff. I had to shove my way in. 

There are two bathrooms. One upstairs and one downstairs in the basement. 4 of us have our rooms upstairs, while one is downstairs. Right now, the two girls who are away for the summer are upstairs with me and my other roommate. 

When I moved in, the girl upstairs had asked me if I was okay to use the downstairs basement bathroom. I agreed, not thinking much of it. However, while using the bathroom for a month, a few issues started popping up. First off, it's down two flights of stairs and just going to brush my teeth for the night is inconvenient. Second, there are TONS of bugs. I mean tons. It's really bad for my anxiety. I'm talking centipedes, spiders, silverfish, etc. 

For these reasons, I told them I would be using the upstairs bathroom. Her and the other girl who is away (but they are dating) were reluctant because they said there wasn't room for my stuff. To cooperate, I said I would keep my shower supplies in my room. Now, this bathroom is exactly like the rest of the house. Absolutely jam packed of items, garbage, skincare, etc. Honestly it's a lot of junk that isn't organized well. The one cabinet has three shelves that could be 50% cleared out. While I keep my shower supplies in my room, I see no reason to keep my teeth, face wash, sanitary products, etc in my room. So, I reorganized the bottom shelf and put my stuff there. 

Now, two days ago I come back to find my stuff has been moved off the shelf and replaced with someone else's stuff that wasn't there before. My items had been randomly placed around the messy cabinet in disarray. So, I took it upon myself to clear out some of the junk and replace my items. I put the junk (expired products, tape, a wine glass, a dead candle) on the toilet seat. I've come back home today to find a few of my items moved and the junk placed ontop of my stuff. Don't ask me why they need to keep expired products or a dead candle....from my understanding, this house has never had a spring cleaning. 

I don't want to have a silent battle of wills, but this is irritating me. I would keep all the stuff in my room, however, I pay rent for the common areas just like everyone else. Also, we all pay the same rent and my room is half the size of theirs (which I didnt know prior to moving in). I understand I originally said I'd use the downstairs bathroom, but it's inconvenient, not ideal, and the bugs make me beyond anxious.

Their so called family dinner disguised as a date only consisted of her talking to the man with a ""Hi"" and ""Let me get your number"" and to his sister a ""Hi"" and a ""Thank You."" The dinner was at a large round table and my family sat on one side and the other family sat on the other side with the man in question on the opposite side. This is why I told her to be adamant about not going because I figured something like this would happen. It has happened in the past where we would go to parties that I always say no to but end up getting forced and then get seated to some random strangers table or away from my cousin. This is why I talk back to my parents...

Happy July 4th everyone! I got a pretty last minute request to go to a so called ""Family Dinner"" that is really a disguise that my dad did setting up my sister for a date. Both families of both parties are attending. We are Asian by the way and I am not sure how Asian cultures work with these kind of things because this shit is weird. I say pretty last minute because it was last night.

My mom told me to go to that dinner and I told her that I am not going because I do not want to and she replies saying that she wants me to go to ""morally support"" my sister. Mind you, I am 25 and she is 27. I'm like this doesn't really have anything to do with me since it is a set up for her and why are you guys even setting up a date for her anyways? Let her choose, you can't just choose someone you like because you like them. My mom was like your sister has mental problems.

Little backstory, my sister does have little mental problems, she went to a psychologist a few years ago, about 3 to 4 and she was diagnosed with some kind of disorder that makes her childish or something. I believe this is why my mom wants me to go.

So fast forward to late afternoon today. My mom calls me and tells me to start getting ready. I'm like I'm not going, this has nothing to do with me and I have no reason to be there since it's a set up for my sister. She tells me that I don't care about this family, I only care about myself, I don't care for others. She says you have bad qualities and this is one of them. You do know that don't you? I just stayed silent and didn't bother answering. She then proceeded again to say just for today, she (my sister) needs you. I'm like no, I have no reason to go. She proceeds to say the same thing in a different way and gets upset. She is like fine, whatever, you don't care about this family at all and then I hang up.

My grandma comes down a little while later and she is like what are you going to eat? I'm like I don't know, I'll figure something out. I ask her if she knows about the dinner and she is like yeah but I'm not going because this doesn't need to involve me, it's all about those two. I'm like that's exactly what I said to mom and told her what she said to me on the phone. Grandma is like your mom is insane, this doesn't need you, you are only needed when the right time comes which is much later in the future when your sister starts getting to know the man better and brings him home.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-04,"AITA for not going to a ""Family Dinner"" that is really a date in disguise for my sister? EDIT : So I asked my sister about the dinner. I would say it was an awful experience. Their so called family dinner disguised as a date only consisted of her talking to the man with a ""Hi"" and ""Let me get your number"" and to his sister a ""Hi"" and a ""Thank You."" The dinner was at a large round table and my family sat on one side and the other family sat on the other side with the man in question on the opposite side. This is why I told her to be adamant about not going because I figured something like this would happen. It has happened in the past where we would go to parties that I always say no to but end up getting forced and then get seated to some random strangers table or away from my cousin. This is why I talk back to my parents...

15,1dvivsn,AITA for getting high at my sister’s wedding?,"Hi everyone. I'm using an anonymous account here because people I know follow me. I'm 22M and in the UK btw, but I don't think this will affect the post it's just for context.

My sister (31F) has been planning her wedding for the past year. We're not very close and we've had a lot of issues in the past, so she was mainly inviting me just to be polite I think. We've had issues because I've had drug problems since I was about 15, and I used to make her pick me up from sketchy places in my town when I was high for example, and she saw me at some really low points in my life. She said that I could come if I promised I wouldn't get high, and even then she really had to convince my BIL to let me attend because he doesn't like me at all.

I had honestly been doing really good lately, and I haven't gotten high in a few months. I made a really good plan with my sister, and I knew that if I wanted to get high then I could just tell her and she'd get my parents or something. The thing is, on the day I didn't know my old friend would be there and we were catching up for a while. Eventually he offered me coke and I felt bad if he did it alone. I honestly wasn't thinking of my sister at all and I feel bad for getting wrapped up in the moment, but I was obviously high when I was talking to my BIL and he noticed and told me to leave because ""I can't even follow through on one fucking promise"" and he thinks I'm a really bad person for lying. I wasn't lying and I was genuinely trying, I told him this but he wasn't listening he just kept being like ""okay buddy it's time to go"".

I don't think anyone noticed I left anyway but in the morning my parents told me that they weren't talking to me for the foreseeable future and that I've really hurt my sister now. AITA? My sister won't answer my calls either. I have genuinely really been trying, and I feel bad for throwing it away but I don't think my family should be cutting me off over a mistake. They haven't acknowledged that I've been sober these past few months too, and I would've really appreciated some encouragement.

16,1dviixh,AITA for arguing with a girl who is an ex member from our friend group?,"For context, the ex member has been rude to the friend group by talking about problems that other people have struggles with, disrupting them when occupied, and ignoring boundaries. She also has a history of watching NSFW content.

The ex member, called Carol, was asking if anyone wanted to join her game but I told her to be quiet after seeking attention. Then I accused her of using an alt account with evidence included for the game. After a long time of her providing that it wasn't her alt, she eventually gave in. She claims she wanted to play the game normally because her main was banned but I still got mad at her for what she did to my friend group. She then explained that she did not care for the friend group in the first place. I talked bad about her to many other people to explain why no one should be with someone who is like her so she would have less chances of getting friends. Carol said she did not care if I talked bad about her because she claims she has other friends and a job that she has to worry about. I said that she was a liar and that her life was falling apart because of her addiction to NSFW content. Carol started saying that I was mad because of my own problems and that I was taking it out on her, which lead to her insulting my partner's life problems and saying I spoil my partner. I got mad and called her out that she is a horrible person and told her to get fired from her job.

17,1dviilk,AITA for buying my own set of cutleries in my fiance’s family house,"Fiance and I are currently living at his mother’s house for a good 4 months now. His mom is recently widowed and got a massive house so invited her kids to come live with her again for a bit so she can have company and we can also save some money in this economy.

I had my misgivings because we’ve been enjoying our own place for more than 2 years at this point but he wanted to be there for his mom as his stepdad’s life ended in a very unfortunate circumstance. My partner also wanted to study so saving in rent is a good financial respite as he’ll be working less. We’ve deemed this situation to be a maximum 2 years arrangement.

Adjusting to the house was such a difficult time for me. The house has 2 cats, 2 dogs and they can be very feral. All pets go in and out of the house as well. I grew up with a dog, but a very groomed weekly cleaned dog. We also had house help to deal with it so I don’t really have much experience in cleaning up after pets. The house understandably is always in a state of mess with all the pets and 6 adults sharing a house.

Since the 4 months I’ve been here, I haven’t seen the dogs get showered/cleaned up. The dogs are also known to eat their own shit and shit and pee inside the house then step on it and walk around their shitty paws. I have to move all my stuff from the floor every night to make sure they don’t get shitted/pissed on before I go to bed. Yes it has happened many times. It grosses me out so much. The mom cleans up of course but not really my stuff when it gets soiled. :(

I’m at my wits end. I recently saw the mom giving some of her food to the dogs using her spoon. We do use a dishwasher but you know how sometimes the dishwasher doesn’t get it all and there would still be crumbs stuck? I wanna vommit with the thought I might have stuck something in my mouth that got dog shit on it. Her kids have already expressed the dogs shouldn’t be inside but she doesn’t really listen. Her house, her rules I understand.

I’ve been telling my partner to move out already but I can also see how much it means to him to be with his whole family again. Opportunities like that don’t really happen too much in adulthood. So what I’ve done was to buy my own set of cutleries (2 spoons, 2 forks, 2 teaspoons) and handwash them, easy peasy I can help myself.

Well apparently it was very offensive to my partner’s mom. I didn’t really communicate my disgust with the whole cutleries to dogs thing but we had past history where my standard of living is very different from my partner’s family so I just didn’t want to add drama again when I think we’ve put it past us finally.

I really really want to keep using my own cutleries and I don’t think it’s a big deal. But does it reek of condecension and passive aggressiveness as the mom and partner’s sibling has said?

My son had been wanting to go on the boys trip for months and my Husband and I finally made the plans for it. Once they left, I told my daughter “let’s go to the mall.” She got all excited which made me excited and we hopped in the car. 

We went to Bath and Body Works and I got her a candle. And we went to American Eagle and she wanted a pair of jeans and earrings, so I got them for her. Then lastly, we got Starbucks after I took her to Ulta to get her a new mascara. 

I wanted to treat her since we couldn’t go on a vacation. She was super happy and grateful. I wanted to use my promotion for good.

Once the boys got home my daughter was so excited to show her brother what she got. And he got so upset that she got all these cool things and he got nothing. My husband also said that I shouldn’t get her all of these things and that it’s not fair to my son. They had went on a week long vacation. I don’t want my family to pick sides.

19,1dvi1vn,AITA for not progressing with my friends in a game?,"I know this post isn't all that serious, but I am quite sensitive about these things, and I genuinely want to make sure I'm not doing something wrong here.

A new MMO game was released a couple of days ago, and it's fairly easy to level up and make progress in it. My friends were really excited about this game and introduced me to it, and I ended up falling in love with it almost immediately.

Initially, we all played together as a group, and it was a lot of fun. However, I got so engrossed in the game that I started playing it on my own as well. I enjoyed the feeling of making progress, leveling up, and exploring the game's world even when my friends weren't around. I didn't think much of it because, to me, it seemed like a natural thing to do when you're enthusiastic about a new game.

Recently, I noticed that my solo gaming sessions had really upset one of my friends. He mentioned that everyone in the group was waiting for each other to be online so that we could all progress together, and he seemed quite disappointed when he realized I had advanced beyond the rest of the group. He told me that it wasn't cool for me to play without them because it left the others behind. He kept repeating the phrase: ""Bro doesn't wanna play with his friends"". His reaction caught me off guard because I didn’t think playing on my own would be a big deal.

Now, I'm left wondering: Why should I have to wait for them to play a game I genuinely enjoy? Shouldn't I be able to play it whenever I want? His disappointment made me question whether I had inadvertently done something wrong. I don't want to start a conflict with him, but now I feel like playing the game with them might become awkward because he seemed to take this very seriously.

He rarely plays any game solo. He often emphasizes how much he and the rest of the group enjoy playing with me, which makes this situation even more confusing, and makes me feel bad. I genuinely enjoy playing with them too, but I also like playing on my own sometimes.

One of the friends in this group only gets on until late night, so, to me, it's really annoying having to wait that long just to play a game.

20,1dvhofo,AITA for calling my sister a crazy bitch and not caring about her feelings? ,"My 6 year old brother Sam was diagnosed with cancer and he’s been having a pretty tough time. I’m genuinely devastated and am so scared. 

Sam is the youngest and a half sibling, and I have two older siblings that I’m 100% related to. My older brother (22) is pretty upset as well but my sister (Laura-25) is very whatever about the whole thing.

You see, we have very different views on our mother’s remarriage. She believes that our parents split up for no reason and that mom must’ve been the problem since dad hasn’t remarried. She also believes mom shouldn’t have had another kid so late in life (my mom was in her mid 40s). Thankfully, she hadn’t said this in front of anyone but me and my older brother but she thinks that Sam getting cancer was a given and a consequence of mom’s stupidity. So she doesn’t see his illness as something sad, but as something natural. 

I think she’s too prideful to show that she’s sad since she was never very kind to Sam and is now making up weird stuff to avoid feeling guilty or something like that. 

My older brother, Laura and I were having dinner with our dad and he asked us how Sam was doing. Laura got annoyed and said “Oh my god, why do you care? He’s mom’s problem not yours, she wouldn’t care if you had cancer and neither would Sam.” My dad was quite taken aback and said that he’s a kid and he’s our brother, so of course he cares. Laura then started ranting about how silly we all are as this is a natural consequence and that we should be glad mom’s being punished. 

I immediately called her a crazy bitch and told her to take her insane ramblings somewhere else in response. She got teary eyed and said that she’s just so tired of everyone worrying about mom and Sam while the rest of us could go through worse and they wouldn’t care. She then stormed out of dad’s house after calling me an ass kisser and an idiot. 

Dad’s concerned by her outburst and told me I shouldn’t have insulted her and we should consider her feelings but I’m so tired of hearing her talk about mom and Sam like that. She may not feel anything but I genuinely feel like my whole world is crashing down. Perhaps I got too worked up and she’s clearly having some kind of a break, but AITA for not showing her any grace and insulting her?

22,1dvhgp7,AITA for moving my neighbor’s dry laundry?,"I (25F) live in an apartment building with 6 units, all of which are occupied by multiple people. We all share a single laundry machine and dryer. Last week while my neighbor’s clothes had 19 minutes left in the dryer, I put my clothes in the washing machine. 

When my 35 minute timer went off, their clothes were still in the dryer but the machine was done. They had been sitting for roughly 15 minutes but I decided to give my neighbor more time (maybe they WFH, were having a nap, etc. whatever). I waited another 45 minutes, but their clothes were still there and I got annoyed because mine had been sitting wet. I wouldn’t have done this if my neighbor didn’t have a hamper, but they did, so I moved their clothes to the hamper so I could dry mine.

Today I noticed their hamper in the laundry room again with a bright pink sticky note that said “that was mad disrespectful, don’t ever touch my clothes again.” I feel bad for making them uncomfortable, but is it not unfair to hog a shared appliance? Was an hour not enough grace?

23,1dvhggr,AITA My dad don’t seem to like me as much after I turned 16,"For the past months my dad has started acting different towards me when im at his place (my parents are divorced)

He doesn't start conversations with me, he doesn't call me, he doesn't message me to ask how I or stuff like that, we don't do stuff together anymore and rarely has a good tone or sounds happy when he talks with me.

It's the complete opposite with my younger sister, they often do stuff, they actually have conversations and they call/message each other often. When I message him, he tends to read my messages without replying, even if it's a question. I also got in to a good school after getting good grades but he didn't seem to care, even if has been my goal for 2 years.


I don't really know why this is happening but it's affecting me a lot and I always have the thought of him being mad at me in the back of my mind.

One thing he has been complaining about is me not helping at home, if I don't set the table or take the dishes away from the table, he gets mad at me. According to him, it happens all the time and he thinks that I dont give a shit. I try to help, but sometimes I forget, but not because of ""I don't give a shit"".

He often compares me to my suster, telling me that she always helps my dad with stuff at home, which she kind of does. I would do more if my dad wouldn't be like he is right now.

Recently, I told him something in a slightly bad tone, and he got really mad. He just yelled ""You don't care about anyone or anything"" and I barely talked with him during that day and the day after.

I don't know what he meant with that really, maybe I'm too dumb to understand?

It has come to a point where I don't want to be at his place anymore with all the negativity. I don't really like to be there in the first place because there isn't anything to do there and I don't have any ""real"" friends to hang out with.

Who is in the wrong here? I've never sat down with my dad to discuss something like this and I don't want to.

24,1dvhbfb,AITA for refusing to make edibles for a party then freaking out when I was uninvited?,"Ok so I (19f) make edibles for myself and the occasional friend who comes to hang out when I just so happen to be in the mood to make them. They are very strong, and very tasty (they just toast like normal cookies with a slightly off smell) because of how I make them so anytime someone wants edibles they usually will pay me to make them- This time tho a big group of my friends are throwing a party and the friend who was giving me a ride asked me to bring some edibles, to supply the WHOLE party! I know I’m NTA for saying no to this because on top of it being a *felony* it’s also like,,, 100ish dollars of product for free and that’s wild. I have other moral issues with it but my point is clear.

Where I think I might be the asshole comes into play with, after I refused the next day I was told that I no longer had a ride to the party which was obvious in reason to me but then when I asked everyone else including someone who I can WALK TO THEIR HOUSE- everyone also magically could no longer give me a ride despite a few days before when they were under the impression I was bringing shit they were literally clamoring over each other to make sure I had a ride.

Funny right?

So I message in the discord calling people out for the fake-ness and blow up saying:

You guys are so fucking fake dude, a few days ago you guys were desperately trying to make sure I had a ride so I could bring shit that I never agreed to bring and now that I have said no y’all are all of a sudden all too busy to stop but and grab me? Honestly fuck off with that shit asking me for free edibles for almost 20 people is way too much and majority of you have to pass my house to get to the party so what happened all of a sudden? Y’all did the same selfish shit back in April and I’m so done with all of it- ✌️ 

—— this is just a copy paste of the text cause I wanted to be transparent, a couple of my friends who are actually my friends and interact with me normally have dmed me and said basically it wasn’t a good move because while ppl shouldn’t have asked me for so much sometimes plans change and they just genuinely couldn’t give me a ride

Idk it all feels fake-

Extra context that isn’t too important but that stands out that I didn’t include, the ppl at the party are 18-20 with one 16 yo that is someone’s kid brother (he isn’t allowed to drink/ smoke they just tag along sometimes) also I have had drama in the past with these people on multiple occasions and I won’t dive into that in full unless asked but it boils down to the same level of selfishness imo- also I left the discord after this.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the feedback, tried to interact a bit cause I enjoy the conversation but I don’t wanna suck my own dick in the comments so overall thanks glad I’m right in my original thought of it’s not me I just have shit friends lmao. 

TLDR: 
After I refused to make edibles for the group, My ride to the party and invite was essentially revoked and I blew up over it before leaving the group chats.

25,1dvgu8y,AITA for booking a holiday without my wife,"Me and my wife (both 24) have been married for 4 years and are blessed with 2 sons. We didn’t get to go on a honeymoon as it was cancelled due to Covid and we made enough to have ends meet but didn’t make enough for holidays abroad for the first 3 years of marriage.

My wife’s never had a job this entire marriage as she stays at home with the kids, we went on our first Holiday abroad last year. It was a kid free holiday and we found that spark we lost momentarily. 

I decided that I had to go on yearly holidays abroad and since it’s super expensive for the both of us I just went ahead and booked it with my friends. 

She said she understood why and didn’t say much. 

Anyways the last 4 of months she’s started making money online. And she’s currently got £10k in savings. To say I’m surprised she’s managed to make so much money just posting content is an understatement.


We don’t plan to take the kids abroad until they’re 5 because flights with a 1 yr old and 3 yr old sounds like a bit much. We do take them around the country in the meantime and they love it just as much.

But my wife is now saying she can’t believe how I’d book a holiday without her, she knows our financial situation back then so I don’t get why she’s mad.

She says I motivated her and that my selfishness is a cause for concern.

Sadly my mum walked in and while in a rush to tidy the kitchen 

side note: she’s contanstly frantically tidying, my family speculate she has OCD. I have a similar feeling (I don’t think ocd) but it’s more related to germs than “tidiness”.

When she sorting the fridge out she accidentally dropped my cake on floor. 
I froze kind of waiting for her reaction, as in that moment it determined mine in a way. I hoped maybe she’d say sorry or something, instead she started shouting about how I’m stupid and careless, and called my other 3 siblings stupid (I have no idea why).

I kind of lost it, and ran to the bathroom to cry (it’s so dumb and childish, I haven’t done that in years lol but it felt good).  While I was there my mum continued shouting from the kitchen, when my two older siblings went to try and explain to her a different perspective, she said it was my fault for causing her to make the mistake.

When pressed harder she YELLED “So is this my fault?” and I felt guilty here because her voice cracked slightly with some emotion.

And then she was shouting her I’m lucky it was her who made the mistake cause anyone else would’ve left the mess.

I know she’ll never apologise and sadly that’s all I wanted so bad. But she’s never said sorry to me my whole 16 years of life.

30,1dvg1wh,AITA for not sweeping the steps?,"Me and my sibling are college students back at home for the summer with our dad. Last night, he asked us individually if one of us would sweep the steps. This was around 8 pm or so, so not dark out yet but late enough that we both assumed he meant for us to do it the next day. This morning at 8 am, he woke up both up loudly asking which one of us was going to sweep the steps last night, in a voice that probably wasn't shouting but wasn't a fun thing to wake up to. We’d agreed last night that I’d do it. I said so and he told me to go do it now. I usually wake up closer to 11, so it took me 10m to get out of bed, during which time he (justifiably) yelled up the stairs at me again.

I go down and sweep the steps. As I'm doing so, I realize that he wanted it done before the streetcleaners come by at 9. When I'm done, I go talk to him. It goes something like this:

Me: next time you ask us to do something and it's already getting dark, can you tell us you want it done tonight so we can avoid this in the future?

D: Can we have this conversation later when you're more awake?

Me: I'd rather have it now.

D: I told your sibling that I wanted it done last night.

There may have been another exchange, but at that point I went back upstairs. I was hoping he would just say he would next time and maybe even say sorry. I got an attempted dismissal and an irrelevant excuse. My sibling told me he never told them when to do it either.

I didn't want to have lunch with my dad (we were celebrating the fourth) and asked my sibling to tell him that. They do. He comes upstairs. Asks me whats up.

M: I'd appreciate it if in the future when I came to you and asked you if things could be done differently after you messed up you didn't just dismiss me completely.

D: In my mind when I ask you to do something it means I want it done soon. (He's asked me to sweep one other time this summer and told me to do it sometime in the next few days. I figured this was the same) I wanted us to talk about it later when we weren't both intemperate. 

I'm forgetting the middle of the conversation, but it cycled back to the steps and his point of view.

M: When you ask me to do something and its getting late could you specify a timeframe so that you don't wake me and sibling up yelling?

D: I expected you to understand that I wanted it done then. When I came downstairs and saw that it hadn't been done, I was irate. I thought about doing it myself, but then decided it was your responsibility. So I came up to wake you up. I thought I was talking loudly, but I didn't mean to yell.

I was pretty mad and can't remember the rest. At the end he asked if I would come down for lunch.

I'm not usually one to react much so I don't feel as if I'm overreacting. 

From my perspective my dad was unclear then was rude when we didn't meet his expectations that we didn't know. When I asked if things could be done differently in the future he was dismissive and unapologetic. 

AITA? Am I overreacting?

",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-04,"AITA for not sweeping the steps? Me and my sibling are college students back at home for the summer with our dad. Last night, he asked us individually if one of us would sweep the steps. This was around 8 pm or so, so not dark out yet but late enough that we both assumed he meant for us to do it the next day. This morning at 8 am, he woke up both up loudly asking which one of us was going to sweep the steps last night, in a voice that probably wasn't shouting but wasn't a fun thing to wake up to. We’d agreed last night that I’d do it. I said so and he told me to go do it now. I usually wake up closer to 11, so it took me 10m to get out of bed, during which time he (justifiably) yelled up the stairs at me again.

I go down and sweep the steps. As I'm doing so, I realize that he wanted it done before the streetcleaners come by at 9. When I'm done, I go talk to him. It goes something like this:

Me: next time you ask us to do something and it's already getting dark, can you tell us you want it done tonight so we can avoid this in the future?

D: Can we have this conversation later when you're more awake?

Me: I'd rather have it now.

D: I told your sibling that I wanted it done last night.

There may have been another exchange, but at that point I went back upstairs. I was hoping he would just say he would next time and maybe even say sorry. I got an attempted dismissal and an irrelevant excuse. My sibling told me he never told them when to do it either.

I didn't want to have lunch with my dad (we were celebrating the fourth) and asked my sibling to tell him that. They do. He comes upstairs. Asks me whats up.

M: I'd appreciate it if in the future when I came to you and asked you if things could be done differently after you messed up you didn't just dismiss me completely.

D: In my mind when I ask you to do something it means I want it done soon. (He's asked me to sweep one other time this summer and told me to do it sometime in the next few days. I figured this was the same) I wanted us to talk about it later when we weren't both intemperate.

I can't begin to describe the mental & emotional abuse I went through growing up from members of family, including my own elder brother. 

After decades of drama, our family is now split up, my brother and I live separately from our family, and my father already made a prior choice to move in with my step-mother and half-brother which is fine. I still visit, but never considered that place home. 

Time went by, we had issues, and it always revolves around my brother stirring up issues. We've been caught in a drama triangle for ages: me & my father & him. He goes from playing the victim (victim of my father's poor life choices which i agree with) to prosecutor to pretending to be my ""rescuer"". During all this time, I am always the one to blame, the one asked to resolve the problem, the one weighted down by all these responsibilities, however, no matter what I do, no matter which side I take, no matter how much financial aid I provided, emotional support for him, it's never enough.   
  
My father will shame me for not taking his side, so will my step-mother. My brother will blame me for not doing enough for him. Recently, I went through lots of stress because of an issue he had with father that escalated fast. It took a toll on me. I confronted him and he had an excuse as usual and i ended up the one to blame that's when i know i am dealing with a narcissist.  
  
Fast forward a couple of months, I decided to never take part in any drama. I stayed away from family occasions like holidays etc to not see him, however, my family forgave him, as they always do. Now they expect me to do the same. The dude never apologies, he will curse at you, take your money THEN you're expected to forgive him just because his your brother. I decided to stand my ground this time. Of course, now I am the villain for being cold-hearted, and family keeps making excuses to talk to him so I decided let them down, gently, and by that I mean, I am not going to visit anymore, it's been over 6 months since I did and I don't see myself going anytime soon. I have no problem having my father visit and talk things with him, but the old man is the type who avoids conflicts by running away and pretending they don't exist OR discussing it decades after so there's that.

I call him to get the details, like what hospital, how long is this going to take, is the wife there too? He doesn't say much & gets me off the phone pretty fast then calls me a few minutes later pissed that I seemed upset. I ask what hospital because previously they have always went to one about 45 minutes away. Is the wife there? Are you driving them or did they drive separately?  He is appalled that I want to know this info it seems & says why can't you just trust me. I admit at this point I was getting pissed. Why can't you just tell me, why is me wanting to know now a huge deal? He ends up hanging up on me when I try to explain why I'd like to know more info.

33,1dvfjru,AITA for lying about a piece of pottery?,"Backstory: My (19F) and my mom (53F) have a rocky relationship. My older sister has severe mental health issues and so it always made my mom a little tougher on me so I didn't act like my sister. My mom is especially sensitive right now as she recently disowned my sister. Through the years, this has caused my mom to often blow up at me over small things and so I (wrongly) developed the habit of lying to avoid some of the blow ups. It especially doesn't help that my mom is very conservative so she overreacts about things regarding sex, drugs, profanity, etc.

My LDR boyfriend (19M) came down to visit and we went to paint pottery together. He has a crass sense of humor (which I love) and painted a mushroom house as a drug dealer house. He left the pottery piece for me as he couldn't take it back with him, but I already knew my mom would absolutely hate it so I had a plan to pick it up and just throw it out. Unfortunately my mom came to pick up the pottery with me so I had to hide it in my bag and lie that he took it with him.

My mom went snooping through my bedroom (I live with my parents) and found it. Since then she's been distraught over how I don't value her or respect her more than a crass mushroom house and I don't prioritize her and am willing to wreck our entire relationship for a dumb lie. I tried explaining it's not about respect, I just get very scared and she got more mad and said then I am just incredibly selfish and put my feelings first.

I believe our relationship hit the breaking point and while I have apologized, I still am unclear if I should have just told her straight up. She said I could have said my boyfriend didn't want her to see his piece and she would have accepted that excuse, but that is a lie as she would have snooped to find it.

We are planning to move to my husband's home town and live with his elderly parents for up to a year while looking for a house in the general area. Lots of pros to this plan. I'm 7 months pregnant (yes, planned) and this is speeding up our need for a larger home.

I am vastly more upset about this situation than my husband is. I strongly dislike where he is from, but it is practical to move there due to housing being so much more affordable. He also strongly dislikes where I'm from, though he's only been there twice. Personally I would like to retire there eventually because his home area is very hot and I have an illness that makes it difficult for me to be in the heat for extended periods of time, whereas I'm from a much cooler climate.

  
Background aside.... recently we were visiting husbands parents. His mom was showing us where we could set up in their house (it's a large house in the suburbs, plenty of space). MIL is SO excited for us to move back and live with them, and husband and MIL were both talking about the arrangement as if it could extend longer than a year if it works well. 

I was doing my best not to cry. I'm hormonal, and I don't want to move away from the family and friends I have where we currently live. I love his parents, but I hate the idea of living with them and being in their house makes me feel suffocated. So as she talked about it, I wasn't saying much because if I did I would have cried.

MIL stopped talking and says, ""I guess (my name) isn't looking forward to it.""

I tried to play it off but she was sad and packed away some baby items. I went back downstairs because I had started crying and didn't want to make a big deal. My husband followed me and told me off for making his mom feel bad and that he didn't appreciate it. 

This has become a point of contention for husband and I. I talked it out with MIL and we're fine.

She is worse than before, because now the boyfriend is doing all of those things for her and enabling her.

I had invited everyone to come, as I had the opportunity to work on some of the costumes for the show that night.  We were sat at a big table by the stage.  The seating for the theater is all tables and chairs, and there are three levels of floor space for the tables that descend as you get closer to the stage.  I was sitting at the back of our table, so my head was level with the table on the level above us.  The food is served buffet style, and the play starts after dessert has begun.

As we were starting to eat our food, an alarm started to go off next to my ear.  The couple that was sitting at the table above me was away getting their food.  I waited for about two minutes, but it was LOUD, and positioned so that it was blaring at me.  I saw that the phone was an iPhone, and so I tapped the little snooze button so that the alarm would stop, but I (and everyone around us) wouldn’t have to keep hearing the alarm.  I planned on telling the couple what happened as soon as they returned with their food, as I assumed it was most likely a medication reminder.

When I did this, my mom, who was at the other end of the table, was astonished and scolded me harshly for touching someone else’s possession.  I tried to say that I only snoozed it, and that it had been blaring in my ear, but she told me that it’s never acceptable to handle something that I know belongs to someone else.  She said, “what if that alarm was for an important medication?”  I replied, “I only snoozed it, and I am going to let them know as soon as they return.”  She continued to scold me in front of my friends and future SIL for “my behavior”. 

When the people returned, I told them what I had done, politely apologizing for snoozing the alarm, and they thanked me and apologized as well for leaving the phone on the table.  They didn’t seem upset at all that I touched the phone. 

This incident has come up a few times in conversation since.  My mom will not back down or apologize to me for scolding me and embarrassing me in front of my friends and family.

39,1dvdh8p,"AITA for not being ""gentle"" enough when reminding flatmates of tasks they're neglecting?","I (29F) am sharing a flat with two female flatmates. Janet (26F) moved in around seven months ago and Susan (26F) three months ago.

I informed them both before they moved in that there is a weekly cleaning schedule with assigned tasks and that everyone is responsible for cleaning up after themselves. There are also household items like toilet paper that we share and therefore have to buy in rotation. They both agreed to this enthusiastically. I also told them that if they have any suggestions or any complaints, I'm always open to it.

When Janet moved in there were some minor things to discuss, but she was like me generally ready to listen and compromise. My old flatmate was also still living here so things kind of worked well. The issues started when Susan moved in.

It started with the kitchen being left messy, the bathroom and kitchen not being cleaned properly until I did it, fruit flies forming because someone was keeping fruits in their room, and things like toilet paper going empty and not being bought on time, forcing me to either get it myself or wait for days until someone finally did. I usually try to ignore minor things like a stain here and there or if someone forgets to buy something once. I would clean or do it myself, but if there was a bigger mess repeating itself I would approach them.

Sometimes I would do it in person, but since I never knew who it really was and we all have different schedules, I would write in the group chat. Some things would get better but some things kept repeating themselves.

I would sometimes be gone for the weekend or longer and would come back to no toilet paper, no dishwasher tabs, no paper towels, no cleaning stuff. The walls would get moldy while I was gone and no one would clean it, the vacuum bag would be so full of dust it didn't even suck anymore, old boxes would lay around that no one thought of throwing out. 

At this point I was getting very frustrated. The last time I was gone, I came back to a half cleaned shower and half cleaned kitchen, with sauce stains on the cupboards. I cleaned and then wrote them a message, asking them to please pay a bit more attention to these things and that they could also mention it if something else was being neglected.

Susan reply was: ""I don't know why you keep writing messages instead of telling these things in person when we live in the same house"", and how I should be more gentle when I write these messages instead of attacking them. I replied that I don't have the time to approach them individually since I don't know who is at fault and that honestly I wish I didn't have to do it at all. I've already done it so often and in person as well with little results. Her reply was that I'm not perfect either and that I sound very arrogant and aggressive, that we can talk in person and set rules that apply to everyone not just them.

41,1dvcz4f,AITAH for telling my boyfriend not to litter right after I cleaned?,"Me (28f) and boyfriend (28m) have lived together for a year now in our apartment. I study full time from home and my boyfriend renovates houses. Boyfriend has been stressed from work lately, so I have taken on the responsibility of cooking, cleaning and keeping our home tidy so he can focus on work. Usually we split the household chores pretty equally. 

I spent the day tidying up and cleaning the apartment today. We have a bit of a tight schedule today as we decided to go to the gym and then immediately pick up some stuff we bought on marketplace after. 

Boyfriend comes home and quickly changes into workout clothes, throwing his clothes and shoes in the kitchen and then eats a brownie that I made yesterday without a plate, getting crumbs all over the floor. He then rushes to wait in the car. I won’t lie, I got a little irked by the mess he made in a matter of 30 seconds of getting home, but decided not to say anything as we were in a hurry. We drive to the gym and my boyfriend asks if something is wrong as I’m a little quiet on the way. I calmly tell him that it’s okay and I know we were in a hurry, but could he please be sure to clean up his clothes and cookie crumbs from the floor once we get home, as usual had just cleaned the place. He gets defensive and says he had a long day and can I please not nitpick at him over the smallest things. I tell him once again that it’s okay, but will he please just pick it up once we get home. He gets mad and says that if he can’t litter in his own home the moment I have cleaned it, then he doesn’t want to come home at all. He says I need to stop managing him after a long day of work, and that picking up crumbs is not on his to do list. I blew up at him and said that I feel like he is completely disregarding the work I do to make his day easier and he countered that if the roles were reversed he wouldn’t tell me anything in the first place and that I leave my shit everywhere already. 

He drove off and I’m sitting at home wondering how it escalated so much. Should I not have said anything? Am I the asshole?

45,1dvce6m,AITA for finally expressing frustration towards my best friend after consoling her due to her toxic relationship for over 3 years? ,"
I've been close friends with my best friend for about five years. She's been dating a guy I've known since middle/high school, so naturally, we became friends too. We bonded over their early relationship issues while they lived with his family. At the time, I was in another relationship dealing with substance abuse issues. We supported each other through our respective challenges.

When my relationship ended, she was my rock during my hardships. Eventually, I found a new relationship while hers continued to struggle, particularly due to her boyfriend's ongoing drinking problems, leading to frequent arguments and even drunk driving incidents. Despite my advice, she remained in the relationship, contributing financially and caring for his little sister.

Recently, she called me in tears, saying they broke up and she planned to move back home. I offered my full support. However, days passed, and she didn't leave her current location. Her boyfriend then revealed she'd been texting other men, even inappropriately. I felt betrayed because she hadn't been honest with me, and defending her not knowing this made me feel like a bad person to her boyfriend but he knows that I had no idea. 

Frustrated with her actions and busy with my own responsibilities, I distanced myself. Despite feeling annoyed by her ongoing problems, I still tried to maintain contact. However, she sensed my distance and asked if I hated her. I explained my frustration honestly but politely. Since then, she hasn't responded, and it's been weeks since we last spoke.

I reached out to her boyfriend for clarity, and he expressed disappointment in her lack of effort to change. He's considering ending the relationship for good. I question whether I've been too harsh, but I can't keep investing in someone who won't help themselves.

46,1dvcbxn,"AITA for Telling My Mom to Stop Talking So Loud? She Said She ""Never Wants to Speak to Me Again"" and We Haven't Spoken Since.","I'm 22 and live with my parents after graduating college in May. I moved back in to save money while starting my new job. My relationship with my mom has always been challenging. She's been strict, distrusting, and emotionally volatile. I'm constantly trying to please her, and she's never one to apologize or take accountability.

Last night, we went out for my parents' wedding anniversary. Everything was fine until my mom started loudly shit talking on a man in designer clothing on a nearby yacht. I mentioned that I knew him because he often visited the restaurant where I worked and was very generous with tips. Embarrassed, I quietly asked her to tone it down. She got defensive, called me names, and said I ruined her anniversary. She started crying, said she never wants to speak to me again, and stormed off, taking the car keys and the card we were using to pay. My dad had to go after her to get the keys and card. She then said she'd take the train home because he didn't ""defend her.""

My dad is calm and collected, which often makes her angrier. After my mom left, we all cried at the table. I expressed my love and appreciation for my dad, who was touched as nobody had ever told him that before. My mom stayed at my aunt's house and hasn't come home yet. She canceled a trip we had planned to visit my sister because she didn't want to be alone with me. We haven't spoken since.

A similar event happened with my sister a month ago. My mom loudly criticized an employee at a store where my sister works (but at a different location). My sister, who just got promoted, asked her to keep it down. My mom stormed out and didn't talk to her for days. The employee reported my sister to headquarters for ""acting suspicious"" because she was crying. My mom didn't apologize.

When we got home from dinner, my dad and I went for a walk, and I ended up throwing up from the stress. I haven't stopped crying since. My dad suggested family therapy. I've been in therapy for years for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and grief. I've recommended therapy to my mom many times, especially after a tragic loss, but she says she doesn't need it.

I told my dad it sucks being in this situation. I'm the one doing the work in therapy to try to communicate better and have better relationships. As a 22-year-old, I should be the immature one, but my mom, in her 50s, is running away and verbally abusing everyone. I feel like the asshole, but I don't know if it's the years of gaslighting from her speaking. I don't know how to proceed, especially since I'm living under my parents' roof until I can save enough to pay off my student loans and rent an apartment.

Anyways, because of ""culture"" I've been told I'm not allowed to travel on my own or do anything, eg i cant stay out beyond 9pm. my plan was to travel to this city by myself and stay overnight in a hotel. This got blocked immediately, despite me funding this myself. because I didn't want to disappoint my parents I said fine, and they offered to take me, which I was grateful for.

 Coming to the day, they can't take me due to factors out of their control (adding to my guilt). i was upset because I had a plan that would have worked out if they just trusted me. So i start telling my mum saying I knew this was going to happen and I should have done as I planned. my mum is quite hot headed and she escalated it. she started calling me a lesbian and saying names about my friend. she was saying she preferred my old abusive friend because it brought less trouble and i deserved that treatment. really the only difference was that i just spoke to my mum less then.

anyways I get more upset because I just felt voiceless. she started saying I'm better off alone and she wants me gone. I started saying to her I could have moved out for uni but you all stopped me because of ""culture"", she then says, I apparently have too much of an ego (gods gift) and im acting white. She also thinks im naive which i dont think is true. I mostly have dealt with my own conflicts myself, because my parents aren't really emotionally there (as said by social services - should probably add that my mum is an untreated schizophrenic, no support in 10 years). she also kept saying she preferred me when i was younger and was obedient. I used to be very easy going and i still think i am, but whats different is now i feel more confident to say how i feel.

To be fair i think i wasnt as nice either, like i said to her shes horrible and i dont like her, but i was mostly saying you never listen to me. I also started yelling at her about the fact she always puts my siblings first but when i ask for something im spoiled. she said im an adult so I don't need attention. 

I guess why I feel so bad is because I know you shouldn't yell at your parents but I've done it so much recently over the fact they refuse to let me make my own decisions and override me. i am still financially dependent on them for food and housing and i do realise they do a lot for me, but am i really asking too much? my wider family supports them which is upsetting because they said if my parents couldn't be there for me they would and they aren't.
 
Anyways, I jusy want to know AITA and asking for too much by wanting a bit of freedom. I do have a lot of freedom now, like I have a job and I am allowed to leave the house, but I just want to know was it unreasonable to blow up at my mum.

I’m on summer break and decided to move back into my parents home for the summer to help them out with chores and taking care of my brother with special needs. I’m also trying to find a better job by preparing for engineering interviews for the fall. 

My family is a financial pickle. We live in a tiny home with 8 people in it. One of the family member have special needs and always need watching over. I took over a lot of the responsibility of watching over him as well as doing chores around the house. But this is starting to feel futile. 

I haven’t been able to focus on studying up and preparing for interviews because I’ve been stressed about taking care of the home. So ive been thinking about moving out early. I already have a separate place to stay, i just feel guilty if I leave. Originally I wanted to move mid August but the situation has gotten so stressful i wanna move out a month and a half early.

I feel like I would be a deadbeat son if i  leave early. I have other siblings who can watch over my brother with special needs but lowkey they are ass at it. 

I cant even sleep at night cause of how miserable I feel here.  Im starting to get lazy, skipping my workouts and overall I just feel depressed. All I do is chores and take care of my brother and I wanna do much more than that before the fall.

All I wanna do is study and work hard so I can help my family live in a better home. So would I be the asshole if I leave?

I’m going to have a conversation with my family but I just wanna hear different perspective and ideas beforehand.

50,1dvbmoq,AITA for refusing to let my sister’s dogs come to our barbecue?,"I (33F) am hosting a barbecue for my and my husband’s families. It’s our first summer living in this house, we have a large fenced in backyard and have been looking forward to being able to host things like this. We invited both our families and spent a lot of time and money into planning, getting food, etc. 

My sister (35F) texted me this morning saying how excited her babies were to see our new yard and see the family. By her “babies” she means her 4 dogs. All of them are medium to large, all of them jump on people, all of them will steal food, and she has a habit of never cleaning up their poop. It would be bad enough that her dogs are poorly trained, but I use mobility aids and her dogs could very easily knock me down. I purposely don’t go to her house for that reason. 

I informed her that the dogs weren’t welcomed, citting mostly they’re a fall risk for me (despite there being a multitude of reasons I don’t want them here). She called me an asshole, said I shouldn’t have called it a “family barbecue” if all of her family wasn’t invited too, that I should have told her from the get go that her dogs weren’t welcomed (they were never allowed at our previous apartment either, which she knew so I didn’t think to say they couldn’t come to our new house), that I shouldn’t allow my nieces and nephews over because they also could knock me down as could our son (he’s 7), and went off on me.

Now my parents are calling me trying to get me to compromise and allow her to bring the dogs because “the yard is big enough the dogs shouldn’t bother you” and that they’ll help manage them. Between both our families, there will be over 20 people there, I don’t want to add the chaos of her dogs. They think I’m being harsh and that I should look at it from my sisters point of view that almost all the siblings from both my husband and my side have kids and the dogs are like her kids. AITA for still refusing to let her dogs come?

ETA Update: The barbecue was wonderful. We’re headed out to see our municipal fireworks now.

Sister did come to the barbecue, she did not bring her dogs. She opted instead to throw passive aggressive comments around the entire time that she was here. Upon coming to the deck and seeing the backyard, it was immediately “oh the babies would have loved being able to play back here.” When I mentioned to my husband how sweet it was to see our kid playing with all his cousins in the yard, she mumbled “not all the cousins.” I didn’t let her comments get the reaction out of me that she wanted. 

She stayed for less than an hour because she couldn’t leave the dogs home alone for long and couldn’t find a dog sitter last minute. I did tell her I was sorry she couldn’t stay and to make herself a plate to go. My husband caught her trying to take an entire rack of ribs, multiple steaks, and way too much meat for one person. When he stopped her, she got loud saying “you guys said my babies couldn’t come so the least you could do is feed them.” He shut that down quickly stating we didn’t buy and make all this food for dogs. She stormed out after that.

My parents didn’t apologize but they also didn’t defend her behavior or say that I should have just given in. They just pretended like nothing happened and they didn’t try to pressure me to give in earlier. So aside from about 40 minutes, it was great. I did tell my brother about the texts and everything from earlier and he was fully supportive (he hates her dogs).

53,1dvamo5,AITA for the fights with my mother?,"AITA, I am F18 and still in high school about to start my senior year so I still live with my parents, I got a job in town working as a CNA at a nursing home. My mom has always been the hardest on me because I’m the oldest, I understand that but recently it’s been out of control. She blames me for not being able to go on a trip this summer because I was working so much so I cleared the next month because nothing was available and I met the requirements I needed, but then she gets mad that I’m not talking to her about working more. Oh and she never told me before that she wanted to go on this trip or when she just got mad one day. She wants me to talk to her about work, and “everything”? But she won’t tell me what she means and I can’t have a conversation with her without it just being her lecturing me pretty much, and that’s what all out conversations are no matter what they are about! So I stopped talking to her as much and that makes her mad, instead I’ll talk to my dad because it’s easier and honestly less scary. Every time I try to talk to her it seems like we fight and nothing goes anywhere. Even with things around the house, it’s always my fault something isn’t cleaned or done right, but she is never like that with my siblings and for context they are only 2 and 4 years younger than me so they are teens as well. It doesn’t matter if it’s something I could control or if I moved something or not, I always have to find it, fix it, clean it whatever the case. I think she resents me because I ruined her life plans by being born. She doesn’t say that but it feels like it because it’s only be and it’s always been like this just gotten worse recently. She said that she’s going to cut me out of her life, pull me out of school and take things like my phone and going out away from me if I don’t change. All I do is work and see my boyfriend or I’m at home. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong, I do good in school I stay out of trouble for the most part. So am I the asshole for not talking to her about whatever it is she thinks needs to be discussed or is she just being to harsh on me?

56,1dv9mfn,AITA for not giving my bridesmaid dress away ,"Backstory: my cousin “Mary” (who I was never close to) got engaged and asked her bridal party a month or 2 in. I wasn’t asked, didn’t care as we’re not close. My other cousin “Lisa” (who has cancer) was the matron of honor - no surprise here; they were always close. Marys sister in law to be is the maid of honor. I was also never close to Lisa either and actually had not spoke to her for almost 6 years but when she got sick, I reached out-no motive beyond wanting her to know I was thinking of her. (*Edit to clarify: Lisa is older than Mary. I am younger than both. Lisa and Mary always left me out growing up. I did not attend Lisa’s wedding years ago due to family drama and as a result did not speak to her for about 5/6 years. When I heard Lisa was sick, I reached out. We began talking and at this point speak almost every day. Both of us seem to have put the past behind us. Mary gets engaged late summer/early fall 2023. I congratulated her but also didn’t think I’d be invited to the wedding given we don’t talk.*)

Fast forward 2 more months, I got a random call from Mary asking if I wanted to be a bridesmaid. I was surprised but agreed, figuring I’d get to spend time with Lisa and maybe create an adult cousin relationship with them both. Two weeks later, Mary sends a text to Lisa kicking her out due to her “having a lot going on due to having cancer and being unable to do wedding stuff”. I also drop out because I felt used and like a replacement. When dropping out, I offered to give the dress (which I bought) to my replacement. I never heard anything so I donated the dress. (*Edit to add: it had to be more than 2 weeks looking back. Maybe it was more like a month and a half? Nevertheless, when I got the invite for the bridal shower, I checked the wedding website and saw that there was no bridesmaid added in my place. A few weeks after that, I went to donate the dress. All in all I waited almost 2.5 months before donating the dress. The bride had given a deadline to order the dresses in order to have the same batch of dye for all dresses, so if she was going to replace me, I figured she would have done so sooner than later*). 

This week, I get a text from the sister in law asking for the dress (not offering to pay for the dress, just asking me to send it to her house and she would pay for shipping) I said I donated it and I’m accused of conspiring with Lisa when giving my response.

At the time, my brother was still in college and commuting in a truck that was horrible on gas mileage, had nearly 300k miles, no AC and was about to blow up (transmission barely works, it overheats a lot and has a very noticeable tick from a stuck lifter).

The car sat in his backyard for months, never even got driven while he continued to drive his nearly dead truck.

61,1dv8ogw,AITA for removing someone else's clothes from a public washing machine?,"For some context, I am a 16 year old girl, living in an apartment complex, where there are public washing machines every other building. We usually use the washing machines in the building next to us, since that's where the closest ones are.

Today is Thursday. I go down with my mother to wash our laundry. One washing machine is done, with clothes still in, while the other two are empty. Since one of them is broken, residents usually only use the other two washing machines. We load our clothes into the vacant machine, and turn it on. At this point, it's been at **least** 5 minutes, and the other machine is sitting there, done, with clothes still in, and the owner not there.

We wait for them to come get their clothes. My mom scrolls on her phone, and I walk around the room. After a while, they're still not here. We agree that it's best if we put their finished laundry into *their* laundry bag, which they left on top of the machine. Keep in mind, this is a public space. Over the last, like, 10 years, I've seen my laundry removed and set aside for me countless times, and have also done it without any uproar. Since there's water on the ground (probably from the leaking machinery), I drag my basket over, and put their bag on top of my clothes. Then, I start removing their clothes from the machine.

However, while we're in the midst of removing the clothes, the door opens, and guess who it is. The owner's finally here! She looks at me, as i'm removing her clothes, and she's shocked (potentially flabbergasted). The first thing she says is: ""What the f\*\*\*"", while she pulls out her phone to snap photos of me. She tells us to step back, and we do. Then, she states that she's going to report us to the condo owner. My mother begins to speak, reminding her that it's a public space, and that if residents don't return in a timely manner for their clothes, other residents are free to remove them, and set them aside. She says that she's supposedly ""1 minute late"" and that she had an alarm set. This is ***wonderful*** news, considering how we've been down here the entire time when it's been done.

She makes it public that she feels like we're ""hostile"" and ""aggressive"", as my mother is telling her about public washing room regulations. I'm just standing there. We move our clothes away, and tell her she can touch our clothes if she wants. The women then begins to reload the SAME clothes that she just washed, BACK INTO THE SAME MACHINE. Is this because she thought my hands were contaminated? We may never know. My mother records the woman, and she retorts with a quick ""yep, yep you can record me."" After around 10 seconds, she then yells at my mother to stop recording her. Then, after a little bit more of bickering, the woman leaves. My mother and I just look at each other, and bring our basket to the next building over to wash the rest of our clothes.

Anyways, yeah, I don't know how to feel about this. 😬

Clarification: The five minutes was the amount of time for us to unload our clothes and turn the machine on; we gave them an additional period of time after those 5 minutes (Phone scrolling and waiting)!

Since one of them is broken, residents usually only use the other two washing machines. We load our clothes into the vacant machine, and turn it on. At this point, it's been at **least** 5 minutes, and the other machine is sitting there, done, with clothes still in, and the owner not there.

We wait for them to come get their clothes. My mom scrolls on her phone, and I walk around the room. After a while, they're still not here. We agree that it's best if we put their finished laundry into *their* laundry bag, which they left on top of the machine. Keep in mind, this is a public space. Over the last, like, 10 years, I've seen my laundry removed and set aside for me countless times, and have also done it without any uproar. Since there's water on the ground (probably from the leaking machinery), I drag my basket over, and put their bag on top of my clothes. Then, I start removing their clothes from the machine.

However, while we're in the midst of removing the clothes, the door opens, and guess who it is. The owner's finally here! She looks at me, as i'm removing her clothes, and she's shocked (potentially flabbergasted). The first thing she says is: ""What the f\*\*\*"", while she pulls out her phone to snap photos of me. She tells us to step back, and we do. Then, she states that she's going to report us to the condo owner. My mother begins to speak, reminding her that it's a public space, and that if residents don't return in a timely manner for their clothes, other residents are free to remove them, and set them aside. She says that she's supposedly ""1 minute late"" and that she had an alarm set. This is ***wonderful*** news, considering how we've been down here the entire time when it's been done.

She makes it public that she feels like we're ""hostile"" and ""aggressive"", as my mother is telling her about public washing room regulations. I'm just standing there. We move our clothes away, and tell her she can touch our clothes if she wants. The women then begins to reload the SAME clothes that she just washed, BACK INTO THE SAME MACHINE. Is this because she thought my hands were contaminated? We may never know. My mother records the woman, and she retorts with a quick ""yep, yep you can record me."" After around 10 seconds, she then yells at my mother to stop recording her. Then, after a little bit more of bickering, the woman leaves. My mother and I just look at each other, and bring our basket to the next building over to wash the rest of our clothes.

Anyways, yeah, I don't know how to feel about this. 😬

Clarification: The five minutes was the amount of time for us to unload our clothes and turn the machine on; we gave them an additional period of time after those 5 minutes (Phone scrolling and waiting)! ",0.0,0.04815223440527916,0,1
62,1dv8dnk,AITA for not meeting my biological fathers family when he asked me to.,"I'm (f17) and my biological father found me on Facebook and tried to add me as a friend. I haven't seen him since I was 3 and tbh from what I've heard about him I don't want to. I messaged him telling him I wanted nothing to do with him and that he needs to stop looking for me. He responded thinking my mom made the account to trick him and I tell him that it was in fact his daughter. He tried to tell me that my mom has been lying to me and that he would take care for me. I don't believe either my mom or my biological father but he was saying that he didn't expect me to want to meet him but he did want me to meet my grandmother and my aunt. My mother told me that my grandmother would tell my bio father where I was when I was younger and that's why I don't go to visit her and so I'm kinda hesitant to meet her especially since I don't live too far from my bio father anyways. He said that she would love to see me again. I told him I didn't want to and that I was being rude for not meeting her at least when I turn 18 in a couple of months.

I do want to meet my grandmother but if that risks having my bio father show up I don't want to. I also have extreme anxiety around family members even if I have met them before and see them on a daily basis. I also have had panic attacks because I thought I saw my bio father while I was out somewhere. I kept telling him this but he just said that I was lying and that I was being petty cause I was being taken care of my brother's biological father who adopted me when my father lost his parental rights. He also tried to say that I couldn't have been that traumatized by him cause when I was younger I loved being around him and I was a ""daddies girl"". 

I forgot to mention that not only does he want me to meet my grandmother and aunt he also wants me to meet my younger siblings who I knew existed but I didn't know they were 8 and younger and there are three of them. Also here's the details that I forgot to mention. He kidnapped my brother and I more than once he took my brother and I and would give us to our mom's mother and they both wouldn't let our mom know where we were. He got in a fight with the lady he was married to while he was dating my mom and she shot at him while I was in the room and I almost got hit. He called CPS on my mom and took custody of us for a little bit and had my mom on child support. I also remember him taking my brother and I for a while, while my mom was in jail for not paying parking tickets. My brother got really sick cause of the neglect we were put through.

63,1dv8d5k,WIBTA for not giving a “friend” rides to and from college anymore? ,"So I met my “friend” (let’s call him Jack) in my math class. We hung out a lot and did almost everything together as we’re doing the same major. 

He doesn’t have a car so he commuted to school from his house, he told me it took him 2 and a half hours to get to school and another 2 1/2 hours back. He asked me for rides and I said sure, I went about 40-60 minutes out of my day almost everyday to pick up and drop him off. He never offered gas money and made a mess almost every time because he insisted on getting fast food. It bothered me somewhat but I tried my hardest to not let it get to me. All was well. 

Now when the semester ended I noticed that he started ghosting me a LOT. He would never text or call me anymore, whenever I reach out to him he would respond with like “that’s crazy” or “True”. I tried asking if he wanted to hang out and he would always decline. I haven’t texted or called him in over 3 weeks now, he doesn’t seem to care at all.

He said I was being too submissive and agreeable for just trying to buy these girls drinks when in my head it just didn’t seem like a big deal to me.

He said I was being too submissive and agreeable for just trying to buy these girls drinks when in my head it just didn’t seem like a big deal to me. I do recognize that buying drinks who aren’t of age is an extremely irresponsible but what put me off was that didn’t seem like the main problem in his eyes and why he got angry- the only consequence he seemed to talk about was them simply not serving me the drinks.",1.0,0.30724138021469116,0,0

71,1dv6bzt,AITA for telling the teacher someone I knew copied their work from online based on the files?,"So I am a 16y and the person who I know (15-16y) is in my class for game development in school. Recently our unit had ended and we did the typical thing, submitted our games, and the teacher posted everyone's games on our classroom post. I go through some of the games and I notice that one of the games has files that are branded for ""github"" which is a popular site us develpers use to find material all that. When I play the game it's this really well made 3D car racing game. Which combined with the fact that the branded files already looked suspicious I dubbed the game utterly stolen from github. I put it in the classwork. (Which was where we had to review the games others had made) and as I was writing it the teacher came and saw the accusation. I explained to them that it was suspicious but I had no proof that the game was 100% copied. I thought nothing of it until later on I hear the person talking about it to someone during lunch. (we're in the same friend group). Apparently they worked really hard on a game but it had deleted itself and since this person already had 2 other assessment tasks to do, they grabbed a game from github, apparently they did change some things, and called it a day. The teacher allowed them a extra day extension but it would be very hard for them since they had other things they need to do. AITA?

Edit:  
I'd like to add that despite my choice to tell the teacher, during the time originally, I believed that I'd be willing to take the backlash because anyone would agree that stealing work that isn't yours is wrong, though, is the choice of AITA changed due to the external reasons that the game was stolen? So far I'd agree that ESH despite my overwhelming regret, as I only learned of the reason of the stealing until after the telling of someone, and it's objectively wrong to steal material and pass it off as your own.

72,1dv65nn,AITA for not helping my friend with her project,"Hello all, hope you are well! I used to be friends with a F early 30s, I am M27, but due to some online drama we stopped being friends, also important to the story, i live in Brazil she lives in LA.



Out of nowhere, she messaged me a few months back, apologizing for her behavior. She said she missed me because I was one of her closest friends and always helped her. She admitted she acted childishly and wanted me back in her life. Honestly, I missed her too but had doubts and suspected she needed something from me, But I believe in second chances, so I told her I’d give it another shot. I also told some of her old viewers, who are my friends, that she messaged me again, and we all agreed she probably wanted something.



For the first couple of weeks, everything was fine. We played some games, caught up on life, and she told me she was now working at a big game dev company whose name means a heavy snowstorm. Then, she told me she was working on a project to make her own game. Though I work as a video editor, I have a diploma in game design. She wanted me to work on her game with her. I politely declined, explaining I had no time because I work 9am-7pm on weekdays and spend weekends at my fiancé’s house. Also, I just didn’t want to. She kept pressing, saying she had an investor, but I kept declining.



One day, she asked if I could edit a video for her to post on social media about the game, just a 15-second clip. I asked if it was really ""editing"" or creating something from scratch. She said it was from scratch. I said if she was willing to pay me, I could do it because making something from scratch takes hours, no matter how short the clip. She said the investor’s money was only for development and she was already paying a programmer and a 3D artist. She argued that if I was her friend, I’d do it for free. I told her if she was my friend, she’d value my free time and pay me for my work because the last thing I want to do after spending a whole day editing videos is edit more videos.She got angry and stopped replying to me



The next week, she sent me a $50 credit to the heavy snowstorm launcher store. I asked her what it was for, and she said it was an apology and a gift for a friend. I redeemed the code, and she asked, ""so now will you edit my video?"" I said no and that if this was the reason for the gift, I wouldn’t have redeemed the code. She apologized but kept pressing all week, and I kept saying no. One day, we had the following message exchange:

Her: Good morning, did you edit my video?

Me: Good morning! I’m doing alright. How are you?

Her: I’m fine. Did you edit my video?

Me: That’s great! How did you sleep?

Her: Why are you being an ahole?

Me: How am I being an ahole?

73,1dv5dh3,AITA for refusing to save food that I buy for my younger sister?,"I'm (17m) the second youngest in my family. I have two sisters and a brother, Jessie (23f), Caden (21m) and Luna (14f). This post is about Luna. We're the only two siblings still living at home and our parents do provide us with food and stuff. But my parents aren't big on chocolate or candies so they never buy them. We can buy our own with our own money once we're old enough to earn some, which is what I do. My parents also have a very bland palate. They don't like curries or stir fries with sauce, they don't do anything spicy at all. Not even a touch of spice. But I love those things. So sometimes I buy stuff to make those things and make curry for myself or I'll make spicy chicken.

So onto Luna. She's the baby of the family and our parents spoiled her way more than the rest of us. They let her get away with being a brat to people and she's not someone I like being around and neither do our older siblings. She always wants to tell us what to do and she demands things. One time my parents were away at a wedding and Jessie and Caden came home to ""babysit"" which was just my parents saying they could stay at the house and eat for free because they paid for it and make sure Luna and I were okay. This was last year and Luna screamed so loud the neighbor came out to see if we were okay, and it was all because she wanted pizza while we wanted ramen. Luna said we couldn't have ramen and we all needed to get pizza. She tried taking the money out of Jessie's hand. She tried to break Jessie and Caden's phones. She even screamed at the neighbor that we wouldn't let her get pizza. Caden found a frozen pizza and Luna screamed more that it wasn't what she wanted.

Another time Caden was home from college and she demanded he take her to her friends house because mom and dad weren't home. She pulled him out of bed. She threatened to break his laptop. Everything.

She's always telling me to do stuff for her and screaming when I say no. So I never buy her anything from what I earn because I honestly don't feel like she deserves it.

Lately she's been getting so jealous of the food I buy myself and she told me to save some for her. I told her no. She told me I can't tell her no and I said I can and I did and I'll do it again. She screamed into my face and demanded I give her some of my food. I said no. She has food in the fridge. She ran and told our parents and like they always do, they backed her and told me I should be willing to share. I told them I would share when she treats me better and gets a way better attitude.

My parents and Luna are pissed. Luna called me a jerk and my parents said I wasn't being generous like they taught me to be.

74,1dv53pk,AITA for cutting ties with my office colleague," 
I started working at my current job and when I joined two more girls joined with me. We instantly started talking when we first met while signing our contract papers. Let's call them girls A and B. I am very extroverted, and I can be friends with basically everyone, girl A is also an extrovert, but she prefers to be friends with girls only and girl B says she's an introvert.
We are from different departments, so we rarely see each other. But I sat alone in a separate room and out of boredom I used to visit girl A where she sat. We were good, girl A started traveling with Girl B so they got close. Eventually, we three became a trio, everyone knew us as three musketeers. We are always together; we eat together in my room as it's a big space and all alone for me and we leave the office together, go out for lunch, etc. 
Girl A and I belong to different religious sects. still, we never fought but Girl B and I often discussed it when we were alone. 
Just like every other colleague, we all shared stories good or bad whatever, but girl B had behavior issues. She talks shit about her father for correcting her and hates her grandparents, especially her grandmother. Literally misbehaved with Girl A and Me over asking HR for something but apologized later. We moved on with it.
after some time, she asked her manager to get permission to shift in my room with me. Her manager said he would talk to higher authorities. she in between started taking my room as if it were hers. how she will put her things and where and how I'll have to move my stuff and she will pray in my room too and start opening cabinets and cupboards without my permission. It got on my nerves, but I didn't say anything as there were no approvals.
but one day when I reached the office, I saw her in my room saying she was moving. I got very upset and spoke to my boss, she said she didn't want to move but her boss forced her to. I cried because my hormones acted a lot xD well, she was sent back to her own space.
Now we all were getting appraisals, and girl A got the same increment amount, but girl B didn't. she was so upset and crying that she didn't deserve this. we tried our best to console her and help her out in whatever way possible. We all got our bonus, but we didn't discuss it openly so as to not hurt her. Yesterday I asked her if she spoke to HR to help us with scholarships for master's as she spoke to HR before regarding it now, I am considering it too, She said she is no longer interested in studying any further I was like okay if you go to HR's office to talk about your increment then ask me to come too as I want to talk too. she said no she won't ask HR for appraisal again; she is so hurt and has let it go. I was checking my employee portal to get my pay slip to ask about the Master's scholarship, turned out the amount written was more than what I got paid. I checked it was her account as she last time logged on to my system and left. I was so shocked that I just spoke to her, she lied? I called Girl A and asked her to see me then I told her about how she hid her appraisal and to my shock she knew about it too. She said Girl B asked her to stay quiet and not tell me just because she told her I wasn't happy when Girl A got the Employee of the Month award. I went like whatttttt?!!! girllll
she showed me the chat and I said like okay let's go to her and ask her why did she do it
she denied it as she is leaving the office and was only here for 4 more days. I out of anger went to girl B and congratulated her for her appraisal, and her first reaction was who told you? without answering I came back to my room.
she later came to my room asking if I was ok? and she didn't tell anyone before me and didn't tell anyone at all so I shouldn't mind. SHE KEPT LYING!!! i was so pissed i asked her to please not to expect me to be ok right now, she told me to take time and left the room
I said nothing on our off time and left for the house without them.
today Girl A came to my room in the morning and was like I told her what she did was wrong. I told her I was going to tell her you told me she asked you to hide it as I can't let her believe I dont know she is spreading things about me and i hate that she is still lying to me
I went out to eat lunch to avoid them from coming to my room for lunch. Girl A texted me and came to speak to me how she is so upset with girlB for doing all this and even told me how girl B used to warn her that I talk behind her I am jealous of her etc. Now Girl B is worried everyone will ask her why she has stopped eating lunch with me and hanging out with me and how everyone will react.",TL;DR,2024-07-04,"AITA for cutting ties with my office colleague

75,1dv525k,AITA for insisting my boyfriend add my laundry when he does his?,"My (32F) boyfriend (32M) has just moved into my house. We're very happy, but have different ideas about housework. I have tended to do laundry on a fairly regular routine -- once per week for clothes, once per week for towels and linens. Water bills are expensive where I live, so I am keen not to waste water by doing unnecessary washing. 

Since my boyfriend moved in, I've been asking him before doing the laundry if he has anything to add, and he will typically throw in his dirty clothes with the once weekly load. I do laundry for both of us. Monday, we did laundry this way and I assumed he'd added everything he needed, but Tuesday he wanted to do another load of just his clothes. I asked him why he hadn't added those in with the first load, and he said it was because in tidying up his ""mancave"" downstairs, he found a few more things that needed to be washed.

We discussed and it came to light that he doesn't think throwing a small load of laundry into the wash whenever he feels like it is that big of a deal, since, in his own words, he would sometimes do a load with only one single towel back at his place if he wanted that particular towel. I think this is wasteful and explained that the water bill isn't a built-in cost at my place as it is at his place, and I asked him, if you do a load outside of the once weekly clothes that I do, could you add any dirty clothes of mine as well. He agreed, but clearly doesn't appreciate having his laundry habits ""policed"". AITA?

I should note that my boyfriend is considerably better off than I am, and has offered to cover the water bill. He has also acknowledged that having grown up wealthy with maids, and not being responsible for his own housekeeping for most of his life has given him a different perspective than mine.

76,1dv49nl,AITA for 'flirting' with my friend's bf?,"Throwaway account here because my friends have reddit too

I (17F) have two friends that are involved in this situation, my friend who I'll call Kelly (18F) and her boyfriend Connor (18M)

Connor and I have been friends for years, since we were like 13. We dated briefly a few years ago but that ended amicably and we were kids anyway so it didn't matter. I became friends with Kelly last year when I started college (UK meaning so high school for the americans) and we've become really close since. Connor and Kelly have been dating since last year too

I text both Kelly and Connor regularly, and I have funny nicknames on Snapchat for all my friends. Connor's is 'Condom' because of an inside joke between us two from years ago especially concerning his name

This nickname takes us to the issue, the other night my group of friends had a party which is one of many we've planned for a week bender following celebrating the end of our A Levels. I was pretty drunk, as was Kelly, and we were sitting outside and chatting. Connor wasn't at this party and we were snapping, Kelly looked over at my phone sat next to me and asked ""Why the fuck is Connor's name condom on your phone?""

I laughed and explained it's our inside joke, but she didn't laugh back. She then asked why we're snapping so much anyway, I said uhh I don't know because we're friends? She then began to get aggressive and say I was trying to take her boyfriend and I honestly can't remember much of what else she said when she began raising her voice because I was drunk and a little taken aback and a few of our friends came over to intervene

I went with a couple of my friends because I was almost in tears to explain the confusing and sudden situation that just happened and I heard Kelly left the party shortly after. I texted her the next morning and she left me on opened. I'm not talking to Connor either because I don't want to anger Kelly further.

I just don't know what to do, I don't think I've done anything wrong. Most of my friends agree with me, but some of my friends and my brother said I shouldn't be nicknaming someone else's boyfriend something sexual and talking to him so much; I didn't think anything of it because Connor has been a close friend for years and the nickname was harmless

77,1dv41p7,"AITA for telling my dad, grandma and my dad's wife that my mom never put me in the middle, they did?","My parents divorced when I (16f) was 3 and my brother Shane (18m) was 5. Shane remembers them fighting a lot back then. I remember none of it. What I do remember is my dad would always stay far away from mom and would sometimes skip things if mom was going to be present. He'd tell me or Shane, or both of us, that he didn't want to be mom's friend so thought it would be easier to stay away. When I was 6 dad met Kim and within 4 months Kim and her daughter Lilah (now 13) moved in with him. Within the next 3 years dad and Kim had my two half siblings, got married in between and Kim moved her mom in to care for her until she died. So it was chaos. Dad also lost his job and made less at his new one.

Shane and I were back and forth between mom and dad. We'd spend a week with mom and then a week with dad. We hated going back then though because it was so chaotic.

Mom was the stable parent for us. She was able to afford to give us a good quality of life that dad struggled to provide. Mom paid for an extra curricular activity for me and Shane each. She made sure we always had enough supplies for school. She bought us nice gifts (we had game consoles at mom's and other stuff that we didn't have at dad's). Over time as Lilah got a little bigger and so did our half siblings, dad and Kim started asking mom to send them money for us or to buy stuff for Lilah and our half siblings too. Mom refused. Dad and Kim hated that. 

They tried to say mom was okay with us suffering and grandma especially said mom should be making sure we didn't feel bad because we had more. Shane and I never felt bad. We knew we had different things because our mom was mom and Kim was our half siblings and Lilah's mom. So different families and different households too. I never felt guilty that we did so well with mom. I never felt like she owed my half siblings or Lilah gifts or food or clothes. Grandpa used to say him and grandma should do more since they were actually family and our mom wasn't and I agree with that. I know Shane does too.

A lot of stuff happened since but a few months ago mom brought me and my two best friends to a concert. Dad knew I was going and he told Kim and Lilah about it, knowing Lilah had wanted to go as well but they couldn't afford it. This became a really big deal. Lilah got so mad at me for it and my dad and Kim got mad at mom because I didn't apologize to Lilah. They said mom put me in the middle of divorce stuff. Then a couple of days ago they were talking about it with grandma and all three said mom made me feel bad by putting me (and Shane) in the middle and making us watch our other siblings suffer while we did so well. Grandpa called them crazy. I told them mom never put me in the middle, they did, and she never made me feel bad for having more because I never felt bad. I knew that comes with having different families. They told me to stop defending mom. Grandpa told them to stop acting like Shane and I need to hate our mom because they do.

78,1dv374n,AITA for refusing to go on a family vacation? ,"I (25F) am refusing to go on holiday with my mother and 5 younger siblings because I’m sick of being around them. I’m not the best at explaining things so please bear with me.

My mom is a single mother and I’m like the ‘second mother’ to my siblings. I do everything for my family and have put my life on hold to help my mom out. I do the school run and pay for almost everything my family needs. My mom isn’t able to drive because of a medical issue atm so I’m her personal driver too. I take her any and everywhere. Sometimes I feel like she doesn’t consider that I’m a human being with my own life and needs. She expects me to drop everything whenever she needs me. There are things my siblings can do that she will always come to me for. She puts a lot of pressure on me to fix things in her life, this has been ongoing since I was a child. I know my mom has some attachment issues but things have gotten way out of hand and I’m fed up.

I’m 25 yet she calls me constantly if I go anywhere. She tries to police where I can go and who I can be around. She always tries to talk me out of plans saying things like ‘why are you leaving me’. Even something as simple as working in a coffee shop she’ll be like ‘you hate us, you can work here why are you leaving your family’? Like wtf? I’m going for a few hours what is your problem? My siblings think it’s ridiculous that I even fall for it or listen to her but she’s going through a lot right now with her health I don’t want to stress her out more. 

Anyway, I always plan family trips and we have a running joke where they all call me the family manager. My siblings say I act more like a mother than our mom does. She just expects me to plan this summers trip but I’m so behind in work (I’m self employed) from dropping everything for her constantly. I want to focus on myself and my business this summer so I said I don’t want to plan the family vacation this year. My 19 year old sister is more than capable of planning it if my mom doesn’t want to. She blew up at me and was being moody with me all morning. She mentioned that I would be paying for it anyway so why not just plan it and book everything. She thinks she’s entitled to my money because she’s my mom. She thinks she’s entitled to my time, that I’m selfish if I stop raising her kids for her etc. I’m fed up. I want my own life I’ve wasted so many years looking after her and her children. It’s not my job. So I told her I’m not going this year. I’ll pay for it if she needs me to but I won’t be there. She’s now in a state and is refusing to talk to me. So AITA?

80,1dv2k9u,AITA for not inviting my sister and her family over for my 4th of July celebration? ,"My fiancé(26F) and I(27M) just bought a new home a couple of months ago. We have been dating for almost 10 years. My family dynamic is a little weird, my sister is the oldest and we have a pretty big age gap. My parents were hardly the type to host any holidays or even celebrate our birthdays (they're not religious they're just different). My sister became a mother at a young age and since starting her own family and all gatherings were hosted in her home (w BIL family). When I met my now fiancé, I brought her around to my sisters gatherings. My fiancé is friendly and talkative so she quickly established a good relationship with my family. We always showed up to all of my sisters gatherings year after year, even if we had to split the day since my fiancé has a large family of her own.
 Fast forward to us buying a home and moving in together. My sister has been acting weird. For example, my fiancé decided to host our first NYE. We reached out weeks in advance that we were going to be hosting for NYE, which they agreed and even asked us what they could bring. Just for them to be a no show and host at their home for my BIL's family. She never texted saying sorry we can't make it...till today the matter was never spoken of. For Super Bowl Sunday, they hosted but we never got an invitation. I only found out because my mom had asked if I was going (we were already going over to my fiancée's sisters house so I didn't feel that shitty). I also let that go, and never brought it up because I'm not the kind to hold any grudges. I invited them over for my birthday dinner along with my fiancées family and they showed up but were not being their usual selves. Mind you they have already been around my fiances family, they're amazing humble people (I'm not being biased lol). Then in this past month of June I also hosted another dinner with just my fiance mom, and brother (dad didn't show up). Had reached out to my sister with time in advance she responded but again was a no show. These are some of the few of many times and I have not even lived in my new home for a year. I don't understand what I have done wrong, I'm starting to think it's some sort of jealousy (my sister and BIL's family are always in competition with each other). Some context to that, they will down play anyone who has achieved more than they have and make it seem like they have more, just so they can stay on top. It's honestly weird to me on how they stay on top of what everyone else is doing instead of focusing on themselves. My fiancée's family kind speculates it's some sort of jealousy because the day we had a housewarming party...they were sharing they were going to buy a new home (never happened).

I was surprised that the ballot papers hadn't arrived, then discovered yesterday that they had, but he'd put them face down on the kitchen table, and hadn't mentioned to me they'd arrived, he hadn't even looked at what the post was.

I was pretty upset because by the time I discovered it was too late to vote. I forgive him but asked that in the future, when he brings the post up to our apartment, if there's post for me that he put it on my desk (it's on the way from the front door to the kitchen). 

He thinks this is absolutely unreasonable to ask. He thinks it's an enormous amount of effort to change his habit from ""pick up the post and put it down anywhere"" to ""pick up the post, look at what it is, and put it somewhere sensible accordingly"".

2.  starting Sunday night thru Wednesday please try and be quiet i work those days.

3. make a mess clean it up. help clean the yard and around the house

4. they smoke weed i dont care not in the house

  
everything was going good for the first few months. and honestly since breaking up with my boyfriend it was kinda nice having someone to talk too. then slowly it started going down hill. my niece spills juice on the floor and it wasnt mopped up. or dishes being left in the sink. or food being left out. or dirty clothes, deliveries being left in the living room. things getting broke and they denying it. their room and bathroom being dirty. my sister claimed she was too tired because she did find another job. they tried leaving my niece with me after getting off of a 12 hr shift. and when i did agree to watch her oh just for an hour turned into 8 hours.  then all of a sudden they couldnt afford the rent. would eat all of my food and not replace anything. things really hit the fan when my electric bill was 800 dollars. and my sister response was what? are we suppose to sweat to death.?i was aware they were running the air conditioning all day. they refuse to pay more than the agreed 500 dollars. i told them i wouldnt charge them rent for the next month but that i wanted them out. 

  
sister got mad and they did move out but she went around telling everyone who would listen that i heartlessly threw them out. i got a lot of backlash from family and friends. but nope im petty. and the good thing about being a nurse is i dont have time to talk on the phone. so i posted on Facebook and instagram all of the text messages and photos of what they did to my house. the texts clearly showed them agreeing they owed me rent money. they left my house a mess. there was mold in the bathroom they were using. and that i was charging them only 500 and not the 1500 they were claiming. sister and bil got told off by our parents and now she upset that i expose them like that.

everything was going good for the first few months. and honestly since breaking up with my boyfriend it was kinda nice having someone to talk too. then slowly it started going down hill. my niece spills juice on the floor and it wasnt mopped up. or dishes being left in the sink. or food being left out. or dirty clothes, deliveries being left in the living room. things getting broke and they denying it. their room and bathroom being dirty. my sister claimed she was too tired because she did find another job. they tried leaving my niece with me after getting off of a 12 hr shift. and when i did agree to watch her oh just for an hour turned into 8 hours.  then all of a sudden they couldnt afford the rent. would eat all of my food and not replace anything. things really hit the fan when my electric bill was 800 dollars. and my sister response was what? are we suppose to sweat to death.?i was aware they were running the air conditioning all day. they refuse to pay more than the agreed 500 dollars. i told them i wouldnt charge them rent for the next month but that i wanted them out. 

  
sister got mad and they did move out but she went around telling everyone who would listen that i heartlessly threw them out. i got a lot of backlash from family and friends. but nope im petty. and the good thing about being a nurse is i dont have time to talk on the phone. so i posted on Facebook and instagram all of the text messages and photos of what they did to my house. the texts clearly showed them agreeing they owed me rent money. they left my house a mess. there was mold in the bathroom they were using. and that i was charging them only 500 and not the 1500 they were claiming. sister and bil got told off by our parents and now she upset that i expose them like that.

84,1dv158v,AITA if I don’t want to in contact with my “dad” or half sisters after 12 years? ,"Backstory: My mom always told me I was an “accident” but a blessing because at the time she needed me. My grandma passed months before this occurred and my mom was at a young age. At the time she trusted my “dad” and during dating she ended up pregnant.

How she got pregnant you may ask… this sneaky mf POKED A HOLE IN THE CONDOM. How did my mom find out… because he told a friend that he was going to get my mom pregnant. Of course she broke it off with him but said he could see me.

Want to know the reason why he never really saw me? Since they couldn’t be together he didn’t want me lol. Fast forward to when I first met him. I was 7 years old. My mom tried to give it a try ( don’t know the backstory ) but he saw me about 3 times total. One time against my moms Will he picked me up from school. I remembered he took me to a store and left the door open and told a person in another car ( he knew ) to watch me. You can imagine how me and my mom felt after he left again. Turns out he was just trying to get back with my mom.

Fast forward: 12 years ( currently 19 ) my half sister asked me if I was his child. I replied yes and then she put me in a group chat with two other people. Turns out he abandoned 4 girls in total. He was in contact with 1 and she was the youngest. Turns out he moved and is playing stepdad with another women. Which I knew because when I got into my teens I googled his facebook. He bragged about my grades or my art being in the newspaper. In total I saw me on his page about 3 times but that was all from when he saw me at 7. At the time it had hurt and I cried but realized I got a step dad that was with me for way longer.

I always knew I had other siblings (due to the Facebook ) and when they added me in the group chat I just felt no connection. I’m the oldest of the females but I just didn’t want to continue talking to them. To be fair I don’t really like talking to anyone unless they my cloooooseeee family ( brother,sister,mom) In the group chat the youngest one was saying that he is in the hospital and that I should reach out. I declined because I don’t have no love or liking to him anymore. 

Afterwards I stopped responding but in reality I felt like I had no connection to my “sisters” and they had their own so why would they need me. Plus when I was discussing this with my mom my little sister ( in her early teens ) seemed sad so my mom had to act like it’s a joke. I built such a connection with my sister and we seen and been through so much. I just feel like my energy should go on her. I love the bond I have with her and I’m not looking to replace her. I don’t even have a best friend because i consider my sister my bestfriend and frankly I don’t have an ounce of love for the other 3 “sisters”. Does that make me an asshole?

85,1dv0zr7,AITA for distancing/ not reaching out to one of the few childhood friends I have left ,"Background: In my 20s, I often felt like I was the one maintaining friendships by reaching out to others. Now, in my 30s, I decided to test who would reach out to me without my initiation. Unsurprisingly, few did. Consequently, I distanced myself from some people, focusing my energy elsewhere. While understanding that people have busy lives, I still noticed a lack of effort from many.

I had three childhood friends left. One, ""Amy"" (not her real name), still lives in our home state while I moved south. Amy often mentioned hanging out when I visit. Recently, I returned to our hometown for some doctor's appointments. I informed Amy about my plans a month prior, and she suggested hanging out. I expressed my availability but received no follow-up. During a local event, Amy reached out after seeing my social media post, and we briefly met. She again suggested hanging out before I left town, to which I agreed.

Incident: Amy texted me late on a Saturday, inviting me to a club with her & my ex coworker ""Sarah."" Though annoyed by the last-minute invitation and Sarah's annoying tendencies, I agreed. I went alone because my girlfriend dislikes both Amy & Sarah. The club was in a sketchy area, and I waited 20 minutes for Amy and her friends to arrive. Once there, Sarah started making rude comments about me, including accusing me of badmouthing Amy. Despite the tension, I reiterated that anything I said to Sarah, I had also said to Amy directly.

After the night out, Amy suggested another meetup without our girlfriends to avoid any drama. We agreed on Tuesday or Wednesday evening. However, Amy forgot to mark it on her calendar, and by the time she remembered, the agreed dates had passed. She then suggested another meetup on Saturday, including her girlfriend again, which contradicted her earlier request for a drama-free meetup.

Resolution: Frustrated, I made a petty post on social media about valuing people who make you feel seen and appreciated, which Amy and Sarah saw. Amy's inconsistency and lack of effort made me realize our friendship might be over. I'm down to two childhood friends and feel exhausted from overextending myself for people who don't reciprocate.

87,1dv0rho,AITA for defending my friends against my family,"Backstory: I live with my family (not parents) and they have 4 kids. I’m basically there to be close to school and I watch their kids everyday. The family takes care of all expenses except school fees, but I carry more than my own weight around the house and I have my own income.

My friends and I had a picnic at a neighborhood park, we’re all in college and our picnic spread was just snacks and sodas.  We’re just having a good time, laughing, making jokes and playing card games. The family matriarch (we’re close, like sister/mother relationship) messaged me and asked me to do something for the kids when I had the time, I sent her a video of me with the picnic spread showing and I messaged back saying “I’m out with friends, I can do it once I get home.”  Not that long after I sent that video, two of the kids I lived with showed up to the park - let’s call them kid A and kid B.

Kid A is screeching at us in the bushes, and does so for a solid 15 mins before we start screeching back (not knowing it was “my” kids) and they stay hidden until I see kid B walk up to the park and I go up to say hi to both of them. All my friends wave hello and I ask the kids if they wanted to grab a soda or a snack and they said no and went off to play so I went back to my friends. 

Fast forward an hour later and it’s almost 9:30 PM and the kids are still playing, pushing each other around (kid B is older and picks on kid A a lot). I call out to them and tell them to head home because it’s getting late, they play the “what?! what did you say?” game with me and around the 10th time one of my other friend’s come in and yells for the kids to go home - and the kids become quiet and finally say okay. I go up to say goodbye and offer more snacks before they leave - which they decline - and instruct them to call me when they get home (we live down the street). 

After they get home, I get a message from the matriarch telling me that she’ll kick my friend’s ass for yelling at the kids. I explain to her what happened and she goes off on me saying that my friend’s and I don’t own the neighborhood and that we need to grow up because we were being so loud because one of the residents that live by the park messaged her asking who the loud crowd was at the park and to not yell at the kids because they just wanted to come over and say hi because of my video. 

I defended my friend’s actions, but because I live with my family I had to shut up and apologize for my friend and say that it wasn’t their intent to be harsh to the kids. My family is really close and I don’t want the story to be twisted to where my friends and I are stereotypical college bitches.

88,1dv0r1l,AITA for asking to call my Gf during her break at work,"
The title is misleading,  but I didn’t know what else to label it. I also can’t talk to my friends about it and I need some external opinions on it.

This is a weird and long story. For context: We are both 19 she has 2 jobs on for weekdays and one for weekends. The weekday job gave her a work phone which she is allowed to use for personal reasons. She doesn’t have a sim in her actual phone because she just doesn’t want it. The rule for her work phone is that she isn’t allowed to use it to make money.

 Now the story: we didn’t talk much for a couple of days since we are both very busy people and she was at her weekend job which doesn’t have wifi. So the only way I could contact her was through her work phone (which we have texted through before), I asked her when her break would be so that we could call for a bit since I missed her. She replied instantly and basically told me she doesn’t know when her break is in an annoyed way. I told her when she finds out just lmk. She starts telling me that I’m in trouble for texting her through her work phone ( we’ve talked through it before) I say I don’t understand why. 

She calls me screaming at me and cursing me out telling me how I broke her rule which made no sense to me, so I told her it makes no sense she continues to just curse me out and scream at me so I got defensive and angry as well since I clearly wasn’t going to get a response. 

We don’t talk for a couple of hours until her shift finishes btw no call on her break :( 
Alright so she let it slip that she can take a break whenever she wants which is still confusing to me. I continually got blamed for texting her since it looks like I’m her supervisor asking her when her break is which could break the rule (doesn’t make sense since we’ve talked on it before). So I told her that. 

She called me little a b*tch for not letting it go, but I kept telling her that it wasn’t about the call more about how she acted. 

The after math is that she saying I’m crazy and thought she was cheating which is why I was so angry by it and I’m saying she spoke and treated me horribly. 


At the end of the day this is from my perspective a lot more arguing went into it but I tried to summarize it. 

Did I over react, am I actually crazy, like is there something I don’t understand. Ask questions and I’ll answer. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-04,"AITA for asking to call my Gf during her break at work

I hate when my brother uses MY xbox.,"I am 17, i have a ps5 and xbox series s. i really don’t mind with my siblings borrowing my consoles just as long as they bring back to my room after. With my brother though he acts like it’s his xbox. Whenever he would borrow my ps5 he would bring it back right after he’s finished playing. But when it’s the xbox that he wants to play with it, he wouldn’t bring it back until i say ima play it. Then when i finally play the xbox… the next 5 hours he asks if he can play it again not even giving me time. i shouldn’t even be asking him that I wanna play my xbox

Most of the time he wouldn’t even play it, he just asks for it just for it to stay in his room. this gets me mad because im all waiting for weeks feeling bad thinking as long as he can play but no he doesn’t even play it. Just today i asked for it back to play it, i’ve barely got on because i was tired. 4 hours goes by and he asks for it again. Then while he’s getting the xbox he tells me “are you going to get the new Dead Rising  on your ps5?”. he already bought it on the xbox already. He’s most likely saying this is so he can just hog the xbox even more. he forces me saying i should i buy Dead rising and just play online games with my friends on the ps5 when i play with them on the xbox. l tell him i dont have ps plus but he offers to pay for it but that’s not the point. The point is MY XBOX has all the good games for online and i dont want to rebuy them on my ps5. I really dont know what to do from this point forward. Any ideas what i should i do? Should i get over it?

The point is MY XBOX has all the good games for online and i dont want to rebuy them on my ps5. I really dont know what to do from this point forward. Any ideas what i should i do? Should i get over it?

90,1dv0coh,AITAH? Planted a tree in our community's community-garden without regard to the wishes of my neighbor,"My neighbor has ADHD along with some other psychological problems I think. She tends to rant and not listen to people, and I often feel disrespected. She has accused me many time of interrupting her, and gotten obviously upset, but during conversations I get literally one word in before she interrupts me, and I just let it happen and say nothing, with literally 95% of the words being spoken by her. I feel like she thinks she has authority over me and/or thinks that I am lower class.

I was just having a conversation with her and saying I need to repot a fruit tree that I have kept in a pot. She started ranting saying not to plant it in the garden because it will shade her flowers. She is the only one who uses the ""community garden"", and has followed me around ranting at me about this before while I was politely trying to extricate myself multiple times.

I literally told her multiple times I don't really care about the plant. I never said that I was planning on planting it in the community garden. I honestly was going to plant it in a bigger pot that I have.

She kept saying that this big oak is shading the garden, which is true, but she never acknowledges that it is growing 40 feet to the south of the garden.

Also in the middle of summer many of our plants have died because they are not getting enough water, and are getting way too much sun.

I kept trying to explain to her that shade occurs mostly on the north side of trees and that the sun is lower in the sky in the winter. And she would not listen and treat me like I'm an idiot.

I finally started saying you're not listening, after trying to walk away and saying I don't care about the plant that much anyway multiple times.

I finally got mad, and eventually ended up saying ""fuck you, fuck you!"" I can't remember how it got to that. That was not acceptable.  I should have said I feel disrespected and it's not okay with me or something like that.

I then went back outside and planted the tree right in the middle of the community garden (she was gone) in a dirt area where nothing else was growing, and put some heavy rocks around its trunk. It does block line of sight with one of her flower bushes from the walk way, and it will cause shade to that flower bush and probably a variety of other plants, but not nearly enough shade to cause any interference with their needs for enough light to flower, because it is close to the northernmost part of the garden so the shade it will cast will be beyond the garden.

The next day I noticed that the rocks had been moved significantly (they were in contact with the trunk and the trunk had a couple of significant scrapes in it) and one of the tree's branches had been broken off.

She came up to me today and ranted at me, telling me to ""do the right thing"" in a blatantly angry tone of voice.

My personal thought is that IATAH for saying FU but not for planting the tree, and just wanted to see what other people thought.  Thanks.

Also, can't plant trees anywhere besides the garden because insurance won't let them be planted next to houses (supposedly a fire danger), and I believe it is coincidentally a great spot for the tree and will make the garden way more beautiful.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-04,"AITAH?

recently though, one of my older boy cousins got this one girl from our school pregnant. and i say girl and boy instead of man or woman because they're both 18 (no judgment to either of them from me, but their ages are important to see where i'm coming from). because it's against a lot of our family's customs, the two decided to basically get engaged and stay together to take care of the baby. a*nd because they're together*, my aunt decided she wanted to throw a baby shower for my cousin's girlfriend and she asked me to do a taualuga for her (basically dancing alone).

now here's my issue; i *do not* like my cousin's girlfriend. she was a huge part of why i felt isolated in a PWI because she and the other islander kids made fun of me for being more white-washed (the reason being because i can't speak our language as well as them). i felt like i could connect with no one because she'd talk crap about me behind my back to literally everyone, calling me plastic and what not, and i know it might seem really small, but these comments really hurt me because i was already struggling with my cultural identity (i'm mixed, but i resonate with my samoan side more because i don't have contact with my other side's family at all).

with that info out there, when my aunt asked me to do the dance, i said no. i didn't tell her about the teasing that my cousin's girlfriend would do, but i did say i didn't want to do it because i barely knew her and it made no sense to me. that part is where i feel like i was the asshole and did too much because i definitely could have been less snappy with how i went about it but i feel like for me to dance alone, it has to be really important and honestly? this just doesn't seem as important to me considering who it's for.

my aunts and all the older people are calling me petty for not wanting to do one dance for my future nephew/niece and saying it's out of respect, but my cousins are telling me to stand by it because i don't have to dance for her if i don't want to. i don't know though, apart of me feels really bad about not dancing because as much as i don't like her, a lot of my family and hers don't support her situation and i don't wanna make her feel isolated because as much as i don't like her, she's still gonna be apart of my family and i want to support my cousin. i don't want any drama in my family either, so am i wrong?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-04,"AITA for not dancing at my cousin's baby shower? okay so honestly this post in my opinion is really cringy for me to write considering i only use reddit to find sims mods but i'm having genuine family problems and i just want to be done with everything.

97,1duz6qf,AITA for being rude to my family while they are helping me financially?,"I’m 22 years old, recently graduated college, & as the title states, I don't have a job. Now, I have been actively searching since graduation and my luck has just not been the best, but I am still pushing forward. However, this has not gone over quite well with my parents.

Obviously, they want the best for me, but they have been hounding me about my being unemployed and assuming I'm not putting in the effort. During these arguments, they have brought up how grateful I should be that they are letting me stay at home as well as how they are paying for a majority of my living expenses. My response to these arguments is what one would consider “giving attitude” and my parents do not take too kindly to that. But two points: these arguments happen at least once a week, and my anger is not just aimed at the job convos.

The bigger issue lies in the fact that I am an undiagnosed neurodivergent and queer kid living in a homophobic household with parents that aren't very understanding of neurodivergent conditions (hence the reason I'm undiagnosed).

Since I was little, I was bullied and ostracized for being different, and my parents weren't too thrilled about this. To try and better my school experience, they suggested I mold myself to act like other kids to lessen my chances of being ridiculed. This came from a place of love, but only caused me to doubt myself, always cater to others, and not truly know who I am. (I should also add, that my family never stopped making fun of me for my interests, on top of not wanting to understand any of my neurodivergent symptoms and how they could best accommodate, like maybe not touching me without asking).

The homophobia is pretty straightforward, though the backstory on that is I came out to them completely on accident. I won't go into the details, but I did not want them to know about my queer identity until I was financially independent. But they found out anyway, and I now have to deal with hateful comments at least once a month, more so now that I am living at home full-time.

I do want to point out that having experienced living on my own at college, I got to enjoy some well-earned freedom from my parents. Being on my own was something I never experienced before, and it was nice not having to be criticized by them 24/7. Now, being back home with practically no escape has caused me to get a bit agitated at times. I want alone time, but if I’m not spending every moment job hunting, I’m essentially “wasting my time”.

My agitation with the whole situation has caused me at times to be argumentative with my family for one reason or another. I don't mean it, and would rather be able to have time to myself, but I don't have that freedom right now. Plus, talking things out with my family seems like a non-starter because they do not believe they've ever done anything wrong to me (which my self-doubt and insecurities say otherwise).

(I should also add, that my family never stopped making fun of me for my interests, on top of not wanting to understand any of my neurodivergent symptoms and how they could best accommodate, like maybe not touching me without asking).

The homophobia is pretty straightforward, though the backstory on that is I came out to them completely on accident. I won't go into the details, but I did not want them to know about my queer identity until I was financially independent. But they found out anyway, and I now have to deal with hateful comments at least once a month, more so now that I am living at home full-time.

I do want to point out that having experienced living on my own at college, I got to enjoy some well-earned freedom from my parents. Being on my own was something I never experienced before, and it was nice not having to be criticized by them 24/7. Now, being back home with practically no escape has caused me to get a bit agitated at times. I want alone time, but if I’m not spending every moment job hunting, I’m essentially “wasting my time”.

My agitation with the whole situation has caused me at times to be argumentative with my family for one reason or another. I don't mean it, and would rather be able to have time to myself, but I don't have that freedom right now. Plus, talking things out with my family seems like a non-starter because they do not believe they've ever done anything wrong to me (which my self-doubt and insecurities say otherwise).

So, AITA for being rude to my family while they are helping me financially?",1.0,1.0423344373703003,1,1

99,1duys4g,AITAH for excluding my ex wife’s kids?,"Made a Reddit account specifically to ask this question because it’s been bothering me. A little background information, my wife and I separated a few years ago. It was a bit tumultuous because she was pregnant with our second child at the time and the pregnancy was causing a lot of issues. I had endured her mood swings during the first pregnancy but this time was different. She friggin HATED me, and we’d get into fights in front of our first born who was four at the time. It got to the point where I couldn’t even go home without getting into some kind of confrontation so I got us counseling which didn’t help in spite of how expensive it was. We separated shortly after. Once the second baby arrived we were able to peacefully divorce and I ended up with split custody. My ex and I have been rotating weeks with the kids ever since and it’s honestly worked out okay. Until recently that is.

See, she’s since had two more kids with her new partner, and the other day I was on the phone with her to arrange pickup because it’s my week and she asked if I could also watch her two other kids cause I guess her boyfriend is going on a hunting trip or something, she has to work and there’s no one else who can do it. I said no and we got into yet another fight. First fight in years. She started yelling at me over the phone about how her two youngest get sad when their big brothers leave for the week, and how they feel like they’re missing out, and how I’m selfish for not accommodating them, and how it’s not their fault and blah blah blah… I didn’t give a reason as to why I wasn’t going to watch her two youngest, I just said no, and that was that.

Anyway, I feel guilty now. She had some good points. Her two youngest didn’t ask to be born, all the stuff their mother and I went through isn’t their fault, and they deserve to be safe and happy just like all other kids, but I just can’t bring myself to do it. I’m sure I could, but I’m picturing all four boys sitting in my living room and I’m thinking about how seeing those two kids who aren’t mine sitting there in my home would be a crushing reminder of everything that went wrong between myself the person I thought I’d be spending the rest of my life with. It hurts just thinking about it.

Anyway, am I being a selfish bastard?

Edit: thank you for all the replies. Sorry if I don’t get around to all of them. I did get one scornful message from a user who will remain nameless about how weak of an individual I am for leaving my wife while she was pregnant, and how my kids would be better off without me, but… oh well I guess.

I was conflicted on whether or not I should make an appearance and finally see him again in the flesh. I told him I would try to be there.

102,1duyi2y,AITA for refusing to travel interstate for my sister’s 50th birthday party?,"About a year and a half ago, I (42m) moved back to my home country after living abroad for 10 years. My last job overseas was at a toxic startup where I experienced emotional and verbal abuse from the directors, which caused serious depression and anxiety. This stress led to more overworking and pretty severe illness. 

Eventually, I left the job and due to visa sponsorship deadlines I returned home, my relationship also ended at that time, making things even tougher. 

My sister (49) and I had an okay relationship, so she offered me a place to stay when I returned. Her large house had plenty of space, and I had my own bathroom. The agreement was $250 per week for board, covering food and utilities, starting the Monday after I arrived. 

I didn't have a job lined up and struggled to find one despite my extensive experience in the creative industry and as a university lecturer. Two months passed without an securing a job, and I was feeling down, grieving my past situation, career, and relationship. Although I helped around the house and actively searched for work, my sister and her family perceived me as antisocial and unappreciative because I spent a lot of time in my room processing my feelings. 

During a drive with my sister, she aggressively confronted me about my situation, stating I was antisocial, and suggesting I should take any job, even scrubbing toilets. And that ultimately I couldn't live with her for too much longer, or continue to subject her family to me being there. I understood, but the conversation heightened my anxiety. Then she said ""I'm only saying this because I love you"". 

Soon after, I found a job advertised at her company (in a different department) and asked for her help. She agreed initially (with conditions) but later backed out, saying she didn't want me to apply. Disappointed, I decided to move across the country to live with my parents and try finding work there. It was also difficult finding a job and living with my parents, but there was less pressure. Two months later, I learned my sister was quitting her job for a higher-paying one.

I felt gaslit and betrayed because she had caused me so much stress and anxiety while I stayed with her and then refused to help me get a job she was planning to leave. This has deeply affected our relationship. 

Now, with her 50th birthday approaching, my family expect me to travel interstate for her celebration but I refuse to go. My parents and brother are insisting I do, saying I'm being immature and mean for not wanting to celebrate with the family.

It’s been a nightmare of arguing and screaming because my brother still has to get to LAX Sunday afternoon and we still aren’t really on good terms with everything going on and my wife refuses to let him or Josh back in the house and I don’t know if things will ever be civil enough to take him back to LAX on Sunday.

107,1duxv0n,AITA for having an opinion about my partner's finances?,"My partner and I have been together for 3 years. We are both in our late 20s and at the early stages of our careers. Although we do not live together yet, it is a pretty serious relationship, and we are moving in a very positive direction.

With that being said, we have one major issue - financial onenesses and alignment. My personal mantra is live within your means, have balance, and prioritizing living in the moment while also saving for the future. My partner's mindset is a little different, he values living within your means, but is willing to throw that idea out the window when something really exciting comes up, and abandons the practice of balance very often.

When I voice my opinion, he states that we don't live together, we don't have shared financial obligations, so I shouldn't have a say over how he spends his money. However, I come back at him and argue if we are in a serious relationship, we should work together, and live our lives in similar manners, and have shared goals/habits/practices.

108,1duxul1,AITA for not inviting my friend to the beach,"Backstory. B (23M) and T (24M) are my (23F) longest friendships stemming back to childhood, I met J (22F) and P (23F) in college. I feel fairly equally close to all four of my close friends. 

Last year, we all went to the Beyoncé concert. T decided to stay with me in my apartment for a week while visiting for the concert. Right before T arrived, the AC unit in my apartment broke. It was 90 degrees indoors almost every single day that T was here. J, P, T, and I all booked a hotel and took a night away from the heat. The trip went super smoothly and it was a blast and we agreed we should go on another trip together some day. B came to me after that and told me he was upset he wasn’t invited to the beach with us. I told him we could go another time. Considering we’re broke and he moved back home, that never happened. I still would like to go to the beach with him someday but we haven’t talked about it since then. This takes us to today’s problem. 

I love B, but realistically he doesn’t reach out to me as often as my other close friends. B doesn’t really know P and J because he rarely visits me. I’ve been living in this space for 2yrs and he has only visited my apartment about 6 times, even when he was my neighbor. P and J are also introverted and get uncomfortable around people they don’t know. They do feel comfy with T because anyone involved in that AC situation is basically a blood brother now. 

A month ago I started planning a beach trip with J and P because we all have jobs now and P is going to be moving soon for school. J and I decided to invite T again this year and J also invited her brother whom we game with a lot, but to me this trip is for P, J, and me to have one last big hangout before P leaves. T told me about a week after planning the trip that B is upset we’re going without him he told B to come talk to me about it if he’s upset. I understand wanting to be included, but B hasn’t reached out to me about it yet. B (according to T) has been talking to his other friends abt his feelings on the trip and his friends S and L agree that it’s a “shitty thing to do” apparently. I’m not angry at B for venting to others as he historically is not great at communicating his feelings, but I wish he would come to me so that he can understand my side. What I am angry about is that I feel B is being hypocritical. 

B and his friends S and L know each other from college and they’re even planning on moving in together. Not only this, but for years the 3 of them have been going to events together and I never got one invite to any of them. I’ve never even gotten an invite to chill at their place before. B even frequently visits Philly for work and has never stopped by to see me. I’ve never felt left behind when it comes to B and his friends because I understand that they’re just a separate group.

(Post title may be grammatically incorrect — sorry about that!)

Ever since I entered into a new relationship, I felt like some things changed for the worse. While I am definitely happier now with my current partner (IRL, now) compared to a previous, later-painful LDR I went through for 4 years, in exchange of the happiness and contentment I have now—has to be a troublesome series of events. 

After my last relationship ended, I was open to a small amount of people about it—including my best friend. We’ve been friends since high school, and to admit here too, I used to have a crush on him, and he later felt the same way. However, as I got older and pursued other things in my life such as getting into a good college, and my LDR which was in December of 2019, I noticed my best friend tried to make some moves on me, though he was also being subtle whenever he could. I’ve been dismissing his moves even since our first time meeting—that despite the small (yet long) crush I had on him, I still only viewed him as an older brother figure to me in the end.

So when he’s gotten word of my breakup, he sent me a quick message that I *know* I saw five seconds before he deleted it, saying “So I really don’t have a chance?” which implied, that until now after all these years, he’s maintained some kind of romantic feelings for me. No wonder he’s complained to me about relationship problems such as finding a girlfriend or how, even if it was clear he never approved of my LDR before, admitted a few times how jealous he was that I seemed happy in my relationship. But I guess I was too oblivious to realize he was jealous because I was in a relationship with somebody that’s NOT him.

And now. With my new IRL relationship, he’s dropped a TON of hints I knew were directed towards me, every time I’d post pictures of me and my partner (M, going 21) together on, say, Facebook. He’d view my FB Stories and then later, using the FB Messenger notes feature, write things such as “you never even gave me a chance,” and most recently, (last night actually) “i no longer need you,” which really hurt me. Whether that most recent Note was pertaining to me or not, it terrifies me because of the possibility of losing my best friend.

I’ve almost lost my ex-boyfriend as a friend, and my online BFF, too. I can’t lose my longtime best friend either. Am I the asshole for hurting his feelings by being happy with another?

I just want my best friend back. I know I hurt him for choosing another over him. But does this also mean I’d have to take some kind of action for him if it means saving what’s left of our almost 8-year friendship? I love my partner now, I do, but I’m afraid his loyalty isn’t the only thing being tested now (he knows about my friend), but also my best friend’s. Am I the asshole?

110,1duxfyj,AITAH for not letting my daughter go to her paternal family’s 7/4 celebrations tomorrow?,"For context, I am a 27yo single mother with a 2yo child. I was friends with the bio father for about 3 years during a time in my life where I used spicy sleep as a form of self harm. During that time I got pregnant with my daughter and made the fully informed decision to continue with the pregnancy and get my life together for her. The bio father (we can call him Max) already had 3-4 kids he had little to no contact with out of a mixture of difficult baby mamas and just general lack of desire/motivation to try and be more involved on his part. Part of my decision to continue with the pregnancy was knowing he would most likely not be involved, although I gave him every chance to be. The assumption that he wouldn’t be involved hurt his feelings and he went back to his most previous baby mama (a complete psycho who we will call Sara). I continued reaching out throughout my pregnancy with little to no response from him until I hit nine months and told him that he could be in this child’s life, all he had to do was reach out and tell me how he wanted to be in her life. At this point he had already requested to be left off the birth certificate as I was having a girl and not a boy and he already had 3 daughters and only wanted to be on the birth certificate if she’d been a boy so he could pass on his last name, child support be damned. {I have known since middle school that I would be a single mother if I ever had kids, trauma kind of fucked with my ability to be in a relationship so this was preferred}
But I hit nine months and told him that it was in or out. If I received no response from him after this then the ball would be officially in his court and I would no longer make an effort to include him and that I would take no answer as an answer. I got no answer from him. So I had the baby and surrounded her with a village of my family and friends as well as family from his side who I’d been getting to know throughout my pregnancy. His family has been so loving and good to us both, I love his mom and stepdad and siblings, they all have a part in my child’s life. For the longest time, they have been nothing but respectful and understanding of my boundaries as far as Max is concerned. 
Well in October of 2023 (my daughter was 16mo) he reached out. He was trying to get his life back in order and wanted to be friends again. We talked a little bit, it was awkward and not going anywhere. He didn’t respond a lot in regards to pictures or information about this beautiful child he had a minuscule part in creating, and even loaded me down with questions about his other children I have contact with when I briefly mentioned them. He asked me twice over the course of two weeks to hang out but I wasn’t sure why he was asking (as in, I didn’t know if it was to talk about our child or if it was just to hang out or if for some godforsaken reason he might have been expecting spicy sleep). I told him no, I couldn’t justify losing even more time with my daughter when I was working 6-7 days a week between a full time job and part time on weekends just to hang out with someone who seemingly had no interest in her. Had he specified that his intent was to discuss being in her life then I would have said yes. I later found out from his mom that Max thought Sara had bugged his phone and so he wasn’t comfortable being specific about anything, hence all the short replies and vague requests. I told her that he could borrow a phone from his family I have contact with or buy a new one and get a new number (which he should have been able to afford). I don’t believe it is my responsibility to reach out to him when I’ve made it clear that all he has to do is know what he wants and ask for it. It’s been 9 months since and he still hasn’t reached out to me about her. In that 9 months, he rebuilt his relationship with his mom and stepdad and siblings, and even got his visitation back with his first two children. There were a couple issues when this first started happening where he would show up at his moms house on the days when she had the babe (not for the babe, mind you, but to see his brother/get stuff he left over the day before) but his mom put a stop to it telling him that she didn’t want to lose visitations with the babe by not respecting my boundaries. I mean, up until this week she has been nothing but understandable. I’ve explained that the babe is to the point of remembering faces and until we (max and I) have some form of communication, I don’t feel comfortable with him being in the babes space. How am I supposed to react if she goes up to him unprompted? Why would I put myself or my child through something that uncomfortable and potentially traumatizing? 
Anyways, flash forward to this week, she messaged me saying that the babe and I are invited to her house for fireworks and food and a good time.. but that Max would be there. I let her know i would think about it, and a couple days later I told her that we wouldn’t be there due to his presence. That despite the buffers, I didn’t feel comfortable with him being around her at all until we had even a smidgen of communication. 
Well while I was driving to work today, she messaged saying that they’ll miss us tomorrow and while she doesn’t fully understand she does respect my boundaries. And then ten minutes later she messaged a separate long message about something completely different and blew my phone up with pictures she found of the babe like she was trying to bury the original text. I ignored the original text and just responded to the photos but I know this has to be dealt with before all the upcoming holidays. So am I the asshole for not taking my daughter over to celebrate the fourth with her other grandparents? Instead we’ll be going to my mom’s and doing something smaller but just as fun for her at the ripe age of 2. I’m trying to get my thoughts in order before Friday which is the other grandmothers day to watch the babe while I work.

111,1duxb68,AITA for asking my friend to be in my wedding and not his girlfriend?,"Throwaway.

I'm getting married in Sept. While planning, we ran into an issue that my fiancé has more people he wants included than I do. He has 3 brothers, a cousin, & 2 friends he wants as groomsmen. I have 1 sister, & 3 girlfriends. 

In my friend group are the 3 women I asked to be in the wedding, & 2 guys. My fiance though of asking those guys to be ""bridesmen"". I thought it might be a little weird, but ultimately decided that it was a neat idea. 

We all live in different states now, so I called to ask them to be bridesmen. One of the guys - John - is dating one of the girls I asked, & after some initial confusion, he said yes. The other friend - Ben - is where the issue came in. He has a girlfriend that he has been dating for like 2 years. I've met her a few times & like her, but we aren't close. I asked him if he would be in the wedding & he agreed.



Later, in our group chat, Ben asked ""what color do you want us wearing?"". I thought the ""we"" meant the bridal party. I sent them a green swatch to match ties & dresses to.



This past weekend, I came back to my hometown to get everyone get together for a ""bachelorette"" party. Everyone who had partners brought them. The next day we got together for brunch. Near the, Ben's girlfriend asked me to okay a dress. I thought this was weird for her as a guest, but she showed it to me & it was the same shade of green that I had picked. I told her I would prefer if guests didn't wear the exact shade because it might be confusing. She asked what I meant, & I explained that if she matched the bridal party, people might think she's a bridesmaid & I just didn't want that, but that if the dress came in a different color that it was pretty. She said okay & dropped it.



Later, Ben calls me & asks what I said to her. I said what happened & he said ""but you literally asked us to be in the wedding"". I said that I had only asked him, & he said that he thought because John's girlfriend was included, that it meant the ask extended to his girlfriend as well. I said that I must not have explained it well & apologized, but that I only had room for him & not her. He told me then that he no longer wanted to be in the wedding as it meant his girlfriend would need to attend the wedding alone where she didn't know anyone, & I just said that I understood but was disappointed & he hung up. I talked to John later & he said he understood why Ben was confused, & asked if it would be worth it to find another person to be in the wedding to allow her to join. I talked to my fiance, & he also said he was fine with finding another person. My bridesmaids say that there's no reason she should have assumed that & it's not my responsibility to cater to her. I have not spoken to Ben since, he's ignored all my texts & I'm not sure if he's even coming as a guest or where we stand at all.

Now, I'm a bridesmaid short & Ben is mad that his girlfriend isn't included & has been talking about it with all our friends, causing drama amongst us.

Am I the Asshole?

I said that I had only asked him, & he said that he thought because John's girlfriend was included, that it meant the ask extended to his girlfriend as well. I said that I must not have explained it well & apologized, but that I only had room for him & not her. He told me then that he no longer wanted to be in the wedding as it meant his girlfriend would need to attend the wedding alone where she didn't know anyone, & I just said that I understood but was disappointed & he hung up. I talked to John later & he said he understood why Ben was confused, & asked if it would be worth it to find another person to be in the wedding to allow her to join. I talked to my fiance, & he also said he was fine with finding another person. My bridesmaids say that there's no reason she should have assumed that & it's not my responsibility to cater to her. I have not spoken to Ben since, he's ignored all my texts & I'm not sure if he's even coming as a guest or where we stand at all.

Now, I'm a bridesmaid short & Ben is mad that his girlfriend isn't included & has been talking about it with all our friends, causing drama amongst us.

Am I the Asshole?

My husband wants to live closer to the freeway for easy access for his work as he is a general contractor and drives far.

The draw back for my husband is my parents and my siblings have bought some of the lots already (we would be living in the same neighborhood as my family and my husband doesn’t want to do that) and it’s another 25 minute drive to the freeway. So my husband doesn’t want to buy one of the lots. I told him I would like to but I understand where he is coming from. I want to move into the subdivision with my family because it’s only another 20 minutes and we get 5 acres vs a quarter of an acre.

We quit playing for three months because I was tired of dealing with him. I offered to let anyone else run the game but no one stepped up. Recetly I was ready to start running a game again.

We did a one off last week. The player who we will call 'Adam' got upset because this time I didn't use the explosion in the cave they were in to open a hole to the surface like he though I should. After a long time of arguing I finally told him that the book I was pulling from said the ceiling caved in and didn't open a hole to the surface and that I'd rather go by the book than whatever he wants to have happen. I was then told that I'm not good with out of the box players and that I need to go with what the players want not what the book says. 

We are preparing for our next game. This one will take several months to play. Three of my six players requested a western so I agreed to adapt the book module to give things a western feel. Now 'Adam' is unhappy I am changing the book because he doesn't feel westerns and fantasy should mix.

117,1duw4u7,AITA for not visiting my grandmother?,"I live on a different continent than my extended family. This summer I had a chance to visit my home country, and I visited one set of grandparents, but not the other. I did not see my maternal grandparents. My mother is now telling me how horrible and inconsiderate I am, along with all sorts of other comments about my character. Familial obligation runs deep….

  
It‘s not that simple. First off I’m from a country where my job severely limits how much time off I can take. Fortunately my manager is decent human, so long as I get on-call coverage. But my team is small so it’s hard to get long trips covered. I don’t want to be the asshole that screws them over.

  
Other factors is that I grew up with the stories of how my grandmother was neglectful and emotionally abusive towards my mom. My grandmother admitted to some of the stories, but not all. I have no way of verifying any of the others, but it still doesn’t change the fact that I now have a certain view of my grandmother that isn’t positive. She’s also terrible to people - she’s been known to stalk tenants, she’s one of the judgy religious types, and she‘s berated caretakers so badly that they all quit.

  
I also see her once every 5-10 years, so it’s not like we’re close. Never have been.

  
Lastly, the only person who still checks in on my grandmother is a guy I have a romantic history with that I deeply regret because of how much it messed up his life. I thought I made it clear that I want to stay away from him. I’m glad he’s still in touch with my grandmother because it gives her something to look forward to, and we have someone whose opinion we trust giving us info on her actual state. He’s getting married to someone else this fall, and neither my mother nor my grandmother like his fiancée. One of them told him I would be in the country, he offered to show me around, and they passed along the invite to me despite my boundaries. To make that situation more complicated, when said romantic history happened, it was technically cheating on my part as I was with someone else at the time (who is now my spouse). We worked through that. My mother doesn’t like my spouse and has treated them like shit, so her passing along that invite was also disrespectful to my spouse. Like, I didn’t speak to my mom for 5 years because of that treatment and some other things.

  
My plan was to see my grandma next year once the guy is safely married and out of the picture, so to speak. I didn’t tell my mom that because I wasn’t sure I could make it work with my job. But now it’s this whole thing that  I saw one side of the family and “discarded” the other.

Never listening to me and makes random noises and borderline harassment . He was visiting for a few days. Friday through Sunday. And the moment he got into the car, I was agitated the whole weekend.

 My 46F mother always coddles him, makes excuses for him, and cuts and bend backwards for him. Everyone in my close family thinks I'm a bully for not wanting him around and it pisses me off.

For example, when I did something and he made a petty comments like telling that I talked too much and to stop talking. And when I got upset or snapped back, here comes the ""you're a meanie"" ""you're a horrible older cousin!"" 

It's annoying.

A few days ago, we went to Dave and Buster's. They didn't tell me and my mother told me to stop being an asshole and just enjoy being out. It was hot and sweaty in there. Not to mention we lived in the south and it's the summer time. 

She gave me a little card to go play with. Which I felt was petty but I let it go. I got quickly overstimulated and just sat at the same game, a small piano game.

My mother told me to stop being a jackass for not wanting to play games and hang out with him. And being rude and disrespectful to him. As if he wasn't banging and stomping around the house earlier.

I told her I was leaving the arcade and was going to sit down somewhere else. The arcade was connected to a mall. She scoffed and told me to go away. So I just bought a push pop and just sat down and ate it while watching YouTube. 

The rest of the day, in the mall, my cousin complained about being in girly stores and told us that he wants to leave and we did after I paid for my stuff, which he got tiny toys from by the way. 

When we got home, she called me an AH for rude and spoiled to him.Me leaving showed how spoiled I was as an only-child. And that it made him sad and it annoyed her. She brought up that he only wants to be my cousin. And that I'm treating him like dirt. 

I tried to say that I don't have to like him, and that she's been bending backwards for him since day one. And that he was a loud child who had no respect for others and she's only enabling it any letting him use my stuff which I don't want to be used and trampling over my thoughts opinions and boundaries

Around the same time my ex remarried her first husband Francis. They've known each since high school. The other day Tanner was babysitting Vincent and Francis was WFH. I guess Vincent asked if he could have a soda. Tanner said sure but they could share one.

Francis interjected and said it wasn't good idea to give soda to Vincent because he'll start asking for them. They were limiting his soda intake. Tanner said it was cool because they were sharing and it was a sugar free ginger ale. Francis said no.

That same night was Vincent's bath night and typically he likes to have someone in the bathroom with him so he cab talk to them (except his mom). So Tanner was in the bathroom with Vincent and talked about magic tricks. Francis walked by and said Vincent was too old to have bath supervision. Tanner said to go call me or my ex to see if they weren't fine with it.

Later Tanner told Francis not to tell him what he can or can't do. He doesn't work for Francis. If he has an issue then take it up me or my ex. Francis said it was his house so he does have a say and implied that he could fire him.

Tanner related this to me and my ex and we both agreed that Tanner worked for us, not Francis and Francis should take up it up with us unless Tanner was taking Vincent skydiving.

I apologized to Tanner for what happened. Later Francis apologized too and said he had a lot noise in his head and too it out on him and Vincent.

I asked my ex if she apologized too. She asked why would she apologize? I said for what he went through. She said she fixed it and wasn't going to apologize. I said no, you didn't fix it. All you're doing is making him feel like you are annoyed with him or he's not appreciated. It's Ike not saying thanks for going above and beyond.",Asshole,2024-07-04,"AITA for telling my son's mom to apologize to our sitter? My ex wife and I share custody of our 8yo son Vincent.

121,1duvgc7,AITA for not seeing my partner after him being on holiday for a month,I 24 F and he 28 M have been in a relationship for a year and a half. My partner was taken on an all expenses paid trip over to Europe with family for a family holiday. I was invited but declined due to not being able to take a month off work. I had been asking for return dates since he went away and he either forgot to ask his mum for the dates or was given the dates and forgot to tell me. I then sent his mum a message and she gave me a date of when they would be coming back which was on a Tuesday (9th) so I wouldn’t be able to see him till that weekend as we live an hour and a half away from each other. On the last week of him being overseas he told me his return date (3rd and a Saturday) which had changed from what I had been told originally. I had made plans to house sit for a friend that weekend as I thought I wouldn’t have to travel to see him. When I was told of the new dates i informed him I wouldn’t be able to see him due to other commitments and he spat it and then went ghost on me.

122,1duvcfx,AITA for watching a show my gf likes weekly without her since she doesn't like to watch weekly but rather wait for it to fully come out?,"I (M31) basically watched a season of a show on my own weekly, I told my gf (26) when the first episode came out and told her hey this show you love has a new season coming out today, I'm already watching the first episode, it's an anime show as well, worth of mention because I don't mind watching with subtitles and Japanese audio while she has mentioned that she prefers to wait for the English dub, we talked a little bit about it and there might have been some miscommunication because she thinks we agreed to wait for it to come out and watch it together and I didn't think anything of the sort was in the plans. So I watched some episodes every now and again, I didn't watch the whole thing because it wasn't something that I was eagerly waiting for every week to be honest I just wanted to know more about something that she liked.

The point is that today that the dub is fully completed I asked her if she wanted to watch it together and as we were about to watch it I mentioned oh yea I've watched a few episodes while it was coming out weekly, then she got upset because she loves this show and wanted it to be ""our"" show, I don't love it but don't hate it either, I watch it because she loves it and wanted to share some time of our night together watching it, might as well say that I'm the kind of person who keeps up with this kind of stuff weekly, I rewatch quite a few shows and always keep an eye on new releases for anything interesting coming out, she doesn't watch much movies, shows or anything like that, but she has mentioned to me that she doesn't like the weekly watch and the suspense of it so she waits for full seasons to come out and also sometimes is hard for her to keep up with what's going on in the screen and read subtitles at the same time so I thought I might as well wait for it to fully come out dubbed so we can watch it together, rewatching something is a very normal thing for me.

She says that the first watch of it is gone and it wouldn't be as special if I was rewatching it so she doesn't wanna watch it with me anymore and says that she'll just watch it in her own time at some point.

123,1duv7u8,AITA for not being okay with my BF behavior ,"So on 30th June my boyfriend(27M) had an exam and him and I(27F) planned the movie date after his exam a week ago and I gave him the space to study for his exam and was really looking forward to our date. (We are in a long distance relationship)

On 28th, he told me there's a new movie being released and he wants to watch it and I simply said he should if he wants to. He was booking the tickets and the date was showing 28th. Then on 29th, I confirmed with him about the date and he said yeah. I have been patiently waiting for him to finish his exam and when he did, he called me for a little while and asked me to give him 5 minutes. I waited for him to call me back for almost 2 hours. When he came back and I asked him he told me he was booking the tickets to watch the movie he was looking forward to. I got upset because this is the 4th raincheck he gave me. I've been looking forward to spend some time with him after his exam and he simply cancelled the date we planned for a week to watch a movie which was released on 27th (Whenever he has friends coming over or anything he would just cancel our date which we would be planning for weeks for just a sudden thing.) 

It's 4th June now and I have been giving him the cold shoulder, not because I'm angry but because I'm simply hurt he's not considerate about my feelings. No matter how many times I've told him i dislike such stuff he keeps on doing it. It's like he doesn't care about me and my feelings at all. 

He messaged me a moment ago telling me he misses me and I told him I miss him too. He called me a liar and said I don't care lesss.. no calls, no texts, no shit. I asked him if he wants to be reminded of why. And he asked how long am I gonna punish him for that.. I simply told him that I'm not punishing nor I'm angry at him he goes like, ""Man, nobody can argue  with you. Once you choose to do something, I can’t convince you to do otherwise. Chill, lose the stubborn and aggressive attitude"" I told him I'm chill and he's like,"" cool whatever you say"" and said nothing after that.
