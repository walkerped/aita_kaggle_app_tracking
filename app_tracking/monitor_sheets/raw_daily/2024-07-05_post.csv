0,1dvt5ng,AITA For Finally Standing Up For Myself Towards My Own Friend?,"I need to know if I am the asshole for finally standing up for myself against my own friend. I (FTM/16) met my friend Ethan (M/16) in late 7th Grade and have been friends with until recently in high school. We hit it off very quickly. However, when it came to finishing middle school and going to high school, our school took all the 8th graders to Hawai'i as a promotion gift. I never went since I didn't have to money for it but Ethan and many of my own friends went and had an amazing time as I heard. Few months later, we are Freshmen in high school, I have gotten a partner.Yet, when I told my friends they all said that they thought Ethan and I were dating since Ethan mentioned to everyone on the Hawaiian Trip that we have been dating. I was completely shocked and confused because I was dating my current partner at the time but I said that I have never in my life date him. Which I brushed off since I thought it was just a rumor someone else started. A month later, I heard from my close friends that Ethan has been talking shit about me being gay and transgender. I do understand not everyone supports it, but it confused me since he was also gay for having a secret boyfriend. I did not want to start a scene and upset anyone so again I ignored it and ghosted him. Not even two days later, he blew up on my for ""ignoring him and being a selfish asshole who only cares about themselves"" all because I ignored him? At that point I finally was tired of it and snapped back, saying that he made rumors of us being together and making fun of me for own sexuality and gender and just being a complete asshole for months. He was silent then started denying everything I said while saying that I making up shit and calling me ""retarded"" for even mentioning this to him. After this I told him not to talk to me and I cut him off for weeks. I felt so much better without him in my life for those weeks until he complained to my own friends. He told them to convince me to talk to him and talk everything out. Which I agreed to and met up to talk things out saying that his guy group put him up to everything and was deeply sorry for everything he said because he had emotional since his grandmother had died. I forgave him and comforted him. However, Another month later, everything started up again, and the same fight happened again but with him bring up everything wrong with my life and that I never cared about him or anyone ever in my life. Which again I snapped back and told him to fuck off and left. This fight and forgiving situation happened about 2 or 3 more times, I am mentally and physically exhausted to argue or even fight about anything with him. He only uses the excuse of his grandparents dying or blaming it on his own friends which also hated me to a pretty bad degree. I have not talked to him since the end of Freshmen Year.

Come Tuesday I got to see the baby and he and his wife brutally rip into me about not having come the same day. 

I understand that he had expectations and was upset, but he never made me aware of that and continually made me feel like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and gave me a pass. Am I in the wrong for not having ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù?

4,1dvlbuq,AITA for not responding to my sister texts about their boyfriend?,"
My twin sister (22) has recently open up to me about her relationship with a 48 year old man. Some background information is she is mentally handicapped and in an assisted living care. She has Schizophrenia and is autistic. 
   
         Today when I got off work she texted me don't freak out but I'm dating! I asked why would I freak out she then tells me that she is talking to a 48 year old. What's going through my mind is what does a 48 year old wants to do with a 22 year old? I then ask when they've met and if he knows her condition. THEY'VE BEEN TALKING SINCE SHE WAS 16. I tell her it's not normal and I'm concerned. She says that he loves her,  that he's nothing but green flags and that I'm not understanding. He stopped talking to her until she was 18 and before when she was 16, it wasn't anything sexual. I tell her that any adult should not feel comfortable talking to an 16 year old unless they are their parent or its their job. I try to explain that even if he waited until she was 18 to talk to her, he should have blocked her and never contacted her again. She kept going on and on about how I was wrong and her therapist is an experienced and is educated on what grooming is and says their relationship is okay. Her therapist knows everything about the relationship and says they are nothing but green flags. How can a therapist say this is okay. I love my sister but she's getting so angry about it. So I decided if I keep giving it negative attention she's going to get closer to him. The group home has to see everyone that checked her out so she will be safe and if she's not back in time they'll call the cops. This is the text I sent her 
        ""I love you and I really just want to say I'm not okay with this relationship you have, I believe he had groomed you. 
I will not encourage or support this relationship. It's not normal that he is 48, it's not normal that he talked to you at 16 then waited til you were legal to contact you again. I will not be responding to anymore texts about him. I love you and I want what is best for you"" 
         She then defends it for 30 or ao texts it was hard not to respond I'm nervous for her. 
She's convinced it's okay and that her therapist is okay with it. Her group home is okay with it. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone how is everyone okay with this? I feel like a horrible person for not responding especially because she was excited to tell me about her dating and everyone seems to think it's okay.

7,1dwbe01,AITA If I call the police for on my new neighbors?,"So, two weeks ago I moved closer to my parents as they are getting old and could use a hand around the house. When I really got settled in last week I went to my neighbors and introduced my self. My left sided neighbors were super nice and polite. They are a young couple (Eva and Drew) i‚Äôd say lates 20s. They invited me in and we had lemonade and chatted for a little. It was very pleasant. 

During our conversation Eva mentioned my neighbors to the right of my house. She explained that on the weekends this large group of people tend to have get togethers in their backyard. Recently due to a series of noise complaints they have moved the gatherings in doors. 

From what I was told last spring a person had gone missing and was last seen going to one of these parties. After this the parties stopped for a little while before picking back up again after a month or so.

When the three of us finished our lemonade and conversation I left and decided to go back home instead of going to my other neighbors house. Though when I got home I looked out of my second floor window out at their yard. It had two layers of gates, multiple security cameras, barred windows, and a large cage(For a large dog I assume. Granted, I have never seen a dog). 

A day later (last friday) A letter was slipped through the mail slot on my front door. It read along the lines of ‚ÄúPlease feel free to join us for a couple drinks at one of my parties.‚Äù I considered it but decided against my curiosity.

When it grew dark the noise grew loud. It was like a concert was going on in my backyard. I got up to look out the window and my neighbors lights were off. The whole place was dark. It was clearly coming from their home yet it seemed empty.

I decided to go over and ask if they‚Äôd turn it down. When I knocked on the door no one came to the door. I stood knocking and ringing the door bell for maybe five minutes before giving up and calling 911. I watched from my second floor window as a patrol car came knocked and finally someone got to the door. 

It was an older gentleman who looked very unhappy.  As he spoke to the police he kept looking at my house. I really do think he knew it was me. After speaking with the officers he went back inside and the music was turned completely off.

The following night these exact events followed. It grew dark, music blared, I knocked to no avail, and the police handled the issue. The next night it was silent. It has been so ever since.

But, today I have seen several people enter my neighbors house parking in front of my home which wasn‚Äôt an issue last time. I fear tonight is going to be a repeat of not far worse. AITA if I call the police again?

EDIT: I looked it up and thankfully my town encourages residents to use 911 as apposed to a nonemergency number 

EDIT 2: They are back at it tonight just with no music. It seems though that they are still throwing a party. I have now noticed that there is a light coming from the basement.

During our conversation Eva mentioned my neighbors to the right of my house. She explained that on the weekends this large group of people tend to have get togethers in their backyard. Recently due to a series of noise complaints they have moved the gatherings in doors. 

From what I was told last spring a person had gone missing and was last seen going to one of these parties. After this the parties stopped for a little while before picking back up again after a month or so.

When the three of us finished our lemonade and conversation I left and decided to go back home instead of going to my other neighbors house. Though when I got home I looked out of my second floor window out at their yard. It had two layers of gates, multiple security cameras, barred windows, and a large cage(For a large dog I assume. Granted, I have never seen a dog). 

A day later (last friday) A letter was slipped through the mail slot on my front door. It read along the lines of ‚ÄúPlease feel free to join us for a couple drinks at one of my parties.‚Äù I considered it but decided against my curiosity.

When it grew dark the noise grew loud. It was like a concert was going on in my backyard. I got up to look out the window and my neighbors lights were off. The whole place was dark. It was clearly coming from their home yet it seemed empty.

I decided to go over and ask if they‚Äôd turn it down. When I knocked on the door no one came to the door. I stood knocking and ringing the door bell for maybe five minutes before giving up and calling 911. I watched from my second floor window as a patrol car came knocked and finally someone got to the door. 

It was an older gentleman who looked very unhappy.  As he spoke to the police he kept looking at my house. I really do think he knew it was me. After speaking with the officers he went back inside and the music was turned completely off.

The following night these exact events followed. It grew dark, music blared, I knocked to no avail, and the police handled the issue. The next night it was silent. It has been so ever since.

But, today I have seen several people enter my neighbors house parking in front of my home which wasn‚Äôt an issue last time. I fear tonight is going to be a repeat of not far worse. AITA if I call the police again?

EDIT: I looked it up and thankfully my town encourages residents to use 911 as apposed to a nonemergency number 

EDIT 2: They are back at it tonight just with no music. It seems though that they are still throwing a party. I have now noticed that there is a light coming from the basement. I will be ordering cameras in the AM!",0.0,0.5710073709487915,1,0
8,1dwartd,WIBTA for wearing ear defenders on my family‚Äôs vacation.,"I (18f) have autism spectrum disorder which causes me to have sensory sensitivities. It‚Äôs very difficult for me to be in loud environments without experiencing shutdowns or meltdowns. I can sometimes hold in these reactions but it just causes larger shutdowns/meltdowns later on.

I can wear them in malls, school, in lobbies, museums, etc. But not usually outdoor spaces like parks or pools. I can‚Äôt wear them in photos either. My parents are generally pretty understanding but my siblings are embarrassed by me wearing them.

In a few weeks, my family is going on a vacation where we‚Äôll be going to Universal Studios and Disney. We‚Äôll be there for several days and will visit each individual park. Much of these parks are outdoors but are still very crowded.

I want to still wear my ear defenders just in case the environment is overstimulating. I will take them off if it‚Äôs not and I won‚Äôt wear them in pictures.

We are going more budget friendly getting married at the little white chapel, and not having an actual reception/party after, we‚Äôre paying for everyone‚Äôs dinner at a nice buffet so there‚Äôs something for everyone.

Our family lives all over the place so there isn‚Äôt really a central location to have a wedding that‚Äôs ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù for everyone, and we‚Äôve both talked about having a Vegas wedding since we met.

13,1dw9zrq,AITA for the comment I made to my boyfriend during a movie? ,"This is an old disagreement from a few months ago when the Mummy (beloved 90s action flick) got a theater re-release. 


Me, my boyfriend, and two of my friends made plans to see it. He mentioned he hadn't seen the film since he was really little and that he hated those scenes where the scarab burrowed under people's skin. I agreed (I also didn't love watching those scenes) but we ended up making plans to go. He seemed reluctant - he's not much of a movie watcher - but he could see how excited I was and decided to come with.


During the film I squeeze his leg during jokes now and then and occasionally go ""oooooo"" during scary/ominous scenes. Eventually it becomes obvious the scarab scene is coming up, there's spooky music and such, so whisper ""ooo, i got you babe,"" and squeeze his hand. He just sort of side-eyes me and withdraws his hand. 


For the rest of the film he doesn't respond to any little kisses and his hand just goes dead limp if I try to hold it. I assume he's really not enjoying the movie and let him be. When we say our goodbyes to leave, he doesn't say much at all, doesn't speak during the car ride home, and once we get back he goes directly to his room and shuts the door. I spend some time crying confused and upset that he had a bad night. After a while I knock and crack open his door to talk.


 He told me my comment (""I got you babe"") felt like I was calling him a coward, and making fun of him for being scared of the scarab scene as a kid, and mocking him by holding his hand through it.


 I apologized profusely, and by the next day things were back to normal. Secretly, I'm still upset. I see how my comment could be hurtful in that context, but I also feel like he took it in the absolute worst possible way and unnecessarily attached vitriol to my words that wasn't actually there. Further, I feel like he ""punished"" me for the rest of the night by withdrawing, not speaking to me or my friends, and shutting himself in, which really stings. Every once in a while if he is a little snippy or dismissive it reminds me of that night, and I feel like I'm holding onto unresolved anger about it.

AITA for my comment? Was it actually derisive? Or should I talk to him about his response (which in my opinion was overboard)?

EDIT: I wanted to add that my ""got you babe"" comment was genuinely meant to be supportive. I didn't want to be so serious as to ask ""hey it's coming up are you gonna be OK"" but I also thought it would be nice to hold hands

They bought this house about 12 years ago and I‚Äôve lived here the whole time. Maybe 3 years leading up to my stepdad‚Äôs death, my mom and I never talked cause all she wanted to do was listen to audio books and scroll through facebook. After my stepdad passed it felt like we were getting closer and things were happier. She realized that I was right about my stepdad being mentally abusive but then acted like it only happened to her even though I was the main target since she was never home. She even told me that she only married him so that she had someone to take care of me and my brother and that by picking him, she was just taking a shot in the dark. She met this guy, Let‚Äôs call him Tim, around her age in the beginning of 2023 about a month after the funeral. Tim moved in about 2 weeks after they met and it was fine until they started screaming at each other and he would come to the house drunk and even moved in his three kids (one wasn‚Äôt actually legitimately his) from a baby mama. Tim then convinced my mom to let his brother stay here for a bit after getting out of jail on bond. He never told us about the brothers past and completely lied to everyone why his brother was in jail. Turns out he was also abusive! Anyways, my mom keeps letting people from Tim‚Äôs family come over and not telling me anything about these strangers coming over including the brother staying with us. So we don‚Äôt find out about the brothers past until after Tim gets arrested for trying to hurt my mom in front of me while drunk in the house.

Tim and his various family members don‚Äôt come over anymore after he got arrested but she is still dating him.

24,1dw8ea4,WIBTA if I told my friend that I can‚Äôt watch her dog anymore?,"Hi,

A few weeks ago, I agreed to watch my friend‚Äôs (male) dog next week for about 5 days. I live in a house with my BF, SIL, (female) dog, and cat. Our backyard has some gaps in the fence and we rent so there‚Äôs nothing we can do. She‚Äôs also aware of this and didn‚Äôt have any issue w it. We had the dogs meet in a neutral place and they seemed to tolerate each other (my dog is a bit old and grumpy). She talks about how her dog has perfect recall, doesn‚Äôt run away, and is very chill + low maintenance. 

After this, she asked us if we could watch her dog for the night bc her friend is in town. I agreed, on the condition that the next day, she comes to let my dog out while we‚Äôre out of the house. She agrees to come first thing in the morning and just hang at my house with both dogs for the day. She drops off her dog and 15 min after she leaves, we let her dog out. My BF and I are both outside w him but he‚Äôs inching toward the edge of the yard. We try to get him to come back inside and he just busts out. We both chase him and he runs into a neighbor‚Äôs yards and is gone. I call my friend to let her and ask for her help to get him. She and her friend arrive and we wander around the neighborhood with no luck. My friend admits that he actually has run away before. We return to my house after a couple of hours of looking and her dog comes back to our yard! My friend leaves and we watch him for the night. 

The next morning, she lets me know that she‚Äôs hungover and her friend‚Äôs gonna come by to get the dog from us, and she‚Äôll let our dog out later. However, she then calls and asks us to drop her dog off to her apt instead, which we do. She never comes by to take our dog out, procrastinating until we decide to come home. 

2 days ago, she asks me to watch her dog again, this time, only for 3 hours on 4th of July night while she goes to a show with her BF. She now lets me know that her dog cannot be left alone for even 30 min or he might destroy her apt. I agree since she promises to get him at around 1am, but let her know I‚Äôll be asleep and my BF has to work early. They come over beforehand for dinner and find out the show is canceled, but want to go out anyways. They promise to come back even earlier than intended. I get a text at 12:30am saying she‚Äôs getting ready to come get her dog. An hour later, she says she‚Äôs too drunk and will just come at 7am instead offering me $80. I don‚Äôt sleep all night bc her dog is crying from fireworks. At 6:45am, she texts that she‚Äôs up, but is going back to sleep and I should text her when I‚Äôm up. I text her 30 min later saying to get her dog and I have a vet appt at 9am, but she‚Äôs on DND. At 9am, I text her saying I pushed the vet appt but she needs to get her dog ASAP and hit ‚ÄúNotify anyways‚Äù. She comes and gets her dog within 30 min. 

WIBTA for not wanting to watch her dog next week? She has proven 2/2 times that she‚Äôs not reliable to pick up her dog.

A few weeks ago, I agreed to watch my friend‚Äôs (male) dog next week for about 5 days. I live in a house with my BF, SIL, (female) dog, and cat. Our backyard has some gaps in the fence and we rent so there‚Äôs nothing we can do. She‚Äôs also aware of this and didn‚Äôt have any issue w it. We had the dogs meet in a neutral place and they seemed to tolerate each other (my dog is a bit old and grumpy). She talks about how her dog has perfect recall, doesn‚Äôt run away, and is very chill + low maintenance. 

After this, she asked us if we could watch her dog for the night bc her friend is in town. I agreed, on the condition that the next day, she comes to let my dog out while we‚Äôre out of the house. She agrees to come first thing in the morning and just hang at my house with both dogs for the day. She drops off her dog and 15 min after she leaves, we let her dog out. My BF and I are both outside w him but he‚Äôs inching toward the edge of the yard. We try to get him to come back inside and he just busts out. We both chase him and he runs into a neighbor‚Äôs yards and is gone. I call my friend to let her and ask for her help to get him. She and her friend arrive and we wander around the neighborhood with no luck. My friend admits that he actually has run away before. We return to my house after a couple of hours of looking and her dog comes back to our yard! My friend leaves and we watch him for the night. 

The next morning, she lets me know that she‚Äôs hungover and her friend‚Äôs gonna come by to get the dog from us, and she‚Äôll let our dog out later. However, she then calls and asks us to drop her dog off to her apt instead, which we do. She never comes by to take our dog out, procrastinating until we decide to come home. 

2 days ago, she asks me to watch her dog again, this time, only for 3 hours on 4th of July night while she goes to a show with her BF. She now lets me know that her dog cannot be left alone for even 30 min or he might destroy her apt. I agree since she promises to get him at around 1am, but let her know I‚Äôll be asleep and my BF has to work early. They come over beforehand for dinner and find out the show is canceled, but want to go out anyways. They promise to come back even earlier than intended. I get a text at 12:30am saying she‚Äôs getting ready to come get her dog. An hour later, she says she‚Äôs too drunk and will just come at 7am instead offering me $80. I don‚Äôt sleep all night bc her dog is crying from fireworks. At 6:45am, she texts that she‚Äôs up, but is going back to sleep and I should text her when I‚Äôm up. I text her 30 min later saying to get her dog and I have a vet appt at 9am, but she‚Äôs on DND. At 9am, I text her saying I pushed the vet appt but she needs to get her dog ASAP and hit ‚ÄúNotify anyways‚Äù. She comes and gets her dog within 30 min.

25,1dw8d1b,AITA for lecturing my 18 yo brother on hygiene?,"I (F16) have had countless conversations with my brother (M18) about his lack of hygiene. it has resulted in arguments, yelling, name calling and threats.

for context, my brother has had mental health issues for many years, meaning getting up and showering etc has always been difficult. i understood this for many years and offered him the help i could, he is now out of therapy, healing and much much MUCH better. i understand depression doesn‚Äôt disappear but he is not in depressive episodes at the moment. 

my brothers lack of hygiene has been something that always embarrassed me. it keeps me from having friends up to my house. he reeks from not showering for days on, up to 2 weeks sometimes, his fingernails are so long that they snap easily, hurt people and collect dirt, his toenails have caused him foot pain from how long they are, i dislike holding conversations with him without distance because of his breath, and much more. 

while i understand this can be a struggle to keep up with, i usually start with a reminder. ‚Äòi‚Äôm going for a shower, would you like to go first?‚Äô sometimes, i‚Äôm much more blunt, and will tell him his nails are too long and need to be cut, etc. i am not trying to bring him down but we are a house brought up on honesty, if you smell bad, we offer deodorant.

while i know this should be my parents place, they are yet to take it upon themselves, which leaves me the option of lecturing him. i sat him down and told him his lack of hygiene will be the reason someone passes a comment he can‚Äôt handle, or people won‚Äôt want to hang around with him. i was called a bitch and arrogant, i don‚Äôt think wanting a sibling to be clean his arrogance. i usually am the one cleaning his room and up after him, it‚Äôs embarrassing and tiring. when i told him my reasons further, he told me to stop antagonizing him and i was told to just leave him be.

i really don‚Äôt want to clean up underwear with skid marks anymore, i don‚Äôt want my brother to be picked on and i don‚Äôt like living with someone who doesn‚Äôt take care of themselves.  i really just want to know if i‚Äôm the asshole for addressing this?

28,1dw7cbj,AITA for constantly being rude to my parent:v,"I (f16) am the middle child of 5 and my sister (f9) is basically my responsibility, aside from taking her to school and such

My mother is usually in bed & my step dad is always in the garage and IRRATIONALLY angry.  They are both very neglectful (and drink. WAY too often. & my dad is baked out his MIND half the time) & rely on me and my nana to cook for everyone, clean & get groceries

Whilst I do have lots of time to do things I enjoy, a lot of my time is dedicated towards my sister. Before school, I spend my morning making sure shes ready, eaten, gotten into her uniform and i do her hair. When she‚Äôs home it‚Äôs mostly my responsibility to make sure she does something other than watch tv all day, does her night routine, eats & then I read her a story every night. Weekends are a whole lot more difficult with making her breakfast/lunch & making sure shes entertained (usually by me) for the entire day. 

Aside from just the physical small tasks, I am a strong advocate for gentle parenting, something she doesn‚Äôt receive from anyone but me. Even still i teach her basic hygiene she SHOULD have been taught by now like showering, brushing her teeth everyday & everything else. I also talk her through dealing with conflict, insecurities, sadness etc. I have taught her about boundaries (both hers and respecting others), positive affirmations, emotional regulation & everything else she SHOULD already know. No matter what goes on, I am the one who advocates for her & makes sure shes included, even to the extent of definitely pissing people off from my nagging.

When she has a problem, she comes to me. If its a nightmare, a problem at school or shes crying because she washed the cat with hand soap and he was licking himself dry, I am the one she comes to. When my nana (who lives with us) finds a problem, she asks me ‚Äòcan you have a talk with her about [‚Ä¶]‚Äô as its well known to be my responsibility 

Now. Whilst im certainly GLAD that i can be that for her, it‚Äôs incredibly taxxing. I don‚Äôt enjoy just mindlessly complaining about my issues but when it comes to my parents, it seems i have no patience.

The other day i asked my mother if she had anything specific she wanted for dinner, and she replied with ‚ÄòWell from being at work all day to cleaning the house, i havent had the time to think about food.‚Äô

To this, I kinda just. laughed in her face and said ‚Äòarent you a warrior‚Äô . admittedly, VERY childish and QUITR unnecessary

She looked up at me and looked really hurt and went to argue with me but i . turned around and walked away. and now shes been mostly ignoring me for the past 5ish days.

33,1dw6lr6,AITA for Not Letting My Friends Light Possibly Illegal Fireworks at My House?,"I recently hosted a small 4th of July party at my house. A few days before the party, my friends T and J mentioned they wanted to make the event special and said they would bring a few fireworks, but didn‚Äôt give me any details. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time.

Fast forward to the day of the party, T and J show up with a huge box of fireworks that were definitely illegal. Apparently, they spent $200 on these fireworks without telling me beforehand.

I immediately felt uneasy. I live in a quiet neighborhood with families and kids, and we have strict rules about fireworks. I told T and J that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable setting off illegal fireworks at my house because I didn‚Äôt want to risk getting fined or worse. They got really upset, saying they‚Äôd already spent the money and that I was being overly cautious.

They argued that it was just for fun and that nothing would go wrong, but I stood my ground and said no. The tension was palpable for the rest of the evening, and it definitely put a damper on the party mood.

Now, some of our mutual friends are saying I overreacted and that I should have just let them do it for the sake of the party. I feel bad that they wasted their money and that the night wasn‚Äôt as fun as they hoped, but I also didn‚Äôt want to risk the potential consequences.

34,1dw5t4i,AITAH for telling my best friend her boyfriend lied to her,"I 28 F, have a best friend (Sarah 28F), and she has a boyfriend (Luke 29M), they met three months ago and started dating

I met him twice so far, and the last time, Sarah and Luke gave me a ride home, so we talked a lot in the car about personal stuff, wich was fun

Three weeks ago, Luked texted me asking for advice, he wanted to get Sarah a birthday present and asked me for gift ideas that she would like. I told him she loooooveeeees gucci bags, and that she would be so pleased if he got him one,  
I sent him photos of the two black bags she already has from gucci, and a photo of the one she would like the most  
  
He told me he never even heard of the brand, thanked me for giving him the idea and later he went to the store, he sent me photos of all the bags available and we picked one, wich he baught

A week ago, he called me asking for advice, because of some issues he's been having with Sarah, he told me he is a little unsure about their future together and told me many things Sarah did in the relationship he didn't like and asked me for advice on how to approach the issues with her so they can resolve them  
He also said he is calling me because he doesn't really have any close friends and that he enjoyed talking to me the other night  
I adviced him to just be honest with Sarah, that she values honesty above all and that he should just talk to her  
After I hung up I felt weird about the call, I didn't like that he called me and regreted that I didn't tell him that I think it's inappropriate  
But I never told Sarah about the call  
  
 Today is Sarahs birthday, she called me today all exited telling me she's so in love with Luke because he is the sweetest most attentive guy she ever met. She told me he arrived at midnight at her house with a big gucci box and that she was shocked he guessed she loved those brand bags because she never mentioned him anything about those bags  
  
She told me she was so grateful to him and that later she asked him how he knew that's what she loved so much, she asked him if her mom or I, her best friend, helped him, and he said no, that we didn't help him.  
  
He said he noticed her wearing those two bags she already had, and that one time she left her bag in his car so he took a picture of the bag and brand, and googled it, so that how he found the store and model she liked

She told me that she is so impressed and that she never imagined someone would pay her that much attention to be capable of investigating what she liked and so on

So I told her that he is so sweet for caring for her but that I was the one to tell him that she liked those bags and wich ones she already had, because he didn¬¥t even know the brand name

Now she is bummed and sad that he lied to her for such an insignificant thing, and it's my fault she is sad because I told her the truth

Now cut to this afternoon, I am talking again with my mom and she starts talking about the dress color again, saying she‚Äôs very confused with the color I‚Äôm asking her to find. I told her again that I thought any red-hue color would be perfectly fine, it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. She then told me that she really liked the dress she showed me earlier with the white because it broke up the dress.

She came back telling me that it‚Äôs okay to wear white as long as it‚Äôs not a lot, like a white shirt with a skirt would be okay - I told her again that I would prefer that she didn‚Äôt wear white.

She is now upset with me and being very passive aggressive. Am I the asshole for not wanting her to wear white? Even if it‚Äôs just the top of the dress? I feel like there are thousands of red dresses online to choose from, it shouldn‚Äôt be hard to find one that is red and doesn‚Äôt make you look like a period stain.

37,1dw4cgr,AITA for not caring that my son's feelings are hurt and not consoling him?,"I'm a 34-year-old male, married to my wife, a 32-year-old female, for just over two years. We've been together for six years and have a great life together. My wife has a 13-year-old son from a previous relationship who lives with us, and I've been in his life since he was eight.

I have had dreadlocks for the past 15 years, and naturally, my son wanted to emulate me by getting locks of his own, which he's had for five years. Although I strive to be a good father, my son is very spoiled. Whenever I try to instill some discipline, I face resistance from him, his mother, and his grandparents. As a result, I've resigned myself to giving him what he wants, figuring there's no point in trying to discipline him if no one else supports it. He's not a disrespectful child, but he's not as respectful as he could be and is very spoiled.

Recently, some kids at his school have been bullying him about his hair, trying to convince him to cut it. His grandfather had already told him not to let the kids bully him into cutting his hair. One day, while we were around some of his friends, he expressed a desire to cut his locks. I reminded him of his grandfather's words and told him he couldn't cut it. In front of his friends, he called his grandmother, asked if he could cut his hair, and she said yes. He then looked at me and said, ""I bet I cut my hair."" I responded that we had spent too much money on his hair and he shouldn't let anyone bully him into cutting it.

A week later, my wife asked me again if our son could cut his hair. Frustrated, I said it was his hair and he could do whatever he wanted, but reminded her that his grandfather had said no. Ultimately, he got his hair cut. As you can guess, he now regrets it and wants to reattach his locks. My wife told me about his frustration, but I feel no sympathy because I warned him he wouldn't like it, yet he did it anyway. 

Here's why I think I might be the AH. My wife expressed that I need to be more comforting to him and sensitive to his feelings because this is a hard lesson for him.

So for months he‚Äôs been battling trying to stay sober. 
So back to when I quit for 4 months 
He didn‚Äôt stay sober one bit. Drank almost every night 
Multiple beers a night. 
So one night I asked if I could smoke

He‚Äôs made the agreement to quit drinking ONLY if I quit smoking 
He spends $140 bucks every 2 weeks on beer. 
Where as I only spend $18 every 2 weeks on dab. 


Am I the asshole for not wanting to quit and telling him to grow up and be sober for me and the family? 
Would I be an asshole to continue to keep smoking while I told him he can‚Äôt drink? 

I feel he is asking me for something he wouldn‚Äôt even do himself 
I quit already for 4 months and not once did he ever stay sober 
Now all of a sudden he wants to stay sober but he‚Äôs not if I‚Äôm sober 
I just think it‚Äôs a cop out 
And I never did that to him when I quit smoking 
I just quit and I didn‚Äôt focus on other people

I don't hold this against her -- I understand that people with different temperaments have different thresholds for messiness. When my wife's messes are confined to her own spaces, I ignore them. And even when she leaves messes in our shared spaces, I clean them up myself. I'm happy to do the bulk of the cleaning, since my wife cooks our meals and takes care of our dog, for which I'm very grateful.

But recently, she started getting angry whenever I did her laundry, since I would put her newly washed and folded clothes in the wrong drawers. (I wash and fold all the laundry myself.) So, at her request, I started leaving her clothes folded on the top of her dresser instead. However, she often went several days without putting them away. When this happened, I would put them away myself. This made her angry. So, we reached a compromise: I would wait two days before touching her clothes after folding them, so that she would have a chance to put them away herself.

Yesterday, I put her clothes away, since she had left them on top of her dresser for three days. This morning, she had trouble finding one of her shirts, because I put it in the wrong drawer. So, she cussed me out. 

In response, I told her to pound sand. I said that if she wanted her clothes in the right drawers, she would have to put them there herself within a day. She accused me of being tyrannical, manipulative, and unwilling to compromise. I replied that I'd already compromised and that she could resolve this problem simply by putting her own clothes away. As I was typing this paragraph, she texted me threatening to withhold you-know-what. Once again, I told her to pound sand.

My wife isn't an unreasonable person in general, and the fact that a generally reasonable person thinks I'm an a-hole is *pro tanto* evidence that I am one. I also often worry that I'm too type-A for my own good, even though I try not to foist my clean-freakiness on my wife.

I am from Arizona and went to school in San Diego, so we rented a U-HAUL to drive it from az-san diego (along with some other stuff). 

At the end of my junior year, I was moving to a new place for my senior year. The new place was furnished so I needed to get rid of all my furniture. My dad did not want me to get rid of the dresser so i knew i needed to get it home somehow. My roommate at the time said she would use it for the year since she was moving into an unfurnished place. I asked my dad and he said that was great so that we didn‚Äôt have to drive it home, and we would deal with it after we graduate the following year. so, my roommate took the dresser for the year- awesome. 

Now it is the end of the year and the roommate that took my dresser is moving out. She asked me what she should do with the dresser and so I asked my dad (since it‚Äôs his). he said that she needs to get the dresser back to us in arizona- this would require her to rent a u-haul and drive from san diego to arizona just to return our dresser, then drive back. 

I said that was ridiculous to make her do that because in my mind, her taking the dresser allowed us to not have to bring it back the past year, hence doing us a favor. I argued that it‚Äôs up to us to go get it- i believe it‚Äôs mainly up to him but i would also go get it with him since he did let me use it for the year.

46,1dw2i6g,AITA for refusing to use the fridge and having two of my own?,"I (F21) live in a college apartment that houses 4. We all have bedrooms, but we share a living room and kitchen space. I moved in with one friend, but the other two girls seemed pretty nice. 

Quickly into the year, I noticed the fridge getting crowded and starting to smell. I shot a text to our group chat that the fridge was too full and there was some rotting food, so I asked if everyone could double check and make sure none of it was theirs. They all agreed, but over the next few days, it didn't get better. My friend removed what was hers, but there was still a lot of rotting food and some sticky stuff forming.

At Christmas break, everyone went home, while I stayed (I had to work). I finally decided that I was going to clean the entire fridge, and warned the chat that I was throwing out anything rotten or expired. They said they were fine with that, and about 95% of the food in there was unusable.

It took close to five hours to finish, plus the dumpster was down four stories. I took pictures of rotten meats, moldy leftovers, and liquefied vegetables. It was a disgusting experience, and I even ran some of the shelves through the dishwasher.

I texted the chat that we should come up with a plan to prevent this, and suggested splitting the fridge up by person. My friend texted privately and said that she wouldn't have enough room for her stuff if we did that. I just chalked it up to the fridge already being messy before we moved in and let it go.

Spring semester, it started happening again, and I just got fed up. I moved food that belonged to me to my room. My boyfriend was moving, so he offered to give me his fridge too. I took it, and my friend mentioned using it as a living-room fridge. I just moved it into my room and used one for food, one for drinks.

I saw them texting again towards the end of the year that the fridge smelled and for everyone to check, and I just said that I had my own fridges in my room. This didn't sit well, and one of our roommates even stopped speaking to us before they moved out.

My friend mentioned that since I was the last to leave I should check to make sure that everything was clean. This pissed me off, since I wasn't even using the fridge, but she had done a lot of cleaning herself, so I did. Of course, it was still disgusting, but I just let her know and didn't bother to clean it.

Most have agreed with me that it's not my job to clean up after others, and it's valid to choose not to participate in using the fridge. However, my roommates were being incredibly passive aggressive about it, and some of my other friends and family think I should have just sucked it up and helped them keep it clean because ""that's what living with people is like"".

47,1dw1nci,AITA - had friends over for drinks to my flat where my girlfriend has just moved in," My (30m) gf (29f) moved into my flat a couple of months ago. Last Saturday, I invited a couple of close friends over. It wasn't really planned but we will regularly hang out at each others places. We were drinking and watching films / sport, and basically settled in for the rest of the day. My gf was there and was welcome to join, although drinking for the sake of drinking isn't really her thing. I will admit when my friends and I are together we can get pretty immature and there is a lot of banter (I realise that to most outside people this would be shit chat but I've known these guys a long time, we have a lot of inside jokes)

My gf and I have been together a couple of months. It is very early in the relationship for her to move in but her landlord was awful, she was looking for somewhere else and I was just moving back into my flat having been letting it out for the last year. It made sense financially for both of us, and I made it clear that if we didn't work out, I'd stay away for a couple of months whilst she found somewhere else to stay, or if we felt it could work we'd live together as friends. I work away Mon - Fri and have accomodation with my job full time, so that would be easy.

My gf doesn't really know my friends well yet, she has met them a couple of times. She didn't really want to hang out with us and went into the bedroom. After 3-4 hours, I went to ask my gf if she was ok and she said she didn't want to hang out with my drunk friends that she barely knew and felt like her privacy was being invaded and asked us to leave. We did, but I've been pretty annoyed by this ever since. I didn't think it was that big a deal, and she was welcome to come and join us. We did leave straight away and went to a bar

So, AITA for putting her in that situation in the first place, or for getting bothered by being asked to leave? I don't find hanging out in my living room with friends that much of a weird / unacceptable thing to do

Edit: forgot to add that main reason I'm annoyed is that I feel she didn't even make an effort to get to know my friends.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the comments. Totally agree I should have asked or discussed first, I hadn't really considered this. It wasn't planned. I literally was talking to a friend, then invited them over, because that was instinctive and what we normally do. But I get that doesn't help from her perspective. Lesson leart.

Money-wise, we are splitting things 50:50. We both understand moving in after such a short period is not common / conventionally encouraged, however, given the unique circumstances she was in (succession of terrible landlords) and the flexibility in my lifestyle, we decided to both take a calculated risk and I wanted to help her out. I put a lot of thought into offering to help her out before I did so, and she put a lot of thought into accepting, after discussing together. Honestly no more risky than getting a lodger from a website in my opinion. More thought than I put into inviting my friends over on a Saturday

50,1dvzptr,AITA For not staying at my boyfriend‚Äôs mom‚Äôs house while we visit? ,"So I (30F) am visiting my boyfriends(43M) family out of state for the first time. I‚Äôve like briefly met them over the phone but not in person. The plan was to stay at his mom‚Äôs house, which I wasn‚Äôt opposed to- until we got there. He hasn‚Äôt been able to go home in a few years, and his mom‚Äôs house has allegedly always been pristinely clean and well kept but that was just not the case. 

The house was honestly in a state of disrepair, smelled horribly of dog and dog piss. She lets the dog go in the garage because she can‚Äôt handle going outside at night (she lives in bumfuck no where there is zero danger). The dog would not shut up the entire first night. She should not have this dog and she can‚Äôt handle it. 

Secondly there is zero phone reception there and she has no internet. My boyfriend ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù he had cell service last time he was there. Zero. We had to drive several miles just to use our phones and plan what we were doing over the weekend. 

But the real last straw was the shower. I already don‚Äôt like staying, bathing, and getting ready in other peoples houses but this shower was the most repulsive looking shower I have ever seen. She has very hard well water and clearly has never scoured the shower once. Brown, black from top to bottom. I t was filthy. I couldn‚Äôt do it.

Edit: to clarify, I do feel bad for this woman. However we live 6 hours away and her other two sons live within an hour and one 15 minutes away. So it‚Äôs extremely frustrating that they are also aware of the house and don‚Äôt help her.

I havent really gotten back in the dating scene, and I have no desire to do so any time in the near future.

Two of my friends (both 24F) keep trying to help me. I went along with it in the beginning because its nice meeting new people, but I dont go in with the intention of starting a serious relationship- which Ive stated multiple times.

I've been friends with these girls for a long time now, and they've seen the type of girls that I've dated in the past, and they all kind of fall under the same type of looks and personality.

What I'm going to say next is going to sound really vapid, but I am very fit, all my gfs in the past have been fit. They know this yet keep trying to set me up with girls who are severely overweight or clearly dont take that great care of themselves. I've started telling them I dont want their help anymore, and to stop.

I went out to a restaurant with them a couple days ago, and I picked them up. On the way there they told me that there was a girl who works there and she wanted to meet me because she thought I was cute. I told them regardless of what she thinks the answer would be no.

We get there and I am introduced to this girl who is the exact opposite of what I said I look for in women to my friends.

She ends up sitting with us the majority of the night because her shift is done, and I am just so fed up with this bullshit of them trying to set me up with someone that I feel like deep down inside they know I wont ever date, that I asked for the bill and paid the tab and said I had to run. I smiled and said to the girl it was really nice to meet her and I dropped all of them off to their homes.

I guess me driving that girl home meant to her that I was interested, because she reached out to me on facebook, instagram, and they gave her my number so she pm'd me on it too.

I got really angry at the both of them. I told them not to fking help me anymore, and that they know what I look for in women yet constantly try and set me up with someone who they know Ill have 0 interest in.

For those who doesn't know this type has really fine spine/ hair that will easily get stuck and very hard to get rid of and itches like hell. So, I tend to keep the entire set far far away from guest/ child play area in a container.

Now the issue is, yesterday, when I was at work, few guests came to visit. Since they decided to get a tour of the house, the daughters saw the cactus collection and later came back to get a better view. Next moment as my younger sister said, one decided to touch the most of them barehand and soon started to get the itch of a lifetime. After trying to wash it with soap with making it even worse, they had to rush to doctor since her hands started swell due to irritation. 

Now my mom and older sister ( whose guest they were) is demanding I get rid of the entire collection since its poisonous ( these are not ) cause my niece might get hurt next. I don't feel any remorse and actually pissed because three of my seed pods and some flower are damaged because of her rough handling and she should have basic self preservation to know "" don't touch prickly things"".

Funny thing is even my niece knows better to touch these with hands and three of them of her own ( birthday gift from me ) and she handles them just fine with gloves. 

FYI, the girl who got picked was 17 from what I know.
So, folks am I the asshole for not apologizing and not throwing away my prickly cactus?

Edit : the mother as she later told me, the girl thought they were fake cause she didn't know cactus can have real flower and few of her friends had the fake thing and bunch of flowers at their home. So she acted dumbly. I am mostly pissed at my own family cause if they let guests close to my plants this time, how many other times they allowed guests to damage my things and later told the bird broke them.

Edit 2. They were not in my room. I used to keep them in my room/table when her pet piegon and dove killed my first batch. but in room the cactus used to get knocked out or latch into clothes. Also spill dust in the table surface. So I had to move them above her bird cage with net cover.

Now my mom and older sister ( whose guest they were) is demanding I get rid of the entire collection since its poisonous ( these are not ) cause my niece might get hurt next. I don't feel any remorse and actually pissed because three of my seed pods and some flower are damaged because of her rough handling and she should have basic self preservation to know "" don't touch prickly things"".

Funny thing is even my niece knows better to touch these with hands and three of them of her own ( birthday gift from me ) and she handles them just fine with gloves. 

FYI, the girl who got picked was 17 from what I know.
So, folks am I the asshole for not apologizing and not throwing away my prickly cactus?

Edit : the mother as she later told me, the girl thought they were fake cause she didn't know cactus can have real flower and few of her friends had the fake thing and bunch of flowers at their home. So she acted dumbly. I am mostly pissed at my own family cause if they let guests close to my plants this time, how many other times they allowed guests to damage my things and later told the bird broke them.

Edit 2. They were not in my room. I used to keep them in my room/table when her pet piegon and dove killed my first batch. but in room the cactus used to get knocked out or latch into clothes. Also spill dust in the table surface. So I had to move them above her bird cage with net cover. Even though it's common space, no one really goes there cause bird poop except when the flower blooms.",0.0,0.08656705915927887,0,1
55,1dvyvq4,AITA for telling my best friend to sell his bitcoin when it was worth $25k?,"I bought my best friend's son a bitcoin for his 1st birthday back in the day when they were $400 in 2015. I personally had been buying since 2012 so I knew about btc earlier on.

Anyway since 2015 crypto went up to like 60k at some point and dropped back down. In 2023 I was worried his investment would drop even more. And since crypto is a risky investment I suggested he sell because $25k is still a lot of money he could use for college one day or just let it grow in a mutual fund. idk. At that time I wasn't really selling any of my personal crypto.

I told him exactly what I said above. It can go up to $100k or down to zero but $25k was still lots of money. I didn't really pressure him to sell and I told him I wasn't selling my own crypto.

Anyway, he told me that made him start thinking about it endlessly and then he sold it at 25k. This year it went back up to $70k and we are in bad relations. He told me his wife calls me the village idiot and he's the village idiot's ""r-tard friend who could have been rich"". They are about to go through a divorce and he told me it's because I involved myself in their life. So we stopped talking.

I was trying to do a good thing for my friend originally and if you told me back in 2015 my $400 gift would turn into $25k one day I would be so happy. But because of this situation I lost a friend and I can see it from his viewpoint.

56,1dvxl04,AITA FOR NOT SELLING MY MOMS CAMERA THIS MORNING ,"For context, my mom has a severe gambling addiction. I've watched her lose thousands of dollars and tried to stop her, but it's out of control. This all started when her mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and only had two weeks to live. Since then, my mom has been on a downward spiral.

A few important details:
1. My mom bought a $500 camera with her mom's life insurance money. It was something she always wanted, and it means a lot to her.
2. My rent increased by $200/month last year, making it hard for me to afford food. My mom knows how much I've been struggling. Despite earning more and having her boyfriend's income, we split the bills evenly. I spend $500 of my $700 monthly income on rent, while my mom gets around $1800/month, and her boyfriend has a full-time job, a government grant, government assistance, and child tax benefits.

Yesterday, we talked about money, and my mom said the extra $200/month for rent was nothing to her and not to worry about it. So I paid $300 for rent, and she said that was fine. However, this morning she was screaming at 7 AM about needing money for a bazar event, then I heard her yelling about not landing on a specific number because she was ""trying to earn rent money"" when she told me last night it was totally fine. She must have already lost some and so now she was trying to earn it back. She then asked me to sell her camera at a pawn shop because she hasn't used it. I think she's going to gamble the money away, and we ended up yelling at each other, making my little brother cry.

My mom blames me for making my problems her problems and for them not going to the event. In reality, even if I sold the camera, she could lose the money gambling. He thinks it's my fault because he loves and believes his ""mom."" And he thinks it's my fault he's not going, and he is possibly right.

I might be the asshole because I argud with my mom. Additionally, I'm not willing to sell the camera, which she doesn't use, potentially causing her to miss out on the event she wants to attend. Because I know her, she has wanted one her entire life. She finally has a really good one, and she might lose it for like 10 seconds of nothing. I might come across as unsympathetic to her struggles, even though I'm just trying to protect her and my brother.

There's also a high chance if she goes to this event, she will run into my cousin. The two of them haven't spoken in a year and a half since my cousin stopped talking to us, which has caused my mom a lot of internal stress. I think going to this event altogether is a bad idea, and she is desperately seeking some kind of drama. I altogether think it's crazy but I, like usual, feel very bad. She doesn't even want to be the one to go into the pawn shop and sell it herself; everything always needs to be done by me. Then it's my fault when it goes wrong.

I recently visited my boyfriend Mike‚Äôs hometown for the first time. It‚Äôs a rural area upstate, and his close friend Jake‚Äôs family owns a farm. We spent a day there, and while Mike and Jake we catching up we wandered around and Jake took us in the barn on the property. Once we got in the area with all this hay everywhere, I look around and see a bunch of cats!

The cats looked a bit‚Ä¶rough to be honest. Skinny, matted fur, one was limping. It honestly hurt my heart to see the cats in this state so I immediately in my head was like, ‚Äúhow do I get one of the kittens out of here‚Äù. I‚Äôve been wanting to get another cat since mine passed away about 6 months ago, so I thought this may be a good opportunity to do that and help out an animal in need.

So later that night at dinner, I asked Jake about the condition of the barn cats. He laughed and said they were just barn cats, no big deal. He said that they‚Äôre used to fending for themselves and that they‚Äôre tough animals. I tried to lightly allude that I‚Äôd be able to take one of the kittens there, but I don‚Äôt think he understood.

When we got back home after the trip, I brought up the idea of adopting one of the barn cats to Mike. He immediately seemed suspect and connected the dots and asked if that‚Äôs why I was being weird at dinner the other day. I said yes.

He then told me to mind my own business and assured me that the cats were fine. He went on this tangent about how I don‚Äôt know about country life (I grew up in the city) and something about rodents and all this other stuff about the cats. To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt really listening because in my mind, these cats are being treated horribly, you can‚Äôt justify it. And I‚Äôm not asking to take all these cats. Just one. It‚Äôs not going to hurt anything!

So I pressed further, saying that these cats clearly needed better care and that I could provide it for at least one of them.

Mike got really annoyed and told me to drop it, saying that I was being disrespectful and that I didn‚Äôt understand how things work around there. We ended up having a bit of a fight over it, and it‚Äôs very frosty between us.

I also have school on weekdays from 6am to 3pm and tuition from 4pm to 6pm. And after that cooking from 7pm to 8pm. It is a demanding chore and since my father gets sick, i have to take care of his medicine as well as make sure his blood pressure was fine and so on started when i was 15 years old. After high school and it is the holiday
 for like 3 to 4 months before continuing my studies, i still do my regular chores of cooking, helping my parents with the business on weekends, and helping my dad with his medicine. This is taking a toll on me since helping with the business means I have to exposed to our financial situation since I was young and having to take care of my dad instead of the opposite of him taking care of myself. Whenever my dad could not eat, my mom would blame me for not cooking what he wanted since i was the cook. Whenever the house is not clean, my mom will blame me for not cleaning the house. I finally got into college and the first time went to a dorm. The first week is hell because we have a bunch of activities from 4am to 5pm. After the first week, they allowed us home and when i first got back home around 6pm, i was expected to cook. And i said that i'm tired and i had just gotten back home and then my family would tell me that they were also tired after working the whole day and told me to cook. I did it and it's just tiring knowing that i was not treated like their daughter who had just gone through dorm life for the first time in her lifetime. I fall sick the next day and when i told my mom when she came back home in the evening, she kinda ignores my topic. Yes, she will said that ""oh are you ok"" and then i replied back something along the lines of me feeling sick, and after that the conversation ended.

63,1dvvtll,AITA for not waking my father up in time to leave for his doctor‚Äôs appointment and causing him to be late?,"My (22F) father(51M) had a doctor‚Äôs appointment in the city 1 hour and 30 mins away. Since the drive is so long, he asked me earlier that week if I would like to come up with him to keep him company and to look after his 2 dogs. I agreed since I work later that evening and his appointment was for 8 am. Since the appointment is so far away and so early, my father gave me the heads up that we had to leave no later than 6:15 am in order to be on time.

I set an alarm for 5:30 am and accidentally snoozed it and woke up at 6 am. I rushed to get ready and thankfully was ready just in time for 6:15 am. My father had yet to come out of his room at 6:15 so I gave him some grace thinking he might be running late as well. 

Fast forward to 15 minutes later, he still had not come out. At this point I knocked on his door and found that he was still asleep. I woke him up and he was obviously distressed when he found out he slept in. While he was getting ready, I took the dogs outside to pee and put them in the truck. 

Around 5-7 minutes later he comes out and hurriedly gets in the truck. Immediately he begins to berate and belittle me for my stupidity for not waking him up and causing him to be late. He said I should‚Äôve woken him up immediately when I saw he was not ready to leave at 6:15 and that I‚Äôm stupid and useless for not doing so. 

Furthermore in the rush, we forgot to pack the dog‚Äôs leashes so he made me buy some at a pet store because it‚Äôs my fault I didn‚Äôt pack them and caused him to be late. He then went on to insult me throughout the entire drive up to his appointment and jabbed his fingers at my head talking about how stupid I am. 

I shut down and apologized and did not move or speak the entire drive up. Basically I disassociated. I did not try to fight back because I knew there was no reasoning and did not want to anger him further. After apologizing multiple times, he continues to insult me but a part of me feels like he‚Äôs deflecting responsibility onto me out of anger.

65,1dvv9sr,WIBTA for telling my brother to shove it,"My mom (61) has always thrown a lot of loud, raucous pool parties. Most summers she throws a party every other week but recently she allowed my brother (38) + his family (wife (40) and two kids ages 2 & 5) to move into her house. Now, my mom is babysitting a lot and she is living by the schedule of a family with two young kids. So we have all spent less time together at her pool this year. 

She decided she still wants to throw her annual pool party and BBQ on the Fourth of July. The party was scheduled to start at five but my wife (30) and I (31) planned to bring her cousin (25) and her cousin‚Äôs boyfriend (27) to the pool at two so we could get some sun before the party started. I okay‚Äôed this with my mom on the third. 

My wife‚Äôs cousin arrived at the pool a little before we did and let herself through the gate and down to the pool in the backyard, as is the custom at my mom‚Äôs pool. 

My brother‚Äôs wife came outside to tell my wife‚Äôs cousin she had arrived for the party three hours early and asked her to leave until the party‚Äôs scheduled start time. 

So my guests are left standing on the edge of my mom‚Äôs pool while my brother calls me to say that he invited some special guests to arrive at 3:30. On the call, I ignore his request and arrive at the pool like I planned at two. 

When I got to the pool my brother pulled me inside and told me I need to check with him or his wife before I bring anyone to the pool. 

Around three my mom came out to the pool and I was still steamed so I told her what my brother said and she reassured me that this is her house 100% and I can bring my wife and her family swimming anytime. 

My question is would I be an asshole for telling my brother how embarrassed I was by his behavior and requesting he have a talk with our mom about his authority at her house?

67,1dvv48e,AITA for stealing my sister's dog?,"Alright, so there is a little context as to why I'm so involved with this dog. I 18F lost my beloved dog Bella last October after 10 years together. A few weeks ago, my mom asked me if I'd be okay bringing another dog into the house. At this time, she framed this as a 'Family' dog.When we were discussing getting him. It was framed that he'd be everyone's and that I'd  have to help pay, so I ended up helping pay for all of his shit, food, toys, leash, treats, etc. I literally said I did not want to get another dog if it wasn't a family dog.

Only after we got home with the dog did they inform me that this Is infact to be my sister's dog only. In my mom's words,'Just let her call it her dog' I was upset at being lied to. Which i tried to bring up, which only ended up getting shut down. and believe me, she rubbed this in my face hard, which hurt as I lost my even a full year ago now. 
Turns out they gave the dog to us sick. My sister ends up having to clean up tons of dog puke, and every time she asks me to, I just go, ""Your dog."" She yells at him every time he pukes the poor boy. Whenever he does something she doesn't want to deal with is when he's conveniently.'Our dog.'

Anyway though Here's where I 'steal' the dog. I end up spending tons of time with him and bonding with the poor boy. At this point, the dog has pretty much taken to me, and point blank ignores her. I might be an asshole because it was kind of intentional. My sister has never been one for animals, really, and I knew she ignored him to play fortnite most of the day. I was still pissed at her rubbing my dead dog in my face, so as much as I just like the new dog in general it was kind of to spite her too that that I ended up being his favorite person. It wasn't hard to bond with him when she literally only got up once to walk him. She also literally can not even give this dog his pills because he doesn't trust her at all. Probably because she literally never spends time with him. I work long ass shifts and somehow spend more time than she, someone with nothing but free time for the summer does.  This dog would not have water if I didn't make her get off her lazy ass and get it for him.

 She's mad now that the dog won't listen when I go to work and wants me to ignore him for a few weeks so that she can bond with him. I point blank told her ""Go fuck yourself"" because she ignores him half the time anyway and I'm not interested in playing mind games with the poor dog. She also doesn't like my nickname for him which is bub or bubs and told me to ""STOP calling MY dog bubs."" Which I admit I also said that she can go fuck herself for.

69,1dvuwcl,AITA for telling my parents I won't go to my half sister's birthday dinner?,"My (17m) half sister (almost 27f) is turning 27 in two weeks. Her husband and his family and my half brother (25m) have planned a birthday dinner for her and the ILs invited my parents, her mom and stepdad, and me. Her husband then suggested it might be better if I stayed home since I'm not old enough to drink. But I know the real reason for the suggestion is my half siblings don't really want anything to do with me. They don't want my dad around either but he gets invited because my mom wouldn't go without him. She also wouldn't ever leave me behind from normal stuff so they invite me but they normally don't talk to me or only do like basic hi and bye if they have people who'd question it, like mom.

My mom genuinely believes things are better now that they're older. That I'm a sibling in their eyes. But I know it's not true.

My mom and dad think I could still go to the dinner and they won't drink either so we'll be cool. I told them I'd prefer to stay at home and if it was going to be a big deal, me being there, then they should go without me. Mom called my half brother and he made like 100 excuses about why I should stay at home. Mom called him out for making it sound like he doesn't want me to go. She ended up calling my half sister then who also made a bunch of excuses but when mom started to ask why it would be such a big deal to have me at a restaurant she said it was fine if I was there.

I'm really not looking forward to the party so I told my parents I'm not going because I don't want to go and they should go without me.

My mom was really upset about it and she told me I should be there to support my sister, that I shouldn't let the excuses get me down because they really do want me there. My dad told me as long as they're civil like they are with him, as painful as it can be, we should still show up because we are a family at the end of the day.

For those wondering on more BG: Their dad, my mom's first husband, died and mom remarried quickly. They never adjusted to that and they always kept my dad at a distance and me too. I don't think they hate us. But I know they wish mom hadn't brought us into their lives. They tolerate our presence to keep mom. But I have never felt loved, liked or cared for by them and I know they don't consider me a sibling. I have heard them say they have one sibling only before.

Also, my half sister's husband pretty much knows the way things are. Her ILs don't seem to be as aware when they invited me so readily. Both half siblings send me birthday cards and Christmas cards every year but they never reply if I say thanks, they never reply to any texts or DMs I send, so I stopped reaching out except for the thanks.

My dad told me as long as they're civil like they are with him, as painful as it can be, we should still show up because we are a family at the end of the day.

For those wondering on more BG: Their dad, my mom's first husband, died and mom remarried quickly. They never adjusted to that and they always kept my dad at a distance and me too. I don't think they hate us. But I know they wish mom hadn't brought us into their lives. They tolerate our presence to keep mom. But I have never felt loved, liked or cared for by them and I know they don't consider me a sibling. I have heard them say they have one sibling only before.

Also, my half sister's husband pretty much knows the way things are. Her ILs don't seem to be as aware when they invited me so readily. Both half siblings send me birthday cards and Christmas cards every year but they never reply if I say thanks, they never reply to any texts or DMs I send, so I stopped reaching out except for the thanks.

71,1dvu4c5,AITA for not apologizing for calling my coworker's parents choice of cat cruel?,"Throwaway because other coworkers know my main. 

This happened yesterday. Me and my coworkers were having lunch in the break room and the topic were cats and cat breeds. Things like pure breeds, why some are more expensive and so on. General stuff. 

I made a comment about Munchkins and that I think it's cruel to intentionally breed them with a defect for cuteness factor. Some people agreed, but one coworker looked really pissed. She pulled out her phone with a picture of a munchkin and said that it was her parent's cat. Awkward..... 

She went on about how happy and healthy it was and that I have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm no cat expert, but I stood by what I said and I also said that I don't think there is an excuse for owning such a cat. The discussion sort of fizzled out after that, but I could tell she was still pissed.

She and I are in the same team and our boss later pulled me aside to ask for my side of the story. This is now an issue, as my coworker doesn't want to work with me on an ongoing project. My boss says she understand, but still asked me to apologize and make up. I can see my boss point of view, but I really don't want to. I was also pissed that coworker went and complained to our boss about this and now refuses to work with me over such a small thing. 

Later, my friend in another department wrote to me and said my coworker is calling me an asshole to other coworkers. This friend said he agrees with me about the cat, but think I should just apologize and get on with our lives.

AITA for not wanting to apologize? I'd hate that this would affect our working relationship, but I don't feel like I did anything wrong. As I said, I'm no cat expert and I know I can be stubborn sometimes.

The asshole is using the identity of her favourite musician and basically romancing her.

She hides her phone, throws fits, and tells us how we want to ruin her life. She is pushing us all away for ""him"". 


We are terrified of what could come of this. We know he's already asked her for money, but she doesn't know how to use Internet banking/PayPal or anything like that. What's scary is that she's sent him her address (she lives with my 60yo mum) some of my mums personal info, some info about me, and pictures of my kids (newborn and toddler). My husband (M30) is livid and I'm terrified. We've tried to tall to her nicely, but she doesn't seem to grasp that it's not the artist texting her ""how are you my darling."" 


She claims its because nobody ever visits her or talks to her. That honestly hurtful because my mom is her caretaker every day and I'm over with my kids to keep her company almost every single day, we take her out, etc, We are doing our damn best to keep grandma happy and she pushed us away for some scumbag.

Strict measures, you know the drill. At that time, we were living abroad, so crossing borders was nearly impossible. When he got the invite, we had only been together for a few months, so it was a fresh relationship (they invited him alone). I was working in a COVID ward and managed to get him across the border as a worker in a private car (about an 8-hour journey), and I also got him a PCR test 2 hours before departure (I mention this because the whole arrangement wasn‚Äôt easy).

Four years later, we were getting married in chateau (about 4 hours from both my family and his, so halfway) and invited the friend along with his wife and child. They said they‚Äôd come and make a trip out of it, exploring the area. He was the only friend for whom we paid accommodation right at the venue, just like for family (5* hotel). I was already struggling with this, as we had agreed not to cover accommodation for friends. It‚Äôs also worth noting that this friend is a teacher and the wedding was on a Saturday, a week before the end of the school year.

A few days before the wedding, they called to say they wouldn‚Äôt come because he didn‚Äôt get leave for Monday and it wasn‚Äôt worth the trip for just a few days. We ended up paying for the room since it was too late to cancel. We didn‚Äôt receive a gift or even a congratulatory card from them.

Today, they wrote saying they want to visit because they‚Äôre going to an event in our city and would appreciate accommodation for them and his sister.

My friends tell me I should just quit nagging and say nothing, but I feel like if I say nothing, he will stop trying to lose weight and if something happens, I will resent him or feel bad that I didn‚Äôt do more.  It has come to a point where I am no longer attracted to him and having sex is just a chore.  It‚Äôs gotten so bad I don‚Äôt have any physical attraction to him.  I am not sure what to do.  He has tried doing his own diet and exercising whenever he can, but it‚Äôs not really working. AITA for being insistent on him losing weight?   ",0.0,0.9875677824020386,1,0

83,1dvrnqs,WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt tell my family that I had my baby until a day or two after?,"So I‚Äôm due any day now with my first baby. Both sides of the family are VERY excited, this is the first grandbaby on both sides, and even the aunts and uncles are excited about their ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù. My in laws originally asked to be in the hospital for the birth but I let them know that I don‚Äôt want any hospital visitors, and will probably wait until we‚Äôve had a couple days at home for me to recover/adjust until having any visitors at all. They‚Äôve been pretty quiet on the subject, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre disappointed but they‚Äôve been respectful so I have no worries there and plan to send them a message or phone them when baby arrives. 

The issue is with my family - specifically my sister. I‚Äôve told her many times now of our plans around visitors but she keeps insisting that she wants to bring me food to the hospital, I‚Äôve politely told her that won‚Äôt be necessary but it would be great for her to bring food when she visits at home. She still has been making comments about bringing food to the hospital and even joked that she should be the first to hold the baby after my husband and I because my mom did all my ultrasounds and was technically the first to ‚Äúsee baby‚Äù (she just happened to work as head sonographer at the clinic nearest to us, bc I had my choice on where to go for scans I obviously chose my mom because I knew I would get the best treatment with her level of experience). She‚Äôs also made passing comments about needing reminders not to kiss etc and overall just makes a lot of ‚Äújokes‚Äù about boundary stomping that makes me feel like I should wait until I‚Äôm 100% ready for visitors to tell her and my parents - I hate to loop my parents into it because they‚Äôve been nothing but supportive and respectful this whole time but my sister lives with them so I know it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to tell them and not my sister. 

My worry is that by telling the in laws before my own family that feelings will be hurt and I could be setting myself up for major backlash, it feels like I‚Äôm torn between fighting for my boundaries to be respected PP or fighting over hurting peoples feelings that they found out a day or two later than everyone else. Should I just wait a couple days to tell anyone at all? I don‚Äôt know if hubs could manage that given he gets so excited about baby news and I know how much he looks forward to telling his family. 

ETA: I‚Äôm mostly considering this because after all the comments made, especially when I saw my sister today it‚Äôs really made me feel like I‚Äôm an incubator to her and just around to give her a niece, she doesn‚Äôt have or plan to ever have kids so I don‚Äôt think she will understand how vulnerable and special the moment is and likely wants to force herself in on my experience so she can get a sense of what it would be like.

86,1dvrdou,"AITA for Not Sharing My Private Life with My Best Friends, Leading Them to Cut Me Off? (25F)","I'm a 25-year-old living in Tokyo. I met my friends (26F) and (23M), who both live in Australia, on a gaming app four years ago during COVID. We've developed a strong bond, meeting in person and traveling abroad together.

To give some background, I'm a mother to a 7-year-old. I decided to marry the father of my child last December for my child's future. We‚Äôve been together on and off for eight years. I love him as family, but I no longer see him as a romantic partner‚Äîwe rarely kiss anymore. I've shared everything about myself with my best friends.

To be honest, I know I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôve played around a lot, and my boyfriend-now-husband has always been aware of it. He mentioned it a few times but chose to stay quiet. This is something we manage between us.

The problem started when I developed feelings for someone else (24M). I told my best friends about it. Despite being married, I enjoy hanging out with this new guy. We hold hands and hug, but there's no sex. I told him I like him, but we both agreed not to pursue a relationship. We're just enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

I met my friends (26F) and (23M), who both live in Australia, on a gaming app four years ago during COVID. We've developed a strong bond, meeting in person and traveling abroad together.

To give some background, I'm a mother to a 7-year-old. I decided to marry the father of my child last December for my child's future. We‚Äôve been together on and off for eight years. I love him as family, but I no longer see him as a romantic partner‚Äîwe rarely kiss anymore. I've shared everything about myself with my best friends.

To be honest, I know I‚Äôm not perfect. I‚Äôve played around a lot, and my boyfriend-now-husband has always been aware of it. He mentioned it a few times but chose to stay quiet. This is something we manage between us.

The problem started when I developed feelings for someone else (24M). I told my best friends about it. Despite being married, I enjoy hanging out with this new guy. We hold hands and hug, but there's no sex. I told him I like him, but we both agreed not to pursue a relationship. We're just enjoying each other‚Äôs company.

I have spent the last few weeks with her 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week supervising her. This has mainly taken place at my house as I have 3 dogs, 2 in potty training and a senior dog who is partially incontinent. 
       A few days ago, she decided she no longer wanted to spend the time at my house but at her own and had my sister, 34 female, deliver the message to me. She is still being supervised and I am not able to bring my dogs to her apartment. I told my sister I couldn't leave the dogs that long and wasn't able to afford to drive back and forth several times a day to let them out as my mother lives 30 minutes away. My sister got really upset and stormed off slamming the door in my face. 
      I talked with my brother, 24 male, about the situation and apparently it had been a hot topic of conversation between them all. What I had said been transformed into I was completely unwilling to help at all. I was told that because I am currently unemployed it was my responsibility and because I was not willing to do what my mother wanted I was causing my sister to have to call out from work.

I, 31 female, have been helping my mother, 50 female, with her mental health issues. I have spent the last few weeks with her 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week supervising her. This has mainly taken place at my house as I have 3 dogs, 2 in potty training and a senior dog who is partially incontinent. 
       A few days ago, she decided she no longer wanted to spend the time at my house but at her own and had my sister, 34 female, deliver the message to me. She is still being supervised and I am not able to bring my dogs to her apartment. I told my sister I couldn't leave the dogs that long and wasn't able to afford to drive back and forth several times a day to let them out as my mother lives 30 minutes away. My sister got really upset and stormed off slamming the door in my face. 
      I talked with my brother, 24 male, about the situation and apparently it had been a hot topic of conversation between them all. What I had said been transformed into I was completely unwilling to help at all. I was told that because I am currently unemployed it was my responsibility and because I was not willing to do what my mother wanted I was causing my sister to have to call out from work.

He has come to visit her once. I never met him, saw him once. 

The story is that his marriage has been over for a while and he‚Äôs waiting until his kids graduate high school in a couple years before he and his wife split up. He claims his wife ‚Äúlives‚Äù in the basement of their large house and they co-parent their kids in house. What kind of shit show that must be.  If true. 

My sister had a physical relationship with him in the first several months and she stopped it until he gets divorced, but the emotional part continues. When I pressed her a little bit, she said he really loves his house (excuse) and doesn‚Äôt want to sell it. They speak every day and every night and she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait for him.‚Äù Wtf!!!!

IMO, She is wasting her time with this guy and his story seems suspect. And does she really want to start a relationship this way even if he does sell his house and leave his wife? As bad as it might be, he‚Äôs not leaving his relationship, will never sell his house and when the kids leave, he‚Äôll come up with some excuse as to why the timing isn‚Äôt right (and never will be).

A majority of that time has been long distance since he works in NYC and I am in Mumbai. Chad is a really sweet guy overall and communicates well, despite the 9.5 hours of time difference.
We had met on Hinge and he had told me before as well that he felt ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt look like my pictures‚Äô. There have also been comments where he has equated my weight to my health and stated that I only want for my partner to be ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô. All of these comments have made me feel even more insecure about my body.

I‚Äôve struggled with body image issues all my life. I‚Äôm a chubby girl and it has taken me years to accept my body. By no means am I plus size (above XXL), but I fall in the mid size range (L-XL). However I have always been made to feel shitty about my body through comments made by my family, friends, ex boyfriends where the general narrative has always been ‚Äòyou will look prettier if you lost some weight‚Äô.

Recently, I was talking to Chad about proposals and how I would want a cute proposal for myself in the future. I mentioned that I also have a dress already picked out for the occasion, if it ever were to happen. This is a dress I bought a year ago, long before I started seeing Chad.
He asked to see the dress so I sent him a mirror selfie of me wearing the dress. His first comment after seeing the picture was ‚ÄòYou look beautiful but you need to reduce your tummy to look better‚Äô
I was really hurt and all those years of traumatising comments related to my body came back to me. I started crying involuntarily because that dress means a lot to me and suggesting that I need a flatter stomach to look good in that dress really upset me. He apologised for his comment but also went ahead to say that it‚Äôs not a big deal and ‚ÄòI just want you to be healthy. Why are you reacting this way‚Äô. He also mentioned that ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt you want healthy babies? You would have to be healthy yourself for that‚Äô
I was really hurt and the conversation didn‚Äôt end well. He apologised a few times but also got irritated later because I was apparently grilling him too much.

So here is where I might be the AH. Apparently some of the dates I used contradicted my BIL‚Äôs dates/knowledge. I admit he has a better overall grasp on the topic than me I just know that 1 really well.

After the wedding my sister texted me and cussed me out saying that I made her husband look dumb since I listed off the right dates. (Apparently his friends looked the dates up after I left and I was correct, not him.)

106,1dvnphn,"WIBTA for un inviting my friend from a trip, 9 days before we leave?","I'm (17M) turning 18 in a week and planned a 2 day trip away. Inviting my best friend (18F), boyfriend (18M) and another friend (18NB). I'll called them Leven. Leven is the one I want to uninvite.

Some backstory. Leven and I started talking about 6 months ago. Became friends at 13 ish. I then cut them off when I was 16 because they got back with their shitty ex day before the breakup party, didn't tell me, and we still had the party. I probably overreacted, Leven can do what they want, but lying to me and going through with celebration hurt me.  

In the time we weren't talking, Leven dated my abusive ex knowing full well what they did. I forgave them. I knew exactly what Leven was going through, I didn't want them to deal with that pain alone. 

I opened up with them more than anyone else, I just didn't want Leven to feel alone. 

My boyfriend told me that Leven was talking shit about me to an old friend (I'll call Rosie). Rosie didn't care at all when I got sick and was in the hospital or was diagnosed with an incurable condition, I nicely confronted Rosie for not caring. She lied and made excuses. I brought evidence she was lying and called her a bitch. 

So she turned anyone against me she could. Telling them I was a bad person for being so mean to her . Even tried it on my boyfriend lol.

In a month I lost all my friends except one, and was dealing with the first diagnosis of multiple disabilities and incurable conditions. I had to drop out of college mourned the life I can never have now. 

I don't hate Rosie for what she did, her home life wasn't great and I assume that's why she hurt me  but I hate that she did that to me when I was already going through enough.

Back to Leven. They admitted to hanging out with Rosie, only because they go to the same club. But said they didn't talk shit about me, *just* showed Rosie private dms where we talked about our shared abusive ex.

Leven can talk to whomever they want. 

But sharing dms where I talked about the abuse I went through was a big violation of privacy. I wouldn't have been okay with this no matter who it was shared with... But Rosie? A person who hates me and is probably laughing at my abuse? I can't even explain how I feel. Bad. Very very bad. 

This trip is so important to me. It's to celebrate overcoming so much in my life. I don't want Leven there for something so important after they've upset me so many times now. 

I have paid for everything so far, Leven has 0 financial stakes to lose. 

Leven also said ""Ah I'm sorry man"" and ""sorry lol"". They don't feel genuine but they did apologise. Plus, Leven said they didn't see anything wrong with sharing the dms. So they didn't mean to hurt me.

Leven is dealing with a lot atm and I know this trip is gonna be good for em. I don't want to take this away, especially on such short notice.

107,1dvno6z,"AITA for declining to go on annual vacation with girlfriend's family, but suggested another trip for us two further down the road?","My girlfriend (F/35) and I (M/40) have been dating for 1.5 years. Once a year, her family does a big annual vacation out of the country involving my gf, her parents and her brother's family of 4 (two toddlers). This year, they are doing it over Christmas and when asked, I declined. Weeks later, I mentioned a dream of mine is to do a overseas road trip to a small scenic town in Canada and suggested the two of us could do it sometime next year. Gf got upset and asked me why I was open to planning a trip for us two but declined to join her family vacation. She asked if I did not want to go on vacation with her family.

I declined to go because someone in my family is has a life-threatening illness and I want to save vacation time this year for any sudden life event. (Next calendar year is a new round of vacation leave, obvs) There are also other reasons. Because of my own family's dynamics, I see vacation time with a partner vs with her family as completely different things. My family is not close and my immediate family has not done a trip together in over 20 years. I don't even talk or see my parents often - there's just no need to. This is different from hers where the whole family is constantly talking and on groupchats, and they love big family gatherings. The idea of doing a long trip with family - especially someone else's family - scares me. Her family is very nice to me and I've met her parents about 4 times, but I still feel I need time to come to terms with that concept.

I'll add that her family's vacation is already being booked and locked in, so I had to reply yes or no almost immediately. On the other hand, my road trip suggestion is just that - a suggestion that is not remotely close to being confirmed or acted on. EDIT: It is understood that all my travel plans are contingent on the condition of my family member's sickness.

I'm not sure how to feel about this still. AITA, or is she justified in being upset?

My wife (53F) and I (53M) and were out for dinner at a fancy schmancy restaurant over the weekend. After the main course, I could feel a piece of meat was stuck between my molars and I wasn't able to dislodge it with my tongue. 

I should preface this by saying that I have a bit of problem with my teeth. I get food stuck pretty easily and I have to floss my teeth after almost every meal. 

I didn't have any floss with me and this bit of really delicious steak that made me so happy just minutes earlier, was now making me miserable. At an opportune moment when no one was looking at me (especially my wife), I tried to get it out with my dessert fork. Of course, just then my wife turned her head and caught me. 

She proceeded to dress me down for my faux pas. Don't hate on her, because she didn't cause a scene and while she was hostile, she WAS not abusive. In fairness, I also knew what was going to happen if I got caught.

I‚Äôm autistic and I have a very hard time expressing my genuine feelings about certain things, especially grand gestures of love. Like if someone threw a party for me I wouldn‚Äôt really know how to respond, and I might come off as ungrateful or rude.

She was talking about this tattoo for over a year, and I never knew how to respond. I admit I kind of brushed it off, showing appreciation but again, I didn‚Äôt take it seriously.

But as you probably guessed, she eventually got it. But it didn‚Äôt look right.
I usually draw when I‚Äôm depressed, and this drawing wasn‚Äôt an exception. It was an eerie young boy with a goat head and a space helmet floating through space.

But when she showed it to me, she told me how the artist had to change it for ease of drawing reasons. Ok, that‚Äôs fine.

But instead of the cartoony style it was originally in, it resembled a more meme kind of situation you‚Äôd see on a t-shirt or Facebook post. The full mittens were turned into mitten shaped hooves, it was more realistic, and has sunglasses. Overall I think it looks bland and kind of ugly but when I saw it, of course I didn‚Äôt say that.

Honestly I would‚Äôve been fine with the tattoo but the changes made me upset, because it doesn‚Äôt look like something I‚Äôd draw, ever.
My mom and sister wanted a memento of how (in their words) ‚Äútalented‚Äù I am and how much they love me but this is not at all something I‚Äôd even like to look at.

I 30m have been with my wife 30f for 15 years and have lived together for 8+.   I got home today and found a white pill crushed up on our kitchen table.     My wife got home from work right after me,  so I asked her what‚Äôs up with this pill she got upset and said she did not know and stormed off.     She came back to the room and asked if I was mad I said yes and we started to argue.  I said the drugs are not mine and only the two of us have access to the house so where else could they have come from.    She told me to get out if I‚Äôm going to accuse her of doing drugs.      I said I could care less if she did.   I just hate being straight up lied to.       For history she has never been addicted to or a user of drugs   Except weed       She claims it must have just had something heavy set on top of it    AITA.  The powder looks as if it was chopped up with a card 

Edit/ update whatever.   I appreciate everyone‚Äôs opinions  mostly the ones that I‚Äôm the asshole because I needed to be able to understand what she is thinking.   Some of you had great points, I really expected to get dragged more tho lol  but for the comments saying she a junkie leave her over just the info in the post , you guys have issues that make even mine look minor :\

I think when I wrote the post in anger and frustration I missed a couple main points, and I need to clear a couple things up.    

Firstly the point that I did not care if she did.    I did care just not in anger.

My entire family are addicts , I grew up in drug houses moving from place to place and I have distanced my self from them greatly.

Second it was her reaction to just being asked why is there a crushed pill on our counter that‚Äôs my issue.    If asked I would be confused and ask to see what the hell the person was talking about.   She never looked at it. Her response was as follows    I don‚Äôt know , it‚Äôs not mine , ughhhhhhh, storms off,    Comes back to living room  , Oh your mad?   If you think I did it get the fuck out,     
I said to her if you found it and asked me you would be like wtf to,   She said she did and did not say anything about it days ago.   She thought it was flour ,   I‚Äôm not even convinced that is a pill  ect 

We are sleeping in separate rooms and there is zero chance she will make any attempt to talk or fix this with me in anyway. Even if we don‚Äôt talk for week.  So it will just be up to me to accept her (strange and in my opinion poor ) response to what should have been a pretty confusing but not bad conversation about it.

Picture is on my profile ",No A-holes here,2024-07-05,"AITA for finding drugs in my locked house and assuming they are my wife‚Äôs  I will try and give as much info here as I can remember but here is the story.   I 30m have been with my wife 30f for 15 years and have lived together for 8+.   I got home today and found a white pill crushed up on our kitchen table.     My wife got home from work right after me,  so I asked her what‚Äôs up with this pill she got upset and said she did not know and stormed off.     She came back to the room and asked if I was mad I said yes and we started to argue.  I said the drugs are not mine and only the two of us have access to the house so where else could they have come from.    She told me to get out if I‚Äôm going to accuse her of doing drugs.      I said I could care less if she did.   I just hate being straight up lied to.       For history she has never been addicted to or a user of drugs   Except weed       She claims it must have just had something heavy set on top of it    AITA.  The powder looks as if it was chopped up with a card 

Edit/ update whatever.   I appreciate everyone‚Äôs opinions  mostly the ones that I‚Äôm the asshole because I needed to be able to understand what she is thinking.   Some of you had great points, I really expected to get dragged more tho lol  but for the comments saying she a junkie leave her over just the info in the post , you guys have issues that make even mine look minor :\

I think when I wrote the post in anger and frustration I missed a couple main points, and I need to clear a couple things up.    

Firstly the point that I did not care if she did.    I did care just not in anger.    We are not people that are into that kind of lifestyle and most everyone in our small town is, so for her to start randomly would be very concerning! My entire family are addicts , I grew up in drug houses moving from place to place and I have distanced my self from them greatly.

112,1dvmukj,AITA if i want to spend my birthday alone and not with my bf,"Hi. Firstly please excuse if my english is weird..
Okay so I will be turning 22 next week and I usually spend time with friends and family 1-2 days prior to my actual birthday. Since 4 years I've spent my actual birthday with my boyfriend and I used to love it. 

But on my last birthday my boyfriend slept in late and i called him several times to wake him up but he didn't get up. I had a whole day planned.. So i was furious and heartbroken and cried whole lot.. then i just went out alone and walked around my city all day. He woke around noon and called me continuously for meeting him and that he'll come to where i was. I wasn't really in the mood to see him but he was very persistent so i agreed. Then eventually when he did come, he came empty handed. I don't want expensive gifts or anything but i made his birthday really special last year (which comes before my birthday in July) and even flowers or a birthday card would have been nice. I felt even more sad and it broke my heart that i dont mean as important to him. He said he would make up for it but he never did and we have come round the sun.

Then on Valentine's this year i asked if we could do something together and go out since we never usually did that and it would be fun and romantic. I learnt to knit and made him a muffler and got some candy which I laid out in a rose shape (i saw it on Instagram of that creative claw girl). Again, he came empty handed. I would have been happy with a single flower or a chocolate. 

Both of these incidents made me really sad and i just don't want to hold any expectations this year for my birthday, nor do i want any room for disappointment. So when i told my bf yesterday that I just want to spend my birthday alone he got pissed at me and said that it's not right.

113,1dvmprr,"AITA for leaving my mom in a different state after she accused me of taking $5,000","For context, my 35f mom and I 16f haven't always had the best relationship. My dad passed when I was 10 and she receives $700 every month. I left her house when I turned 15 to live with my ex stepdad and grandma (she moved in due to a law).
Me and my grandma started to work on getting our own place and we did. I told my mom that I wanted her to give me the money every month, but I noticed that I was only getting $300 a month.
My grandma moved back to our home state and I moved in with my boyfriend 16m. We both started working and I bought my own groceries and dog food. After some saving, we bought a car. I started building a relationship back with my mom and we were doing good.
After some family visits back to my home state, me and my boyfriend decided to start saving to move back. I told my mom and we agreed that we would be doing it together.
This all changed when I had to start packing and going through things. I found a bucket that had change that was savings from me and my mom. I exchanged it and got $680 out of it and I put that back for the trip.
My mom noticed and said that I stole $5,000. I was surprised because it was nothing close to that and we stopped talking. She contacted my grandma and cousin, but I talked to them and cleared it up with them. She then threatened me with the police. Me and my bf waited but no cops came. We packed our things and moved states that same day.
I still don't have contact with my mom, but my grandma does. She said that I need to pay her $5,000 and that she is going to keep the benefit money. My grandma wants custody to get ebt and benefits money.
However, my mom is against this because she won't be able to claim me on her tax nor receive the money.

114,1dvmklm,AITA for asking my (F26) partner (F28) to get rid of things her mom got her? ,"UPDATE: Thank you, everyone, for the feedback and validation. We have decided to do as many of you suggested - she will take the large closet and use it for storage + her clothes, and I will have the smaller closet all to myself (huge win in my book). Unfortunately our apartment living/kitchen area isn‚Äôt large enough to warrant us using the table and chairs, so this is the best alternative for now. Thank you all!

AITA for asking my partner to get rid of things her mom got her?

My partner and I have lived together for 3 years, and been dating for 5. Ever since we moved in together she has begun to accumulate large, hefty items. Here is the catalogue: 
- a disc golf goal and accessories from her mom
- a large (6-person) table she refurbished with her dad
- chairs from her mom for said table
- an extra large fold-out table for parties, also from her mom

I obviously have no issue with her having these items in theory, but the problem is she has never once used any of the mentioned items - I‚Äôm not exaggerating. We don‚Äôt have space for a full size table and chairs as we‚Äôve only ever lived in small (~1000sq ft) apartments and it‚Äôs just the two of us. She doesn‚Äôt play disc golf, has never tried, and we have never needed the fold out table either.

For the past 3 years we‚Äôve lived together she has placed her large, unused items in the biggest closet in our apartment, and we‚Äôve used the secondary closet as a shared closet space between the two of us. It‚Äôs absolute chaos - there isn‚Äôt enough room for our clothes and shoes since it‚Äôs just one small closet, and so clothes end up overflowing and things get disorganized easily. As someone who likes things organized, it is often miserable and overwhelming. However, I haven‚Äôt had the heart to push very hard about her getting rid of any of the things mentioned. 

Today, I met my breaking point. We just moved into a new apartment and once again our biggest closet has become a storage unit for things I know she will not touch for the foreseeable future. I asked her if she would be willing to get a storage unit, and she said no ‚ÄúWhy would I pay for a storage unit when the closet works as one?‚Äù I explained that the leftover, smaller closet was not going to work for our clothes, as has been the situation before. She said ‚Äúwell it will have to, it‚Äôs been alright so far‚Äù. I finally said, in a moment of heated anger, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt care enough about that stuff to pay to store it, and you never use it, why don‚Äôt you just get rid of it?‚Äù This offended her and she left for a walk to cool down. 

AITA here? Am I being unreasonable? I know that apartments are tight and things can‚Äôt be perfect, but my god if I have to give up the biggest closet for a 6-person table and chairs and disc golf set that has never once been used AGAIN I‚Äôm going to lose my mind.
