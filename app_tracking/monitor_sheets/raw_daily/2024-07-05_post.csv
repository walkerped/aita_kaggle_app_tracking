0,1dvt5ng,AITA For Finally Standing Up For Myself Towards My Own Friend?,"I need to know if I am the asshole for finally standing up for myself against my own friend. I (FTM/16) met my friend Ethan (M/16) in late 7th Grade and have been friends with until recently in high school. We hit it off very quickly. However, when it came to finishing middle school and going to high school, our school took all the 8th graders to Hawai'i as a promotion gift. I never went since I didn't have to money for it but Ethan and many of my own friends went and had an amazing time as I heard. Few months later, we are Freshmen in high school, I have gotten a partner.Yet, when I told my friends they all said that they thought Ethan and I were dating since Ethan mentioned to everyone on the Hawaiian Trip that we have been dating. I was completely shocked and confused because I was dating my current partner at the time but I said that I have never in my life date him. Which I brushed off since I thought it was just a rumor someone else started. A month later, I heard from my close friends that Ethan has been talking shit about me being gay and transgender. I do understand not everyone supports it, but it confused me since he was also gay for having a secret boyfriend. I did not want to start a scene and upset anyone so again I ignored it and ghosted him. Not even two days later, he blew up on my for ""ignoring him and being a selfish asshole who only cares about themselves"" all because I ignored him? At that point I finally was tired of it and snapped back, saying that he made rumors of us being together and making fun of me for own sexuality and gender and just being a complete asshole for months. He was silent then started denying everything I said while saying that I making up shit and calling me ""retarded"" for even mentioning this to him. After this I told him not to talk to me and I cut him off for weeks. I felt so much better without him in my life for those weeks until he complained to my own friends. He told them to convince me to talk to him and talk everything out. Which I agreed to and met up to talk things out saying that his guy group put him up to everything and was deeply sorry for everything he said because he had emotional since his grandmother had died. I forgave him and comforted him. However, Another month later, everything started up again, and the same fight happened again but with him bring up everything wrong with my life and that I never cared about him or anyone ever in my life. Which again I snapped back and told him to fuck off and left. This fight and forgiving situation happened about 2 or 3 more times, I am mentally and physically exhausted to argue or even fight about anything with him. He only uses the excuse of his grandparents dying or blaming it on his own friends which also hated me to a pretty bad degree. I have not talked to him since the end of Freshmen Year.

They ended up going to the hospital and don‚Äôt tell me at all they‚Äôre on the way, I got a call at noon Thursday once the baby was born and obviously very happy for them, no mention of when to go to the hospital for a visit. 
Later that day (7:30pm) im at the gym and he texts me if I wanna come see the baby but I would have to get there by 8:30pm. I said that I‚Äôll go but then texts me no worries if I can‚Äôt cause I have work the next day. So I tell him yeah it‚Äôs not enough time for me to be able to shower and get there and we can try for Saturday morning and I‚Äôll come by. We end up deciding on Tuesday cause of the long weekend and he‚Äôs concerned of germs. 
Come Tuesday I got to see the baby and he and his wife brutally rip into me about not having come the same day. 

I understand that he had expectations and was upset, but he never made me aware of that and continually made me feel like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and gave me a pass. Am I in the wrong for not having ‚Äúread between the lines‚Äù?
I wouldn‚Äôt have had the same expectation were it me, but everyone is different. 
I also don‚Äôt think it was justified to rip into me over a miscommunication.

In return I would have to cut the grass and clean the house.

Well come to today grass and patio cleaned and the house is cleaned and decorated and she's now coming late bc her gf (she takes 3 hour showers, even though she's been home all day to shower and is coming to my house, which she's gonna sit around and have ample time to shower.) My mom also says she cannot grill anymore because she didn't check the grill and it's dirty. Which she just told me. 

We're I would be an asshole is that I want to text her to not show up like usual. Like just don't come home to celebrate if I'm doing all the preparations. 


Extra context, I live in my moms house. She  however sleeps at her girlfriends house everyday and rare comes home. Mom also forgets to get groceries. She hasn't shown up to any of my extracurricular when I was younger. Or will be in the very back/parking lot and complain or tell me I don't do well enough at my hobbies. We don't do holidays bc we are too poor usually (we finnsly are doing better) 

Also ik the grass should be cut but I have really had allergies and my brother forgets with his add and autism. This grass was 2-3 high, bugs and heat waves lasting all day. Managed to do it by 10:30 cleaning up and making it look presentable early morning.

4,1dvlbuq,AITA for not responding to my sister texts about their boyfriend?,"
My twin sister (22) has recently open up to me about her relationship with a 48 year old man. Some background information is she is mentally handicapped and in an assisted living care. She has Schizophrenia and is autistic. 
   
         Today when I got off work she texted me don't freak out but I'm dating! I asked why would I freak out she then tells me that she is talking to a 48 year old. What's going through my mind is what does a 48 year old wants to do with a 22 year old? I then ask when they've met and if he knows her condition. THEY'VE BEEN TALKING SINCE SHE WAS 16. I tell her it's not normal and I'm concerned. She says that he loves her,  that he's nothing but green flags and that I'm not understanding. He stopped talking to her until she was 18 and before when she was 16, it wasn't anything sexual. I tell her that any adult should not feel comfortable talking to an 16 year old unless they are their parent or its their job. I try to explain that even if he waited until she was 18 to talk to her, he should have blocked her and never contacted her again. She kept going on and on about how I was wrong and her therapist is an experienced and is educated on what grooming is and says their relationship is okay. Her therapist knows everything about the relationship and says they are nothing but green flags. How can a therapist say this is okay. I love my sister but she's getting so angry about it. So I decided if I keep giving it negative attention she's going to get closer to him. The group home has to see everyone that checked her out so she will be safe and if she's not back in time they'll call the cops. This is the text I sent her 
        ""I love you and I really just want to say I'm not okay with this relationship you have, I believe he had groomed you. 
I will not encourage or support this relationship. It's not normal that he is 48, it's not normal that he talked to you at 16 then waited til you were legal to contact you again. I will not be responding to anymore texts about him. I love you and I want what is best for you"" 
         She then defends it for 30 or ao texts it was hard not to respond I'm nervous for her. 
She's convinced it's okay and that her therapist is okay with it. Her group home is okay with it. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone how is everyone okay with this? I feel like a horrible person for not responding especially because she was excited to tell me about her dating and everyone seems to think it's okay.

during the past few months, lana became friends with noah through the gc. Unlike everyone else, we were friends with noah before, but lana, who is one of tifannys closest friends became friends with someone who openly dislikes her.

when just the 3 of us hang out, she mentioned that we bring up the gc too much when its very much well known she isnt in it. lana will say ‚Äúcheck the gc!‚Äù and she just sits there looking at our phones, and lana gets pissed at that
