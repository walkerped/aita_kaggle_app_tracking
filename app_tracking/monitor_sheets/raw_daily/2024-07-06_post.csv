0,1dwpnny,Update - AlTA for suggesting that my brother and his fiancée bring out a cake at midnight on their wedding day for our grandma's 80th birthday?,"The wedding is off. After the conflict between me and my brother's former fiancée, which resulted in a phone call from my brother, I decided to text her 3 days later to apologize. Even though my family and the internet sided with me, I just didn't want any bad mojo or to be a SIL from hell. My text was met with a lot of anger on my dad's behalf, which really surprised me because the man supports me no matter what. He was telling me how I shouldn't have been the one to apologize and he  let another thing slip out - end of February, the bride's dad asked my dad, in confidence, if he could pitch in additional money for his daughter's dream wedding because he didn't think it was fair he had to pay more due to tradition. My mom didn't know about this which prompted fight number one.



My dad was pissed that I was the one to apologize even though I was the one that was insulted, so he called my brother behind our backs and told him that he respects the fact that she will be his wife and his primary family, but how he also thinks he should've checked her for insulting me the same way he checked me for crossing a boundary. He then did what dads sometimes do best - go off with a monologue after keeping shit inside for months. He told him about the additional money that he gave and he told him he wasn't convinced the overlapping events were a coincidence. Fight number two ensued. My brother called our mom the next day to tell her the wedding was off, all hell broke loose. 



We then couldn't get in touch with my brother or his fiancée for almost a week. Her mom then got ahold of my work email and emailed me saying I had ruined her daughter's life. I forwarded the email to my brother and he finally called me back. He said it felt like she wanted to marry for the wedding, not for the marriage. She also admitted to making her dad ask our dad for more money so she could afford a wedding flower package she wanted that was an additional $7000, and she saw nothing wrong with keeping it a secret from my brother. She also refused to at least acknowledge my apology and to apologize back to me. My brother told her he would like to postpone the wedding and work on their issues and she ended up calling off the wedding and breaking up with him. 



My relationship with my brother is still a wreck, he said he needs time because he loves her but he understands she didn't prioritize him as much as he did her. Grandma's birthday bash is back on, and we're happy for her, she's excited as heck after the initial turmoil. I miss my brother so much and it sucks knowing how heartbroken he is, but at least he's talking to my parents and he has the rest of the family as his support system. I really hope we can rebuild our relationship someday. I'm glad he won't marry the wrong person for the wrong reasons, but it's awful being the trigger to his life falling apart and I regret everything.",UPDATE,2024-07-06,"Update - AlTA for suggesting that my brother and his fiancée bring out a cake at midnight on their wedding day for our grandma's 80th birthday?

1,1dwdq3w,AITA For telling my mom she makes me hate myself,"I (16F) told my mother she made me hate myself during an argument. This started a couple of days ago when my mother got upset over some things my dad had done (I think brushing her off when she was talking to him). Since then, she has treated me coldly and gets really upset over anything I do. I'm going to trying my best to not make this sound so one-sided since she tells me I play the victim card often. I don't want to make it seem like I'm just being a teenager who hates their parents either. I am not perfect, I make many mistakes as a daughter and have the right to be scolded by her. However, if I forget to do something like dusting my room or finding something she needs, she can get a bit explosive. She tends to call me insults in Spanish like p\*ndeja, which I can understand is normal in Latino households, but this really hurts me.

I've been diagnosed with depression, autism, and PTSD. I know this might sound like I'm actively trying to ""collect"" disorders but that's also not the case. I've struggled with being at home and interacting with people since very little. The other day what happened was I got up pretty late (around 10:30-ish) and went to the kitchen. I'm taking an online summer college class, which is sort of at your own pace. My mom asked me why I was there and not doing my work so I went back to my room to do some of it. Later I was yelled back into the kitchen to do chores, which was fine, but my mom was really mad at me for misinterpreting her question and not paying attention to the help they needed for chores. As I was trying to clean around, she would yell at me more than mock me for my reactions (I might tremble and stutter sometimes, I also cry easily). She started getting even more angry and telling me I was doing it all for attention from my dad, but I tried explaining to her that it wasn't about him and I couldn't control my reactions. Then I told her that she made me hate myself. I do have intense feelings of self-hatred. I've attempted multiple times and have hurt myself. Both my parents have mocked me for my scars, my mom threatening to hurt me if I did it again. She does this at times when I bring up something that's been hurting me and then she tells me something along the lines of ""Well should we just all kill ourselves?"". I don't know what to do, I feel like an awful person. I'm very grateful for the things my parents do, they clothe me, feed me, and keep a roof over my head. They drive me to school and to my friends' house. Many people have it way worse than I do. I just don't know if I'm in the wrong here or if I deserve it for the things I do wrong. My friend tells me this isn't normal, but I don't know if they're being biased. My mom says I hurt her with my attitude and responses (when I look scared).

2,1dwdkv4,AITA for asking my colleague to aim higher?,"I'm a 35M working in a marketing agency. A year ago, we had this guy join my team fresh out of college. He's a great guy, and seems very eager to make an impression. I like to have a very casual work style within my team and like to create an atmosphere where we can work hard and still have fun and be normal people around each other.

Anyway, a couple of days ago we had this company townhall where they announced his promotion. He gave a short speech where he thanked me and said he couldn't have asked for a better manager and that he hopes to be like me in 10 years. A bit cringe and I was also getting embarrassed so I jumped in with ""Thank you but please have higher standards"" A few people laughed including him and that was it.

Went home and told my wife this and she said I shouldn't have been such an asshole about it. She said I know that he's young and probably nervous and I made him feel even more conscious. From my side, I was serious about it because I really do hope he has bigger aspirations than to 'be like me' and I do have this self-deprecating style of humour, especially when I feel awkward. She said I need to stop making every situation about how I'm feeling and to think of others too.

4,1dwdexj,AITA for expecting my wife to close my switch game properly before switching game cards,"There is only 1 Nintendo Switch in the house, and it's shared between me, my wife, and 2 young kids. Normally me or my kids will have our gaming sessions, after which we just put the switch in sleep mode, mainly so we can resume the game on the next session. I assume that's the whole benefit of having a sleep feature in the first place.  
  
When it comes to switching game cartridges, I have told my kids multiple times they have to close the current game in the main menu first. The switch basically warns you as much if you were to pull the game card out without first closing it. The kids have been guilty of swapping cards without closing in the past, but for the last year or so they've been really good about it.  
So basically, only close the game in the main menu if there's a desire to switch a game cartridge.  
  
I have tried preaching this to my wife a few times, stating the onus is on whoever wants to switch games, to close the game. She wholly disagrees and says because the switch is a shared family privilege, the game must always be closed after each gaming session by whoever last played it.  
  
I feel she equates it to putting dishes into the dishwasher after you're done, which makes sense in the world of dishes....

5,1dwdd07,AITA for cancelling on trip plans that were made for me and my friends?,"Currently typing my first post from my hostel in Paris, France!

I wouldn't say im unhealthy, my boyfriend and I go to the gym regularly and I love a good walk especially if theres a view. But my friends friend has been adamant on walking to every site instead of taking the metro and we ended up walking 20k steps on the first day and 30k the next, something were not used to. The trip was very fast paced and a lot of us started to lag while my friend and her friend chatting it up way ahead of us.

Half of our group were tired and irritated from the first day and decided to do their own thing on the second. My BF and I decided to stay and see more sites with the main group. It was nice at first but we didn't get to look around at our leisure because our friends friend was adamant we keep going ahead so we could see everything.

I told her later that day I wasn't used to so much walking and she had said that her average steps were at least 30k so this was just an average day for her and that was that.

Now it's today. I ended up having a mild limp from how sore my feet and calves were and I was extremely fatigued at the beginning of the day.

7,1dwd9mx,AITA for putting my bf out my house after he quit his job to come live with me,"My bf and I are recently together. 6 months now. We connected right away. We live in the Netherlands but two hours apart. I was born here he lives here now almost 3 years. Due the war in Oekraïne he come here with his ex and daughter. He is originally from Nigeria.

My bf has lived in an old hospital for the whole time he has been here. First he didn’t told me his situation because when he was dating and told them they would leave him. I didn’t mind. He told me his situations with his ex. She left him when he was working and took his daughter with her to Germany. Let’s just say they have a toxic relationship. She often had treated him to send back to Nigeria, connect his whole family for money. Often has call the cops on him. He told me he is 38 wants a family now on is own and would like to stay in the Netherlands.

We got in a relationship in a month. I wanted to take things slower but because of his temporary residence permit he didn’t. He said we both know what we want and I never had someone like you. I helped him with his cv. Some paper work. Bought him clothes and shoes out of love. I been single for 6 years and have a daughter with my ex. At times it was hard being a single mom and I wanted a man I can lean on cus tired of doing everything by myself and he did step in. He did all the so called men work when he was here in the weekends. And most importantly very good with my daughter. My family and friend like him to but allso notice he is very stubborn. I am a Capricorn and he is so to. I am for sure stubborn too but i can see often things from an other pov he don’t. 
This came often to light. He is not long here in the Netherlands to know some of the rules or ways things go here and when I explain him things he sees it as an attack. Like when we asking for his tax back he said he is going to get back like around 5k I said I don’t think so , he said yes it’s so. At the end he needed to pay 2k. He also said I am not on the same page often with him but he thinks he knows everything even if he didn’t experience it before. He doesn’t have a driver’s licenses and cannot get it till he gets his citizenship. When I am driving he is committing on my driving and the rule but never had drive in his life before. I made him started the car once. First time in his 38 years of life.

3 months ago I found out I was pregnant. This was very quick but I see it as a blessing even though we had a lot of disagreement. When I asking and telling him things he sees it as an attack. He is used and grow up in a culture that the men should be the head of the household and I am with that. But he should learn the ways of living here first. He said he is here almost three years and knows everything he needs to know. But yet put cleaning stuff in the fridge. Don’t want a health insurance cus you have to pay that monthly. Been scammed cus he thought the bank was calling him for information.

He said he was going to quit his job so he can be with me and take care of me and my daughter. I helped him looked for a job here found one he would make a lots of money and was nearby. He didn’t want that one and was going to look for jobs when he was here in town by himself. I left him and he had interviews and took one he liked. I asked him for how many hours, how much he was going to get by hours, if it’s gross or net hours pay. He said I am always negative and attack him. I told him this are normal questions and I just like to be prepared there is a baby on the way. He should take it as an attack. He said I don’t need to be worried he is taking care of the finances. 

Since he stayed he had more small disagreement and I said it’s normal. We are shortly in a relationship. We don’t have to be on the same page on everything . We still are getting to know each other. He said I am manipulating him and try to lead him. That there can’t be two captains in this relationship. I don’t mind him leading but he doesn’t even has a boot so to say. I am the one to drive every were. He said he would do the household cleaning ect but only thing he can’t do is the cooking. Fine by me. But after some days the house was a mess and I did it by myself and he didn’t even help. I am very sick due the pregnancy and have low back pain. One night I told him you don’t help, you don’t talk you are just on your phone all day betting on sports. He said because every time he wants to talk I am fighting him. If something isn’t right I correct and told him he is not always right and not perfect, no one is. I am not perfect to. He said he is. And that I am manipulating him. I asked him with what ? He couldn’t give me an answer. 

Next morning I made my daughter ready for school and made myself a lovely breakfast. When he came downstairs he acted like nothing been said and everything is fine. Asking me if I made only myself breakfast as I respond of course last night you told me you don’t want to speak to me and I am manipulating you so. He said I need to be careful with my words cus a child is growing inside of me.  I asked him do you think this relationship would work, he said no. Cus everything is a fight. I said ok but I want to work on it but you don’t cus you think it’s nothing wrong with you and it’s all on me. Every time I point out something I don’t like he rubs it off like don’t worry or that not how a woman should be talking. I adjust a lot of things he don’t like out of the better and out of love. Less drinking stop smoking for example. When I asked him about his betting or accepting every on his social media it’s an attack. I told him it’s better for him to go back cus I don’t want to argue every day. I am pregnant and don’t want this in front of my daughter. He said he quit his job to be here and a baby is on the way. I told him a child will not hold me in a relationship. I will not be unhappy in my own house. This is not what I want but if he is not willing to work on it and knowledge my emotions and feelings it will not work. He is deflecting everything on me. He said because he is perfect and even Jesus would tell me this and that I am a wicked person. Before he left he recorded a video to explain why he leave this relationship and asking if when he call he can see his child if I would let him,I told him I am not your ex. If I give birth if he can be there ,Told him that’s up to him. If the baby going to get his last name, I said I would think about that as he respond well if the child doesn’t have my name I am not responsible for it and can do his job as a dad. AITA for putting my bf out my house after he quit his job to come live with me",TL;DR,2024-07-06,"AITA for putting my bf out my house after he quit his job to come live with me My bf and I are recently together. 6 months now. We connected right away. We live in the Netherlands but two hours apart. I was born here he lives here now almost 3 years. Due the war in Oekraïne he come here with his ex and daughter. He is originally from Nigeria.

My bf has lived in an old hospital for the whole time he has been here. First he didn’t told me his situation because when he was dating and told them they would leave him. I didn’t mind. He told me his situations with his ex. She left him when he was working and took his daughter with her to Germany. Let’s just say they have a toxic relationship. She often had treated him to send back to Nigeria, connect his whole family for money. Often has call the cops on him. He told me he is 38 wants a family now on is own and would like to stay in the Netherlands.

We got in a relationship in a month. I wanted to take things slower but because of his temporary residence permit he didn’t. He said we both know what we want and I never had someone like you. I helped him with his cv. Some paper work. Bought him clothes and shoes out of love. I been single for 6 years and have a daughter with my ex. At times it was hard being a single mom and I wanted a man I can lean on cus tired of doing everything by myself and he did step in. He did all the so called men work when he was here in the weekends. And most importantly very good with my daughter. My family and friend like him to but allso notice he is very stubborn. I am a Capricorn and he is so to. I am for sure stubborn too but i can see often things from an other pov he don’t. 
This came often to light. He is not long here in the Netherlands to know some of the rules or ways things go here and when I explain him things he sees it as an attack. Like when we asking for his tax back he said he is going to get back like around 5k I said I don’t think so , he said yes it’s so. At the end he needed to pay 2k. He also said I am not on the same page often with him but he thinks he knows everything even if he didn’t experience it before. He doesn’t have a driver’s licenses and cannot get it till he gets his citizenship. When I am driving he is committing on my driving and the rule but never had drive in his life before. I made him started the car once. First time in his 38 years of life.

3 months ago I found out I was pregnant. This was very quick but I see it as a blessing even though we had a lot of disagreement. When I asking and telling him things he sees it as an attack. He is used and grow up in a culture that the men should be the head of the household and I am with that. But he should learn the ways of living here first. He said he is here almost three years and knows everything he needs to know. But yet put cleaning stuff in the fridge. Don’t want a health insurance cus you have to pay that monthly. Been scammed cus he thought the bank was calling him for information.

He said he was going to quit his job so he can be with me and take care of me and my daughter. I helped him looked for a job here found one he would make a lots of money and was nearby. He didn’t want that one and was going to look for jobs when he was here in town by himself. I left him and he had interviews and took one he liked. I asked him for how many hours, how much he was going to get by hours, if it’s gross or net hours pay. He said I am always negative and attack him. I told him this are normal questions and I just like to be prepared there is a baby on the way. He should take it as an attack. He said I don’t need to be worried he is taking care of the finances. 

Since he stayed he had more small disagreement and I said it’s normal. We are shortly in a relationship. We don’t have to be on the same page on everything . We still are getting to know each other.

8,1dwd1k3,AITAH if i skip my 76 year old grandfather's birthday party to go play Magic the Gathering?,"A little bit of backstory: My grandfather has bullied everybody his entire life but manages to get away with it due to his wealth. He has been rude and abusive to me and my siblings since we were children. As soon as I was out of the house, I did everything I could to avoid him so I didn't have to suffer his insults and remarks. My mother has been bugging me to go to his 76th birthday party for months. I finally folded and agreed to go to his birthday party at a restaurant on the Friday of his birthday, the first week of August. I regretted it immediately but just started preparing to have a bad time, and come up with an excuse to dip out early. 

Things seemed a little weird when my mom wouldn't tell me exactly when the dinner would start or who might show up ( we have a big family so people can number in the dozens). I started asking around to other family members and learned from my aunt that the party wasn't on my grandfather's birthday but instead a week before. This wouldn't be a big deal except that my mother knows I'm not available that night or even weekend. She is dogsitting for me so I can go out of state to meet with some old friends who moved away.

A big event at my friend's local game store will last the entire weekend. I have already rented a hotel for this over a month ago. I have already spent hundreds of dollars and plan on spending more on little pieces of cardboard that bring me way too much happiness. My mother knew all this. She knows I haven't seen these friends in 5 years since they moved away and that this means a lot to me. She also knows how I feel about my grandfather. I have tried to talk to her about this many times, but I am told to tolerate him every time so that I can stay in the will. 

So, with this info, I called my mom to figure out what the hell was going on. She breaks immediately and tells me that my grandfather has been pressuring her to make me come hang out. She has been lying to him and refusing to tell him why I refuse to be around him. She claims that I went off to college or had the flu anytime I decided not to go to an event of his. She is in tears and demanding that I cancel all of my plans and help maintain her lie to a man I hate. I hate him because of this social environment he has forced onto this family. I have staunchly refused and will continue to do so. My mother has known that I have these plans for months and was not going to tell me until the last second to try and force me to help maintain her charade.

9,1dwcxw6,AITAH for calling my mother ableist even though she’s neurodivergent ,"To give some background, I have Audhd, but most of my family is neurodivergent as well. My aunt was visiting for the week so our house had been very noisy the past few days. As I was sitting in the living room I had put on noise canceling headphones because I was feeling overstimulated. While I was engaging with other family members my mother stopped the conversation and said how I should remove my headphones and actually participate with the family.

 I calmly explained that I wasn't listening to any music and was still talking to others, she stated that it feels like I'm disengaging. I understood where she's coming from and I tried to say that I understand but I need this to be able to interact with people right now. She ignored my words and sternly told me and I quote ""I'm trying to sound ableist, you aren't that far on the spectrum"". Which I shocked me because she knows that you don't have to be a certain level on the spectrum to be allowed to wear noise canceling headphones.

 I told that that's not how it works and she knows that, I did start to get more riled up after this to be granted. Here's where I called her ableist and the argument only escalated from there. After about five minutes of arguing I gave up and removed myself from the situation. It's been about a day and I still have not interacted with her, but she keeps shooting looks as if we're about to get a fist fight.

10,1dwcqje,"AITA for not saying ""I miss you too"" to my cousin? I am estranged from my mom and dads family.","Little background context, my mom left my dad and I when I was 7. My mom used me to cheat on my dad and my dad found out and basically still wanted to be with her(toxic) but she left him for her new man. Later, My dad had an intimate relationship with another of my cousins that started when I was around 9 yrs old. I have a brother due to the relationship they had and my brother is 3 yrs old. The cousin that sent me the I miss you message was through Snapchat. She sent me a selfie saying she misses me, then proceeds to send another selfie saying she might cry cause she misses me, then sends another selfie of her crying and said alright I did cry. This cousin I grew up with her. I knew about the relationship my dad and my other cousin had because I shared a room with my dad and that cousin was living with us. That cousin would sneak into the room and my dad and her would do the deed on the edge of the bed. The cousin I'm referring to in this post, I opened up to about the situation but she never asked how I felt/affected by the whole thing, I consider that relationship with the cousin as superficial. Now 2024 this cousin has 2 children. I do not hate my brother but recently due to mental health I went no contact with my dad's side of the family. So when my cousin sent that message I had a panic attack, I did not know how to answer so I just said ""aww thank you, I hope your doing okay"" she responded with ""I am I just miss you🥹"" and I responded with "" I am glad to hear your doing okay!"" And she responded with a ""😘"" face. I found out about my brother because the other cousin had sent me a picture she had just given birth to her son, I was shocked, I was hurt, I thought there relationship was over, my dad had told me it was. I was too trusting I confronted him when I was around 12 yrs old about the whole thing he was embarrassed and said he would end it(whole other thing in itself). We'll not even a month later they were back at getting intimate with eachother again. When I found out about my brother I called the cousin about the post and was crying and asking her if it was true and knew she said ""I have a child now and I can understand her, since I'm a mother"". Idk why I called her, I was hopeful she would finally be there for me. That is the jist of it. I couldn't force myself to fake it, I've faked it and people pleased them my whole life.... I can't not be hurt that no one in my dad's side of the family has ever asked me how I am doing after this whole situation went down and that my dad blamed me for my mom leaving and physically and emotionally abusing me after my mom left us. My aunt and uncle also lived in the same household and that cousin that had a relationship with my dad. My whole family knows what I have gone through in terms of abuse and the trauma I've gone through because of family but no one has ever been concerned if I'm really okay.
