0,1dwpnny,Update - AlTA for suggesting that my brother and his fiancée bring out a cake at midnight on their wedding day for our grandma's 80th birthday?,"The wedding is off. After the conflict between me and my brother's former fiancée, which resulted in a phone call from my brother, I decided to text her 3 days later to apologize. Even though my family and the internet sided with me, I just didn't want any bad mojo or to be a SIL from hell. My text was met with a lot of anger on my dad's behalf, which really surprised me because the man supports me no matter what. He was telling me how I shouldn't have been the one to apologize and he  let another thing slip out - end of February, the bride's dad asked my dad, in confidence, if he could pitch in additional money for his daughter's dream wedding because he didn't think it was fair he had to pay more due to tradition. My mom didn't know about this which prompted fight number one.



My dad was pissed that I was the one to apologize even though I was the one that was insulted, so he called my brother behind our backs and told him that he respects the fact that she will be his wife and his primary family, but how he also thinks he should've checked her for insulting me the same way he checked me for crossing a boundary. He then did what dads sometimes do best - go off with a monologue after keeping shit inside for months. He told him about the additional money that he gave and he told him he wasn't convinced the overlapping events were a coincidence. Fight number two ensued. My brother called our mom the next day to tell her the wedding was off, all hell broke loose. 



We then couldn't get in touch with my brother or his fiancée for almost a week. Her mom then got ahold of my work email and emailed me saying I had ruined her daughter's life. I forwarded the email to my brother and he finally called me back. He said it felt like she wanted to marry for the wedding, not for the marriage. She also admitted to making her dad ask our dad for more money so she could afford a wedding flower package she wanted that was an additional $7000, and she saw nothing wrong with keeping it a secret from my brother. She also refused to at least acknowledge my apology and to apologize back to me. My brother told her he would like to postpone the wedding and work on their issues and she ended up calling off the wedding and breaking up with him. 



My relationship with my brother is still a wreck, he said he needs time because he loves her but he understands she didn't prioritize him as much as he did her. Grandma's birthday bash is back on, and we're happy for her, she's excited as heck after the initial turmoil. I miss my brother so much and it sucks knowing how heartbroken he is, but at least he's talking to my parents and he has the rest of the family as his support system. I really hope we can rebuild our relationship someday. I'm glad he won't marry the wrong person for the wrong reasons, but it's awful being the trigger to his life falling apart and I regret everything.",UPDATE,2024-07-06,"Update - AlTA for suggesting that my brother and his fiancée bring out a cake at midnight on their wedding day for our grandma's 80th birthday?

1,1dwdq3w,AITA For telling my mom she makes me hate myself,"I (16F) told my mother she made me hate myself during an argument. This started a couple of days ago when my mother got upset over some things my dad had done (I think brushing her off when she was talking to him). Since then, she has treated me coldly and gets really upset over anything I do. I'm going to trying my best to not make this sound so one-sided since she tells me I play the victim card often. I don't want to make it seem like I'm just being a teenager who hates their parents either. I am not perfect, I make many mistakes as a daughter and have the right to be scolded by her. However, if I forget to do something like dusting my room or finding something she needs, she can get a bit explosive. She tends to call me insults in Spanish like p\*ndeja, which I can understand is normal in Latino households, but this really hurts me.

I've been diagnosed with depression, autism, and PTSD. I know this might sound like I'm actively trying to ""collect"" disorders but that's also not the case. I've struggled with being at home and interacting with people since very little. The other day what happened was I got up pretty late (around 10:30-ish) and went to the kitchen. I'm taking an online summer college class, which is sort of at your own pace. My mom asked me why I was there and not doing my work so I went back to my room to do some of it. Later I was yelled back into the kitchen to do chores, which was fine, but my mom was really mad at me for misinterpreting her question and not paying attention to the help they needed for chores. As I was trying to clean around, she would yell at me more than mock me for my reactions (I might tremble and stutter sometimes, I also cry easily). She started getting even more angry and telling me I was doing it all for attention from my dad, but I tried explaining to her that it wasn't about him and I couldn't control my reactions. Then I told her that she made me hate myself. I do have intense feelings of self-hatred. I've attempted multiple times and have hurt myself. Both my parents have mocked me for my scars, my mom threatening to hurt me if I did it again. She does this at times when I bring up something that's been hurting me and then she tells me something along the lines of ""Well should we just all kill ourselves?"". I don't know what to do, I feel like an awful person. I'm very grateful for the things my parents do, they clothe me, feed me, and keep a roof over my head. They drive me to school and to my friends' house. Many people have it way worse than I do. I just don't know if I'm in the wrong here or if I deserve it for the things I do wrong. My friend tells me this isn't normal, but I don't know if they're being biased. My mom says I hurt her with my attitude and responses (when I look scared).

2,1dwdkv4,AITA for asking my colleague to aim higher?,"I'm a 35M working in a marketing agency. A year ago, we had this guy join my team fresh out of college. He's a great guy, and seems very eager to make an impression. I like to have a very casual work style within my team and like to create an atmosphere where we can work hard and still have fun and be normal people around each other.

Anyway, a couple of days ago we had this company townhall where they announced his promotion. He gave a short speech where he thanked me and said he couldn't have asked for a better manager and that he hopes to be like me in 10 years. A bit cringe and I was also getting embarrassed so I jumped in with ""Thank you but please have higher standards"" A few people laughed including him and that was it.

Went home and told my wife this and she said I shouldn't have been such an asshole about it. She said I know that he's young and probably nervous and I made him feel even more conscious. From my side, I was serious about it because I really do hope he has bigger aspirations than to 'be like me' and I do have this self-deprecating style of humour, especially when I feel awkward. She said I need to stop making every situation about how I'm feeling and to think of others too.

4,1dwdexj,AITA for expecting my wife to close my switch game properly before switching game cards,"There is only 1 Nintendo Switch in the house, and it's shared between me, my wife, and 2 young kids. Normally me or my kids will have our gaming sessions, after which we just put the switch in sleep mode, mainly so we can resume the game on the next session. I assume that's the whole benefit of having a sleep feature in the first place.  
  
When it comes to switching game cartridges, I have told my kids multiple times they have to close the current game in the main menu first. The switch basically warns you as much if you were to pull the game card out without first closing it. The kids have been guilty of swapping cards without closing in the past, but for the last year or so they've been really good about it.  
So basically, only close the game in the main menu if there's a desire to switch a game cartridge.  
  
I have tried preaching this to my wife a few times, stating the onus is on whoever wants to switch games, to close the game. She wholly disagrees and says because the switch is a shared family privilege, the game must always be closed after each gaming session by whoever last played it.  
  
I feel she equates it to putting dishes into the dishwasher after you're done, which makes sense in the world of dishes....

5,1dwdd07,AITA for cancelling on trip plans that were made for me and my friends?,"Currently typing my first post from my hostel in Paris, France!

I wouldn't say im unhealthy, my boyfriend and I go to the gym regularly and I love a good walk especially if theres a view. But my friends friend has been adamant on walking to every site instead of taking the metro and we ended up walking 20k steps on the first day and 30k the next, something were not used to. The trip was very fast paced and a lot of us started to lag while my friend and her friend chatting it up way ahead of us.

Half of our group were tired and irritated from the first day and decided to do their own thing on the second. My BF and I decided to stay and see more sites with the main group. It was nice at first but we didn't get to look around at our leisure because our friends friend was adamant we keep going ahead so we could see everything.

I told her later that day I wasn't used to so much walking and she had said that her average steps were at least 30k so this was just an average day for her and that was that.

Now it's today. I ended up having a mild limp from how sore my feet and calves were and I was extremely fatigued at the beginning of the day.

7,1dwd9mx,AITA for putting my bf out my house after he quit his job to come live with me,"My bf and I are recently together. 6 months now. We connected right away. We live in the Netherlands but two hours apart. I was born here he lives here now almost 3 years. Due the war in Oekraïne he come here with his ex and daughter. He is originally from Nigeria.

My bf has lived in an old hospital for the whole time he has been here. First he didn’t told me his situation because when he was dating and told them they would leave him. I didn’t mind. He told me his situations with his ex. She left him when he was working and took his daughter with her to Germany. Let’s just say they have a toxic relationship. She often had treated him to send back to Nigeria, connect his whole family for money. Often has call the cops on him. He told me he is 38 wants a family now on is own and would like to stay in the Netherlands.

We got in a relationship in a month. I wanted to take things slower but because of his temporary residence permit he didn’t. He said we both know what we want and I never had someone like you. I helped him with his cv. Some paper work. Bought him clothes and shoes out of love. I been single for 6 years and have a daughter with my ex. At times it was hard being a single mom and I wanted a man I can lean on cus tired of doing everything by myself and he did step in. He did all the so called men work when he was here in the weekends. And most importantly very good with my daughter. My family and friend like him to but allso notice he is very stubborn. I am a Capricorn and he is so to. I am for sure stubborn too but i can see often things from an other pov he don’t. 
This came often to light. He is not long here in the Netherlands to know some of the rules or ways things go here and when I explain him things he sees it as an attack. Like when we asking for his tax back he said he is going to get back like around 5k I said I don’t think so , he said yes it’s so. At the end he needed to pay 2k. He also said I am not on the same page often with him but he thinks he knows everything even if he didn’t experience it before. He doesn’t have a driver’s licenses and cannot get it till he gets his citizenship. When I am driving he is committing on my driving and the rule but never had drive in his life before. I made him started the car once. First time in his 38 years of life.

3 months ago I found out I was pregnant. This was very quick but I see it as a blessing even though we had a lot of disagreement. When I asking and telling him things he sees it as an attack. He is used and grow up in a culture that the men should be the head of the household and I am with that. But he should learn the ways of living here first. He said he is here almost three years and knows everything he needs to know. But yet put cleaning stuff in the fridge. Don’t want a health insurance cus you have to pay that monthly. Been scammed cus he thought the bank was calling him for information.

He said he was going to quit his job so he can be with me and take care of me and my daughter. I helped him looked for a job here found one he would make a lots of money and was nearby. He didn’t want that one and was going to look for jobs when he was here in town by himself. I left him and he had interviews and took one he liked. I asked him for how many hours, how much he was going to get by hours, if it’s gross or net hours pay. He said I am always negative and attack him. I told him this are normal questions and I just like to be prepared there is a baby on the way. He should take it as an attack. He said I don’t need to be worried he is taking care of the finances. 

Since he stayed he had more small disagreement and I said it’s normal. We are shortly in a relationship. We don’t have to be on the same page on everything . We still are getting to know each other. He said I am manipulating him and try to lead him. That there can’t be two captains in this relationship. I don’t mind him leading but he doesn’t even has a boot so to say. I am the one to drive every were. He said he would do the household cleaning ect but only thing he can’t do is the cooking. Fine by me. But after some days the house was a mess and I did it by myself and he didn’t even help. I am very sick due the pregnancy and have low back pain. One night I told him you don’t help, you don’t talk you are just on your phone all day betting on sports. He said because every time he wants to talk I am fighting him. If something isn’t right I correct and told him he is not always right and not perfect, no one is. I am not perfect to. He said he is. And that I am manipulating him. I asked him with what ? He couldn’t give me an answer. 

Next morning I made my daughter ready for school and made myself a lovely breakfast. When he came downstairs he acted like nothing been said and everything is fine. Asking me if I made only myself breakfast as I respond of course last night you told me you don’t want to speak to me and I am manipulating you so. He said I need to be careful with my words cus a child is growing inside of me.  I asked him do you think this relationship would work, he said no. Cus everything is a fight. I said ok but I want to work on it but you don’t cus you think it’s nothing wrong with you and it’s all on me. Every time I point out something I don’t like he rubs it off like don’t worry or that not how a woman should be talking. I adjust a lot of things he don’t like out of the better and out of love. Less drinking stop smoking for example. When I asked him about his betting or accepting every on his social media it’s an attack. I told him it’s better for him to go back cus I don’t want to argue every day. I am pregnant and don’t want this in front of my daughter. He said he quit his job to be here and a baby is on the way. I told him a child will not hold me in a relationship. I will not be unhappy in my own house. This is not what I want but if he is not willing to work on it and knowledge my emotions and feelings it will not work. He is deflecting everything on me. He said because he is perfect and even Jesus would tell me this and that I am a wicked person. Before he left he recorded a video to explain why he leave this relationship and asking if when he call he can see his child if I would let him,I told him I am not your ex. If I give birth if he can be there ,Told him that’s up to him. If the baby going to get his last name, I said I would think about that as he respond well if the child doesn’t have my name I am not responsible for it and can do his job as a dad. AITA for putting my bf out my house after he quit his job to come live with me",TL;DR,2024-07-06,"AITA for putting my bf out my house after he quit his job to come live with me My bf and I are recently together. 6 months now. We connected right away. We live in the Netherlands but two hours apart. I was born here he lives here now almost 3 years. Due the war in Oekraïne he come here with his ex and daughter. He is originally from Nigeria.

My bf has lived in an old hospital for the whole time he has been here. First he didn’t told me his situation because when he was dating and told them they would leave him. I didn’t mind. He told me his situations with his ex. She left him when he was working and took his daughter with her to Germany. Let’s just say they have a toxic relationship. She often had treated him to send back to Nigeria, connect his whole family for money. Often has call the cops on him. He told me he is 38 wants a family now on is own and would like to stay in the Netherlands.

We got in a relationship in a month. I wanted to take things slower but because of his temporary residence permit he didn’t. He said we both know what we want and I never had someone like you. I helped him with his cv. Some paper work. Bought him clothes and shoes out of love. I been single for 6 years and have a daughter with my ex. At times it was hard being a single mom and I wanted a man I can lean on cus tired of doing everything by myself and he did step in. He did all the so called men work when he was here in the weekends. And most importantly very good with my daughter. My family and friend like him to but allso notice he is very stubborn. I am a Capricorn and he is so to. I am for sure stubborn too but i can see often things from an other pov he don’t. 
This came often to light. He is not long here in the Netherlands to know some of the rules or ways things go here and when I explain him things he sees it as an attack. Like when we asking for his tax back he said he is going to get back like around 5k I said I don’t think so , he said yes it’s so. At the end he needed to pay 2k. He also said I am not on the same page often with him but he thinks he knows everything even if he didn’t experience it before. He doesn’t have a driver’s licenses and cannot get it till he gets his citizenship. When I am driving he is committing on my driving and the rule but never had drive in his life before. I made him started the car once. First time in his 38 years of life.

3 months ago I found out I was pregnant. This was very quick but I see it as a blessing even though we had a lot of disagreement. When I asking and telling him things he sees it as an attack. He is used and grow up in a culture that the men should be the head of the household and I am with that. But he should learn the ways of living here first. He said he is here almost three years and knows everything he needs to know. But yet put cleaning stuff in the fridge. Don’t want a health insurance cus you have to pay that monthly. Been scammed cus he thought the bank was calling him for information.

He said he was going to quit his job so he can be with me and take care of me and my daughter. I helped him looked for a job here found one he would make a lots of money and was nearby. He didn’t want that one and was going to look for jobs when he was here in town by himself. I left him and he had interviews and took one he liked. I asked him for how many hours, how much he was going to get by hours, if it’s gross or net hours pay. He said I am always negative and attack him. I told him this are normal questions and I just like to be prepared there is a baby on the way. He should take it as an attack. He said I don’t need to be worried he is taking care of the finances. 

Since he stayed he had more small disagreement and I said it’s normal. We are shortly in a relationship. We don’t have to be on the same page on everything . We still are getting to know each other. He said I am manipulating him and try to lead him. That there can’t be two captains in this relationship. I don’t mind him leading but he doesn’t even has a boot so to say.

He has been rude and abusive to me and my siblings since we were children. As soon as I was out of the house, I did everything I could to avoid him so I didn't have to suffer his insults and remarks. My mother has been bugging me to go to his 76th birthday party for months. I finally folded and agreed to go to his birthday party at a restaurant on the Friday of his birthday, the first week of August. I regretted it immediately but just started preparing to have a bad time, and come up with an excuse to dip out early. 

Things seemed a little weird when my mom wouldn't tell me exactly when the dinner would start or who might show up ( we have a big family so people can number in the dozens). I started asking around to other family members and learned from my aunt that the party wasn't on my grandfather's birthday but instead a week before. This wouldn't be a big deal except that my mother knows I'm not available that night or even weekend. She is dogsitting for me so I can go out of state to meet with some old friends who moved away.

A big event at my friend's local game store will last the entire weekend. I have already rented a hotel for this over a month ago. I have already spent hundreds of dollars and plan on spending more on little pieces of cardboard that bring me way too much happiness. My mother knew all this. She knows I haven't seen these friends in 5 years since they moved away and that this means a lot to me. She also knows how I feel about my grandfather. I have tried to talk to her about this many times, but I am told to tolerate him every time so that I can stay in the will. 

So, with this info, I called my mom to figure out what the hell was going on. She breaks immediately and tells me that my grandfather has been pressuring her to make me come hang out. She has been lying to him and refusing to tell him why I refuse to be around him. She claims that I went off to college or had the flu anytime I decided not to go to an event of his. She is in tears and demanding that I cancel all of my plans and help maintain her lie to a man I hate. I hate him because of this social environment he has forced onto this family. I have staunchly refused and will continue to do so. My mother has known that I have these plans for months and was not going to tell me until the last second to try and force me to help maintain her charade.

9,1dwcxw6,AITAH for calling my mother ableist even though she’s neurodivergent ,"To give some background, I have Audhd, but most of my family is neurodivergent as well. My aunt was visiting for the week so our house had been very noisy the past few days. As I was sitting in the living room I had put on noise canceling headphones because I was feeling overstimulated. While I was engaging with other family members my mother stopped the conversation and said how I should remove my headphones and actually participate with the family.

 I calmly explained that I wasn't listening to any music and was still talking to others, she stated that it feels like I'm disengaging. I understood where she's coming from and I tried to say that I understand but I need this to be able to interact with people right now. She ignored my words and sternly told me and I quote ""I'm trying to sound ableist, you aren't that far on the spectrum"". Which I shocked me because she knows that you don't have to be a certain level on the spectrum to be allowed to wear noise canceling headphones.

 I told that that's not how it works and she knows that, I did start to get more riled up after this to be granted. Here's where I called her ableist and the argument only escalated from there. After about five minutes of arguing I gave up and removed myself from the situation.

10,1dwcqje,"AITA for not saying ""I miss you too"" to my cousin? I am estranged from my mom and dads family.","Little background context, my mom left my dad and I when I was 7. My mom used me to cheat on my dad and my dad found out and basically still wanted to be with her(toxic) but she left him for her new man. Later, My dad had an intimate relationship with another of my cousins that started when I was around 9 yrs old. I have a brother due to the relationship they had and my brother is 3 yrs old. The cousin that sent me the I miss you message was through Snapchat. She sent me a selfie saying she misses me, then proceeds to send another selfie saying she might cry cause she misses me, then sends another selfie of her crying and said alright I did cry. This cousin I grew up with her. I knew about the relationship my dad and my other cousin had because I shared a room with my dad and that cousin was living with us. That cousin would sneak into the room and my dad and her would do the deed on the edge of the bed. The cousin I'm referring to in this post, I opened up to about the situation but she never asked how I felt/affected by the whole thing, I consider that relationship with the cousin as superficial. Now 2024 this cousin has 2 children. I do not hate my brother but recently due to mental health I went no contact with my dad's side of the family. So when my cousin sent that message I had a panic attack, I did not know how to answer so I just said ""aww thank you, I hope your doing okay"" she responded with ""I am I just miss you🥹"" and I responded with "" I am glad to hear your doing okay!"" And she responded with a ""😘"" face. I found out about my brother because the other cousin had sent me a picture she had just given birth to her son, I was shocked, I was hurt, I thought there relationship was over, my dad had told me it was. I was too trusting I confronted him when I was around 12 yrs old about the whole thing he was embarrassed and said he would end it(whole other thing in itself). We'll not even a month later they were back at getting intimate with eachother again. When I found out about my brother I called the cousin about the post and was crying and asking her if it was true and knew she said ""I have a child now and I can understand her, since I'm a mother"". Idk why I called her, I was hopeful she would finally be there for me. That is the jist of it. I couldn't force myself to fake it, I've faked it and people pleased them my whole life.... I can't not be hurt that no one in my dad's side of the family has ever asked me how I am doing after this whole situation went down and that my dad blamed me for my mom leaving and physically and emotionally abusing me after my mom left us. My aunt and uncle also lived in the same household and that cousin that had a relationship with my dad. My whole family knows what I have gone through in terms of abuse and the trauma I've gone through because of family but no one has ever been concerned if I'm really okay.

12,1dx38v9,AITA for telling my roommates that their guest needs to sleep in their room?,"One of my roommates, Sydney, told someone that I don't know that they could come stay with us. The reason they said this is because that person's parents are abusive and was trying to get them out of a bad situation which I completely understand. However they didn't even tell me any of this, they just gave the person a key to my apartment. This person has been coming in at like midnight or after I go to bed and at the earliest leaving at 8am. I usually wake up at 5 or 6am and make breakfast and workout in the living room so I can watch TV quietly while my roommates are still sleeping.its been over a week since this person has started sleeping on our couch in the living room. I feel really uncomfortable being in the living room and kitchen area when she is sleeping in there. It's been becoming a problem especially when she was here until 2pm the other day and had her boyfriend over. Last night I was home alone because both of my roommates were working the night shift and this morning I woke up at 5:30 and she was asleep on the floor in our living room preventing me from working out or getting breakfast and i have no idea how she got in unless she has a key, which i feel like i should of known about. I texted them 2 times asking how long she was going to be here because I didn't know what the situation was but they left me on read and never talked to me about it. This morning I sent another message explaining that if she is going to keep sleeping here then she needs to sleep in one of their bedrooms instead of the living room because it is interfering with my daily life and neither of them asked me if it was okay. 
My roommate finally came and talked to me and basically said that since she is only sleeping here from midnight until 8am that I should just deal with it and that she wont care if I use the living room or kitchen while she is sleeping in there. However I usually move the coffee table and watch TV while I work out but can't do that if she is sleeping in the middle of the floor and there isn't enough space to do it around her and the coffee table. 
I understand she needs somewhere to stay so I feel like asking for her to sleep in one of their bedrooms is a good compromise especially since they didn't talk to me about it in the first place. However, when I talked to my roommates, they said that the person can't sleep in Trisha's room because she is packing to move out soon and can't sleep in Sydney's room because it's too dirty and they haven't had time to clean or even do laundry in a month. 
I don't feel like I am being irrational and i feel bad for the poor girl in the middle of this, but both of my roommates have been being kind of passive aggressive and talking in their room with the door closed so I can't hear them since the conversation and basically told me that it's too much for them to let her sleep in their bedroom instead.

I texted them 2 times asking how long she was going to be here because I didn't know what the situation was but they left me on read and never talked to me about it. This morning I sent another message explaining that if she is going to keep sleeping here then she needs to sleep in one of their bedrooms instead of the living room because it is interfering with my daily life and neither of them asked me if it was okay. 
My roommate finally came and talked to me and basically said that since she is only sleeping here from midnight until 8am that I should just deal with it and that she wont care if I use the living room or kitchen while she is sleeping in there. However I usually move the coffee table and watch TV while I work out but can't do that if she is sleeping in the middle of the floor and there isn't enough space to do it around her and the coffee table. 
I understand she needs somewhere to stay so I feel like asking for her to sleep in one of their bedrooms is a good compromise especially since they didn't talk to me about it in the first place. However, when I talked to my roommates, they said that the person can't sleep in Trisha's room because she is packing to move out soon and can't sleep in Sydney's room because it's too dirty and they haven't had time to clean or even do laundry in a month. 
I don't feel like I am being irrational and i feel bad for the poor girl in the middle of this, but both of my roommates have been being kind of passive aggressive and talking in their room with the door closed so I can't hear them since the conversation and basically told me that it's too much for them to let her sleep in their bedroom instead. So am I the asshole?",0.0,0.04725994914770126,0,1

15,1dx2w79,AITA for kicking my step daughter out?,"My husband and I are happily married and have one child together. He has one daughter from a previous relationship. We get along great with his ex and her husband. They weren't together long as they were lifelong friends who briefly tried dating and realized they were better as friends, even after the birth of their daughter.

Everyone gets along with the exception of their daughter, who really doesn't get along with anyone. She stayed with her aunt and when she left a couple weeks later, her cousin had to start therapy. The aunt went low contact with all of us. Her grandmother stopped having her for more than a couple days because her blood pressure can't take it.  She's been in therapy, asked if something has happened to her, but she is just defiant. She has been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder.

Her mother and step father have started therapy because of the constant stress of having her around. We told them that of course we would have her stay with us. 

It's been miserable. She goes out of her way to do the opposite of what anyone asks her to do. Refuses to do basic chores i.e. picking up her own trash and dirty clothes. We gave her the household chore of vacuuming once a day in the three rooms that have carpet. It takes maybe fifteen minutes. We found out she ""traded"" our son then complained when she was caught that it wasn't fair he got the easier job of watering two plants. We told her that not only is he only 8 yo but he is developmentally delayed and has muscular dystrophy and can barely push the vacuum. Not only that but he's nonverbal and couldn't tell her no. He just did as he was told.

The last straw was when I went into her room to put clothes away and noticed her pile of leftover food and wrappers. Id told her multiple times it needed thrown away. I decided to do it that time because it was starting to mold and she would lose food in her room privileges. I picked it up and there were a couple roaches. We called an exterminator and he said, they were only in her room and we were lucky to find it early and it most likely happened because instead of throwing her trash away, she just threw it out the window and left the window open. 

My husband says we shouldn't have kicked her out because now resents us and feels like we are giving up on her. I said I understood that as a parent but at what point does she have to stop making all of us miserable? Besides I think the best thing is to finally make her take some responsibility for herself and despite efforts with therapy, attempted quality time, punishments, encouragements, he is just enabling her at this point. Ultimately, I purchased the house prior to marriage and it's still in my name. I refuse to have my son live with someone who will take advantage of him and live in a house with roaches and mold. My husband and I are starting therapy soon for ourselves as well because of this and she is staying with the second friend because the first made her leave.

19,1dx29tt,AITA for telling him 'no' ,"There was a friend of mine that I had been helping out. He was going through a rough time and homeless (we were friends before he became homeless), so I allowed him to crash at my place, shower, do laundry etc. Over a period of about 6 months or so we became very close and spent time together regularly. We were basically in a relationship without the label, and I was perfectly fine with that. 

During a recent conversation, it became readily apparent that my feelings for him were much stronger than his for me. I knew at that moment that I would have to take a step back and distance myself because we were never going to be a long-term 'forever' sort of relationship (he had goals and dreams that didn't align with my wants and needs). I was aware of the 'expiration date' from the get-go, but the feelings really caught me off guard. I asked him for some space. 

The following day, I still felt the same way as I did the previous one and I knew I still had some things to sort out within myself. I told him he could stop by to grab some things (clothes, personal belongings, shower stuff etc.). When he got here, I was quite emotional because I knew that not only would I have to terminate the 'relationship' with him, but also take a step back from the friendship portion as well. I was crying, but calm and quiet. He asked if he could shower, but I said no, not right now. He then asked me if he could turn on the PC to do something, and I also said no and said that I needed some space. He appeared to understand, grabbed his belongings, and left. 

The next day, however, things took a massive turn for the worst. We ended up in a fight and he immediately threw the fact that I wouldn't allow him to shower in my face. He said that it was abusive of me to revoke resources like that from somebody in need. At that point I was entirely frustrated because I knew that he had another means to shower, so my home wasn't his last and only option. I had said to him that he was not entitled to my home in that way and that I needed space and I was going to take the time that I needed. I provided him with clean clothes and everything he needed to shower. I knew he had a gym membership.

I texted her today to ask if she was with her in laws, which she said yes because she was feeling better. I then texted her back that i felt sad by that she did not make an attempt to then catch up on my bday. she said that i was an entitiled asshole brat because this weekend had been planned already so how could she not show up to this? also that i was a leech to my parents for always asking them for stuff and going to dinner at my parents once every few weeks.

She is in her final year of her masters degree, but has not been to class or done anything since January. Why she doesnt want to say. She has struggled with a year of depression in 2018 when she got into a big car accident which was caused by her borderline alcoholic behavior in the months prior which she has fully recoverd from. My parents pay her entire tution and insurance. My sister lives with her boyfriend (M32) of 6 years. She does not pay any rent or ultitlities but does receive a full scholarship.

My sister prefers her in laws because they 'do not ask difficult questions about the more serious stuff. My family is) are always very sharp and pick up on these things and discuss this. Or at least thats how we were raised. Ever since she got with her BF she started to distance herself more and more from us in regards to wanting to talk to us about whats going on.

24,1dx1iry,AITA for inviting the American exchange student to a group activity with people who refused to speak English?,"So today I went to a friend's outing and invited an american guest student that has been staying here for 4 weeks to join. The friend group at the outing did not switch to English (apart from a few polite attempts at conversation) and when we all parted ways, the guest student told me that she'd had a bad time and found the group extemely rude. I apologized to the student and explained that I'd tried to start several conversations in English, but didn't want to force it, when clearly the group switched back to German every time.

For context:

We are in Germany. Everyone in the group speaks English, but not as confidently as they speak their native language.

I introduced the guest student to everyone and started conversations in English at several points throughout the evening.

It's only a short term stay, and in the 4 out of 6 weeks the student has been staying here, they've only twice come to our school. We've been texting back and forth for a while and I invited them in an attempt to engage them a little more.

The guest student is 32 while most of the group is somewhat younger (I'm not sure how this plays into the situation exactly, but the guest student asked me their age).

My personal leaning is >!that everyone could have tried harder in this situation. I could have openly asked the group to speak English (although I'm not sure why they should feel obligated to listen to me), the group could have asked more questions in English, and the guest student could have relied less on me to engage with others, maybe start a conversation autonomously and maybe also respect that people won't automatically stop speaking their native language just because there is an American in the room. I have visited families and countries in which I did not understand the language at all, and I always respected when people got tired of speaking a non-native language just for me - although I admit feeling bored sometimes when that happened.

My sister has always been a little bit entitled and definitely the favorite child, growing up she would generally get much more than I would (for context we are a pretty poor family), more gifts, more clothes, more pocket money, and just in general had everything that I would want. 

For the past 2 years she's been studying in university in another country, and she does nothing other than spend money and enjoy life. She goes for weeks without contacting my parents which they get very worried about, her course load is essentially 0 as she deferred many classes. She has not gotten a job for the past 2 years, and every time my parents ask her, she always responds, ""that she's been looking but she can't find anything"" which I find a little hard to believe. My mother despite being extremely mad at her laziness still gives her $700 a month out of my child benefit money (least I think not 100% sure) for living.

I've always been quite conservative my whole life and doing everything I can to help my parents and to not be a burden. I would work if I legally could, but I can't until next year (where I will be looking into a part time technical support job). I just feel like my sister is not doing her best to try to ease the burden of life off my parents, as we definitely struggling financially yet they still provide her with money and support. Her relationship with my father is terrible, my father sometimes says that she's dead to him (although he still cares for her a lot). And my mother loves her very much, much more than she ever loved me, and my sister takes it for granted and does nothing to support the family.

I wish I could tell her to get her shit together, however if I do that, she will just ignore me, and I don't really want to ruin our relationship. I wish my parents would take some action and maybe cut her off for a little bit, but I don't think they would do that for a long time.

26,1dx19zq,AITA for putting a seat cover on?,"Recently I (28f) have moved into a self contained flat underneath my parents house while I move states and find a house to purchase of my own which I’m expecting will take a few months total. The flat is unused as they have spare bedrooms upstairs for guests but I’m really grateful for being able to stay somewhere in this transitional phase. 

They have said they don’t want rent but just to pay all the power bills which I’m happy to do. 

There is some old furniture in the flat and I have brought some of my own. There are some old mid century type lounge chairs -  the type with a wooden frame and arms and two upholstered seat and back cushions. They have old bright green covers which are stained and faded but otherwise the chairs look great. I asked if I could make some white  covers to go over them on my sewing machine and my mother said yes so I bought $100 of non refundable material whilst I was shopping with her. I get to work and my father comes down and is irate telling me to stop and that they’re his chairs, it cost him money in the 80s for the green covers, he wants them green and that it’s not my house and to leave if I don’t like it. I’m obviously confused, annoyed and angry at this point. My mother comes down and sides with him. 

Important info: the covers I was making are just simple zip up covers that go on over the existing covers - so they can come on and off like a pillow case if that makes sense. The chairs were completely unused, and they don’t want them in the other part of the house. 

I’m not happy as I was told I could do this, spend the money, cut the material and started the project and now it’s all wasted. I said this and I’ve been told it their house their rules. Now things are tense.

I am not rich by any means, but I luckily inherited an apartment in my early 20’s, so I’m not so poor that I can’t afford to splurge for a night if I spend a few months saving for it since I don’t pay NYC levels of rent. Which I do a few times a year, this time I had my eyes on a pretty exclusive restaurant. For example, I made the reservations for two in January. I didn’t have a girlfriend or intend on making a date out of this when I made the reservation. Just wanted to casually have fun and enjoy the food and drinks. 

A few weeks ago, I got a text reminder about my upcoming reservation, and I invited my gf who I’ve now been seeing for 5 months. She asked where the reservation was for, I told her, and she said it was too expensive. I told her of course it was on my dime, and she still said no, that it was too expensive, she would feel too bad if I spent that much money on her. For the third and final time, I asked her, told her I was paying and WANTED to pay for her, and she said no. I asked a few friends and they all had plans or weren’t interested, and then decided I would take my baby brother. So the day of, we got dressed to the 9’s, we went to our reservation. Afterwards, we went to a fancy hotel and swam around in the pool, walked around the city at 3AM, just having fun. Honestly, it was one of the best nights of my life just being a big kid with adult money with my baby brother. 



And I told my girlfriend that verbatim when I got back to my apartment the next morning (she stayed the night with our shared cat). I didn’t think I did anything wrong initially, but she started bawling her eyes out REALLY heavily and telling me I had no idea how sad it was for her that I went out and had the time of my life while she was alone in my apartment. I asked why she was feeling so sad about it and she said she thought I was planning something major and romantic, and that she was disappointed that I didn’t try harder to get her to go. I didn’t know what to do so I apologized but reminded her firmly that I invited her multiple times, and she said she really wanted to go but that she just felt bad that she couldn’t pay for herself. I told her that sounds really immature. If I offer to do something and say I want to do it, and you say no, I don’t think it’s cool to cry to me about how much you wanted to go. I tried to explain this to her but she just cried harder. I don’t know what to do. She has NEVER acted like this, we don’t argue at all.

I mean, I love her, I am really deeply in love with this girl, and I’m wondering if I handled anything about this the wrong way or insensitively.

I asked why she was feeling so sad about it and she said she thought I was planning something major and romantic, and that she was disappointed that I didn’t try harder to get her to go. I didn’t know what to do so I apologized but reminded her firmly that I invited her multiple times, and she said she really wanted to go but that she just felt bad that she couldn’t pay for herself. I told her that sounds really immature. If I offer to do something and say I want to do it, and you say no, I don’t think it’s cool to cry to me about how much you wanted to go. I tried to explain this to her but she just cried harder. I don’t know what to do. She has NEVER acted like this, we don’t argue at all. This is the healthiest relationship that I’ve ever seen or been in. I mean, I love her, I am really deeply in love with this girl, and I’m wondering if I handled anything about this the wrong way or insensitively. I told her that she was 100000% invited on my next excursion and she said she would “think about it” but that this ruined the idea of her going on one with me. ",0.0,1.0452779531478882,1,0
30,1dx0e71,AITA for not telling my mom I opted into gender inclusive housing for college?,"I'm writing this at a pretty low point so bare with me, if anything isn't clear I'm happy to clarify in the comments. 

I, (18 M) am going to college in August. I'm queer, and identify as bi, my mother knows this and hasn't been the most supportive about it but hasn't been outright homophobic. I generally feel very comfortable with people in the queer space and so I opted into gender inclusive housing so I knew I'd be accepted by the people I'm rooming with. I didn't tell my mom because I didn't think it would even be an issue, as in recent months she's been more accepting of my sexuality and the transgender community.

  
Last night, I came home from spending the day with friends, and my mom immediately called me over and asked ""So what is this about the ""gender justice housing."" I plainly explained to her ""oh, that just means that I have transgender roommates, is there a problem?"" She got extremely upset, and said ""I accept everybody, gay black, transgender, whatever, but we need to know about this so we can prepare."" I asked her multiple times ""prepare for what?"" and she never gave a direct answer. She started telling me how my family has never made me feel not accepted, and continued to talk about how we needed to tell them so they could prepare. This back and forth kept going until she just said ""I'm done"" and so I went back to my room.

  
I texted her a few hours ago asking her if she'd be willing to talk today or if she needed more time, to which she responded ""I feel completely deceived by you. I don't know when or if I'll be ready.""

  
From my perspective, it feels like this mostly comes down to bigotry on her part, as she had no need to prepare for anything when she thought my roommates were cis, but I also never got clarification on any of her concerns so it's left me feeling like maybe I'm missing something obvious and I really am the asshole.

There will be a tldr at the end most likely. Anyway I’m an aviation enthusiast. I ask details about planes and flights my friends go on. I’m not annoying about it either. I know because I have been and I can tell the difference. 

So backstory as summed up as I can: 
My friend and I playing Bopl Battles at his place I’m doing 4 player online. He watches. He’s an anime kid. The kind who cares more about that than actual people. Some dude has an anime profile picture and he sees it and starts rooting for him. I do not care of course but I find it pretty damn strange that he’s not helping me cuz I’m not very good and he usually would do that. Pretty cult like if you ask me. 

Then he goes on a flight and I ask him the 2 questions. I mistakenly do this in a group chat. 2 others. One doesn’t ever check or say anything. The other does. He is usually nice but he can be pretty damn rude and nasty. 

He sees my questions and asks me (while using foul language) why I would care, who cares, why am I asking. That kind of stuff. I tell him to mind his own business. Then the main guy joins him and says that it’s annoying (yeah no, believe me or not, but he’s overreacting, considering others have been way more tolerant to twice the amount of questions). Then he says my “obsession with planes is cult like”. Now he’s a total idiot who doesn’t know what a cult is apparently. 

Me asking a few questions about my interests, for myself, gets attacked by a dude who somehow hasn’t figured out that some people are aviation enthusiasts, then gets double teamed by some guy who is super arrogant and calls me cult like despite only caring about anime and anything related.

33,1dwziqb,AITA my wife wants me to apologize because she got offended by a song that the band nor I indented to be malicious.,"TLDR: My wife wants me to apologize because she became offended at me playing ""Smack my B*tch up"" by The Prodigy, and I said no.

My wife and I were having a heated conversation about another friend and a former friend of hers. In the process, she explained that she didn't care about what was going on with them. I was triggered by this, took a moment to regulate my emotions before continuing any conversation, and shared this intention with her.
 
I changed the music, avoiding DMX (too aggressive in the moment), Fallout Boy (already listened earlier today), Masego (I hyperfixated on it earlier in the week) ....oooh The Prodigy! It's been a min, and I LOVE  ""The Fat of the Land,"" and I used this album to channel emotions in a healthy way before. Why not now? Midway into the song, she asked why I put on THIS song. I explained my thoughts and reasoning, though she felt it was a subliminal shot at her. I explained that's not who I am as a person, and since adulthood have always interpreted the song as addressing an obstacle and changing strategy to overcome it, or change how it affects me, nothing more.
 
I explained this, throughly 4 times, I offered to look it up for her, which she refused then did for herself and CONFIRMED IT FOR HERSELF that the group felt  the same.  ...She then doubled down on needing an apology.  In our relationship, she has exhibited a history of emotional disregulation, some of which I was responsible for in the beginning of our relationship,  which I've taken therapeutic intervention to address and course correct. She has also, though her progress is less pronounced. I expressed that the apology would feel to me like I'm taking responsibility for something I had no control of again, and as a recovering people pleaser, I won't take responsibility for something I can't control(her emotions).
She didn't change her stance, and I chose to walk away until I could resolve my own upset and not escalate. 

So am I the asshole here??

[Edit and Update]: I appreciate the feedback received and would like to respond to some things I felt were clear but may not be.

1. I didn't select that song specifically, I chose the album.  The app i use resumed where it last was in that playlist queue, which happened to be in that song, and already 40 seconds in. I want to be clear, I wanted to hear the album,  not necessarily that song. 

2. We had a conversation about the album as a whole and how I consumed that media over time. I listened to her perspective,  feelings, and her interpretation. We discussed the creators intention and how it could be taken. I made sure she knew I'm not trying to invalidate her feelings and that I wanted her to feel safe, and I realized my part in disturbing that. We discussed how we can share our feelings without assuming the worst intentions. (We also made comparisons to music she prefers, and I understand the intention even if I don't agree with how the song(s) are presented.) I expressed that I did something that didn't make her feel safe, and that is a shared responsibility and I apologized for my part in that.

She apologized that she assumed intent even after it was made clear that what she based the upset upon was inaccurate. She just wanted it over so we could spend connective time together.

We spoke in length on what was creating the strain on her to make this such a big thing. She was overwhelmed and over stimulated and wanted reassurance, support, and pleasant distractions... and we were arguing about things that were important but not urgent. I shared that I had the same needs, and I felt she was slipping back into outsourcing her emotional labor, and simultaneously not taking accountability for her emotions and resulying destructive  behavior, which was a major issue in our relationship, but a consistent issue in all of her relationships, mainly because of her upbringing and childhood traumas.

3. When I left, it was specifically because it had escalated into an argument, and she was raising her voice, but not yelling, and we were now outside the car. I am tall and a large man, & am painfully aware of how my presence affects people, and I chose to deescalate quickly and safely and I walked to the restaurant next to our destination, where we were parked at. I gave her the keys. I would not leave her stranded. I let her know I wasn't leaving the area and would be close by, and I needed to create space  to sort my own upset out, constructively. I found out after the fact that she was doing the same in that time. 

4. We did continue our original plans and spoke about the ins and outs for about an hour and a half the next day and cleared up the confusion and miscommunications.

5. The conflict earlier was about friends I have that are taking advantage of me via emotional & physical l labor and how I'm not comfortable with it anymore and am distancing myself from them. A task I was already involved with them on was underway, and I was updating my wife about why I was delayed in an unrelated earlier task, as one of them had a minor medical emergency. My wife was trying to express that I'm not obligated to be that friends caretaker since they're a capable adult and that it's not a priority & not our problem. It was faster to say, ""I don't care about that.""  I took it at face value and didn't probe and ask her to elucidate on that. That was my fault.

 There have been several minor boundary issues with these friends and her over time, resulting in my wife choosing to step back from them all together for her own peace. I'm closer with them and have a different connection to them, but I have noticed they can be overwhelmingly negative at times, and it is extremely taxing to navigate and takes a long time to energetically recover from. This sis something I've shared over time, and they haven't made significant changes,  so I'm making myself less available.

This update is long, and I need to get back to work, so I'm going to end. It here for now.

I appreciate the support and clarity you all have shared. Thank-you 

For those who shared concern about my wife, I fully understand and am grateful for your feedback and suggestions. We've already set a time for sensory relaxation for her, and as of this writing, she's enjoying extra cuddles and support. Oh, and the cute pet related videos were lovely, and she's soaking them in! 

Please keep them coming!! 🥰

34,1dwz7j6,AITA for telling my mom how I felt?,"So, I am a minor who is trans masc, and me and my stepdad (49m) have always had a rocky relationship, but this year has been worse for a multitude of reasons. Mainly being FtM and in the first few months of me being out, I was really pushy about being called a boy and often referred to myself as a man. I will admit that during that time I was really an asshole to my mother.

His youngest son, Jay (Not his real name), did something I won't talk about on here because its not related to my story, and he died a few years ago. Apparently, his nickname was Macaroni Salad.

Last year, I started to go by Mak, and one of the nicknames my friends gave me was Makaroni/Mak and Cheese.

This year, my stepdad got really upset that I went by that name and told me I was dead to him as long as I went by that name, so I've changed it.

Now to the part I'm probably the asshole for.

On the fourth of July, my family met up at my grandparents house for some traditional American stuff. Well, cut to when fireworks were going off. I got overwhelmed and went to sit inside with my cousin's dog for a few minutes, which my mom (49f) said was okay.

Well, my stepdad came in to use the bathroom and told me to either put my phone down or come outside, and I wasn't ready to go back out yet, so I complied with what he asked me to do. When he came back out, he berated me and said I was giving an excuse for why I didn't want to spend time with my family.

I felt like he was guilt tripping me, so I went back outside but I was upset so I sent him an angry text, which my mom and him saw. He got pissed, walked over to my mom's car, and threw one of our chairs at a tree. He then came over to me and berated me. My mother was coming over and seperated us as I had a mini panic attack

My family went inside a few minutes later as it was almost 2200 (or 10 pm) and we had little boys with us for the first time in years. I was standing outside with the boys because I didn't want them to be unsupervised, even if it was just the front porch.

I hear my mom's car door open and see my stepdad walking away, so I tell my mom.

We pick him up a few blocks away from my grandparents.

On the way home, they are arguing, and I text my mom that I'm tired of feeling like I have to be perfect for him.

Today when I got off work, I was doing my chores and he has the windex/zep, which I need, so I ask him if I can use it and he asks me to just leave him alone.

So I grab it, not knowing that anything was wrong, and he yelled at me to just fucking put it down.

35,1dwz0dl,WIBTA for not going to my brothers wedding,"WIBTA for not wanting to go the my oldest brothers wedding. I (18 NB) am nonbinary and have set many boundaries regarding my gender identity, which are often loosely followed by my family as the only trans person so some mean more to me than others, particularly in how I present myself. My brother (21M) and his fiance (22F) had contacted our mom, as I still live at home, about wedding plans. There had been plans for fiance to ask me to be a brides maid, which has yet to happen in over a year, possibly 2, with their wedding set for next fall. Fiance had never asked me but I was made aware by my mom that it was planned. My brother text my mom to talk about that exact plan, without even being asked to be part of the wedding party, he was insisting that I wear a dress, one thing I absolutely refuse to do for my own comfort and they have been shown many options that can work if they want to include me without changing the style. I believe it's important to mention how he went to talk to our mom about this rather than directly to me, only to later say that she fights to many battles for me when he never tried to talk to me. My mom understands my boundaries for this because I have been clear in my identity for the past 4+ years and have never wavered on how I feel in my own body. It should also be noted that a lot of this was because of my identity, regardless of him saying that he isn't transphobic his actions have constantly said otherwise. The beginning of his discussion was in part to others he wanted to invite to his wedding and how I would make them uncomfortable and shove my views in their face, also saying he had to uninvite another trans friend of his for to the wedding. To me it seems clear the people who would be uncomfortable with me being there are the problem but he is adamant that I am currently the Problem. I have set my foot down with my boundaries and fiance had later tried to message me about it. She had said that she has a vision for her wedding and doesn't want to change it, but based on that it seems that her vision truly doesn't account for how I am. I didn't really get an apology of them trying to force me to do something I am not comfortable with but rather they tried to guilt me because it's their wedding day.

WIBTA?",Asshole POO Mode,2024-07-06,"WIBTA for not going to my brothers wedding WIBTA for not wanting to go the my oldest brothers wedding. I (18 NB) am nonbinary and have set many boundaries regarding my gender identity, which are often loosely followed by my family as the only trans person so some mean more to me than others, particularly in how I present myself. My brother (21M) and his fiance (22F) had contacted our mom, as I still live at home, about wedding plans. There had been plans for fiance to ask me to be a brides maid, which has yet to happen in over a year, possibly 2, with their wedding set for next fall. Fiance had never asked me but I was made aware by my mom that it was planned. My brother text my mom to talk about that exact plan, without even being asked to be part of the wedding party, he was insisting that I wear a dress, one thing I absolutely refuse to do for my own comfort and they have been shown many options that can work if they want to include me without changing the style. I believe it's important to mention how he went to talk to our mom about this rather than directly to me, only to later say that she fights to many battles for me when he never tried to talk to me. My mom understands my boundaries for this because I have been clear in my identity for the past 4+ years and have never wavered on how I feel in my own body. It should also be noted that a lot of this was because of my identity, regardless of him saying that he isn't transphobic his actions have constantly said otherwise. The beginning of his discussion was in part to others he wanted to invite to his wedding and how I would make them uncomfortable and shove my views in their face, also saying he had to uninvite another trans friend of his for to the wedding. To me it seems clear the people who would be uncomfortable with me being there are the problem but he is adamant that I am currently the Problem. I have set my foot down with my boundaries and fiance had later tried to message me about it. She had said that she has a vision for her wedding and doesn't want to change it, but based on that it seems that her vision truly doesn't account for how I am. I didn't really get an apology of them trying to force me to do something I am not comfortable with but rather they tried to guilt me because it's their wedding day.

I have a 2 year old and he’s not picky at all and really enjoyed eating the crab. My IL got my son a bib and little crab hat. My mom and sister have always been judgmental about my husband’s family lifestyle. I ate most grilled cheese and cut up hotdogs at that age. I was also always forced to order from the kids menu past the time I should have in order to save money. My mom had the idea of children’s food vs adult food so I wasn’t allowed to eat anything she would call fancy. 

My husband was brought up different and he was allowed to eat whatever his parents eat. His mom made one meal for all. So he could have steak, crab, and lobster if the adults were. 

My MIL took many cute videos of my toddler because it is her first grandchild and she was having a kick feeding him crab. Both had an amazing time. My MIL posted her videos and my sister shared them saying how it wrong to spoil toddler that age and posted it in her mom group for thrifty moms  shaming me.  My mom also had a lot of comments about it and blocked my husband and I from seeing it. She did not block my MIL and she saw it and was angry at my sister for speaking about her grandbaby like that. My sister and her child has a birthday coming up next week and my husband refuses to or let me take out son. I decided not to go either after this. My mom and sister thinks I should get over it. The thing is my husband and I was paying for the cake because both my mom and sisters are broke. He is now refusing to do that or get my nephew anything.

38,1dwy8kz,AITA for yelling at my dad and grandparents for standing by my older half siblings over me?,"I'm (16m) an affair baby. My dad's first wife was terminally ill and he had an affair with my mom throughout the two years of her life and I was the result of that, born just after she died. My parents got married a month later and divorced filed for divorce 4 months later and dad got custody of me. Dad's kids from his first wife hated me. They hated him too. But they despised me. They called me disgusting, said I should never have been born, they told me they wished I could have died instead of their mom. It was awful. They were 11 and 12 years older than me so old enough to be aware of what dad did and old enough to really hate me.

Dad married for a third time when I was 5 and he had three more kids with my stepmom. My half siblings cut contact with us BUT we would see them at our grandparents house sometimes and they used to be nicer, though not loving exactly, to my younger half siblings. They would always make sure I could see them treating them better too. My stepmom would brush me off if I mentioned how they treated me. Dad did nothing and my grandparents used to scold me for not spending time with all my siblings during family holidays and stuff, which is when we saw them most frequently. If I mentioned why I was isolated they would tell me it was all in my head.

I had some really fucked up self esteem issues for a while. I also know my family treated me like it was no big deal because I'm a guy and if I'd been a girl I can almost guarantee my feelings would have mattered more to my dad and grandparents.

So the yelling thing happened two weeks ago. We were all gathered to celebrate my grandma's birthday. All the extended family were together and grandma wanted a photo of all her grandkids and great grandkids (she has a few, including from one of my half siblings). My older half siblings said they refused to be in a photo with me and refused to have their kids be in a photo with me and asked grandma if she really wanted a disgusting affair baby in the photo. Grandma was like of course, we're all her grandkids. One of my younger half siblings asked what that and one of my older half siblings told them dad cheated on their mom and had me while their mom was dying and it made me disgusting.

I was still expected to get in the photo. I looked to my dad and my grandparents who kept encouraging me to get in. Which is when I lost it and started yelling at them for standing by my half siblings more than me. I asked how they expected me to be okay after shit like that is said and nobody says a damn thing. I was scolded some more and grounded for ruining my grandma's birthday and raising my voice at them.

This is an arrangement that works quite well for me: I do all the chores, she has someone 24/7 in case she has a problem, and in exchange I don't have to pay for my food. My rent is also very low, the equivalent of 100$ a month.

I usually cook, but once in a while she decides to do it herself. And I'll be honest, it perfectly fits her tastes but I absolutely hate it, while I always adjust my cooking so that we both like it. She loves soup, but her soups are always bitter with fibers that stick in your gums, and there's a ton of pepper and no other spices, not even salt... Thankfully it doesn't happen often but I hate it when it does.

She also sometimes puts ingredients that she knows makes me sick; for example, for some reason I can't digest carrots. Even a small bite can get me stuck on the toilet for hours. The last time she made soup I asked if there were carrots and she denied it, 30 minutes later I knew she had lied to me because I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea.

Have I done anything wrong and to blame for her bad mood? Am I the asshole???

We moved in about 6 months ago to a 2bedroom apartment. It’s been good, aside from one thing. THE MESS. Oh god the mess. Dishes. Clutter. Tobacco everywhere from him rolling cigarettes. THE LAUNDRY (don’t even get me started on the laundry). the literal skid marks in the toilet. i can’t deal with it. I clean all my own mess. I have repeatedly had to sit him down (like he’s my child, and I don’t want kids!!) and tell him he has to pull his weight with the cleaning because A) he’s an adult and he should, and B) even when I try to clean the house, Its hard to clean faster than he makes mess because he lets it build up. I’m not his mum, I’m not his maid.

 It’s having to wait for him to clean something that really gets to me. If I could just do it myself instead of hearing ‘i’ll do it today i promise’, it’d be a lot better. 

He has acknowledged that it is disrespectful toward me. He has promised he will do better. But .. aside from the occasional 3-4 days where he picks up the slack, it’s all just been words and empty promises. It’s driving me nuts. 

I’m willing to try one last thing before I tell him i want to find a place of my own because I can’t live in some student man cave crackden: he pays the majority of the bills in exchange for cleaning being my job in our house. I propose that I pay my share of the rent and nothing else, he pays for everything else in exchange for my unpaid labour. Hopefully soon to be paid labour.

 If he’s just incapable of being tidy, I may as well just make it my job and get something out of it. At the moment, we pay 50/50 with everything, and we both work. He earns more than me, and money is a struggle for me, so that takes the stress off me a bit financially. And instead of waiting for his ass to just get up and clean, I have peace of mind knowing it’s done. 

Who knows, maybe I’ll even make a powerpoint about it, my slogan could be ‘not a maid (unless I get paid)’. 

So reddit, WIBTA for suggesting my partner pays a bigger portion of household bills to make up for me having to clean up after him? I worry I might be because I know some people don’t necessarily value unpaid labour in the household.

They were traveling all summer and we met up with them, and from the moment we met up with them my dad especially has not talked to me or been very nice towards me. He had his own share of stuff that happened on the trip with his truck which is what I initially thought the issue was. 

After a few nights my mom brought up how they wanted to renovate their basement into a 1 bedroom apartment, partly so I can move in without rent, partly to raise the value of their house.

This year I had many problems with apartments, having to move 3 times because of roommates, ex girlfriends, and/or landlord issues, which led to my parents trying to convince me it would be best for me to move into their basement. With my financial issues, they pitched it as a way for me to save money and stress. My brother has been following every piece of advice they give him and he is obviously favored because of this, on top of his major being one that will start higher then I will probably ever end up with (I’m going to be a music teacher). I also had gotten caught smoking weed a few years ago which I still do and don’t tell them, but I feel like if I tell them anything about my life it immediately is followed by advice I didn’t ask for or an opinion I didn’t ask for.

My mom just told me that my cousin was complaining to her about how much water we're using and how expensive it's going to be.

My cousin has never said anything to me about the water and I'm kind of irritated that she took my sprinkler.

I didn't know we had to pay for water since I've never lived in an area where that's a thing. My mom claims she didn't tell me directly because I've been stressed and she didn't want to add to it. Now I'm nervous about using the hose at all and spending time outside.

49,1dwwgtg,AITA for refusing to pay for my roommate’s meal?,"I, (20F) have a college roommate “Michelle” (34F) who I share summer housing with in our university’s dorms. Michelle is super sweet to me and despite our age gap we get along really nicely. It’s a great dorm situation and I think Michelle sees me as a little sister. I mostly like to cook my meals in our dorm kitchen but sometimes I treat myself to eating out. This is where the problem started. 

A lot of the time, Michelle will join me to eat out, either because she’s free and I want company when my friends are busy or because she invited me somewhere and I was free to come along. Lately, Michelle had been showering me in extra attention and even paying for most of my meals when we eat out. She’s super generous with her money but has no job and is completely reliant on her parents. I always told her that it was fine and that I could pay for myself but she always refused.

One day we went out to eat at a slightly nicer sushi restaurant to celebrate being done with midterms. To put it as politely as possible, Michelle is a bigger girl so she ordered dumpling appetizers, 5 sushi roles, and a drink. She usually orders 2-3 meals per restaurant we go to. I got one sushi roll and water because it was $10-$17 a roll and I’m not a big eater. 

When we were halfway through the meal, Michelle suggests that it’s my turn to pay for both our meals. I say, what do you mean? We never set up any kind of agreement. She got really upset, claiming that she “paid for all my other meals” and it was my turn to pay her back now. I told her I’m grateful that she was generous enough to pay for my other meals but I didn’t know there was an expectation to return the favor, especially because she ordered disproportionately more food than me and I couldn’t afford that much for one meal. Michelle got pissed and said something about how “your parents are so rich you can afford anything” and how one meal won’t break my bank. It’s true that my parents are paying for my college expenses and I’m eternally grateful that I won’t end up with any debt, but they give me a strict monthly budget that covers my groceries and gas. All the money I use to treat myself comes from my summer job. I told her that and she went silent for the rest of the meal. When we were finished, I made sure to ask for separate checks and she hasn’t said a word to me since. 

I’m really worried that this caused a rift in our friendship, maybe I was being unreasonable and I should have just paid for her meal. AITA?

54,1dwuxnm,AITA For asking neighbor to be considerate with their fireworks?,"I (M24) walked over to my neighbor's (F50) house with my toddler and talked to them about their 4th of July party and fireworks they were having this afternoon. I tried to be as civil and kind as possible, and we are (were?) pretty close before today and she has always been very sweet to us. I asked where they were shooting off their fireworks and asked if they would shoot them off as far away from our house as they are okay with. I never said anything about them not shooting them off or told her where I thought she should shoot them off. 


Background: We live in a rural area but our house is maybe 50ft from theirs, and our toddler's room is on the corner of our house closest to them. My intentions were to try and create any extra space possible between my toddler and the fireworks. We have a sound machine and blackout curtains in their room, but fireworks that close can still be heard and felt in our house.


Following my question, my neighbor gets uncharacteristically defensive and starts saying ""not to be a bitch, but.."" and explaining that they are shooting them off in this exact location, they are not moving it, we only do it once a year, etc. She then speaks to my toddler and says ""little baby, you might have to get a hotel or take some benadryl tonight, that's what I did with mine!"" She goes on for 2-3 min.


Throughout her saying all this, I was trying to be as kind and de-escalating as possible, saying things like ""That's no problem, that is fine, I think they'll be okay, etc."" but she kept going on and on. 


It was really hurtful and confusing, as I kept telling her it was fine and no problem but she wouldn't stop and kept getting heated it seemed like. We politely said bye at the end of the conversation. 


I texted her just now and said: ""Hey Neighbor I'm really sorry if I came off in a bad way! Where you guys are setting off your fireworks is just fine and plenty far from our house, I just wanted to be prepared. We love you guys and I definitely didn't mean to upset you if I did."" 


She responds with: ""It’s fine.  It’s just once a year, I’m sure they'll be fine.  Maybe we’ll see y’all later.""


Please tell me if I was being a complete asshole here. I never raised my voice, got hostile, standoffish, etc. I stayed polite and cordial and smiled through our conversation. I tried apologizing through text and she still seemed upset. I'm really confused and don't understand why she is acting like this - like I said, she is normally so sweet to us.

55,1dwuqpf,AITA for not supporting my friend with her sick grandma while I just had a baby?,"I (26f) recently had a baby. During my pregnancy my friend Susan (26f), was super excited for me, bought presents for my baby and was supportive, always asking how I was and occasionally visiting me (2 or 3 times). After my baby was born, she visited me a couple times and even helped me give him a bath once. Overall, she's a really good friend, and I always made sure she knew how much I appreciate her support. 

A couple of months ago, her grandma got really sick and she basically doesn't do anything by herself anymore. This was really exhausting to Susan since she had to split the time between working and taking care of her grandma. Meanwhile I had a newborn, and couldn't go out of the house because I was breastfeeding and taking care of the baby. Susan posted a lot in social media about her grandma, she got worse and was hospitalized several times. Susan is her primary caretaker, but she's having some help from her family now and then.

Two weeks ago I had to go back to work, my baby is 3 months old now. I go to the office in the morning and the rest of the day I'm in home office. I  have to work, take care of the baby, and do the majority of the house chores. When my husband gets home, he helps me but by then, I am completely exhausted. Two days ago, I noticed that Susan had excluded me from her social media, so I asked her what happened. She then proceeds to tell me that quote, ""she was posting mostly about her grandma and deleted all people that do not care for her situation."" I was taken aback and explained that I was not interacting much in social media, but every time I see her personally, I ask about how things are and that I care about the situation. Susan then told me that she had multiple times helped a lot of people, that she is a friend that is always present, but now only two friends of her went to visit her grandma at the hospital, also she expended a lot of money on geriatric diapers, medicines etc. and received few donations . Her grandma is retire and receives an amount of money from the government, but apparently, it is not enough to cover her expenses. 

While she was using the terms ""friends"" or ""people,"" I knew she was referring directly to me because I did not visited her grandma at the hospital or helped her financially. I explained to her that a have a baby only 3 months old, I cannot have contact to sick people and hospitals are full of them, especially her grandma having pneumonia that is contagious, I won't risk making my baby sick. About helping her financially, I know she gave my baby presents and I was very grateful, but I'm in a very tight spot with the expanses of a baby, plus, while in maternity leave I was making half what I usually make, only now I will start receiving my full payment.  I told her I was very sorry for her situation but couldn't do much due to my struggles. She did not responded me.
I thought a lot about it and asked myself if I could do more, but I don't see how, so AITA?

57,1dwumvv,AITA for dropping out of a bachelorette party/hen do,"Okay so,

My auntie(F32) is getting married next April. 

Growing up as a child we were extremely close. I (F25) stayed over every other weekend and she was like an older sister to me, I loved her and would tell her everything.

Anyway so when i’m around 14 she gets this boyfriend and stops spending as much time with me. Naturally as a teenager I get angsty about it and I stop talking to her as much. She stops reaching out and we eventually drift apart. 

Over the past few years as an adult I’ve reached out on numerous occasions asking if we could meet up and go for coffee etc but she always bails on me. She often says the reason being that she has to take care of her young autistic daughter. However i’ve even asked her to bring her along or it it’s too much trouble I can come over but she’s not bothered to reach out to me very much other than sending me the occasional snapchat memory.

HOWEVER, she still remains just as close with my cousin(23F) and they spend a lot of time together and my cousin looks after her daughter a lot. I’m not necessarily jealous of this as I am an adult and I have my own life now, but i do wonder why i never get included in things.

Anyway,  a few months back and my auntie has asked my cousin to be the Maid of honour at her wedding, with the bridesmaids being her sister, the groom’s sister and a few of of her friends. I’ve not been asked nor do i play a role in the wedding, but i’ve been invited to the hen do which I initially agreed to go to as my stepmum was going and we’re pretty close, and so they booked an airbnb and went ahead and planned it. 

Since then, my stepmum has dropped out of the hen do as she found out my dad (brides brother) was having an affair and they’re now getting a divorce, and i’ve moved almost 100 miles away to live with my boyfriend. 

As i’m not playing a crucial role in the wedding, I don’t drink, I live across the country, my stepmum is no longer attending I no longer want to go to the hen do.
 
My cousin is demanding I pay for my spot in the airbnb. Howvee I don’t believe I should pay for a trip i no longer want to go on, PLUS the airbnb is fully refundable. I understand it’s been a faff but I don’t believe I should pay.

60,1dwuelr,AITA for asking to hire a background checked dog walker ,"I (21) adopted a dog (m4) two months ago. He is wonderful and sweet and came with training so there hasn’t been any issues. I have three roommates all in their early 30’s we’ve all known each other for a few years and moved to a new city together around 8 months ago. 

I start a new job next week, working late shifts at a nursing home around 30ish minutes away from my apartment. The shifts aren’t especially long like 3pm- 11pm, but since it takes me a little while to get there and get home. My dog would be alone for around 9 hours most nights. One roommate works the graveyard shift and the other gets home 9pm some nights and earlier others.

Right now I’m the only one who walks and feeds the dog, since he’s completely mine and I don’t want anyone to feel like I’m taking advantage of them. I want to hire a dog walker from Rover to give him a night walk (like 8pm) on the nights I won’t get home until midnight. I plan on getting a lockbox for the key to our stairwell and we have a door code on the apartment. 

I also have a security camera that I can place in our entry way. My room is next to the front door and where the dog normally is. His leash is also right next to the front door, so a dog walker would never accidentally walk through the rest of the apartment. 

Despite all the precautions I’m taking when considering this, one roommate is upset I’m even considering this. And has asked that all of us discuss this. I’m not opposed to that and have set up a time for us to all meet and have even put together all the information about the service and the background checks and how I’m going to meet the person before hand and ask for references to speak to. 

*we haven’t met all together yet, I’m just concerned I might be missing something* 

TLDR would I be the asshole for hiring a vetted dog walker and using security cameras so my dog can get walked when I’m at work.

I come from a more affluent background, and my parents have always been generous with me. I’ve got a great job and a good savings. Seeing her work so hard and stress about her finances, I wanted to help. So, a few weeks ago, I offered to pay for her tuition when she transfers to the university.

I thought it was a good idea. I love her and I want to support her dreams. But when I made the offer, she got really upset. She accused me of thinking she was some sort of charity case and said that my offer made her feel inadequate and embarrassed about her financial situation.

She told me that she didn't want to feel indebted to anyone and that she wanted to achieve her goals on her own. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help and that I didn't see her as a charity case at all. I just wanted to ease her burden and support her in any way I could.

A few days ago, we got into a big fight. She was venting about her college dues, and I snapped and told her that if she wouldn't let me help by paying for it, then she shouldn't keep bringing it up around me.

I come from a more affluent background, and my parents have always been generous with me. I’ve got a great job and a good savings. Seeing her work so hard and stress about her finances, I wanted to help. So, a few weeks ago, I offered to pay for her tuition when she transfers to the university.

I thought it was a good idea. I love her and I want to support her dreams. But when I made the offer, she got really upset. She accused me of thinking she was some sort of charity case and said that my offer made her feel inadequate and embarrassed about her financial situation.

She told me that she didn't want to feel indebted to anyone and that she wanted to achieve her goals on her own. I tried to explain that I was just trying to help and that I didn't see her as a charity case at all. I just wanted to ease her burden and support her in any way I could.

A few days ago, we got into a big fight. She was venting about her college dues, and I snapped and told her that if she wouldn't let me help by paying for it, then she shouldn't keep bringing it up around me. She got really mad and accused me of not being supportive. Since then, she hasn't been talking to me at all. She’s been distant

So, AITA for offering to pay for my girlfriend’s college tuition?

We live with my mom and grandma who technically own the house so neither of us pay rent (I pay for my car which is on the family insurance as well as my phone bill. She doesn’t have to pay for anything according to mom and grandma). The reason I asked her so close to the party is because she is always out of the house when I am home. 

I’m hosting a coworkers birthday party and roommate used to work with us but got fired. After getting fired she tried to fight several of the coworkers who are invited to the party as well as full blown stalked one of them. The people that are coming to the party have requested that I ask her not to be home while they are over because of her previous actions. 

When I asked her this request ((to either come home after everyone had left or spend the night at her aunts which is what she normally does on Saturday nights) she got mad and started yelling that if people didn’t want to see her then we should go to somebody else’s house to hang out. She also told me that I couldn’t dictate when she comes back to HER home and that I was acting like a child for making this request instead of acting like an adult and “sucking it up”. 

I just want to know if I’m the asshole for making this request.

She ended up getting kicked out of the last place she lived for some reason and before we started dating I invited her to stay for a little while to get back on her feet but we ended up breaking up after a while because I didn’t feel I was ready to be in a relationship and my mental health was not in a good place.

66,1dwteep,AITA for asking my friend for my money back?,"Hey everyone! Help me know if I’m doing the right thing. This will be a long post. 

So to give you a bit of context, me (20F) and my 3 best friends (20,19 and 19, all F) became friends towards our junior year of high school and have been extremely close since. Lets call them  Sophia, Grace and Laura. This summer we were set to go on a beach trip all together with some more friends (10 of us in total), which would have been the 3rd summer trip we take together as a group. 

Grace offered to book the Airbnb as long as we sent her the money in advance, which we all did. The stay was supposed to start on August 1st. However, on July 1st she let us know that she accidentally had booked the wrong dates.

At that point, we tried to see if we’d get our money back from Airbnb (which of course we didn’t) and we started looking for a new accommodation. The cheapest we could find was 1.5k in total, which was outside of our range. 

At this point I asked my friends who would be taking responsibility for the lost money. I got no answer back. 

I was almost going to let this fly until last night. My 3 girlfriends went out last night (I couldn’t join since I had been really tired from working all week). I woke up today to several texts from Sophia saying she’d no longer come to the trip. The reason? Laura and Grace (who booked the accommodation) had left her in the club without notice because they wanted to save money on an uber, leaving Sophia stranded downtown Madrid alone at 5 AM.

In our shared group chat, I told Sophia that I understood her feelings and would like to know what had led my other friends to leave her stranded. I also said that I would really appreciate if we could all try to talk things out and keep the friend group together. Once again, no answer.

Privately, Sophia explained the situation and and also let me know that Grace had been saying that I was a bad friend for asking her for the lost money back for the second half of the trip. 

In a different group chat (the one we have with everyone else in our friend group), I said I thought it was a bit hypocritical to call me a bad friend for asking her to pay me back the 200$ she made me (and everyone else) lose due to not paying attention when booking the trip, yet leaving Sophia stranded to save 10 bucks on a cab. 

Another thing to note is that I am the only person in my friend group being a full time student and working full time, and that Grace gets 5k € in scholarships annually since her family manages to pull some tricks here and there to look poor in front of the system. She herself admits that she uses that money for shopping and travelling, which I included in my message as well.

Now the trip is cancelled (or at least I was kicked out of it), Grace and Laura called me selfish and a bad friend, and have left the group chat we are in together and refuse to answer my texts. 

So, AITA for asking for my money back?

68,1dwsr9i,AITA for wanting my bf to leave a party after I left?,"I'll try to keep this short, but some background:

I (19F) were invited to my friend Nora's (19F) birthday party with my boyfriend as my plus one. These past months Nora has been acting pretty off towards me and the rest of our friend group, she would suddenly lash out on us for small things with no explanation or apology and almost called our friend the n-word once. She is also part of another friend group who does not like us, and they've been talking shit about us to Nora, and she keeps being friends with them despite this.

My bf Jay (19M) knows all of this, as I've been very open about my frustrations about the situation to him, and during the days leading up to the birthday party I had told him many times that I did not really want to go and that I was scared of how her friends would treat us.

For her birthday, Nora invited us and her other friend group to a pregame before the party. The second we arrived it was very clear that none of them wanted us there. The first thing Nora said was ""You are late, and he's not invited"", which is weird considering that she did, in fact, tell me to bring Jay, AND we told her beforehand we would be late because of the bus. Her friends gave us really weird stares as if we had crashed the party, and no one made the effort to make space around the table where they ate, so we ended up having to sit in the sofa away from the others.

No one tried to talk to us or make us feel welcomed, so in the end, me and my bestfriend Eliza (19F) went outside to escape the nasty atmosphere, and I started crying. My Jay's friend showed up, so he ran to talk to him and left us by ourselves when I cried.

After an hour, me and Eliza decided to leave. We told Nora, who did not seem to care, and left. I did not tell Jay before we were on our way out, as I had not found him anywhere before. I told him we were leaving because we weren't having fun. He looked completely shocked and told me that I thought the party would be fun.

When we were at the bus stop, I started crying and I called Jay to explain more in depth that I left because we were clearly not wanted there and that it hurt to see Nora and her friends doing the most to make us feel unwelcome. He was clearly annoyed and told me that we should have tried harder to talk to someone. He ended up staying at the party for several more hours.

I explained to him the next day that I was hurt that he could so easily have fun and get drunk with the same people who made me cry when he knew I was at home crying. But when I explained it to him, I kinda just felt unreasonable, crazy and controlling. He said that he don't think he did anything wrong by staying, but that he's sorry I had a bad time.

For info, at any other ""normal"" party I would not mind him staying if I left. It just hurt this time because of the reason I left.

I think I might be TA because he's allowed to have fun without me of course.

69,1dwsm3y,AITAH for causing this drama in our friendship?,"(Fake names, and advance sorry for my bad English as it is not my first language)

So, Me (F), Eve (F), and Ted (M) have been in a trio for almost a year now. We're pretty close and done everything together, we're the type of friends that are loud, clingy, touchy, but we're all comfortable with each other, in short your typical teenage friendship. For a little context, We also have a quadro, including our Friend, whom I'll call Jer (F). Yet, Jer mostly hangout with her other friends on the different section that's why only me, eve, and Ted are mostly together.

Me and Eve spends most of our time together, having girl talks that Ted can't be involve with, if you know what I mean. Unknown to us that Ted feels left out, and this is when he started to ignore me and eve. Me and eve are confused, then one of our friend came up to us out of curiosity and ask if what happened and why they don't see the three of us often, she also said that Ted's reason is he felt left out by us. This made me and eve wonder, we always tell Ted if he's comfortable with us and whenever he feel uncomfortable or left out, we can adjust for him, we always expressed it. 

Ted had been ignoring us for a while (2-3 weeks) and me and Eve got tired of trying to win him back so we decided to ignore him too. Yet, we stopped shortly as we noticed that Jer is being affected by this. So in the end, me and Eve decided to stop this ignoring state and try to win Ted again, for Jer and our friendship. We started it small like trying to ask him if we wants to eat lunch with us and stuffs. Not until Jer send me screenshots of Ted's words to me and eve. There he said that he don't want to be friends with us anymore and would rather spend time with his new friends. He also asked Jer if she would rather have friends with us that's loud, clingy, touchy, etc (the things we only do to our closest friends). Then he told Jer that she will just realize it later on, which broke me.

Since that day, I felt uncomfortable expressing my clingy side to anyone again, even Eve and Jer, fearing that they'll think the same of me. Months passed and Ted has been interacting with us more but we don't acknowledge him as much as before because of what he had done, also, Jer had been distant with us lately.

As our school year ends, me and Eve was dumbfounded when we saw that Jer Blocked us from her social media accounts, we don't have any problems or anything, or that we're aware of. We're okay the day before but then she blocked us. It broke me and eve, personally, thinking that she also thought the same thing as Ted but she didn't expressed it to us even though we kept asking her. So, After that incident, I blocked Ted and Jer.

So, Me (F), Eve (F), and Ted (M) have been in a trio for almost a year now. We're pretty close and done everything together, we're the type of friends that are loud, clingy, touchy, but we're all comfortable with each other, in short your typical teenage friendship. For a little context, We also have a quadro, including our Friend, whom I'll call Jer (F). Yet, Jer mostly hangout with her other friends on the different section that's why only me, eve, and Ted are mostly together.

Me and Eve spends most of our time together, having girl talks that Ted can't be involve with, if you know what I mean. Unknown to us that Ted feels left out, and this is when he started to ignore me and eve. Me and eve are confused, then one of our friend came up to us out of curiosity and ask if what happened and why they don't see the three of us often, she also said that Ted's reason is he felt left out by us. This made me and eve wonder, we always tell Ted if he's comfortable with us and whenever he feel uncomfortable or left out, we can adjust for him, we always expressed it. 

Ted had been ignoring us for a while (2-3 weeks) and me and Eve got tired of trying to win him back so we decided to ignore him too. Yet, we stopped shortly as we noticed that Jer is being affected by this. So in the end, me and Eve decided to stop this ignoring state and try to win Ted again, for Jer and our friendship. We started it small like trying to ask him if we wants to eat lunch with us and stuffs. Not until Jer send me screenshots of Ted's words to me and eve. There he said that he don't want to be friends with us anymore and would rather spend time with his new friends. He also asked Jer if she would rather have friends with us that's loud, clingy, touchy, etc (the things we only do to our closest friends). Then he told Jer that she will just realize it later on, which broke me.

Since that day, I felt uncomfortable expressing my clingy side to anyone again, even Eve and Jer, fearing that they'll think the same of me. Months passed and Ted has been interacting with us more but we don't acknowledge him as much as before because of what he had done, also, Jer had been distant with us lately.

70,1dwscwv,AITA for refusing to host my husband’s best friend and his family,"My husband has a childhood friend, both the same age. This friend had his wedding during COVID in 2020. Strict measures, you know the drill. At that time, we were living abroad, so crossing borders was nearly impossible. When he got the invite, we had only been together for a few months, so it was a fresh relationship (they invited him alone). I was working in a COVID ward and managed to get him across the border as a worker in a private car (about an 8-hour journey), and I also got him a PCR test 2 hours before departure (I mention this because the whole arrangement wasn’t easy). He attended the wedding with a gift (stayed with his parents, wedding was nearby).

Four years later, we were getting married in chateau (about 4 hours from both my family and his, so halfway) and invited the friend along with his wife and child. They said they’d come and make a trip out of it, exploring the area. He was the only friend for whom we paid accommodation right at the venue, just like for family (5* hotel). I was already struggling with this, as we had agreed not to cover accommodation for friends. It’s also worth noting that this friend is a teacher and the wedding was on a Saturday, a week before the end of the school year.

A few days before the wedding, they called to say they wouldn’t come because he didn’t get leave for Monday and it wasn’t worth the trip for just a few days. We ended up paying for the room since it was too late to cancel. We didn’t receive a gift or even a congratulatory card from them.

Today, they wrote saying they want to visit because they’re going to an event in our city and would appreciate accommodation for them and his sister. I’m against it because I don’t see a reason to take leave, pick them up from the train station, and host them when I don’t view them as friends anymore (no contact throughout the year, no birthday or name day wishes). My husband disagrees, saying it’s his best friend and I’m preventing him from seeing him.

73,1dwqdk1,AITA for telling my friend she is not in a position to lecture me? ,"This November, I (18F) began dating ‘’Jason’’ (23M). We met at a music festival that was being held near my college. I was the one who approached him; I initially thought he was around my age, maybe a little older, 20 or 21. Nope, he was actually 23. After meeting, I gave him my number and told him we should hang out sometime. He didn't text or call me for a week, so I ended up calling him, and we began dating after that. So far, it's been going great. He treats me amazingly; he is polite and respectful of me. I've dated three other guys my age in high school and college, and they were all a bunch of immature assholes, as most people my age are, I suppose.



I  first decided to keep my relationship secret from my friends and family since my parents and older brother are both very protective of me and I knew they would not be happy with me seeing an older guy,  but recently I  decided to come clean about it. My parents and older brother, as I suspected, weren't happy with me dating someone five years older. But they mostly accepted  it. Though my dad gave the standard ""if you hurt my daughter, I'll kill you"" talk, which he didn't give to any of my previous boyfriends, I'm guessing because they were boys my age.



I figured it was time to introduce him to my friends also. Most of them were happy or indifferent, except one: Amy (22F). She acted friendly when she met him but afterward pulled me aside and told me she was worried about me. She said that when she was my age, she dated older guys, and that they were all immature assholes who used her for sex and treated her badly. I told her that I appreciated her concern but that I trusted Jason and that he was a good person. After all, I was the one who made the first move; I was also the one who initiated sex between the two of us. Despite me saying this, she did not drop it and instead kept trying to convince me to break up. After a while of this, I got fed up and said she wasn't in a position to lecture me about relationships considering she was single. I know it's stupid and immature, and I immediately apologized after I said it, but I could tell that struck a nerve. Her last boyfriend cheated on her, and she has been single for over a year. I realized what I said was mean and apologized, but she was angry too and stormed off. We haven't talked in a week. I kind of feel bad for what I said, but at the same time, it wouldn't have happened if she had stopped trying to convince me after I told her to drop it. So, AITA?

I understand not wanting to ride rollercoasters in that state, but I’m not sure I understand why I have to stay home too. I would really prefer to not spend the one weekend I get off after months of planning to be sitting at home while watching him play Elden Ring between shits.

I did ask him if it was okay if I still went and he said he’d really prefer is I stayed home. I know if it was me who was sick, I would tell him to go without me because I’ve done it before. Am I really just being insensitive?

78,1dwon91,AITA For Refusing To Keep The Peace By Apologising,"Last night, I (18F), cooked dinner for my younger brother (14M) and I. For the past 3 weeks I've really struggled with my appetite and have barely managed one meal a day. It's been so bad that I've been called in for a last minute hospital appointment to do some investigations. I won't go into detail but it's not a good sign. I had barely eaten anything yesterday (2 pieces of toast and a bag of crisps). I cooked dinner and when serving it, my brother only wanted a small portion. I hate food waste so I put the rest in my bowl. I probably wasn't going to eat all of it.

The moment I sat down, my mum looked at the bowl (it's one of those stupid fancy bowls that are 2 cm deep so barely fit anything) and said ""that's a massive portion"" and literally scoffed. I told her that it really wasn't it is just a shallow bowl. She insisted the bowl was huge and there was loads in there. I said I had roughly the same portion as my brother who also scoffed and said ""you really don't, that's huge"". I said that the meat (it was bolognese) had all fallen to the bottom which was propping my spaghetti up to which my dad started laughing at me. She kept saying how huge the portion was, so I left all my stuff and went to my room. As I left I heard my mum say ""just let her strop"" and then ""but look at it, it's a humungous portion"" and they all laughed.

I went to my room and over the course of the next few hours I didn't receive any apology and had also left my phone so they knew they couldn't text me. It is now the next day. My dad is telling me to apologise to them for ""storming off"" and leaving my food. I won't. I always end up apologising for being upset with the things he or she says to me to keep the peace but for me this was too far. I can't prove to you that the portion really wasn't ""massive"", you'll just have to take my word for it however even if it was, I don't think that's an excuse for what was said. I'm not overweight and I'm also struggling to eat. My mum should've been happy that I was eating.

When we started dating/being together he had a job but he had decided to quit that job as they were requiring him to go into the office instead of working from home due to poor performance. I had advised him at the time to wait until he had a new job lined up but he did not do this. He is still jobless to this date. He is trying to get a job and gets interviews but never gets hired. I feel bad for him.

I work a heavy mental job in the emergency services where I work 6 days on 4 days off, sometimes totalling over 60hours a set. Even with this my finances are pretty tight due to the expensive area I live in, this is where my job is located so i can’t move. 

On my days off I do like doing things but I also value rest and stay at home. My partner is under the impression that we need to do something every single day I’m off and together, often resulting in me driving multiple hours, doing things and I’m often the one paying for things as he doesn’t have a job.

Don’t get me wrong I do not mind paying for things when he’s struggling but he gets upset that when I say no to going out as I want to stay inside or I haven’t slept great. Stating “we haven’t done anything”. I tried to explain to him that even one day I couldn’t do anything cause a horrible migraine that took part of my sight, he tried to argue this was still a relaxing day and we now haven’t done anything in 2 days..

It seemed he didn’t want to listen to my opinion about staying home or doing something local and just got in a strop and laid down and said he was sleeping.

81,1dwo81t,AITA for complaining about birthday dinner?,"
It was my (31f) birthday this week, and that evening after work my parents booked dinner for the three of us at a nearby Malaysian place. I had wanted Indian but dad doesn't like Indian. For moral and religious reasons I eat basically plant based. My parents eat anything. Given it was eastern cuisine, I assumed we would be ordering 3 dishes and sharing so as to try a variety banquet style, but they insisted they wanted their own with meat and that I should order a single dish to myself.

I was annoyed and disappointed because:
A - it was a ethnic restaurant so it's typical to share banquet style, 
B - it was my birthday and they can't and won't cook plant based for me any other time of year, and 
C - because they could have had their chosen meals made plant based as all dishes could be modified.

I expressed how this made the dinner pretty bland for me and that I was excited for it only to try a whole bunch of dishes, but they insist I'm a childish, selfish and neurotic narcissist and that they had gone out of their way already to find a restaurant that had plant based options. 

So Reddit, please tell me if I Am I the asshole for wanting shared dinner for my birthday to be my choosing 

Edit: some clarification-
-A few comments have noted my use of the word ‘ethnic’ so to clarify I meant non-western European   Where there is one plate/meal per person, as opposed to many of the places they colonised that eat shared and family style. 

-a few comments ask why I expect them to cook for me. I don’t, I meant in reference to Xmas or other holidays where they do eat shared style with extended family but I eat separately. If I go to their house to visit they cook dinner for themselves and I buy/bring my own.

- for clarification I was not asking to choose the meals but asking that meat be left out or subbed so we could all try a variety. ",Asshole,2024-07-06,"AITA for complaining about birthday dinner?

My dad for as long as I can remember has been misogynistic. He’d always downplay mom’s feelings and emotions and would go as far as to say really offensive things about her while there were guests over at our house. His biggest fear is mom making important decisions or people thinking that he’s not the head of the family. He also continuously made comments about how women should do all the housework, that mom never worked (have been doing all the chores and taking care of three children on her own and also looking after dad’s relatives).

Anyways, their fight went as follows: dad and my BIL (my sister’s husband) were sitting at the table and dad was making some snarky remarks about my sister’s child. Mom got angry and told him “if you’re done eating and don’t like your granddaughter’s company that much, then just leave”. He got furious because he was “humiliated” in front of another man. 

They haven’t been talking since and he said he’d never forgive her. Drama queen behavior, I know. Today they fought about it again, he told her to fo and repeated all the offensive things. Mom got really upset, started crying and left, she also has a tendency to faint when she’s overwhelmed (it’s a medical condition) which we try to prevent but he didn’t care. So he started saying offensive things about mom to me and I was like “you know you’re in the wrong, right?

My friends often comment that my stories have potential to become popular because of my large following and industry connections. But They also vaguely imply that they expect to be hired? Most only hint/joke at it, but one friend (23m) makes it very clear and frequent, saying stuff like, “hire me,” “give me a job,” or “can I work on your projects, PLEEEEEASE?!”

They say these things jokingly, but I know they’re serious, which gets really annoying as I don’t like being seen as just a gateway. And If I were to create a production (on the slim chance), tbh I wouldn’t want to hire most of my friends, maybe a few based on their skills.

But my hesitation for this particular perosn is partly due to my previous experience with them when I directed a animated short film for on a University. They just didn’t follow guidelines, took criticism poorly, and made the experience exhausting as I really didn’t want to come off as mean, but it was hard to explain that what they were doing was wrong or needed corrections. I’ve also heard that working with friends on big projects isn’t always a good idea at the start. 

And so, last night When my friend joked about being hired again, I decided to explain that if I ever had a production, I probably wouldn’t hire any of my friends.

They responded with “fine…okay then” and left shortlly after (this was on Discord) and  I felt really bad afterward.

I just really don’t like only being seen as a potential gateway to things. Ofc if my actual job asks for recommendations, I would suggest them, but for my personal project, i personally wouldn’t choose them.

I’m also sorta nervous now that he’s gonna go “tattle” on me in to the others and how they may start looking at me as entitled.

I’d also like to state that if my goal were to become reality, it won’t Happen until many years later.

I (F26) went on a trip last year with 6 of my friends. It was at another city in our country and for one week. 

One of the friends, ""Lisa"" (F26) was clearly not enjoying herself the entire time. Out of everyone, I'm the least close with her and I'd never been on a trip with her before. She was almost always complaining about something - it's too hot, I don't like this song, there's not enough alcohol in my drink, etc. Just constant negativity. It was pretty draining to be around.

I did make an effort to ask Lisa if there was anything she wanted to do on the trip but she'd just shrug or say she wants to go home. She wasn't hostile or anything but she was being a grouch.

She did end up leaving the trip 3 days early and did not tell anyone until she was already on her way home and we were wondering where she was. I thought this was really disrespectful but I didn't feel like it was my place to say anything to her.

I hadn't really spoken to Lisa since. Me and 2 friends (who also attended the previous trip) are planning another trip this Autumn. Lisa heard about this from another friend and basically invited herself to come along and said she'll go with us.

I spoke to Lisa and told her that I think it's better if she uses her vacation time for something else, as I don't think she'll enjoy this trip based on what happened last time. She got very irritable but said she'd think about it. She later sent me a DM asking if I hate her and if I'm just trying to exclude her. I told her I don't hate her I just don't think she'll enjoy the vacation. She then blocked me and sent everyone else a DM saying that we are all toxic and she has been struggling with anxiety.

85,1dwnu3x,AITA for insisting we change our son’s name?,"My wife (24F) and I (28M) had our first baby five months ago. We’ve been together for 6 years, married for 5. He is a beautiful little boy and we gave him the same first name as my wife’s father, ‘Keith’.

My wife grew up hating her father for cheating on her mother and abandoning the family. In the past decade, he worked tirelessly to improve their relationship. In her family, it’s typically tradition for the first grandson and granddaughter to be named after their grandparents and my wife was proud to name our son after her father.

However, a few weeks ago, my wife and her father had a MASSIVE argument. 

Turns out, he is convinced that for some reason, I am going to cheat on my wife. He thinks we got married too young and I’ll get bored of her now that she’s devoting all her time to our son.

He told my wife this after she opened up to him about how worried she was about being pregnant so soon after giving birth. We didn’t plan the second pregnancy and a few days after the argument my wife miscarried and it was a painful moment for the both of us. 

Essentially, he kicked her while she was already down for no reason. I had a friendly relationship with him but I know he wanted my wife to marry someone from her own background. 

Since the argument, my wife has not been calling our son by his name. She’s using nicknames, calling him ‘the baby’ etc. She said that she needs time to get over the argument with her dad, but she also blames him for the miscarriage which is something I don’t think she’ll get over. FIL has made no attempts to apologise or reconcile.

A month into my wife refusing to use our baby’s name, I said that we needed to change it because it’ll be better for my wife’s mental health and our son’s development. If this argument continues or is ever brought up again, she can’t be too upset to use his name when he’s old enough to actually know it.

We’ve started the process now to change the name and somehow it got back to FIL AND he knows that I suggested it. He is infuriated. He said that I was supposed to be the levelheaded one since my wife is post partum and recovering from a miscarriage and that I’ve just made their rift a million times worse since I’ve denied him the family tradition. My in laws think I’m an asshole for insisting on the name change since now it’ll be even harder for them to reconcile.

We’ve been together for 6 years, married for 5. He is a beautiful little boy and we gave him the same first name as my wife’s father, ‘Keith’.

My wife grew up hating her father for cheating on her mother and abandoning the family. In the past decade, he worked tirelessly to improve their relationship. In her family, it’s typically tradition for the first grandson and granddaughter to be named after their grandparents and my wife was proud to name our son after her father.

86,1dwndxe,AITA for not letting my friend steal from supermarkets and bars in the community and country I live in?,"Hi all,

So my (29m) friend (28m) from my home country (UK) came to visit me in my country of residence (Finland) where I have lived for 2 years. We haven't spent a lot of time together over the last few years but we used to be very close in our early 20s. I feel like I've grown up a lot over the last few years but I still figured we'd get on well. He has some very particular anti-establishment views on institutions, capitalism, and capitalism. He has some fairly anarchistic viewpoints. I can understand these viewpoints. I consider myself quite a critical socialist kind of person. But I also have a full time job and obey the laws of the land.

Anyways he has come to visit, and we went to a supermarket and he was complaining about the prices. He then asked casually if there were self-checkouts, and I said yes, to which he replied 'Oh well I can just rob half of the stuff then.' I asked him not to, repeatedly, and he did anyway. He has pretty much done that every time we've gone to a supermarket. 

We also went to a bar last night and had plans to go tonight to watch the football. He wants to bring his own beer in his bag and pour his own beers into his glass in the bathroom, basically stealing from the bar in my opinion. Again, I've asked him not to.

He claims that 'literally everyone he knows does this'. I know there is an issue with shoplifting in the UK, and a cost of living crisis. I also know that security systems are lacking in the UK. But I think it is disrespectful to me, and the community and country I live in to come here and just start stealing from everywhere and everything. He's absolutely adament he's going to do it. I almost think its a principle to him. Like if things are slightly overprice, he feels entitled to rob things.

I also am worried that if I am in a supermarket with him and he steals things and gets caught, then the security could consider me an accomplice. He seems to think he will just get away with it because he always does it, but he doesn't know about security systems in Finland and how they work. Just because it works for him in Bristol, it doesn't mean it will here.

  
Anyways, he's angry at me now because he thinks I shouldn't be able to tell him how to behave. But I think he's being disrespectful to me, as he's staying at my apartment, in my community. And if he gets caught tonight at the bar that would embarress me in front of my friends.



Also, just to add. He's not totally broke. He has enough money. I also told him how expensive Finland is and he decided to come here anyway.

AITA for telling him to stop behaving like this?

Rhea and I are really close and I'd do anything for her, anytime. We can annoy each other and sometimes we fight but she's one of my favorite people. We're the closest in our family by far. I can't stand Ava. Rhea wishes they had a better relationship with Ava can be such a bully to Rhea.

Sometimes it's like Ava wanted to be an only child. She's worse toward Rhea which bothers me more than if she was that way with me. But she can also be a total jerk to me. Sometimes it's annoying little kid things. But she's also quick to be more cruel. She can go from hiding my phone somewhere and refusing to tell me where it is (which led to a broken phone once) to ruining my homework because I wouldn't ""help"" with hers, which is code for doing her homework for her. One time she deleted my entire finished essay because I wouldn't do her math homework for her. Another time she spilled water all over my assignment sheet. When we were younger it was worse because we got a lot of handouts and it was easier. 

With Rhea she's way worse. She tries to humiliate her by telling kids stuff that Rhea did that others would make fun of her for, like when she used to have accidents when we were little or how one time puked all over Santa. Ava also outed Rhea as a lesbian before Rhea wanted to be out. Ava wasn't even told. She heard Rhea and me talking and decided to spill to people.

Our parents discipline Ava and they try to make it up to us. But I know they expect forgiveness when Ava doesn't ask for it and that's where this comes in. 

Every year for our birthday we get one big gift and three much smaller ones. The big one always takes priority. Ava's birthday is in a couple of weeks and they had to spend a portion of the money set aside for her big gift because we had a big plumbing leak. So they asked me if I would share the cost with them so Ava can still get her big gift. They know I have a job and that I save money. So I get why they'd think to ask me. But for Ava? I said no. My parents told me they know we have our issues but she's still my sister and they said I will make things worse if I don't do this for her, because she knows I would do it for Rhea in a heartbeat. I told them Rhea deserves it, Ava doesn't, and she definitely doesn't deserve it from me. My parents said they'd give me the money back in $50 each week and I said no way again.

I (27F) have been friends with Megan (27F) (false name for privacy purposes) for around four years now. We met through an ex of mine (he is still one of my closest friends) whilst they were ‘hooking up’ together.

Since then, we became really good friends but she’s has the absolute worst taste in men.

The guys she dates are not good guys. They are either drug dealers or have been to prison. It’s like she clings onto anyone that will give her attention. Even if it’s the *wrong* kind of attention. I pre-warn her ‘that’s a red flag’ and her response always is ‘I know, but you know me, I love a dickhead’. But then as soon as it ends, she will post quotes on social media or she will plaster the events of what happened all over Snapchat, Facebook story, and instagram story, clearly, to get attention.

Recently, Megan started speaking to this 23 year old guy that was in prison who she had never met before. He has two kids with a one night stand and previously had been arrested for physically assaulting his ex. I pointed out ALL of the red flags to her. Her response was ‘Yeah I know but it’s my decision and yeah I’ll be heartbroken but I’m lonely.’ I followed with ‘Well if he can abuse his ex girlfriend, he will do it to you’ and all she said back was ‘He would never, because he knows my brother would be after him.’

Well low and behold he physically abused her. He broke into her apartment and cut up all of her clothes and ruined all of her makeup. Poured Pepsi all over her bed. And you know what? She still hasn’t blocked him. 

Since then, she has been posting ‘why do I always attract the wrong men’, and posting very attention seeking quotes. I had enough and I lost my shit with her. 

I told her we all attract bad men but she’s the one choosing them. It’s her fault for choosing men that have been in prison or are drug dealers because they will NEVER be good for her and to stop constantly seeking attention when things inevitably go wrong because nobody feels sorry for her anymore. It’s a vicious cycle and she needs to stop sleeping with random men because she’s lonely and that she needs to resolve whatever trauma she has because she is NOT going to have a healthy relationship until she does so not to expect me to feel sorry for her anymore. 
Now, I’m of course the bad guy and she thinks I’m an asshole.AITA?

EDIT: I have made the decision to distance myself. As my friend said ‘when does she ask how WE are?’ Not only that. But she never apologises. Ever. I can’t keep watching her make the same mistake over and over again to then play the victim.

To people telling me I need to support her and make her go to therapy I HAVE TRIED. She will NOT do it. The most she’s ever done is a domestic abuse course and all she did was choose another guy that’s even worse.

She needs therapy. It’s VERY clear. But I cannot force someone into doing something they don’t want to do nor is it my responsibility.

It’s her fault for choosing men that have been in prison or are drug dealers because they will NEVER be good for her and to stop constantly seeking attention when things inevitably go wrong because nobody feels sorry for her anymore. It’s a vicious cycle and she needs to stop sleeping with random men because she’s lonely and that she needs to resolve whatever trauma she has because she is NOT going to have a healthy relationship until she does so not to expect me to feel sorry for her anymore. 
Now, I’m of course the bad guy and she thinks I’m an asshole.AITA?

EDIT: I have made the decision to distance myself. As my friend said ‘when does she ask how WE are?’ Not only that. But she never apologises. Ever. I can’t keep watching her make the same mistake over and over again to then play the victim.

To people telling me I need to support her and make her go to therapy I HAVE TRIED. She will NOT do it. The most she’s ever done is a domestic abuse course and all she did was choose another guy that’s even worse.

She needs therapy. It’s VERY clear. But I cannot force someone into doing something they don’t want to do nor is it my responsibility. My dad died last Tuesday so my family are my priority right not and organising his funeral. NOT HER! So STOP being mean and nasty to me because ‘I need to help her’",0.0,1.0132311582565308,1,0
94,1dwlb97,AITA For giving the cold shoulder,"    Two coworkers and I went to a theme park yesterday. (I will call them Ay and Be) We ended up getting there right at open (8am) and stayed until close (12am) so it was a very long and hot day. 

    At the very end of the night, all three of us were walking towards the exit of the park joking around when Ay had said“it’s funny because you look like you really shouldn’t be allowed to go near children.” (For context the very last ride we had gotten off was a kiddie ride that Be really wanted to go on and because there was an odd number one of us I had volunteered to ride alone.) This struck me as an odd comment but I decided to take it on the chin and respond with “That’s pretty f’ed up” while chuckling. Be chimed in playfully and said“that’s extra f’ed because we all work with kids.” Ay then said “It’s not f’ed because he’s said that same thing about himself.” After Be asked me if I ever said that about myself I responded by looking at Ay and saying “I absolutely do not remember saying anything like that.” Ay then told me that she remembers me saying that in the past but again I do not remember saying anything of the sorts. 

    As we exited the park and started walking towards the car I couldn’t help but wonder what Ay had meant by that comment and, as I came to a conclusion, I couldn’t help but get very upset with Ay. It’s very easy to tell when I get upset because generally I’m really good at putting on my “happy mask”.

96,1dwl1ao,AITA for telling someone they were a bad friend?,"Hello, I am a 21 year old female currently in college. Lacy (19 female) was a friend of mine. Me and her were part of the same friend group with Mj (19 female), Christy (19 female), and Jacob (20 male/my boyfriend) all fake names by the way. As the only 21 year old I was the alcohol buyer for when we wanted to have game nights inside and just play board games.

In January, I was sick with the flu. In this room with nearly everyone else also being sick of some sorts, but I got it much worse. While they were sick a few days to a week, I had it for a month and ended up in the hospital. Not my choice either, I nearly had to be dragged in because I didn’t want to have to pay the expensive bill after.

Anyways, during this month I didn’t do much. I’d like to point out not only was I the only one able to buy alcohol, I was also the only one who brought a car on campus. So when Lacy wanted to go to this party, it was me who she expected to provide that ride. 

I was throwing up one morning, shivering and then sweating right after. I had no energy. I couldn’t sleep long and I couldn’t eat. It was horrible. Jacob was on the phone texted beside me and said that Lacy asked if I could take her to buy alcohol. I told him to tell her I wasn’t well enough to be driving. I needed help half the times I had to walk to the bathroom. Well Lacy came up and pushed and pushed. Ignoring Jacob’s words, me telling her I wasn’t feeling well. To shut her up, I went. I couldn’t argue, I was too exhausted. 

I bought her the alcohol. Let her go about her life. Now, after this I went home so a week and when I came back I was feeling better and that’s when things went down. Lacy was causing issues with the entire group. Sneaking guys into Mj’s room, stealing from Christina, flirting with Jacob. 

Well, Mj confronted Lacy. Mj had to leave due to her getting too angry. Christy was of course standing there mainly spectating after saying what she had to say. 

Me? Let’s just say, I told her she was a horrible friend to everyone in the group. I brought up the time I wanted to leave a party because I was uncomfortable and she refused, then proceeded to grab Jacob from me and nearly drag him. I yanked him back and I put her right in her place. I told her she was a bad friend for that and for wanting me to buy her alcohol as I was horribly sick, ending up in the hospital the next day. She kept quiet and all she mumbled was a “sorry”. To end it, we kicked her out and sat outside to make sure she didn’t come back in while she waited for her Uber to get there. She got banned from the campus by higher ups.

97,1dwl0yq,WIBTA in this situation?,"

My fiancé (23M) and his best friend (23F) have been friends for 2 years and talk everyday. When myself and his best friend met each other we also thought it would be good for us to be friends so we got closer and spoke almost everyday then, after around 6 months or so, we fell out and didn’t talk for a week. 
  Eventually we made up and all was good again until the other day I reach out and ask if she was okay as she hasn’t really been saying much in her responses with me, to which she said she didn’t really have anything to say but that was was fine.
  I decided it was probably best to leave her to it for a the rest of that day which I did. I thought that if she wanted to chat then she will reach out. 
  3 days go by with no so much as a “hi” or “you good?” But to then find out on social media she was taking a break from people for a while (which is fair enough, but she didn’t let me know that was the case I found out from a story) So I just leave her to it she’s on a break after all.
   The next day after finding out she was on a break she messages me saying I copied her on a different social platform. (Which was not the case: the profile picture, banner picture, username, colour scheme was ALL different so I couldn’t have been copying her)

The fact that after nothing from her for 3 days then I randomly get nipped at about a social platform being a “copy” of hers, makes me wonder that if she hadn’t messaged about it how much longer would she have went without messaging? 
   

I have been very upset for the past couple months on and off because of this up and down with his friend there has been a lot of mental and emotional stress for me and throughout the whole thing, he has still spoken to her like nothing has happened.

Would I be the asshole to want my fiancé to reduce contact for a little bit while I process what I have gone through with his female best friend? Or should I just accept him talking to her everyday regardless of how it makes me feel and just get over it? 
(Since I can’t pick and choose HIS friends)


 

(Sorry if some of this didn’t make sense I am a little rubbish at explaining things sometimes)

99,1dwky55,AITA for telling my friend her partner made me uncomfortable way after the fact?,"This is a long distance friendship. Four-ish months ago I traveled to celebrate a milestone for Shelly (fake name). Maverick(fake name of her partner) opted to DD before the night began. I actually struggled to catch a buzz that evening, but I took the ride back because why not stay safe anyway, right? 

My uncomfortableness began before leaving the bar though. Shelly recently became more open about being queer, and we’ve bonded over coming out around the same times. I guess because Maverick knows this about me, he began pointing out random girls at the bar. Asking if I was attracted to them, or casually saying they weren’t bad. It was insulting to me that he assumed I was attracted to any girl there because I’m queer. He never made these comments when Shelly was around, and that rubbed me the wrong way too. 

Later during the car ride back, alone with Maverick again, he made some statements that left me frozen in my seat. Saying he’d always been attracted to girls that looked/acted like me. And later he’d found a way to trickle in that he’d never had a threesome, but wasn’t opposed to it. I know he wasn’t directly saying it, but it made me feel propositioned. And it felt just unnecessary. 

I got home, went to bed, & went on with my life. This wasn’t the first time I’d had an experience like this with a taken man. Prior to years of therapy and continued healing from SA traumas, I would’ve buried this memory. Never speaking, or even thinking of it again. And at first that’s what happened. 

It wasn’t until last week that the memory came up during a random conversation with someone else. Once the memory was spoken aloud it wouldn’t leave the front of my mind. I felt so bad/wrong about not consciously thinking of how badly that situation felt, and for not telling Shelly sooner. 

Side note: Since that night they’ve gotten engaged and married with no notice or ceremony. She seems very happy as a newlywed and is so excited to be celebrated over a late bachelorette party in about a month. 

After sleeping on it, I decided to be honest with my friend. I’ve seen the pain she’s had from being in the dark before. I texted to let her know about a memory popping up from that night and asked if I could call to tell her - trying to ease into the topic. If we lived closer I would’ve told her in person.

I haven’t spent for than 5 hours with him in the last 8 months, there’s zero intimacy and everytime I try to initiate he shuts it down. He visited thrice during these 8 months, the first time he was here for 3 days. In which, he gave me 3 hours for a lunch and got mad at me for expecting more time as he wanted to spend it with his sister and niece who were visiting. 

The second time he visited he was around for 2 weeks but his mom was sick, I wasn’t expecting him to give me time. But we had lunch, his mom was okay before we sat down. In about 2 hours he started getting calls from her, and he left. As soon as I was on the way home (within 30 minutes) she was okay and it was just nausea. This time he got pissed at me for no reason, and said I am illogical and he needs to spend time with his mom but he was visiting the rest of his family and planning his cousins wedding where he spend 4-5 hours every other night. 

Third time he visited, he did not even text me through out his trip, I understand he wants to spend more time with his mom and was at the doctors with her. But I had zero texts in 5 days, I messaged to check up on him and his mom and he was cold. 

He’s visiting again next month, it is our anniversary. Earlier he had promised to be with me then, but yesterday he said he will only visit for 2-3 days to see his mom and for her appointments, so he might see me in September. 

I was hurt but I’m scared of saying something and him flipping out on me.

103,1dwjtfi,AITA for not going to an event because the tickets were too high for me?,"hi! my boyfriend plays music and had a gig on today. I said that I'd come at the start as I'd assumed that it was a free event like normal, but then I saw that it would've costed around 60 dollars to get in. my issue with this is the fact that I'm not into music beyond just listening to it and what was being played today wouldn't have interested me beyond my boyfriend playing. he said that if I can't get in with him for free then he'd pay for my ticket, but I just don't find it reasonable to be that much for 1 ticket and I don't even enjoy the subject enough for it to be worth it???  I've been to every gig that I could but today when I started having doubts on the ticket thing, he'd hit a switch and became upset. I don't get it. I spoke to a friend of mine that was also meant to go to it, and I guess she said something to him because he'd asked me not to ""get x & y on him"". I asked her, and she only said that bfs friend asked if she knew what was up with him and she said no. I'm confused. it's not even like I said I wasn't going anymore either, I just had doubts on it. I started to get ready when he asked me to, but I did send a message saying that I didn't want him to waste money on my ticket when I probably wouldn't like the day unless he was playing. all he said was ""I'm not forcing you"" and then proceeded to ignore my two messages after it. I'd sent a text later saying ""did you still want me to come"" cause there was never a point where I'd cancelled the day, just that I was feeling doubtful. and he responds with ""just left"" like huh??? what 😭 I wanted to be honest and that put us into our first issue that's lasted this long???

104,1dwjslk,AITA for taking a movie too seriously?,"me (F19) and my boyfriend (M19) decided to watch Suburbia (1983) tonight. both of us are modern punk and hardcore fans, and since this movie is about the punk scene in the 80s, it seemed like a great movie night. my boyfriend had already seen the movie, and described it as a lighthearted comedy with piss poor actors, but as we started watching it, a lot of the scenes in the movie really provoked me and left me thinking. 

while a lot of the movie felt outwardly misogynist and portrayed scenes of female abuse at the hands of the punk scene, my boyfriend let me know that it “couldn’t be misogynist, because a woman directed it”. this had me wondering why a woman would choose to portray the punk scene so violently and negatively, and really left me asking myself questions about the framing and narrative of the movie and what it said about the history of my subculture. 

i didn’t really find any of the jokes funny, but I’m not a very comedic person. i’m autistic, so a lot of jokes miss or don’t really make me laugh, even if i still enjoy the media they’re coming from. my boyfriend seemed disturbed that I didn’t find the movie funny, and he paused it to try and ask me what was wrong. He seemed irritated that I wasn’t seeing the movie as something light and comedic, and when I tried explaining that this movie was actually a hard watch for me and that I found it really interesting and compelling, he was discouraged. He said he didn’t want to watch the movie if I was going to overthink it, and even though I tried to explain that just because I wasn’t having fun watching it on a surface level I was still really interested by it, he seemed more focused on the fact that he had shown me a movie I didn’t enjoy the same way that he did. 

We decided not to keep watching it, but he became distant and wasn’t receptive to my trying to smooth things over. I’m worried that I hit a soft spot for him, or that I pushed things too far by trying to make a comedy movie about feminism and complicated literary interpretation.
Should I have just shut up and tried not to rock the boat?

105,1dwjnl4,AITA for being irritable towards my family?,"So earlier in the day I got up and like went upstairs to eat and stuff so I made my sister and I some food since she's 13 and probably didn't feed herself so that's in the air fryer for 15 minutes so I'm checking out what they're doing and checking in that they're taking care of themselves and such and mostly was talking about Celeste with my brother. So we do all that and my sister watches her show and before this she was up at 7 watching YouTube and between this I went back downstairs to hang out with my cats for a while and I thought it had been a bit so I went upstairs to ask if I could have a turn with the tv and at this time she started playing a game but I figured it might be ok to ask to use the tv since I was gonna play a multiplayer game so I wouldn't be hogging it so much. I asked and she said no so I asked why and she said that it was her game time (there's no schedules) so I said she used her time earlier to watch tv so she's had plenty of screentime but she got all pissy so I said she could do a few rounds and then I could play. 

She was getting irritated since she wasn't doing great at it (it was Pokémon unite) and started yelling and saying she wanted to kill the other players so I figured I could guide her so I'd say when her HP was getting low and should retreat but she'd ignore the advice and yell at me for talking and blame me for dying and sometimes would say this even if I was just talking away from her and get mad still. I backed off but I guess I let it get to me enough it was draining and I was starting to get irritable. 

After she rage quit I started playing the game with my brother and dad and that was nice but I guess it still drained my social battery a bit? Afterwards we left for an appointment for my sister and to go to a show for the 4th of July and my sisters were bickering in the car so I guess I let that get to me too and was a bit pissy about the loud music too. That's around when I started being snappy and telling them to calm down multiple times through the trip and then they'd say ""you calm down"". They'd ask why I was snappy and I told them I'm peopled out for the day and just need some time to myself but they said that's introverted to an unhealthy extent and that family doesn't count so I snapped and said ""well I'm sorry you guys are so draining"". 

I dunno, I should be able to regulate my emotions better than this but it's also a bit frustrating that somehow I'm supposed to not be affected by how much energy my family takes.

106,1dwjj30,AITA for talking bad about my sister and wanting my 17 year old sister to move out as soon as she can,"I've never really written one of these before but I think it would be a good place to kind of rant. I'm not sure if this is more of just a AITA rather than a yapping fest but anyways. The title might be misleading, so don't get me wrong I really love my sister but she can be VERY selfish. She is 17 and struggles to keep a job but always has time to go out with her friends, my parents recently put their foot down and told her that she needs to get a  job, she has been working one for a very short time now and I don't know how long her job will last but I hope it lasts so she can move out. But anyways my older sister will always be messing with my stuff and have anxiety of saying no to her so if she comes in my room and asks for something I really cant say no, it feels like im being manipulated some times. Ill just list some things for you. As and an FYI I am only a 13 year old girl (ik its too young for this app but idk what else to use) but first off, she will CONSTANTLY take my chargers, over and over, shes taken them so much that I' ve had to charge my phone using my computer instead of a block, once she took mine and gave me back a BROKEN one, shes got at least 6 of my charges ,that I had replaced over and over, in her car. Next, any time she has to drive me somewhere in her car I get a massive headache, she'll be driving us to dance class and she'll blast some random rap song about sex or something, once I even worked up the guts to ask her to turn it down because it was making me sick and she turned it down like one percent, does she even care? Also her car REEKS of nicotine or smoke or whatever you wanna call it, her car and her room are so nasty it makes me uncomfortable even being in there. Also I kept an XBox in my room and her and her bf once came in and asked to use it, I said sure, but I didn't expect them to literally UNPLUG the ENTIRE thing and bring it downstairs, and they didn't even USE it after that?! I've tried to hook it back up to my TV but now part of the cords are MISSING and I cant play on it anymore. Another thing she's done is once her and her friend came in my room asking to play with my slime that I had JUST made yesterday with the ingredients that I bought MYSELF, I said sure, they took the slime and MY shaving cream that I paid for...you know how I got it back? IN A PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE ALL DRIED UP! I spent MY hard earned money on that and that's what I get from it? Also, she takes my clothes ALL OF THE TIME, don't get me wrong I will also occasionally take her clothes, but you know what she has that I don't? Boobs. She stretches out my clothes so much! My tigger pants that I had bought for like 25 BUCKS with MY OWN money, yeah, she took them once, they sat in her car for EIGHT MONTHS and then I finally got them back. Also, anytime I get my clothes back, it smells like her room, which smells like nasty cheap perfume, I HATE it. Another thing shes done is make me cautious of what I wear, I wear more alternative clothes and a few times shes judged what I was wearing, so anytime Im dressed up I make sure to avoid contact with her so she doesn't laugh at me. Oh and also, shes made me HATE showers, Im always begging my parents to use their shower because shes made the bathroom DISGUSTING. The drain is constantly clogged with her hair, not just a little, A LOT like more hair in the drain than hair I have on my own head, her shavings on the wall, her eyelashes in the sink, and yes, we could all work on keeping the bathroom cleaner like my brother keeping toothpaste out of the sink or for me to stop putting my pads in the trashcan, but majority of the grossness is from my sister, she is SEVENTEEN and cant even pick up after herself in the bathroom, after I use my parents shower I ALWAYS take my hair out, but she cant? And once on I think my ninth or tenth birthday, totally ruined it for me, she made a scene because my mom caught her with a vape AGAIN, and she threatened to cut herself, so my mom put her in the car and brought her to the mental hospital, I had no idea that my mom was only threatening to send her there as a warning, I thought that she was actually going to leave her there for a while, so I was crying and crying while playing freaking roblox while typing to my friend in the chat ""this is the worst bday ever"" Also, another thing my sister does if FAKE mental illnesses, she made an entire tiktok about how she had BPD, asked my mom, she doesn't have it at ALL, also she said she was AUTISTIC. No girl, you are not autistic, I hate when people say that because I know kids who actually have it and they genuinely have such a hard time. Also once she went into my room and said ""can I borrow your headphones"" I was half asleep and didnt know what she said so I agreed, I left my room at one point and saw my headphones BROKEN in HALF on the chair next to my room, oh and BTW those were my FAVORITE headphones and the only ones that I liked because Im very picky and sensitive when it comes to things like that, and ALSO my bff was over that day and I almost CRIED in front of her as my parents tried to fix them. Thank goodness a few days later my parents bought me new ones, the same exact pair actually. But that leads on when she cant take a flipping hint, she came into my room and asked to borrow my headphones AGAIN recently, I made that one hesitating noise thing to basically say 'no' but she didnt take the clue and she was like pleaseeee, I wont break them, ill give them back, etc, she eventually took them and thank goodness I got them back in one piece. Also, my sister didn't take it as a red flag when her ex bf commented on 11 year old mes boobs? As and fyi, I barely had any just very very tiny ones, and they still are obviously small, but her bf had called me torpedo titties, that may sound funny but that's actually so weird wtf, and atp he was like 16 or 17 or something. Another thing is that she was given my moms friends old bearded dragon bc her kids wouldnt take care of it and she really loved it, she took care for like a week then just stopped and left him to eat his own poop, eventually though we moved him downstairs and my dad took care temporarily but then we gave him to my bff who loves reptiles to take care of and luckily she takes good care, but anyways, another thing is when I was like 10 and she was 14 she was going to sneak a boy in and for some reason told ME. I told her please dont, its stupid, and I was also scared my mom would catch her and shave her head...I know it's really random but that day I had watched and sssniperwolf video of a mom shaving her daughters hair as punishment but guess what happened when she snuck him in...my dad caught her and my mom CUT HER HAIR...What did I tell you? Luckily it wasnt bald but it was like neck length and she was growing it out too. But after her phone was taken and stuff we were at my uncles and I was playing on my tablet and she begged me to use it, she downloaded snap chat to text her little bf through a ten year olds tablet..? For her ages 13-15 were HORRIBLE, she would always be in trouble for being caught vaping and stuff, my parents would punish her by taking her door and phone they once even took her bed and just had her have a mattress. Once she even tried to run away because she was facing the consequences of HER OWN actions, she never ran away btw. But now shes gotten better, or actually idk if shes gotten better or if her bad behaviour just became so normal my parents just stopped caring? But, at least all the crazy yelling and arguing throughout that time has made me realize I don't ever wanna vape or smoke... Also something that still traumatizes me to this day is when she showed ELEVEN year old me a video her ex bf took while they were having sex... wtf... anyways, another thing is that she doesnt EVER pay my parents back for her car, my parents bought her a car and had expected her to pay off like half the price over time, shes only made like ONE payment from it because she can't EVER keep a job! These are just things that I can think of from the top of my head, this isn't even HALF of the stuff she's done, so yeah, I've talked trash about her to my friends and parents, and I think people are going to attack me for that, but can you blame me? I don't hate her though, she's still my sister, and I still love her, shes nice to me sometimes like a few days ago she bought me a milkshake from mcdonalds, and she doesn't really bully me, but she can just REALLY stress me out and agitate me.. And again, I would still miss her when she moves out but I feel like Id be less overwhelmed when she moves out, I mean, shes rarely home anyways, shes always out with her bf-- but, obviously I haven't ever told her that shes selfish or that Im happy shes almost moving out age, I still love her with all my heart but I just really needed to rant on how she stresses me out..

I told her please dont, its stupid, and I was also scared my mom would catch her and shave her head...I know it's really random but that day I had watched and sssniperwolf video of a mom shaving her daughters hair as punishment but guess what happened when she snuck him in...my dad caught her and my mom CUT HER HAIR...What did I tell you? Luckily it wasnt bald but it was like neck length and she was growing it out too. But after her phone was taken and stuff we were at my uncles and I was playing on my tablet and she begged me to use it, she downloaded snap chat to text her little bf through a ten year olds tablet..? For her ages 13-15 were HORRIBLE, she would always be in trouble for being caught vaping and stuff, my parents would punish her by taking her door and phone they once even took her bed and just had her have a mattress. Once she even tried to run away because she was facing the consequences of HER OWN actions, she never ran away btw. But now shes gotten better, or actually idk if shes gotten better or if her bad behaviour just became so normal my parents just stopped caring? But, at least all the crazy yelling and arguing throughout that time has made me realize I don't ever wanna vape or smoke... Also something that still traumatizes me to this day is when she showed ELEVEN year old me a video her ex bf took while they were having sex... wtf... anyways, another thing is that she doesnt EVER pay my parents back for her car, my parents bought her a car and had expected her to pay off like half the price over time, shes only made like ONE payment from it because she can't EVER keep a job! These are just things that I can think of from the top of my head, this isn't even HALF of the stuff she's done, so yeah, I've talked trash about her to my friends and parents, and I think people are going to attack me for that, but can you blame me? I don't hate her though, she's still my sister, and I still love her, shes nice to me sometimes like a few days ago she bought me a milkshake from mcdonalds, and she doesn't really bully me, but she can just REALLY stress me out and agitate me.. And again, I would still miss her when she moves out but I feel like Id be less overwhelmed when she moves out, I mean, shes rarely home anyways, shes always out with her bf-- but, obviously I haven't ever told her that shes selfish or that Im happy shes almost moving out age, I still love her with all my heart but I just really needed to rant on how she stresses me out.. Woah I just realized how much I typed- whoops..",,0.09747067093849182,0,0
107,1dwjh1w,"AITA for calling a guy miserable, short and bald because he called me the c-word?","
I just had the most infuriating encounter in Vancouver today and I need to vent. So, here's what happened:

I pulled into the first parking spot on the street (first parking spot, with another spot behind me), and as I got out, a blue Mercedes C300 convertible pulled in front of me. Even though my boyfriend got out of the passenger side, this guy immediately started yelling and waving his arm at him, shouting, ""Back up, f*cker!""

Confused, I stepped onto the sidewalk to see what was going on. The guy continued to berate us, swearing and demanding that we back up so he could park in our spot so he wouldn't have to parallel park even though he pulled up after we parked. At one point in his belligerent yelling he even said, ""I assume you would be polite and back up, but instead you're just a c*nt.""

It was shocking how he assumed he could demand things from strangers and get his way while being a total asshole about it. Maybe it's his privilege that led him to believe everyone must cater to his demands, expecting me to get back inside the car and back up just for him. If he had started the interaction with a simple, ""Hey, do you mind backing up?"" things might have gone differently. I wouldn't have had a problem helping him out if he had asked nicely. And if he doesn't know how to parallel park, just say it!

He directly assumed my boyfriend was the driver and told him to back up, probably because he couldn't fathom a woman being behind the wheel or making decisions. It's a classic case of entitlement and privilege—assuming his needs supersede ours and that women can't possibly be in control.

So naturally, after being called a c*nt, I was immediately shocked and enraged. I can acknowledge that my response was not great, but in response, I poked at what are probably a few of his vulnerable insecurities. I called him short and bald (no hate on bald, just aiming where it might hurt). If he called me a c*nt, I figured I might as well show him what a c*nt would say. I mean, this guy is probably full of hatred—after all, he picked up a personal-sized pizza and headed back into what I imagine is his lonely Friday night.

Not sure if he's used to doing this to people or if he's ever had anyone fight back at him, but I hope he thinks twice about going around calling women the c-word without expecting a fight back.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with entitled drivers in Vancouver or encountered this man before?

109,1dwiwgr,AITA- for wanting my bf to pay more ? ,"So. BF 27M and I 26F have been together for 6 years. Ever since the Pandemic my bf and his family has been going through a rough patch financially. Which is okay everyone has been going through a lot right now. My bf makes his income by delivering for various food apps or helping his dad with his business. But it’s reach a point where if I want to eat somewhere or go somewhere I tend to pay for the both of us and I’m kind of tired of it.

I’ve always had a stable income so I wouldn’t mind paying for my share of things. In the beginning of our relationship we used to be 50/50, and slowly transition to him paying for things like our dates, trinkets, food, etc. Now it’s flipped on me to pay for our outings and I feel uncomfortable when he would offer to pay for anything or split the bill. (Is this weird?)

Usually I initiate that we go somewhere (often times with my family) and I would end up footing the bill. He would promise dates or something but rain checks me and our outing would never happen. Or it would happen once in a blue moon. 90% of the time we would chill out my house and I can’t remember the last time we went on a proper date. 

Don’t get me wrong he shows his support where he can from helping my family, driving me to my appointments (hair, nails, tattoos), and is super reliable which is why I love him so much. And I’ve tried to talk to him about having a stable career but he brushes me off by saying “he has goals he wants to work towards”. 

I come from a long line of women being the breadwinners of the household. So I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic or insensitive. I’m trying to trust the process with him but I’m just tired of being the breadwinner in this relationship and I’m scared this is how our future will be.

I was diagnosed 5 years ago but nobody ever told me because they thought I didn't notice. I, of course, noticed and just thought there was something wrong with me but that's another story. 

One thing that I really struggle with and have struggled with for years is trying new foods. I eat a lot of healthy food but not an extremely wide variety. My mom made a spread with a lot of foods for dinner today. There was a truffle pizza, boiled eggs, chicken (just plain chicken sliced), cut up vegetables, a salad, her version of garlic bread, and maybe a couple other things on there. I've never had truffle pizza and don't really know what truffle is so that was a no, I don't like boiled eggs, I only eat plain chicken with ketchup and we were out of ketchup, so that pretty much left vegetables and a piece of bread soaked in olive oil. 

She knew I wasn't going to eat the meal stuff so she picked up a trader joes Mac and cheese for me on her way home from work. When I joined everyone for dinner, my sister (22f) asked why the bottle of salad dressing was on the table and my mom said not everyone likes that dressing (I only like it with ranch or some other dressing that my neighbor makes). My sister said they all know I'm the only one that doesn't like it and poured the dressing in the salad anyways. 

Then I was eating and my sister started talking about how I really shouldn't be eating the Mac and cheese and that the food my mom made is a lot better for me, especially considering my stomach issues (I have ulcerative colitis and she and my parents have been trying to convince me for years that if I just changed my diet id be able to cure my incurable condition and stop getting 8 weeks worth of medicine every 4 weeks). I told her if I wanted her opinion on my diet I'd ask for it and she kept going on about how she just wants what's good for my health and how rude I am.

Because of this, we often have a lot of stragglers even when we're already closed, which makes it really frustrating when I'm assigned to clean the bathrooms, especially because my bathrooms are literally right next to the park exit.

112,1dwi6cw,AITA for reporting coworker's unprofessional behavior to my boss?,"I (28) have been working at my company for almost a year. I have a coworker, Loopy (31) who has worked at the company with me for the same time - we are part of the same team and no one has a higher position than the other one. We previously worked together at another company, where I was a project manager and had to fix their mistakes and the owner would come to me to ask me to redo what they had done. Currently, they tends to micromanage my work, even though they lack expertise in my field. Despite attempts to resolve issues directly, Loopy's unprofessional conduct continues.

The problems include delays in workflow, where their involvement in every detail of projects leads to unnecessary delays. Projects that take me little time to do are held up for days due to their slow feedback. A lot of things had to be rushed or were not launched at all because they took too long. This is a consistent issue, happening with nearly every project and minor detail since they want to be involved in everything.

Additionally, Loopy often claims credit for work I’ve done, telling others they contributed significantly when they only provided negative feedback. For example, she has told our boss that they talked to clients or created documents that were entirely my work. They misrepresented accomplishments in a letter to our boss claiming they achieved things I did. In meetings, they frequently diminishe my individual contributions by presenting them as collaborative efforts, while taking full credit for their own work and not even mention my big contributions to them. I feel they just want to review everything to put their stamp on it and make it seem they contributed more than they did.

Loopy's conduct include gossiping about colleagues and speaking negatively about our boss. They have called another coworker “bitchy” and “bossy,” and has said our boss doesn't know what he is talking about and that the services the company offer are imposible to sell because the services are bad. They have also created a hostile environment by being dismissive of my feedback and making me feel discouraged from voicing professional opinions. For instance, when I provide feedback or disagree with their ideas, they responds with hostility and does whatever they want without taking my experienced opinion, making collaboration difficult.

Furthermore, they have deliberately excluded me from participating in events or special out of office activities. These exclusions are deliberate and not a simple oversight and I know it because they broadcasted the invitation to everyone except me. Their behavior has made it challenging to maintain a positive work environment.

The last drop was when they called me unprofessional. Something exploded in me after that and I have now reported all of these issues to my boss in a detailed letter. Nothing came from it really, but I feel that is because the boss don't have time. At the end of the day, he has a company to run; however, I think Loopy was told something because afterwards, they confronted me angrily, accusing me of trying to undermine them and minimize their contributions. I sincerely think they are afraid I take their job or that I stall their growth in the company which is outrageous because I don't want to do that and I don't really care about anything else but my own growth and contributions. Since then the process has changed a little and now I do not wait for Loopy's revision or feedback before I go to the final decision maker directly. They definitely are not okay with this and they have stopped speaking to me. This also includes not replying to the emails I send to them AND the boss for feedback or approval. Also another thing that happened recently is that I was trying to start a new project and asked them if a meeting with them and the boss ti what they replied that they didn't care about my opinions and why would I ask them anything if I am still going to do whatever I want.

At the end of the day is not that I dont want feedback, is that I don't think there should be these many layers between me and the final approver.

Loopy's behavior created a toxic work environment for a while, making me not care about anything that had to do with the company. I am usually a person that voices their opinions and I am always happy to work as a team and not being able to do so just because I just wanted to not make them angry put a weight on me and I started feeling unhappy, depressed and wanting to quit because I felt I had no growth opportunities in the company. Their behavior had been like that for months and I did make an attempts to address issues directly and diplomatically, but their behavior persisted.

They definitely are not okay with this and they have stopped speaking to me. This also includes not replying to the emails I send to them AND the boss for feedback or approval. Also another thing that happened recently is that I was trying to start a new project and asked them if a meeting with them and the boss ti what they replied that they didn't care about my opinions and why would I ask them anything if I am still going to do whatever I want.

At the end of the day is not that I dont want feedback, is that I don't think there should be these many layers between me and the final approver.

Loopy's behavior created a toxic work environment for a while, making me not care about anything that had to do with the company. I am usually a person that voices their opinions and I am always happy to work as a team and not being able to do so just because I just wanted to not make them angry put a weight on me and I started feeling unhappy, depressed and wanting to quit because I felt I had no growth opportunities in the company. Their behavior had been like that for months and I did make an attempts to address issues directly and diplomatically, but their behavior persisted.

Anyway, I guess I just wanted to vent a little and ask the Redditors on this board - AITA for reporting their behavior? Should I have done something differently? And what should I do now?",,0.01341156754642725,0,0
113,1dwi28r,AITA for cancelling my birthday plans because my friends have fallen out,"I (26F) have been really stressed about planning my birthday.

Liv (fake name) introduced her long term friends (one being Tom) to some newer friends (e.g, Elle). Elle started talking to Tom, and although was very clear she didn’t want anything serious started to get feelings for Tom. They would organise dates, but the dates never happened (from what I gather anyway).

After one night out, Liv and Tom hooked up. Liv felt terrible about it and told Elle straight away. 

Since then, Elle has completely cut Liv out her life and has told me she refuses to be in the same room as her.

Now it’s come round to my birthday, I’m kinda fed up with everything and just wanted to have smaller separate celebrations with Liv and Elles side of the friendship group separately. I told them both that I have cancelled my Saturday plans altogether (replacing them with midweek dinners out or movie nights). 

When I told Elle and her side of the group, they reiterated that they had left Saturday free for me. When I told them it was making me really anxious, and I have changed plans for everyone (in case they thought I was picking favourites), have all left me on read.

114,1dwhztp,AITA: I told my sister she has no friends or relationships because she is evil and selfish,"For context, I(27F) and my sister (25F) have always had a bit of a complex relationship. She’s the youngest and I’m the oldest (three girls in total!) all three of us are very close, often FaceTiming 4-6 times a day and sharing a lot of our lives with each other. We’ve gotten into arguments before because I have always felt she was a mean person (I.e., always wanting others to do for her but not wanting to reciprocate, easily irritated and often quick to talk down about others not like her, complaining a lot, talking to people in very rude ways). She feels that I am too sensitive and take everything personally. The basis of this blowout is below:

I invited my partner to my mom’s place with my mom’s permission and he would stay the night as he was driving 4 hours to come for the 4th of July. When I told my sister she got super irritated and told me she didn’t like that I invited him. I was put off, but I didn’t really say anything initially. The rest of the day went on but it was clear she was upset. Later on that night, I asked her directly if she was upset with me. 

At first she said “no I’m just tired” and then launched into saying that it was wrong of me to invite my partner over to stay the night without checking with her to see if she was comfortable with him staying. She also said she’s been annoyed because I kept bringing him up in conversations for no reason and felt that I was “forcing him on them”. I apologized for this and acknowledged that I should have checked with everyone before assuming they’d be cool with him in the house. I told her I only talked about him because I liked him and was happy with him and wanted to share in that with my siblings but if she wasn’t okay with that I’d stop. She got upset and felt I was being condescending and said “there’s a lot I could say but I’m not going to, it’s your relationship, so I don’t care”.  I said that she always says there’s more she could say and asked her to explain what she means by that. She then got more upset and told me to leave her alone. 

Here’s where I may be the ahole: I said “okay, I’ll leave you alone since you clearly need to be left alone”. I was frustrated with her and snapped a little bit. This comment apparently made her “black out” and she started yelling at me, calling me sensitive, saying this is why she doesn’t talk to me and why she doesn’t like me, and I told her that she’s mean and evil and I don’t like her either so we don’t have to talk at all anymore. Words were exchanged. I hit below the belt by telling her that the reason all of her friendships and relationships have ended is because she’s mean and makes everything about herself. She called me a fat a** b*tch and told me she hated me. 

I have apologized for my comments as I knew it was hurtful. She apologized too but insists that she blacked out, didn’t remember what she said, and only reacted that way because I “egged her on” with my passive aggressive comment.

For context, me and this person have only been friends for a few months but since than I feel like there's something weird about the way he teats particularly me. I'm unsure if it's due to immaturity (he's a few years younger than me) or the fact that he might be harbouring a small crush but he's been doing these small things that have built up over time and have made me come to resent him quite a bit.

For example, he told me infront of me and roughly 12 other people that his cousin could imagine me in a 🌽 video. This made me and his cousin visibly uncomfortable, with his cousin looking mad and imitately denying it and me telling him that that pretty disrespectful. He went of to tell the rest of us that his cousin was lying and he did say that whist hysterically laughing about what he said, (Thinking about him doing this makes me really mad and uncomfortable even now).

He also plays video games with me but likes to egg another friend of ours on to hold meaningless information from me that doesn't need to be held. Whilst saying backhanded things to me and than telling me it was a joke. These things have happened infront of our friends which I don't think they've noticed.

And whilst we were playing i had alot of particularly rare items and he decided to push me into a thing that kills alot of players while laughing as I freaked out. I managed to survive but bearly and he didn't even seem to care that much that I was upset as he said to our other friend ""I guess she's mad at me""

He accused me of sharing embarrassing pictures of him wearng a costume and when I denied it he very visibility didn't believe and seemed to hold it against me for a while. And told me a (m) friend of mine seemed to hate me (we bicker alot).

Everything had been going smoothly until earlier this week. On Wednesday when he came home from work and told me that Thursday would be his last day of employment at his current job, as his boss did not have anymore work coming in and he could not afford to keep him on any longer.   
It came as a huge shock and I automatically felt sick with worry about how we were going to be able to afford the household bills if he had no job.   
I told him we could sit down that night and look at what is out there and apply for anything and everything in order to get him employed again ASAP.   
This is when he told me he has no intention of looking for a job and ""working for just anyone"". I told him he was being ridiculous and that he obviously needs a job sooner than later as the household bills are not going to pay themselves and I am not in a financial position to be covering his portion of the household bills.   
This lead to him admitting that he had known for over a week that he would have no job soon and that he hadn't thought about looking for another job, as he was going to try and do cash jobs from home. When I looked at him dumbfounded, he started to get defensive, calling out the fact that I have changed jobs a few times in the last couple of years (due to schedule and custody changes with my older kids and lack of support). This lead to an even bigger argument where I told him to think logically at the fact that he was losing his job in the first place because people don't have the money to be going out and spending on non essentials right now. He told me I was being selfish for not supporting him.   
This irritated me, as it wasn't a matter of me being selfish at all.  I told him he was the one being selfish and was willing to risk the roof over the children's heads in the hopes of maybe getting some cash jobs here and there. I told him there was no guarantee and that is not something I am willing to support. 

I then told him that if he did not find a job and be able to continue to pay his share of the household bills, than he would need to move out in order for me to have someone move in who could do so.   
He told me I was being unreasonable and that it would mean he would not be able to have his older kids in his care anymore, as he would have to move to his mums, as thats the only place he would be able to go. I told him that was his problem and the consequences of his actions, or more so lack of action.

It had been resolved, but still irks me to this day if this was really my fault and something to apologize profusely for.

My boyfriend and I are servers and have quite nocturnal sleep schedules due to waking up before our 5PM shift and often leaving work 11-12PM during this time and then staying up later afterwards. For the winter break we didn’t have work, but of course this habit stuck with us and we would often wake up 1-3PM, latest 4-5PM and start our day from there. We would join the family for dinner and do some activities with them, and I would hang out with my boyfriend’s younger sister (F9) occasionally. More often we would chill and do our own thing in the guest room, like watching our own shows, hanging out, or doing work on our laptops with the door closed since it’s our break.

We stayed a maximum of 3 weeks with them and the night we were leaving to go back to our college town his mom completely flipped out at us and especially at me saying how disrespectful and borderline disgusting our sleep schedules and behavior was. How we didn’t do anything productive with our time or spend ample amount of time with the family (We spent plenty of time with them, but we also needed our alone time and space as well).

119,1dwhlq9,WIBTA if I asked for the family heirloom to be returned to the family?,"My husband's grandparents owned a beautiful Grandfather Clock. When his Gram passed, the clock went to their son. We have always had a close relationship with him and his wife, whom he married later in life, and they were basically surrogate grandparents to our kids, because they never had kids of their own. Sadly my husband's uncle passed away. We remained in contact with his wife, though admittedly we saw less&less of her because she would cancel plans. We could never seem to get our schedules aligned, but she made it to our son's birthday last year. We found out then that she had moved into an apartment & that her brother, sister, and friend helped her move,& even though several times in the 2 years prior my husband and I tried to help her declutter and organize some things​, she didnt ask us to help or even tell us she was selling the house. We assumed that she moved the Clock into the apartment w/ her. This past week she passed away. Her family didn't contact us to tell us she was in the hospital. Thankfully they did contact us to tell us she was moved to hospice,& we were able to visit her & even though she wasn't alert, we were able to tell her how much we love her,& say goodbye. While talking with her family, I asked her brother if they needed help with anything b/c my husband and I would like to help. He told me that everything was set with the funeral planning, and that they had emptied her apartment the week before. I asked, ""oh what happened to the clock then?"", thinking that they must have brought it to their home or put it in storage. Her sister spoke up & said that it was given to her friend's husband when they helped move her into her apartment. I said "" but it was supposed to stay in the family"" to which her brother said that was what she decided to do. Then the person who's husband has the clock said that she told him to ""just take it please"" To me it sounded like perhaps she didnt know how it would fit into the apartment and didnt know what else to do. She knew how much that clock meant to her mother in law, and how strongly it was felt it should stay in the family. I am concerned that the people involved in helping her move just didnt even think to ask her if any of her husband's family would want the clock. I cant imagine her just giving away the family heirloom of her husband to someone not in her husbands family. That isnt the kind of person she was. She loved us and our kids so much. I am hoping that since I spoke up in front of the woman that has the clock, perhaps she will realize that it should've gone to family & will willingly give it to one of the nephews. My heart is broken over the loss of my friend. I know the clock wont bring her, or my husband's uncle or grandparents back, and I know that it is just a thing but I really think it should belong to people that know the history of the amazing people that owned it.

WIBTA to ask them to return it?

EDITING: This whole thing was a moot point. Remaining uncle and husband are disappointed but feel that there is nothing to do about it. 

What I have learned in the last 10 hours is that some of you are very kind (thank you) and some of you are just pretty good at making people feel like crap. Whatever. you can think I'm an entitled asshole. I know who I am and that I'm a good person. And more importantly, my husband's aunt knows who I am. I dgaf  what the rest of you think of me. I really just wanted to see what other people thought about the situation and if there was a way to figure it out. 

I will be deleting post; no need to be tempted to see what other people want to say to make me feel crappy. Have a great day. Be kinder to the next person who asks WIBTA, and for goodness sake if something isn't clear maybe ask for clarification. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-06,"WIBTA if I asked for the family heirloom to be returned to the family? My husband's grandparents owned a beautiful Grandfather Clock. When his Gram passed, the clock went to their son. We have always had a close relationship with him and his wife, whom he married later in life, and they were basically surrogate grandparents to our kids, because they never had kids of their own. Sadly my husband's uncle passed away. We remained in contact with his wife, though admittedly we saw less&less of her because she would cancel plans. We could never seem to get our schedules aligned, but she made it to our son's birthday last year. We found out then that she had moved into an apartment & that her brother, sister, and friend helped her move,& even though several times in the 2 years prior my husband and I tried to help her declutter and organize some things​, she didnt ask us to help or even tell us she was selling the house. We assumed that she moved the Clock into the apartment w/ her. This past week she passed away. Her family didn't contact us to tell us she was in the hospital. Thankfully they did contact us to tell us she was moved to hospice,& we were able to visit her & even though she wasn't alert, we were able to tell her how much we love her,& say goodbye. While talking with her family, I asked her brother if they needed help with anything b/c my husband and I would like to help. He told me that everything was set with the funeral planning, and that they had emptied her apartment the week before. I asked, ""oh what happened to the clock then?"", thinking that they must have brought it to their home or put it in storage. Her sister spoke up & said that it was given to her friend's husband when they helped move her into her apartment. I said "" but it was supposed to stay in the family"" to which her brother said that was what she decided to do. Then the person who's husband has the clock said that she told him to ""just take it please"" To me it sounded like perhaps she didnt know how it would fit into the apartment and didnt know what else to do. She knew how much that clock meant to her mother in law, and how strongly it was felt it should stay in the family. I am concerned that the people involved in helping her move just didnt even think to ask her if any of her husband's family would want the clock. I cant imagine her just giving away the family heirloom of her husband to someone not in her husbands family. That isnt the kind of person she was. She loved us and our kids so much. I am hoping that since I spoke up in front of the woman that has the clock, perhaps she will realize that it should've gone to family & will willingly give it to one of the nephews. My heart is broken over the loss of my friend. I know the clock wont bring her, or my husband's uncle or grandparents back, and I know that it is just a thing but I really think it should belong to people that know the history of the amazing people that owned it.

WIBTA to ask them to return it?

EDITING: This whole thing was a moot point. Remaining uncle and husband are disappointed but feel that there is nothing to do about it.

124,1dwh746,AITA for sleeping while my family was out of the house?,"My parents (44f and 45m) told me (18x) that they and my sister (12f) were leaving for a few hours--about 7pm to 11pm--to shoot off some more fireworks that they didn't get to on the 4th of July. I don't really care all that much about fireworks and didn't shoot off many yesterday, so i decided I'd stay home. My parents were a little disappointed, but let me be.

I was taking a nap in my room when they told me they were leaving, so I was barely conscious of them leaving at all. From what my half-awake brain can remember, they didn't tell me to stay awake or anything.

Now, here's the real issue: our dog, D, doesn't like fireworks or thunder or rain. It always freaks her out. Our house isn't particularly clean and she tends to eat things she finds on the floor for whatever reason, so we keep her behind a gate in the kitchen most of the time. She isn't allowed into the rest of the house without supervision. She doesn't care too much about this rule when no one's around, though, because she'll jump the gate whenever she knows everyone's gone.

Basically, while my family was out and I was asleep, the fireworks must've spooked her and she climbed over the gate--genuinely don't know how, seeing as its over 4 feet tall because we made an extension for it since she could easily clear the 2 feet it was before--but because I was asleep still, I couldn't hear her. My parents got home at around 11:30 to find her eating cat poop from the litter boxes (and before anyone makes assumptions about that, no, she isn't underfed. My sister's chore is to feed and give water to the animals, and she does--even if she has to be reminded sometimes. D's 10lbs bag of food sits open on the ground next to her food bowl and she could easily stick her face in it or knock it over to eat if she really wanted to. Idk why but she just enjoys eating cat poop).

Anyway, my mom slams open my door and turns on the light to wake me up, and she immediately starts going off on me about how I ""haven't even left your room since we left, have you?"" and how the dog got out. I, having woken up not even 5 seconds ago, am very disoriented and can't formulate a response. After maybe 30 seconds of waiting for me to say something, she storms out, leaving me alone in my room again.

I'm writing this from my bed 45 minutes later, not wanting to leave because I don't want to get yelled at again. So, AITA?

TL;DR: the dog got out while i was asleep and my parents were out, and theyre upset at me because i didnt know she was out.

Edit: im pretty sure the dog actually peed on something while she was out last night because i can smell it. but apparently since my dad couldnt smell it when i brought it to his attention, the suspiciously grimy yellow paper towel and dish towels on the ground arent gonna be cleaned up (id clean it up myself if i wasnt super squeamish about that stuff. as in scarily close to vomiting squeamish) so yeah thats fun. i cant believe we fucking live like this",Not the A-hole,2024-07-06,"AITA for sleeping while my family was out of the house?

* PS3 controllers x2 (again, just sent me my console and games)

At the same time she wants me to give her back the like $200 monitored phone she made me use. This is on top of her taking one of my deceased fathers old cowboy hats without even asking me.

I've told her to her face I wanted to sue her over this, would I go through with it if I had the evidence? Honestly I can't quite say, but AITA for telling her that, or simply just wanting to do so?

Quick Edit because I forgot this: The lie she has told me several times is that my belongings are ""missing"" or ""were never even there."" I'm not going to get into her personal business but I will say her entire household went a while with little to no income, which can only lead me to ponder what she may have done with these decently expensive electronics.",0.0,-0.00011646444909274578,0,1
128,1dwgbtx,AITA for parenting another child after giving up my own? ,"To keep a long story short, I got pregnant when I was 15 and was forced to give the baby up. It was a very hard time in mine and my family’s life and we just couldn’t take care of another child at that time. My relationship with my mother became strained after this because she was also a foster child and had a rough childhood. My father was already working 3 jobs to provide for my family and I was not going to place more burden on him. Since I moved out at 18, I have been low contact with my mom but have a good relationship with my dad and siblings. 

I started dating my current boyfriend 3 years ago. He has a son from a previous relationship and I adore him. We have a good friendly relationship and I got along well with his mother as well. He lived full time with his mom a state over but would come visit my boyfriend on breaks, holidays, and long weekends. Unfortunately, his mother got into an accident and passed away about a month ago. His dad decided to take a week off of work to drive over to help his son pack up his things as he is going to start living with us. 

The other day I was catching up with my dad over the phone and I guess I was on speaker because when I was telling my dad about the situation and the fact that my bf’s son would start living with us, I heard my mom start yelling in the background. She said a lot of hurtful things but luckily I didn’t hear most of it because she was so loud that the speaker wasn’t catching what she was saying. The main things I caught in her fit were her saying that I was gonna go to hell for abandoning my daughter but taking in another child now and she called me a lot of inappropriate names that I don’t think I can put on here. 

I hung up the call in the middle of her fit and my dad texted me an hour later apologizing but I told him it wasn’t him who needed to apologize. I informed my whole family that I would be going no contact with my mom from then on and that if they wanted to celebrate any holidays with me then my mother would need to be excluded. 

I have wished everyday of my life since then that I had had the chance to keep my daughter. But I know that the life I would have given her would not have been the best.I understand where my mom is coming from, especially with her own trauma from the foster system and the things she said really hurt but I do see the sense in it.

129,1dwfs0i,AITA for wanting privacy after my baby is born,"I 30 (F) am pregnant with my second baby, he is due September 21st. Just for alittle back story, my husband 30 (M) is from Brazil and we have been married for 6 years.

My husband’s family all still live in Brazil, we typically visit them once a year and they visit us once a year for at least 2 weeks or sometimes around a month. I know these visits are very important for my husband so I always try to be flexible and understanding even though the trips always take all my PTO and when his parents come here they stay at our house the whole time. 

Here’s where I am having a problem, my husband just came to me and said that his parents are coming to stay at our house for Christmas and New Years (2 weeks). I will be freshly returning back to work from maternity leave and I know it’s going to be a very sensitive time for me with high emotions. My husband cannot wrap his head around this and does not seem to care. 

I told my husband it would be one thing if they came here and could stay at a hotel or something but since they will be staying at the house that the timing will be a lot for me, trying to navigate going back to work with a new baby. I am not someone that really wants a ton of help, I more so enjoy my privacy. I already have a son (3 years old) so I have an idea of how it will be. 

There is also a language barrier, they speak Portuguese while I speak English. If they have the baby, it’s hard for me to be able to communicate anything to them and my husband is not the best at it. I just feel emotional about this and somewhat uncomfortable because I know myself and I know that so fresh after adding a new addition to the family I am just going to want privacy and to be with my babies. 

My husband did not come and discuss this with me either, he just came to me and said they are coming for Christmas and New Years. I wish he would ask how I feel about it or try to at least discuss it with me. 

Side note- This pregnancy has not been easy on me so far, I have been in and out of the hospital with kidney stones so this problem is adding extra stress/anxiety that I do not need right now. 

AITA and am I over reacting? Or do I have valid reason to be upset?

131,1dwfnor,AITA for setting boundaries with my friend-colleague for when she can text me? ,"I (29F) work with my assistant (54F) and she's not very tech savvy. So I often help her order stuff online and she pays me back cash, no issues.

However, she recently got her bonus and has been sending me multiple links of what she wants to buy. I have no issues with helping her purchase them. My issue with it is 1) she was sending me these 20-30+ messages from 5-8am on a weekend 2) I've helped her look at her finances before and have advised her on focusing more on saving so she can afford to retire. So honestly, I don't think she should be blowing ~10% of her paycheck EACH time she goes on a buying spree. She mostly lives paycheck to paycheck too. 

I politely asked her to refrain from texting me during sleeping hours 11pm-8am, and also offered to teach her how to link card/online shops as I'm uncomfortable with having to keep reminding her to spend prudently. 

After telling her that, she apologised, said that she will no longer seek my help for anything and delete my number and the online shopping app. My main issue now is that she seems to want to cut all ties and doesn't want to have any form of friendship at all.  

I'm afraid of how this may impact our working relationship and am also concerned for her wellbeing as she's not tech savvy and I've previously helped her with many things like ordering furniture, renew her passport and utility bills.

They are upset that I did not communicate with them and that I am not obeying their world when as Christian’s we should not be associating with these ‘worldly’ activities. They have let me know that I am hurting their feelings by not understanding that me going is putting me in danger and causing me to sin, that they are only looking out for me and don’t want me to go down a path that could damage my relationship to god.

My extended family seem to understand my side, that I want to do something for myself without my parents breathing down my back about it, but my parents don’t see it that way and now there are tensions when the family is together because I have been firm in my stance and my parents have said that they will do everything they could to stop me from going.

AITA for not consulting them in this and now they are upset because I have not canceled and have been saying no to them about it as well as having my siblings have to pick up the slack of me not participating in the house as much?",,-0.004889324307441711,0,0
135,1dweka6,AITA for not telling my bf what was bothering me during the 4th of July?,"I 20f and my 19 bf have been dating for over a year. We've had issues with communication as he can get very angry very quickly and i tend to hide my feelings before i'm ready to talk about them.

9 months ago he had a friend, M, who he was receiving snapchats from. I'm not a jealous person so I didn't think anything of it. M is just his type and he had said he had a crush on her in the past but it never happened and she was sending him pics where she was putting in a lot of effort into them with lighting and makeup and all that. I made a joke calling M his gf and he knows i'm jk but still he then offers to stop snapping her as they only really snapped once in a while anyway i say yeah why not if it's not some big ask. 

 went to a friends lake house for the 4th of July. We been drinking heavily and I went to see the time on his phone and noticed he had snap notifs from M so i went to see what they were- i never snoop through his phone cause I trust him- there was nothing but then noticed they had paragraphs from months earlier: He said that I said they couldn't talk anymore that he's so sorry that he misses their deep conversations and that he wishes he could have been a better man to her. she goes on to say how much she misses him and that she cherishes the understanding and comfort that she received from him and then goes on to say ""some people"" have such restrictive boundaries set on their partners and he agrees with her. She goes on to say shes so grateful for him and that she loves him and hopes that one day they can begin again with the deep conversations and the beautiful friendship that they had. He says that he hopes so too and that from time to time he'll sit back and think about switzerland and that she's truly a beautiful person inside and out and he's grateful for their time together.

He never told me how close their friendship was and I wouldnt have broken two people apart like that had i known how connected they were. That being said, am I crazy for feeling weird about this? on one hand i'm like why didn't he tell me how connected he was to this girl after being the one to suggest that they stop talking. i'm hurt that he would say i'm being restrictive.

I hid my sulking because I didn't want to ruin his night by bringing this up. before bed he says that he can tell somethings not right so i tell him the gist but that i want to talk about it on the car ride home in the morning. He starts getting super pissed and following me around and i decide i'm going to sleep and i'm not having the conversation till i'm sober and ready to say how i feel about this. The next morning we have the conversation and he starts really yelling at me for not having told him immediately and that I need to better myself because I don't put work into myself after he's put loads of work in trying to be nice to me and not take his anger out on me.

136,1dwe770,AITA for not allowing my stepchildren to move in?,"My wife has 6 children who were 18+ when we met 4 years ago. I have no bio kids. 

2 years ago, the youngest daughter moved in. The dynamic between her and my wife created tension in the house. Additionally, the daughter didn't believe she should work, provide for herself, or go to college/trade school. She eventually moved out of state to live with friends because they let her “cook and clean and not work”.

Months later, the oldest son moved in after discharge from the military. The same weekend, his wife and two young kids also moved in. A week later, he decided to move cross country, leaving us to provide for his family.

9 months ago, my wife and I moved out of state (alone). After 4 months, we took in the oldest son's 4 y/o out of concern for his safety. This arrangement may be long-term.

Recently, the middle daughter asked to move after breaking up with her bf. I said no. The oldest son suggested moving in, potentially helping with his son. I said no. 

Last night, the youngest daughter asked to move in again. She found a room to rent after her friends decided to move to another apartment without her. While at the room, she “heard screams from her upstairs neighbor and called the cops.” She was scared and left. I said no. Now she and the oldest daughter aren't speaking to my wife.

Additional context: I'm self-employed, relatively new business and the sole provider. Taking in the 4 y/o has been quite an adjustment -draining- but he’s a great kid.

I feel some of the stepchildren judge my wife, because we live well, and think she should do more for them.

Honestly, I don't want to take on the responsibility of others decisions. I'll assist in solutions, but don't want to be the solution. I've helped in other ways like paying rent, but drew the line at moving in. 

AITA?

UPDATE: There are many requests for my wife’s POV in all this. My wife wants to rescue them in any way she can AND she does not want any of them to live with us. It’s the paradox of being a mother. 

UPDATE 2: My wife just shared with me that over the last month, she has been helping the youngest daughter find housing and employment near us. She found great options, even applied to some places on her behalf. The oldest son also invited her to live with him so they could share expenses. She declined.

137,1dwe22r,AITA For Telling My Boyfriend I Thought An Animated Character Was Attractive?,"I, 24F, have been dating my boyfriend, 25M, for almost three years. Before now, our relationship had been going very smoothly. No major fights, no jealousy, no reason for distrust. He had my social media passwords and I had his; we had nothing to hide because we trusted each other.

My boyfriend and I met at a gaming convention in our city. Video games play a huge part in not only our lives, but the relationship as well. My boyfriend loves games like Fortnite and Overwatch while I enjoy more RPG-like games such as Pokemon and Persona 5. My boyfriend and I like to play games together, and also watch each other play games. One day, I was playing Persona 5 and I made a throwaway comment about one of the characters, Goro Akechi. I said ""He's kinda fine, not gonna lie.""

I thought the comment meant nothing. My boyfriend, however, stood up and left the room without saying a word. I thought it was a little odd, but didn't think much of it and kept playing. My boyfriend didn't return to the room for the next two hours while I played. After I finished playing I went straight to bed because it was late and my boyfriend wasn't in the bed.

The next morning I woke up to the sound of things being moved in our house, a truck backing into our driveway, and people talking downstairs. I immediately noticed that none of my things were in the bedroom, and there were cardboard boxes stacked neatly in the corner. I went downstairs and lo and behold, everything I owned was being packed up and put into boxes by a fleet of movers. A lot of things were already packed, so the movers were just moving the boxes out and into the UHaul that was waiting outside.

When I asked one of the movers what was happening, he told me that they were called to move my things out and into another house, which turned out to be my mother's place. I had no idea what happened, as I forgot about the comment I made the night. Fortunately, my boyfriend had left a note on the counter explaining his decision.

He talked about how he felt underappreciated in our relationship and how my comment the night prior was just the sign he needed to know I would be unfaithful. He told me to not bother contacting him, as he was breaking up with me and kicking me out of his house. My keys were on the counter with the note, and the housekey was removed from the ring. Perfect.

Now I've been living with my mother, unsure about what's going on, none of my texts going through to any of our friends. AITA?

138,1dwe0hj,AITA For not going with the funeral home my aunt wanted??,"So my grandma just passed away, she had no life insurance, it was very unexpected. Two of my great aunts, Aunt B and Aunt Lea, who was my grandfather’s sisters, were trying to help find a funeral home willing to work with us. I called many. There was one funeral
home named Memory Garden, that was 1400, just for cremation. My family was all willing to donate. They wanted over 2k more for a small service. I tried calling them myself and they were extremely rude, no compassion. If you work in a funeral home you need compassion IMO. Well I kept calling around and I called the funeral home who had helped us before. They were extremely nice, said they could do the cremation and do a small memorial for 1400. That was actually the funeral home my grandma wanted. Well I called Aunt B, one of the aunts, told her and she seemed okay. Then I find out from Aunt Lea that Aunt B is mad that we didn’t go with the funeral home she wanted. And that she and the 4 family members she called would not be donating. 

She then put a long post on facebook about how she set up a funeral for 3 days and that my mother decided to change the venue to accommodate her friends. We had never agreed on Memory Garden. Ever. I tried to call her she wouldn’t answer. Aunt B said she told her she texted us but we never got it. And we didn’t change the funeral home to accommodate anyone! We went with who gave us the best deal and in my opinion the most compassion.

If we had went with Memory Garden we would have paid the same price and had to find somewhere for a memorial.
