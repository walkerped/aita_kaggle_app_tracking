0,1dxcsql,AITA for leaving to go to a family event even though it's never been a problem before?,"Okay so for a bit of context, I 16f usually help my mom with pet sitting. She does it as an extra job, and sometimes takes on more than one at a time. Everyone she pet sits for is aware that I might fill in for her, and they are completely fine with that. If they aren't. She is the only person who goes over. 

There is a man that she pet sits for who lives only about a 2-minute walk from our house, and he is totally fine with me, my brother 18m, and my brothers boyfriend 18m, pet sitting for him.

The last two times I was over there it was me and my brother's partner who we will call Michael. Sometimes depending on our schedules, I will go over with Michael and be there for about 2 hours, and then he will have to leave for something, but I will still be there. That has never been a problem. 

Today, Michael and I went over there at about 11:15 a.m., and I had to leave for a family barbecue at 1:00 p.m.. he and I were watching a movie when my dad got there to pick me up, so I left. 

My brother who we will call Damien came over only a few minutes after I left. So the dogs were never alone, Michael was there the entire time. 

The man who we will call Steven was supposed to be home around 3:30. He suddenly barged in at 2:30, and began yelling at both my brother and his boyfriend. Saying that he was tired of the revolving door of all of us, sometimes being there sometimes not. 

My brother and Michael tried to explain that the dogs were never alone, Michael had been there the entire time, and just because I left didn't mean anything. 

Steven then said that next time he wants it to just be me there. Just me the whole time. No one else. That made me really uncomfortable when Michael told me that. Bc I'm a 16-year-old, and he's definitely anywhere from late '40s early '50s. 

Both me and my mother have a little bit of an inkling that Steven was more so mad because Michael is a trans man. Steven has never said anything bad, but he does have conservative newspapers around his house and stuff like that. 

Also, when he came in and began yelling at Michael and Damien, he brought up the fact that he had never met Michael before. They had met more than five times at this point.. And even had a 10-minute conversation before so I don't know what he was on. 

He was mostly just pissed that I wasn't there anymore, and that Michael apparently had never introduced himself, even though I was with him when he did the first time they ever met.

I'm wondering if maybe I was the asshole for leaving when he didn't know I was going to, but I can't see how that's a possibility when the dogs were never alone, and he has established that he is okay with my brother and his partner watching his dogs.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-07,"AITA for leaving to go to a family event even though it's never been a problem before?

1,1dx71oy,UPDATE - AITA for refusing to replace a picture I posted with an edited version of it?,"I decided to follow your advice. A few days after I first posted here, I removed the picture. My post on Instagram now looks exactly the same as it did before my father made me include his girlfriend.

I did so because she was still asking me to switch the pictures. She had begged, sent me an alternate version in which she ""only edited herself"" (lie, everyone's teeth were still whitened) and tried to guilt trip me about it. I consider myself to be a very patient woman, but I do have limits.

That's when I removed the picture. I think she was checking my post, because she texted me about an hour later asking why I'd changed it. I reminded her I'd promised to remove the picture if she didn't accept the unedited one.

My father later tried to convince me to repost it, but I told him I'm not doing that again. When he protested, I told him to stop and think about the fact that he was complaining about a social media post on a private account. I think he did, because he apologized for the drama and stopped bringing it up.

I did get a few more texts from his girlfriend asking me to reconsider, to which I replied that since she doesn't want any real depictions of her online, I will never include her on my social media again. I think she's still upset, but she's no longer bothering me about it.

Also, I took the opportunity to remind all parties that only me and my husband are allowed to post pictures of our child online. Just in case.

2,1dx5mgs,AITA for confronting my now ex-friend after they kept trying to out me and even outed me a few times?,"(Throwaway acc)

I (17M) am transgender. I was born female and now identify as male. When I was fifteen I met my now ex-friend (17NB). I and this friend grew close rather quickly. We texted and hung out a lot and I grew comfortable around them. When we were sixteen I came out to them as being transgender and told them my chosen name.

They were excited and the first thing they started talking about was to tell everyone. Friends, teachers, random people I would introduce myself to, even my mother who I had made clear to them doesn't accept people who are transgender. I was quick to reject these Ideas as wasn't ready.

This didn't stop them. Through the next month, they'd nag me and constantly tell me to ""just do it."" I kept telling them no. But they refused to stop and it got to the point where they threatened to tell our friends themself if I wouldn't. I caved in and I came out to our friends over text. this behaviour continued and they ended up telling our social teacher. They had been nagging me about telling her and they kept ""offering"" to tell her for me and I said yes.

It had taken me five months before fully confronting them, they had been gone for a trip and I texted them. Not about this but another problem with them using my iPad and downloading certain types of inappropriate fanfics. I started with small problems and I planned to talk about the big issue when they got back in person but I didn't get that opportunity. I had a friend who had problems with them and she started texting them about everything.

It was later that night when I got a long text from them, angry at me for talking to our friend about my issues with them and telling that friend about rude things they had said about her. I got angry and I texted them about every single problem, including this one. They apologised and they said things like ""I never plan to come out."" ""Coming out over text doesn't seem like a big deal for me."" ""These issues were months ago."" ""This isn't fair to me."" This pissed me off and I got really angry and I swore, and yelled, and said that it wasn't a good response and wouldn't be friends with them anymore. I know the way I went about it was rude, I had said things like ""How dare you."" ""Good for you, you got good experiences! I didn’t"" ""You were lucky for getting support, I wasn't"" And I shouldn't have said these things because they don't have full support and I essentially dismissed their struggles with my words.

They pulled away from any mutual friends we had and they claim it's my fault for making them lose other people even though I only discussed these issues with one mutual friend and a friend who was my own. I have heard them call me and our mutual friend's assholes amongst other things and they completely blame me.

3,1dx4m6g,AITA for telling my brother he's the worst person ever to exist?,"I am the only child between my parents. My mother has 2 sons from a previous marriage and my dad has 1 son from his previous marriage. The brother that I'm talking about is from my moms first marriage, call him Jack. My dad raised Jack, all of us kids equally, always took care of us. My dads family was the only family who Jack knew, they never treated him differently, never. Everyone was always together, celebrated holidays, birthdays etc...Fast forward twenty years, my parents announce that they are going to get divorced. Which is fine, wasn't a secret. We were all grown up and out of the house at this point anyways.

Which Jack decides to announce that as our parents are getting divorced, he's no longer part of the family. He's divorcing everyone too! The whole family who took care of him,he just decided they weren't his family. Just like that, poof. Cut everyone who ever cared about him off, except for our mom. Which the communication between them was poor at best. 

I had still tried to reach out to him and his family. He ignored me, until one day he asked me to meet him for lunch one day, where he looked me dead in the face and point blank told me that we had NOTHING in common and he would like it if we were strangers on the street.

Two years later, my grandmother dies. Everyone tried to get ahold of him for him to at least come and pay respects to the only grandmother he has ever known. Crickets. Another two years goes by and no-one has heard a peep out from him and my uncle falls ill and passes away and this is where things get tricky.

Uncle is in hospice, very ill and Jack magically shows up! Coming to visit Uncle, talking to family members, like everything is fine. I didn't know of this until my cousin told me sending me a screen shot of a text he had sent her. Which in return I took his phone number, texted him and told him to leave her alone and how Uncle didn't like him and how he divorced the family, he stepped out, he had no rights. He texted me back, begging to meet and explain. I agreed.

I wanted him to say something, anything.I asked him what we were doing there, what he did he have to say? He said nothing,I tried to understand. Instead he let me sit at the bar and fully cuss him out and tell him how hurtful his actions were on the family. Not showing up to grandmothers funeral but visiting uncle in hospice? (Uncle hated him, btw) After YEARS of silence. He said NOTHING. So I sat and told him exactly what everyone thought of him. Not sure what he was expecting, after begging to explain his actions to me and stayed silent the whole time. I told him how much I hated him and how he was the worst.

Next morning, I get a long text message from my dad about how upset my mom is with me, how I had the nerve to say what I said to Jack. Jack called my mom the next morning and had told her and complained about what I said.

Anyways, my dad has anger issues. He always had them for as long as I could remember. I go out of my way to spend as little time around him as possible. despite this, I get yelled at 3-7 times a day. So I spend all my time in my bedroom to keep that on the low end.

Lately he has been getting mad that I had been spending my time upstairs in my bedroom, locked away not socializing. I told him that my brother (19M) is sleeping or playing Roblox upstairs and Mom only speaks Spanish (I don't) and is also upstairs 24/7.

He then changes to how he never really talks to me any more and that if I keep playing video games or whatever then I will regret not spending more time with him and to stop being selfish. I then tell him that he never wants to hang out anyways and that he is also in his bedroom all the time.

(Not important but he tells me to not say ""hang out"" but ""spend time together"" because that is proper way to say that.)

Anyways he then lays into me for not responding to him shouting up the stairs. I tried to tell him the my window opens up to the highway so I can barely hear him and with the fan on, it's worse. (Hot summer days are hot. It's July Man.)

He then tells me that from now on starting tomorrow, I must be downstairs on the couch, from 9AM to 6PM and doing something that is not reading, on my phone or video games.

When I told him that this is not fair and what should I even do, he tells me that I should have not had my window open or the fan on and that it would not be an issue if I stayed downstairs and that I could play board games.

I told my only friend on discord and she told me that I was an A-Hole and that I would not be yelled at unless I was doing something wrong and that I should just suck it up. I told my brother and he just told me it sucks to suck.

Lately he has been getting mad that I had been spending my time upstairs in my bedroom, locked away not socializing. I told him that my brother (19M) is sleeping or playing Roblox upstairs and Mom only speaks Spanish (I don't) and is also upstairs 24/7.

He then changes to how he never really talks to me any more and that if I keep playing video games or whatever then I will regret not spending more time with him and to stop being selfish. I then tell him that he never wants to hang out anyways and that he is also in his bedroom all the time.

(Not important but he tells me to not say ""hang out"" but ""spend time together"" because that is proper way to say that.)

Anyways he then lays into me for not responding to him shouting up the stairs. I tried to tell him the my window opens up to the highway so I can barely hear him and with the fan on, it's worse. (Hot summer days are hot. It's July Man.)

He then tells me that from now on starting tomorrow, I must be downstairs on the couch, from 9AM to 6PM and doing something that is not reading, on my phone or video games.

When I told him that this is not fair and what should I even do, he tells me that I should have not had my window open or the fan on and that it would not be an issue if I stayed downstairs and that I could play board games.

I told my only friend on discord and she told me that I was an A-Hole and that I would not be yelled at unless I was doing something wrong and that I should just suck it up. I told my brother and he just told me it sucks to suck.

AITA for wanting to stay in my room for as long as possible or is he the A-Hole for for demanding me to be downstairs for socialization when there is no one to talk to?",0.0,-0.0008288168,0,1

My parents, especially my mom, have been really pissed at me for sleeping in and waking up at 10 am or 12 noon because ""a normal human being doesn't wake up at that time"" and my mom has been screaming at me fot gaming at night because I should be studying for some stupid government exam they want me to take next month (which i don't even want to take in the first place cause i already passed the first level of that exam and barely even studied for it so why bother studying for this other one yk when it legit just has the same coverage but is just slightly longer) and to start studying for my board exam next year. My parents are also your typical strict Asian parents fyi. I'm also graduating with a bachelor's degree in Psychology and they want me to get an office job in HR or something and to work for the government because there's apparently more money there but I really don't want to because I hate being confined in a tiny space and doing the same shit every single day in a boring office and I sure as hell don't want to work for for the government. Financially, I'd say we're comfortable too, since my mom's a doctor and my dad's an engineer and has a business on the side, and I'm literally an only child, so it's confusing why they're rushing me so much to get a job already. I just wanted at least two months to take a break from studying because all I did was study non-stop in my 4 years of university, since we never had a single summer vacation because of the pandemic and had to rush through classes so we could ""graduate on time"". I just wanted to take a little breather before finding a job but apparently me wanting to sleep in and playing video games during my spare time makes me a ""childish and irresponsible brat"" (my mom's actual words) so does this really make me the asshole?

EDIT: I'd like to clarify. I live in Asia, and my parents are really strict to the point that they berate me and shit even for the simplest things like having the dogs inside the house or adding too much spice in the food I cook. My mom's also the type of person to tell me that, ""you're useless"" or ""nobody will love you but us"" and my dad even physically hurts me to the point that I've been covered in bruises and had to leave home. My mom also legit throws temper tantrums and throws glasses or plates when things don't go her way, so yeah, my home life isn't the best. I've begged them to get therapy but they say that it's normal to fight in families and that my family is completely normal.

I actually have been working on my resume, other important documents, and have been looking for jobs and am trying to apply. I haven't been sitting around just doing nothing because I really do plan to move out. My mental health has been in shambles and I don't have the best support system so I sleep so I can feel peaceful in this house and I play when I can because that makes me happy and even how little this sounds, it helps keep me alive. Even playing with my dogs gets my mom riled up because I love the dogs more than her (well yeah no shit, i got diagnosed with ptsd, depression, and anxiety because of her years of abuse)

9,1dx3vlx,AITA (21f ) for not taking care of my brothers (26m) cat while he is out of town?,"Hello everyone! I’m sorry if this is long it kind of has a lot of context but here we go. Also all fake names! 

For some background, a few years ago when I started sleeping over with my bf my brother Will (26m) vehemently told me he would not feed my cat when I slept away from the house. So I spent hundreds finding a feeder for my cat because she only eats wet food due to her age. 

Fast forward to 2 years later. My brother now has a gf and often goes to stay at her house for the weekend and will often not inform or ask me or my mom to care for his cat. I have brought this up multiple times that it is his responsibility and he needs to at least ASK. It’s gone like this for a few months of me refusing and my mom picking up his slack. 

This weekend, apparently Will went with his gf about 5 hours away for a job. My mom is also out of town this week. I’m already taking care of most of my mom’s responsibilities while she is away and my brother did not tell me when he was leaving or anything. Today I get a text at 11am of my brother asking for me to feed his cat. I am in the service industry but have a set schedule and I work every weekend. When Will messaged I was already at work so I said that; as well as a message saying it was disrespectful to assume me or my mom will do it for him. He just brushed me off. 

I get home at about 6:30 today, do a few things, then feel bad because I really don’t know when the last time Will’s cat ate. So I go in the room and feed him a can. As I am doing that Will arrives home and makes a comment about me just feeding the cat “as he shows up” 
This makes me frustrated and I kind of go off (not yelling but definitely mad). I tell Will again that it is rude to not ask someone until it’s too late and that his cat is his responsibility. Will says “I checked your location and it said you were at home when I texted you” I was not at home I was at work since about 10:30 this morning. Will then accuses me of lying saying that I probably waited until I did get to work to answer him. 

I have screenshots of the time stamps is anyone would like to see. And luckily I am moving out in a few months. So am I the asshole for not taking care of my brothers cat while he is out of town?

10,1dx3v14,AITA for leaving my kids with my mother instead of my ex MIL?,"I (26F) recently split from my ex husband. Our relationship wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t a love marriage. I was disowned at 18 for drug use and ended up pregnant by a much older man. He insisted I marry him and I did so I wasn’t homeless. Not the best foundation for a marriage.

I spent the next 7ish years having three kids, and being a mother to his two daughters from his first marriage. I had no time for myself.

Now that we’re split up, I leave my kids with my mother sometimes so I can do things for myself. My mother insisted that I picked up a hobby so I’ve been learning to swim and I’ve been taking classes at a community college. I also take a ‘personal’ day sometimes just to get my hair done or read a book. I was hesitant to be away from my kids so often at first but my mother says I need it and I’ve been feeling better about myself. 

A massive issue that arose when I left my husband was how often his mother would be able to see our kids. She used to come over to the home I shared with my ex almost daily to see our kids but now I live with my mother. I told her that I would always try my best to make sure she sees them often but I haven’t been if i’m being honest, which is why I’m the asshole. I’ve been so caught up in my nee hobbies and studies that I’ve been leaving my kids with my mom all the time instead of calling her up to see if she can watch them.

She saw me out three days ago and asked where the kids were. I told her they were with my mother and we got into a massive argument because she hasn’t seen them in the past six weeks. She called me a massive asshole for going back on my promise.

I feel terrible but Im also just kind of confused. My mother barely saw my kids until recently but she saw them everyday. I know it’s not an excuse since I made a promise but I’m at a loss. She is extremely upset with me and my ex called me and basically yelled at me for lying to his mother. AITA?",Not enough info,2024-07-07,"AITA for leaving my kids with my mother instead of my ex MIL?

11,1dx3qj9,AITA for cutting off my son?,"For starters I have not taken any steps as of yet, but can’t decide if I should. 

My son 18M and I 36M are currently not speaking. His mother 40F and I have been together 10 years and married for 2 1/2 months. 

We have our fair share of disagreements, and recently had a rough one the other night. We shouted back and forth for a bit about the amount of time each other spends on their phones, not spending enough time with each other, and so on.

This all culminated with her telling me she’d smash my phone and being the typical arrogant jerk I am I tossed it to her and dared her. She threw my phone on the floor and attempted to smash it to no avail.

My other son 16M had his sisters (12F and 9F) in his room at the far end of the house due to the argument, and I decided it would be best to just get away from the whole thing. I took my girls and went to the store to just separate from my wife and let us both cool down.

Shortly after I got to Walmart my son called me screaming at me about hurting his mother. He was screaming that I had hit her and threatened her and she called him to come pick her up and take her to her mom’s. I tried to explain that he was wrong for about 20 seconds, but he got increasingly loud and disrespectful so I just told him that he was my son and wouldn’t talk to me like that. I asked him to call me back when he has a cooler head.

TO BE CLEAR I DID NOT PUT HANDS ON MY WIFE. She told my son I threw my phone at her which she later admitted was a lie.

Well since then he hasn’t been home (he lives with us) and has not answered a single call or text. This in and of itself is very disrespectful in my eyes, but there are several obligations going on that require our communication. Such as his new car and insurance (In my name), selling his old car, etc.

I have given it about a week and call it what you will, but I’m pretty much done with waiting. I sent him a message saying that any issue he has we can talk about or work out, but he needs to at least reach out to me.

He has his own job and makes his own money. He has never nor will I ask him ever to pay any sort of home bills. He lives/lived completely off my dime up until he stopped coming home. This is with the exception of an iPhone that he recently financed after losing the 13 I provided him with

I was raised kind of old school and my way of thinking is, if you want to be a man and completely write me off you can go pay your own way. 

Here is what I am wrestling with doing:

Take his car
Suspend his phone service
Remove him from the family Apple 
Take him off of my Credit Card

I have no intentions of kicking him out or otherwise making my home unavailable to him, but if you’re too grown to talk to Dad, you are also too grown for his money.

13,1dx3ko1,WIBTA if i told my sister to stop being so clingy with my bf?,"Ok guys so me (nb17) and my bf F (m15) have been together for about 2 months now but have been best friends for about a year and a bit. My sister, M (f14), has also been friends with him for the same amount of time. F is a trans man and I am non binary and we're both queer, while my sister is unlabelled and not attracted to F.

Me and F are closeted so only get to be affectionate around each other and M which is frustrating. M is really close to F which I'm totally fine with, that's awesome but every time we're walking around a shopping centre and I hold F's hand... M has to hold his hand too. I get they're really close but it's kind of getting to the point where it's uncomfortable as we can't hold each other's hands as a couple. 

I've tried to light heartedly tell M to back off a little but she kicks up a stink and calls me ""controlling and weird"". I've talked to F about this and he also agrees I gets annoying but doesn't say anything as M is quite dramatic and entitled, often causing issues if she doesn't get her way. She also refuses to take a couple of cute photos of me and F (very occasionally) and goes as far as to call us annoying. We're not overly affectionate as we usually meet in public but we'll kiss or hold each other's hands if we're in private. 

Before you say M is feeling left out, that's not the case. We're all incredibly close and it gets to the point where M and F often talk to each other more than me, leaving me out. We had a toxic friend before who was very controlling of F so idk if that's the case. 

I'm just a bit unsure of what to do because i don't want to be mean to my sister or make her upset or left out, but I want to be able to hold my own boyfriend's hand without another person having to hold his aswell and he feels the same vice versa.

14,1dx3htf,AITA for refusing to take part in family drama and act as a therapist?,"My mother, sister, and maternal grandparents are my only family, as my father and his side are not in the picture. I (18M) have minimal contact with my grandparents, speaking to them infrequently until recently with them now speaking to me semi-frequently (a conversation every few months). My sister and mother have, however, had regular contact with them for their entire lives - though over the past few months they have been arguing almost daily. The arguments come out of nowhere over the most insignificant things.

  
Despite explaining that I don't agree with my grandparents' viewpoints, my mother confronted me about my lack of anger towards them. She accused me of not caring about her and my sister and refusing to participate in their punishments, such as ignoring my grandparents. I said that now that I'm finally being treated as though I'm part of the family (even if only a bit) I don't want to risk damaging my relationship with them permanently over anything. I continued to explain that the way they both always come to me expecting constant sympathy and my agreement that they're in the right was uncomfortable for me as I always feel pressured to sit for hours and take sides in an argument I wasn't part of.

  
My mother and sister are now refusing to talk to me, saying that they 'wouldn't want to bother me with anything'. My mother (who has chronic depression, social anxiety, and a few other mental health 'issues') and sister (who also has social anxiety) have both said that I'm their only real outlet for any feelings they have, as they have no other family or friends that they can talk to due to their mental health issues. I said that I don't want to be their outlets as they only ever expected a one-sided conversations and never once wanted to know how I was doing, despite (unbeknownst to them) my own mental health problems - which they dismissed because I don't have a diagnosis and they do. 



When I explained that I've been struggling, including that I don't think I've experienced real happiness, as I have always been left out of family affairs, never had a real conversation or relationship with either my mother or sister, and have always been perfect so that they come to me with their problems and focus on themselves, they said that I'm being unreasonable and that I'm not seeing their side of the situation, where I've always been protected from my family, and that as I'm very introverted there's no real problems that I can have anyway as I should be happy staying in my room 24/7 doing my own thing and always achieving high grades in school. When I explained that I don't even think I'll be comfortable trying to find boyfriends and start relationships, or start any families in the future because I wouldn't know how to interact positively and thought I was only worth tolerating for free therapy and dispute resolution, they said that I don't need to worry because I'm an unloveable, uncaring asshole.
