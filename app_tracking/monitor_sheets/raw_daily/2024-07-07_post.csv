0,1dxcsql,AITA for leaving to go to a family event even though it's never been a problem before?,"Okay so for a bit of context, I 16f usually help my mom with pet sitting. She does it as an extra job, and sometimes takes on more than one at a time. Everyone she pet sits for is aware that I might fill in for her, and they are completely fine with that. If they aren't. She is the only person who goes over. 

There is a man that she pet sits for who lives only about a 2-minute walk from our house, and he is totally fine with me, my brother 18m, and my brothers boyfriend 18m, pet sitting for him.

The last two times I was over there it was me and my brother's partner who we will call Michael. Sometimes depending on our schedules, I will go over with Michael and be there for about 2 hours, and then he will have to leave for something, but I will still be there. That has never been a problem. 

Today, Michael and I went over there at about 11:15 a.m., and I had to leave for a family barbecue at 1:00 p.m.. he and I were watching a movie when my dad got there to pick me up, so I left. 

My brother who we will call Damien came over only a few minutes after I left. So the dogs were never alone, Michael was there the entire time. 

The man who we will call Steven was supposed to be home around 3:30. He suddenly barged in at 2:30, and began yelling at both my brother and his boyfriend. Saying that he was tired of the revolving door of all of us, sometimes being there sometimes not. 

My brother and Michael tried to explain that the dogs were never alone, Michael had been there the entire time, and just because I left didn't mean anything. 

Steven then said that next time he wants it to just be me there. Just me the whole time. No one else. That made me really uncomfortable when Michael told me that. Bc I'm a 16-year-old, and he's definitely anywhere from late '40s early '50s. 

Both me and my mother have a little bit of an inkling that Steven was more so mad because Michael is a trans man. Steven has never said anything bad, but he does have conservative newspapers around his house and stuff like that. 

Also, when he came in and began yelling at Michael and Damien, he brought up the fact that he had never met Michael before. They had met more than five times at this point.. And even had a 10-minute conversation before so I don't know what he was on. 

He was mostly just pissed that I wasn't there anymore, and that Michael apparently had never introduced himself, even though I was with him when he did the first time they ever met.

I'm wondering if maybe I was the asshole for leaving when he didn't know I was going to, but I can't see how that's a possibility when the dogs were never alone, and he has established that he is okay with my brother and his partner watching his dogs.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-07-07,"AITA for leaving to go to a family event even though it's never been a problem before?

1,1dx71oy,UPDATE - AITA for refusing to replace a picture I posted with an edited version of it?,"I decided to follow your advice. A few days after I first posted here, I removed the picture. My post on Instagram now looks exactly the same as it did before my father made me include his girlfriend.

I did so because she was still asking me to switch the pictures. She had begged, sent me an alternate version in which she ""only edited herself"" (lie, everyone's teeth were still whitened) and tried to guilt trip me about it. I consider myself to be a very patient woman, but I do have limits.

That's when I removed the picture. I think she was checking my post, because she texted me about an hour later asking why I'd changed it. I reminded her I'd promised to remove the picture if she didn't accept the unedited one.

My father later tried to convince me to repost it, but I told him I'm not doing that again. When he protested, I told him to stop and think about the fact that he was complaining about a social media post on a private account. I think he did, because he apologized for the drama and stopped bringing it up.

I did get a few more texts from his girlfriend asking me to reconsider, to which I replied that since she doesn't want any real depictions of her online, I will never include her on my social media again. I think she's still upset, but she's no longer bothering me about it.

Also, I took the opportunity to remind all parties that only me and my husband are allowed to post pictures of our child online. Just in case.

2,1dx5mgs,AITA for confronting my now ex-friend after they kept trying to out me and even outed me a few times?,"(Throwaway acc)

I (17M) am transgender. I was born female and now identify as male. When I was fifteen I met my now ex-friend (17NB). I and this friend grew close rather quickly. We texted and hung out a lot and I grew comfortable around them. When we were sixteen I came out to them as being transgender and told them my chosen name.

They were excited and the first thing they started talking about was to tell everyone. Friends, teachers, random people I would introduce myself to, even my mother who I had made clear to them doesn't accept people who are transgender. I was quick to reject these Ideas as wasn't ready.

This didn't stop them. Through the next month, they'd nag me and constantly tell me to ""just do it."" I kept telling them no. But they refused to stop and it got to the point where they threatened to tell our friends themself if I wouldn't. I caved in and I came out to our friends over text. this behaviour continued and they ended up telling our social teacher. They had been nagging me about telling her and they kept ""offering"" to tell her for me and I said yes.

It had taken me five months before fully confronting them, they had been gone for a trip and I texted them. Not about this but another problem with them using my iPad and downloading certain types of inappropriate fanfics. I started with small problems and I planned to talk about the big issue when they got back in person but I didn't get that opportunity. I had a friend who had problems with them and she started texting them about everything.

It was later that night when I got a long text from them, angry at me for talking to our friend about my issues with them and telling that friend about rude things they had said about her. I got angry and I texted them about every single problem, including this one. They apologised and they said things like ""I never plan to come out."" ""Coming out over text doesn't seem like a big deal for me."" ""These issues were months ago."" ""This isn't fair to me."" This pissed me off and I got really angry and I swore, and yelled, and said that it wasn't a good response and wouldn't be friends with them anymore. I know the way I went about it was rude, I had said things like ""How dare you."" ""Good for you, you got good experiences! I didn’t"" ""You were lucky for getting support, I wasn't"" And I shouldn't have said these things because they don't have full support and I essentially dismissed their struggles with my words.

They pulled away from any mutual friends we had and they claim it's my fault for making them lose other people even though I only discussed these issues with one mutual friend and a friend who was my own. I have heard them call me and our mutual friend's assholes amongst other things and they completely blame me.

3,1dx4m6g,AITA for telling my brother he's the worst person ever to exist?,"I am the only child between my parents. My mother has 2 sons from a previous marriage and my dad has 1 son from his previous marriage. The brother that I'm talking about is from my moms first marriage, call him Jack. My dad raised Jack, all of us kids equally, always took care of us. My dads family was the only family who Jack knew, they never treated him differently, never. Everyone was always together, celebrated holidays, birthdays etc...Fast forward twenty years, my parents announce that they are going to get divorced. Which is fine, wasn't a secret. We were all grown up and out of the house at this point anyways.

Which Jack decides to announce that as our parents are getting divorced, he's no longer part of the family. He's divorcing everyone too! The whole family who took care of him,he just decided they weren't his family. Just like that, poof. Cut everyone who ever cared about him off, except for our mom. Which the communication between them was poor at best. 

I had still tried to reach out to him and his family. He ignored me, until one day he asked me to meet him for lunch one day, where he looked me dead in the face and point blank told me that we had NOTHING in common and he would like it if we were strangers on the street.

Two years later, my grandmother dies. Everyone tried to get ahold of him for him to at least come and pay respects to the only grandmother he has ever known. Crickets. Another two years goes by and no-one has heard a peep out from him and my uncle falls ill and passes away and this is where things get tricky.

Uncle is in hospice, very ill and Jack magically shows up! Coming to visit Uncle, talking to family members, like everything is fine. I didn't know of this until my cousin told me sending me a screen shot of a text he had sent her. Which in return I took his phone number, texted him and told him to leave her alone and how Uncle didn't like him and how he divorced the family, he stepped out, he had no rights. He texted me back, begging to meet and explain. I agreed.

I wanted him to say something, anything.I asked him what we were doing there, what he did he have to say? He said nothing,I tried to understand. Instead he let me sit at the bar and fully cuss him out and tell him how hurtful his actions were on the family. Not showing up to grandmothers funeral but visiting uncle in hospice? (Uncle hated him, btw) After YEARS of silence. He said NOTHING. So I sat and told him exactly what everyone thought of him. Not sure what he was expecting, after begging to explain his actions to me and stayed silent the whole time. I told him how much I hated him and how he was the worst.

Next morning, I get a long text message from my dad about how upset my mom is with me, how I had the nerve to say what I said to Jack. Jack called my mom the next morning and had told her and complained about what I said.

Anyways, my dad has anger issues. He always had them for as long as I could remember. I go out of my way to spend as little time around him as possible. despite this, I get yelled at 3-7 times a day. So I spend all my time in my bedroom to keep that on the low end.

Lately he has been getting mad that I had been spending my time upstairs in my bedroom, locked away not socializing. I told him that my brother (19M) is sleeping or playing Roblox upstairs and Mom only speaks Spanish (I don't) and is also upstairs 24/7.

He then changes to how he never really talks to me any more and that if I keep playing video games or whatever then I will regret not spending more time with him and to stop being selfish. I then tell him that he never wants to hang out anyways and that he is also in his bedroom all the time.

(Not important but he tells me to not say ""hang out"" but ""spend time together"" because that is proper way to say that.)

Anyways he then lays into me for not responding to him shouting up the stairs. I tried to tell him the my window opens up to the highway so I can barely hear him and with the fan on, it's worse. (Hot summer days are hot. It's July Man.)

He then tells me that from now on starting tomorrow, I must be downstairs on the couch, from 9AM to 6PM and doing something that is not reading, on my phone or video games.

When I told him that this is not fair and what should I even do, he tells me that I should have not had my window open or the fan on and that it would not be an issue if I stayed downstairs and that I could play board games.

I told my only friend on discord and she told me that I was an A-Hole and that I would not be yelled at unless I was doing something wrong and that I should just suck it up. I told my brother and he just told me it sucks to suck.

Lately he has been getting mad that I had been spending my time upstairs in my bedroom, locked away not socializing. I told him that my brother (19M) is sleeping or playing Roblox upstairs and Mom only speaks Spanish (I don't) and is also upstairs 24/7.

He then changes to how he never really talks to me any more and that if I keep playing video games or whatever then I will regret not spending more time with him and to stop being selfish. I then tell him that he never wants to hang out anyways and that he is also in his bedroom all the time.

(Not important but he tells me to not say ""hang out"" but ""spend time together"" because that is proper way to say that.)

Anyways he then lays into me for not responding to him shouting up the stairs. I tried to tell him the my window opens up to the highway so I can barely hear him and with the fan on, it's worse. (Hot summer days are hot. It's July Man.)

He then tells me that from now on starting tomorrow, I must be downstairs on the couch, from 9AM to 6PM and doing something that is not reading, on my phone or video games.

When I told him that this is not fair and what should I even do, he tells me that I should have not had my window open or the fan on and that it would not be an issue if I stayed downstairs and that I could play board games.

I told my only friend on discord and she told me that I was an A-Hole and that I would not be yelled at unless I was doing something wrong and that I should just suck it up. I told my brother and he just told me it sucks to suck.

AITA for wanting to stay in my room for as long as possible or is he the A-Hole for for demanding me to be downstairs for socialization when there is no one to talk to?",0.0,-0.0008288168,0,1

My parents, especially my mom, have been really pissed at me for sleeping in and waking up at 10 am or 12 noon because ""a normal human being doesn't wake up at that time"" and my mom has been screaming at me fot gaming at night because I should be studying for some stupid government exam they want me to take next month (which i don't even want to take in the first place cause i already passed the first level of that exam and barely even studied for it so why bother studying for this other one yk when it legit just has the same coverage but is just slightly longer) and to start studying for my board exam next year. My parents are also your typical strict Asian parents fyi. I'm also graduating with a bachelor's degree in Psychology and they want me to get an office job in HR or something and to work for the government because there's apparently more money there but I really don't want to because I hate being confined in a tiny space and doing the same shit every single day in a boring office and I sure as hell don't want to work for for the government. Financially, I'd say we're comfortable too, since my mom's a doctor and my dad's an engineer and has a business on the side, and I'm literally an only child, so it's confusing why they're rushing me so much to get a job already. I just wanted at least two months to take a break from studying because all I did was study non-stop in my 4 years of university, since we never had a single summer vacation because of the pandemic and had to rush through classes so we could ""graduate on time"". I just wanted to take a little breather before finding a job but apparently me wanting to sleep in and playing video games during my spare time makes me a ""childish and irresponsible brat"" (my mom's actual words) so does this really make me the asshole?

EDIT: I'd like to clarify. I live in Asia, and my parents are really strict to the point that they berate me and shit even for the simplest things like having the dogs inside the house or adding too much spice in the food I cook. My mom's also the type of person to tell me that, ""you're useless"" or ""nobody will love you but us"" and my dad even physically hurts me to the point that I've been covered in bruises and had to leave home. My mom also legit throws temper tantrums and throws glasses or plates when things don't go her way, so yeah, my home life isn't the best. I've begged them to get therapy but they say that it's normal to fight in families and that my family is completely normal.

I actually have been working on my resume, other important documents, and have been looking for jobs and am trying to apply. I haven't been sitting around just doing nothing because I really do plan to move out. My mental health has been in shambles and I don't have the best support system so I sleep so I can feel peaceful in this house and I play when I can because that makes me happy and even how little this sounds, it helps keep me alive. Even playing with my dogs gets my mom riled up because I love the dogs more than her (well yeah no shit, i got diagnosed with ptsd, depression, and anxiety because of her years of abuse)

9,1dx3vlx,AITA (21f ) for not taking care of my brothers (26m) cat while he is out of town?,"Hello everyone! I’m sorry if this is long it kind of has a lot of context but here we go. Also all fake names! 

For some background, a few years ago when I started sleeping over with my bf my brother Will (26m) vehemently told me he would not feed my cat when I slept away from the house. So I spent hundreds finding a feeder for my cat because she only eats wet food due to her age. 

Fast forward to 2 years later. My brother now has a gf and often goes to stay at her house for the weekend and will often not inform or ask me or my mom to care for his cat. I have brought this up multiple times that it is his responsibility and he needs to at least ASK. It’s gone like this for a few months of me refusing and my mom picking up his slack. 

This weekend, apparently Will went with his gf about 5 hours away for a job. My mom is also out of town this week. I’m already taking care of most of my mom’s responsibilities while she is away and my brother did not tell me when he was leaving or anything. Today I get a text at 11am of my brother asking for me to feed his cat. I am in the service industry but have a set schedule and I work every weekend. When Will messaged I was already at work so I said that; as well as a message saying it was disrespectful to assume me or my mom will do it for him. He just brushed me off. 

I get home at about 6:30 today, do a few things, then feel bad because I really don’t know when the last time Will’s cat ate. So I go in the room and feed him a can. As I am doing that Will arrives home and makes a comment about me just feeding the cat “as he shows up” 
This makes me frustrated and I kind of go off (not yelling but definitely mad). I tell Will again that it is rude to not ask someone until it’s too late and that his cat is his responsibility. Will says “I checked your location and it said you were at home when I texted you” I was not at home I was at work since about 10:30 this morning. Will then accuses me of lying saying that I probably waited until I did get to work to answer him. 

I have screenshots of the time stamps is anyone would like to see. And luckily I am moving out in a few months. So am I the asshole for not taking care of my brothers cat while he is out of town?

10,1dx3v14,AITA for leaving my kids with my mother instead of my ex MIL?,"I (26F) recently split from my ex husband. Our relationship wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t a love marriage. I was disowned at 18 for drug use and ended up pregnant by a much older man. He insisted I marry him and I did so I wasn’t homeless. Not the best foundation for a marriage.

I spent the next 7ish years having three kids, and being a mother to his two daughters from his first marriage. I had no time for myself.

Now that we’re split up, I leave my kids with my mother sometimes so I can do things for myself. My mother insisted that I picked up a hobby so I’ve been learning to swim and I’ve been taking classes at a community college. I also take a ‘personal’ day sometimes just to get my hair done or read a book. I was hesitant to be away from my kids so often at first but my mother says I need it and I’ve been feeling better about myself. 

A massive issue that arose when I left my husband was how often his mother would be able to see our kids. She used to come over to the home I shared with my ex almost daily to see our kids but now I live with my mother. I told her that I would always try my best to make sure she sees them often but I haven’t been if i’m being honest, which is why I’m the asshole. I’ve been so caught up in my nee hobbies and studies that I’ve been leaving my kids with my mom all the time instead of calling her up to see if she can watch them.

She saw me out three days ago and asked where the kids were. I told her they were with my mother and we got into a massive argument because she hasn’t seen them in the past six weeks. She called me a massive asshole for going back on my promise.

I feel terrible but Im also just kind of confused. My mother barely saw my kids until recently but she saw them everyday. I know it’s not an excuse since I made a promise but I’m at a loss. She is extremely upset with me and my ex called me and basically yelled at me for lying to his mother. AITA?",Not enough info,2024-07-07,"AITA for leaving my kids with my mother instead of my ex MIL?

11,1dx3qj9,AITA for cutting off my son?,"For starters I have not taken any steps as of yet, but can’t decide if I should. 

My son 18M and I 36M are currently not speaking. His mother 40F and I have been together 10 years and married for 2 1/2 months. 

We have our fair share of disagreements, and recently had a rough one the other night. We shouted back and forth for a bit about the amount of time each other spends on their phones, not spending enough time with each other, and so on.

This all culminated with her telling me she’d smash my phone and being the typical arrogant jerk I am I tossed it to her and dared her. She threw my phone on the floor and attempted to smash it to no avail.

My other son 16M had his sisters (12F and 9F) in his room at the far end of the house due to the argument, and I decided it would be best to just get away from the whole thing. I took my girls and went to the store to just separate from my wife and let us both cool down.

Shortly after I got to Walmart my son called me screaming at me about hurting his mother. He was screaming that I had hit her and threatened her and she called him to come pick her up and take her to her mom’s. I tried to explain that he was wrong for about 20 seconds, but he got increasingly loud and disrespectful so I just told him that he was my son and wouldn’t talk to me like that. I asked him to call me back when he has a cooler head.

TO BE CLEAR I DID NOT PUT HANDS ON MY WIFE. She told my son I threw my phone at her which she later admitted was a lie.

Well since then he hasn’t been home (he lives with us) and has not answered a single call or text. This in and of itself is very disrespectful in my eyes, but there are several obligations going on that require our communication. Such as his new car and insurance (In my name), selling his old car, etc.

I have given it about a week and call it what you will, but I’m pretty much done with waiting. I sent him a message saying that any issue he has we can talk about or work out, but he needs to at least reach out to me.

He has his own job and makes his own money. He has never nor will I ask him ever to pay any sort of home bills. He lives/lived completely off my dime up until he stopped coming home. This is with the exception of an iPhone that he recently financed after losing the 13 I provided him with

I was raised kind of old school and my way of thinking is, if you want to be a man and completely write me off you can go pay your own way. 

Here is what I am wrestling with doing:

Take his car
Suspend his phone service
Remove him from the family Apple 
Take him off of my Credit Card

I have no intentions of kicking him out or otherwise making my home unavailable to him, but if you’re too grown to talk to Dad, you are also too grown for his money.

13,1dx3ko1,WIBTA if i told my sister to stop being so clingy with my bf?,"Ok guys so me (nb17) and my bf F (m15) have been together for about 2 months now but have been best friends for about a year and a bit. My sister, M (f14), has also been friends with him for the same amount of time. F is a trans man and I am non binary and we're both queer, while my sister is unlabelled and not attracted to F.

Me and F are closeted so only get to be affectionate around each other and M which is frustrating. M is really close to F which I'm totally fine with, that's awesome but every time we're walking around a shopping centre and I hold F's hand... M has to hold his hand too. I get they're really close but it's kind of getting to the point where it's uncomfortable as we can't hold each other's hands as a couple. 

I've tried to light heartedly tell M to back off a little but she kicks up a stink and calls me ""controlling and weird"". I've talked to F about this and he also agrees I gets annoying but doesn't say anything as M is quite dramatic and entitled, often causing issues if she doesn't get her way. She also refuses to take a couple of cute photos of me and F (very occasionally) and goes as far as to call us annoying. We're not overly affectionate as we usually meet in public but we'll kiss or hold each other's hands if we're in private. 

Before you say M is feeling left out, that's not the case. We're all incredibly close and it gets to the point where M and F often talk to each other more than me, leaving me out. We had a toxic friend before who was very controlling of F so idk if that's the case. 

I'm just a bit unsure of what to do because i don't want to be mean to my sister or make her upset or left out, but I want to be able to hold my own boyfriend's hand without another person having to hold his aswell and he feels the same vice versa.

The person that invited me, Tim (27m) wanted to invite me to a trip next week to the hotel where my other friend, Ron (29m) worked. I have introduced these two a while back, when we had a vacation with other friends in the hotel he worked at. Ron is a very generous host and gave us a discount for the room, catered to us and even provided many luxuries from the hotel that would otherwise have costed us money. His reason? I was a friend of his for a while so he wanted to do so. Even if I tried to pay him back in other ways (giving food that I cooked or taking him to hang out).

Back to Tim. He said that he was planning to do another trip, this time with his family and he wanted me to come next week. I asked him why was I invited. And he told me that it’s because Ron worked there. This made me suspicious so I asked what I had to do with it. He wanted me to ask for the same acommodations that Ron provided us last time. I hung up on him, after I told him no that I can’t. I cooled down after a few hours and may have realized that I was being a dick.

20,1dxu4ln,AITAH for missing my best friend after 3 years of ghosting her and befriending her enemy?,"Long post but I need help…

It’s been almost three years since I (26F) have seen or talked to my ex best friend (26F) and now that I am about to get married, I’m wondering if I should reach out. 

For context, me and my ex-best (we’ll call Hannah) friend met in the summer of 2016 when some mutual friends of ours went bowling. After that initial meeting, it was like an instant connection between us. For the following 6 years, we were nearly inseparable. Hannah and I hung out almost every week, even while going to separate colleges in the area. We went through boyfriends and breakups, school, and family stress together. Flash forward to 2020, after graduating from our separate college, Hannah and I decided to move into a house together. We only lived together for a year, and I know what people say about not living with your best friends, but honestly, it was fine. We hung out even more, went on trips, had friends over. We had a few friendship spats but nothing serious and we were always able to work it out. The following summer she decided to move out to find a place closer to work and that was fine too because my sister planned on moving in. That summer however, things began to go downhill with us. I met this guy from work who I began seeing and my friend (and our other mutual friends didn’t approve of). There was nothing wrong with this guy, except for the fact that he didn’t have the same moral values as me and my friends deemed us too incompatible. At the time, I was blinded by love and chose him over my friend’s advice and because of this, instead of trying to talk to her, I just isolated myself further with this guy. Was not the best decision but like I said, he wasn’t abusive anything, if fact he was incredibly loving, attentive and supportive, we just did not have the same moral values. I have a tendency toward isolation, so at first became shorter with our friend group in text and cancel on them a few times and after a few weeks that was it. Now, I know it is my fault for isolating myself but I do want to make note that it didn’t take very long for my “closest friends” to give up trying to seem me. I started distancing myself in September of that year and by early October, they were not reaching at all. As many of you who isolate know, I was extremely lonely, even while in this relationship. I wanted to reach back out to my friends and apologize to them, but i was a mixture of hurt and guilt for what I had done.

In the beginning of 2023 I had turned over a new leaf with myself and started trying to make new friends for myself. This lead me to a friend we’ll call Jenny. Jenny. Jenny is Hannah’s ex boyfriend’s new girlfriend. I know. This breaks all kinds of girl code. However, just for added info: Hannah and her former ex dated for about 6 months back when they were still in high school. Also our community is not very big, so friendship circles intersect all the time. In February and mutual friend of me and Jenny invited us to the movies one night and I was trying to hard to make new friends and was so tired of being lonely, I went.

A picture of me out with her was posted on her BeReal (which Hannah doesn’t follow) and the next day I was blocked by Hannah on everything. When I mean everything I mean EVERYTHING. All social media, all of our shared streaming accounts, FindMyFriends. The girl blocked me from seeing her activity notifications on Apple Fitness. She also blocked my sister on everything as well. No word, just silent ghosting after 4 months of not really speaking. Also, in my isolation, I was on a hiatus from posting on my social media so it’s not like she was constantly seeing my stuff, she was just done

Jenny and I didn’t really hit it off. We never really became more than acquaintances who see each other at group functions. However being blocked HURT. But even more than that I was a little bit confused. Everything that had lead up to this point as friends, even the disagreement and isolation, it wasn’t tension between, just silence. Even if we couldn’t be as close of friends as we were before, i thought we could at least be friendly? I used to do EVERYTHING with this girl. We were literally closer than sisters. I thought we would be each other’s maid of honor, have our children be friends together, go on family vacations when we’re in our 40s together. In hindsight understand that going to the movies with your friends ex bf new gf most likely was the catalyst to this but I would think if it was that big of a deal, she would confronted me about it instead just completely cutting me off. That’s what I would I would have done. I believe you have the right to cut people off if they want to. However, cutting someone off without giving them the opportunity to change or apologize lacks emotional maturity. If she had told me “hey I know we haven’t talked in a while but I don’t like that you were out with my ex boyfriend’s girlfriend” I definitely would have apologized and honestly would have not hung out with the girl again. But is that the really reason she blocked me?

Me and the guy ended up breaking up for about 8 months and going no contact because we needed to work on ourselves separately and then we go back together. He is the love of my life and is so thoughtful, kind, and caring. I cannot imagine not being with him. We’ve been back together for almost another year and we’ve talk about getting engaged/married and I think he has a ring.

The rest is pretty much history. I never got a clear understanding of what her rationale was. I ended up going to therapy for a while (honestly because of this situation and also to help me find healthy ways of doing things instead of isolation). Since then, I have only seen Hannah twice, once at a graduation party and another time a grocery store. Both times she came up to say hi to me and literally acted like nothing was wrong. Both times I was so confused and shocked and hurt but still said hi back. I texted her once last fall and apologized for being distant last year and asked how she was doing. She just replied with a short “I’m good! :)” I still follow Hannah’s mom on social’s and she sends me TikTok’s and Instagram post daily. I considered asking her about Hannah and seeing if it was a good idea or not to reach out to her but I chicken out every time, mostly bc I don’t wanna involve her in any drama. I thought about reaching out again especially in lue if maybe getting engaged and seeing if we could talk with even the slightest hope that we could clear the air or start over but now it’s been so long that I don’t even know what to say. On top of that, I’m not even sure if we could ever be friends again; the trust we had is now gone. I thought about doing it for closure, but I’m not sure if that would do any good for either of us at this point.

Long story short: I miss her. I miss the friendship we had. I don’t think about her now as much as I once did, but (obviously) I still do. I have made some wonderful friends now that love, and support me and are excited for what’s to come and I love them endlessly, but there’s still a tiny “Hannah”-Sized hole in my heart.

AITAH for missing my best friend after 3 years of ghosting her and befriend her enemy? And should I reach out to her to apologize/for closure or heal and let go?",TL;DR,2024-07-07,"AITAH for missing my best friend after 3 years of ghosting her and befriending her enemy? Long post but I need help…

It’s been almost three years since I (26F) have seen or talked to my ex best friend (26F) and now that I am about to get married, I’m wondering if I should reach out. 

For context, me and my ex-best (we’ll call Hannah) friend met in the summer of 2016 when some mutual friends of ours went bowling. After that initial meeting, it was like an instant connection between us. For the following 6 years, we were nearly inseparable. Hannah and I hung out almost every week, even while going to separate colleges in the area. We went through boyfriends and breakups, school, and family stress together. Flash forward to 2020, after graduating from our separate college, Hannah and I decided to move into a house together. We only lived together for a year, and I know what people say about not living with your best friends, but honestly, it was fine. We hung out even more, went on trips, had friends over. We had a few friendship spats but nothing serious and we were always able to work it out. The following summer she decided to move out to find a place closer to work and that was fine too because my sister planned on moving in. That summer however, things began to go downhill with us. I met this guy from work who I began seeing and my friend (and our other mutual friends didn’t approve of). There was nothing wrong with this guy, except for the fact that he didn’t have the same moral values as me and my friends deemed us too incompatible. At the time, I was blinded by love and chose him over my friend’s advice and because of this, instead of trying to talk to her, I just isolated myself further with this guy. Was not the best decision but like I said, he wasn’t abusive anything, if fact he was incredibly loving, attentive and supportive, we just did not have the same moral values. I have a tendency toward isolation, so at first became shorter with our friend group in text and cancel on them a few times and after a few weeks that was it. Now, I know it is my fault for isolating myself but I do want to make note that it didn’t take very long for my “closest friends” to give up trying to seem me. I started distancing myself in September of that year and by early October, they were not reaching at all. As many of you who isolate know, I was extremely lonely, even while in this relationship. I wanted to reach back out to my friends and apologize to them, but i was a mixture of hurt and guilt for what I had done.

In the beginning of 2023 I had turned over a new leaf with myself and started trying to make new friends for myself. This lead me to a friend we’ll call Jenny. Jenny. Jenny is Hannah’s ex boyfriend’s new girlfriend. I know. This breaks all kinds of girl code. However, just for added info: Hannah and her former ex dated for about 6 months back when they were still in high school. Also our community is not very big, so friendship circles intersect all the time. In February and mutual friend of me and Jenny invited us to the movies one night and I was trying to hard to make new friends and was so tired of being lonely, I went.

A picture of me out with her was posted on her BeReal (which Hannah doesn’t follow) and the next day I was blocked by Hannah on everything. When I mean everything I mean EVERYTHING. All social media, all of our shared streaming accounts, FindMyFriends. The girl blocked me from seeing her activity notifications on Apple Fitness. She also blocked my sister on everything as well. No word, just silent ghosting after 4 months of not really speaking. Also, in my isolation, I was on a hiatus from posting on my social media so it’s not like she was constantly seeing my stuff, she was just done

Jenny and I didn’t really hit it off. We never really became more than acquaintances who see each other at group functions. However being blocked HURT. But even more than that I was a little bit confused. Everything that had lead up to this point as friends, even the disagreement and isolation, it wasn’t tension between, just silence. Even if we couldn’t be as close of friends as we were before, i thought we could at least be friendly? I used to do EVERYTHING with this girl. We were literally closer than sisters. I thought we would be each other’s maid of honor, have our children be friends together, go on family vacations when we’re in our 40s together. In hindsight understand that going to the movies with your friends ex bf new gf most likely was the catalyst to this but I would think if it was that big of a deal, she would confronted me about it instead just completely cutting me off. That’s what I would I would have done. I believe you have the right to cut people off if they want to. However, cutting someone off without giving them the opportunity to change or apologize lacks emotional maturity. If she had told me “hey I know we haven’t talked in a while but I don’t like that you were out with my ex boyfriend’s girlfriend” I definitely would have apologized and honestly would have not hung out with the girl again. But is that the really reason she blocked me?

He is the love of my life and is so thoughtful, kind, and caring. I cannot imagine not being with him.

23,1dxtzqb,AITA (20M) For getting mad at my parent after finding out she was a sex worker?,"So I was born in the early 2000s  and I was raised in Los Angeles. Both my parents were 1st generation and were raised here in the states but neither my mom or my dads English is very good so i'm assuming they didn't put any serious effort in school. My mother was in her early 20s and my father was in his mid-late 20s when I was born. My father is a very religious person and he started working from a really young age, and I always admired him, but later in life It became clear to me he isn't such a saint and that he made a lot of dumb selfish decisions early on which led to my mom and him separating and him going down a irresponsible path financially and him manipulating older desperate single women (usually with kids) to be with him, he really just wanted someone to wash and fold his clothes, cook him food, and use their house to keep his car in a convenient place instead of worrying about parking it on the street, + to keep a roof over his head. He lied to me about a lot of things, including how much money he would give my mom for child support, and things that my mom did. My mom always presses me and asks me why Im so nice and dismissive about things my father does and that im not hard enough on him or criticize him enough. 

Before I was born, my mother was a stripper, and before that she was known as a ""promiscuous girl"" in School according to my dad (he recently told me). However she stopped when she got with my dad. See my dad was a workaholic and he didn't know what to do with his money, and  so he smooth talked her into starting a family with him, promising her stuff like a house, and an allowance so she could buy stuff she likes when he's working in other cities and stuff. He convinced her that starting a family is beautiful and that she would be happy. Pretty much everything he told her was a false promise other than the last part. As far as I know, my mother adored me and my brother. She was very happy with us, especially when we were smaller. She always told me we were the best thing to happen to her. And yk, I was always happy with her too, I told her she was the best mom in the world, and I would really only get upset with her for typical things, like not letting me hang out with my friends, or her turning off my tv/videogames. This was when I was a small kid.

When my mom and dad separated, she got a job as a prep cook downtown. We got by in Los Angeles with this job, rent was around $600-800 at the time, and I remember every weekend or month or so  my dad would give her money, (definitely not enough though for what he was making) and everything felt fine, + she would rent the other room out to a family member or a friend usually. Me my mom and my brother slept in one room for the longest time. I never saw my mom struggle with credit cards or the rent or groceries. And me my mom and my brother would often go out to restaurants, and she'd always be going to ross to buy clothes, and she even got a newer car back in 2013 or so which she financed and never made a late payment on. We would even sometimes use her credit card without her knowledge to buy video games or microtransactions on the App Store which we would get punished for.

 But around 2016-2018, I don't know exactly when, my mother started to escort. She was seeing this man who lived in Bakersfield and had a bunch of semi trucks. I found out because she was talking to this guy cause I would use her phone to play certain games and I would snoop around and go on her Facebook. My mother is now married to this old white guy who's about to be 60, and she honestly only married him because he has a lot of money from when his parents died, and because she wanted to stop paying for rent, bills, and utilities. He proposed to her sometime in the mid 2010s, but she refused, but they were dating the whole time. So even back then I knew she was cheating on him with that semi truck guy.  He's the definition of ""nice guys finish last"", because my mom really doesn't love him or show any kind of affection, she just does ""wife things"" like cleaning house, and cooking for him. 

But anyways, my father recently told me that she was giving this guy a lot of money, and he knew this because my dad would pick me and my brother up on Friday or Saturday, and drop us back off on Sunday or Monday, and during the summer we would switch up stay with him a few weeks, or months, and we would be with out mom on the weekends. He told me that when he went to drop us off  with our mom and he had some child support money, my mom wouldn't even be home, and that he would make us wait in the truck on the other side of the apartment and he would go to the backside where the parking spots are and wait for her there on another street. He told me my mom would show up in this guys car, which was usually a nicer car, and that she would brag to him about how they're making a lot of money together, etc. Back in 2022 when I heard this I was like ""yeah, I always knew she was cheating on so and so with that guy"", and my dad pulled out  his phone and showed me some screenshots of my Mom on BACKPAGE and some other sites where she was advertising herself. My dad had told me he found these pictures around the time she was with this guy, and that before she was seeing him, she never did anything like that aside from the stripping.

 Around 2018, when I was in middle school still, my mom had moved out to the valley with this white guy who she's married to now, and I absolutely did not want to move there but my mom took me along anyways. But Im guessing that's when the escorting stopped because she  became really introverted once she moved in. She doesn't really go anywhere but work or to run errands ( she does gigs on Instawork now) I never told her now husband what she did in the past and I honestly don't care to. 

Right before we moved, my mom was in such a rush to move. I actually remember confronting my mom about her cheating on the white guy, because I think her iCloud was linked to the Mac in the living room and me n my bro found a picture of this guy touching his genitals. She denied that she knew anything and this was not too long before she decided to commit to living with the guy she was cheating on. 

The thing is, I know she wasn't doing this to make ends meet. Or put food on the table. She was living her best life with this guy because me nor my brother really saw an improvement to quality of life. We were still going to trashy public LAUSD schools and we had dirty shoes and pretty much all the things we liked at the time, (skateboards, xbox, gaming pc), our dad had given it to us because we would work with him during the summer breaks for school. And when we moved in to the valley in 2018, the only improvement in the quality of life came from the fact that were living in this guys apartment which has 2 rooms, one for them and one for me & my sibling, and air conditioning. Once they got married, my mom would start nagging him because this guy is frugal asf and doesn't want to buy a house in SoCal yet or upgrade any of the furniture in the apartment, like the carpet, fridge, and stove (which was working fine, everything was clean just not modern and expensive). Even though this stuff was an upgrade from where we previously lived. Im guessing my mom is to used to living with guys who have fancy shiny stuff and the simple boring lifestyle her husband has annoys her to no end.

  
Once I saw the pictures I got really angry at my mom it just felt so weird and disgusting to see my pictures and I had to distance my self, my brother also felt the same why and joined the U.S marines earlier this year, which he had tried to do ever since he heard about it. This came up in 2022 so I went to a trade school and lived in Long Beach, then I got out and starting living with a friend when we got into the same union.

My mother was really depressed in 2022 and 2023, and we had not spoke to her at all, except recently when I told her about my brother graduating and that we felt bad for not inviting her and that she could come to mines later this year. She was furious when she heard that my brother had already graduated and not gotten invited. She said me and my brother were dead to her and that nobody has ever made her feel so bad like we did in 2022-2023. She said good luck, and told us to not talk with her again for a while.

1. This one sounds insane but please stick with me here... Whenever me and my bestfriend are hanging out at her house or casually out together, we dress down very casual. I know she dresses up for dates because she would often come over before or afterwards and I'd see her cute date outfits. Oddly enough, now that my man is around (we just moved in together) she always comes over dressed up in what I would consider her date attire. Only when we go to my house, not when we go to hers or in public. I didn't notice at first, but after a while I realized shes always coming over wearing full face make-up, tons of perfume and her cutest outfits. Like shes going on a date...
2. I asked her to help my fiance get a management job at a local restaurant she worked in and she kindly did (this was months ago). She has since quit the job but goes in often for seemingly no reason. I know she's mentioned she's still in the groupchat where the scheduling is published, so it makes me wonder. Especially since she never mentions running into my fiance at his workplace, but he always mentions it to me and finds it funny that she comes in so much.
3. Lastly, I've noticed when she does come over to have drinks and dinner at my house that she talks to my fiance a lot. Like in a familiar sweet way idk. She'll yell stuff like ""I love you \[fiance's name\]"" when were hanging out and he does something like refills our drinks or puts on a movie. The frequency and familiarity of these comments kind of make me uncomfortable.

She didn't respond to my message for days and then just sent something about how she'll ""give me time,"" but didn't do a good job of denying my suspicions and she didn't affirm them by apologizing. I think she actually ended up going back into the restaurant a few times to say hey to my fiance while she was ""giving me time."" 

(tl;dr I'm afraid that my best friend of 4 years might be trying to get my fiance's attention by showing up at his workplace and being flirty when she visits our house. When I confronted her about it, she made me feel silly and dramatic, but continued her behavior.)",Not the A-hole,2024-07-07,"AITA for telling my BFF to back off of my fiance?

I invited one of my friends as well and we went, I had a blast and was jamming to the music. The whole time she was just sitting down with her boyfriend. Then on the way home with all of us in the car, she started poking fun at the fact that I was so excited and jumping around. I felt really hurt by this and told her later privately that I was not ok with that. Where she proceeded to brush it off like she wasn’t, I was staying at her place at the time in the same room as her. She has a queen size bed so there was a lot of room for me and her to both sleep. That night apparently while I was sleeping she snuck the boyfriend into her room, had sex with him on the same bed as I was sleeping and didn’t tell me until months later. She again and again puts him over me and puts me down trying to make him laugh. I’m heart broken over this friendship dying but I can’t take it any more. Reddit am I the asshole?

27,1dxt1ri,AITA for ignoring a coworker (60+ M) outside of work who I (24 F) feel uncomfortable around.,"I (24f, autistic) started a new job in an office 3 weeks ago and I have never worked in this kind of environment before. Everybody is very kind and friendly, and I’m enjoying the role. I work alone and I’m not part of any team, but there are many teams within the area so it’s a bit isolating. 

From day one, an older guy in the office has been very kind and friendly. If I’m honest, I thought he was gay due to his mannerisms and behaviour. On our second shift working together (this was around week 2 for me) he asked if I wanted to go for a coffee on our lunch break and talk. I said yes and we swapped instagrams. 

I noticed a close friend follows him and I asked her if she knew him. She does. She said he was very nice but a bit clingy. We went out and he made me the topic of conversation most of the time. I kept asking him questions to and he would say that he just wants to talk about me but I joked a few times that I would like it if we could bounce the conversation back and forth instead. I thought he was around 30-40 but it turns out he’s in his early 60s. 

He often complemented me in ways like saying I’m very mature for my age and that I am more interesting than I look. Both comments he said often and I laughed them off but I was pretty uncomfortable. At the end he said we should do this again and meet up outside of work which I said maybe to. 

When we got back to the office he gave me his number and I felt like I should give mine as I didn’t want to be rude. My friend messaged again saying how she was sorry but she felt she needed to say that this guy made her feel uncomfortable when she knew him as he would message her a lot and seemed overly friendly as he was in his 50s and she was 17 and the dynamic felt weird. She also said that she had thought he was gay and his behaviour suddenly felt off when she found out he was straight.  

He messaged me on insta a few times once I finished work and I felt worse so I restricted his account. It’s been a week and he has messaged often and yesterday he texted my phone. Nothing weird, just normal messages but I’ve met him 5 times in total now and it just seems very weird. The last few days he offers to do nice things for me often and has kind of pulled me on looking after myself as he didn’t think I had eaten that day (I had). 

He’s asked to go for coffee a few times since and I’ve said I’ve been busy with the onboarding but I do feel like I need to go for a coffee with him again this week as he paid last time despite me asking him not to and I said I would next time. 

I have had a lot of bad experiences with coworkers (male and female) and with older men and I don’t want to get into this kind of situation again. I don’t think it’s sexual but it does feel really off and I don’t know how to handle the situation or if I’m even right in doing so.

clarification;

M1 and M2 are customers that come to our establishment! 30F was the coworker. we also had another coworker there but i didnt feel like it was important to say. nontheless, the other coworker, who is a male, helped me remain calm after the M1 and M2 incidents.

______________________

I (22F) work at a certain establishment. My coworker (30F) works at the same establishment (obviously). We went out for drinks one night with a few guys from our work and it was kinda indirectly agreed on that she'd take part with... we'll say M1.. M2 is another guy that is important as well. so Me, my coworker and M1 and M2 all go out with a few other dudes. we leave our current bar, go down the street and we meet there. M1 and my coworker are not seen for a good 20 mins. we all assume sum goin on, yknow? great. So me and M2 are talking, we're all vibing. i go out and smoke and come back and at this point im crossfaded. my coworker and another guy go to the bathroom and theyre gone for a min.

All of a sudden.. M2 asks me ""Would you fuck me?"" M1 tips the table back, everyones kinda shocked and some people leave the table. M1 spills alcohol on him and he gets reasonably pissed (tho angry men is kinda a trigger for me so i get a little anxious). M2 makes it a point to explain we arent fucking and that it was a general question but i still didnt give him an answer... A certain song comes on after this, maybe within a 2-5 min span. M1 looks me in my eyes and goes ""do you have pxnties on?"" Im taken aback and i go ""yes?"" and he sits there, this song obviously doing something to him. Mind you, my phone is the music box right now so he's selecting the next song. The next song that plays is The thong song. Are you catching my drift? why would you ask me if i wore panties and then play that? yknow? thats a little wack. I finally grab my phone and i go to leave, still anxious and not feeling safe at this point.

THIS IS KEY INFO. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT THIS POINT. I'm thinking of every plausible bad thing going to happen to me so my motive is to leave right there. i say goodbye to someone and give them a hug and i leave. M1 follows me behind and he's over here trying to get me to stay, saying ""theres no need to leave, youre incapable to drive. i have 2 rooms."" and basically tryna grt me to go to the bathroom. im really trying to leave at this point so whether he means it like that or if hes reallh trying to be respectful, i just wanna go home. im over thinking and i need to leave. I also knew my coworker wanted to get with him so i was TRYING to avoid that scenario regardless... he ends up giving me a hug and i leave and immediately call my friend up and we talk until im home. 

i end up telling her what M2 said and she feels for me and is like ""oh my god im sorry, i didnt know that happened."" and then i tell her about M1 and she immediately gets defensive and gaslights me.

A slight TW for topics about abuse


So I got in a pretty rough fight with my friend the other night while we where at my step dads place. I’m on vacation helping my grandmother out in NY, which is a trip my step dad paid for as a thank you for helping. I used to live here so I have some friends in the area and my dad said we could use his lake house to throw a party and have fun for 4th of July. It’s a absolutely beautiful three story house in the mountains of NY with a water trampoline and hot tub, it’s absolutely perfect for throwing parties. 

I had a small get together with about 7 friends, we drank pina coladas (or I like to call peenies) and swam in the lake and lit some fireworks off. When we went back on the water trampoline around night time, my phone was still in my shorts pocket and I didn’t realize, it got completely soaked for about 10 mins while I was swimming out to the trampoline before I noticed. I got on the trampoline and pulled it out my pocket, just for it to be absolutely soaked and not turning on. It was cracked super bad on the back so I assumed that water got in the phone through there since you could basically see the parts in the phone. I swam back inside with the phone in the air and when I tried to revive it inside the house with rice and shaking the water out, no luck, it only really turned on for a few seconds before shutting back off with the temperature symbol on the screen.

I was super upset about the phone since I don’t go back to work until the 15th of July and was already making ends meet while trying to have money for my vacation, I ended up breaking out in hives because I was stressed (which is common for me) so I called it a night and told everyone else I was going to lay down and chill for the night, I borrowed my gf’s phone and texted my grandmother the number if she had a emergency or needed anything (she lived down the road) along with my dad since he wanted updates on the party. 
The next day was chill, mostly cleaning up from all the mess we made during the party, my dad called asking what happened and I explained I was pretty upset over the phone situation and was ready to call it quits and go home so I can go back to working, he said he was sorry for me that my phone was broken, he said he could come pick me up and bring me back to my car at my grandmothers house later that afternoon as long as the house is done being cleaned up (nothing too serious since he has cleaners that come every Monday) 

Whenever he came to pick me up he Surprised me with a new iPhone 14, saying that he’s happy I’m visiting him in NY and that we needed a way to contact anyways so it would do me good. I was ofc super happy and grateful, I wasn’t expecting a new phone from him since I am in my 20’s and have my own money. I then left with my dad and others leaving the house (most left the night before but the drunk ones stayed the night) 

Whenever I got back with my car and at my grandmothers house where I’m staying, I set up my new phone and redownloaded my apps, which includes Snapchat, where we have a group chat that’s been ongoing since high school. There was a conversation I missed about my party and the new phone, one of the girls, I’ll call her olive for a coverup name, said that I’m lucky Im a “nepo baby”, and got a new phone instantly, and how I had “it all handed to me” unlike when hers broke a month or two back ago, she had to pick up extra shifts to buy another. Everyone in the gc just kinda went around it and continued to talk about the party and how fun it was/posting photos from it.

I texted her privately saying I understand she may be upset beacuse she had to work extra for a phone, but that she knows how much I’ve struggled in the past to get where I am, and that I do not rely on my parents for housing or jobs, and that I don’t appreciate being called a nepo baby.

For context, my “step dad” I talk about is my “adoptive dad”, I was taken away by cps when I was about 12, I struggled with pretty extreme absuive from my mother, that left me with CPTSD, I got placed with my “step dad” who was a family friend who we where extremely close with. My mom at that point had scared me into thinking everyone who she didn’t like was evil and was out to hurt me and manipulate me, I was terrified to indulge myself in eating, picking out clothes, having a personality in general around them, in fear that my mom would find out I’m associating myself with the people that she hates. I ended up getting placed with my biological dad in Missouri about two years later, since biological is more important in the system. Which was not much better, it was okay at first but then we moved into his sisters mold and bug ridden basement, we often had no food and no AC in the Missouri heat. It took me untill I was 16 to reach back out to my adoptive parent and thank them, we started getting closer and they even paid for a few trips out to NY to visit them, I ended up getting closer with them then I did my actual dad, since, in my mind, he was just some drunk who I moved in with when I was 14. I got kicked out when I was 18, I was living in my car for multiple months and had figured out I have a heart condition which rendered me unable to do most jobs/activities. So trying to find work while living in my car was awful.

I will say, my step dad does and did give me money while I was homeless, he offered to buy me a house or condo of my choice if I were to move to NY with him, and would set me up with a nice job in his company, but my doctors where all in MO along with other disability/lawyer commitments so I had to politely decline, I also don’t like taking from them as much as I do, they send me money quite often for medical bills and to make ends meet, and send me on vacation to NY to see them multiple times a year, which is way more than I can ever ask for.

And she knows ALL OF THIS. She was there when I got taken away by cps, she knows I’ve had it hard before, granted I’m in a apartment and doing okay now. 
 
Back to the story:

She ignored my text, I later called her the next day to talk about it, since things like this weigh heavy on my mind, I was hoping she wasent too upset at me or anything, and was hoping she would take back or apologize for what she said, I just wanted understanding, which is a little selfish of me I know. 

She started going off about how it was just a joke and I didn’t need to take it so seriously, i told her that it still kinda hurt my feelings, so I would appreciate if she wouldn’t make that joke again for my sake, she knows what I’ve been through. She said “just admit your privileged, you literally got a phone the next day while you staying in a giant ass lake house, you’ve literally got it easy right now, why are you acting all fucking snobby about it?” 

I didn’t really know what to say, I have a bit of a issue with shutting down, I just kinda went “okay sorry” and went on. 
I felt too awkward to talk, I was in a bit of bad mood and didn’t really need that right now, so i decided to stay home from our morning plans with the group to go to a farmers market, I didn’t really want to talk about it or bring drama into the group, so I’d figured I’d let it pass until I was feeling up to talk about it. I told my girlfriend I wouldn’t be going but no one else, since she only knew the situation and no one else in the group. 
I later got some texts from olive saying how I really didn’t need to overreact and ingore the group like that, and how I’m turning this into drama for the whole group, and that it was “just a stupid comment, get over it”
It’s been awhile since I talked to the group, I didn’t know any of them where like that, I get I’m a little privileged for having some great adoptive family, and I may be a little biased for it. But to say I’m a nepo baby that’s had everything handed to me?!? There’s no way that’s true. RIGHT?!?!? RIGHT GUYS?!?! Uhg this is killing me, I haven’t responded to her text at all btw, not sure what to say.

I was super upset about the phone since I don’t go back to work until the 15th of July and was already making ends meet while trying to have money for my vacation, I ended up breaking out in hives because I was stressed (which is common for me) so I called it a night and told everyone else I was going to lay down and chill for the night, I borrowed my gf’s phone and texted my grandmother the number if she had a emergency or needed anything (she lived down the road) along with my dad since he wanted updates on the party. 
The next day was chill, mostly cleaning up from all the mess we made during the party, my dad called asking what happened and I explained I was pretty upset over the phone situation and was ready to call it quits and go home so I can go back to working, he said he was sorry for me that my phone was broken, he said he could come pick me up and bring me back to my car at my grandmothers house later that afternoon as long as the house is done being cleaned up (nothing too serious since he has cleaners that come every Monday) 

Whenever he came to pick me up he Surprised me with a new iPhone 14, saying that he’s happy I’m visiting him in NY and that we needed a way to contact anyways so it would do me good. I was ofc super happy and grateful, I wasn’t expecting a new phone from him since I am in my 20’s and have my own money. I then left with my dad and others leaving the house (most left the night before but the drunk ones stayed the night) 

Whenever I got back with my car and at my grandmothers house where I’m staying, I set up my new phone and redownloaded my apps, which includes Snapchat, where we have a group chat that’s been ongoing since high school. There was a conversation I missed about my party and the new phone, one of the girls, I’ll call her olive for a coverup name, said that I’m lucky Im a “nepo baby”, and got a new phone instantly, and how I had “it all handed to me” unlike when hers broke a month or two back ago, she had to pick up extra shifts to buy another. Everyone in the gc just kinda went around it and continued to talk about the party and how fun it was/posting photos from it.

I texted her privately saying I understand she may be upset beacuse she had to work extra for a phone, but that she knows how much I’ve struggled in the past to get where I am, and that I do not rely on my parents for housing or jobs, and that I don’t appreciate being called a nepo baby.

For context, my “step dad” I talk about is my “adoptive dad”, I was taken away by cps when I was about 12, I struggled with pretty extreme absuive from my mother, that left me with CPTSD, I got placed with my “step dad” who was a family friend who we where extremely close with. My mom at that point had scared me into thinking everyone who she didn’t like was evil and was out to hurt me and manipulate me, I was terrified to indulge myself in eating, picking out clothes, having a personality in general around them, in fear that my mom would find out I’m associating myself with the people that she hates. I ended up getting placed with my biological dad in Missouri about two years later, since biological is more important in the system. Which was not much better, it was okay at first but then we moved into his sisters mold and bug ridden basement, we often had no food and no AC in the Missouri heat. It took me untill I was 16 to reach back out to my adoptive parent and thank them, we started getting closer and they even paid for a few trips out to NY to visit them, I ended up getting closer with them then I did my actual dad, since, in my mind, he was just some drunk who I moved in with when I was 14. I got kicked out when I was 18, I was living in my car for multiple months and had figured out I have a heart condition which rendered me unable to do most jobs/activities. So trying to find work while living in my car was awful.

I will say, my step dad does and did give me money while I was homeless, he offered to buy me a house or condo of my choice if I were to move to NY with him, and would set me up with a nice job in his company, but my doctors where all in MO along with other disability/lawyer commitments so I had to politely decline, I also don’t like taking from them as much as I do, they send me money quite often for medical bills and to make ends meet, and send me on vacation to NY to see them multiple times a year, which is way more than I can ever ask for.

And she knows ALL OF THIS. She was there when I got taken away by cps, she knows I’ve had it hard before, granted I’m in a apartment and doing okay now. 
 
Back to the story:

She ignored my text, I later called her the next day to talk about it, since things like this weigh heavy on my mind, I was hoping she wasent too upset at me or anything, and was hoping she would take back or apologize for what she said, I just wanted understanding, which is a little selfish of me I know. 

She started going off about how it was just a joke and I didn’t need to take it so seriously, i told her that it still kinda hurt my feelings, so I would appreciate if she wouldn’t make that joke again for my sake, she knows what I’ve been through. She said “just admit your privileged, you literally got a phone the next day while you staying in a giant ass lake house, you’ve literally got it easy right now, why are you acting all fucking snobby about it?” 

I didn’t really know what to say, I have a bit of a issue with shutting down, I just kinda went “okay sorry” and went on. 
I felt too awkward to talk, I was in a bit of bad mood and didn’t really need that right now, so i decided to stay home from our morning plans with the group to go to a farmers market, I didn’t really want to talk about it or bring drama into the group, so I’d figured I’d let it pass until I was feeling up to talk about it. I told my girlfriend I wouldn’t be going but no one else, since she only knew the situation and no one else in the group. 
I later got some texts from olive saying how I really didn’t need to overreact and ingore the group like that, and how I’m turning this into drama for the whole group, and that it was “just a stupid comment, get over it”
It’s been awhile since I talked to the group, I didn’t know any of them where like that, I get I’m a little privileged for having some great adoptive family, and I may be a little biased for it. But to say I’m a nepo baby that’s had everything handed to me?!? There’s no way that’s true. RIGHT?!?!? RIGHT GUYS?!?! Uhg this is killing me, I haven’t responded to her text at all btw, not sure what to say. ",,0.0052772825583815575,0,0

My eldest daughter (14F) has always been  a bit difficult to raise since she started therapy at the age of six.

The issue is that now that she's a teenager, she makes up excuses about her mental health. We had to go to a psychiatrist because her original psychologist said that she might have been autistic. The psychiatrist claims that she's a normal kid that has severe anxiety and possibly depression, and asked me to behave around her since she complained mostly about me.

A few weeks ago, she skipped her after school lessons and, when I confronted her, lied about her being ""too mentally exhausted"" and needed some rest. I tried explaining to her that it was a waste of money paying for her lessons if she was going to skip, but she remained stubborn saying that she had let her mother know that she wasn't going that day. I got annoyed and lashed out at her about how she's wasting the money I make, in which my daughter replied with her mental and physical health being important to her.
 
(To clarify. A few months before that we had to go to the doctors three times that week because she had chest and stomach pains, which she said made her extremely tired.

31,1dxrzwx,AITA for asking my friend to reimburse me for my curling wand and makeup?,"I 25F went out last night to a party with a few close friends including Zara 24F. It was open bar, so all of us were drinking quite a bit, and Zara was doing shots. About an hour in, she had clearly had way too much, and as I lived walking distance away and had the least to drink, I offered to take Zara back to my place. 

Zara was very apologetic at my house and kept insisting I go back to the party and enjoy myself and that she was fine, she just wanted to change and sleep. I went to get her some clothes to change into, and she threw up all over herself, and near my dressing table. 

I helped her shower and go to bed, and I bleached the area she threw up. I have a single bed, which I gave to Zara and took my roommates bed. 

In the middle of the night, Sara woke up and opened all my windows as she found the bleach smell overpowering. I have the loft room so I have sloped skylight windows. It rained overnight, and as Zara opened the window, it drenched my curling wand and an eyeshadow palette that was left open on my dressing table. 

I came in this morning and that side of the room had flooded in with the water. Zara helped clean it up and apologised and said the bleach smell was very strong.

She had left, and only after that I remembered the curling wand still plugged in as my makeup that was left on the table. I unplugged the curling wand and will probably have to trash the ruined makeup as it can get mold now that it is wet. 

I texted Zara an hour ago to check in that she was feeling better after last night and asked her to reimburse me for the curling wand and makeup that was ruined by the rain. She has just left me on delivered.

33,1dxruoh,AITA For suggesting to a friend that his condo isn’t perfect. ,"I’m new here, so sorry for any formatting or grammar issues. My (24M) old college roommate, Jim (27M), recently bought a condo. It’s on the smaller side, but he’s very proud to own his own place. It also needs quite a bit of work to get properly finished. When he first got it, he invited a bunch of our friends to a housewarming party to show it off. When we checked out the place. We had some concerns since Jim isn’t the handiest and tends to get angry quickly.

Jim invited the same group to another party a couple weeks later, and his condo hadn't changed much since the first visit. He said he wants to take his time and make sure everything is perfect and up to his standards. This time, a new buddy of ours who was out of town for the first visit decided to join us; let's call him  
Bill.

This whole situation started when Bill tried to refill the toilet paper fixture. When he tried to take out the holder, the fixture that was dangling from the first visit fell out of the wall onto the floor. Bill immediately told Jim about the fixture falling out of the wall and apologized. In front of everyone, Jim blew up at Bill, saying things like, “I invite you into my home, and you do something like this,” He didn’t let Bill get a word in and kept putting him down.

Jim eventually cooled down a bit but was still visibly angry at Bill, making underhanded comments  
like, 'Wow, don’t sit down too hard, or you'll break that too."" After each comment, it was just awkward. Later that night, when Bill was in another room, Jim turned to us and started criticizing Bill to the rest of us again. This is where I might be the AH. I told Jim that I saw the fixture half in the wall on our last visit and that it wasn’t Bill’s fault it fell out. I mentioned that the previous owner left damages elsewhere, so it shouldn’t be out of the question that the fixture was already broken. Jim turned red and started yelling at me, asking why I was getting involved and that Bill should take responsibility for his mistake. He accused me of making excuses for Bill and said he didn’t want to hear them. I tried to calm things down, and eventually, we dropped the subject.

The next day, Jim approached Bill and me, sat us down, and started by half-heartedly apologizing  
to Bill before immediately turning to me and asked, “'Now what do you have to say for yourself?” expecting an apology. I told him I wasn’t going to apologize for standing up for Bill.

We are very blessed to have good friends who share their lake house with us. It was our second time going to the lake this summer. We haven’t been going out and seeing our friends much this year, mostly due to my health issues and factors related to them.

We were a couple of hours into hanging out in a cove at the lake. Enjoying the hot sun, cool water, cold beer and good conversation. My wife went to get another round of beers and was asking who needed one. Playfully referring to herself as the beer wench.

Our friend wanted a beer and I added that I’ll have one. My wife said to me from the shore: “I bought the beers. I loaded the cooler. I got the ice.” I told my wife never mind, I’m good, I don’t need a drink. She walked down the dock and tossed the beer to me. I didn’t touch it and left the beer floating in the water with us.

A few minutes later my wife said: “I didn’t mean anything by what I said, I was kidding around, I even called myself the beer wench. Please have your beer.”  I coldly said: “no thanks, you made point after point, and I agree with you, they are your beers.”  I didn’t have any drinks the rest of the time at the lake. Our friends didn’t say anything, staying out of it. There was a tension created by the beer situation.

My wife was accurate in what she said about her getting everything ready. She does nearly all of the grocery shopping and often takes the lead on getting things ready for outings. In general I think we have a pretty good division of labor. The previous day I worked around the house until about 9 pm while she was getting things ready for the outing. I pumped gas while she went in to get the bag of ice.

I would then sit with him on my lap petting him for a couple of minutes until he left.

Oliver was all boy and didn’t really snuggle, but that was our special time. When camping with several other couples my wife called me out, saying, “You wouldn’t believe what he does with the dog”. Going on to tell the story making it sound really stupid and demeaning, laughing at my expense.

36,1dxrkdg,WIBTA For Asking A Friend To Use Our Baby Shower Registry Instead Of Her Niece’s Hand-Me-Downs? ,"We’re having our baby shower in a few weeks and it’s been great to see how excited everyone has been for our child and the party. 

On top of that, we already have a lot of people using our registry to purchase gifts. 

There’s only one friend who has been talking for months about giving us her niece’s hand-me-downs which is very kind of her. 

However, as the baby shower approaches, she has made it clear that she now intends to give us these clothes for the shower, rather than just in general. She has also asked us a few times about whether there is a registry, which I guess she decided she doesn’t feel the need to use. 

We don’t know this family member who she’s getting these clothes from. There’s a good chance our future daughter won’t actually use them. But she can no longer make the shower due to legit reasons and is sending the hand-me-downs via her boyfriend to the party.

",Asshole,2024-07-07,"WIBTA For Asking A Friend To Use Our Baby Shower Registry Instead Of Her Niece’s Hand-Me-Downs?  We’re having our baby shower in a few weeks and it’s been great to see how excited everyone has been for our child and the party. 

On top of that, we already have a lot of people using our registry to purchase gifts. 

There’s only one friend who has been talking for months about giving us her niece’s hand-me-downs which is very kind of her. 

However, as the baby shower approaches, she has made it clear that she now intends to give us these clothes for the shower, rather than just in general. She has also asked us a few times about whether there is a registry, which I guess she decided she doesn’t feel the need to use. 

We don’t know this family member who she’s getting these clothes from. There’s a good chance our future daughter won’t actually use them. But she can no longer make the shower due to legit reasons and is sending the hand-me-downs via her boyfriend to the party.

37,1dxrcpl,AITA for telling my aunt no one's in a rush to live her boring life,"I (14f) have an aunt who's been visiting my mom's house recently. This is because she has been fighting with my cousin (16f) because they don't want to babysit their siblings anymore. My aunt has a 11-year-old, 7-year-old, two 3-year-olds, and another on the way. She drops them off at my mom's house so my mom can watch them.

I really don't mind having my cousins around and initially, I didn't even mind when that my aunt was around more often. However, it's just been getting annoying. My aunt is a SAHM and wants even more kids after this one is born, and she keeps mentioning her lifestyle around me to mock mine.

For example, I have some summer work to do and I've been doing some extra work to get ahead for next year since I'm planning to join quite a few extracurriculars. Anytime I do work while my aunt is over, she always tells me how I'm wasting my time and I'm probably going to end up a mom like her being cared for by her husband. 

I try to tell her that I don't want to be a mom and want to have a good career but she keeps thinking my life plans are ""ludicrous."" She repeatedly complains to my mom that she's raising a daughter who's going to get no husband, and tells my cousins that I'm being a bad influence and that family always comes before work/school. 

It's gotten to a point where my mother has been telling my aunt to stop talking about her children (I have an older sister she complains about too) because my aunt keeps talking about how bad my sister and I's choices are and how horrible a mother my mom is for not teaching us that family should come first.

Yesterday, my aunt came over to pick her kids up again and decided she wanted to complain about me while I wasn't doing anything besides watching YT with the 7-year-old. She told me how happy she was that I was finally coming to my senses and to spend time with family and as soon as high school ends, I could be a good mother just like her. I was honestly pissed, so I told her that nobody wants to live a boring life like her and I'm  not rushing to have a baby on hip every other second like her.

My aunt got upset and quickly collected her kids before leaving. She even called my mom to tell me about what happened, which means I'm punished and I have to stay at my dad's house for a bit so my aunt could drop off her kids and feel comfortable.

39,1dxr3ms,AITA for telling my daughters father that he cant make me transfer colleges,"(Throw away acct bc my ex knows my main reddit)

I (20sF) have a daughter (kindergartenF) who I'll calll Sage with my high school boyfriend (20sM)

I am a D1 basketball player in Texas (this is needed for context) and sorry if there Is any spelling or grammar mistakes, I jammed my finger at a practice and it's still wrapped up.

my whole family and ex boyfriend are from and still live in Phoenix AZ and me and my daughter live in Texas from July-March due to school and my basketball commitments, this arrangement was decided when i commited to my college and has been held true the past 3 years.

I went to Phoenix for 4th of July to spend it with my family and so my daughter and her father could be together for the weekend like we have since I went to college. Everything was fine and amazing until Saturday night when me and my ex, my dad, step mom and daughter all went out for a nice dinner together.

After the dinner my ex pulled me aside and told me that I HAVE to transfer colleges and programs since he can't keep doing this and he wants us to be a family again.

The thing is, this time of year is the only time he sees her dispite HIM being the one to push me to keep Sage when I found out I was pregnant. I give him plenty of chances to see her all year round since my mom has offered to take her back and forth between AZ and TX. He just never has and blows her off for god knows what.

I'm also a lesbian, he's known that for two years now. He barely calls or texts her, and only asks about Sage when his mother tells him too. All around he's a pretty absent father so I don't get the switch up.

this is where I might be the asshole, I yelled at him that ""even if I could transfer colleges and programs I can't, the portal is closed and I don't want to leave. I love my college, my teammates, my girlfriend and coaches. and that if he wanted to have a say in Sages life he shouldnt be such a fucking deadbeat who dodges child support and that he's lucky I haven't taken his sorry ass to court, that I'm not uprooting a 5yo just for him to play happy family with and throw us away when he gets bored again.""

hes done this once before too, he's always been jealous of my D1 commitments(he's very vocal about it) but this is the first time ever I've cursed him out. He spends all of the money that is due for child support on sports cars, vapes and sex workers too.

My step brother thinks I'm the asshole for cursing him out for wanting to be a more involved father. My dad and girlfriend are on my side and suggested I post this here. Everyone else is staying out of this.

I just want to get outside opinions on if I was the asshole or not since I do feel bad for cursing him out but I don't feel bad for what I said.

So my fiancé since the start of the relationship has always said that he’d like me to be a stay at home mom to raise our children when we have them, so I would need to stop working and put my career on pause. We plan to have 2 children so that would put me out of work for at least 6 years until the children go to school. 

I work in tech so the industry advances very fast so I worry about my ability to get back into the job market, because I myself don’t want to ideally sacrifice my career because I’ve put a lot of time and hard work into it to get to where I am today.

However with child care costs it works out financially better for me to stay home whilst the children aren’t in school.

The problem comes when my fiancé had a chat with his mom yesterday, it’s come to the point where his mom needs financial support every month, which puts strain on us with our mortgage payments. Both him and his family have told me how bad she is with money, she never has enough because she likes nice things, so I feel resentful

So he had a chat with me today with totally different opinions basically doing a 180 and says that I will have to go back to work because he needs to support his mom and it’d be too much pressure on him with all these responsibilities.

So I’ve felt really sad and feel like the whole time this idea and plan we have made for ourselves has suddenly gone out the window and feel like he is prioritising his mom over me, because I basically have to go back to work earlier in order for us to be able to pay for her.

I really need advice because me and my fiancé had a fight and I’m feeling upset about feeling like I’m being put second. That staying home with my children isn’t an option now.

Because he says this is not the case and isn’t what he’s doing but he also says him supporting his mom won’t affect us, but this is a direct affect.

So now I don’t feel safe leaving my career because I know it’ll be really hard to get back into with how fast the industry advances.

44,1dxq32z,AITA for telling my parents it's unfair to blame me for not saying my new sister's name correctly?,"I (16m) have speech issues. I have a stutter and I also have trouble making certain sounds as well. I did speech therapy when I was younger and I'm better than I was but still can't say some things correctly. I was my parents only child until now. My mom is pregnant with my baby sister. And they chose her name which is something I can't say correctly. The name is Michelle. I have a lot of trouble with the chell part and I don't say words like shell right either. My parents are really frustrated by it and they are saying I'm doing it intentionally because I don't like the fact it's a traditional name. They used the fact I want to change my name to say I'm being intentionally difficult. It hurts. They know I always struggled with this but now it's a great big issue. My stutter got worse because of the stress of my parents and now the name sounds even worse out of my mouth which angers them more. But I'm not doing it intentionally. I worked so hard for so long on the sounds.

My (maternal) grandparents spoke in my defense but mom told them to shut up and said they were encouraging me. She was already pissed because they offered to pay for me to change my name. My mom said it was so wrong and this was just another way for them to undermine her and my dad as my parents.

This led to me telling my parents it's unfair for them to blame me for saying the name wrong. I said it when they got on me again for how I was saying the name. They keep making me repeat it so I get it right. But I get worse because the pressure makes my stutter so bad. My parents told me I shouldn't talk to them about fair when I keep shitting on the names they love. Which I don't. I never said anything about Michelle and I regret telling them I hate my name and want something different (my name is Richard).

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-07,"AITA for telling my parents it's unfair to blame me for not saying my new sister's name correctly? I (16m) have speech issues. I have a stutter and I also have trouble making certain sounds as well. I did speech therapy when I was younger and I'm better than I was but still can't say some things correctly. I was my parents only child until now. My mom is pregnant with my baby sister. And they chose her name which is something I can't say correctly. The name is Michelle. I have a lot of trouble with the chell part and I don't say words like shell right either. My parents are really frustrated by it and they are saying I'm doing it intentionally because I don't like the fact it's a traditional name. They used the fact I want to change my name to say I'm being intentionally difficult. It hurts. They know I always struggled with this but now it's a great big issue. My stutter got worse because of the stress of my parents and now the name sounds even worse out of my mouth which angers them more. But I'm not doing it intentionally. I worked so hard for so long on the sounds.

My (maternal) grandparents spoke in my defense but mom told them to shut up and said they were encouraging me. She was already pissed because they offered to pay for me to change my name. My mom said it was so wrong and this was just another way for them to undermine her and my dad as my parents.

This led to me telling my parents it's unfair for them to blame me for saying the name wrong. I said it when they got on me again for how I was saying the name. They keep making me repeat it so I get it right. But I get worse because the pressure makes my stutter so bad. My parents told me I shouldn't talk to them about fair when I keep shitting on the names they love. Which I don't. I never said anything about Michelle and I regret telling them I hate my name and want something different (my name is Richard).

45,1dxpntk,AITA for yelling at a man who could have potentially needed help?,"I (24M) and my friend (23F) went camping together for the weekend. We enjoy the outdoors and noticed that the weather would be nice so, we decided to go camping for a night.

It’s worth mentioning that this campsite is fairly secluded so, unless someone else intended on camping at this specific spot I wouldn’t expect anybody to come out there. You have to walk a ways off the trail to even access it.

It was around 8:30PM and we had started a campfire and made some hotdogs. As we were eating we heard walking maybe 10-15 yards behind us. We had heard twigs crunching earlier but it’s the forest so we didn’t think anything of it but this was blatant walking sounds.

I got up and looked around and my friend told me to sit down and ignore it. I wasn’t scared or anything, I just thought it was strange that someone would be hiking out here this late. Usually to camp you come at least in the afternoon, not dark.

I didn’t see anything and we sat up for an hour then went to bed. We had been laying in our tents for about twenty minutes and then I heard the walking sounds again except they were definitely in our campsite, not near it this time.

I quickly unzipped my tent and saw a middle aged man wearing cargo shorts and a flannel by my friend’s tent. He was already looking at me, he probably heard my tent unzip, but I still decided to yell and ask what he was doing. My friend unzipped his tent and got out and the dude in the flannel put his arms up and started apologizing and saying that he was hurt.

I could see him well cause of the fire light but I couldn’t see every part of him like I could if it was daytime. I asked what he was doing by our tents and he said that he cut his side while hiking and needed help, he saw a light coming from our side of the woods and came over to us. 

I yelled at him to leave and told him to not come near us again and that if he did we would call the police. He apologized and walked away and my friend told me to calm down but I thought it was strange.

He very well could have needed help but why come up to someone’s tent late at night and not announce yourself? I also didn’t see any blood from what I could tell so I don’t know it was just strange. 

TLDR: Guy with no very visible injuries walked up to friends tent late at night and claimed to need help. I yelled at him because it was suspicious.

46,1dxp2cn,AITA for not caring about my brothers future?,"I (18F) have recently graduated from high school and am starting my research for universities to apply to for my intake in February. My brother (19M) has graduated two years ago, has retaken exams just to fail them again and continues to live in my parents house doing jack shit n fuck all for the last two years. His routine consists of waking up at 1pm and wasting away on his pc for hours on end playing video games with his friends who are enablers. He has no aspirations, no will, no direction in life and doesn’t plan to change it any time soon. 

This isn’t my responsibility so I haven’t really been paying mine to it regardless of him being my blood. Until my dad decided to give me the task of doing his university research. I wouldn’t have been against it if my brother wasn’t such a bum that gets everything handed to him on a plate. So I refused and my dad snapped calling me selfish for not aiding my brother.My dad also wants him to be at the same place as me so he can “watch over me” as if it wouldn’t be vise versa. He went as far as to threaten not paying for my university to get me scared. 

For a little background, the reason my parent s are so passive with what he does is because they’re scared he’s going to lose it, I won’t go into much detail due to it being triggering but back in middle school he was a huge cause of concern, failing his exams after being bullied by both peers and teachers causing him to make extreme decisions and even running away.  

Although I understand where it stems from, I refuse to baby him. I don’t want to take on the role of his caregiver just for him to continue to be the bum he is. I couldn’t care less if he were to waste his life away and end up homeless as long as it’s not my responsibility to get him back on his feet.

This neighbor is generally superficial. Friendly on the outside but a terrible neighbor to his next door neighbors. 

A few months ago I realized not only was I the one who always said hi first, but I was usually on the receiving end of a passive aggressive comment (referring to dogs peeing on the public grass between the street and sidewalk or some comment about my lawn). For reference, he is an early retiree and is almost always outside doing something with his grass.

So l decided to stop saying hi. The reaction was tense and immediate. An exaggerated ""oh hi how are you?"". All because I didn't say hi first.  Last week, as I was walking by, he was in his side yard as I walked by. I reflexively looked over but then just kept walking.

Im on here for some advice and help, the reddit community can be straightforward and helpful when it comes to advice lol.

Just to make it clear, in our household its just me (14) and my mum (40) and my little sister (3). For a little backstory, my mum and my dad (whose still in my life) have been always having problems, my dad was most definitely a narcissist looking back at the fights they had, me always having to be in the middle of it ,would always have to act like my dad was in the right when with him when i knew he wasnt. He wasnt at home alot but always treated me with holidays and whatever i wanted (still does if i dont piss him off lol). They divorced 2 years ago, the final point was when my dad suddenly announced he would be booking a holiday with his family back home in the middle of ours, I think one of the main reasons my parents always argued was because of how my dad prioritized his family back home instead of us, like he promised my mum a house after years of living at my grandmas but instead gave us a cheap 2 bedroom apartment and decided to invest back to his family in his home country (to clarify I mean his parents and siblings not a second wife lol)

In about October 2022 my mum was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, I remember that day so visibly stressing out and having breakdowns for a week. After a while I got used to coping with the stress. Now for the main part, Im not sure when but i recall me and my mum's relationship getting worse and worse, she would shout I would retaliate, I try and think of all reasons, maybe the medication? The stress of my little sibling, which I think is the main reason, whenever my sister is at my dad or my grandmas me and my mum always have the best time. I write this mainly because my mum and I always argue, every single day she gets angr7y because in her opinion im lazy and dont help but in my eyes, she nitpicks everything and goes on and on, she just shouts, I know she loves me though because she has never hurt me. I want to be a good son but I think its time I use the help of other people who arent my family, obviously being biased to my mum when she tells them about our scuffles and problems.

52,1dxnnb5,AITA for not giving my father money?,"
I, 18 F, have a family with not that many resources. We are the kind of family that live paycheck to paycheck, which is sad mostly because we could be living a better life that we are now, but my father decided not to and let me tell you why. 
My father, a man around his late 50s was kind of wealthy at some point, his parents died when he was mid 20s and left him and his brothers a lot of money which most of them used to build their house and save up for a better life. My father, on the other hand, decided to party and have the cars he wanted with that money, not saving even single penny of what he earned. 
Later in life got a tiny house and met my mom and here I am, with a mother frustrated for having an incompetent husband and an alcoholic father that refuses to leave the state he is in. 
Everyday he comes home with his lunchbox and beer, like 5 bottles of 2L each one, and he drinks them in just one day. At first when he did not had any money for beer he'll just get another credit card and buy more (he has a LOT of debt through many cred cards now and he has to give a lot of his paycheck every time) but now I'm 18, I've been working since 15 because I knew I wasn't gonna progress if I lived up to my family, I buy things I need and I even paid my high-school full. I don't have a job now but I'm searching for one and I'm saving for my first semester of uni but here's the deal... A lot of times my father would ask me for money to cover expenses of his own, I'm not talking about beer but more like gasoline of even sometimes food. I wouldnt be that pissed to give my family money if it wasn't for the fact that I know that my father would have the money for it if it wasn't for the fact that he waste most of it in paying debt and alcohol. I am so tired and my mom is also tired of living with this, I simply cannot spend a whole day without crying because my father, as the incompetent man that he is, sometimes do good stuff like buying my fav coke and helping me with chores and even helping me in a lot of stuff I cannot do on my own. 
I feel so sad and so angry and desperate everytime this happens, when he asks me for money I swear I start to cry, I re-live everytime my mother told me more bad news about my father but I also think about the times he was a good man and I get so fucking confused. 
I know it's just giving him money, I know it may not sound like a big deal but I get so stressed out I don't know what else to do or even how to tell him that I don't want to give him money. 
At last, as an anecdote that might help, once he asked me for money as the moment I told him I did not had he started to tell at me and insult me telling me I was a bitch and an asshole.

56,1dxn4tt,WIBTA if I stop helping my unemployed relative with rent to save up for a vacation?,"I've (33F) been no-contact with family for 8 years. They were abusive every way you can think of. Been working things out in therapy, soon being evaluated for autism per multiple therapists' suggestions, which I mention because I see similarities in my brother Will(30M) there. Will was abused/traumatized by family too.



Got into a career in healthcare IT in 2019, so I've been lucky in a way and haven't experienced pandemic job insecurity. Though it's still hard sometimes. I think I have been in fluctuating stages of burnout for the past year. Also, my spouse (35M) has MS and is still working, but might not be able to stay full-time in the next few years because of it. My income can keep us afloat if necessary, though it would be paycheck-to-paycheck then.



The only family I talk to are 2 siblings, one of whom is Will. Before recently, it was over a year since last time we talked. Will worked a lot in tech/IT too, and lives alone with no debt. His job let him go in April because of some performance issue (in his words; I don't know specifics). I've talked to Will 4 times in the past month. One conversation was catching up. The other 3 were asking for money for his bills since his unemployment claim was denied and he ran out of savings. We'd just replaced our car so I couldn't help the first time, but someone else did. The times I helped him, it emptied my savings. I made clear in text/calls that I couldn't guarantee much or anything more than those.



Spouse and I are planning a vacation that we're going to start saving for, for our 10th anniversary. We'll be gone 5 days but were able to get 2 weeks of paid vacation off work to rest before and after the trip too. We don't go out of town much - it's been 2 years since the last time we did. I know it won't fix my burnout but I feel I need this. Will does not know about it, and he won't, but I'm not helping anymore.



When I sent Will money last week, he was annoyed I did not have more (I covered his rent). He ended the call saying ""I know you get paid around the 19th. I'll talk to you then."" Spouse is pissed and dislikes that Will seems to have assumed I'm supplementing his unemployment.



I'm also having a hard time believing he cannot find a job. He's admitted to not applying for some because he only wants to do a certain type of work. He also told me he feels burned out too and I believe him, but I can't fathom being picky about a job in his shoes. He's also said he does 4-5 applications a week and isn't looking into why he was denied unemployment. He's in a different state; don't know how it works for him.



I'm not bothered at him doing things he enjoys that aren't hurting his financial situation for his sanity. He suffered because of our family.

57,1dxmylf,AITA For Not Criticizing My Friend ,"So myself (28f) and some friends went on an overnight trip. I shared a bed with one friend (28f) for the night. We already knew that she’s snores a little and turns in her sleep nothing major; brought earplugs as a precaution. We joked about it even.

Despite that, I am not used to sleeping in the same bed as another person and I did not sleep well with the snores and movement. 

I didn’t want to complain about something my friend can’t help, especially since we had already talked about it, so I didn’t say anything. She ended up asking how I slept and I simply said not well; it was nothing to worry about. She assumed the conclusion that it was her fault and now is asking me what she did wrong.

I told her she didn’t do anything wrong; it’s nothing she can help and I wasn’t used to it. 

I don’t think she actually snores loud or moves a lot, just not what I’m used to. 

Now she’s upset that I’m withholding information. She already knows she snores and moves around so what more can I say? She says she just wants to know what it was and that she’s obsessing about my answer. I keep saying that she doesn’t need to worry about it and that I would feel like I’m complaining about her. She said she needs to know for the future. I don’t quite understand what that means. 

So is this an obsessive tick that she needs to scratch or was I actually being mean? Now I’m feeling guilty over this small thing because she wants me to tell her what’s wrong when she didn’t do anything wrong. Is this just a clashing of opposing feelings? Is she self flagellating and wants me to provide confirmation? I’m so confused on what I can do other than start complaining to her.

She estimated 3 hours of work a day and I could get another job as long as her kids got to school and home and there was dinner in the table in exchange for a free place to live (1 bedroom for me and 2 kids), free food, a car with all expenses paid, and gas. 

I turned it down because she was just trying to get cheap labor and she told our friends that I clearly don’t need help because I could’ve had all of our expenses paid and had the opportunity to get a job while my expenses were paid but I turned it down. 

About a month later I reached out and told her I’d do it for $1000 a month but she declined, saying she had already gotten an au pair. 

I told her the kids and I were facing eviction and asked if she could help us out but she refused. I texted our other friends but they also refused, saying I had an opportunity to help myself and our friend months ago but refused because of my ego so I put myself in this situation. 

We’ve gotten into arguments about me refusing to work for free somehow means I don’t deserve some help or how it means my kids and I deserve to be homeless but they all say I had an opportunity to get us into a better living situation and that beggars can’t be choosers.

I (30F) am not a big football (soccer) fan, but I really enjoy the excitement and joy of the European Championship (EM), especially since some of the games are happening in my hometown, Berlin. I supported the German team because it’s fun, I like the spirit, and I appreciate the idea of coming together as Europeans. I also watched the Portuguese games, but it was less fun for me as someone who doesn’t fully understand football. I often ask people about certain events during the game and try to learn the rules. 

I speak Portuguese and enjoy both cultures because I was born here and am also a German citizen. My family is mixed with many different identities. I consider myself a German with a Portuguese migration background, which is normal to say in Germany. For me, I don’t see myself as ethnically German, but I am a proud European citizen and genuinely love Berlin.

Now that both Portugal and Germany are out of the EM, I still love the EM spirit. 

My sister, Bella, is a hardcore Portugal fan. I texted my sister in a joyful way, asking if she was still willing to watch any games with us, and inviting her to watch the semi-finals and have burgers at a place that shows the games. The conversation escalated, and she got furious.

For context, I have been supporting her new job by picking up or bringing my nephew from kindergarten. She gave me the key to her apartment. I have a tech job, work from home, and can take time for the little guy if necessary. He enjoys spending time with me too, and when his dad comes home, I go back home and continue my work.

In summary, she started criticizing my sense of belonging and questioning whether I am German or Portuguese. I tried to explain that her feelings are valid, but mine are different. For me, it’s just football, and I enjoy the fun of it. She became very aggressive. I tried to de-escalate, but at one point, I wrote “THEN TOUGH LUCK, MATE!” because I was fed up with being treated poorly.

She then said if I liked, I didn’t have to bring my nephew to kindergarten anymore. I replied that I would still bring him to kindergarten, but if it were her wish that I never contact her again, I could bring back the keys to her home that I have.

I thought for a long time about whether I should really return the keys or not. I think she wrote that to provoke me, and the only thing she could latch onto was the “THEN TOUGH LUCK, MATE!” 

Actually, I would have continued picking him up despite the argument, but I thought about it for a long time. At that moment, I was fed up with her attitude and the fact that it was taken for granted that I would support her, no matter how badly she treated me or snapped at me. 

I also didn’t want my nephew, to suffer because of it but at that moment, it was the healthiest thing for my mental health to distance myself.

64,1dxmanv,AITA for telling my sister her dog is annoying? ,"I (23F) and my sister (30F) now live in the same town and she just bought a house here. She’s also 6 months pregnant so I have been trying to spend some time helping them move in. EVERY TIME I come to her house, her dog jumps up to greet me and then continues to do it whenever he wants to. For context, I have been a dog sitter for 4 years and grew up with dogs, and in my opinion this is an undesirable behavior. Her dog is only 25 lbs but he has really sharp nails (barely makes a difference even right after trimming) and now that they have a yard his paws get dirty. I have tried telling him to sit (she gets mad at me because I give the command too “sternly”) , ignoring him, turning around etc. None of it works without treats so I usually just bend over to pet him and basically hold him down. 

We have had multiple conversations/arguments about this before but I try to not make a big deal about it when I go over. Yesterday, my sister brought it up on her own, claiming that if she wanted to train him out of it she could but it’s too much effort right now because she won’t be able to be 100% consistent. I told her I don’t think fear of not being perfectly consistent is a reason not to try. She said I am the ONLY person who is annoyed by this behavior and other people “like it” and “think it’s cute”. She also said getting dirty paw prints on your white pants is just “part of having a dog” and if you don’t like it don’t get one - compared it to, “if you don’t like having spitup on you then don’t have a baby” lol. I told her it’s annoying because it hurts and I don’t want my clothes ruined, and I guarantee more people feel the same way they’re just not telling her. 

Now I feel awkward about going over there and interacting with her dog. She gets super defensive about it and I’m not sure why. AITA for telling her?

65,1dxm55r,AITA for making a joke about my mentally ill sister on social media?,"I (37 f) have a younger sister (35 f) who was diagnosed with schizophrenia years ago. She has struggled with paranoia especially, but also other issues. Primarily though it's paranoia and I'm nearly always the one she comes to because she trusts me more than anyone. My parents have kind of resented this and said I don't take her diagnosis seriously. She placed me as her guardian in her PAD should she be incoherent or admitted. This also made them angry. They have always wanted her shut up in an institution. I do daily routine video calls with her at the same time every day. Pop in to count her meds. She has always been agreeable to take them but it's just to make sure she remembers. She signed a waiver for me to talk to her therapist and psychiatrist with any important changes. I also do monthly training at her therapist's office for crisis intervention. She has a job she loves, pays her own bills, and has an active social life. With regular therapy, stress management, and balanced meds, she only has bouts rarely. 

Now comes the joke. She has always recognized that she has a serious condition but she likes to make light of it to cope. Her therapist knows that and says it's perfectly normal. She jokes a lot herself, especially with her tshirts. Things like: I may be schizophrenic, but at least I'm not boring, Fresh out of the loony bin, I prefer grippy socks, and Tie my shoes? I don't even get shoelaces. When she met my husband, she barked at him because he didn't know what to say to him and after that they were besties. When we went to a convention she wrote ""Crazy Pants"" on her name tag. Basically, she loves when people just go along with her jokes. It's definitely isn't 24/7 or excessive and only with people she knows. She doesn't even discuss it with her coworkers, etc. She knows when it is appropriate and when it isn't. She is very capable of being professional, serious, and lucid. On a FB meme it asked who would you call if masked people broke into your house like the movie The Strangers. I said, My sister. She's medicated for a reason. I tagged her and she thought it was hilarious. I had it set to my private list (which is basically her and close relatives).

The next day my parents called and demanded I take it down because she doesn't know enough to be insulted for herself. That I'm cruel and if I were a decent sister, I would put her in a facility. Also I'm a bully and an asshole. She told them herself it was funny and ""more importantly true"" and laughed. Then said at least I'm not ashamed of her. 

AITA?
Edit: When I say people she knows, that obviously isn't with the name tag. It's more like the barking, etc.

We are very close with the high school friend couple, who we have considered our family. We are more casual friends with the other family. During Covid we had both sets of friends over to our house every weekend as we have a large yard and house.

(Guys you can call me the Ah, idc, but don't have to be so mean about it)

We are at an impass. Long story short, my significant other, or SO, rolled their ankle at a pool that is owned and operated by the county it is located in, paid entry only. We are considered visitors while the pool is considered the benefitter. 

They received no less than three terrible scrapes by trying to catch themselves, a severely bruised and sprained ankle. And bruises from the fall in general. I did take them to see someone about it, and thats when they determined the damage done.

 The accident was because of a slab of pavement used as the sidewalk that you could tell from elevated higher than the other parts, but at different angles (namely walking away from or at a different angle) was about an inch or so higher than the surrounding pavement slabs. 

After the staff helped them to the best of their abilities, they said that after filling out paperwork, they could get the supervisor of the pool to call me about what happened. I made sure to ask that signing the form did not make us waive our rights because of the incident.

The pool didn't have any clear signs before the fall or even after to indicate that there was a dangerous tripping hazard present.

SO doesn't want to pursue anything, but they can't walk or do a darn thing while they have this sprain. I want to pursue something because of the gross negligence of the park/pool and county. 

Would I be the AH if I contact someone on their behalf?",Asshole,2024-07-07,"WIBTAH if I talk to a slip and fall attorney when I was told not to?

We live far apart and have these long phone call catch-ups every few months.

I texted him about having a call this weekend and told him my availability, which I gave as a wide range.

He responded by saying, ""send a cal invite to my email""--did not address coordinating an actual time for the call.

I responded: ""[affectionate nickname I have for him], I say this with all possible love and respect, I am not going to do that.""

He says: ""Hey man, your call, if it's on my calendar, it happens. If not, *shrug emoji*

My response: ""I get that, but, again, with nothing but love and respect, it doesn't feel right for me to the one managing your calendar. My schedule is pretty flexible after Thursday morning, so if you wanna catch up, which I would love to do, lemme know when is good for you after Thursday morning and I'll ring ya then! If you need to use a calendar to keep track, I encourage it. I'm sorry, I'm really not trying to be a dick here, and maybe I'm just delicate or something, but for some reason that put me off.""

Then I followed it immediately with a voice note in a very amicable tone, that I'll transcribe exactly:

""I just wanna follow that up with a voice note, 'cause reading it again, it's kind of a nightmare to read--that text--without vocal tone. I don't if I'm just being, like, a snowflake or not, but it just, for some reason that just felt wrong to me. So that's all. Hopefully that makes sense. Anyways, lemme know your thoughts.

Two of them, Alex and Lucy, are dating and have been at the beach for the past week, and still have another week left. They have a small dog, and are paying another friend to live in the house and watch their dog for those two weeks. He’s an easy dog and I love the friend who is helping so i’ve been okay with that. 

Alex and Lucy are spending one week with one family, and one week with another family. Two days ago, the second family texted my roommate, Sue, who is home with me, if she could help watch their family dog because their usual sitter had something come up. She ran it by us and I said sure because she’s a really old dog and probably can’t handle and kennel or boarding place. 

Their family came on the way to vacation and dropped off the dog, and paid sue 200 dollars to watch her for the week. Everything was fine until it was time to go to bed. So the friend and Alex and Lucy’s dog were staying in one room, I have a cat so I stay in my own room, and Sue has a dog herself, so we were going to put this old dog in the guest room.

Well the other friend decided to sleep until noon, and I was stuck watching this old dog until he got up. Yesterday, because of their work schedules, I had to watch this old dog again. Usually I don’t mind dogs, but she’s bad as hell. 

Today I decided I wasn’t going to help at all. I’m not getting paid like the other two friends and I have my own cat to worry about. So this morning, I let her keep barking. I stayed in my room until around 11, and let the other friend take care of her. When I walked downstairs to leave to go visit my family, he seemed really annoyed that I had stayed in my room and didn’t help out at all.

81,1dxj395,AITA for asking my roommate to move out after they ignored me?,"Sorry for formatting. On mobile. 
My roommate (25) and I (28) have been living together for about two and a half years. We used to be friends but recently had a bad falling out that had to be resolved with the help of a mutual friend. In this falling out, my roommate had decided the friendship was over several months before telling me/deciding to do anything about it. They gave me the silent treatment for weeks before I decided we needed to have a mediated talk. 

Post our mediated discussion, we agreed that we were not going to be friends, just roommates. But my roommate isn’t even treating me as well as they would a stranger! They don’t say anything to me unless I say something first, and when they do speak it’s just “hi” or “good morning” or during our weekly roommate meetings where we discuss chores/household matters. 

Recently, they’ve even been leaving the room when I come in. They don’t say anything, they just get up and go to their room. They glare at me. I find this extremely hurtful, especially in the wake of their weeks of silence. During our last meeting, they brought up that they were uninviting me from plans that we had made months prior since we were “just roommates” and I got mad at them. 

I said that we aren’t even “just roommates” and that I know that they don’t treat strangers this poorly, so why are they treating me this poorly? I told them that since they were the one who was making this living situation untenable for me, they should move out. They told me they couldn’t afford it, and I suggested that they stop eating out as much so that they could save up and leave. This resulted in a very heated argument where they told me I infuriated them, was childish, etc etc. 

Am I the asshole for asking them to move out? 

I think I might be the asshole since I know the rental market right now is bad, and moving out isn’t a small thing to do. My suggesting this also clearly upset them a lot.

In this falling out, my roommate had decided the friendship was over several months before telling me/deciding to do anything about it. They gave me the silent treatment for weeks before I decided we needed to have a mediated talk. 

Post our mediated discussion, we agreed that we were not going to be friends, just roommates. But my roommate isn’t even treating me as well as they would a stranger! They don’t say anything to me unless I say something first, and when they do speak it’s just “hi” or “good morning” or during our weekly roommate meetings where we discuss chores/household matters. 

Recently, they’ve even been leaving the room when I come in. They don’t say anything, they just get up and go to their room. They glare at me. I find this extremely hurtful, especially in the wake of their weeks of silence. During our last meeting, they brought up that they were uninviting me from plans that we had made months prior since we were “just roommates” and I got mad at them. 

I said that we aren’t even “just roommates” and that I know that they don’t treat strangers this poorly, so why are they treating me this poorly? I told them that since they were the one who was making this living situation untenable for me, they should move out. They told me they couldn’t afford it, and I suggested that they stop eating out as much so that they could save up and leave. This resulted in a very heated argument where they told me I infuriated them, was childish, etc etc. 

Am I the asshole for asking them to move out? 

I think I might be the asshole since I know the rental market right now is bad, and moving out isn’t a small thing to do. My suggesting this also clearly upset them a lot. 

tldr: Roommate has been treating me poorly, I asked them to move out. AITA?",1.0,0.03593514859676361,0,0

84,1dxi38e,AITA For Uninviting My Friend To My Wedding After An Argument?,"I (f24) am getting married to my fiancé Micah (m26) in two months. I've been with my fiance for a two years, and other than normal couple arguments, things between us have been relatively good.

My friend Justin (m25) has been one of my best friends since middle school. After graduating highschool, we would always hang out, take small trips together, and Justin has hung out with my fiancé and I many times.

Recently, Justin has been displaying this aggressive, clingy behavior with me. He will constantly try to lean on me or hug me, will constantly insert his own feelings into my personal business, and get upset when I try to set boundaries with him. Justin will get angry and storm off in any direction, and when I try to talk about it he will dismiss the situation.

The most recent incident is when I told Justin I would be meeting with my future MIL to talk about wedding plans. Justin started making ""evil MIL jokes"" to me about it, which made me feel incredibly weird, because my MIL has always been incredibly kind to me. While I know these were just jokes, there's several jokes that he has made (whether it be about my fiancé, me, or my extended family) that just confuse and shock me.

Two weeks ago after speaking to a friend (f23), she said I would have to talk to Justin about his behavior. When I did, I was incredibly angry and went off a bunch, telling him over and over how uncomfortable he's made me in the past few months and that I cannot stand to be around him. I can't stand his touchy behavior and his lack of understanding. He got upset and began to bring up that I've been taking things too seriously lately, and instead of playfully joking around with him like I used to, I will take what he says literally and it makes it awkward for him. I got even more upset and revoked his invite to the wedding.

I feel like I'm the asshole for being too serious and upset over the situation. I haven't spoken to anyone about this interaction, and Justin hasn't spoken to me ever since.

So i just graduated recently and I have been attending a lot of grad parties for my friends. Last night I was at a grad party until late into the night and was staying for a fire. My girlfriend asked me a little earlier on in the evening if I wanted to go do something her that night. Now me and my girlfriend live a decent drive away (about 30-40 mins) and at the time I told her no and that I wanted to stay at the grad party because we were gonna be doing things later into the night and I would miss the event that she had invited me to. So a little later into the night I find out from the group of my friends also at the grad party that after the grad party they are going out to do something and they invited me to come. This event that they invited me to was about a 15 minute drive away and it is also one of the last chances I will some of these friends again because some are moving out of state and some are just going to colleges far away so I told them yes. I informed my girlfriend of the new plans and she got very upset. She said that I am selfish and inconsiderate for telling her no and then agreeing to plans with other people. I tried explaining to her that I get why she was upset but it would be the last time that all my friends would be gathered like this and the event and it was an easier event to go to and it was closer. She continued to say that she was  very angry and upset still and that she thinks that I have no right to make plans with other people after I told her I wouldn’t hang out with her. I then tried to make a solution and said we can go do this thing some other time and I will make time for it. She said she didn’t want to hear it and then when I went back to the party continued to blow up my phone with mean messages and calls. She then blocked my number and ignored all my texts for the rest of the night.

She's a single mom and often drops Sam and Tom off at my place so that I can keep on eye on them while she runs errands or goes to work. Sometimes she will do this with no notice. I also work but I am self-employed in a position where I can take the kids to work with me.

I don't mind too much because I like seeing them and my nephews are at an age where they don't require tons of supervision.

If Sam and Tom have been dropped off with me with no notice and I have plans, I will just take them with me wherever I'm going. Last weekend, my sister left the kids with me with no notice and said she picked up a shift at the last minute.

On that day I had plans to go to a fundraiser at the Church so I took my nephews with me to that. I should mention that although I'm Christian, my sister is not and we have pretty different values.

At the event, Sam and Tom were playing with some other kids. Sam and an 8 year old boy had a disagreement over the rules of a game they were playing, and Sam started cussing (a lot) and loudly called the boy names.

I was pretty embarrassed and took Sam to one side and I told him off. I said that he shouldn't use that kind of language at a Church setting and especially towards a kid younger than him. He said sorry to the boy and I apologized to his parents. I was pretty stern with Sam but I got the point across and he seemed to listen.

Later in private I told my sister what happened and she was pretty mad to say the least. She explained that Sam has been going through a phase of copying the language he hears in video games. She said that I'm pushing my values onto her kids and I don't get to scold Sam for how he speaks and its up to her as a parent if it's acceptable or not.

As for now, I’m not earning any money (still  broke student lmao) but I do use my monthly allowance for my mom’s and boyfriend’s birthday. But, I never do anything for my father. 

When the Covid happened, my dad got stuck in the country he was working and living. We didn’t meet for almost 2 years. When he was coming back, I bought a new year cheesecake and few t-shirts (it’s cheap but still good quality, i’ve been using the same t-shirts as home wear for 2 years) to surprise him for his arrival for our home visit. 

Of course, he got surprised. But, something he said hurt me. He said it’s not his favourite cake.  He said he owns and buys much more expensive t-shirts than these and he wouldn’t wear these. Even though he said he didn’t like cheesecake, he is the one who ate the most of it. I don’t know, he said it in a funny tone but I feel like disregarded my efforts completely. 

For his 49th birthday, he still complained about the cake and gifts too. During taking photos and singing happy birthday, he looks so unhappy and dissatisfied with whatever I do. The following year, he kept saying no need to celebrate his 50th birthday as everyone will know that he’s 50. I always had plans for my parent’s 50th birthday. He was quite harsh and rude about not wanting to celebrate his 50th birthday and so I obeyed. 

For this 50th birthday, I wished him but I didn’t make any efforts for his birthday. No cake, no gifts. And then, he still complained. For my birthday, he bought a cake and before i cut the cake, he was like “even though you didn’t do anything for my 50th birthday, i still do something for you”. He felt like 50th birthday is a huge deal and I didn’t care about it. I did tell him that HE SAID HE DONT WANT TO CELEBRATE. He was gaslighting me saying he said no such thing. 

He’s been saying this to his side of the family. Like, I don’t care about his birthday and he had a such sad birthday because his kids didn’t care about him. Like he’s a such lonely person because we didn’t do anything. Everyone from his side of the family is looking at me like I don’t care about my father. He didn’t say to them that he didn’t want a birthday party. I feel embarrassed and humiliated because he’s damaging my image. Am I the asshole for not celebrating my father’s birthday?

So my mom and I have a very butt head relationship and she likes to make me feel bad for a lot of stuff I’ve done or don’t do. Im 28, she’s 47 and my dad is 63. They never liked what I did growing up and I’ve always been very independent and they disliked almost anything I tried to do that didnt involve being around them/talking to them. When I moved states they weren’t happy about it and my dad was mad at me for not sending him my new address right away and after would never responded to any texts I sent.

I avoid talking to her and my dad bc either the conversation is negative or there really isn’t much to talk about so there’s no point (to me anyway, and my mom during calls either just bitches about work or someone else or would somehow throw something negative at me.) and I prefer to text anyway because I can at least answer and chat on my own time without interrupting what I’m doing.

She texted me today after about a week and a half of not talking/texting, saying she had a dream I was crying and was making sure I’m ok and she sent me some videos of a little squirrel in the backyard where they live (we live in different states now) and I texted her saying I was ok and how I went to see a fireworks show and sent her some pics. She liked them and then told me she is glad I’m ok and that she hopes I have a good day, and that she loves me no matter what and I said the same, I told her I’m sorry for not being as chatty (I work at a call center so I’m on phones all day) and I told her I’m always here, she can just text me whenever.
She then suddenly went “forget it. I don’t want to text, I can’t believe you have no time to just call me. I don’t understand why you do this to me and your father. Bye.” 

I honestly am tired of when she does this and she wonders why I don’t like to talk to her. Even not long after I didn’t respond to her she texted saying “so you’re not going to call me, huh.”

96,1dxg7b3,AITA for not transferring my roommate the full utility bill?,"My (21 F) roommate (22 F) is an absolute nightmare. Almost every “bad roommate” thing possible describes her. She’s loud at all times, filthy, doesn’t pay rent properly, has caused damage to the property, and constantly has either her mom or boyfriend over.

Over the eight months of living together, I have attempted to talk to her many times about all of this, and suggest ways to resolve the conflicts. She claimed it was harassment, and then decided that I’m only allowed to contact her via email, or she will go to police.

A few weeks ago, without informing me, she decided to adjust how much she would like to pay for the rent, against how we had been paying the last eight months. I only found out about this after receiving an angry text from our landlord saying we were short. I immediately paid what my roommate hadn’t. 

Her boyfriend stays with us 3-5 nights a week. He showers, does washing, and is often here when she isn’t. He is filthy, and leaves messes in the bathroom and is constantly playing loud trap music at any hour. I’m fairly certain he is unemployed as he is constantly here during the day, even on weekdays, as I go home for my lunch hour and always just find him here by himself.

The utility bill is completely in her name, and my name is not associated with it at all. This last couple of months it has been insanely high, almost twice as what it is usually, likely because of how often her boyfriend is here. The last month I tried to talk to her about it and she ignored me and simply told me to pay my half, which I did. This month however, when the bill was even higher than last, and when she hadn’t paid her rent properly and her boyfriend had been here more than half of the days and nights of the month, I decided not to. I sent her an email explaining that I wasn’t paying the full half this month, and explained why, and then sent a fair amount. 

She claimed that I legally needed to transfer her the entire half, which I replied that I did not as the bill was in her name, and I had given her the valid reasons as to why she wasn’t receiving half. She told me she was going to take me to the disputes court. I told her that it would not be a good idea for her to do that, as she was breaking multiple clauses in her tenancy agreement that I have plenty of evidence of. I told her we should discuss how we operate things and write up a roommate agreement in which she responded “no I’m not doing anything wrong, you legally need to pay me” and claims she’s going to lawyers.

97,1dxfygg,"WIBTA for telling my brother, I would rather GF wasn't at my birthday dinner?","Sorry in advance, joined reddit just to ask this question so the style might not be right.

So, AITA for not wanting my brothers(23), GF(19) of over two years coming over for my (female, 26) birthday.

So background;

First I do get on well with his gf, she is a lovely girl and went thought a lot of rough times last year so I have respect for my brother being there for her and happy for him if he's happy. But any birthday we've had we always have a few drinks and family night. It's been tradition for as long as I can remember. We all have 1 or 2 drinks, some food, have a good time, but his gf gets over the top, throwing up, drunk every single time and it gets annoying, birthdays, xmas, new years, every single time she will take it too far and she likes to throw it in my face that she smarter than me. Which is fine, cool I have my degree, I've never really cared about that thing but my bf (age 29) has been taking a year off school due to having to resit exams.

My birthday this year is different, I'm finally introducing my family to the BF of 3 years. I live out of town so I'm not home all that often to get them to meet, and truthfully I'm nervous, my bf knows me a lot better than my parents, I moved away for a reason, my relationship with my parents is a lot better now I have. But the idea of my two separate life's merging is scary and nerve wracking, I want it to go well.

I already get really anxious and nervous with a lot of thing with my parents, so I really just wanted it to be us 5 and my BF. I really don't want the added pressure of her being there as well. But I think my issue is with my brother not asking if it was okay if she come to dinner with us. I only know because my younger sister (age 15) told me, neither of parents have asked either.

I'm more upset every adult in this situation knew she was coming without having asked and no one bothered to tell me until my sister.

I don't know if it is childish, like its one extra person grow up, but then this is such a big moment for me I really wanted it to be family only, that is what we had talked about that was the original, but now my brother has changed that plan and not even told me, it just brings back a lot of memories of the disrespect from my childhood.

So would I be the A hole if I message my brother telling him, I'm uncomfortable with her being there when my parents meet my BF? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-07,"WIBTA for telling my brother, I would rather GF wasn't at my birthday dinner? Sorry in advance, joined reddit just to ask this question so the style might not be right.

So, AITA for not wanting my brothers(23), GF(19) of over two years coming over for my (female, 26) birthday.

So background;

First I do get on well with his gf, she is a lovely girl and went thought a lot of rough times last year so I have respect for my brother being there for her and happy for him if he's happy. But any birthday we've had we always have a few drinks and family night. It's been tradition for as long as I can remember. We all have 1 or 2 drinks, some food, have a good time, but his gf gets over the top, throwing up, drunk every single time and it gets annoying, birthdays, xmas, new years, every single time she will take it too far and she likes to throw it in my face that she smarter than me. Which is fine, cool I have my degree, I've never really cared about that thing but my bf (age 29) has been taking a year off school due to having to resit exams.

My birthday this year is different, I'm finally introducing my family to the BF of 3 years. I live out of town so I'm not home all that often to get them to meet, and truthfully I'm nervous, my bf knows me a lot better than my parents, I moved away for a reason, my relationship with my parents is a lot better now I have. But the idea of my two separate life's merging is scary and nerve wracking, I want it to go well.

I already get really anxious and nervous with a lot of thing with my parents, so I really just wanted it to be us 5 and my BF. I really don't want the added pressure of her being there as well. But I think my issue is with my brother not asking if it was okay if she come to dinner with us. I only know because my younger sister (age 15) told me, neither of parents have asked either.

I'm more upset every adult in this situation knew she was coming without having asked and no one bothered to tell me until my sister.

I don't know if it is childish, like its one extra person grow up, but then this is such a big moment for me I really wanted it to be family only, that is what we had talked about that was the original, but now my brother has changed that plan and not even told me, it just brings back a lot of memories of the disrespect from my childhood.

102,1dxfo0q,AITA for knocking on a neighbor's door and expecting an answer?,"A few days ago, I realized recently that I didn't get a package I was expecting. I checked the tracking information and saw that it had been delivered a week ago, to the person with my apartment number in the other building in my apartment complex. 

So I went over to the other building at around 6pm, ensured I was at the right place using the photo taken by the delivery person, and knocked on the door. No answer. That's fine, I figured, they must be out, so I decided to come back the next day. 

The next day, there's still no answer. Then on the third day, I can hear the television inside the apartment. Aha! So I knock on the door and... nothing. No response. I wait a few minutes, then knock on the door again. I figure maybe they were in the middle of something, or not appropriately dressed to answer the door. Still no answer. I wait a few minutes and knock again. This goes on for maybe 10 minutes or so. Admittedly, at this point I was already peeved from being completely ignored, and also having had to spend several days on this. 

So about the fourth or fifth time knocking on the door, I suddenly hear a woman screaming at me from inside, ""IF YOU TOUCH MY FUCKING DOOR AGAIN, I'M CALLING 911.""

I try to explain that I had a package delivered to her apartment, to which she screamed, ""I NEVER GOT YOUR FUCKING PACKAGE! NOW LEAVE, OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE!!"" I told her I had a photo of the package delivered to her door. She paused, then went back to screaming that I was scaring her, and that she was calling the police. I told her fine, go ahead, tell them a neighbor is knocking on her door looking for a package and see what 911 has to say about that. I left and went to the office and explained the situation.

The office emailed her, along with my photo of the package, at which point she said she did get the package, but had her boyfriend place it in the mailroom right outside their elevator. (This is not where packages go, as it's unsecured: there's a package room maybe 50 feet away he could have delivered it to instead, or dropped it off with the office about 75 feet away.) Unsurprisingly, my package was gone by this point, having either been stolen or discarded.

So my question is: am I the asshole for knocking and expecting an answer? I wouldn't necessarily expect her to open the door, but to at least say hello and ask me why I was knocking? I thought about leaving a note, but I have some wrist pain that makes writing difficult, and I don't own a printer. 

I try to be respectful of the fact that women can feel threatened by men. If I'm walking late at night, I'll make a point of not following behind a woman, of veering around a woman walking the other way to give her as much space as possible, etc. I do see how a man knocking on her door could be intimidating, even though I'm not intimidating as men go. 

Should I have given up after the first or second knock? Did I do something wrong by expecting a reply when I can hear someone watching TV?

So we broke up 3 weeks before I went on a birthday trip with my friends. But we were still seeing each other and calling etc. Pretty similar to how we were during our relationship but minus a few things. He broke up with me and he wanted to continue hanging out and I was fine with that, but made it clear I wouldn't get back with him because we're not compatible. 
I told him before I left that I wouldn't be talking to him much while I'm on this trip because I'll be seeing my friends after a long time and I'm on vacation. And we're not even together anymore. 

At midnight on my birthday he called to wish me, I spoke to him for ~10 minutes then went to bed. The morning I called him back and we spoke for another 15 minutes while my one of friends was in the room. Then we went out and had a great day. Came back  and texted him I was tired and going to sleep. And he asked if I couldn't take 5 minutes to talk to him. So I did. 

Next day, no word from him. I was thinking if I should text him good morning but then I made it clear it's something I won't be doing since we're not together anymore so I didn't. Instead I snapped and sent pictures of my day etc. No replies. Said he was not feeling well and sleeping early so I left him alone.

Next day evening I called him and he exploded....

Because I didn't talk to him for longer on my birthday and when I did call him in the morning my friend was there. And he gave me so much time on his birthday and on other trips where he actually had the time to spare. 
When I said that expectation didn't make sense to me since we're broken up and I'm on a trip.  He accused me of being selfish and toxic and said he's never going to speak to me again. 

That was nearly 2 months ago and he still hasn't. And I haven't contacted him either because I feel like I didn't really do anything wrong.

So, my in-laws have wanted to go on vacation with my husband, me and our kids ever since our first child (10) was born. I was always against going together, while my husband felt indifferent towards it but supported me in my wishes. His parents are nice people, but they do like to control everyone around them and a vacation with them just would not feel like a vacation at all.

Last week, my husband and I decided to change our plans. It's still three weeks until our vacation. We felt a bit bad about the hotel we had booked initially but it is very popular and as far as I know,  
they already had a waiting list anyway. So far, so good.

Yesterday, my in-laws were at our place and when we told them about our new plans, they blew up. Apparently, they had wanted to surprise us and have booked the same week at the same hotel. The don't like the hotel or the destination, but they finally wanted an opportunity to go on a family vacation with us. They also haven't gotten any insurance, so if they cancel now, they will still be charged about half the price.

They are not poor, but they are both retired and losing this kind of money will hurt. They don't plan on going without us. Of course, my husband's side of the family is now mad at us and blame us for everything. Choosing such an expensive hotel, changing our plans and also for not agreeing on going on vacation with my in-laws in the first place. They say, we basically ""forced"" them to be sneaky about it.

Here's why I think I may be the AH:   
My husband wants to reimburse them. Admittedly, we could afford it, but I still don't want to. I say they need to learn their lesson, or we will be dealing with this scenario every year from now on. However, my husband's siblings say I am the AH, because in the end, my husband will be suffering. Knowing my in-laws, they will hold this against us for years to come and it will be an uncomfortable topic on every family event.

My husband wants to reimburse them. Admittedly, we could afford it, but I still don't want to. I say they need to learn their lesson, or we will be dealing with this scenario every year from now on. However, my husband's siblings say I am the AH, because in the end, my husband will be suffering. Knowing my in-laws, they will hold this against us for years to come and it will be an uncomfortable topic on every family event. I've learned to ignore them, but my husband has been conditioned to cater to their needs and feel guilty if he doesn't.

107,1dxep11,AITA for not inviting my brothers new girlfriend to my wedding,"My (28F) wedding is coming up in two months, and my fiancé (30M) and I have been meticulously planning every detail for over a year. It’s a small, intimate ceremony with close friends and family, totaling around 50 guests.

A few weeks ago, my brother (26M) started dating someone new, “Lily” (25F). They’ve been together for about a month, and while she seems nice enough, I barely know her. My brother called me last week and asked if he could bring Lily to the wedding. He said she’s really important to him and he’d like her to be there.

I hesitated and told him I’d think about it. The truth is, I’m not comfortable inviting someone I’ve only met twice to such an intimate event. Plus, we’re already at our limit for guests, and adding one more person would mean having to cut someone else or make other logistical changes.

When I told my brother my concerns, he got really upset. He accused me of not supporting his relationship and said I was being unreasonable. He even hinted that he might not come to the wedding if Lily isn’t invited, which hurt a lot.

My fiancé thinks we should stick to our original plan and not make exceptions, especially since it’s so close to the wedding date. But now I’m second-guessing myself. I don’t want to hurt my brother or cause a rift in our family, but I also want my wedding day to be as we envisioned it.

109,1dxe1pq,AITA: Not understanding my new  friend's social cues. ,"Hello, I am a 21yo student and I would say I'm pretty introverted, I mostly have online friends and don't have a girlfriend or anything nor had I one. Last year I moved to a shared appartment with 2 others. In September one moved out and a new guy moved in, I'll call him Johnny. He is 6 years older than I am, active in gym, extremely extroverted and from the gym also meets a lot of friends.

Johnny has more of a carpe diem mindset with one night stands etc. He brags about his body count and how many girls he is pulling. Meanwhile I am still quite conservative, I stepped out of Islam a few years ago but I don't active do the extreme opposites of how I used to behave, namely in the context of relationships and sex, sometimes I'm even doubting if I am asexual.
I became good friends with him, I think because of him I go out of my shell more. Eg, he convinced me to go to the gym as well. We go on evening or midnight walks, he introduced me to his friend Billy; we did 8-ball pool one evening, and something that I was very uncomfortable with, is we went to the club some time later with the three of us.

This has happened in other occasions, but one that stands out and Johnny brings up sometimes. The evening at the 8-ball pool building. Billy, who has the same mentality about going out with women as Johnny, said during us playing that the female employee at the counter is hot / good looking (I can't remember the words exactly). When we stopped playing, Billy went to the counter to bring back the playing balls, or so I thought. Johnny stayed behind close to the exit and I just walked with Billy to the counter. He gives the balls and pays. 

Later I hear from both of them how I ruined Billy's chances with him talking to the girl. It never came to my mind that is what he wanted to do when handing in the balls. They said that me being there next to him makes it awkward so he couldn't make a move. 

Another time, Johnny and I went to the supermarket and I bought strawberries. We went to the gym directly from the supermarket. I opened one of the strawberries boxes to eat there and gave some to few people I met from the gym. At one point Johnny asks if he can have the box for a second and took it to give to and talk to a woman he has 'in his radar' so to speak. I didn't know that at first. They were talking at a distance and I just went up to him because I just wanted to have a strawberry. Later I hear again that I am making it awkward by interrupting him.

110,1dxe02z,AITA for removing my group members' access to our assignment after they took my name off the cover page?,"Hi everyone,

I need some perspective on a situation with my group project. I've been very active and done most of the work on the assignment from the beginning. I was always working ahead to ensure we could deliver our drafts on time.

However, recently I got into a car accident and was admitted to the hospital. I informed the group chat about this and explained that I wouldn't be able to participate as much in finishing the rest of the assignment. I mentioned that I would help as much as I could but working with a broken wrist and a concussion is really hard. I even apologized for ""abandoning"" them. Out of the three other group members, only one responded to my message.

The next day, I noticed that my name was removed from the cover page of the assignment. I thought this was strange and a bit hurtful, considering my situation.

Here’s what I’m considering: As I am the owner of the OneDrive file, I can remove their access to the document, put my name back on the cover page, and submit the assignment myself (everyone has to submit it individually to get a grade).

AITA for wanting to do this and pay them back for removing my name without any communication?

**EDIT** **for extra info:** The instructor is aware of my situation, but expects us to figure stuff like this out on our own.

I would say I have done about 45% of the whole assignment by myself.

**UPDATE:**

I confronted them about removing my name. The one who removed my name implied I was ""free-riding"". I clarified that I had contributed a large amount to the assignment. They argued that my contributions were not up to standard and had to be redone (I checked, they only redid one paragraph). I expressed that they should have communicated any issues with my work and that removing my name felt wrong. One member said they didn't want to stress me out further by telling me my work wasn't good enough and suggested putting my name back on and moving forward without further discussion.

111,1dxdtlf,AITA for bonding with my mother's dog?,"Last year, I (20F) and my mother (40F) lost both of our dogs (mine at 5 years old in June which was right before my birthday, and she passed away from IVDD. And my mother's at 12 years old before Christmas. We had to put her down due to old age.) So of course, it was really hard to move on from the pain those losses caused and the wounds still have not healed.

My mom would not allow me to get another dog because I was planning on getting a new job at the time and I would not be home as often, so she would be responsible for taking care of it. Which is reasonable. Though I was and still am responsible for cleaning up and taking care of all the dogs we own, even the ones mom has claimed are hers and hers only, since I was 14 years old.

But then mom started looking for a dog for herself. So she finds a puppy, and brings it home right before the anniversary of my dog's death and my birthday. I found it a bit inconsiderate but I let it go because the puppy was pretty cute. Let's call him Bingo.

Well everything was fine until me and the puppy began bonding. See, mom's other dog had a rough past before we got her, and she clung on to mom like glue. But she also had bad aggression because of it issues. She would constantly attack me and my father but absolutely loved my mom. It became a big issues because of how aggressive and spiteful she could get. (Btw she was a Chihuahua but still bit pretty hard.)

But because Bingo is a Chihuahua too and also had a rough past before we got him, she assumed he would be just as aggressive and territorial. Bingo is still a bit of both of those things, but Bingo is nicer and we get along. I didn't even try to bond with him because I didn't want to. I want to move out soon so the last thing I need is to be attached to another animal that I cannot take with me. But it just kind of happened. I can't help that the dog likes me and I like him too.

However, mom has gotten quite possessive of this dog. Because he came over to me to cuddle with me a couple of times yesterday, she accused me of trying to steal her dog, claimed that he loved me more than her now, and told me that I need to distance myself from him, even pinch him when he jumps up on my lap so he will leave.

This isn't the first time she has gotten possessive over animals, but this is the worst I have seen her by far. It just makes me upset because she would always be loving on my dog and I never said a word, but I give her dog some love and she loses it. It's hard because I had to snub him for most of the day and he kept looking over at me with tears in his eyes because he didn't understand. That breaks my heart. 

I understand that she wants to fill the void is in her heart from losing her last dog. I do too and I would if I could right now. But this feels like it has gotten far too out of control. Besides, I have to help take care of him and I don't want to do that with a dog I am not allowed to bond with.

She told mom she can forget about being a part of her life or going to her wedding now, half sister is engaged.

She used to try and break them up in the past. Dad would get so mad and frustrated with her but she never let the dream die and now her dream has come true.

My aunt confronted me afterward and told me I should be making a bigger deal out of it because it looks like I don't care about the weird and over the top reaction from my half sister. She said mom must feel like I don't care about her heartache at all. That it's rough to see a child she loved and helped raise cheer on the fact she's getting divorced from dad.

My aunt, her younger sister, paid for everything. It was my moms wish to be cremated, which is what my aunt had done. My aunt informed me a few months after my moms funeral that she had “something special” planned for moms ashes and she’ll “send them to me when she has the time.” I tried texting her periodically to see if there was an update as to when the “something special” would be done so I could get my portion of the ashes to help with the grieving process. I should note that I am not my mothers only child. She has 3 biological children and 3 biological grandchildren not to mention her mother (my grandma). None of us have received a portion of moms ashes except moms youngest child and one grandchild and that’s because they live with my aunt. I have tried not to text my aunt too much because she works long hours at the hospital and I didn’t want to seem too pushy. But the last time I texted her about my moms ashes was August 31, 2023. It has almost been a year. She has responded to texts I sent her later on, but they weren’t about my moms ashes so I know she is receiving my texts and knows that it is me. What do I do? I don’t want to pester her to the point where you pressed charges for harassment but I can’t move forward with my healing process without my portion. I don’t even want that much. Just enough to fill a small capsule type necklace. Somebody, anybody please give me some advice. 

Oh one more thing I forgot to mention, my mom and her siblings (there were 5 kids total in her family) were not close. Not to mention my grandpa is still alive as well. My mom was the first to pass away. And the only one who has her ashes is my aunt who paid for everything, my sister and niece and my other aunt who paid for a portion.

My aunt, her younger sister, paid for everything. It was my moms wish to be cremated, which is what my aunt had done. My aunt informed me a few months after my moms funeral that she had “something special” planned for moms ashes and she’ll “send them to me when she has the time.” I tried texting her periodically to see if there was an update as to when the “something special” would be done so I could get my portion of the ashes to help with the grieving process. I should note that I am not my mothers only child. She has 3 biological children and 3 biological grandchildren not to mention her mother (my grandma). None of us have received a portion of moms ashes except moms youngest child and one grandchild and that’s because they live with my aunt. I have tried not to text my aunt too much because she works long hours at the hospital and I didn’t want to seem too pushy. But the last time I texted her about my moms ashes was August 31, 2023. It has almost been a year. She has responded to texts I sent her later on, but they weren’t about my moms ashes so I know she is receiving my texts and knows that it is me. What do I do? I don’t want to pester her to the point where you pressed charges for harassment but I can’t move forward with my healing process without my portion. I don’t even want that much. Just enough to fill a small capsule type necklace. Somebody, anybody please give me some advice. 

Oh one more thing I forgot to mention, my mom and her siblings (there were 5 kids total in her family) were not close. Not to mention my grandpa is still alive as well. My mom was the first to pass away. And the only one who has her ashes is my aunt who paid for everything, my sister and niece and my other aunt who paid for a portion. I was never told that I had to pay my aunt or anybody to get a portion but I feel like I should have some. ",0.0,0.14088836312294006,0,1
115,1dxde4k,AITA  for not going away for the weekend with my family? ,"
I 18F am the eldest of 3 and am currently living at home with my parents. I graduated last year and had a massive fall out with my friends from high school following our schoolies trip. I haven’t had a very active social life and haven’t gone out much in the last 6 months unless it’s been with family or my partner. It wasn’t until February when I started uni that I met new people that I would now consider some of my best friends. Outside of uni we have only managed to hang out once, as we live a good 3+ hours away from each other. recently an opportunity popped up when my family told me they were planning on going to a country town for the annual field day. This is something that we haven’t been to in 5 years due to covid and other things, meaning I was 13 and 14 the last time we went. This field day is something that I’ve never enjoyed and previously had no choice but to do. since turning 18 I’ve been told that I don’t have to attend family holidays or outings and even thanked on occasion for when I do. I regularly spend weekends at home or out to dinner with my family, while my 17 year old sister goes out to parties and gathos. I haven’t missed any major holidays or outings since I’ve turned 18 and had the opportunity of doing so. this is the first and only time I have ever said that I don’t want to go on a family trip. When I first voiced this a month ago I was told that that was fine. But now that it’s less than a week away from this trip I am being told that this is the last opportunity for us to do this as a family of 5. this is the same argument I was told back in Easter when I had an assessment due and asked if I could stay behind while they went away. 

Tonight when I asked for that I think is the  5 time over the last month, if I was able to have my friend over while they were away, I was met with the previous argument that this was the last time we would be doing something as a family and told that I was being selfish because this is important to my dad that I go. Previously I would just give in and go but I’m kind of over being told that I don’t act like an adult but not given the chance to do adult things. 

It feels like I’m being guilt tripped into going even though it’s the last thing I want to do. it’s not even about me having a friend over either - it’s because I’m saying I don’t want to go. 

Now they’re saying I can’t stay at home if I don’t go and need to find somewhere else to stay while they’re away.

My sister showed initial interest in the gift but became bored of it after a while, while I continued to use the gift for many years. 

Throughout the years I have maintained the gift and kept it at good quality as it fell into my sole possession for caring purposes. 
Recently my sister had found out that the gift was a collectible item that she could sell for a quick cash grab. I decided against selling it and she let it go for a while.

A little while back, the high price of the gift was brought up again and I vehemently denied that we should sell it as I have strong emotional and sentimental attachment to the gift,  as I maintained it and gained inspiration from it for art purposes. My sister claims that it isn’t fair that I hold onto it for these reasons and feels that she should be allowed to sell it because she loves money and that she deserves the money, despite us both having equal ownership. 

I still denied the sale and told her that I stand by what I said and told her that she only shows interest in it when it has a cash value and she couldn’t  care less for it. She doesn’t want to sell it due to any financial emergency, but rather due to her wanting money.

My sister thinks I’m being selfish for wanting to keep it, but didn’t make any promises to share the cash value from the gift if she sold it.
While I could sell this item it would continue to go up in price as the years progress and I would end up buying the gift back at a loss to myself, and while I don’t care for the cash value, buying it again wouldn’t hold the same emotional value as when it was gifted all those years ago.

We call my mom grandma but she died a couple of decades ago and the kids never met her. But we still talk about her and they know about her. My dad is grandpa and his wife insisted she was going to be grandma and not grandma name. My dad fought hard for his wife to not have her name added like the other stepgrandparents.

I asked this because I was tired: I worked 6 shifts this week, Monday til Saturday. all 9 or 10 hours long. And same goes for last week. And after every shift, I still tried to spend my evenings with him, before going home and working again in the morning.
I told him that I know I haven’t seen him for full days lately, but that every time I was free, I spent that time on him. So on this free day, I wanted some alone time and time to relax without interaction with people.

He agreed and said “Yes we can meet later than 12:30 today. But how about 1 instead of 4?”. I told him no, I really need some hours to myself. He said “Ok, 2 then?”. Again I said no. He then said “Okay, 3 then. It has to be 3.”.
I told him “No, I said four and Im tired, I worked 60 hours this week and I have spent every other hour on spending time with u, I don’t owe u anything. It would be nice if you could understand this and grant me some time to myself.”.

He then got upset and said “U dont see me using my work as an excuse”. This man works 2 shifts a week, and both are 3 hours. I told him I didn’t wanna see him at all anymore today.

Over 3 years ago, my adult son, daughter-in-law and my 3 grandsons, were being evicted from their apartment by DIL’s father, for not paying their rent and keeping their place clean.  (The apartment was owned by DIL’s recently deceased Grandmother)  Son came to me and asked if they could move in with me until they could get on their feet.  I was very reluctant to do so, as my son and I have had issues in the past with his anger, and we can’t seem to have a conversation that doesn’t end up with him screaming in my face, but I felt bad for my grandkids and said they could move in, but with some rules.  They had to pay rent, they were NOT to have food or drink in their rooms, and they had to clean up after themselves. They were to pay rent of $600/mo., and I was ok with receiving half on the 1st and half on the 15th if it would be easier for them.  Then, just before moving in (and without asking first) they got a dog.  My son has had and quit so many jobs during the past 3 years that I can’t even count.  In January of 2023, he got fired again, and decided he wanted to try and work for himself.  He was a plumber by trade.  So, he wasn’t paying any rent during this time, but he has been doing work here and there.  He has also been hired at a couple of different places since then, when he realized he needed a steady income, but continued to not pay any rent.  As of today he has only paid rent for 2 months out of the last 17 months!  And to top it off, I lost my job of 11 years in February of this year.  And needless to say, I have gone through all of my savings while being the only one who is paying the bills.  All of my utility bills have tripled since they have moved in, and they are very much aware that I can no longer continue to provide for them without some help, and I frankly don’t think I OWE them anything!  So, I have asked them to find another place to live by the end of the month.  I also expect them to repair some damages they have done to my home, like ruining carpet in both of their bedrooms, (from having food & drinks in their bedroom),replacing the screen in the boys bedroom, since one of them cut a big hole in it, and replacing the screen on my back door that their dog shredded.  Oh, and my DIL works at her kids school, but her money pays for their car insurance, her phone and her weed and cigarette vape.

128,1dxbl5k,AITA for lying to my ex to protect someone?,"Some background: I am a mostly out bisexual guy, and my ex knew about my sexuality. Anyway, to begin, about 2 years ago, I dated a guy who was in the closet.

I also referred to me telling someone a secret about him that I forgot I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, referring to his sexuality (I did not tell her what the secret was about.)

129,1dxbifp,AITA for confronting my friend about excluding me from her birthday party?,"Throwaway bc I don’t have Reddit.

I (21F) have been best friends with Elana (20F) since we instantly connected in middle school. We went to different universities after graduating bc I chose to commute and she went out of state, but we still very close. 

Next Thursday is Elana’s birthday, so I was talking to her to get an idea of her plans so we could hang out. We always spend our birthdays with our families, but we usually try to see each other the day after and have a small celebration with just the two of us. She then tells me that she’s going to be busy not only on Thursday but Friday as well. When I asked her why, she said that it was bc she was having a birthday party with her college friends to celebrate that she’s turning 21 and they’re all going to go clubbing. For context, I am Muslim and that is haram. I never liked that Elana drank and partied. She honestly does a lot of things that go against my faith but I can see that she is a good person so I try to understand. Elana said that we could hang out on Saturday or Sunday instead, and I said okay, but deep down I wasn’t happy. 

I called her last night to tell her how hurt I was to be excluded from celebrating her birthday and for breaking our tradition. I also called her out for caring about her new friends more than me. Elana sounded shocked and said that it was never to hurt me, and that her college friends were all traveling to come visit her for the day after her birthday and she couldn’t say no. She said she wanted to go clubbing and drinking and that she knew I wouldn’t be okay with going since both are haram, so we could hang out over the weekend. Bc I work on Fridays, she did not want me to feel pressured to switch out with someone else bc she knows I’m shy around my coworkers. She also said that she knows Fridays are important Islamically so she figured I’d want to be home instead. This made me mad bc it just sounded like a bunch of excuses and like she didn’t care about me anymore bc I can’t fit in her lifestyle. She said that it’s not like that but that she just wanted to have fun and that she knows I can’t have fun this way so we can hang out over the weekend when it’s easier for the both of us but honestly I don’t believe her. She confessed to being hesitant to tell me bc she didn’t want to upset me and that just made me angrier. Her idea of fun with friends should not exclude me. She’s always been respectful of when I have to pray and what I can and cannot eat (we only go to halal spots when we hang out) so to see her so obviously exclude me makes me wonder if it was all a facade. She said I was misconstruing her words and phrasing it like that made me an AH, but I think the fact that she values drinking and partying more than me hurts, especially since she knows it’s against my religion and I thought she respected me more than that.

My(16F) brother (26m) is currently living with us at home again for personal reasons that aren't relevant to the story. Since then our realtionship is becoming more and more strained. He serverly under validates my OCD and anxiety. In his mind I am overreacting and he can ""cure"" me. This is sm he has said on multiple occasions. One time he moved my bag when I wasn't home, which isn't that bad, I usally understand, perform my ""ritual"" and become a little stressed but I never take it out on the person, or atleast I try not to cause I know sometimes I can be a lot to deal with. But the thing that I had a problem with is he then made sure to tell me about it like ""haha I touched ur bag"" repeating it over and over to me making sure I knew and continued to laugh as I cried from how much stress it was putting on me. He then on a separate occasion told me he touched my bag even when he didn't just to get a reaction from me. Which even though rationally I know he didn't do anything it really messed with my brain and Ik if people on this thread have OCD they may get what I mean but it is hard to explain. As stated previously I have a weird thing with mouth germs so I have bought my own mugs with my own money that I ask people not to use. I later found out he has used them on multiple occasions and when I told him to stop. He said that I was overreacting, he could cure me, and I was distracting him with my OCD. He also constantly flicks me even though he knows it triggers my OCD and anytime I call him out on it he pretends he didn't do anything and tells me I am overreacting.

Now don't hate on my mom please cause she has a lot going on and sometimes does defend me.

132,1dxb4bm,AITA for telling my dad's mistress and now wife that she's disgusting and repulsive to try and use a kid to her advantage during her affair?,"My dad had an affair with my mom's supposed best friend Cheryl. Three years ago Cheryl pulled me (15m) aside and told me about the affair and that she wanted my help to make my siblings still love her when they found out. She was someone we were all close with. I'm the baby of the family and the ""favorite"" of everyone, which I don't see as true, but it's a bit of a joke and I am the baby so I do get people looking out for me more. This is something Cheryl tried to use to her advantage. She put me in the worst position by telling me about the affair because she hoped my siblings would love me too much to hate her if I told them not to. I was so angry at her and at dad. I didn't want to be the one to tell mom. I didn't want to see her break down. But I knew I needed to. Mom was furious, more at Cheryl for involving me than the affair at first. My dad defended Cheryl and said she had known me my whole life and should be allowed to confide in me. It turned into a really big fight. My siblings hated them more for trying to involve me too.

During the divorce we all said we wanted to stay with mom. The judge ruled I had to go to my dad's until I was 14. So for two years I had to go to dad's house every other week. I made it my mission to make life harder for them that whole time. I refused to go along with the happy family shit they tried to pull. Which only got WAY worse when Cheryl was pregnant and they wanted to do a pregnancy reveal with me in it and I said no. After the baby was born they thought I would soften and would want to know their baby, I didn't. The last time I was at their house Cheryl was pregnant again.

I turned 14 and stopped going. I refuse to answer texts from them either (can't block my dad until I turn 18). My siblings have them both blocked and they refuse to engage with them. Cheryl and my dad's families are living closer to them now and both ask about us and why we're not around. Dad's family have tried to reach out and get me to reconcile but I told them it would not happen and I hate my dad.

Cheryl confronted me while I was at the mall the other day. She followed me into different stores and said I have two younger siblings I should know and that I loved her before so I should stop punishing her and dad and start being more respectful. I had enough when I realized she wasn't going to walk away and I told her she's disgusting and repulsive for trying to use me to her advantage, a 12 year old kid, when she was having an affair with dad. I told her I would never show her any respect and she and dad could explain to their kids why they'll never be part of mine or my siblings lives. But I'm not going to let them guilt me into anything.

She has used dad's phone a bunch since then and I got over 100 texts already. Mom told them to stop and bullying a child after all they did makes them look even worse. The response back was I'm a disrespectful child who should be taught better.

When we met, we were both into partying and drinking, and he still is, very much so. 
My interests have shifted quite a bit over the past years: I now prefer meeting my friends sober, I read a ton of books and I try to take good care of my body and mental health by eating right and working out. This also means getting enough sleep. 

Me and my partner have had some intense discussions about that whole partying and going out issue. I had to come to terms that he still very much wants to keep going (although he does so significantly less), he had to accept that I only join him every so often and, while doing so, am staying sober. We‘ve had some great times together but my choice seems to tick off a lot of people, especially his friends. 

He has A TON of friends (a lot of them who are women) who love to go out and party with him. I think my choice to stay home/being sober has naturally led to him doing the same more often too. 
He‘s always made it clear that our relationship is his priority number one, so partying has taken a back seat. I‘ve always felt like some women in his circle are kinda… resentful about that? So I prefer to let him do his thing with them, I don’t find them particulary friendly. 

Some of these women also happen to work with us. Every year, there‘s a party at work where they just go WILD. And I mean cheating-on-their-partners-wild. I find that soooo uncomfortable, so I‘ve never ever gone there. My boyfriend still goes, as do others of our common friend group and I don‘t mind, as I trust him completely. 

Last week there was another party where my boyfriend was approached by one of our colleagues, an older woman. She asked him why we even were together, singe he loves to drink and party and I don’t. Mind you, she‘s 50 and that‘s how her mind works. When he told me, I snapped. I wrote her a message where I kindly suggested that we could meet over a glass of milk and discuss all of her concerns and questions. I also asked her to provide me her husband‘s number since I‘m just as curious as her and would like to know what he sees in her. 
She hasn‘t replied. 

When I showed my boyfriend he got very angry. He told me that I was being too extreme, that she didn’t mean it like that (because: alcohol), that I‘ve made a fool of him and myself and that „this is the reason why these people don‘t like you“.

134,1dxag57,AITA for thinking my best friend should leave their boyfriend ,"AITA for being brutal about telling my best friend they should leave their boyfriend?

Within the last couple of days, my best friend of five  years (we’ll call them Lily 'F 22' ) has been questioning their relationship. Usually, we do our best to be impartial but emotionally intelligent whenever discussing something as intimate as relationship issues together. HOWEVER, this is definitely at the point where i feel like it’s a part of my responsibility as someone who loves and cares for my closest friend’s well being.

Lily made this reddit post yesterday in a public forum  i’ll let you read about it for yourself before I give my perspective on some of the issues not presented. I received full consent from them before posting any of this as it will have very sensitive and vulnerable content attached including SA. It only gets worse the further you read, unfortunately. 

TDLR: Lily flew out of state for the funeral of their grandmother and on the night of the viewing, Joe (Lily’s boyfriend of over five years 'M 24' ) spent the night partying with friends and a girl they had both met twice before. Joe and the girl (Brittany) called and texted Lily before the party had gotten anywhere concerning saying things like “Hey I was just thinking of you , I'm here with [Joe] and I F****** MISS YOU but he misses you too of course"" ""I HATE HOW MUCH I MISS YOU"" ""CALL me"". He then received plenty of phone calls and and text messages from Lily who had woken up very anxious in the middle of the night and checked life360 to see Joe had been at brittanys house for several hours. One of the calls woke him up but he didnt answer, instead, he grabbed his stuff and drove all the way home before calling LIly back (mid funeral, i might add). He then hid it from Lily until they finally asked “did anything happen between you and brittany” where he broke down and said that he “offered her a ride home, went inside, kissed, and fell asleep on the couch”.

Now that you have some sense of understanding, I think my own perspective is going to shed some light into some situations that are being glazed over. My best friend is extremely understanding and far too forgiving. I think they are letting a combination of their empathy and the love that they have for joe allow them to either justify or “forgive and forget” some pretty serious situations. 

First, joe would masturbate to instagram and onlyfans content of Lily’s closest friends. When i learned this from Lily, I immediately blocked joe even against Lily expressing I didn't need to. Clearly it was concerning to me that they would tell me such given how devastating it must be to have the love of your life explore sexual gratification from people Lily really wanted to keep in their life. 

There was also a situation where Lily had someone reach out to them from a private account on instagram with the classic “hey girly” message. In which, they detailed matching with Joe on tinder during their relationship. I believe that one was justified by him with saying he never talked to anyone and that it was meant to be for them both to look for a third (a very new idea that was introduced very recent to that moment with no thought out or communicated plan of execution). 

He has also openly expressed TO LILY that he's kept certain women around because of the idea that he wants to “develop a sexual relationship”. This is much more recent in the timeline of the relationship as this happened in the last several months and the tinder account was around their first year anniversary. 

Around their three year mark, and sttarting off the most unsavory and brutal part of this story to write, Joe had taken a work opportunity that required him to travel to New York for a summer. During this trip, he managed to find his way back on tinder… and in some girls apartment. The story goes that he met up with her, they made out, and he fondled her chest before being OVERCOME with grief and shame causing him to leave before he “took it too far”. Joe managed to hide this from Lily for something close to an entire year before blurting it out on a drunk whim. Lily happened to be communicating that they wouldnt want to know if something like that had ever happened before and he blurted it out. Followed up by what makes this truly one of the worst things ive ever heard someone tell a person theyre supposed to love…

“I did it because i wanted you to know how it felt when i learned about when you were raped”

I truly cannot imagine the utter devastation that caused for Lily. i only know how completely shocked and angry i was that someone could say that to the person theyre supposed to love with everything they are. I can only speculate how much shame that created for Lily… being blamed not only for someone betraying and cheating on you but also for your own SA?? To this day, i have absolutely no idea how that was justified by joe or how it was forgiven by Lily.

Unfortunately, that isnt the end of what needs to be said here to get the full story. After this, Lily had gone through Joes phone to try and see if there was more to the story than what was being presented. Among everything else, Lily learned that Joe was consuming pornographic content VERY related to said sexual trauma. As far as i know, he had denied any interest in anything and everything related to consuming it or exploring it as a way to spice up the bedroom. And yet, there he was, absolutely fetishizing what Lily had gone through. 

If that wasnt heartbreaking enough, Joe had on multiple occasions after this came to light where he would recreate parts of Lilys trauma in the bedroom… without consent. Actually, with very clear and expressed verbal communication about things that should not be done. He was breaking boundaries and sending Lily into extreme panic attacks, mental break downs, and ideation.

My heart breaks for them over and over again writing this. I always try to communicate with Lily that I think absolutely none of this is okay but that I trust them to make the best decisions for themselves. At this point, i don't have that trust anymore, i really think that they should leave this relationship and i've been trying to communicate that in a gentle way up until this point. I dont think its fair to Lily for me to keep watching as my best friend is being crumpled up and thrown away by the person they love most in this world. I'm writing this out with the hope of giving Lily the opportunity to not just forget everything that Joes been putting them through but also get some much needed motivation and validation from reddit for them to actually leave. I want to see Lily safe and loved by someone that actually deserves all of the beauty that they bring to this world. 

Currently, they want to figure out all of this by doing individual and couples therapy for the both of them. This is something that Joe has agreed to and they plan on giving it 90 days as to see if all of his apologies are performative or not. I personally think that he's being extremely manipulative and continuing to lie about what happened... And I honestly believe it's just damage control for him. 

So i guess my question is, AITA or is he?

136,1dxac4c,AITA for Refusing to Let My Father in My Life?,"For context, I never had a close relationship with my father growing up. He struggled with gambling and alcohol issues. One Christmas, when I was young and had severe measles, my father didn’t take me to the doctor because he spent all the money on drinking. If my aunt hadn’t taken me to the hospital, I might not have survived, as the doctor said my condition was critical. The money he spent was my mother’s hard-earned money, intended for household bills, as she was working overseas.

My mother was the breadwinner, paying for almost everything, while my father only contributed to food. Additionally, my father’s side of the family frequently asked my mother for money and got upset when she sent money to her own siblings. I recall when my mother’s younger sister died, and she asked my father to use the money saved for building our house for the funeral, but he refused and my mom couldn’t do anything since shes in abroad working.

He never attended any of my school events, such as graduations or activities, preferring to send any random relative in his place because he didn’t want to go. Months after my aunt’s funeral, my mother finally decided to separate from him since they weren’t legally married.

Initially, he would visit me and give me money, but that didn’t last long. Soon, he vanished from my life entirely. For twelve years, he neither visited nor paid child support, nor did he attempt to build a relationship with me. He knew where I lived but never made an effort. His absence and neglect have caused me significant trauma and mental health problems. Now, as I am in my first year of college, he contacted me through Facebook.

My dog has coughing and gasping episodes once or twice a day that last less than 2 minutes or so and they are somewhat helped with cough syrup. She also moves very stiffly and can no longer go up and down the stairs. She doesn’t walk on her leash anymore (just goes in circles) and we transitioned to using peepee pads a year ago. Now she barely even gets out of her bed to pee and is starting to pee in her bed and just lay in it. She is also blind and deaf and just doesn’t appear to take much joy in anything. She mostly sleeps all day and, even when she eats, she just has her tail tucked between her legs and takes breaks and goes back multiple times to finish. Sometimes she stands up and just stares at the wall and, when she sleeps, she wheezes. I spoke to the vet and he said we could give her more medications and such but he also brought up euthanasia and giving her a “death of dignity.” My partner is frustrated with her messes and wants me to put the dog down, but every time I see her wag her tail (even though it’s rare) I worry that I’m being the asshole considering putting her down because she’s still alive and not terminally ill. I also can’t deny that I am also becoming frustrated with cleaning up after her, which just makes me feel even more guilty considering this. Am I the asshole for putting her down before her time?

138,1dxaajt,AITA for arguing with BPD gf for touching fridge/bags after handling raw meat (without washing hands),"My bpd gf was very hungry. Waited for me to wake up to drive her to the groceries and get some cooking ingredients. We get home. She starts cooking, and I notice her touching raw pork belly. She uses the contaminated hand to open the freezer door, and wrap the pork bag with it, and chuck it into the freezer. She has done this in the past (various other scenarios), she seems to not realize the significance of cross-contamination, existence of bacteria, and why we have safety procedures at restaurants. 

So I bring this up with her, she gets mad and keeps saying ""It's ok!"" but I insist it is not ok with me, as I am the primary cook of the house and also we have a cat that likes to explore the kitchen bench. And then it escalates and she asks ""You cook it if you don't like my cooking"" and ""Don't eat it then"" and ""Why dont you cook it yourself?"".

139,1dxa84k,AITA for stealing someones song?,"AITA for ""stealing"" someones karaoke song? 

I 27f, go to this bar that does karaoke every Fri & Sat. I'm there almost every weekend. 

Most regulars have their ""song"" they always do, I have a song too, but you can go multiple times and sing different songs. 

There's this girl, I'm assuming in her late 20s, early 30s we'll call Jessica. 
Jessica always does one song, she sings it every week almost and does fairly well at it. 

Well karaoke goes from 8pm to 12am, Jessica is normally here before then and stay til the end. I get here at the bar around 8:30ish and sign up for my stuff. We'll Jessica wasn't here this week at the normal time she usually is, and the song she normally does *is* a song I /wanted/ to try singing cus I love the song. There's no real rules with karaoke so I signed up for the song at 10pm because Jessica wasn't there and I wanted to give it a go. 

I did the song, people cheered etc and I thought that was that. Well Jessica showed up late, about 11ish and went to go sign up for her ""song"" and was told by the karaoke lady ""someone else sang it, but if you also wanna sing it, I'll squeeze you in""

Jessica didn't take to that well and was on a witch hunt for who sang HER song. I told her I did because she wasn't here and I wanted to try it, I wasn't trying to outshine her or steal her song I just loved it and wanted to give it a go. 
She called me an AH and said I should've known better and she's been getting other bar-goers to call me an AH for stealing her song. 

So reddit, am I the asshole?

140,1dxa7p0,AITA for giving in ultimatum for my cousin to live with me,"Recently, I gave my Aunt and Uncle an ultimatum about keeping their daughter for the school year. My cousin, Cassie, is 16 and very gifted. She’s recently got into a school that is very selective and even was able to score a full scholarship which they only give two students a year. This school can be a direct pipeline into college and the career field she wants for herself later in life.This school just so happens to be in the state in which I live and only a twenty minutes drive from my home. After thinking it over with my long term girlfriend of 5 years we have decided that as long as her parents are fine with it she can come stay with us. She’s gotten a once in a lifetime opportunity and we think she should pursue her dreams.

This caused me to have to break no contact. It is long story but short version is when I was 17, I am now 26, my twin sister, Nadine, knowingly cheated with my boyfriend for months behind my back. My parents took her side and called me a liar to my face and to others making me a social pariah in a small conservative area that I was this weirdo freak who was out for her twins bf. It didn’t help that I had always been less favored than Nadine by friends and family for reasons like being, introverted, “fat and ugly,”and being goth.  I knew my parents would never love or respect me the same as my twin.

When I left I kept in contact with my grandmother, who was my ONLY family that believed me. 2 years ago she put Cassie in contact with me to talk about personal issues she thought I could help Cassie with through experience as a safe trusted adult. After weeks of back and forth my aunt and uncle decided to let Cassie stay with me only if I spent some time with them to “re-know me” minimum 3 weeks. I think it’s reasonable request if they’re gonna let their child stay with me. That being said I do not want to be ambushed my parents or anyone else. Ive offered my home or a paid Airbnb somewhere in middle distance. They have repeatedly kept pushing with different excuses to stay at their house like their jobs, which they initially said they would take the time off for, before I brought up different locations. The final registration is due soon which means a decision has to be made shortly. Finally I said that if I am ambushed during my stay I will not take Cassie and have her used as a pawn into my life.

They could tell I was being serious and started going down different paths of shaming me and pleading with me. They have said if I meet with just them it will ruin their relationship with my parents and others. At the same time this a dream opportunity for Cassie. They’ve called me selfish for putting them in the middle, but I am simply making boundaries clear. My girlfriend’s mom gave me a shocking POV semi agreeing with my aunt and uncle.

141,1dx9x2g,AITA for trying to push my friend into talking about a fight we had,"So, I (31F) am not a confrontational person. Fights have always made me super uncomfortable (blah blah childhood trauma).

Anyway, my friend (42M, y’all I know there’s an age gap) has this habit when anyone around him gets upset or mad. He ends up trying to make jokes or say distracting things. He says it’s to “make the other person laugh” but also confessed situations like that make him uncomfortable. He’s done this many times with me.

This whole fight is over text. 

So it starts by him calling periods TMI. I was talking about periods, I was worried about my bff. 
I call him out on that saying ‘It’s not, all women have periods. And all women poop too.’ Trying to push the fact that it’s a normal body function. 
I know he was joking but he pulls the “I’m a man, we think it’s gross” card. Which in hindsight shouldn’t have triggered me as much as it did. So I called him sexist. 

He decided to lean into it. Making jokes about being sexist. This made me uncomfortable so I told him to stop. Then it turned into a more petty fight where he started calling me sexist too. So I started saying serious stuff about the female experience. The jokes continued until I snapped. The actual text: “This isn’t funny! Or a joke [redacted]! I’m being f-king serious right now.”

Went to bed, woke up still angry, and no response from him. So I sent him 3 voice memos. Saying that I don’t like when he makes jokes when I’m trying to talk to him about something serious. 

Still no response, the next day. I send a message saying, “clearly we need to talk about this. We are 2 grown ass adults. I think we can manage that.”

A few hours later, I finally got a response saying “Sure but I’m super busy. So expect a delay, maybe the weekend.”I was accepting of that.

Then today, Saturday, I know he does absolutely nothing on Saturdays usually. I know he usually puts his phone on mute. But I figured he’d make the exception since he had the time. 

Nope. 

I send a “Hey” message which is unlike me but I knew he’d take it as “Hey I want to have that talk.” 

7 hours later, I get a text pretty much saying, “hey today sucks, hope yours didn’t suck as bad. I’m gonna put my phone back on silent now. Bye.” Which is EXTREMELY odd and honestly feels super avoidant. 

I send an ok and then cause I’m super petty I also send “Should I just let go of the talk?” 

No responses yet.

It just really bugs me because he has all of Saturday to do this. And I know for a fact his Sundays are always packed too. Either his D&D group, other friends, one of his casual sex partners Or he does the phone silent thing again. Then all of the week of work, all over again. 
It’s just super frustrating and feels really avoidant. 

So, AITA?

Also, he’s way more on Reddit than I am so he might see this. I know that has happened with stories. 
I don’t really care.

144,1dx9f3i,WIBTA for telling someone off for telling me how to do something theyve never done,"Context: I live in an RV Park/trailer park combo (has both RV spaces and full trailers). My landlord lives in an RV park at the front of the park, and has several solar panels mounted to the roof using Renogy Z brackets covered in sealant. He had a few cracked solar panels and asked if I could take his old panels down and put new ones in their place (a job I've done before, but not with this type of bracket).

Now, with these brackets, two bolts go into the roof, and one nut attaches to the bottom of the solar panel to hold it on, with 4 brackets per panel. They leave about 1/2"" of clearance between the roof and the panel. There is no corresponding screw at the top of the panel. 

The only way I could see to remove the panels without rigging a sketchy solution (like a wrench taped to a stick) was to remove the brackets from the roof, then remove them from the panel.

145,1dx8s30,AITA for kicking my sister and her family out in the middle of the night in a different country?,"So I 28F have moved to the US three years ago with my husband 30M after getting our Greencards approved. We moved to central Florida, notorious for all it’s tourist attractions. Since we moved, my sister 33F and her family Husband 37M, nephew 13M and niece 11F have visited every year around this time. We love to host and even bought a house to accommodate family and friends visiting (2 guest bed). 

The issue started on the 3rd day of their visit. I left the night before for a night shift at the hospital and my husband had a very early one. When I got home by 1pm I found my puppy (9month) locked in the garage! He doesn’t have access to that area because there is no AC there (this is Florida in the summer!) and I am afraid he will run away when the door opens.
It was pure luck that he was laying down so close to the entry door, or I could have ran him over before I saw him!  He was lethargic and breathing heavily, so I immediately took him to the vet. He was overheated and dehydrated. And he could have passed if I hadn’t gotten there when I did.
I finally returned home at about 7pm. When I entered I instantly saw my favorite vase (I got it from my late grandma) wasn’t in the center table. I opened the trash only to find it there, in pieces. I was already fuming about my puppy. 

When I pulled up the images from the house cameras I had recently installed bc of the dog. In the images I saw that at 9ish the kids said goodbye to my husband and their parents and when they left, they proceeded to discuss e whose turn was it to break something. My nephew argued that he had done it last year, so it was my niece’s turn. My niece then proceeded to throw 1 grass on the floor. At which point my puppy got fussy and started barking. They got annoyed so they took him to the garage before returning, picking up my vase and smashing on the floor. When their parents returned they simply said they had an accident. My sister cleaned it up and they made their way to the parks!

My blood boiled. I immediately packed their bags and put it by the door (my husband arrived and helped out).
As soon as they arrived I told them how their kids behaved, that they caused harm to my dog and broke something irreplaceable to me. My sister tried to argue that it was an accident and that they’re just kids and I shoved the video into her face. She still tried to argue saying we were family and she didn’t have money to pay for s hotel for the rest of the trip and it was the middle of the night. I simply stated I didn’t care and she had to take her little monsters away from me. 

She left screaming and then crying. Obviously, this morning I woke up to several messages in the family group calling me all sorts of names for kicking them out in a different country and how I was being mean. My mom wrote about how disappointed she was at me.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-07,"AITA for kicking my sister and her family out in the middle of the night in a different country? So I 28F have moved to the US three years ago with my husband 30M after getting our Greencards approved. We moved to central Florida, notorious for all it’s tourist attractions. Since we moved, my sister 33F and her family Husband 37M, nephew 13M and niece 11F have visited every year around this time. We love to host and even bought a house to accommodate family and friends visiting (2 guest bed). 

The issue started on the 3rd day of their visit. I left the night before for a night shift at the hospital and my husband had a very early one. When I got home by 1pm I found my puppy (9month) locked in the garage! He doesn’t have access to that area because there is no AC there (this is Florida in the summer!) and I am afraid he will run away when the door opens.
It was pure luck that he was laying down so close to the entry door, or I could have ran him over before I saw him!  He was lethargic and breathing heavily, so I immediately took him to the vet. He was overheated and dehydrated. And he could have passed if I hadn’t gotten there when I did.
I finally returned home at about 7pm. When I entered I instantly saw my favorite vase (I got it from my late grandma) wasn’t in the center table. I opened the trash only to find it there, in pieces. I was already fuming about my puppy.

146,1dx8ndh,AITA for insisting my gf parents follow a decontamination process before entering my house?,"I (23F) am a germaphobe. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been extremely cautious about cleanliness and hygiene. My girlfriend Katelyn (24F) has always been supportive of my need to keep our apartment as germ-free as possible. Even though she doesn't understand it, she lets me do my thing.


However, her parents (57F and 54M) dont even slightly respect my concern. They drop by unannounced, tracking in dirt and who knows what else. After this happened a few times and I felt uncomfortable in my home, I decided to implement a decontamination process for anyone coming in. Here’s the process:


1. **Remove shoes and leave them outside in a cubby.**
2. **Use hand sanitizer provided at the door.**
3. **Wear clean clothes or change into an outfit provided by us (I buy extras for this purpose and they keep the clothes they use).**
4. **Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.**
5. **Wear a face mask while inside (I buy disposable ones).**


Katie’s parents think this is very excessive and refuse every time. They argue that they are healthy, fully vaccinated, and that I’m just overreacting. Last week, they showed up for dinner without warning and when I reminded them of the steps, they refused again. I finally stood my ground and told them they couldn’t come in unless they decontaminated. They left very angrily, and Katie is now upset with me for damaging the relationship between us and her parents.


She believes I’m being a bit unreasonable and that it’s causing unnecessary tension in our family. She’s suggested we compromise, but I feel like I shouldn’t have to compromise on this. Our house is always spotless and clean but her parents show up unannounced thinking they own the place. These rules make me feel safe in my own home so I feel like they shouldn't be an issue. If you can't follow them, don't come over yk?


I want to clarify this, I am always happy to visit her parents house and just wear a mask but they choose to come here instead. Also, I do wear a mask when company is over so it's not one sided.

148,1dx89qh,WIBTA if I (f31) went on a trip with my best friend's (31f) ex-fiance (34m)?,"For some background, I met my two best friends Dylan (34m) and Rosie (31f) in college. They were a couple when I met them, but I became close to each individually. I now live in a different state, but we video call often and I visit them when I can. They were engaged and both wanted me in their bridal/groom party; Dylan, having fewer friends, asked me to be his best man while I participated in bridesmaid activities. Unfortunately, the engagement is off. The breakup was mutual but not amicable, due to various issues over the past two years, including chronic illness, death, and mental health struggles.

Rosie (the dumpee) texted me saying she didn’t want to talk, especially to me. She suggested that I maintain my friendship with Dylan but not with her, implying she didn’t want to jeopardize Dylan’s friendship with me. This confused me, as I believed I could remain friends with both, especially since we’re long-distance. However, she insisted, citing her love for Dylan and not wanting him to lose our friendship. Rosie has always been somewhat insecure about my relationship with Dylan, as he and I are very similar while they were more opposite. Early on, she shared these insecurities, and I understood completely. Dylan and I have always kept our friendship strictly platonic.

Dylan (the dumper) has been open about the breakup and, despite being my best friend, has always maintained good boundaries, never oversharing. Now that he’s single, he video chats with me weekly to update me or just chat and draw. He’s also dealing with his mother’s sudden death a few months ago, adding to his emotional load.

Here’s my dilemma: Dylan’s family, aware of my support for him, invited me to their beach house for a week to participate in his mother’s ash scattering/memorial. This was his father’s idea to prevent Dylan from feeling lonely, and Dylan said he’d like it if I came. While I’m touched by their fondness and offer to fly me out, I feel uneasy about accepting. I’ve never felt anything romantic for Dylan, nor has he for me, but going on vacation with Rosie’s ex-fiance feels wrong, especially so soon after their breakup. Rosie and Dylan are in complete no-contact, except for finance/housing matters, and although she’s not speaking to me, it feels wrong not to inform her about the trip. My options are:

A) Not tell her and go, though this feels skeezy.  
B) Tell her and risk making her feel worse, regardless of whether I go or not. She’d likely say she’s fine with me going to support Dylan but still feel hurt.  
C) Not go on the trip and let Dylan cope with his family.

I want to support both of them. Friends have advised that since Dylan is openly asking for support, while Rosie is denying it, I should help the friend willing to accept it. However, others argue it’s wrong to go on a trip with my best friend’s ex just weeks after their breakup, considering the principle. WIBTA if I went on the trip, or even told Rosie about it? What should I do?

  
EDIT: for some more info, I believe that this is only a temporary breakup with Rosie. I asked her if I could reach out in a few weeks to check up on her.

It has been a downhill bridezilla spiral ever since. Examples include unable to make any decisions and wanting opinions but changing her own opinion every hour for three days, and still wanting input on every change (I wish I was exaggerating); ignoring me when she doesn’t like a response I give, talking disturbingly badly about her fiance (37M); when challenging her thinking about the way she talks to him/their relationship red flags, talking in circles until she receives the affirmation she wants (including non stop texting about him even at 1 am while I was on a business trip); zero self awareness when I’ve pointed out on multiple occasions “I feel like I’m annoying/upsetting you, is there something I’m doing or should be saying differently” and receive only excuses as to why she’s treating me how she is… the list goes on. 

I started putting up my own boundary and no longer being available to receive this energy, finally calling her out for a very specific behavior (of which I was met with “actually I’m not doing that”), which I then learned she began talking to (aka lie to make her look in the right) other people about our conversations to anyone who would listen and affirm her. (Whatever she said, made people literally call me a b*tch.) I also stopped giving direct opinions, and instead saying “whatever you like!” “If you like it that’s all that matters” etc. 

We have now had the bachelorette (in May) and I worked super hard to make it planned well and make sure she had fun. I really thought I had done a great job, but (again) just found out she was talking badly about me to other attendees blaming anything that didn’t go perfectly on me (when in reality she was so awkward it was really uncomfortable at times).

I (18F) live at home as a way to save on costs for college and have been doing my own laundry since I started high school. It was out of motivated self-interested (in a house of five people, laundry takes a while and I would sometimes want to wear specific things), but in recent years I've been building resentment with my parents over laundry.

The problem stems from the same scenario. A parent puts a load of laundry into the washer, and then there it sits, sometimes never having been run in the first place. Days on end, on some occasions. Then I bring my laundry in, and have to do both this load of laundry in addition to my own so that I can clean my clothes. I've brought up the issue casually before, simply requesting that clothes can not be left sitting in the W/D units, and have been promised they will not. No dice, it has continued over the course of three plus years. I am essentially doing the entire house's laundry (four people beside me, now one additional girlfriend that is living here temporarily while looking for an apartment) AND folding it all so that I can wash my things. My tipping point was reached when I let my parents know that I need the W/D for my work uniform because it had been stained the day before and I need to clean it before my shift that night. Long story short, I wasn't able to get to work on time because I had to do their load of laundry (one in washer, one in dryer) in addition to my own. 
Furious, this last time today it happened I had had enough and tossed anything in my way on the laundry room floor so I could do my laundry and left it there. I got a nasty text from my dad while at work telling me that I 'wasn't 12, you can use your words when something is upsetting you.' Except I HAVE. And no one has listened to me. I don't like being in conflict with my parents because normally we get along, but I don't enjoy sifting through everyone else' laundry to do my own. Was I wrong for what I did? 

For reference, I cannot go to a laundromat. We do not have one nearby and I am not driving over 10 miles to do laundry when we have a unit that works just fine in my own home.

152,1dx7wf7,AITA - House sitting for a family member,"Long time lurker, first post :) 
Basically, I had a family member ask if I wanted to house sit while they’re away. I said sure, they have a beautiful home and they also said I could have people over. 
Later on, I asked what the compensation would be. In my previous experience, family members & friends have always paid me for taking care of their pets, taking care of plants, and overall making sure the house was orderly when they got back.
When I asked her about payment, she snapped and basically said it was a privilege to stay in their big house for free. I was taken aback - I thought it was normal to compensate someone if they’re going out of their way to drive to take care of your home, pets, plants, etc.

When I asked her about payment, she snapped and basically said it was a privilege to stay in their big house for free. I was taken aback - I thought it was normal to compensate someone if they’re going out of their way to drive to take care of your home, pets, plants, etc.

153,1dx7et6,AITA? Friend is mad at me about Star Wars,"
I’m a pretty big Star Wars fan. I’ve read a couple of the books, watched all the movies, and shows since the beginning of the pandemic. 

A couple years after the pandemic I met my  friend, Teri. Teri is very sweet and very funny. They have always been very supportive to me and we have always helped each other with any situations we are facing, but in the recent few months I’ve noticed that Teri has been dismissive and annoyed whenever I talk about Star Wars.

The first time Teri was upset with me I took it as, I was talking too much and they may have a headache so I stopped talking and listened to our other friend start a new conversation. The second time I tried talking about Star Wars I was met with annoyance again from Teri. So I stopped talking about it. The third time it happened I was only talking about how I really enjoyed the Clone Wars series with a friend who also likes Star Wars and I said “I like Star Wars a lot haha.” Teri got mad at me and said “Yeah, we can tell you like Star Wars.” I shut up after that because they’ve never been passive aggressive at me before.

After they said that I pretty much never mentioned anything Star Wars related for a month until about a week ago. Last week I started talking about the clone wars again, I had just rewatched some episodes, and I really wanted to talk to Teri about it. I was hoping that enough time had passed where I could talk about it again. As I was talking to them about it they looked up at me and said “hey just so you know, I wasn’t listening to anything you were saying for the past hour. All I heard was “Star Wars” and that’s it.” Now I feel like an asshole for talking so much. When I look back at it now, yes I was very talkative about Star wars but I wasn’t always talking about it, hell I barely ever talk at school and when I do it’s to talk about what someone else is currently interested in.

Now this same thing has been happening but with my other interests I have only mentioned to them once or twice. I mentioned one time I was playing a specific video game and they said “wow all you ever do now is play that game all day.”At this point I maybe the a-hole but I want to know from others if I am. am I the a-hole for talking a lot about Star Wars? 


Edit: Those so far who have commented, I really do appreciate your input. A few of you have told me to work on reading the room and I will, so thank you. 


Update?: 
- I’m getting some weird signals from Teri now. All of a sudden they keep sending SW posts to me, but I’ve been ignoring it. Not really sure what I should do now but I’m going to continue ignoring the SW posts and divert the conversation to something else. 

- I also will be leaving them alone about the SW stuff. Obviously now I realize I was being obnoxious the last time. I probably should have mentioned that before I went on my hour long tangent about SW, they asked me to explain the story of one of the shows. Not sure if that adds anything to the post, but it’s a detail I probably should have included. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-07,"AITA? Friend is mad at me about Star Wars

Really quickly I started to realize that she wasn’t a good friend and that she just played a roll in the beginning for me to think that we were completely alike and we like twins. So I decided to cut her off but, before I could do that I had to get off the phone plan that I was on with her. I paid off the phone and the phone company said I didn’t need to do anything else. Until today she texted me saying that she was still getting charged on her phone plan for my line. So I told her what the phone company said and I was confused but I said okay just send me the bill. After having no contact with each other it was awkward because she knew I was ignoring her. She then asked if we were still friends and if not that she  wants me to only give back the Xbox and a Stanley cup that she got me because she said it’s unfair for me to keep them in we are not friends anymore. She said that she would return a pair of shoes I got for her for Christmas and a Stanley cup I got for her (which I don’t want). What she doesn’t know is that I sold the Xbox for a fairly cheap price because I wanted to get rid of it and not have anything she gave me.

157,1dx6wxk,AITA for not spending my birthday with my family,"Hi everyone. I’m 20F and I have always spent my family with my mom and brother in some capacity. This year however I will be turning 21 and I would really like to hang out with my uni friends and maybe even do the drinking around the world at Epcot.

There’s only one other time that I’ve ever spent away from home for my birthday when I turned 19. My bday falls around a holiday so I just stayed on campus that year because I needed space and a mentor of mine had also passed away days prior to my birthday.

My mom however didn’t like when I told her I wanted to stay at school that time and made me feel bad that I didn’t want to come home. (I didn’t tell her that my mentor passed away I just wasn’t in the headspace to relay that information.) Regardless, she told me that I was being selfish because our trio only gets together during certain times of the year including my birthday. (That in itself feels like a lot of pressure.) 

She started making me feel bad again when I told her a few days ago about my potential 21st birthday plans and constantly said that I must hate being around her, that I like my friends more than my family, and that I only care about myself. Which hurt.

I also just want the reassurance I’ll be happy on my birthday because they’re usually stressful for me and I don’t feel happy during them. (Ex: for my 20th birthday I wanted to go a regular comfort food restaurant for me but they pressured me to go to a really fancy restaurant because that’s where I should want to be eating on my birthday. I didn’t like the food options and I ended up crying in the restaurant bathroom and begged them to leave.)

She’s still doesn’t like that I had an issue with restaurant last year and I told her that this year I’d still celebrate just not on the actually day of my birthday.


I’m sorry if that was information overload but I just want to know if there’s a perspective I’m missing.

TLDR: I want to go to Epcot for my 21st birthday with my friends instead of spending it at home with my family but my mom said I’m being selfish because we don’t come together many times a year and my birthday is one of those times. I said I would still come home just not on the day, but she doesn’t like that idea. AITA?

160,1dx5w6h,WIBTA to give back a gift I don’t like?,"Quick context: last year I was looking at buying a digital piano. I moved out of my family home and missed being able to practice. I didn’t buy one then because - from research - I should be looking around £400 in price for a really good keyboard. 

I decided I’d rather wait to afford a good quality one than buy a cheaper one. At the time I told my family I wanted one, and the cost concern, but not how much I wanted to save to buy one. 

This year I was surprised with a keyboard for my birthday. They didn’t tell me the price, but from Amazon it was either £170 or £230 (Mustar - brand). The more expensive claims to have hammer weighted keys and the cheaper says it is semi-weighted. They both claim to be touch sensitive. 

I think I have the costlier one, but they look identical so it is hard to tell. 

The problem - I exclusively play classical music. The keyboard keys seem to press really quickly and there doesn’t seem to be a volume difference if I press hard or soft. The end result is the songs sound really different, the chord side overwhelms the melody in volume and it is difficult to not accidentally press nearby keys since they have little resistance. 

I was in tears earlier trying to convince myself I like this keyboard because I am very grateful for the gift, but I can’t. I just hate it. The songs sounds different and we have an expensive Yamaha digital grand at home so I know how good digital keyboards can sound and feel. 

I can barely afford at the moment to purchase a digital keyboard of my original budget. I just don’t know what to do with the one I was gifted. 

Part of me is tempted to sell it and put the money towards a new one. It is part the 30 days return date.

I’m somewhat hoping if I give it back they could try to recoup some money and I won’t ask to keep any of it…

I feel awful that I hate this keyboard, but I also know I won’t use it while the songs sound awful on it. It just feels really rude to tell someone their thoughtful gift isn’t expensive enough. I just wish instead of surprising me they had asked what I was looking for in a keyboard

I apologise for not giving all the details - I wanted to focus on whether it is wrong to want to swap a gift since I found its quality not enough for what I want. 

Anyway a quick timeline:

- I was given the gift over video call around my birthday. The gift was shown in only its cardboard box so I couldn’t see the keyboard. I had to ask later what the brand was. The keyboard was at my family’s home in a different city to where I live

- I asked later that day if they could a) drive it to me (2-3 hours one-way) or b) my preferred option of returning the keyboard and reordering an identical one where I live to no extra cost for either of us 

Both options were turned down and they say I would have to collect the keyboard myself. I don’t have a drivers license

- The duration of the 30-day return period ran out while they were abroad and very busy. There was no available time for me to go back home for the keyboard

- Today was the first day I could go back (after the 30 days). The keyboard is way too heavy to lift, let alone manoeuvre alone on a train so I paid near £90 to get a taxi to bring it back with me to my city. I had no opportunity at this time to open it and test it since they had put it into a storage container and only agreed to get it back at the end of the evening. 

I paid this because I trusted their judgement in choosing the gift and because the online listing said the piano was touch sensitive and hammer grade weighted etc. Plus we own a very expensive digital grand at home that feels like a real piano. They spent hours choosing that one, so I assumed that they would look for similar features in a new keyboard 

I did find their actions during this annoying, but ultimately I don’t think it should be relevant to what I wanted to ask",Not the A-hole,2024-07-07,"WIBTA to give back a gift I don’t like? Quick context: last year I was looking at buying a digital piano. I moved out of my family home and missed being able to practice. I didn’t buy one then because - from research - I should be looking around £400 in price for a really good keyboard. 

I decided I’d rather wait to afford a good quality one than buy a cheaper one. At the time I told my family I wanted one, and the cost concern, but not how much I wanted to save to buy one. 

This year I was surprised with a keyboard for my birthday. They didn’t tell me the price, but from Amazon it was either £170 or £230 (Mustar - brand). The more expensive claims to have hammer weighted keys and the cheaper says it is semi-weighted. They both claim to be touch sensitive. 

I think I have the costlier one, but they look identical so it is hard to tell. 

The problem - I exclusively play classical music. The keyboard keys seem to press really quickly and there doesn’t seem to be a volume difference if I press hard or soft. The end result is the songs sound really different, the chord side overwhelms the melody in volume and it is difficult to not accidentally press nearby keys since they have little resistance. 

I was in tears earlier trying to convince myself I like this keyboard because I am very grateful for the gift, but I can’t. I just hate it. The songs sounds different and we have an expensive Yamaha digital grand at home so I know how good digital keyboards can sound and feel. 

I can barely afford at the moment to purchase a digital keyboard of my original budget. I just don’t know what to do with the one I was gifted. 

Part of me is tempted to sell it and put the money towards a new one. It is part the 30 days return date.

I’m somewhat hoping if I give it back they could try to recoup some money and I won’t ask to keep any of it…

I feel awful that I hate this keyboard, but I also know I won’t use it while the songs sound awful on it. It just feels really rude to tell someone their thoughtful gift isn’t expensive enough. I just wish instead of surprising me they had asked what I was looking for in a keyboard

164,1dx59xt,AITA for not thinking about asking my cousin to ride my coworker back home?,"So I (M22) work as a waiter in the big plaza on my town, and in summer my coworkers and me commonly drink bears at 00:30 and we relax a slight bit after the shift, this day I decided to drink a gintonic instead and I get drunk easily so we can say I was tipsy during the moment I'll tell right now

So a group of two girls and me after drinking we part by foot together because we live more or less in the same direction, but we live like 5-7 min walking apart of each other. Coincidentally as we walk though a crosswalk a car comes and horns at us, and it was my cousin which i'm real close of and I consider one of my biggest friends. It was really uncommon to see him around these hours since he works during morning shifts, so I get in the car quickly as i say goodbye to my coworkers, but lets call her girl 2 yells at me something on the lines of ""really you are leaving us like this?"", i jokingly say something like yes bet you can hold up without me.

Also important, girl 2 was like 50 steps from her house, girl 1 who didn't say much was as I said, 5 minutes from where it happened. And despite walking around the night, in this town you can walk safe around and these walks they have done them many times alone.

  
Since it was rare finding my cousin there I thought it could be his day off and maybe we could go partying or something, but seems he just came out of one and he had to wake up early at morning, so we chatted a little bit as he took me to my home.

Next day I get to work and girl 1 who I get along with is acting real cold with me for like an hour, I decide to tell her if somethings wrong and she starts saying I'm selfish, that how I didn't tell my cousin to bring her back home, how i can leave her walking alone during the night, that I'm gonna die alone for being like this, and it's understandable nobody loves me. My answer was that why she wouldn't have told me I would have said something to him if she had told me, and that I didn't to it intentionally only it just didn't cross my mind, and she said that i'm selfish for not offering seat to her. Later she told every coworker about this and now i'm like the evil guy

Here's the dilemma I've been thinking the whole day, am I real selfish for the thought not crossing my mind, that I only cared there about my own business? Point number 1, I didn't expect to my cousin bringing me back home, I thought we could go somewhere or some pub and be there, point number 2, it wasn't actually my own car, it's my cousin's so I don't rule over it and isn't actually SELFISH using my cousin as a taxi for a complete stranger for him, point number 3 couldn't she just have told me? Or told him? Point number 4 is shortening 5 minute walk that serious to be so angry for? And point number 5 they have walked back home safe many times during night but now I was irrespectful for letting her walk alone?

So yeah after parting tonight on the way back home, girl 1 said that she'll block me on ig and whatsapp, and I'm now writing this

Our friend started this chat room on social media  years ago as a way for all of our childhood friends to keep in touch with each other  since we only saw each other not that often and mainly  on special occasions. It’s was about 15 of us in there. The same friend who started this chat room years ago passed away last year but we kept the chat room open and even named it after him. Let’s call him Blue to avoid confusion. 

About a few weeks ago I heard that one of our friends “Jake” was secretly messaging the girls that some of the other friends were dating or having sex with that they mentioned in the chat. A day later my friend “Tim” threw Jake out the  chat and me and a few other people. I asked why was I getting removed and TIm said “because he only wants to discuss his business with friends that see more often and not friends he barely see”.  I said “but Blue made this chat to keep everyone connected, it’s no way he would’ve done this if he was still alive”. He responded “we are still friends when we see each other and it’s no love lost or anything”. 

I wind up cursing him out about it. I later apologized but was still low key pissed he kicked me out especially being I ain’t do nothing, I never told his business and got kicked out cause of what someone else did. My friend Blue would never wanted this to happen if he was here. 

My friend “Tommy” tried to get me back in chat but only to instigate a fight between me and Tim. I know this because Tim showed me screenshots of Tommy laughing and instigating showing me that Tommy only wanted me back in chat to cause a fight between me and Tim because he knew I was upset about getting thrown out the room
