0,1dxw2cz,AITA for telling my friend that her mom is overbearing?,"I (18f) was in the car with my friend Mia, (fake name) (18f), and we were driving home from the beach. We had been talking about different topics, from Tv shows we had watched recently to our love lifes, and the topic of our futures came up. I started talking about how I would move out, that my goal was just to get a stable job, and move in with my boyfriend. We parked in a parking lot, and Mia looked at me confused, asking ""You want to move out?"" I ask what she meant, and she explained that her mom to live with her forever. I was confused since my mom was different, and expected me to move out shortly. Mia explained that her mom was new to parenting and that she was just worried for her. I'll mention that Mia's mom is also very invested in her personal life, calls every 2 hours, wants to know where she is at all times, and wants to know every detail about everything, down to conversations with friends and her activities on dates, she was only just recently allowed to date.

I ask if she would just live in her mom's house once she was married, and Mia said she didn't know and laughed it off. I didn't press the issue further since I didn't want to cross a line. We moved on, when Mia's mom calls and told her to come home immediately. She didn't want Mia out so late (It was 6:30). So we leave, and she drives to drop me off, so the topic resurfaced. Mia mentions that her mom wanted her home because she was afraid that Mia was keeping things from her. I asked what she meant and she said that she had been out with her first boyfriend and kissed him. Mia said her mom was upset that she ""hid it"", telling her mom later in the day when she asked. I was really surprised, and told Mia that my mom was the total opposite, we keep our lives separate, and I don't really tell my mom that kind of stuff. I tried to word it in the best way possible that I didn't upset her. She went on to explain that her mom was really only looking out for her, and said that her mom said she didn't want Mia and her boyfriend to be romantic with eachother. 

Internally, my jaw was dropped. I really didn't know what to say, so I told her that ""At the end of the day, your life is your own, and you shouldn't let your mom influence that. I don't know the full relationship between you and your mom, but your relationship shouldn't be controlled by what she thinks-"" And Mia interrupted by saying her mom wasn't controlling. I said I misspoke and didn't mean it like that, but I could tell she was upset. I tried to make it better by apologizing if I overstepped and she didn't say anything. She changed the subject after a beat of silence, so I didn't mention it again. She dropped me off and waved goodbye with a smile as if nothing was wrong, even if she's going to tell her mom about it later. Her mom might make Mia cut me off, so it has me wondering.

1,1dxvzou,AITA for not accepting an unfinished bookshelf from my husband?,"A few months  ago I jokingly asked my husband to build me a bookshelf which he decided he wanted to do. I told him multiple times that I can just buy one and he doesn't have to make it (he's handy but hasn't never done something this big). He insisted on making it himself which I am incredibly grateful for. 

After a few weeks of working on it it's finally ""done"". But the thing is it's incredibly rough to the touch and needs to be sanded again and have another final coat put on. He didn't properly research how to apply poly. I mentioned that I looked it up and it should be sanded with another coat put on and he basically told me I'm just complaining and ungrateful. I told him I don't want to put books on it where they can rip or get damaged (many are collector's, limited edition, or signed copies), it hurts if you brush bare skin against it, and it will be impossible to clean. Am I being unreasonable for wanting him to finish the project he insisted on doing himself? Or should I just accept it how it is? I'm not handy myself and have back issues which is why I told him MANY times I could just buy one. It is a gorgeous bookshelf and exactly what I wanted other than the fact that it feels like sandpaper 

UPDATE: I just wanted to answer a few comments I keep seeing.

1. I won't be using it for something else because he put a LOT of work into it and built it custom for this area and this purpose.
2. I'm not going to hire someone else to fix it, that would be very insulting to him and I'd simply rather do it myself at that point
3. YES, I could put contact paper or something of the sort down but I simply don't want to. It is not the look I'm going for and won't stick to the surface. 
4. Everyone is being pretty harsh on him. He has built many other things but has not worked with stain and poly more than once or twice and simply didn't do the research on how to properly apply it because he didn't realize it wasn't as simple as brush it(the poly) on.
5. After a while he realized I was right and it is too rough, he realized he can pretty easily lightly sand it and I told him that if I still want a smoother finish after that I will apply another coat myself(which he would probably end up doing for me anyway).

I understand why he was frustrated because after spending weeks on this project and thinking it was finally done he learns he has more to do. It is 8 ft high, 4 ft wide and laying on the ground so his back is hurting too.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for not accepting an unfinished bookshelf from my husband?

2,1dxvvzx,AITA For asking a trans man to walk me home ,"AITA For asking a trans man to walk me home?

I 20F was invited to visit my sister 24 and friends met at University.
I knew a couple of them, and one the trans man in particular more than others, I did not know some of them.

On the second day, we had all gone out for some drinks to celebrate finishing Uni, we had eaten out during the day and I suspected I had been accidentally given some gluten/gluten cross contamination happened and so wasn’t feeling well, and was feeling worse as the time went on.
I have an intolerance, so I was NOT in danger, just feeling nauseous with stomach pain/cramps.

One of her friends I’ll call him Alex 25ish, seems to like me, and had been trying to flirt despite me telling him I wasn’t interested.

I said I was going to walk back to their apartment where I was staying as I wasn’t feeling well, I knew roughly where we were and where I needed to go, and was happy to go alone (maybe 10 minutes walk) I also had my phone with google maps if I needed it.

Alex immediately wanted to walk me home, and I tried to gently say I was fine he could stay and have fun etc.

Her trans friend Liam 23, then offered and said he was tired anyway.

I felt more comfortable with Liam as I knew him far better, and he wasn’t continually flirting making me uncomfortable.

I accepted Liam’s offer and we left, Alex was visibly annoyed and tried to make me change me mind or let him come too.
We insisted we were fine and then a couple others came over to find him so he left.
Liam did return to the party a while later.

Well, apparently I caused issues.
Being more comfortable with Liam is “transphobic as I don’t perceive him as a real man and therefore also a danger”
And I “put him in danger”.

There’s been a lot of back and forth over similar points, there’s a rift in my sisters friend group and half are angry at me.
Sis isn’t sure who to side with, and is t sure what happened exactly as she wasn’t there at the time of the conversation.

3,1dxvqvb,AITA for solving a problem?,"So, 3 months ago I [F27] had this idea of organizing a vacation for a group of 12 people. I created a team in messenger and invited 12 people (friends of mine and my husband's [M26] to a certain location. 
It took us some time to be ready about the specifics and the location wasnt available anymore. Everybody agreed on looking for another location which we did eventually and two of my husband's friends decided to book the place. They gave us time until Tuesday to answer a messenger poll and the next day they would call the place.
One of our friends bailed out and one of my friends who hadn't given a straight answer yet, forgot to answer the poll so they didn't include her in the booking. 
When we realized the mix up, I asked the one who booked the place to call the owner and inform him about being 11 people and not 12. If the price would change, my friend would pay the difference. Keep in mind it was two villas, able to house 6 people each. 
He immediately refused claiming the price he ""negotiated"" was strictly for 10 people and nothing could be done. We asked him nicely to give it a try and make the call but he refused even harder, talking about how it was he who organized the whole thing and she shouldn't forgotten about answering the poll and it has been months my friend knew about the vacation and didn't give a straight answer. 
I asked for the telephone number to call myself but he still refused. I informed him that I would find the phone in google and that I only called him because he was the one who already talked with the place. 
I found the phone, I called, and the owner told me that it didn't matter how many of us would be as long as we weren't over 6 people in the villa. I offered to pay more and he told me the price is the same either we were 8 people or 12 people. As long as we are not more. 
When I anounced that the problem is solved, he and another one of his friends got so mad at me that almost cancelled the vacation. I couldn't understand what the problem was and their answers were the following : 
- How dare you call the owner while I was the one that did the booking?
- You should be ashamed of what you did 
- We gave time till Tuesday and she never answered, she shouldn't come. 
- We could have invited other friends of ours to the vacation but we didn't because they didn't answer on time. Why should she come as she didn't answer on time ?

Yesterday I told her that since I have been the one feeding and watering all of the cats, I am the one along with Mom actually working on introducing her to the other cats, and once I start my new job I am going to be the one completely responsible for the cat essentials (food, litter, treats to try and help with positive reinforcement so we can get her used to a crate if we ever need to put her in one again, as well as to trim her claws.) that unless she gets to actually doing what she is supposed to then this is my cat because I'm doing what she was told to, to keep the cat.

  
She is mad because ""you had a cat and a dog already why should you get another one and you put your dog down"" Yes both my cat and dog have passed, but one from old age, and the other was put down because he had neuropathy and couldn't walk anymore, not like I just got tired of him or something but not being able to move is not a life for any living creature.
