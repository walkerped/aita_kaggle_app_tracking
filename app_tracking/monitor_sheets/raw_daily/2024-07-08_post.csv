0,1dxw2cz,AITA for telling my friend that her mom is overbearing?,"I (18f) was in the car with my friend Mia, (fake name) (18f), and we were driving home from the beach. We had been talking about different topics, from Tv shows we had watched recently to our love lifes, and the topic of our futures came up. I started talking about how I would move out, that my goal was just to get a stable job, and move in with my boyfriend. We parked in a parking lot, and Mia looked at me confused, asking ""You want to move out?"" I ask what she meant, and she explained that her mom to live with her forever. I was confused since my mom was different, and expected me to move out shortly. Mia explained that her mom was new to parenting and that she was just worried for her. I'll mention that Mia's mom is also very invested in her personal life, calls every 2 hours, wants to know where she is at all times, and wants to know every detail about everything, down to conversations with friends and her activities on dates, she was only just recently allowed to date.

I ask if she would just live in her mom's house once she was married, and Mia said she didn't know and laughed it off. I didn't press the issue further since I didn't want to cross a line. We moved on, when Mia's mom calls and told her to come home immediately. She didn't want Mia out so late (It was 6:30). So we leave, and she drives to drop me off, so the topic resurfaced. Mia mentions that her mom wanted her home because she was afraid that Mia was keeping things from her. I asked what she meant and she said that she had been out with her first boyfriend and kissed him. Mia said her mom was upset that she ""hid it"", telling her mom later in the day when she asked. I was really surprised, and told Mia that my mom was the total opposite, we keep our lives separate, and I don't really tell my mom that kind of stuff. I tried to word it in the best way possible that I didn't upset her. She went on to explain that her mom was really only looking out for her, and said that her mom said she didn't want Mia and her boyfriend to be romantic with eachother. 

Internally, my jaw was dropped. I really didn't know what to say, so I told her that ""At the end of the day, your life is your own, and you shouldn't let your mom influence that. I don't know the full relationship between you and your mom, but your relationship shouldn't be controlled by what she thinks-"" And Mia interrupted by saying her mom wasn't controlling. I said I misspoke and didn't mean it like that, but I could tell she was upset. I tried to make it better by apologizing if I overstepped and she didn't say anything. She changed the subject after a beat of silence, so I didn't mention it again. She dropped me off and waved goodbye with a smile as if nothing was wrong, even if she's going to tell her mom about it later. Her mom might make Mia cut me off, so it has me wondering.

1,1dxvzou,AITA for not accepting an unfinished bookshelf from my husband?,"A few months  ago I jokingly asked my husband to build me a bookshelf which he decided he wanted to do. I told him multiple times that I can just buy one and he doesn't have to make it (he's handy but hasn't never done something this big). He insisted on making it himself which I am incredibly grateful for. 

After a few weeks of working on it it's finally ""done"". But the thing is it's incredibly rough to the touch and needs to be sanded again and have another final coat put on. He didn't properly research how to apply poly. I mentioned that I looked it up and it should be sanded with another coat put on and he basically told me I'm just complaining and ungrateful. I told him I don't want to put books on it where they can rip or get damaged (many are collector's, limited edition, or signed copies), it hurts if you brush bare skin against it, and it will be impossible to clean. Am I being unreasonable for wanting him to finish the project he insisted on doing himself? Or should I just accept it how it is? I'm not handy myself and have back issues which is why I told him MANY times I could just buy one. It is a gorgeous bookshelf and exactly what I wanted other than the fact that it feels like sandpaper 

UPDATE: I just wanted to answer a few comments I keep seeing.

1. I won't be using it for something else because he put a LOT of work into it and built it custom for this area and this purpose.
2. I'm not going to hire someone else to fix it, that would be very insulting to him and I'd simply rather do it myself at that point
3. YES, I could put contact paper or something of the sort down but I simply don't want to. It is not the look I'm going for and won't stick to the surface. 
4. Everyone is being pretty harsh on him. He has built many other things but has not worked with stain and poly more than once or twice and simply didn't do the research on how to properly apply it because he didn't realize it wasn't as simple as brush it(the poly) on.
5. After a while he realized I was right and it is too rough, he realized he can pretty easily lightly sand it and I told him that if I still want a smoother finish after that I will apply another coat myself(which he would probably end up doing for me anyway).

I understand why he was frustrated because after spending weeks on this project and thinking it was finally done he learns he has more to do. It is 8 ft high, 4 ft wide and laying on the ground so his back is hurting too.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for not accepting an unfinished bookshelf from my husband?

2,1dxvvzx,AITA For asking a trans man to walk me home ,"AITA For asking a trans man to walk me home?

I 20F was invited to visit my sister 24 and friends met at University.
I knew a couple of them, and one the trans man in particular more than others, I did not know some of them.

On the second day, we had all gone out for some drinks to celebrate finishing Uni, we had eaten out during the day and I suspected I had been accidentally given some gluten/gluten cross contamination happened and so wasn’t feeling well, and was feeling worse as the time went on.
I have an intolerance, so I was NOT in danger, just feeling nauseous with stomach pain/cramps.

One of her friends I’ll call him Alex 25ish, seems to like me, and had been trying to flirt despite me telling him I wasn’t interested.

I said I was going to walk back to their apartment where I was staying as I wasn’t feeling well, I knew roughly where we were and where I needed to go, and was happy to go alone (maybe 10 minutes walk) I also had my phone with google maps if I needed it.

Alex immediately wanted to walk me home, and I tried to gently say I was fine he could stay and have fun etc.

Her trans friend Liam 23, then offered and said he was tired anyway.

I felt more comfortable with Liam as I knew him far better, and he wasn’t continually flirting making me uncomfortable.

I accepted Liam’s offer and we left, Alex was visibly annoyed and tried to make me change me mind or let him come too.
We insisted we were fine and then a couple others came over to find him so he left.
Liam did return to the party a while later.

Well, apparently I caused issues.
Being more comfortable with Liam is “transphobic as I don’t perceive him as a real man and therefore also a danger”
And I “put him in danger”.

There’s been a lot of back and forth over similar points, there’s a rift in my sisters friend group and half are angry at me.
Sis isn’t sure who to side with, and is t sure what happened exactly as she wasn’t there at the time of the conversation.

3,1dxvqvb,AITA for solving a problem?,"So, 3 months ago I [F27] had this idea of organizing a vacation for a group of 12 people. I created a team in messenger and invited 12 people (friends of mine and my husband's [M26] to a certain location. 
It took us some time to be ready about the specifics and the location wasnt available anymore. Everybody agreed on looking for another location which we did eventually and two of my husband's friends decided to book the place. They gave us time until Tuesday to answer a messenger poll and the next day they would call the place.
One of our friends bailed out and one of my friends who hadn't given a straight answer yet, forgot to answer the poll so they didn't include her in the booking. 
When we realized the mix up, I asked the one who booked the place to call the owner and inform him about being 11 people and not 12. If the price would change, my friend would pay the difference. Keep in mind it was two villas, able to house 6 people each. 
He immediately refused claiming the price he ""negotiated"" was strictly for 10 people and nothing could be done. We asked him nicely to give it a try and make the call but he refused even harder, talking about how it was he who organized the whole thing and she shouldn't forgotten about answering the poll and it has been months my friend knew about the vacation and didn't give a straight answer. 
I asked for the telephone number to call myself but he still refused. I informed him that I would find the phone in google and that I only called him because he was the one who already talked with the place. 
I found the phone, I called, and the owner told me that it didn't matter how many of us would be as long as we weren't over 6 people in the villa. I offered to pay more and he told me the price is the same either we were 8 people or 12 people. As long as we are not more. 
When I anounced that the problem is solved, he and another one of his friends got so mad at me that almost cancelled the vacation. I couldn't understand what the problem was and their answers were the following : 
- How dare you call the owner while I was the one that did the booking?
- You should be ashamed of what you did 
- We gave time till Tuesday and she never answered, she shouldn't come. 
- We could have invited other friends of ours to the vacation but we didn't because they didn't answer on time. Why should she come as she didn't answer on time ?

8,1dyo5u3,AITA for utting on careless whisper when my flatmate had a girl over,"
I (20F) live with two guys (24 and 29) in a shared flat for about 6 months now. We have ground rules about noise after 11pm as we all either work or study. 

So one of them (29M) shares a wall with me and we've had problems about noise before, he'd wake me up in the middle of the night or just like let me not sleep in general. Tonight, he had a girl over. I saw her before going to bed myself at around midnight. 

I managed to get around 30mins of sleep before I started hearing everything. It was 00:50 at the time. I was kinda baffled cuz my other flatmate (24M) had told me about the previous girlfriend and how the girl that was in my room before me (24F) would hear them all the time. 

Anyways its was getting around 1:20 am and I was getting sick of not being able to sleep. With the endless support of my friend whom I was texting through this whole ordeal I did the unthinkable. I put on Careless Whisper at max volume. Its almost 2am now and they are silent.

It was the George Michael version for anybody curious ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for utting on careless whisper when my flatmate had a girl over 
I (20F) live with two guys (24 and 29) in a shared flat for about 6 months now. We have ground rules about noise after 11pm as we all either work or study. 

So one of them (29M) shares a wall with me and we've had problems about noise before, he'd wake me up in the middle of the night or just like let me not sleep in general. Tonight, he had a girl over. I saw her before going to bed myself at around midnight. 

I managed to get around 30mins of sleep before I started hearing everything. It was 00:50 at the time. I was kinda baffled cuz my other flatmate (24M) had told me about the previous girlfriend and how the girl that was in my room before me (24F) would hear them all the time. 

Anyways its was getting around 1:20 am and I was getting sick of not being able to sleep. With the endless support of my friend whom I was texting through this whole ordeal I did the unthinkable. I put on Careless Whisper at max volume. Its almost 2am now and they are silent. 

I don't exactly regret it but I feel bad for ruining his night. But I also had a terrible day and I really didn't want to continue listening to them like that... and also now I cant go to sleep and I hate that too.

9,1dyo3q4,AITA for not sharing the same bar of soap with family? ,"
I (17F) have recently moved with my family to a new house. Previously, my siblings used the downstairs shower while I used the upstairs one, so we never had to share a shower. However, in this new house, we all have to share the same shower. 

One day, I grabbed a bar of soap to use, and my mom stopped me, saying, “There’s already a bar of soap in the shower.” But I feel like using the same bar of soap as my siblings isn’t sanitary. I told my mom, “But it’s not clean,” and she looked at me like I was crazy and accused me of calling my siblings dirty.

The thing is, they kind of are dirty. My brother rarely showers and often smells awful, and my sister doesn’t shower much either. Both of my siblings have some form of autism, which might affect their hygiene habits. Additionally, I’m pretty sure I have some form of OCD, which makes me particularly sensitive to issues of cleanliness and sanitation.

Because of these factors, I just can’t bring myself to use the same bar of soap that my siblings use. I know it’s just soap, but the thought of sharing it makes me very uncomfortable. My mom doesn’t seem to understand this and thinks I’m being unreasonable or judgmental towards my siblings. 

I’m not trying to be mean or imply that my siblings are disgusting; I just have a strong aversion to sharing personal hygiene items. I feel like I should be allowed to have my own bar of soap to use, especially considering my mental health and cleanliness concerns.

So, am I the AITA for not wanting to share the same bar of soap as my siblings? I’m struggling with whether my concerns are valid or if I’m being overly sensitive and difficult. Any advice or perspectives on this situation would be greatly appreciated.",No A-holes here,2024-07-08,"AITA for not sharing the same bar of soap with family?

10,1dynz3r,WIBTA for giving my friend relationship advice?,"My friend Brooke, (17F) got into a serious relationship with Rick, (18M), after knowing him for just two weeks. Me and our mutual friend, Sarah (both 14F) have always given Brooke advice in the past, and she has taken it. However, when we expressed our concerns about Rick, we told Brooke that he might try to isolate her from her friends, and tell her we were toxic. I was jokingly texting Rick from Brooke's phone things like ""Hey its (my name), your a loser!! you and your beautiful eyelashes need to get outta here!!"" you know, obviously joking stuff. This was my first interaction with Rick and, admittedly, my jokes were maybe too sarcastic for an over the phone first impression, but instead of trying to understand my POV or talking with Brooke about it constructively, he threatened their relationship, saying I was petty and toxic and that Brooke needed to pick me or him. Sarah and I decided we needed to talk to her about Rick and try to understand what was going on and if our friendship was at risk, when we did she said Rick was afraid I would jump him, which is literally impossible. Brooke also revealed that Rick was making ultimatums and talking bad about Sarah and I during a trip about 1 1/2 months later where Rick was very clingy with Brooke, texting her 24/7. Brooke agreed to talk to Rick about our concerns, but we are unsure if it will make a difference given Rick has done this before and obviously not changed. Main question: should I expect a change or just stop waiting for one? or another option lol.

EDIT: I understand how I may seem very full of myself, but please believe me when I say, my friend is ignoring tons of red flags.

12,1dynnzt,AITA for being distant from my mom after she suggested kicking me out the house? ,"About a week ago, I had a bad day (worked a long shift, and got pulled over the way home for not stopping completely as a stop sign- my bad. Anyways). At the end of the day, about 10pm, my mom was on the phone with my sister and I and she was getting on my case that I hadn't single done every single one of the chores she requested. I said I had a long day (in not the nicest tone) and I was not having the conversation right now (for reference my mom was with my dad five hours away). I left the room. This really pissed her off and she went crazy. She... 

1. took away my money for rent for the next month (that is from my GRANDPA not her she doesn't work) 

2. suggested to my sister to kick me out of the house

3. threatened to block me 

4. threatened to hire someone to do the chores and force me to pay (when I had already agreed to doing them) 

I was appalled by this behavior. I refused to beg for the money back, I told my dad that I would call my grandparents and tell them that Mom is withholding money from me. My dad didn't want to do that, so later the next day I had a FaceTime call with my mom and dad. I felt very attacked and disrespected, my Mom did not apologize for her immature behavior, all she wanted to do was go on and on about my ""disrespectful tone"" even after I repeatedly apologized. She also seemed to almost be holding it over my head that I'm living in the house for the summer and that I need groceries... like you signed up to have a child? they're not gonna be financially independent at age 20. Then my Mom said she would give the money back and had no real intention of permanently taking it, she essentially was trying to manipulate and scare me. 

I don't have issues with my Dad, he sent me an encouraging text the other day it's mostly my Mom. Unfortunately my mom has come home and I can't help but feel cold to her. I'm not mad at her and I'm trying to forgive her, but I don't really have a desire to see her or talk to her. When the family is together and they're all happy I can't help but want to leave because of her. Am I being unreasonable or petty? The funny thing is this whole argument started from nothing anyway.

13,1dynmea,AITA For being upset for plan changes with my best friend. ," 
 
(23m) and my best friend( 20f)ade plans for this forth of July. First the plan was going swimming ( that was what I was looking forward to the most because I haven't gotten to go swimming yet.) and go her her father's for lunch. She lives 3 hours away where I use to live also my parents live there. I told my parents that id be down. And come back that Friday morning . My mother offers to make us dinner and banana ice cream. I told her the plan and asked if she would like to do that and maybe see fireworks after. She agreed that would work .

Later I told her how my mom wants me to get up early to help me clean out my car so I told her I would meet her at the pool and I'll just go to my mom's early and meet her there.

The day I got there and I drove down was fine when she got there she said she want to go to a friend's house and that I probably wanted to go to bed and that's fine. Even mentioned that she wanted to see her family who's coming in from New Jersey and that heard some friends want to do a game night later that day. I said cool that's fine we'll find a way to put it all in and then she went out and I went to bed. 

She came back at 10:00 in the morning and hasn't slept she said she was going to get 2 hours of sleep I was like okay I also went back to sleep . You woke up and I tried talking to her about the plans I was like okay how do you want to do this I was trying to be conscientious of both things we want to do and trying to figure it all out and it can all fit . She was like oh well we can't go swimming always too close together. I was visibly upset and yes slightly pouting because I really wanted to go to pool that day and it was one of the main reasons she invited me . I didn't say anything else after that I was kind of just keeping to myself / pouting. I didn't know how to say or what to say without making her up more upset so I just didn't say anything. I later went to my parents house and decided that I wanted at least tell her how I felt. The following are the messages that were sent between me and her these are the only other conversation we had we didn't speak in person at all. 

Me-Look Lexi . I'm pissed ok. You invited me down here specifically to go swimming and hang out so yea I'm mad I wanted to hang out with you but you changed our plans . I know you wanna see your family but I drove 3 hours to see and be with you so when you change the plans we had to go to your family and not hang with me it made me upset 

Her- Alright. I'm not doing this with you. I already told you I'm probably NOT GOING to GET to go see my family from out of town because of the plans with your mom. I said I would have to cancel on them to hang out with you at your moms house. 

I didn't invite you down JUST TO GO SWIMMING. I invited you down to spend time with you whatever that was doing it. 

PLUS if you wanna use that logic the original plan included you coming down and I said my dad would grill and we could go swimming after. YOU made plans with your mom.

You're acting like a toddler throwing a tantrum because you didn't get to go swimming. I haven't actually had a tantrum over something as little as this in YEARS. As should be the case for you, but no you're 23 and still throwing tantrums. 

I'm not doing this. It's ridiculous. Pack your stuff up and leave. I'm not listening to the complaining all dang night. 

Furthermore, I was having concerns about my birthday. Worried you would pull little stunts such as this episode.  I was gonna wait until after today to see, and you have absolutely confirmed it. 
You are not invited to my birthday. 

Just leave. I can't do it with you anymore. I'm supposed to be your friend, not your babysitter and that's genuinely how it feels. Just leave.

Me - Look Lexi , I'm sorry you felt this way but clearly we got our wires crossed . When you said your father didn't plan for me to come I was like ok because I didn't want to intrude .  I'm not acting like a child . I was upset and didn't know how to say it when we where at the apartment. So I texted you so you knew how I felt . I was trying to make concessions and make it where we both get to do what we wanted to do. You agreed to the plan last week so it was my thought that that was the plan. Then you threw in your other family and the game night with your friends and I was cool with it . I was trying to compromise . It's upsetting that you fling these insults at me when I'm trying to mature about this. 

Her-My dad didn't plan for you to come because YOU told me you were going to your moms early this morning. So he only thought I was coming and then going to your mom's tonight. 

And no you sat there and pouted about not being able to go swimming. Pouted. Literally. No exaggeration. 

And yea the plan last week was that I was going to my dad's around noon. Then we were going to your mom's around 5. In between us talking my bio dad's mom texted me and told me they were gonna be in town and they wanted to see me. Seeing as you made plans with your mom after i go hang with my dad, I knew there would be no time for swimming so I figured I could swing by there and say hey. 

And I just so happened to have victoria the friend want to do something tonight because she's been out of town for school living in alabama. I was offering for you to come hang out with us so we could have a good time. 

But see you don't think logically. You think ""me me me"" Everything wasn't about you today, so you pitched a fit! 

The stuff I said doesn't JUST have to do with today Daniel. Open your eyes. This is me finally saying stuff I have held back ever since you were living in that first apartment in Timber Creek. I can't do it anymore. And I'm not arguing with you. Because one thing about. you is that you always have to be right. And I'm not fighting that. Just please leave me be. I am tired and not doing this today. I don't wanna deal with the bs.

Me-Fine Lexi you know what  I'm done trying to be the mature one and get called a child when I'm trying to make consensus and figure this out but clearly you don't . I forgive you but this clearly isn't working. If you wanna try to figure it out sometime in the future I'm fine with that but it's clearly not happening today.

I love my dad but he has been a jerk to my mom before, once he took her to court to gain sole custody of me, I was maybe 5 at the time. This lays the groundwork for my mom’s hesitation in signing this document. 

In me and my dads country you can’t be abroad for over 6 months, & so now that I am back for the summer we essentially have to move me back into the country so that I can leave again once I have to go back to the US for school. Or at least that’s the explanation that he gave me. Now some of what he said is true, but mostly it’s because the govt. won’t give him child support if I am not in the country, & for some weird reason he is obsessed with getting the money. 

I don’t really care & neither does my mom as long as he is happy. My dad has a well paying job, so I don’t know why he wants the money so badly. 

To prove that I am “moving back” my mom has to sign a document saying that she is aware & consents to the move. My mom does NOT want to sign this document as it could be used against her, if my dad would ever want full custody, as she is (according to her) signing away her rights to me. 

I think this is stupid as I turn 18 in a year & who would want to have custody of a soon to be adult? I understand where her fear comes from, but I think that she should just sign it. 

She has also argued that it would be deceiving the govt. as when school starts again they can see that I am not enrolled anywhere in the country & that I am in the US. 

My mom dreams of retiring to my country &  she doesn’t want this to hinder her opportunity (she has tried two times before). 

My dad also thinks that it is stupid & today they talked over face time & things got very heated. They started yelling at each other, & it ended by my dad saying that he is entitled to the money & that if he doesn’t get it from the govt. then he wants my mom to pay it. She of course said no, & that she shouldn’t have to do that. 

He ended up hanging up, & then he wrote her an email saying that he wouldn’t help her with flying me back to the US & that she would have to tell me that I am not going back. 
I asked her not to tell me anything about their conversation, but she texted me telling me to hide my passport. Which then prompted me to ask her why.

15,1dynhxp,AITA for being jealous of how my sister was always the favorite?,"Throwaway account just in case my parents or sister find this.

I grew up as the younger child (crazy how I got less attention despite the stereotypes lol) while my sister was the oldest. I'm going to be honest, growing up was rough my parents didn't really have the most money and they were always really cheap for everything. Despite that they always got my sister what she wanted over me.

When we were quite young, we got our own cell phones. I would use a hand me down iPhone 4 while my sister got a brand-new iPhone 8. When we moved into a new home my sister got her own room while I had to sleep on the floor with my mother (which I feel doesn't make much since as I'm a male and my sister, well a female and I feel like it just makes much more sense for people with the same gender to stay together). When she first started high school they got her a new mac while I used a computer that was made the same year I was born, even though I was always interested programming, video games, building computers, and my sister couldn't give a shit about what she used. I always did all the chores, helped my parents with their business, helped setup everything in the house while my sister just sat there and did nothing. During summer I would help my parents out while my sister would hang out with her friends.

Fast forward a couple of years and my sister is permitted to go move to another country to go to a college she likes. They pay for her living, food, got her a new phone, and all of her expenses. While I still have a junk phone that they took away for the summer, and to add fuel to fire they took $3000 from me which I earned from a coding project I did online via crypto which I really don't think will be returned. I also recently asked my mother if I would be able to go to a college that I choose, and she told me I am only permitted to go within our city because she's ""learned her mistake"" from my sister doing poor in school now.

AITA for being just slightly upset how I was treated? I appreciate my parents for taking care of me and making sure I never starved, and I love my sister, but I just feel like I was never really a loved child, and I was like a foster kid.

16,1dynb1d,WIBTA for not critiquing?,"I (18M) recently revised a small story that my friend ""Arthur"" (19M) turned in for his creative writing assignment at a college. The story was okay, it was about a family exploring an abandoned house on their property and realizing that they were making the same mistakes as the family who lived in that house before. Today he got it back and one of the main concerns from the professor was that ""It's so unrealistic to have people say 'Big Bro and Big sis' in conversation even when exploring"". Because of comments like that he got a B instead of an A.

Arthur asked me if that stood out to him when I was reading and I told him honestly no. I'm half filipino so I hear my mom calling her older siblings 'Ate' if they're a girl and 'Kuya' if they're a boy. He's white and apparently the professor is too so Arthur said ""If you knew that about your culture why didn't you explain taht to me so I could explain it to my professor?""

It got into a circular argument where I didn't think that mentioning my culture was important in the critique as much as he wanted it to be. I told him that he should find someone else but he said that his final is due next week and he wanted me to critique it. I felt like if he gets negative critiques again he'd use that as an excuse to say that my mom's culture isn't realistic.

A few years ago I blocked her from all social media due to her constant inappropriate comments on my pictures and open channel to guilt tripping DMs. After sometime she promised to stop the behavior and so she was allowed on this Instagram account where I’m barely active and can control what I share with my family. 

A couple of days ago, I received four back-to-back notifications on Instagram from my mother commenting on old pictures.

But then,  She called me right away, and after we finished the call, she texted me that she was glad I finally called her. (Didn’t she said the calls weren’t going through?!)

hey guys,

so my best friend (referring to her as Grace for the sake of this story) has been dating a new guy for the past couple months (referring to his as Mark.) as a friend group in general, we take many vacations together; and as a friend, i feel like it is also my responsibility to include Mark as Grace often tells me that she loves her boyfriend, but feels bad for him due to his lack of friends. he is very shy, but a nice person overall.

this year, as a friend group, we’ve taken 3 or 4 trips, and normally i am tasked with planning them. i find a hotel, cross check the price with everyone before booking, and after get paid by everyone relatively quickly.

my problem has arose that Mark cannot afford these trips, and commits to them without having the money to pay for it. as a student, i can understand taking a few days to gather the funds, but typically if that is the issue i either DON’T commit to the plan, or speak with someone before any money is put down. he has screwed me over numerous times leaving me without 100-200 dollars, for weeks, the longest time period being 3 months.

as a college student, i understand the financial struggle, however all these trips and there prices are communicated before booking, when everyone gives the okay. when i pay for these things out of my pocket, in turn i struggle financially when even one member of the group fails to contribute their 100-200 dollars until months after the event passes.

i tried to speak to Grace about this, as she always pushes for Mark to join, and let her know that while id love to have him come, i am not in a situation to front someone that big of amount of money, she in turn got super upset with me, told me i was selfish, and said it was jealousy issue. this is not the case for me at all, but rather that i cannot front Mark for vacations anymore, especially when I see him travel to Europe, but neglect to pay me for a trip we took a month ago.

i know the easy thing to say is to stop booking trips period, but truth be told is that everyone pays me quickly except Mark because we communicate over it, and i have just always been given the planner role.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for telling my best friend I can’t front her boyfriend money for our group trips?

21,1dymq8p,AITA for not making a guest room for my parents?,"My wife and i grew up in the same neighborhood, and my folks still live there. We lived in that same area for years after we got married, but we bought a small house and moved to a different state (although it's only an hour away) a few years ago.

My folks and I aren't that close, but they love to see my kids, so we would visit maybe every 6-8 weeks. We have a room on our second floor that's small and really a study/storage room, but there's a twin bed and we use it for guests sometimes. The thing is, my dad has a bad knee and can't make it up the stairs.

Since we moved, my siblings, who my parents have always been closer with, moved out of the country, so my parents have been trying to spend more time with us, and my mom has been trying to convince us to turn our den into a guest bedroom for them. I don't want to do this. She's offered to pay for expenses but it would still be a huge pain, we use the room, and, frankly, I don't want my parents staying over all the time, which is clearly there goal.

My parents have an incredibly toxic relationship. My Dad berates my mom all the time for nonsense (buying the wrong brand of soap, under seasoning food, whatever) and my mom insults hom to others behind his back. My mom also makes very unhealthy comments about people's bodies and eating habits constantly and endlessly shares other people's private information. My dad is extremely political and loves shoving his views down other's throats, referring to those who disagree as morons, to put it politely, and often uses hateful language about ethnic groups.

Overall, I just find them unpleasant and unhealthy to be around and I don't like the idea of my kids spending too much time with them.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for not making a guest room for my parents? My wife and i grew up in the same neighborhood, and my folks still live there. We lived in that same area for years after we got married, but we bought a small house and moved to a different state (although it's only an hour away) a few years ago.

My folks and I aren't that close, but they love to see my kids, so we would visit maybe every 6-8 weeks. We have a room on our second floor that's small and really a study/storage room, but there's a twin bed and we use it for guests sometimes. The thing is, my dad has a bad knee and can't make it up the stairs.

Since we moved, my siblings, who my parents have always been closer with, moved out of the country, so my parents have been trying to spend more time with us, and my mom has been trying to convince us to turn our den into a guest bedroom for them. I don't want to do this. She's offered to pay for expenses but it would still be a huge pain, we use the room, and, frankly, I don't want my parents staying over all the time, which is clearly there goal.

My parents have an incredibly toxic relationship. My Dad berates my mom all the time for nonsense (buying the wrong brand of soap, under seasoning food, whatever) and my mom insults hom to others behind his back. My mom also makes very unhealthy comments about people's bodies and eating habits constantly and endlessly shares other people's private information. My dad is extremely political and loves shoving his views down other's throats, referring to those who disagree as morons, to put it politely, and often uses hateful language about ethnic groups.

I (M) am currently very happy in a relationship (5+ years now). I have had a female friend for almost as long which as far as I was aware was nothing more than a friendship. I found out recently that this girl has been into me for possibly a couple of months but never really showed anything out of respect for me and my partner. Nothing has ever crossed my mind that they were into me. 

Fast forward to today, we spoke and I let her know that I appreciate her coming forward and being open with how she felt however I didn’t want her to feel like something could ever be there as I am happy in my current relationship. This upset her a lot as she genuinely believed there was a connection there but was always too shy to come forward about it. For context she had not always felt this way, it  has only been over the last couple of months that she has started to feel this way. I can tell she is hurt and for some reason I feel awful. Someone I have had such a good friendship with for quite some time now could possibly be gone just like that.

I spoke to my partner about it to be open and honest about the whole situation as I feel it’s important that she is aware of it. It came as quite a shock to her and now she is uneasy and upset with me. I believe this is down the the uncertainty of what she thinks was going on behind her back (not that anything ever did)

For some reason I feel like an asshole for leading this girl on without being aware I was doing it - even though I believe I’ve done the right thing? 


TDLR: in a relationship for 5 years. A good friend of mine let me know she likes me. I let her down gently and now she is upset with me. Partner also upset at the situation

This year i spent almost 2k on four early acess tickets for my boyfriend (melem 21M) , my other friend (alyssa 19F) and her now ex boyfriend ( harold 20 M) (fake names.) 

So around a month ago alyssa called me at midnight to come over and comfort her bc her harold left her at home alone to go to the bars with a bunch of people. I ofc said yes ill come over. When i arrived she asked me to speak to harold when he gets back about how he is treating her. And again i said yes i will. When he got home he arrived with 5+ extra people. I asked harold if we could speak outside. He said yes. So we head outside to speak in private. I told him that he needs to treat her better because I shouldnt be over there at midnight playing boyfriend. He got a smirk on his face and starting saying some random stuff. It was very ego filled and i told him honestly if i was alyssa i would have left him months ago. (Keep in mind harold always compares himself to my boyfriend melem). He didnt like that i said that and slammed his way into his house and yells at alyssa to pack her shit and get tf out. Keep in mind, infront of all these random people. I call melem to come pick me and alyssa up bc i know where this is going. Melem is on the way so i head back inside. When i get inside melem is screaming in alyssas face and i step between them to try to calm down the situation. He gets in my face, also to mention. He is 6’4? And huge. I am 4’11. So i get pissed bc i am not going to let any man scream in my face. I tell him to stop. He yells more and people come back inside. Blah blah melem comes and gets us. I ended up slamming a girls head into a wall bc she picks me up to move me???? So after alyssa and i leave. Harold is on a rampage about how i ruined his relationship etc. 

Now alyssa broke up with harold. I kept myself out of it after that bc i didn’t want to be involved in the first place. The last time i saw this happen was with my best friend who died bc her psycho ex drove drunk and killex her.

Now alyssa is speaking to harold again. Harold made to clear he doesnt like me and thinks i ruinec his relationship. I get why he is mad keep in mind, im whatever. He tells alyssa he isnt going to greyday.  Fine, i dont want him to go. 

Recently i asked my friend (kelsie) to take his place at the concert. Everyone was cool with it. I did not mention it to harold because why would i want to speak to him?? He is still talking about me etc. he tried to speek to melem about me and melem shut him down. 

So i booked the hotel today. Kelsie is paying half of the hotel. Alyssa hasnt paid me anything. I told alyssa i booked the hotel and she said i need to speak to harold and tell him he isnt going.

I get that they have a connection to that place, but it's like they can't stop talking about it.

The other day, I finally had enough and told them to move on from elementary school. I said they should live their lives without constantly reminding themselves of memories they'll never experience again. I thought that would make them realize how annoying it is, but instead, it made it worst.

Bert and Matt started attacking me, bringing up this old incident where I called one of my friends harry gay. I had apologized for it 2 years ago when it happened, and he had forgiven me. But now, they're using it against me, making it seem like I'm a terrible person. The whole group chat turned against me, and I ended up leaving because I couldn't deal with the hate anymore.

I had planned a romantic proposal at our favorite spot, a secluded beach where we had our first date. I had everything ready: flowers, a small picnic, and a photographer hiding nearby to capture the moment.

When the day came, my sister (32F) insisted on tagging along. She said she wanted to take a few ""candid"" photos of us before the proposal. I was hesitant but agreed, thinking it might make the moment more special. Big mistake.

As we reached the spot, my sister started acting weird, making snarky comments and trying to direct the whole scene like a movie. My girlfriend could sense something was off, and the mood was getting ruined. Then, out of nowhere, my sister grabbed the ring box from my pocket and yelled, ""Surprise! Look what he's going to do!"" My girlfriend was shocked, and I was furious.

I managed to salvage the proposal somewhat, but the moment was tainted. My girlfriend said yes, but we both felt the proposal was ruined. Later, I confronted my sister, and she just laughed it off, saying she was ""just trying to help"" and that I was overreacting.

Fast forward to our wedding planning, and my fiancée and I decided not to invite my sister. We wanted our day to be about us, without any unnecessary drama.

	2.	This wasn’t the first time she’s crossed the line with me. When I got my first big promotion, she announced she was pregnant at the same party, only to later admit she was joking. At another family event, she spiked the punch with alcohol knowing I was on medication that strictly prohibited drinking.

So one day me and J was talking then J brought up that she was talking to that mutual about my love life and so I just cut to chase and asked her if she was interested in me. She want me to go first and I said that I wasn’t looking for a relationship and I only thought of her as a friend until the mutual told me about J said so I asked her if she liked me. J told me that she needed to get to know me more and I said the same thing but I still let her know that I’m not in a rush to get into a relationship but I’m still willing to get to know her to see where it goes. After that, our mutuals keep putting it in her head that I like her when I told her how I feel. So now she’s waiting for me to make the first movie and I don’t know what to do. We’re trying to align our schedules to where we can watch a movie on our off day but besides that, that’s it. So AITA for leading her on without trying to? I don’t want to hurt her feelings because she is kind of a bit too fast for me but I thought that I already made my feelings known.",1.0,1.0276352167129517,1,1
31,1dym4fx,WIBTA for not telling my newly discovered cousin that her father is dying?,"I took an dna test a few years ago, and last month I noticed a new, 12% dna match on the company’s site, indicating a first cousin. I didn’t recognize the name, and I have a relatively small extended family (only 8 known first cousins). Based on the dna profile, I figured out that this person had to be from my father’s side of her family 

I asked my father and aunt (with whom I’m very close) if they knew anything about another cousin, and they said no and encouraged me to message this person. 

She responded right away, and said that she was in fact the biological child of my uncle, the brother of my father and aunt. She said she hasn’t been in contact with this uncle in many years, but knew some details about him, including the name of his son. She was very curious to know more about the family, and had taken the test in order to learn about her heritage and biological family.

Now the hitch: this aforementioned uncle is in hospice care, and has perhaps a month or so to live. He has never mentioned the existence of this daughter to anyone in the family as far as I know. 

My uncle was not a wealthy man, but he prudently bought property a number of years ago that’s appreciated considerably in value, and his sole acknowledged son stands to inherit more than $1 million. 

I am not close with this uncle, and my father and aunt have been making provisions for him and taking care of him as the end of approaches. Upon telling the story to my father and aunt they agreed that I should not reach out to this newfound cousin for fear of upsetting my uncle and for fear of complicating the will process. Additionally, my father does not want to talk to his brother about this, concerned about upsetting him in his final dates. He feels that my uncle kept this secret for a reason.

WIBTA for withholding this information from my cousin? And conversely, WIBTA for disobeying my father? I’ve never met her, I have no idea of her motives, and telling could lead to a total maelstrom of problems. But I feel awful not telling her.

32,1dym1h7,AITA for being late few minutes,"Me and my boyfriend live in different countries in europe. I was visiting him and was WFH from his place while he was at work. We planned to go to the store to get food after work and he was supposed to pick me up when he was close by. I wasnt done working so i wasnt sure if i was going but i agreed in the last 10 minutes. 5 minutes before arrival he texted me again specifying to not be late. Then 3 minutes before arrival he said he will be outside in 3 minutes, but i decided to pee before going out so i was late 3 minutes. He waited for me 3 minutes extra before i got to his car. He got angry and shouted at me for not respecting his time. We were going to his friends store where we were getting fresh food, so he also said we are disrespectful to his friend because he told him we will be there at X time but now we are gonna be late ( it was nowhere near store closing time and his friend didnt care). We had a big argument about this and this was about 3 months ago. The same thing happened today. I am visiting him again and we had the same plan just regular store this time. He told me, 20 minutes before he got there, he will text me 2 mins upfront which i was okay with because i had time to get ready. He texted go and i put my shoes on, went to get a bag for groceries (which i remembered to do just then), locked the door and went down the stairs of his building. He lives on the third floor. I went to the car and i was greeted with yelling that i am late. I checked my phone and i was 1 minute late. He said go at 18:33 and my phone showed 18:36. He got really angry and he yelled at me but i told him 1 minute is not worth to get that angry about. We are writing this together, and he says it wasn't 1 minute it was atleast 2. My point is that if i made him wait for more than 5 minutes then i am the asshole, but it was 3 minutes and 1 minute because i went to pee and i went to get a bag.

33,1dym1av,AITA for telling my mom that she should back off and respect my sister’s wedding plans after she demanded a wedding? ,"Hi Reddit, I see a lot of wedding drama posts on here so it gives me hope that you all can weigh in here. I will be changing everyone’s name out of privacy concerns but buckle up and sorry it’s long. 

I (23F) have an older sister named C (29F) who just got engaged to her fiancée F (30M) less than a week ago. The entire family is incredibly happy for them and we think they are perfect for each other but here’s where everything is going to shit. C and F are adamant about not having a wedding and have said outright that they would like to elope. They would rather take the money for a wedding and use it to travel to Japan for their honeymoon, which me and my other siblings are fully supportive of. However, our mother found that totally unacceptable. She became incredibly agitated and confronted me and my other siblings and told us that we needed to convince C to have a wedding. We asked her why she couldn’t just accept and respect that it wasn’t her relationship, that it’s not her wedding to plan, and that they’re only days into their engagement and should just be enjoying their time together but she refused to listen. I told C that our mom was demanding to know her wedding plans and demanding that they have a ceremony so she texted our mom privately and told her that there was no timeline and that if any wedding plans changed C would let our mom know herself. 

Now for some background: My mom got pregnant with C at 19 and never got to have a wedding because she was paying for custody battles with her biological father. She had a civil ceremony with no witnesses at the court house with my dad. She frequently laments about not having a “proper” wedding.

Now, here is where I have a problem. when we asked her why she was demanding a wedding she said word for word “she took away my opportunity to have my own wedding. She owes me this wedding and I will not have her take it away from me twice.” She believes that because she got pregnant with C and had to pay for custody battles, it’s C’s fault she never had a wedding. We were utterly horrified. C never asked to be born, our mom made the decision to keep her (though we love that she did keep her), and it wasn’t her fault that our mom and her biological dad split. We think it’s completely insane and out of line to demand a wedding from C based on her own life decisions. We got into a huge argument because I told her that she needs to back off and stop meddling in the wedding planning. AITA? Do I need to be more understanding that she didn’t get to have a wedding?

Since she has access to ever students information, she has always been able to see what kind of grades I’m making and she can see how my classes are going. This hasn’t been helpful because she would constantly call me or text me to get work done. Mind you, all of my classes were online (I’m not the type of person that can learn online) and I was also working two jobs at that point. It was really stressing me out but everytime I told her she said I was overreacting or being sensitive.

She has also been telling anyone that will listen that she is ready to see me gone. For some context, my mom and I have always had a relationship like oil and water.

36,1dylq43,AITA for cancelling my bfs sibling bonding time?,"My boyfriend has 4 siblings, 3 of which are married, and 1 is single. 1 married couple lives outside of the country, they aren’t relevant to this story. 

Bfs family has an annual camping trip and last year was the first time they restarted it after covid and I was invited to go. It was myself, boyfriend, SIL1 BIL1 and their toddler, SIL2 and BIL2 and their 2 toddlers, BIL3 and his then GF. 

I grew up quite sheltered and this was my first time camping, so maybe I was just naive - but the trip was horrible. All activities had to be done as a group, but were dependent on the toddlers schedule. The first day the entire day was wasted because the kids weren’t napping properly or were being fussy. The second day, lunch was delayed so naps were delayed which led to less time at the lake. The third day, the kids were better - but the entire trip had been soured and no one was in a good mood. In the evenings, we weren’t allowed to be “loud” (aka talk in a normal voice) after 8 pm because the babies were sleeping. Any time boyfriend and I tried to duck out and do our own thing - it was met with “wait 20 mins, we’ll join you” and then 20 mins turned to 1 hour which turned into 3 hours. 

Some other things to mention: I suffer from IBS and the anxiety of the trip and hot weather, flared up my IBS and it was brutal for me. I basically had diarrhea for the entire trip as well, so that was fun. SIL 1 also spent the entire weekend making subtle jabs at me and making jokes at my expense. This was noticed by SIL 2 who told her to stop a couple of times, but it persisted. 

This year, BF invited me on the camping trip and I declined. When he questioned why - I reminded him of last year, and also just didn’t want to risk it with my IBS. I suggested we do separate cabins instead, and I would be open to that. BF took that idea to rest of the siblings, and the married ones were not on board and shot it down immediately. 

I told BF I didn’t want to go this year, but he was welcome to go. He doesn’t want to go without me, so said he would skip it this year too. BFS brother is single and says he doesn’t want to go on the trip either if BF is not going. Now with essentially half the group backing out, I’m getting the blame for the cancellation of “sibling bonding time.” I’m getting told by SIL 1 that I’m high maintenance and should just suck it up for the group. BIL 2 is upset because he wants to spend time with BF, but I’m “blocking it.” I’m pushing BF to go so I don’t look like the bad guy - but he _also_ doesn’t want to because he didn’t have fun last year either.

37,1dylkre,AITA for blocking a longterm friend after he told his gf I was in love with him?,"I(28F)was friends with Asa(29M)for 12 years. We played pickup or hung out with the friend group. Sometimes I went to Asa's and played xbox or hung out with his sister alone. I moved away for 3 years, and we spoke every few months. I moved back 2 years ago; Asa was normal then ghosted everyone for months. Then he got drunk and told everyone I was horrible for not giving him a chance to date me. I was shocked. We spoke about it and Asa said he never asked since I didn't want to date anyone. He got drunk twice more and brought it up. I told him it's not something to discuss since I'm not interested in dating him. I distanced myself, not seeing him outside the group.

Months later I saw him and a woman eating; he made eye contact, got up and left. Another friend, Dan, was there and told me not to give it too much thought. Later Asa messaged that he's in a committed relationship and we can't be friends. That he's sorry he treated me badly but it's because he was talking to us at the same time. I replied that we never ""talked"", I don't want to date him, and I support his relationship but felt this was odd since we're in the same friend group. A few weeks later, Asa told me at an event that they broke up. He made sexual passes so I gave him a ""tf"" look and left. Months pass. I didn't reply to his texts(there weren't many, but late at night).

Then I am told by an acquaintance we can't hang out anymore since her friend, May, was dating Asa and I was the other woman. I reached out to May and assured her this wasn't true. She told me that Asa confessed who I was: we dated for years, and when Asa chose May, I wouldn't take no for an answer since I was still in love with him. May was uncomfortable and asked him to send that message. They had been dating for 2 years. When Asa texted, asking what I was talking to May about, I told him how twisted it was that he was trying to guilt me into dating him for 2 years while he had a gf the whole time. He told his gf I was lying so I said I'm removing myself from the situation and blocked him.

Months pass. I noticed others in the group canceling plans, but people are busy and I have another friend group. I saw Dan yesterday and he looked awkward, saying he didn't want to ""be in the middle of all that"" with me, Asa, and May. He was still hanging out with Asa and wouldn't choose sides. I haven't hung out lately with them, so idk what's being said, but I didn't bring this up to anyone in the friend group. I changed the topic, but Dan brought it back to Asa.

A friend of Dan's interjected and told me obviously I'm not wanted around and was embarrassing myself by being there. Dan said nothing. So I said ""okay, that's mean"" and left.

Maybe I fudged up. I just feel outcasted and blindsided. I feel I have lost a friend group. AITA for blocking Asa?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for blocking a longterm friend after he told his gf I was in love with him? I(28F)was friends with Asa(29M)for 12 years. We played pickup or hung out with the friend group. Sometimes I went to Asa's and played xbox or hung out with his sister alone. I moved away for 3 years, and we spoke every few months. I moved back 2 years ago; Asa was normal then ghosted everyone for months. Then he got drunk and told everyone I was horrible for not giving him a chance to date me. I was shocked. We spoke about it and Asa said he never asked since I didn't want to date anyone. He got drunk twice more and brought it up. I told him it's not something to discuss since I'm not interested in dating him. I distanced myself, not seeing him outside the group.

Months later I saw him and a woman eating; he made eye contact, got up and left. Another friend, Dan, was there and told me not to give it too much thought. Later Asa messaged that he's in a committed relationship and we can't be friends. That he's sorry he treated me badly but it's because he was talking to us at the same time. I replied that we never ""talked"", I don't want to date him, and I support his relationship but felt this was odd since we're in the same friend group. A few weeks later, Asa told me at an event that they broke up. He made sexual passes so I gave him a ""tf"" look and left. Months pass. I didn't reply to his texts(there weren't many, but late at night).

Then I am told by an acquaintance we can't hang out anymore since her friend, May, was dating Asa and I was the other woman. I reached out to May and assured her this wasn't true. She told me that Asa confessed who I was: we dated for years, and when Asa chose May, I wouldn't take no for an answer since I was still in love with him. May was uncomfortable and asked him to send that message. They had been dating for 2 years. When Asa texted, asking what I was talking to May about, I told him how twisted it was that he was trying to guilt me into dating him for 2 years while he had a gf the whole time. He told his gf I was lying so I said I'm removing myself from the situation and blocked him.

Months pass. I noticed others in the group canceling plans, but people are busy and I have another friend group. I saw Dan yesterday and he looked awkward, saying he didn't want to ""be in the middle of all that"" with me, Asa, and May. He was still hanging out with Asa and wouldn't choose sides. I haven't hung out lately with them, so idk what's being said, but I didn't bring this up to anyone in the friend group. I changed the topic, but Dan brought it back to Asa.

39,1dyli8j,AITA for asking my friends mom to reimburse me for the locksmith I had to pay for because they didn't tell me the door was gonna lock behind me??,"I 23F and my friend 23F have been friends for a while. We'll call her Faith. We'll call her mom Sticky. Sticky and Faith are going to Italy. They ask me if I want to housesit and take care of their two cats while they're away. They are both gone from the 5th - 17th.  I started staying with them about week prior. Neither one of them mentions to me that their front door will lock behind you if you close it. Anytime I've left the house and the door locks one of them was home and I assumed they locked it behind me. I never gave it a second thought because they have always been anal about this, being two ladies living alone. I've moved houses many times in my life and I've never had a front door that will do that to me. So, this wasn't common knowledge for me. My front door locks only when I lock it.

You can probably guess what happened, i walked out to water the plants and close the door behind me so the cats don’t get out. I lock myself out with my phone and keys inside. I start to panic. I walk over to a neighbors house so I can use their phone to contact Faith and Sticky. Thankfully, the neighbor did have Sticky's phone # but it's about 3pm where I'm at and like 4am in Italy. The neighbor leaves me his work phone to continue to try and contact them.

By 8pm I finally get ahold of Faith and Sticky and they don't have a spare hidden. Apparently Papa (Faith's gpa) was suppose to pick up the spare (thats currently inside the house) so some1 nearby would have it. Also, Faith and Sticky are not happy on the phone. This is an annoying situation for sure, but they are talking to me like I've made the stupidest mistake and are majorly inconvenienced by the sleep interruption. I was a little taken aback that they were talking to me like this, they didn't even ask how I was being the one who was stuck outside for hours trying to fix it all because they didn't tell me about the door... But I didn't say anything. It's also my pov that it was Sticky's responsibility to check all her boxes to avoid putting me in this situation. Yes I am an adult, but she should've told me things like this I needed to know about the house and make sure that Papa had that key. Right?

After being locked out for about 5 hours, I called a locksmith and it was $320. They didn't tell me about the door, and they don't want to reimburse me for the locksmith and think it's absurd that I asked. They said I was ""misconstruing their generosity""... because they let me say at their house...to take care of their cats. (I have a home that I'd much rather be at!

The car was totaled and she ended up off road and hit the back on a pole. I was very upset but luckily she was ok.

I vlogged about the incident and showed the damage to the car on my channel and mentioned that my daughter crashed it and in the video mentioned that she is not a very good driver. My intent was just content for my channel.

However she did not want me to do this and claimed it was humiliating. I never mentioned her by name and only people who know us and watch the channel could figure it out.

Me and my friend booked a room in a hostel to ourselves. We walked in and he 'taxed' (claimed) the nicer looking bed in the room. It was a bottom bunk, next to the fan. Fair enough.

My bed was on the floor next to it, which also had another empty bed about a metre away.

We went our for dinner and then came back. He put his empty McDonald's bag on his bed, and put his shirt on the edge of the bed. I looked at what I thought was my bed and realised I could put the two beds together to make a double bed.

He also realised that and suddenly said 'I untax this bed and tax that bed instead' and began to get on to my bed. 

We're the only two in the room. So I would assume that if he claims one bed, the other is mine? Surely he can't claim every bed. He says that because I didn't verbally claim the bed and get on it yet, it could be his to claim.

Well I'm on the bed(s) now and he disagrees. He insisting he gets first choice of the beds at the next hostel. I say he's had his choice of this hostel and at most he gets to try and claim one first.

45,1dykhh5,AITA for refusing to participate in a friend's fetish?,"I've (41M) been dating my current girlfriend (28F) for about eight months. Early in the relationship, she introduced me to some friends of hers, a couple I'll call Fred and Ginger. 

Over time, as I got to know them, I learned that Fred & Ginger are into some pretty extreme BDSM. While I'm really uncomfortable with that whole scene, I don't want to judge or intrude on what consenting adults do amongst themselves. Also, Fred and Ginger never pushed anything on me, or overshared. Occasionally, something about their lifestyle would come up in conversation, and I would simply politely listen, the same way I would treat any topic about which I had no knowledge or interest in.

However, a little while ago, Fred and Ginger showed up to a hang out with a young (college-aged) woman. She was very quiet but seemed nice when I engaged her in conversation. She usually wouldn't speak until spoken to, and gave short, vague answers to questions. When I finally asked F&G who she was, they explained that she was their ""pet girl"". When I expressed confusion, they explained (probably in too much detail) what that meant, that she was effectively a full-time sex slave.

I was really creeped out but let it go. However, over the weekend, we saw the three of them at a house party and I was shocked. The girl was wearing an incredibly revealing outfit comprised of leather straps, and they were leading her around on a leash. This was at a house party where's everyone else was in normal street clothes, and acting as if this was perfectly normal. It was surreal.

For the first time, I mentioned to my girlfriend that this made me really uncomfortable. (In truth, I think I said, ""What the fuck is wrong with them?"") When I explained, she agreed that they probably went a little far, but that it was a private party and not in public. I still tried to be polite and, like everyone else, avoid acknowledging what was going on.

However, two things happened that caused an argument. The first thing was that I tried to address the ""pet girl"" and say hello, since we had met and spoken before (and I didn't want to be rude and ignore her.) Fred snapped, ""No, don't talk to her. She's not for talking;"" which seemed condescending and really irritated me. The second thing occurred when Fred and Ginger were separated. Fred said he had to go to the bathroom and asked me to hold the girl's leash while he did. I refused absolutely. He asked again and I responded, possibly a bit rudely, ""I want no part of this.""

This started an argument that spun out of control where Fred and Ginger accused me of being judgmental, a bigot, and ""puritanical"" (among other things) while I tried to defend myself. For my part, I definitely said some unkind and regrettable things as well. Unfortunately, my girlfriend found herself in the position of trying to referee the situation, which I do feel badly about. Ultimately, we left.

In talking on the way home, after I explained my position (that I felt that I had been pressured to participate in someone else's sex life and fetish without my consent) she said that she understood, but that I should have handled the situation better. However, ever since, Fred and Ginger have been blowing up her phone, saying some pretty ugly things about me. I don't want her to feel like she's caught in the middle of a stupid fight although, I acknowledge, that's exactly what has happened. She's asking me to apologize to them, but I feel like that would validate what they did and said and invalidate my position.

Early in the relationship, she introduced me to some friends of hers, a couple I'll call Fred and Ginger. 

Over time, as I got to know them, I learned that Fred & Ginger are into some pretty extreme BDSM. While I'm really uncomfortable with that whole scene, I don't want to judge or intrude on what consenting adults do amongst themselves. Also, Fred and Ginger never pushed anything on me, or overshared. Occasionally, something about their lifestyle would come up in conversation, and I would simply politely listen, the same way I would treat any topic about which I had no knowledge or interest in.

However, a little while ago, Fred and Ginger showed up to a hang out with a young (college-aged) woman. She was very quiet but seemed nice when I engaged her in conversation. She usually wouldn't speak until spoken to, and gave short, vague answers to questions. When I finally asked F&G who she was, they explained that she was their ""pet girl"". When I expressed confusion, they explained (probably in too much detail) what that meant, that she was effectively a full-time sex slave.

I was really creeped out but let it go. However, over the weekend, we saw the three of them at a house party and I was shocked. The girl was wearing an incredibly revealing outfit comprised of leather straps, and they were leading her around on a leash. This was at a house party where's everyone else was in normal street clothes, and acting as if this was perfectly normal. It was surreal.

For the first time, I mentioned to my girlfriend that this made me really uncomfortable. (In truth, I think I said, ""What the fuck is wrong with them?"") When I explained, she agreed that they probably went a little far, but that it was a private party and not in public. I still tried to be polite and, like everyone else, avoid acknowledging what was going on.

However, two things happened that caused an argument. The first thing was that I tried to address the ""pet girl"" and say hello, since we had met and spoken before (and I didn't want to be rude and ignore her.) Fred snapped, ""No, don't talk to her. She's not for talking;"" which seemed condescending and really irritated me. The second thing occurred when Fred and Ginger were separated. Fred said he had to go to the bathroom and asked me to hold the girl's leash while he did. I refused absolutely. He asked again and I responded, possibly a bit rudely, ""I want no part of this.""

This started an argument that spun out of control where Fred and Ginger accused me of being judgmental, a bigot, and ""puritanical"" (among other things) while I tried to defend myself. For my part, I definitely said some unkind and regrettable things as well. Unfortunately, my girlfriend found herself in the position of trying to referee the situation, which I do feel badly about. Ultimately, we left.

In talking on the way home, after I explained my position (that I felt that I had been pressured to participate in someone else's sex life and fetish without my consent) she said that she understood, but that I should have handled the situation better. However, ever since, Fred and Ginger have been blowing up her phone, saying some pretty ugly things about me. I don't want her to feel like she's caught in the middle of a stupid fight although, I acknowledge, that's exactly what has happened. She's asking me to apologize to them, but I feel like that would validate what they did and said and invalidate my position.

Context:

3 weeks ago, my (15F) parents (41F, 53M) welcomed into the world my twin baby brothers Jonah and Isaac. They are the sweetest bundles of joy, but were absolutely ""oops"" babies, on account of my parents' ages.

This is the situation:

Ever since the birth, my mom has been out of the house when the twins have needed something, in the bathroom, or too busy with whatever she's doing to come and tend to their needs. I know it's not work because she's a SAHM. My dad's never home, and my sister, Neveah, (17F) is too busy planning her wedding (in a state of mania and breaking down mentally because I don't think she even loves the guy she's engaged to) to help me with anything.

This leaves the babies to me. It was fine the first few days it happened, I get that healing from birth sucks and postpartum depression is a thing, but it doesn't feel fair that these responsibilities keep falling to me. This Sunday, at 6 in the morning while we were all getting ready for church, it fell to me to wake the twins, feed them, wash them, change them, and get them dressed. I also had to load them into the car. I hardly had time to get myself ready while my family was yelling for me to ""hurry up"" and ""get in the damn car, Libby,"" (thanks, Dad). I am fifteen. I also have marching band responsibilities. I do not have the mental bandwidth to deal with this.

This leads to today. My sister and I were having lunch while talking about wedding planning (she's getting married to our pastor's son (19M), so it's kinda a big deal). We were bantering and debating floral arrangements (she was having one of her better mental health days), when all of a sudden we heard the twins start crying. They screamed and cried, and I just sat flipping through magazines before I noticed my sister staring at me. The interaction went something like this:

Me: ""What, Neveah?""

Neveah, a bit annoyed: ""Aren't you gonna get that?""

Me: ""Get what?""

Neveah: ""The twins. Duh.""

I don't know what came over me, but I groaned and yelled that I hated being the boys' live-in nanny instead of their sister, and that I couldn't understand why Mom can't take care of them herself. I ranted for a while. I said I hated not being able to get sleep, or even take care of my own needs because I had to watch out for the boys first. Neveah got a nasty look on her face and told me I was an ass for trying to make Mom's life harder than it needs to be, and that I should be overjoyed that our parents have bestowed me the ""blessing"" of taking care of our brothers and being able to bond with them while they're still young. I asked her that if it was such a blessing, why couldn't she help out? This made her just get pissy with me and walk away.

It's been a few hours, and my sister still hasn't talked to me. It's very clear to me that she's been avoiding me, so am I really that much of an asshole for not wanting to take care of my brothers?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA For Telling My Sister I Hate Taking Care of My Baby Brothers?

At the moment we are not on the best of terms, he has trust issues when it comes to me because of stuff that happened in the past. But i’m saying this stuff happening almost a whole year ago. He has a “problem” where if he thinks or feels some type of way about me, he will confront me/discuss whenever HE wants to, not me. Usually these “discussions” lead to arguments. He does not take into consideration of what I do with my time and my life, because there is times that having a talk needs to wait! Let me clarify, I always let him know beforehand my plans. Whether is with myself, family, or friends. This one incident I was at the mall with 2 friends and with one of their moms. He started texting me how he feels about us and me and stating maybe we should break up. I was in the bathroom at the time and I told him we need to talk about this later, especially not over text. But he just kept texting me, and started to get disrespectful and started calling me a “B” if you know you know. So when I stepped out the bathroom, cause I believe I was in there for too long, I sat down with my friends and I just started crying because of how disrespectful he got towards me. My friends are supportive but it was still super embarrassing. He apologized later and went on with his day. Days later I was at a concert of my favorite artist I was seeing for the first time. And this was my first concert. He got mad at me for not telling him exactly when the concert ended because me and my friends were too busy getting food right after the concert ended, and so he thought I was talking to another man.. and mind you this is a Melanie Martinez Concert… yeah if you know.. Completely ruined the day for me. Didn’t even say sorry cause I “reacted” inappropriately, I was silent the whole car ride back with my friends. 

So I started going to the gym recently, and over here in California it’s HOT AF. So I like going to the gym very early in the morning, basically before sunrise. I told him i’m going at 5am one day and I was going to sleep after I told him. And let me tell you guys, I was very exhausted and lacked sleep and he knew that. When I was sleeping he texted me then purposely called me so I can look at his message asking why I am going so early and thought it was suspicious.. This made me so mad and called him ridiculous, I’ve expressed to him in the past when we used to go to the gym together that I have bad social anxiety and preferred to workout with him.. Eventually we stopped working out for months because of the terms we’re on, I started to get courage to go by myself early in the morning where there is less people, and i’ve communicated that. So when he woke me up I was mad and he said i’m overreacting. And then before this he called me during mid sleep at 3am because he thought “i wasn’t sleeping” and I cheated on him… I tell him goodnight every night and I have screentime.

Edit: Let me clarify.. I’m not sure if this is considered cheating but what happened was that I slept with someone while we were 3 weeks into talking… But not dating.. After that, I didn’t do anything to be disloyal.

52,1dyjppg,AITA for yelling at an 8 year old who touched my butt?,"Am I the asshole here?! During an Independence Day party in which most of the attendees were related to each other in some manner (siblings, cousins, parents, uncles…etc) I (38f) was touched on the butt by my cousin’s child (8f). I am pissed, yet everyone is downplaying the situation. 

Here’s what happened- 

The 8f child (out of the blue) touched her grandmother (69f) on the butt. The child apparently thinks it’s funny. I witnessed the action as I was standing right next to her. I also witnessed the grandmother say “don’t do that”. The 8f did the exact same thing to her grandmother again after she was told immediately not to. The grandmother, again, told her do not do that. At that time, the 8f child set her sights on me. I saw her coming and tried to turn and avoid the contact, but she made connection on my butt. I immediately said (very sternly) “absolutely not, do not touch me”. She ignored that command and touched my butt again. At that point, I yelled loudly “don’t touch me!” 

When I yelled don’t touch me, the 8f child postured in a manner that indicated that she wanted to challenge me. She puffed her chest and got as close to my body/face as she could (our bodies were touching). I put my hand on her shoulder and slowly extended my arm to remove her from my personal space. I said one more time that she should not touch me (I used the F word that time). (“Don’t f*cking touch me”)

I am very angry because no one addressed this disgusting behavior afterwards. The child was never instructed to apologize, the parents (my cousin, no less) have not apologized. 

I am even more angry that I truly believe that if this situation happened to a stranger, or some unrelated individual, that the parents would have been falling all over themselves with apologies. 

No one in my family seems to think this is a big deal.

At that time, the 8f child set her sights on me. I saw her coming and tried to turn and avoid the contact, but she made connection on my butt. I immediately said (very sternly) “absolutely not, do not touch me”. She ignored that command and touched my butt again. At that point, I yelled loudly “don’t touch me!” 

When I yelled don’t touch me, the 8f child postured in a manner that indicated that she wanted to challenge me. She puffed her chest and got as close to my body/face as she could (our bodies were touching). I put my hand on her shoulder and slowly extended my arm to remove her from my personal space. I said one more time that she should not touch me (I used the F word that time). (“Don’t f*cking touch me”)

I am very angry because no one addressed this disgusting behavior afterwards. The child was never instructed to apologize, the parents (my cousin, no less) have not apologized. 

I am even more angry that I truly believe that if this situation happened to a stranger, or some unrelated individual, that the parents would have been falling all over themselves with apologies. 

No one in my family seems to think this is a big deal.

We spontaneously moved in with each other after she broke up with her ex boyfriend, because she had a spare room in her apartment and couldn’t afford the rent alone. 
The same month we decided to move in with each other, I got into a relationship and she started her ""hoe phase"". I don’t have a problem with that. We both have our own rooms and she had a decent taste in guys (personality wise). It all went pretty good, until two weeks ago. She started something casual with a guy that she described to be a sociopath and a narcissist. When I voiced my concerns, she shut me down, saying she hasn’t really formed herself an opinion on him yet. So I let her be. A day later she found out that he had cheated on his girlfriend with her and broken up with that girl, the same day he had slept with my roommate. When I asked her what she was gonna do now, (expecting her to drop that rat like a hot potato) she told me that she - again, didn’t form an opinion on that yet, and that she thought about continuing to see him again.

To keep it short, it was an old argument about how she had told one of my friend's abusive mothers that she had visited us for the holidays after I asked her if she could keep it a secret, and she agreed. There were other things going on with the visit that were my fault, but I feel like nothing warrants putting someone in danger like that. I have never gotten that mad at her before, because she refused to acknowledge her actions put my friend in danger. We both yelled, I used some language (which she hates) in frustration and called her a liar, and she threw me out in the middle of the argument with only my purse and keys.

She refunded my rent for this month and apologized today for telling my friend's mom. Before today, she told me over text she didn't want to hear from me until she reached out unless it was an apology, upon which I apologized for my behavior and left her alone. I am currently rotating between living with my fiancé's family and my dad; me and my fiancé will be moving together on the 19th, so I only have to figure things out until then. She has been packing my stuff, and my brother has dropped off enough stuff so I can get by. She is planning on leaving the boxes in the garage, and not letting me back in the house at all again to collect sensitive items, say goodbye to our cats, or anything else. 

I thought this argument was the only thing that she threw me out over, but afterwards, she sent me a text saying she's tired of me keeping my room the way it is (messy, but not grossly so), she's tired of not getting extra invites to my wedding because she has helped me in the past, and she's tired of me not being more grateful for a loan she gave me (which I have paid back consistently with the terms we agreed to and have thanked her numerous times before). The latter two I was not aware she felt that way, since she hadn't brought it up. This is the only big argument we have had in months.

I know I was the asshole in the argument. My behavior was out of line despite the topic of argument.

All the houses on my street share walls, forming a row of connected homes. My next-door neighbor (60f) recently got a groodle dog, and it's clear she has no interest in training or disciplining it properly.

About two months ago, my roommate found dog poop and a chewed-up toy in our backyard. I was baffled as to how the dog got in but informed my neighbor. She apologized half-heartedly, and I thought that would be the end of it. The very next day, more dog poop appeared.

For a month, I consistently told my neighbor she needed to keep her dog on her side of the fence because it was almost daily I found dog poop, or some kind of torn up paper, toy, etcetera. I spent hours trying to find where the dog was getting in, to no success. Finally, I sent one last warning to my neighbor, stating that if I saw her dog in my backyard again, I would spray paint it.

It's now obvious this isn't an accident. Every time I've brought it up, my neighbor dismissively claims she's ""working on it,"" but I've never once seen her walk the dog or even leave her house. While I understand she's elderly, adopting a dog you can't properly care for is simply irresponsible and cruel, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.

The other day, I found poop in my yard for the third time that week. My roommates and I decided to follow through on our warning. We bought some pink ***pet-safe!!*** spray dye. Yesterday, I finally caught the dog in my lawn. As I distracted it with treats, my roommate sprayed a pink line down its back.

This morning, my doorbell rang incessantly. I answered to find my neighbor, red-faced and irate, with her now pink-streaked dog. She accused me of being cruel and claimed this was animal cruelty. She then had the audacity to say it was unfair because she's old and ""can't stop"" the dog from running into my yard.

Now I'm torn. Am I the asshole for following through on my warning after months of this neighbor's neglect and disregard for my property?

That is the spray that we used, completely safe for animals. I can also assure you when the dog was getting ""spray-painted"" which was probably the wrong word to use in the beginning, he was completely fine, and it took maybe one second to do a small stripe down his back and then he got treats and also some belly rubs. 

People asking how we knew the dog was the one popping in the yard - my other neighbour does not have a dog, nor does their neighbour. 

Also I am not calling her old, she used her age as an excuse for why she can't properly care for the dog, which she is not doing. Me and my other roommate work from home and have only ever seen her take that dog out on a walk a handful of times in the months she's had it. Hence why, he is pooping in our lawn. Also my only other option was to call animal control which would not have ended up any better for that dog. 

I understand that I could have done something towards my neighbour and not the dog, but I warned her if she allowed him back on the property I would do it. Also, she was more then angry so mission accomplised i guess?

60,1dyieec,AITA for wanting my in laws to respect my child’s privacy?,"
This is a long shot but I didn’t know where else to go for advice. I (21 F) and my (25 m) boyfriend had a baby earlier this year. Exciting right? Unfortunately, we hadn’t gotten along to well during the pregnancy, to save time, I’ll just say he said and did a lot of things he shouldn’t have but I didnt want to raise our son without his father in his life so we started working on the relationship. Now to start this off, his parents have been nothing but horrible to me behind my back, calling lawyers to try and take custody from me, attacking us for giving our son my last name and not theirs, guilt tripping us into seeing him when their in town even when we have a busy schedule, just overall toxic behavior. Now as a young mom who has seen millions of horror stories, even I do not have my son as my profile picture on any platform, nor do i post him hardly ever, it’s unsettling. However, everytime i mention to my boyfriend how his family has our child as theirs makes me uncomfortable he always tells me “yeah i’ll talk to them”.

This is a long shot but I didn’t know where else to go for advice. I (21 F) and my (25 m) boyfriend had a baby earlier this year. Exciting right? Unfortunately, we hadn’t gotten along to well during the pregnancy, to save time, I’ll just say he said and did a lot of things he shouldn’t have but I didnt want to raise our son without his father in his life so we started working on the relationship. Now to start this off, his parents have been nothing but horrible to me behind my back, calling lawyers to try and take custody from me, attacking us for giving our son my last name and not theirs, guilt tripping us into seeing him when their in town even when we have a busy schedule, just overall toxic behavior. Now as a young mom who has seen millions of horror stories, even I do not have my son as my profile picture on any platform, nor do i post him hardly ever, it’s unsettling. However, everytime i mention to my boyfriend how his family has our child as theirs makes me uncomfortable he always tells me “yeah i’ll talk to them”.

61,1dyie4c,AITA for not asking my gf to meet? ,"I (22M) made plans with my gf (22F) this coming saturday, about a month ago. Today, she cancelled on me saying that some random girl in her office invited her to her bday party, on the same Saturday. She couldn't say no to her. She was out visiting the manufacturing plants of her company when she got invited. I was sad but agreed to her going to the party. She asked all this while I was in my office. 

When I was about to leave the office, it started raining heavily. I'm currently living in a hotel provided by my company, 30 minutes away. As she was about to reach her office, she said that I'll come near your hotel to meet today, I was like yeah sure. But since it was raining heavily, I waited for some time for the rain to calm down (I was supposed to commute in a motorcycle).  

The rain calmed down a bit and I messaged her that I'm leaving the office in 5 minutes but I'll probably go to my hotel directly and I left. It was pouring down heavily the whole way. The only reason I said that I'll go to my hotel first cause I had an office laptop in my bag and it would be a lot better and safer if I kept it in my place and then went to meet her. 

Upon reaching my hotel, I saw her message that ""it's alright, I'll book cab to my place"". I got scared, called her,  she didn't pick, called her again, she answered. I asked her if she reached safely or not to which she rudely replied that I'm still here and cut the call. Now, I was already upset on her cancelling the plans yet I asked if she reached safely. I expected her to atleast say that ride safe, or text me when you reach home, or don't travel in rain as it's not safe but there was nothing, which left me even more furious. 

Now, she ignored me for quite a while, I calmed myself down. When she finally replied, she said that I didn't want to meet, I just said that I'll directly go to hotel. Now, I accept that I wasn't clear with my communication as I was in a hurry. I should've said that I'll meet afterwards but she just assumed that I don't want to meet. 

All the blame was put on me that I don't want to meet, I said I'll directly go to hotel,  she came all the way to meet me and I didn't want to meet. I said you could've cleared the confusion by asking if I wanna meet to which she said ""Why would I ask when I've already told you that I'm coming to meet you"". Then saying that when you called you should've asked to meet. Ending the conversation by saying that ""I dont feel like meeting now. Feels like it will turn out the same as today""

62,1dyi8dw,WIBTA to ask for a refund of the servers automatic gratuity tip?,"It was my husband’s bday yesterday and we celebrated at a restaurant with a total of 25 people(us included). There was only one server that served us and he was great for the most part. He snapped back at me twice but he was also in the middle of dispersing food. I didn’t like it, but I didn’t make a fuss. As much as I don’t think he should have done that, I understand stressful situations and sometimes, it comes out without even realising it.  Other than that the evening went great! When it was time for us to pay, he said a small speech about how grateful he is that we chose this restaurant to celebrate my husband and the whole table got quiet and heard it. When he finished his speech, he handed the mini card terminal to my husband. He didn’t show us a breakdown of the bill or anything, we kinda just tapped the card and he left. We did see how much it cost, and it was $750. It was definitely a lot more than we planned but we didn’t want to look shocked in front of everyone so we brushed it off for the time being. 

As we were driving home, I pulled out the reciept and saw that the total cost for food drinks tax was $573. And the rest was his additional gravity tip of $177. He did warn us that there will be an automatic gratuity charge added but I always that it would be 18%, max 20%! $114.6, I don’t care round to 115. But $177 for tip?!?!? 
I feel a little robbed… and I want to call the restaurant and complain till I get at least my extra $62 back if not more, for overcharging. 
My husband said to leave it alone and not associate his birthday with a bad experience. And I get that. But at the same time I feel annoyed and used. I would’ve said something if I saw it at the restaurant but I only saw the breakdown of everything after we got in the car.

Recently, me and this guy (29) started talking, I made it very clear on my dating profile that my dog would come before and newcomers and that I was very short on time due to my dedication to this dog. I get chances for free time, as my dad often takes the dog to work with him as well (my dads got so much experience with these dogs lol, which is why I’ve got him).

I told him it wasn’t happening, he immediately snapped at me and told me I was prioritizing a dog over him and he was offended because we’ve been talking for two weeks without having met up. I apologized, but told him I wouldn’t be abandoning my dog today when we already had plans. He told me I was an asshole and shouldn’t even try dating, and then ghosted me.

A couple weeks ago I got a message from a 21m guy I used to see around high school all the time. I had a relatively big high school so it wasn’t uncommon for people to be in the same grade and never talked to each other before. We had a few classes together but never talked. He was the typical “popular” kid. Everyone loved him he was on like all of the sports teams. He was voted prom king. Plus he was smoking hot lol. Blah blah blah you get it.  Me being me I was a plus size, loner, nerd ,with big glasses, and a few friends so imagine my surprise when I got a message from him a couple weeks ago and he was flirting with me!!! My high school self would have been so jelly and would never have believed it!!! I admit I haven’t changed much since high school. I’m the same nerdy, loner, plus size, with glasses except I’ve learned to love that about my self.  Well we were talking for a couple days and everything was going really good. Like weirdly perfect. He was being super sweet. Sending me good morning texts. Calling me beautiful. Telling me all the right things. Well the other day I sent him a text about one of my friends from high school that I was gonna have lunch with over text and he immediately texted me back saying “hey you know not to tell anyone we are talking and flirting with each other right?”. I asked him why obviously he asked and I quote “well I can’t let anyone know I’m into you because ur a bigger girl.” In that moment I felt like my high school self again. Someone who’s only value is held with how much they weigh. I was hurt. So here’s where I may be the ahole. I might’ve maybe posted our whole conversation on tiktok, fb, insta, and snap. Then made sure he looked at my tiktok and then blocked him on everything and then just went to sleep. Thinking that a couple people from high school would see it and it would embarrass him. Well the one on TikTok got a couple hundred thousand views and now I feel a bit bad that so many people have seen it. I heard he deleted all of his social media. I didn’t want to force him off of social media I just wanted people to see he’s a jerk. AITA? 


Edit: I realized I didn’t mention three key details in my original post. One is I deleted the all my posts the TikTok first as soon as I woke up. Two I only posted a screen shot of the convo of him saying I’m a bigger girl blah blah blah. Not all of our conversations. Three I have like a mostly private TikTok with only 20 followers from like high school. Even then I blocked out his name and profile on the tik tok. I only posted on snap his name and profile. And I wasn’t friends with him on TikTok so I didn’t the he would see he exposed himself by commenting on the tiktok saying vulgar things to me.

I told my mom I don't like it and she said it would be rude to ask them to not speak a certain language, especially since that was my dads first language. She says it's respectful on my husbands end and it's good they they're getting along so well.

68,1dyhmwd,AITA for asking my step daughter to go through her mothers belongings,"So, my husband (54 Male) and I (41 Female) have been married for almost 3 years, we have been together for almost 10 years, we have a blended family of 6 kids. Both of us went through pretty nasty divorces.

In 2021 my husband’s ex-wife passed away unexpectedly. My stepdaughter (22) and her daughter were living with the ex-wife at the time. My husband and I lived in a smaller place as most of the kids had at the time moved out. We made space for her, her daughter and her boyfriend.

For a bit of back story, the ex and I never got along. This in turn to my stepdaughter and I never really getting along, to the point that when she had her child at the very young age of 16, she informed her dad (my husband) she did want me to be in the baby’s life. When I said OK and stepped back and steered clear when they came over, she would have a fit for not interacting with the baby. She has lied to her father about things that have never happened and caused explosive fights with myself and my husband.

So, when they all moved in with us they took over my garage with a lot of her mother’s belongings. There was also a c-can full of stuff. We decided we needed to move to accommodate everyone, since the rent prices went up some of the kids had to move home. We have a larger house, but her mother’s stuff is filling the garage and 2 storage areas in the house. There is no storage for anyone else. (I want to mention she has the full basement suite and our Media Room that's the size of a 2-car garage)

The other day I text the family group chat and said we need to go through some stuff. Start getting rid of some stuff. Old furniture, shoes, clothes toys etc. I talked to my step daughter and said maybe try to go through it and get rid of a few things (expired Mary Kay/Avon makeup and stuff) or at least open up the bins and see if we can compress some stuff to try and make space and know where stuff is. She went straight to her dad saying I was forcing her to throw her mother's stuff away. Which is not the case. But I guess I was causing a great deal of stress and anxiety.

Yesterday we were all in the pool having a couple drinks, sharing some laughs and just relaxing. A few the kids ended up going out for a bit and I got out of the pool, headed upstairs and changed. I went to the living room and was ripped a new one for asking her to look through stuff. I tried to explain what had actually happened, but he was not wanting to listen or hear me. This turned into another massive fight, and him calling me a bunch of awful names again (including the C word multiple times) in front of our 5 and half year-old granddaughter.

69,1dyhht5,AITA for not coming out ,"I (15F) and my girlfriend (15F) have been dating for two years since 7th grade. I fell head over heels in love with her on the first day of school. She is open about her sexuality and has very accepting parents, both with an alt aesthetic. I come from a traditional family in a Republican neighborhood, and I don’t care much for politics.

This past school year, we started high school. Many friends knew we were dating, but we didn’t publicize our relationship, especially because I have three older siblings at the same school. She was upset when I refused to go to homecoming with her because I didn’t want my siblings to know. She didn’t understand, being an only child with accepting parents. I still went to homecoming, just with friends, including my guy best friend Luke, who is also queer but closeted. He is more religious than I am, even though his family isn’t.

My oldest brother drove us to homecoming and joked to Luke not to fool around with me, making Luke and my girlfriend uncomfortable. I didn’t react, but my girlfriend was upset all night. I didn’t dance with her to any slow songs, not wanting to be judged. When we went to an ice cream shop afterward, she was mad about my brother’s comment. I reassured her I only liked her and that Luke was gay, but she was upset that I didn’t give her a homecoming poster and that we didn’t dance alone. We agreed to disagree, but her friends started being mean to me. We didn’t go to the winter dance and dated until April. I thought things were fine, except for a few arguments we worked out. I was in track season, and she was in the school musical.

Here's where ""Am I the Asshole?"" comes in. I made it to sectionals for varsity track, hosted at my school. My girlfriend wanted to come, but I was opposed because my parents would be there. I told her over FaceTime that if she did come, she wouldn’t be my girlfriend. I meant that my parents should only think of her as my friend, but she took it as a threat to break up and blocked me on everything. It’s been three months, and I haven’t been able to explain. She is my soulmate, and I can’t live without her.

70,1dyh5o7,AITA for swearing at the doctor? ,"My mum suffers with severe pain in her back as she was recently diagnosed with spondylosis, she also gets upset very easily and suffers from mental health. She is visiting me from Ireland (I'm based in the UK) and she realised when she arrived late on Friday that her pharmacist forgot to put in her strong painkillers. The doctors surgery was closed throughout the weekend so she has been suffering over the weekend with bad pain and what I suspect as withdrawals too. She has been in tears over the weekend and today (monday), I advised her to go ring an emergency doctor for herself over the weekend which she refused.

She went to the doctors in the morning to which they said she wasn't registered with them (they disputed), she went home and rang 111 who said she was registered. She goes back and they tell her that they will ring her later for an appointment. My mum at this point is irrational with pain and can't wait a few hours without calling back or driving down to ask for an appointment. They say each time they will ring her back before they close at 6.

My mum waits till 6 and then goes to a hotel to try get a sleep with the pain, I get a call from the doctor at 7:10 asking questions about my mum. I explain that shes not here currently and that shes suffering from spondylosis and has been crying all weekend and needs help getting painkillers. He said they were closed and started rambling, I confronted him and said quoute for quote 'It's abit of a piss take that my mum was told she would be rang back and wasn't when she is crying and in so much pain'. The doctor said something along the lines of 'What did you just say' in an angry voice. I repeated myself and he started extremely raising his voice at me explaining that my mum is wrong and noone ever said that and like seriously in an aggressive tone. I was so shocked that I was being shouted at by a doctor for saying that the way they treated my mum was a pisstake that I simply asked him to stop raising his voice at me, asked for his name (which he gave), and hung up.

My theory is that in my mums mental state she has got it wrong about them ringing back but I'm not entirely sure. Then again, the doctor should probably show a little more compassion/professionalism as I'm only 22 and don't want to see my mum in pain.

75,1dygnt0,AITA for blowing my neighbors firework debris into the street after the 4th of July?,"**Backstory:**


Three years ago our neighbor across the street knocked loudly on our door at 11 PM to drop off a misdelivered package. I couldn't see who it was and was extremely frightened as I wasn't expecting anyone. Seeing as they wouldn't go away after 10+ minutes, I called the police. When the police arrived it was determined to be my neighbor, and I apologized profusely for the misunderstanding. Since that time we've made up and we occasionally wave or have small talk in passing. I also avoid cutting my grass until they've moved their vehicles to avoid any debris hitting their cars at his request. Note: They are an african american family, while we are a white family. 


**Incident:**


On the 4th of July, my neighbors shot off fireworks for the first time since we moved in. They started on the curb touching my lawn where they park their cars, and burned a small spot on my grass. Realizing this, they watered the area and moved to the street. The next firework they shot off was bigger and they ran onto my lawn when it ignited, but later they stayed on their side. This continued for 2+ hours. I stayed inside the entire night. 

Fireworks in the street are illegal here. However, I didn't intervene since it was a holiday. After they finished, they sprayed down and cleaned most debris in the street. However, my yard had a large amount of firework debris and stains all over the place. 

The next day as I was preparing to mow the lawn, I used my leaf blower to clear the debris back into the street as I didn't want to run over any of it with the mower. It then started raining and I left to run errands. When I returned, my neighbors wife confronted me in my driveway, calling me petty for blowing debris ""towards them."" I explained my frustration at cleaning up a mess I didn't create, and that my other neighbors lawns didn't have any debris at all on them. She suggested sweeping & bagging it, and I asked her why do I have to clean it. I repeatedly said I didn't create the mess so why do I have to clean it up, and I brought up how my lawn had burn marks and how my new concrete was stained. Since it was clear ""I wouldn't understand"" She then accused me of being racist, referencing the police call. Upset, I argued back, emphasizing this was about firework debris, not race. She walked away, calling me names. I told her not to trip over the mess they created in the street. 


**Aftermath:**


An hour later, a cop arrived, responding to a complaint that we were shooting fireworks (We didn't) and blowing debris into their yard. I showed him video from my camera proving they launched the fireworks, damaged my lawn, and how I cleaned the debris. The cop confirmed we did nothing wrong and advised us not to speak with them again. He talked to them briefly before leaving.

76,1dygmbm,AITA for calling out my parents on their irresponsible financial decisions?,"So, I (18M) live with my parents (51M and 42F), who are first-generation immigrants that moved here about 17 years ago. Ever since they arrived, they’ve been struggling to make ends meet and basically living paycheck to paycheck. Recently, they’ve been struggling even more, and I wondered why. They’re very closed off about their financial state with us kids, but I knew they had invited some relatives from our home country to spend a month with us. I just assumed our relatives were going to pay for everything themselves.

That’s where the issue comes in. My parents told me they didn’t even have enough money to buy groceries this week, and I started to suspect something. So, I asked if they had indeed paid for our relatives’ plane tickets and personal costs, which they confirmed.

The problem isn’t that they paid, but that they don’t even have enough to pay for groceries and cover half of their bills, yet they still consciously and willingly paid for our relatives. That’s when I got a little mad. I scolded them about making better financial decisions, which they didn’t want to hear. They said, “Why would I listen to my 18-year-old son about financial decisions?” I responded that they shouldn’t wonder why they’re living in the streets in a couple of years if they keep it up.

77,1dygiy5,AITA for not inviting my brother to parties? ,"So my (31M) brother (37M) is on the autistic spectrum. He is not non-verbal and is able to live independently and work, but does exhibit the mild traits such as fixation on topics he likes, not picking up on some social cues and such. He is a bit of a homebody too, very infrequent drinker (which is of course absolutely fine).

A family friend is visiting and I floated the idea of going to dinner some time during his stay. I did not formally extend the invite to my brother, but was planning to mention it to him and would have no issue in him joining. 

Anyways I received a call from my father recently saying he was disappointed in me for not extending the invite for to my brother, which I kind of understand. However, he went on to say that he also didn't like that I don't invite my brother to parties. I have not thrown many parties in my time and the last was probably over 2 years ago. My rationale for not inviting him is that firstly, while I love my brother we are very different people with not many of the same interests. Secondly, and meaning no disrespect to the neurodivergent, it can be quite difficult to have a conversation with him that doesn't centre on the topics he is interested in discussing. Thirdly, any party I'd attend or throw would most likely not be his scene and I'd worry about him mentioning what occurred to our parents. I tend to filter my behaviour around our parents and am unsure as to whether he would share what I got up to with them, even if I were to ask him not to. 

I should add that my brother doesn't extend invites to me regarding events he is attending, which I am completely fine with.

Our kids are also friends and Liz and I even lead a homeschool nature group together. Mike will often bring his kids to fish in my private lake. We all get along well and have grown close.

I went through a divorce last year that ended my 21 year marriage. My ex had never spent time with Mike and Liz, as he tended to have friends of his own and chose to socialize separately from me. (That's another story entirely) After the divorce, Mike and Liz were there for me. Mike offered to help me with some of the chores around the house that my ex used to do. But in general, I'm a pretty independent person and decided I should learn to do these things on my own. I also am very careful about not overstepping boundaries, especially with married folks.

Recently, Mike's comments in social media private messages have begun to take on a flirty tone. Since my divorce, I have loved being in full control of my own body again, as my ex used to require that I always dress very modestly and not draw attention to myself. I work hard to keep myself in shape and am experiencing a kind of personal renaissance of self love and adventure.

Mike's dms started out somewhat innocent ""you look great!"" ""How are you aging in reverse?"", etc. But recently, they've taken on a different tone that has led me to feel almost ashamed of posting pics of my kids and I at the beach, me in a bikini, or a photo of me out with friends in a flirty dress.

Comments have suddenly shifted to ""this may be inappropriate, but you could definitely make some extra money on 'own lee fans'"" and ""wow, just wow"" to a pic of me and my son on the beach. He DM'd me a video from 5 years ago when he and I threw his wife a surprise bday party and I carried in the cake while we sang. I was dressed modestly, with a tshirt underneath a long sundress, as I always did back then. He commented ""Bet you'd never wear a shirt under a sundress, or one that long now!""

I've blocked him from seeing my stories and no longer post photos of myself dressing in my new found freedom on my grid. I am hurt by his lack of respect for me and for our friendship. It's given me the ick big time.

But my question is, should I continue to keep this to myself and not show Liz his DM's?

I worry she will think it's something personal between us.

82,1dyftwp,AITA for telling my friend to break up with his girlfriend?,"Throwaway.

I’ve been friends with “Adam,” for about 7 years. He’s been a great friend, and he’s usually the first person I can call for casual drinks. He’s fun and is quite honestly the life-of-the-party. 

Adam and “Eve,” have been together for 3 years. Eve is a great girl. She’s fun, friendly and has a very genuine soul. 

I would take a bullet for Adam, but one of my least favourite things about him is the way he speaks about his girlfriends. 

Everytime we go out together, he will go on a long winded rant about how much Eve annoys him. He’s dissected and disparaged every part of her personality. Honestly, it’s exhausting. I understand occasionally venting about your partner - but it’s all the time we are together. To make it worse, he will always end his rant with something along the lines of “at least she’s hot.” 

It’s insufferable.

I’m not the only one feeling like this either. All the guys are annoyed with Adam’s behaviour. No onef wants to listen to someone nitpick their girlfriend and then immediately turn around and  talk about how the sex is great and/or how hot they are. 

We’ve tried to gently ask Adam to stop, but he always pushes back with, “You guys wouldn’t understand it (cause many of us are single),” or “I’m just letting off my frustrations.” 

Most of us just let him drone on, waiting awkwardly. 

This past weekend, Adam invited us to watch the Euros. Eve grilled all the meats, made all the sides, and poured us shots. Also, Eve watched most of the match with us.

The moment Eve left, Adam started his regularly scheduled rant. He said that she was “trying too hard,” (She always prepares something for us when he hosts) and made it awkward by sitting with us. 

A few guys were rolling their eyes and shaking their heads in disagreement, but no one said anything directly.

I, for starters, was fed up. I came to watch some football, eat some good food, and drink some alcohol. I didn’t want to hear Adam talking about Eve for the hundredth time. 

I interrupt him and I ask, “If you don’t like her that much, why don’t you just break up with her?” Adam laughed and said, “Because of the sex obviously.” 

I immediately respond with, “Either break up with her or shut the fuck up about her.” 

After I said that, Adam was clearly annoyed and a few minutes after that, told everyone to leave. 

Later that evening, he told me that my comment was out-of-line and that I should not meddle in other people's relationships. 

The other guys said that I kind of disrespected their relationship in his house. 

I haven’t spoken to Adam since, but I’m wondering if I did something wrong. Maybe it’s not my business and I shouldn’t have commented. I don’t know how Adam is behind closed doors and I don’t want to stick my nose in his business.

I live alone and throughout the summer vacation I wanted to spend some time with my family. My overall personality is based on humour and always having a laugh over whatever the theme of the conversation is.

84,1dyfeod,AITA not letting my ex-husband tell our kid that he is dying?,"Throwaway for privacy. 

My (35f) ex-husband (34m) had 1 child (14). Kid has been in my sole custody since our divorce in 2013. He has never had a job or a stable home since I left. I did not push for child support because I did not want to make it harder for him to get on his feet. I was always open for visitations. Kid use to even stay with him on weekends until about 7 or 8 years ago when I discovered Ex was living with a registered criminal. He didn't realize either though and agreed with the decision. Even after he moved several times he stopped taking Kid, it was never brought up by either of us. 

I have always tried to leave Ex's relationship with Kid in his hands; he is an adult. I have never created any barriers (unless I legally had to). When he randomly showed up on my doorstep asking for cigarettes or money, and fleetingly saying hello to Kid, I never nagged, I never painted it as bad. Because I didnt want it to weigh on Kid as a negative thing. I never spoke ill of Ex to Kid, the best I could, but I cannot control that Ex would only show up randomly 4 to 5 times a year. 

Kid is 14 now, and they don't know their dad on any real level. Their relationship is basically non-existant. It goes on like this until about 6 months ago when I moved across the country. I told Ex, even though there wasn't much he could do about it, and he accepted it, making promises to visit Kid this summer. I was lucky enough to be able to fly Kid back home to stay 2 weeks with my sister who lives in the same area as Ex. I told Ex that Kid would be in town if he would like to see them. 

Instead of coordination, he showed up at my mother's (who did not have Kid) and starts going on and on about how he has a terminal brain injury and is dying, and that he needs to see Kid to tell them that he is dying. When Ex left my mom's she contacted me obviously concerned. 

I was enraged. I was so disgusted that he wanted to have this (potentially fabricated) tragic moment with his estranged Kid about his impending ""death"" as like what? To make himself feel important to someone?

So.. I sent a long text to his girlfriends fb messenger (because his phone is broken of course so we talk through her. Not like i haven't dealt with that before.) I won't quote it but basically I accused him for lying about his death for attention and wanting to hurt Kid for his own sick fulfillment of feeling loved, and said if he said one word to Kid that he would be cut off and blocked from all contact with my family, and once Kid was home he'd be blocked from their phone as well. 

AITA? 

*Edit: Thanks for all the feedback, it's been a big help.

Update 1: Kid decided they didn't want to see dad because it makes them sad every time they see him, and that it's awkward. Now, with a week left before traveling back home, I'm trying to facilitate this quickly, calmly, and from 3k miles away. I've texted Ex's girlfriend, and she said she is gathering his medical paperwork to text me by this evening. If I decide it's legitimate, I will unfortunately have to deliver this information to Kid over FaceTime because I do not trust the delivery method of Ex. This information will hurt Kid, and they will feel guilted into seeing their dad when they didn't want to, but I think it's better than feeling guilty for not seeing him before he passes.

*final update*

The condition he has is from a brain injury he got 21 years ago. So he's been essentially ""dying"" from this for 21 years. I don't want to get too into it for his privacy, but that's the jist. The ""time he has left"" numbers he has been throwing around is what comes up when you google the medical term for the condition. Not his personal prognosis.

Kid use to even stay with him on weekends until about 7 or 8 years ago when I discovered Ex was living with a registered criminal. He didn't realize either though and agreed with the decision. Even after he moved several times he stopped taking Kid, it was never brought up by either of us. 

I have always tried to leave Ex's relationship with Kid in his hands; he is an adult. I have never created any barriers (unless I legally had to). When he randomly showed up on my doorstep asking for cigarettes or money, and fleetingly saying hello to Kid, I never nagged, I never painted it as bad. Because I didnt want it to weigh on Kid as a negative thing. I never spoke ill of Ex to Kid, the best I could, but I cannot control that Ex would only show up randomly 4 to 5 times a year. 

Kid is 14 now, and they don't know their dad on any real level. Their relationship is basically non-existant. It goes on like this until about 6 months ago when I moved across the country. I told Ex, even though there wasn't much he could do about it, and he accepted it, making promises to visit Kid this summer. I was lucky enough to be able to fly Kid back home to stay 2 weeks with my sister who lives in the same area as Ex. I told Ex that Kid would be in town if he would like to see them. 

Instead of coordination, he showed up at my mother's (who did not have Kid) and starts going on and on about how he has a terminal brain injury and is dying, and that he needs to see Kid to tell them that he is dying. When Ex left my mom's she contacted me obviously concerned. 

I was enraged. I was so disgusted that he wanted to have this (potentially fabricated) tragic moment with his estranged Kid about his impending ""death"" as like what? To make himself feel important to someone?

So.. I sent a long text to his girlfriends fb messenger (because his phone is broken of course so we talk through her. Not like i haven't dealt with that before.) I won't quote it but basically I accused him for lying about his death for attention and wanting to hurt Kid for his own sick fulfillment of feeling loved, and said if he said one word to Kid that he would be cut off and blocked from all contact with my family, and once Kid was home he'd be blocked from their phone as well. 

AITA? 

*Edit: Thanks for all the feedback, it's been a big help.

Update 1: Kid decided they didn't want to see dad because it makes them sad every time they see him, and that it's awkward. Now, with a week left before traveling back home, I'm trying to facilitate this quickly, calmly, and from 3k miles away. I've texted Ex's girlfriend, and she said she is gathering his medical paperwork to text me by this evening. If I decide it's legitimate, I will unfortunately have to deliver this information to Kid over FaceTime because I do not trust the delivery method of Ex. This information will hurt Kid, and they will feel guilted into seeing their dad when they didn't want to, but I think it's better than feeling guilty for not seeing him before he passes.

*final update*

The condition he has is from a brain injury he got 21 years ago. So he's been essentially ""dying"" from this for 21 years. I don't want to get too into it for his privacy, but that's the jist. The ""time he has left"" numbers he has been throwing around is what comes up when you google the medical term for the condition. Not his personal prognosis. 

Final verdict: I was the asshole, but I was also right. ",3.0,1.0629856586456299,1,0
85,1dyf75m,AITA for kicking someone’s bag,"I (M 28) had gotten off a flight that landed late evening after a long trip and was headed home. To make things worse I had developed a terrible toothache and was in a great amount of pain.

So I boarded the bus which takes us from the plane to the airport terminal and sat down on a seat next to the door.

Somebody got on in a hurry and stepped on my foot. I was really annoyed but all I did was shoot them an angry glare. They didn’t even apologise.

Then a few seconds later somebody threw their bag while boarding the bus and it landed on my foot. Granted it wasn’t heavy or anything but I was getting really annoyed and impatient and out of reflex / irritation I kicked the bag.

Then a few seconds later the owner of the bag (lady in mid fifties) starts yelling saying how dare I kick her bag etc. and starts making snarky remarks in a language I do not speak. I understood a bit where she said she is old and lamented about bad manners of the youth.

I stood my ground and asked her why she had to throw the bag but she didn’t answer me. Eventually I gave up and ignored her for the rest of the ride.

Background: 36M here
Have a female best friend(32) going on 14 years now. Have been in each other’s life for lots of crap and even stuff post won’t let me put on here and have helped each other through a lot. We had a small fling back 12 years ago when I was 24 and she was 20 just sex not dating or anything and was only for a few months. But after that both agreed just didn’t feel right so just been friends since. She was roommate for about 2 years and moved out 3 years ago.

Conflict: Started talking to GF(36) on and off about 9 months ago and we started dating 3 months ago. Told her all about best friend and history…she was def jealous and stuff about it. But I told here since she has moved out we don’t talk/hang out much just cause both our lives pretty busy and part of growing up, and she has a BF so putting time towards him. But do check up on each other. 

Told her since she isn’t comfortable with it that we wouldn’t hang out alone at each others house or anything but just go to a movie or grab something to eat if we wanted to catch up, which happens like once every few months or when a movie we both would want to see comes out. 

So gf just gave me ultimatum that I can’t go to movies or dinner or anything with her because she doesn’t believe that a guy and girl can be plutonic and says if we want to hang out she has to be around as well but that if I do want to hang out with my friend then I might as well end our relationship…I said that’s a little crazy, and understand the whole like just hanging out at house or something but said I’m not putting her feelings forward and I feel like she isn’t putting my history with friend in perspective either and is just super jealous. And mind you I see my gf like 3 times a week and talk to her everyday, so AITA or is she being to jealous?

I’ve witnessed multiple situations in which she has cussed out my girlfriend and threatens to kick her out the house to the streets for simple mistakes (ex: forgetting to put clean dishes in the cabinet or taking out the trash), has full-blown temper tantrums when my girlfriend wants to do anything with her social life and basically forces my girlfriend to cancel any plans she’s made, and a lot of other (and more severe) problems that I’m not going to get into. Plus, she has created several fights in our relationship by implanting lies about how I feel about my girlfriend inside my girlfriends head to the point where she nearly believes it, most of which dealing with infidelity (which I never have or ever will do!). Despite all this, my girlfriend still loves her mom and has taken the initiative of being her caretaker and sole financial provider (she technically has been doing this since high school as her mom has chosen not to work in almost two decades). She has been doing this up until a few months ago because my girlfriend and I recently got our first apartment together post college graduation.

Y found it while going through J's phone, J saw and told Y to not involve themselves in it, and Y went against their own partner to confront mine...Livid, I texted Y ""Do not ever involve yourself in my marriage again."" without a response. A few days later, the other friend went to my partner claiming that I had THREATENED Y with that message, and that I am the only one completely in the wrong here and that they're outraged with me.

They feel that they were being good friends to my partner and helping them. So, Who is the A Hole?",0.0,0.033525895327329636,0,1

Yes, we did go to the same highschool but they only became friends after I cut off Jade, and of course I wasn't gonna stop them because I didn't want to seem like a mad control freak, yet I find it odd how Bree would still be friends with Jade after everything I told her and all the things she ruined for me. To make things weirder, Bree told me that jade shittalked me with her for 2 hours straight and bree added ""You're such a fun gossip topic ngl"" which I had to laugh off but internally I was not cool with that and bree is nothing but a hypocrite in my eyes now because how does she shittalk me with Jade act all lovey posting themselves together and then come tell me about it and listen to me rant about how Jade literally traumatized me from all relationships???

93,1dyei8z,AITA for how I handled this situation w/ my ex roommate? ,"I had this situation a while ago, but I still wonder if I could've handled it differently. I asked her if she could at least tell me abt her overnight guests due to reasons related to anxiety/past trauma. I know I should've invested in a camera but I was broke af and I guess I just wanted to be upfront abt it, because I normally would've kept these things to myself. She was put off by my request, but at the time she agreed to keep the peace.

One day, I woke up in the morning to hear her and her guest talking and thought that maybe she just arrived until my ex roommate texted me shortly after that she had brought her over at abt \~3 am and wanted to know if I was ""ok"" w/ it. I wasn't, and I emailed my RA and we agreed to have a meeting, but it was definitely not in my favor as the RA talked down to me in a condescending manner the entire time, and kept raising his voice at me, and thanks to having several anxiety disorders and a freeze response, I had a hard time speaking up for myself. The only things we agreed on was 1. I was to talk to student disability services so I could try to get a rm for myself b/c of my mental illness (mental illnesses count as psychological disabilities) 2. Find a new therapist and 3. That my ex roommate wasn't the necessarily the worst, and we just had this one hang up thanks to me.

I had another 1 on 1 meeting w/ my RA to update him on the situation, and during this time my roommate and I weren't really talking and I could hear her complain about how much she disliked me when she brought guests over. I told my RA abt it and the entire time was spent invalidating my experience with her and again talking to me as if i were a child, and yelling angrily that she'd never do that. He started treating me better after I told him a little more abt me, and even offered to see me (he was in an lcsw program), but I was already set on not talking to him or seeking his help ever again.

This is where I messed up. On a few nights where I noticed she brought a guest overnight, I'd play music at a medium lv until 2/3 am just to be petty. Mind you, this was an apartment style dorm and we both had our own rooms. I didn't do this all the time, probably 4 times max. This was passive aggressive of me. Other times I just left the apartment ASAP or waited for them to leave first in the morning. Despite this, sometimes we were even friendly to each other. Fast forward to finals week, and she brought over another overnight guest again and when I asked her abt it, she denied it even though I could very clearly hear them talking. This made me upset, and when the day came for me to move out, I took all the household necessities, including the microwave, I had bought with me. I bought 80% of it out of pocket anyway, and she was supposed to help me with paying for a portion of it.

I don't really want to bring up the topic of asking my mom if she could go back to work because we usually get into arguments, but I just recently found out that the reason why she doesn't want to go back to work is because of my dad's new wife—for context tho, they've been annulled for almost a decade now—. My mom thinks that his new wife isn't working(I don't know if this is even true) but runs a business, a salon shop. and because of that she doesn't want to go back to work...

for 3 years. 

 
I have a relative that passed away a couple of months ago in their mid thirties and left behind 4 small children, we were very sad and this was a hard time for my family.

My boyfriend lives in another country, the same as my dead relatives family so we flew abroad and continued the funeral there. He has been fighting and arguing with me for the past month that my family did not give him any attention? They called and invited him for dinner a few times after the funeral but he did not show up because he was angry that they did not give him attention when he attended the funeral. Now he blames me for not standing up for him and fighting with my family. 

Also in the same week his cousin got married, I refused to go with his family since I were heartbroken and we had guests coming over all the time, he did not go to the wedding himself since he was at work. Now he still argues with me for not attending the wedding with his family.


How can he blame me in such situation and did I do something wrong?

AITA for not focusing on him while on the trip instead of the ongoing funeral that was in our home?

UPDATE:


We had an argument yesterday where he talked about the wedding and me not showing up, and he said some bad things about me and my family, he called me a wh@re and said that my father who cut me off because of him is not a man and has no dignity. The reason for this is that I attended my cousins wedding in the same country 6 months ago, he does not like my cousin and stated that I only went for male attention and was looking for a husband. I told him to come with me, he and his family were also invited but they dont like this family. 

I called my father in law and told him to make this stop since this is not the first time he says bad things. He listened and told me he would handle it.

He has now called my relatives and told them that our engagement is broken since I want too much and requested a vacation to dubai and said ” if i married your cousin he would take me there” this is straight up bs. He also told my uncle that I threathened him, he is a 75 year old man and I am more than half his age. He also told people I destroyed his son and that he has been miserable since he met me and that I forced him to be with me.

He wanted me to come and just stay longer saying that it was a really good time and it would have been more fun if we had stayed longer. I suggested that then we should alternate and I would go to ever other one. The weekend was one of the ones that it was my turn to come along again.

He got angry before we had even left the house saying that he didn’t want to go to the party already planning when we would leave. I reminded him that I don’t like to be at these things and I just wanted to set expectations that we would not be staying for more than 6-8 hours. I didn’t want to arrive at noon and stay until after dark in the middle of the summer.

He kept trying to explain to me that I was wrong and these parties are fun and its great to hang out with family and visit.

My hubs and I had to fly out last minute to be with and support my family as it was very devastating. It was hard financially on all of us, as my family was stuck in our hometown for weeks longer than they planned.

Flash forward, my dad lost his job due to discrimination against him from his disability from his stroke. They get a settlement from the company after almost a year of fighting. During all of it we dreamed of going to Hawaii, where my parents honeymooned, and going as a family because of the nightmare we were living.

My mom booked everything very suddenly, booked the trip in late May and the trip was the first week of November. My hubs and I have a decent amount of credit debt, enough to set us back. When we discussed Hawaii, my hubs multiple times expressed concerns about money, and expressed he would opt out for financial issues. My mom called him ""an asshole"" for saying he didn't want to go, and I ended up convincing him that money comes & goes.

My parents are now wanting us to pay them back for the trip, which was about 1,300 per person. It's been 7 months since, and my husband and I are trying to get back on track for our own debt that we had prior. My older brother works less than 16 hours a week and pretty much lives in the basement. Has never worked full time. My mom is also unemployed and has been for a few months now.

I tried expressing to my parents that we need to take care of our bills first, because Hawaii was sprung onto us suddenly and we weren't involved in a lot of the planning/financial aspect of it. It blew up into a huge argument and my dad screamed that we can just ""take it as a freebie"", and ""I don't want your effing money"", etc. My mom talked down to my husband and said he was arrogant, talks down to people, etc. 

I feel like they are relying on us to help them financially when we have completely separate lives & expenses from them, instead of getting my 27 year old brother to work full time. They claim he ""helps them a lot"", but every time I'm over there he's locked away in his room and is always rude and speaking down to them, and does the bare minimum.

My husband is over it and doesn't want to associate with my family anymore, and it hurts. Every time I try to express how I'm hurt from their actions, they get in their feelings and it becomes an argument. Everytime. So I feel like I can't even express to them that the way they spoke down to my husband was hurtful, and I feel like I need space from them. 

When they ""apologize"", they never take accountability, it's always ""I don't remember that but I guess I'm sorry"", or ""I'm sorry I'm acting like this, it's because of \*external thing happening\*"".

98,1dydwiw,AITA for faking my religiousness to keep my family together?,"My wife and I have been together for 16 years. We both started out kind of religious.  I had a Baptist upbringing and she had a Catholic upbringing. She's from a prominently Catholic country.  I'm from the bible belt. We have 3 kids together aged 7, 9 and 10.
Throughout our relationship, we really haven't practiced religion. In the early days, we prayed together. Since then, I've mostly become agnostic. I just don't care for religion.

My wife always seemed a slight bit more religious than me. Over the years, her mom and sister became super Christian. They worked on her, until it just all clicked for her. Now, over the past year and a half, she has become super Christian. 

We began going to a pentecostal church that her sister goes to. The pastor is young and seems pretty influential. I keep to myself. She pushes hard. I go with her to Sunday service,  but I don't sing.
Our second time going to this church she told the whole congregation that she was off her depression meds. I was unaware of this and it really upset me that she said this to everyone before me. She told me she was too afraid to tell me. She felt more comfortable telling me in front of the whole congregation.

Im not fully against church. I like the sense of community and some of the things they do. They have a food pantry for the needy. I agree with the praying and things like that. It just feels like community she could be a part of and kind of like a form of therapy for her. They do speak in tongues and believe everyone should but it's not required.

I made her a praying bench and she decorated a corner of our bedroom to pray in and read/ study the Bible. She reads the Bible several times a day. She reads it to our kids every single day. I don't usually participate in this. Our kids go to church every Sunday and go to church camp. I'm not fully on board with the church camp myself.

I feel awkward every Sunday at the alter calls. I never want to go up there. Once she got me to by crying and begging me in front of everyone so I went. She still pressures me to go to the alter. Never. Some sermons are super awkward. They do a week of resurgence around easter where you go to church every day. There's guest preachers. Everyone is running around, crawling, falling over, screaming and speaking tongues. It was terrifying and made me uncomfortable. 

Now, everything in our home is bible centered. No pg13 movies. We listen to preaching or religious music during every wminute. Half of our weekends are dedicated to God. I feel like my life has become so stressful.

My wife asked me if I believe and I'm saved. I say yes because I don't want to destroy everything. My kids are becoming brainwashed and ask me every night to pray. My wife doesn't bring in money.  She volunteers 2-3 days a week at church. We struggle financially and she wants to tithe money we really need.

I took AP Physics this year. The teacher for that class isn't good, so there were only 7 people in the class. 

My dad offered to tutor me and the other students in the class. For a couple months leading up to the exam, he held a couple review sessions a week at our local library. Four other people in the class attended.

One person who didn't attend is ""Lily"". Lily and I used to be friends, but we had a falling out. I did not invite her to these review sessions. She found out a couple days after the test when someone else mentioned it to her. 

Today we got our scores back. Everyone in the class passed, except for Lily. 

I woke up this morning to a message from her saying that I was being really petty by refusing to let her come to the study sessions and that I sabotaged her. Her parents are angry at her for failing, and she's blaming me for it. After messaging me privately she also messaged our class group chat. All but one of the people there are on her side, people who attended the reviews, and claiming they didn't know she wasn't aware of them. I am being vilified for this, but I don't think she has any right to these study sessions. She could have reviewed on her own, knowing how her parents would likely react.

My daughter is 4 (almost 5) and will go into kindergarten this year. The caretakers at preschool noticed that she will go back and forth on how she pronounces different sounds. For example R is an issue. She will go back and forth pronouncing  the R normally and then change to saying the R like a W. So instead of roof she would say woof.

We did exercises with her and it would help somewhat. 

My brother is in-between job so we are paying him to watch her instead of the daycare. My daughters speech got so much worse since summer started. I noticed that it was she messing up the same sounds that my brother has trouble pronouncing. Anything with R and S Is a big one.

We went on a vacation for about 2 weeks and it basically went away.  It’s clear that she is copying how he pronounces words.

I want to ban him from babysitting since it is impacting how she talks. I do know that he will not take it well.

106,1dybzlt,AITA for not dropping Child Support,"
Throw away account because my family follows may main. Using mobile, excuse the format. 

I have two children Bea and James( 23) from my first marriage. We divorced when the kids were four. In the divorce I got full custody and he was suppose to pay child support plus half medical/dental and every other weekend visitation ( He never showed up to the court proceedings). For the first two years he would sporadically come by to see the children. He rarely paid CS and was locked up a few time for non payment. 
We went back to court and they reduced his child support to 200.00 a month for both kids. He never paid. He owes close to 90k in back child support and obviously he never paid any medical/ dental bills.
I found out a week ago that my ExBIL reached out to James to talk on behalf of my ex. My Ex wants to reconnect( it’s been 17 years)  but he is worried about the back CS that’s owed. James has talked to me and asked me if I would drop the backed owed CS so him and his father can start a relationship. I spoke to my current husband and he said it’s up to me. 
I believe that my ex is just using our son to get the CS dropped.  I doubt I will ever receive any money that’s owed, it’s just the principal of it.  I haven’t told James my decision yet because maybe I’m just being petty. I have spoken with close friends about it that say I would be the AITA if I did not drop the CS case.

FYI: My ex works under the table and also has a wife and a SD that he provides for. He’s been living fine throughout the years he just didn’t want to pay CS. 

Also, he did not reach out to Bea just James. The reason being in my opinion is because Bea is a girl. Bea doesn’t want to have anything to do with him. 

Edit: because of back CS owed my ex has a warrant out. ( he has had that warrant out for years) That’s why he wants me to drop it. I assuming the logic is if I dropped the CS, then the warrant would be void and he would be able to start reconnecting with James. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for not dropping Child Support

I have two children Bea and James( 23) from my first marriage. We divorced when the kids were four. In the divorce I got full custody and he was suppose to pay child support plus half medical/dental and every other weekend visitation ( He never showed up to the court proceedings). For the first two years he would sporadically come by to see the children. He rarely paid CS and was locked up a few time for non payment. 
We went back to court and they reduced his child support to 200.00 a month for both kids. He never paid. He owes close to 90k in back child support and obviously he never paid any medical/ dental bills.
I found out a week ago that my ExBIL reached out to James to talk on behalf of my ex. My Ex wants to reconnect( it’s been 17 years)  but he is worried about the back CS that’s owed. James has talked to me and asked me if I would drop the backed owed CS so him and his father can start a relationship. I spoke to my current husband and he said it’s up to me. 
I believe that my ex is just using our son to get the CS dropped.  I doubt I will ever receive any money that’s owed, it’s just the principal of it.  I haven’t told James my decision yet because maybe I’m just being petty. I have spoken with close friends about it that say I would be the AITA if I did not drop the CS case.

FYI: My ex works under the table and also has a wife and a SD that he provides for. He’s been living fine throughout the years he just didn’t want to pay CS. 

Also, he did not reach out to Bea just James. The reason being in my opinion is because Bea is a girl. Bea doesn’t want to have anything to do with him. 

Edit: because of back CS owed my ex has a warrant out. ( he has had that warrant out for years) That’s why he wants me to drop it. I assuming the logic is if I dropped the CS, then the warrant would be void and he would be able to start reconnecting with James. ",0.0,0.07200540602207184,0,1

I have cats, and I worry about them getting tipped over. My fiancé has already talked to them once about it, mostly because my fiancé knows them better than I do and are closer with them, but also because they used one of my jars to spit in and I got a bit upset (because it was the jar my kids used to give me flowers one day that I was saving for a craft project, and I had to throw it away), so I figured this was not an issue, but I found more after their last visit. 

My issue is; this friend already thinks I’m hard to get along with because I’m an introvert and come across as not very social at times.

109,1dybm70,AITA for leaving my biological father homeless and alone,"My biological father left my mother before I was born. He knew she was pregnant with me but never made any effort to be part of my life in any way, ask how I was doing, or look in on us at all.  6 years ago, I found him on Facebook after several weeks of thinking what I wanted to do, I decided to message him. I made it clear that I didn't want anything from him and had no expectations but would be interested in learning where I come from.

We met for the first time and although a bit on the awkward side, we got along. Over the next few years we started forming a relationship, connecting at the local pub a few times per week, get together with my wife and kids for dinners, holiday events, weekend golf, met his parents, overlapped some of our social circles, etc.  I also learned that he has a daughter and left her and her mother when she was 3, and no longer speaks with most of his family except his parents.

Two years ago, he started having some health issues and was told that he has very serious liver damage (early cirrhosis) and if he stops drinking now, he will have some level of healing and could live another 20 years. If not, he would likely be dead in a year. He decided that he was going to live his life the way he does and continue drinking. It's around this time that he retired and we started spending less and less time together as I did not want my kids seeing all of this (and neither did I honestly). The last Christmas we shared was in 2022 where he was very rude to my wife and really upset my son with a few comments. He meant them in jest, but just did not come off very well especially to a young child. He hasn't seen my family since then, nor has he even asked about them.

His health has got progressively worse and is now full cirrhosis with every complication and symptom that goes with it.  I’ve found out that his father has been paying his rent and given notice to the landlord so I am paying to have movers come, box everything up and put it in short term storage.  This may be a moot point if he doesn’t make it or moved to hospice but if he is released, he has no where to go. I don't feel like I owe him anything, but feel guilty all the same just as a compassionate human being. I've tried to connect with social workers, speak with the hospital about his situation, but pretty sure they just want him out the door to be someone else's problem. If he leaves the hospital or has someone pick him up, I feel I'll have no choice but to block all contact associated with him. I can feel the judgment and guilt all through this from him, hospital staff, his friends, etc that I am not taking care of him.  It’s not a decision out of anger or spite, I just don’t feel any responsibility for him, or the consequences of his choices.

110,1dybh2c,AITA for using weed killer in my garden?,"As the title suggests, my husband is upset I used weed killer in our garden. 

For starters, we have a beautifully landscaped garden that was done by a previous owner. However, they placed river rocks (instead of mulch) over everything so weeding is an absolute nightmare. When we moved into our house five years ago, my husband said he would deal with the outside work if I did the inside work. I've been upholding that agreement but he has always been lax about it. I let it go our entire first year of living in our new house, and the weeds were (no joke) over six feet tall. I was so upset and worried someone was going to call our local ordinance because there is a rule in it that weeds can't be over three feet tall. He laughed about it but eventually trimmed them down. The second and third year of living here, I was taking care of the weeds  by spraying a homemade environmentally safe weed killer on everything. But I was literally out there every other week taking care of the weeds; he was not helping with it at all nor was he doing more inside work to help. The fourth year of living here we had a baby and I didn't have the time to do it, so I bought name brand weed killer and only ended up spraying two times over the spring/summer months. Fast forward to now, the fifth year of living here, and my husband is livid that I am 
spraying weed killer. He is saying how bad it is which I know, so I do my best to make sure it isn't harmful to any of us. I sprayed three days ago and in that time I didn't have our son outside until yesterday, and didn't let him near any place I sprayed. We also have two dogs and when I let them out, I watch them and make sure they weren't anywhere near the sprayed weeds either. 

Well my husband just had a heated discussion with me about how he doesn't like me spraying things within our fenced in area (which is an entire garden). I reminded him that I took the proper procedures to make sure we were all safe. I also reminded him that it was supposed to be his job to do the weeding and that if he doesn't like the spray, then he needs to be on top of it without any reminders, suggestions, etc. from me.

112,1dyb99p,AITA: my friend has taken personal offense to the fact that I go to therapy,"Okay so im gonna try and explain this the best way I can. 
 
 My friend & i  were texting & I had mentioned that I might stop going to therapy because it’s expensive and I have other things I need to pay for right now. But then I said “maybe I’ll just go less, like once a month or something because it’s nice to have someone to talk to.” She said something along the lines of “well you can always talk to friends instead, I’ve told you that before.” I tried talking to my friends about my problems for YEARS and it never got me anywhere. A friend is not equivalent to a therapist by any means. At least not in my opinion. So I said “yeah but friends tend to complain with you and can be biased where as a therapist gives you real solutions, strategies, coping mechanisms, etc”. I thought we were just having a normal, honest conversation &  that is my honest opinion. I like going to therapy. It’s not a miracle worker but it has helped me. My therapist has given me lots of strategies to use for my anxiety & negative situations in my life. 

 So I guess what I said offended her. She then goes “As I said, maybe you’ve gotten what you needed and paid enough to be told the same things that well… that I’ve told ya…… but I’m sorry I haven’t been better aid.” And more guilt tripping sentences dripping with sarcasm. Like girl, you haven’t taught me any strategies for my anxiety, you haven’t taught me about negative thinking patterns, coping mechanisms, etc. My therapist did. That doesn’t make you a bad friend. That makes you a normal friend and a normal person. I wasnt insulting you. I was simply saying I like my therapist. She then says stuff like “I’ve tried to help you but I guess its not good enough, im done trying” and “you’re complaining about not being able to afford therapy meanwhile I can’t afford to eat” like okay? I have a job and you dont. I pay for things with the money I earn. I’m sorry you’re in a bad financial state right now, but that doesn’t mean im not allowed to go to therapy? I genuinely dont understand. 

 She then referred to my therapist as a “professional” in quotations. My therapist obviously went to school for 6 years in order to become one. She has a masters degree and has taken all kinds of classes so that shes able to do this job. That is a professional. No need to be sarcastic about it. 

 It seems to me that shes jealous of my therapist? Because I’d rather talk to her about issues than anyone else. Like I said, talking to friends has never helped me.

I (27M) am the best man in my (27M, ""Matt"") Best friend's wedding. His fiancé (25F ""Hannah"") doesn't like me much, regardless of this I've always been polite to her because she's still my best friend's future wife.

Last night we had his bachelor party. Instead of doing anything big we just decided to hang out with just the two of us (Matt wanted a small wedding, Hannah didn't so they decided on a bigger wedding and Hannah practically picked the rest of Matt's groomsmen) at my apartment drinking, watching movies, and having a good time.

Matt mentioned to me how he was feeling a bit hesitant about actually marrying Hannah. I asked him why and he said it was because he felt she pressured him into it.   I didn't know this but apparently, she's turned into quite the bridezilla and it's stressing Matt out.  According to Hannah, it's ""her day"" not ""their day.""

Matt mentioned how Hannah was trying to convince him to drop me from the wedding entirely in favor of her MOH’s boyfriend.  Matt showed me a conversation they had over text where she said ""I don't think MOH would feel comfortable being paired up with him because he's gay"" 

This upset me, I've been out as gay since I was in my early teens, and my parents didn't take it well so I ended up moving into Matt's house and staying with him and his family until I could get on my feet which I will never be able to thank them enough for.
We talked about this and me and Matt concluded that she doesn't like me because I'm gay and she thinks I'm ""too close"" to Matt.

I asked Matt why he was even marrying her if he was so stressed out and upset with her about this, Matt said he didn't know and that because it was so close he would probably just go along with it.  I told him no and that he needed to have a serious conversation with Hannah about this and then make a choice from there.  He said he'd talk to her about it and I left it at that.

I understand this isn’t my wedding and it’s Matt’s decision to make not mine but I don’t think he should marry her anymore.  WIBTA?",0.0,1.057839035987854,1,0
115,1dyalhm,AITA for cheering too loudly at a primary school’s basketball game?,"
My two friends and I are still in school. Our international school regularly hosts inter-school basketball in our gymnasium, and one day, we went to watch.

The kids participating in this basketball game are significantly younger than us. I’m talking 3rd grade to 5th grade. We were excited, because we wanted to encourage the younger children so we cheered very loudly whenever we got a point. 

Some time into the game, a 3rd grader made a 3-pointer and my friends and I noticed there wasn’t really any reaction from the crowd, so we started screaming, cheering, and yelling encouragement. I referred to the player as “LeBron James Junior” and my friend said this was the start of his basketball career. Further into the game, our school was falling behind, so we tried cheering louder, hoping it would encourage the children.

A parent of one of the girls in our school’s team turned around and glared at us. When we ignored her, she started repeating the phrases se “Are you serious” and “Are you kidding me?” When my friends and I looked confused, she started ranting at us and saying we’d been extremely disrespectful throughout the whole game. 

We didn’t want to argue with a parent, so we kind of just sat there in silence, which turned out to piss the parent off further and causes her to start spewing swear words and profanity at us. She called us immature, and deemed us to be “total pieces of shit with no sense of awareness.” 

At this point we felt no need for this one-sided argument to continue, so we just got up quietly and left. Apparently, our silent resignation was not enough, so she emailed the school and described in all kinds of ways how we had been racist, mean, and vulgar (to name a few.) 

We were called to the principals office, and scolded with an email sent our parents. We were not given a chance to defend ourselves and were yelled at for trying to speak up and explain what had really happen from our point of view. After this, my friends and I went back into the office and told the principal that the lady had swore at us and exhibited innapropriate behaviour. They said they’d look into it.

The next day, the principal had taken our side after a few angry and confrontational 
emails from our parents, who were, undoubtedly pissed off, and tried to get the lady to apologise to us. She refused and said it was ridiculous and we couldn’t force her to do anything she didn’t want to.

From my POV, my friends and I did nothing wrong. I agree that we were being a little bit too enthusiastic, but as I grew up in the US I have always assumed this is the way to cheer at sports games. I admit I should have toned it down for a school game, but I don’t think the parent should have exploded like that

116,1dyai3o,WIBTA if I dont go to my friend’s party because she ditched us?,"I (23F) just graduated university with two of my friends and my girlfriend (we were all classmates). Both of our friends have been planning on holding a party to celebrate the graduation for MONTHS. 
The first friend (21F), lets call her Jane, had her party last weekend with a bunch of family and friends from outside of school, where me and my girlfriend showed up, even though it was 1,5 hours away from us. Well, when we showed up, Jane showed us a text our other friend (24F), lets call her Anne, sent her. The content of the message was basically ‘sorry but I cant make it to your party because I have to help out my family with work on their property. It would be weird of me to not help them since they are throwing my party next weekend’. 
First off, I compeletely understand Anne wanting to help her family since the property they need help with is the place where she will hold her party, and also it is family, I would want to help them too if they asked me. Where my issue comes in, is that she has been ditching our things for as long as we have known her. Not always, but frequently enough to be hurtful now. Around 6 months ago when me and my girlfriend moved in together, Anne didnt show up for our housewarming and she had a completely fair reason since she is very allergic to our cat, but she promised to schedule something else together which never happened.
Also, as I mentioned, both Anne and Jane have been planning their parties for months and months, so for her to ditch it last minute shows me that she thinks hers is more important than Jane’s. 

Another recent incident was my girlfriend going to a festival about two weeks ago where Anne was also there, which was part of the reason why my girlfriend bought a ticket. They talked about being together at times during the festival, especially at 2 concerts. They were not each other’s main group but they both said they wanted to hang out during the 3 days. Well, girlfriend was texting her during the first day, no reply. Second day, she finally got a reply and they briefly met up for 1 concert but then nothing again. My girlfriend was super sad and felt rejected by Anne which makes me reconsider Anne as a person and friend as well.


Where I might be the asshole is that this whole party has been planned for months, just as Jane’s was and I dont want to stoop to Anne’s level and come across petty. She has accomodation for everyone and is looking forward to it a lot. 
Why I dont want to show up is not as revenge, but because I already feel dissapointed by Anne and dont know what to say to her and we are not even at the party yet. 

So please Reddit help me out and tell me WIBTA if I dont show up?

117,1dyabu6,AITA for leaving the restaurant with my kids while my parents were visiting,"I’ve never had a great relationship with my dad. I’ve never been able to have my own thoughts, feelings, or opinions. I’ve been called names for holding different beliefs and overall it’s been rough trying to figure out who I am as an adult. My mom and I have a better relationship but she co-signs his behavior. She says “you have to love people where they’re at and that’s just the way he is”

I moved to OK about 4 years ago. My parents live in AZ. I have 5 kids and do things differently than my parents. I don’t discuss politics or religion with my dad if I can help it. I can have those discussions with my mom because we’re able to listen to each other. My dad is a different story. I get called stupid, a dumba**, brainwashed, or worse. I do my best to avoid anything remotely political. sometimes things that aren’t political end up being political with him. 

My parents came to visit and last night was their last night in town. We went to dinner and overall the visit was ok. We had a couple small incidents but I had kept my mouth shut/ignored it. While we were at dinner, we were on one of the safer topics with my dad, which is movies/TV shows. I brought up the “interview with the vampire series.” admittedly I have not seen it but wanted to. My mom likes interview with the vampire and I wanted to ask her if she had watched it. She is actually the one who got me into Anne Rice. Before my mom had a chance to answer, my dad cut her off and said “we aren’t going to be watching that.” 

I was a little confused and asked why. 
he said, in front of everyone in the restaurant and in front of my kids
“because. It’s a f** show.” 
I was shocked and said “dad!!” 
he said “what?” gestured to the restaurant behind him, then said, “I don’t care who heard me it’s the truth.” 
I said “well I care and I don’t want that kind of language used around my kids.” 
Too which he replied “oh so your kids can run around saying oh my God, but I can’t say f**?” my reply to that was 
“we are not a religious family” I wanted to say more but got very anxious. 
similar interactions have become very nasty. I didn’t want to make a scene. 

I had talked to my kids about what they could and could not say in front of my parents. I also corrected them and so had my parents anytime if they said it in front of them. 

He then said “if your kids can run around saying “oh my God”, I don’t see what the problem is with what I’m saying. It’s a f** show.”

I got up, took my kids and left. 
My mom called later and pretty much defended him. She said my kids had been disrespectful and we were both in the wrong. She called me prideful and stubborn. 
She said that I could have a conversation with my dad to try and resolve it. I laughed and told her to sit down with him and have a conversation with him about anything he deemed controversial and let me know how it went. She didn’t have much to say after that. 
I’m feeling very conflicted, but this is not the first time he has done something like this.

118,1dya4r4,AITAH for getting offended at my friends joke?,"It was basically a huge fight that we both started from a small conversation.

It started when I began talking about an essay I made about neurodivergent people (for those that don't know, people with conditions like Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, etc.) And basically about how they have potential to benefit society. I mentioned how I don't like the term ""disabled"" for them as they ""simply have different skill sets"", in my words. He then said ""Nope! It's a disability! You guys are disabled!"". As someone with Autism and ADHD (and he knows this fully), this joke hurt me. I then said that this is why I never try to have mature conversations with him, but he then said that ""If society doesn't use neurodivergent people, then aren't they useless?""

I then proceeded to call him dumb for this statement, and this started a back and forth for a while of just insulting each other. He berated me for taking things too seriously and being insecure, while I berated him for taking nothing seriously and having a massive ego. I proceeded to try and tell him my point again, but he continued to say that neurodivergent skills are useless because society doesn't use them. 

He then told me that he doesn't take me seriously because I'm always insecure, and that I need to learn to take a joke. This set me off a bit, and I yelled a bit about how not every conversation calls for humor, especially not ableist jokes in conversations about ableism. He then told me that I was being mean first (even though he was the one who made that offensive joke after I talked about my essay on ableism). He told me that I was forcing the conversation on them for talking about it a lot, and I responded by saying that if he wasn't interested, he could have said so instead of making such a offensive joke. 

That's where the conversation ends for now. I know I wasn't the complete good guy here, but I feel very disrespected by him and it oftentimes feels like he treats me like a joke.

120,1dy9umd,AITA for telling my mom she shouldn’t attend martial arts classes with me?,"I (17F) recently took up an unnamed japanese martial art- it’s something i have been looking into for months in order to better my discipline, self defense and strength. I’ve been involved in sports and weightlifting for many years now, but learning a martial art is something that’s always been a dream for me.

My mother (40-something F) was looking for an outlet for exercise, so I suggested she join me for the first couple of classes/sessions in order to fulfill that. In the most respectful way possible… this martial art is a much higher intensity level than her normal activities, and it manifests heavily during the synchronized training when we have to slow down for her and pause for the instructor to fix her form.

I believe that learning martial arts should be for everyone and that anyone can improve, but the problem comes in with her reactions. Her sense of humor is one of the biggest reasons I love her, but sometimes it’s disruptive to the strong system of respect that has been established in the gym. She often jokes about the ceremonial aspects of it, specifically the recitation of Japanese phrases. I can tell that it ticks off the more advanced members (some with over 20 years of experience) when they give her looks, but I most fear that they’ll associate that disrespect with me as well.

Another thing is the discrepancy in how seriously we take it. She has stated multiple times (to the rest of the class) that she is only there to burn calories; which is a very valid goal elsewhere like a pilates or kickboxing class, but not very fitting in this environment built on tradition, culture and learning. She has asked me numerous times why I didn’t pick an activity that would be “easier” on her like yoga or some type of dance, but she has a hard time getting when i explain that i wanted to join this sport for ME. I have tried to encourage her to take up a class in something she’s actually passionate about so she will have fun while meeting her weight goals, but every time she finds a way to turn it into an argument about “being embarrassed of her”. I truly want her to be healthier, but i don’t want her to waste her and the dojo’s time with this activity

She’s my sole provider for the most part, however i am in the stage of transferring the responsibility of funding to myself as i’ll be going to college in less than a year. I wanted part of this stage to be finding an activity i could do and fund independently with my job. These are fairly cheap classes that i can afford on a high schooler’s minimum wage salary, so that’s not a problem in this situation.

Am i selfish for wanting her to stop participating? Is it my place to decide whether she’s a good fit for this activity? How could I bring this up in a gentler way as not to hurt her feelings?

A week after, we got a little male puppy, and every name he's been giving him I found it horrible. I know it's subjective and I don't feel like I need to give details about the names, but what I think is that he should also take me into consideration and come up with a different one if I say I don't like it. I gave a few suggestions which I think were brilliant, but he didn't even say whether he liked them or not, he just said that he didn't want me to take that decision because I had already named the cat.

Now he's upset that I still don't fully accept the last name he decided for the dog. I really tried calling him that during the weekend but it just doesn't work for me.

123,1dy8xk1,AITA for refusing to attend my sister's wedding after she secretly dated and got engaged to my ex-fiancé?,"Alright Reddit, buckle up, because this is a rollercoaster.

I (28F) was engaged to my ex-fiancé ""Mike"" (30M) for two years. We were together for five years in total and were supposed to get married last summer. About three months before our wedding, I found out that he had been cheating on me with someone else. It was devastating, and I called off the wedding immediately. Mike moved away shortly after we broke up, and I thought that was the end of it. I was heartbroken, but I slowly started to move on with my life. Fast forward to last month, I get a call from my younger sister ""Lily"" (25F) saying she has exciting news and wants me to come over to our parents' house for dinner to share it. When I arrived, Lily and my parents were all smiles, and she drops the bombshell: she’s engaged. To Mike. My head was spinning. I felt like I was going to pass out. Lily and Mike had been secretly dating for the past year, and now they were engaged. My parents had known about it for months but decided to keep it from me to ""protect my feelings."" They actually thought I'd be happy for them eventually. Lily tried to justify it by saying she and Mike fell in love after our breakup and that their relationship is meant to be. She insisted that they didn't start dating until after we were officially over, but I felt betrayed on so many levels. I told them all that I wanted nothing to do with their wedding and stormed out. Since then, my parents and Lily have been bombarding me with calls and texts, calling me selfish and saying I'm overreacting. They claim that true love is rare and I should be supportive of Lily's happiness. Now, the wedding is in a few months, and the pressure is on. My parents have even threatened to cut me off financially if I don't attend. Some friends think I should go to keep the peace and show I'm over it, while others are appalled and say I have every right to be angry and to stay away. To add insult to injury, Lily recently asked if I would be her maid of honor, claiming she wants to mend our relationship. This request has left me torn—I don't want to ruin our family dynamic further, but I can't shake the hurt and betrayal I feel.

124,1dy8ol5,AITA?? Bf/gf argument ,"My gf and I went shopping this weekend. She ended up buying perfume from a store, after we left the store we realized the perfumes were completely overpriced vs online. We decided to go back to the store and get a refund.

When we got back to the stores probably (2 mins after purchase) the employees had a bad attitude and repeatedly stated there is a no refund policy, and that we could exchange for something else. 

This angered my gf, and she started yelling at the worker and the manager who both had attitude. My gf argued that it was unjust and since we just purchased 2 mins ago they should take it back. The manager walked away, leaving the employee to talk with us. My gf continued to get more angry, yelling and about how unfair their store was and how it’s a scam.

My gf was yelling at the employees for about 5-10 mins. All throughout I was asking her to stop, so I could talk told to the employee and see if an exception could be made.  She ignored my comments asking her to stop yelling. After 10 mins, I yelled at her saying “stop yelling at the employee, she didn’t do anything wrong” as she seemed to be a young entry level worker with no authority to make any difference.

My gf then stopped yelling, I then tried to make an exchange but she demand we just leave.

After leaving the store, my gf says she’s embarrassed that I yelled at her, mad at me for defending the worker, and that I should always be on her side even if I believe she is wrong.

Her rational, I should not have taken the side of the worker, should not have yelled at her. My gf (as a customer) has a right to yell at the worker since she made the purchase and is unsatisfied.

My rational, I wanted to stop the conflict as everybody was staring. I wanted to talk with employee to find a solution in a respectful manner. I wanted to get a refund and get her out of the store as this was truly embarrassing to be part of. 

My gf continues to argue with me that I was not her side and took the side of the employee and that she cannot trust me. She states I did not act like a man, but acted as a loser..

I’ve told my gf, it’s not right to yell at workers and in the end they won’t want to help us if we are rude and angry.  I mentioned it’s completely immature to yell at them since we are adults (over 30 YO)

She has been threatening to end our relationship, and says the only solution to solve this is to go back to the store and yell at the workers for disrespecting her. I believe this is so immature and that I was trying to stop the conflict and find a solution to refund.

125,1dy8oep,AITA for telling my stepdaughter I don’t want to watch any fucking kids and that includes yours ,"I have never wanted kids. I was forced to watch my younger siblings (4 of them) until I left at the age of 16. I greatly dislike babysitting and never had my own children. Never have been comfortable around young kids after that.

My husband has three children, I met and married him when his kids were in their 20s. I am not a mother figure to them at all, just their dad’s wife. Overall I got along well with the three adults.

The problem started when my Kelly became pregnant. Everyone was excited for the first baby in the family. I made it clear I didn’t want to babysit and when grandkids were around my husband was to be the main caretaker. My husband agreed.

The first two years went great, my husband is an awesome grandpa and I am fine being the relative that brings toys and other fun stuff once in a while. 

Kelly has been pushing hard for me to take up a more traditional grandma role. Her MIL isn’t involved ( she lives a few states over). Kelly has gotten in her head that I should be doing the babysitting instead of her father. We have talked to her multiple times. 

My husband is on a work trip and will be back next week. Usually he babysits on Monday but he informed her that he won’t be there so it was canceled. She stopped over and was dropping her kids off.

I asked what she was doing since her dad wasn’t here. She told me that I need to step up and babysit. That she doesn’t care if her dad isn’t here, I am present. I told her no.

This went in circles for a bit and got more heated the longer we went. I told her I don’t want to watch any fixing kids and that includes yours. She is pissed.

My husband is fine with what I did but his other children are on his ass.

126,1dy83gq,AITA for honestly telling my mother about my thoughts on spending her money,"EDIT: my mother apologised for it and we're good now.
context: i F17 recently had this conversation with my mother about a hypothetical scenario. My mother does not buy me or my brother M18 gifts for our birthdays and usually takes us out for a good meal. 
This year, she decides to buy my brother a watch (about a $100), and  my brother plans to sell off the old watch he has and paid for himself in the past and keep the money. My mother asked what I'd do and I said I'd do exactly the same. She then went on saying she didn't expect me to behave like that and how someone like me (who she deems as someone who's not materialistic) wouldn't have had this thinking and would instead offer to give the money (made from selling the old watch) back to her. I retorted saying that I do help her to save on financial expenses on a daily basis and she got really unhappy. I knew she'd have this sort of expectation that Id somehow declare Id return the money but I decided to be honest about how I feel that it's right to keep the money since the new watch she bought is a gift.
She then said she did not raise me and my brother to be like this and went on saying how fortunate we were compared to other families while being really really worked up and angry which I don't see the rational. we then split ways for the day (she decided to ignore me) and till now after a long day, theres still tension

127,1dy7tb2,AITA for asking my husband to distance himself from a school friend?,"My (33F) husband (34M) recently completed a nursing program and grew close to one of the girls (22F) in his class. 

He’s said he think she’s hot and pretty cool. This isn’t weird in our relationship, we talk about people being attractive pretty frequently. 

The issue started when he lied about who he was with while completing a group project. I asked him how it went and he paused for a brief moment before talking about it. 

The pause was weird behavior for him and I couldn’t get it out of my head. I checked his phone and found out it was just him and the girl - the third party member couldn’t make it. 

I asked why he lied and he said he didn’t want me to worry. 

Time goes on, and I find some flirty messages (mild flirting - nothing explicit) that he had deleted. 

I asked him about it and he denies deleting the messages. Our son plays with our phones so maybe he deleted the messages somehow. 

My husband is a fairly reserved guy and isn’t known to start or go out of his way for conversation. 

He had sent her a picture of store sign that had her name on it - thinking it was funny and wanted to share it. 

By this point I’ve made it pretty clear I’m uncomfortable with the interactions and we’ve even gone to counseling (one session) about it. 

He explains he doesn’t think we need counseling and that I’m reading too far into these things. 

Months go by, I begin to trust the situation is harmless, and he graduates. I meet her and her mom and she seems really nice. 

The texting picks back up but I’m okay with it because it’s largely just discussing professional related items. They don’t work together, they just completed the same professional training. 

Until he messages her happy Fourth of July while he was hanging out with my family and our close friends.  

He didn’t message anyone else happy fourth - only her. 

Again, my husband isn’t known for texting or talking to people. His family and friends frequently complain that they wished he reached out more. 

So, I see a red flag. 

I get upset and ask for the reasoning. He said he thinks she’s cool and wants to be her friend. 

I ask him what does that friendship look like. He says he doesn’t know. I ask what do they have in common? He doesn’t know. 

I asked him he if thought I would be uncomfortable with them texting, he said yes. I asked him why he would message her then - he said he thought since I met her I would be more comfortable with them talking. 

I said I thought their friendship was inappropriate and I wasn’t comfortable with it. 

I know a large portion of these feelings are stemming from a lack of self worth and jealousy - am I the asshole for asking my husband to limit his contact with this friend?


UPDATE:

Well, I found a lot of y’all’s messages really encouraging - I brought up the situation again. He said he didn’t agree but understood and said he would not speak with her again. 

I want to note, he didn’t offer that our son deleted the messages he stated he wasn’t sure how the messages were deleted. I offered that possible excuse (which no matter what is still very sketchy). 

He does think a 30 something man can be friends with a 20 year old. He mentioned some things they have in common. I still disagree. 

I requested he find us a couples counselor to talk about it in a safer space and he made the appointment.

I've been trying to convince him to let them come but he just won't listen. His parents, who are the hosts, are fine with it and my mother-in-law is thankfully taking my side and trying to convince him too so fingers crossed he does change his mine before we leave.

My girlfriend and I went out for drinks with a couple of her friends at the weekend. I had met these friends before and they knew I had been in hospital and know why I was there.

Things started off well, they asked how I was and I told them I was fine and just glad to get back to normal. One of the kept bringing up the hospital stay saying how boring and awful it must have been being stuck in hospital. I just said I didn't want to talk about it and that I was glad to be out.

She then started asking if I had to change my lifestyle much and I again just said I didn't want to talk about it. She questioned if drinking could affect my medication and whether I should be drinking alcohol at all.

 I got annoyed at this point and told her that I have come out to enjoy myself, not sit and talk about my hospital stay and that I'm leaving if she is just going to keep questioning me. 

She argued that she was just concerned but I just pointed out she ignored my repeated point of not wanting to discuss it and that my hospital stay is none of her business. At that point she said she was leaving and we all ended up just going home. 

My girlfriend was annoyed at me and said I shouldn't have snapped at her friend but I just pointed out that I didn't go out to be interrogated, I just wanted to enjoy my night. My girlfriend said she'd like me to apologise but I refused.

132,1dy750h,AITA for not sharing food I got with my own money with some people in my orchestra after a massive dispute we had a few months ago?,"I, 17M am currently rehearsing for a summer concert at my school. The Year 13s (most of whom are 18 years old) have all left after they finished their A Levels but came back for the rehearsals.

When they were here, three came into a silent studying room and began being loud. I asked them multiple times to stop but under the guise of it being ‘group work’ they got out of any trouble they could’ve been in for their rowdiness. 

Then I got made the bad guy when I moved their stuff to another table in the room because I wanted to stay by the window as at the time, it was really hot and the rooms at our school have no air con. The way I saw it, why did I have to move from where I was comfortable to accommodate inconsiderate people? They got mad and an argument broke out and one of them even began to invade my personal space.

The next day they came back to argue over the blinds of a window next to me being closed as it ‘made reading the screen on the laptop harder’. Everyone I spoke to about this agrees it was a bs reason to argue as having the blinds open would impede their ability to read more than if they were closed. I said I knew it was about the day before, not about the blinds and they made comments about my family and tried to accuse me of being a predator because I talk to people in younger year groups even though the only people I talk to in younger year groups are the siblings of close friends in my grade. They also tried to accuse me of racism even though I am the same race as one of the people involved. Then as I was about to respond, I was asked to ‘back down and show grace during exam season and drop it’ after they came instigating. I clapped back by calling out the girl who said this for cheating on her boyfriend and said she can’t talk about grace and morals when she didn’t have enough grace and morals to stay faithful. I went to the other and said to worry about her boyfriend who’s been involved in shady business before she worries about me. It got worse from here with my words being twisted.

Staff got involved and I was given a verbal warning to not discuss it again or I’d face exclusion. They said to me it was a large group against me and there weren’t enough people to corroborate my story even though I gave a list of witnesses to them. I asked my friends after if the staff who were investigating the incident spoke to them and it was a unanimous no. My guess is because the teacher is openly pally with them, they didn’t investigate thoroughly. Meanwhile, lies about what I said continued to spread but I had been silenced.

I’m still not over what happened because of all the lies and how the teacher didn’t even follow up with the people who I named as witnesses.

133,1dy71tv,AITA If my best friend doesn't believe that mental illness is. Real,"So me 22M and my friend (we'll call him Joe) is 22M had a rough argument because of my mental health problems.

I'm diagnosed with depression and C-PTSD and I'm currently seeing a therapist and just started anti depressants 4 days ago (they are doing wonders tbh so fast). I've had these issues for most of my life but I tended to ignore them and just power through until I couldn't anymore.

My problems started getting infinitely worse when my father passed away 2 years ago and I found out he was dead and his body in quite a traumatic state. For the longest time, the images haunted me but it's getting better, much better when I started therapy.

Joe has a problem where he doesn't beleive in mental health problems (even though he has many of them such as anger management issues, stress induced migraines, and workahilism). He tends to put all his self worth on his achievements and work. That's just the kind of person he is.

He currently lives in a different country than I do so most of our texts are online.

Last night, I was messaging him and he just lashed out at me telling me that I'm not out much effort anymore into the relationship and that for lack of better words a husk of my former self because I'm there but I'm not present.

He said that I need to snap out of this depression and ptsd bullshit (his words) and get back to work and get a grip. He also constantly my mental health problems as not that bad.

I keep trying to communicate with him but he always leaves me on read. I try t engage in conversation and he either gets annoyed or again, leaves me on read saying “I don't have anything to add or say”. I usually send him a political post telling me to check this out or ask about him or send a meme.

He told me that he doesn't want to talk about himself to me and last night he mentioned that it's hard to share his life with me because I'm depressed. He refuses to share anything so I'm confused.

When we voice call, he usually focuses on work and we don't talk or do anything. Just him working.

He wasn't always like this and was a lot more endaged but he started acting like to his recently, I presume because I'm depressed according to him.

For the longest time I was confused by his actions but I thought he was just battling his own demons.

I was quite shocked by what happened last night and saying the things he said that I stated above. I found his behavior to be quite shocking, appalling and childish.

Never would I gave expected this to be the reason for all of this.

I made sure to voice all my concerns to him and explained how I felt and he well just left me on read even though I sent long, descriptive and serious texts to him.

This whole situation makes me feel really sad because I do care about him and I want I engage more but it's hard because sometimes I just can't and when he doesn't respond it makes me want to try even less.

136,1dy6low,AITA over a typo l sent a girl ,"Am I the asshole?

I'm 20 years old and met my boyfriend at my childhood best friend's party. I didn't really know anyone else at the party, so I got acquainted with a girl I met that day—let's call her Stacey. Stacey later introduced me to some of her male friends, but only one caught my attention. I asked Stacey if she could introduce us, but she kept refusing and giving me excuses like, ""Oh, I will introduce you another time."" Eventually, I just walked up to him and talked to him. A few months later, he became my boyfriend.

His birthday was close by, and I had planned everything. The last step was to tell his sister in case she wanted to spend the day with him. She then told me she also wanted to spend the day with him, so I made our date a combined lunch with his friends and family. His sister said she would invite two people close to him: a friend and a cousin. She invited his best friend, Adam. Stacey wasn't invited because his sister doesn't like her and gave me permission to invite someone from my side, so I invited my best friend.

On the day of the event, Stacey messaged me asking if I did anything for his birthday, which I found a bit weird because she's friends with Adam and can view my story. I also thought she was friends with my boyfriend, so she could see his as well. I told her what happened, but I told her this the next day. I forgot to mention she sent lots of laughing emojis without giving me context as to why she was laughing and it did upset me at some point because l thought that maybe my boyfriend didn't like how l celebrated his birthday.I made a typo in one of the messages when I was explaining that I got him a saxophonist and other gifts—I had spelled the word ""saxophonist"" incorrectly. She screenshotted the whole conversation and put it on her story.

I ended up telling her I didn't really like it because it was a typo, and I found it embarrassing. I didn't want my boyfriend to see it, and she told me that the problem is I am not secure in my relationship and that it was hilarious. Eventually, I just confronted her, but she still found it funny and told me I need to trust my partner. Eventually, I just ghosted her and told my boyfriend about it. When I next saw him, he told me that Stacey wasn't his friend but more of Adam's friend so he wasn't really mad at my reaction but quite disappointed with how she didn't handle the situation in a mature way and that day l found out he doesn't even see Stacy's social media posts because they aren't friends on any social media platforms.

Mia kept her phone under her pillow to guarantee that she wouldn’t miss her mom’s call if she decided to call back—she didn’t. After we fell asleep, I heard someone knocking at our door at about 1 AM, so I went to check it out. To my surprise, it was one of our teachers in charge of the camp. She asked us if Mia and I were in our room, and I said yes, confirming to her by showing her that Mia was asleep. She went and called Mia’s mom before abruptly leaving.

Mia then woke up at around 4 AM, waking me up after. We checked the messages her mom had sent her, and they read that she was really pissed and the camp was considering expelling Mia and I. Mia then texted her mom, telling her mom that she didn’t confirm anything. Then it was breakfast time, and we had a small gathering and the teacher that went into our room told everyone that we snuck out and blamed us for them knocking on everyone’s doors, subsequently waking them up to find us.

We later found out that this was all due to a misunderstanding. They had knocked on our door at 10 PM, but because we had fallen asleep, we didn’t answer. Because Mia’s mom thought that Mia promised to call at 1 AM, she thought that we snuck out and got kidnapped. 

By now, it was around 8 AM and everyone in the group was downstairs and ready to leave for an activity. The lead of the organization in charge of the whole thing then explained to everyone about the dangers of going outside, with impregnation being listed as an example. One girl named J (19F) then said, “You could be pregnant right now.” Remember that we didn’t actually sneak outside. She also mentioned some things about how it was extremely important to keep your promises, and that if you say you’re going to call your parents at a certain time, then you’d better do it. She also said that if your parents have high blood pressure and they worry about you, they could have a heart attack and pass away.

Then, another one of our group members, Sam (19M), who is an unofficial leader of sorts that leads the guys, said that we should be punished. The lead then said that if we “played this joke another time,” we would be expelled and would have to be sent home.

I’m not really sure how to feel. I get that they’re worried about my safety and I appreciate that, but all of this seems overboard. But at the same time, all of these older people who probably know better agree with their decision, so I wanna know: AITA?

I kept my sunglasses on my head because I wasn’t planning on getting my hair wet anyway.

When I made clear I really liked them and found them in a vintage shop so I couldn’t just buy them again, which I felt bad about because they were the only sunglasses I felt confident in, he did say sorry. Afterwards I asked if he’d be okay with buying me new ones for the summer holiday, but he said no, and that it was an unreasonable thing to ask since he didn’t make me lose them on purpose. AITA?

140,1dy5ip8,"AITA for refusing to sign the sublease agreement, when my friend has already signed the lease agreement for our apartment?","A friend and I are going to start studying and we've decided to move in together. We have now found an apartment that we would need a third roommate for. Now, our studies are going to start in about two months and it doesn't look like we are going to find a third person. The problem: My friend has already signed the lease agreement. Now that I've realised that finding a third person is probably not going to happen, I don't want to sign the sublease agreement until we've found someone because, of course, I don't want to pay half the rent for a third person.

Now, here's my issue with this whole situation:

* My friend always strove for perfection. He only wanted the perfect apartment, while I didn't care too much about that. Whenever I've sent him apartments (I've probably sent him about 10-15 options) that were - trust me - totally fine, he would always find the tiniest thing (things like the colour of the floor/ the way the kitchen looks) and instantly dismiss the apartments, which made it incredibly difficult to find something with him. There were literally only like 5 apartments - all of them rather expensive - from his and my research combined, that he found to be ok.
* He lied to me about his budget and tried to gaslight me. In the beginning he told me that his budget was (I'm gonna slightly change these numbers) 1300/m. Long before we even started searching I told him that my budget was 900/m max. When we found a person that was willing to almost pay the price for the third room (missing 50 dollars), I asked him, if he could go up a little (he isn't even close to paying 1300) because he said his budget was 1300. He then said that he never said his budget was 1300 and that this was his budget for living alone. Now, obviously this is a bullshit excuse. Why would his budget for living alone be higher? Also, why did he tell me his budget for living alone and not for living together, when we obviously want to move in together? Now, of course, he doesn't have to pay more than he wants, but he's obviously trying to gaslight me, which is not ok.
* He also said that I said that my budget was originally 950, which I can't remember saying that, but it could be true. What I can remember though, is that long before we even started searching for an apartment I made it clear to him, that my budget was 900.
* I told him from the beginning that it would be hard to find someone for that apartment, since it is quite expensive, but he insisted that there wouldn't be a problem. Now he's realising that there indeed is going to be a problem.

I know that what I'm doing doesn't show solidarity but I also have to protect myself and my parents who are the ones paying for this whole thing.

143,1dy4wcl,AITA for wanting my boyfriends childhood nanny out of our house?,"Hi. I am a female with a long time boyfriend. During pandemic, we decided to find a house that we can afford.
Coincidentally, the place where we found our house is just 30 mins away from my partner's childhood
nanny, and they're still in contact. She says that she will visit when we are all settled in our new home. We started living there at around Feb 26 and the nanny
visited March 1 same year. It's all good at the start thinking that she will just be there for a maximum of two weeks. Sadly, I'm wrong. Three months passed and she's still there. I asked my partner, ""I thought she will just be visiting but it's already three
months, and she's still here. When is she gonna go home?"". He says he doesn't know. She does most of the housework. She says that it's normal for her to do that everyday.
On the sixth month, she's still there. We are afraid to tell her to move out because she is an old woman and we will look and feel awful if we tell her to move
out. We decided to give her monthly allowance as she's doing almost all the house work. We are working on our jobs (WFH). Mind you that
we don't tell her what to do, she just do it out of
her own accord. We are just free to do things after work. Two years passed and my annoyance to
her started to grow. There are several reasons. First,
there are decisions in the house that my partner
and I have disagreement with and she also has her
own opinion on those matters. I think that those matters should only be settled between the couple.
Second, she likes to collect junk. She likes to collect
instant noodles cup that she uses as drinking cup even though we have a number of drinking glasses at home. She also collects the big mineral water
bottles from the neighbor to use as water jug even if
we already have two water jugs at home. It came to
a point that we already have five jugs from neighbor
and our own two water jugs, so a total of seven. It's
a pain to see as those are unnecessary things to
collect, two is enough. I asked the neighbor
to not give their empty mineral water bottles to
her and they agreed. Third, I am unable to move in the living
room/kitchen because she murmurs all the time.
She sleeps in the living room because the second bedroom is upstairs and she's old and it's hard to go up and down every time. Understandable, but when
I try to cook, or do something in the kitchen, She's
non-stop murmuring. Also, she's sometimes singing
something like when I'm cooking, she sings ""She's cooking, she's cooking"". I think she doesn't know that she's
speaking already or singing what's on her mind. It's
hella annoying and because of that, I only go down when I am about to go to office, to restroom or to eat.
Fourth, I learned that she keeps on telling our neighbor that I don't do house work (check third reason why). There's a lot more to type but I am out of chars.

non-stop murmuring. Also, she's sometimes singing
something like when I'm cooking, she sings ""She's cooking, she's cooking"". I think she doesn't know that she's
speaking already or singing what's on her mind. It's
hella annoying and because of that, I only go down when I am about to go to office, to restroom or to eat.
Fourth, I learned that she keeps on telling our neighbor that I don't do house work (check third reason why). There's a lot more to type but I am out of chars. AITA",1.0,1.0330967903137207,1,1
144,1dy4tyl,AITA for suggesting my fiancé goes back to work at a job he hates?,"For context, I 22F have been with my fiancé 21M for four years. Over the course of these four years, I have watched him go from being a college student to dropping out, and trying to figure out what he wants do with his life. Following dropping out of school, he attended a trade program which helped him get certifications to do some factory work. 

After completing the two month program he was in, he held a job about 20-25 minutes away from where we live and he was there for a year before leaving that company (it was a shithole company and I knew he was unhappy) to go to another one in a different town with better pay. There he learned how to operate a different machine and was overall just happier. 

In March he was let go from the new company. We didn’t see this coming so it was quite a shock. Over the course of the 8 months he was there, he was ridden quite hard by his manager primarily because the factory was a very quantity pushing facility. The old company never really rode his ass the way the new one did so he never had to worry about producing what a place wanted.

Since he got fired in March, he has been applying like crazy to jobs. Now I know the job market is not what it used to be but after putting in over 100 applications to different places myself and his mom figured he would have a job by now. At first it wasn’t a big deal because we both live with our moms and he’s able to go work for his grandparents doing construction around their home. But now that money is running out, and his unemployment benefits will soon be over, time is running 

I suggested he go back to the other company he hated because he needs a job. I sat down with him yesterday and talked him for the 3rd time about it because he needs something. He has a car payment, insurance, phone, and water bill he needs to pay. We both currently live with our moms so you would think this isn’t a huge deal… well they have both given us a hard deadline to move out so they can move to their dream states. We’re now in the middle of the year and I’m worried the longer he is out of work, the harder it’s gonna be for us to secure a loan next year. We also were going to open a joint bank account so we could start saving for a down payment. 

When I talked to him yesterday he was still at a hard no and that he feels like I’m trying to make him unhappy by applying to a place that did nothing but cause him stress… he is currently working on obtaining his real estate license but that won’t be completed for another two months. Even then, it will be rough for him just starting out. So AITA for even suggesting that he go back to his old job? 

EDIT: Since it’s been asked I decided to update my post. I am currently a full time college student and also work full time as an optometry technician. We just recently got engaged and I have asked him to hold off on planning the wedding until I graduate and am in an administrator in training program for a future job. I left this out because it’s not important. I am not paying bills for two of us and I don’t make the best money but it’s something. We still live with our moms so we don’t pay rent but have our own separate bills. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-08,"AITA for suggesting my fiancé goes back to work at a job he hates?

146,1dy4ifn,AITA for getting mad when I can hear my parents having sex?,"
Here is some context-

I (14f) have trouble sleeping at night (I wouldn’t call it insomnia but is close to that), my parents (43f) and (42m) know this. I usually fall asleep around 12-2am, but at least 1-2 times a week I can hear my parents have sex, I know this is normal for adults to do, and and I’m not saying I never want them to have sex again it’s just i can hear it loud and clear, and it really disgusts me (they have carpeted floors and a bed that doesn’t make any noise, but i can hear my mom moaning really loud). Some nights the noise level is fine, and I just put on some music in my ear buds, but most nights it is so bad I can hear her even with my earbuds blasting music on full volume. 

One night I was asleep and she was so loud she woke me up from sleeping, which usually I sleep through most loud noises, but this was so loud it woke me up and I didn’t fall asleep until 7am.

Another time it was so loud I went upstairs to escape the noise and I just watched some TV until it was over, but I could still hear her from there even with the TV on.

I told my mom one night that she was being really loud and that I could hear them do it all the time, but she just denied that she was being loud and told me it was normal. I’m to scared to tell my dad because he gets really mad at me when I bring up anything he is doing wrong.

Most of the time I just deal with it and put my earbuds in, but when I literally cant cancel out the noise it really bothers me, to the point where I’m crying and really mad at them. 

I know it is normal to hear your parents doing it once or twice but I hear it a lot (mostly because I don’t fall asleep until really late. which could be considered my fault, but I can’t help that I can’t fall asleep) I just want them to be quieter and more considerate of my sleep, since I try my best every night to fall asleep as fast as I can. I know it might be hard for them to find other time to do it since I don’t fall asleep until really late, but there has to be some sort of solution. 

Am I the asshole?

I am reading the books with my sister (she got all the books too), and we meet up once a month to discuss notes, plots, what we think etc. It’s become a lovely sister-book-club tradition.  
  
Men and my sister are not the fastest readers. I like to listen to music when I’m reading to properly set the mood. And sometimes it can take me while to get the right ambience, but I don’t mind. I enjoy very much to try an immerse myself as much as possible. My sister does the same, so it works perfectly for the both of us.

However, my roommate and best friend(32F), wanted to read these books as well and asked if she could borrow them *after* me. I said of course! We have shared books many times and are both big fantasy nerds. However, she is a much faster ready than me and caught up very quickly. My problem here is that she asked if she could borrow the next book in the series (one I have yet to read) and I was a little hesitant because these are new books and a part of me wanted to be the one to read it first. Break the binding (iykyk), open it up and such. But I also felt silly for thinking like that. It’s just a book after all and she’s my best friend, so despite my hesitance I gave her the book.  
  
However, I can’t help but feeling a little bugged seeing her break the binding, reading while eating and in general just enjoying my newly gifted book. And I feel that I’m not okay if this is going to be like that for the rest of the books. That she reads them before me, and I get the hand-me-downs when it’s my new books and a gift from my boyfriend. A part of me wants to read them in my own pace and enjoy the new books myself and not share them before I have had my go at them first (I do not mind sharing them after at all!).

But I love both of them equally. 

My brother has a girlfriend Anna (22) who he has been dating for almost 2 years. Me and Anna get along super well, we like the same things and she is always very nice to me and hanging out with me. She brings me out for meals and shopping and is just really really nice. And she says she considers me her little sister because she’s always wanted one.

So I was excited because though I have a kate as my sister I only see kate like once every six months so we never got to do any sister stuff together. In comparison I see anna like at least twice a week and she’s always around.

Kate is back home for a while and we have all been having fun bonding together. However one time when Anna and I were just talking I made a passing comment like “youre such an annoying sister” to anna like as a joke. And that’s when I realised that kate looked really annoyed. 

After Anna went home kate scolded me and said that I shouldn’t toss around family terms so lightly. This sparked a huge fight 1) because George said that I should be allowed to call whoever I want sister and 2) he was angry that she didn’t consider anna apart of our family. I also got mad and kate called me insensitive and said that I should have a long think over of who’s my sister and who’s not. So am I the asshole?

151,1dy3w8n,AITA I avoid my friend because of her boyfriend.,"
Hi,
 I am 18F in medical university and i'm an international student. I'm a first year and have a friend who is also 18F and an international student. Because we are both international and there are so few of us we became friends and rely on each other for help. 

Now this friend of mine is so sweet and she's a big help to me. For example I had to go to the hospital for an emergency at night and she was the one who came to accompany me. She's always telling me that I can rely on her, giving me food and all that. She's basically my family away from home especially on holidays. 

I really do like her but i keep my distance because of her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is also an international student and they started dating 13 days after meeting each other. Honestly before I even knew his name I took one look at him and didn't like him. He gave me the creeps and i still dislike him even after talking with him for group projects and all that. He gives punk vibes and honestly i don't think this relationship is going to last for long. I don't even think she knows why she's dating him. She complains about him and honestly i think she's dating him because she's lonely and craving for love, affection and attention. Because from what she told me she only has her older brother to rely on. But i feel bad because sometimes i cancel plans with her because she tells me she's bringing her boyfriend along. And I think she's kind of got the hint that people in the class are avoiding her because of her boyfriend. 

Before at the start of the year everyone was new and getting to know each other so her boyfriend had a lot of people surrounding him but now he's basically a loner. And during lunch my friend and her boyfriend hang out alone. 

when they started dating it was the talk of the town. Even the lecturers came to know and asked her about it. No one likes her boyfriend, he's really annoying and people talk about them behind their back and avoid them. He makes things very awkward. For example we were taking a group photo for an event and obviously we class clown who was making some funny noises and no one minded, but it was my friend who was taking the photo so her boyfriend got mad and just shouted for hime to stop bothering his girlfriend. The whole class got silent and awkward  and even she looked embarrassed. Like it wasn't a big deal for him to yell at everyone. 

Another reason i avoid is because people judge you for who you hang out with and I don't want people to have a bad judgement of me because of her boyfriend.  I feel really bad but is it justified? AITA?

She complains about him and honestly i think she's dating him because she's lonely and craving for love, affection and attention. Because from what she told me she only has her older brother to rely on. But i feel bad because sometimes i cancel plans with her because she tells me she's bringing her boyfriend along. And I think she's kind of got the hint that people in the class are avoiding her because of her boyfriend. 

Before at the start of the year everyone was new and getting to know each other so her boyfriend had a lot of people surrounding him but now he's basically a loner. And during lunch my friend and her boyfriend hang out alone. 

when they started dating it was the talk of the town. Even the lecturers came to know and asked her about it. No one likes her boyfriend, he's really annoying and people talk about them behind their back and avoid them. He makes things very awkward. For example we were taking a group photo for an event and obviously we class clown who was making some funny noises and no one minded, but it was my friend who was taking the photo so her boyfriend got mad and just shouted for hime to stop bothering his girlfriend. The whole class got silent and awkward  and even she looked embarrassed. Like it wasn't a big deal for him to yell at everyone. 

Another reason i avoid is because people judge you for who you hang out with and I don't want people to have a bad judgement of me because of her boyfriend.  I feel really bad but is it justified? AITA?

152,1dy3qyl,AITA for refusing to let my younger half sister have the something borrowed that she asked for?,"My younger half sister Leah (19f) is getting married. Our dad and her mom are paying for the wedding and this will come in a bit later. I (27f) was asked by Leah if she could borrow a necklace I wore on my wedding day, that was my mom's before me, which she wore to her wedding to my dad. This was a sore topic. Even though my mom had wanted all of her jewelry to go to me, dad had given Leah a few things when she was a child. He told me I had no say in the matter and he loved my mom and wanted both his daughters to have pieces of her even though Leah is not my mom's child. I still dislike that she has some of *my mom's* jewelry. But I know dad has built her up to see it as something sweet.

So when she asked me to borrow the necklace I wore on my wedding day and mom wore on hers, it stung again. I told her she could not borrow that but I offered to let her borrow some of my jewelry. Stuff that isn't connected to my mom. Leah told me that wasn't fair and she wanted to get married matching me on my wedding day in some way. She asked if I'd feel differently if dad and her mom weren't paying for it. She told me she knows I don't like her parents and she doesn't think I should take it out on her. I said no, it's not that, it's that I don't want to share my mom's jewelry with her. That I never wanted her to have some of my mom's stuff. That was all dad. And I wasn't giving her another piece even just for one day. She accused me of gatekeeping my mom. She told me she had just as much right to it as I did. I asked her why when she has her own mom. She told me because everyone knows dad only ever loved my mom and her mom is less than second best. And clearly sharing something from my mom means he loves her (Leah) as an actual daughter despite him not loving her mom. That she wants to feel like I love her as a true sister and not some half thing that I wish didn't exist. She told me letting her borrow the necklace can show that. I still said no.

For back story I have a big fear of bugs everybody in my family knows that. Even ants freak me out. But everytime something happens with a bug they always pull the “it’s just a bug” line, like I don’t know that. Im also a night owl and am always roaming the house at night.
Tonight after everybody went to their beds around 12:30 AM I went back downstairs to bring a cup to the sink and felt that I was stepping on something. I thought it was just some food on the ground and then I thought I should pick that up after looking closer I realized it was a pile of maggots, then realized there were maggots all over the floor. I have mental health issues and at first I thought I was hallucinating.( have never hallucinated but have vivid dissociations) I thought I finally lost my last ever loving mind. I was in disbelief and started to hyperventilate and cry. Then ran upstairs to get bleach and bug spray not paying attention to how hard I was running. My aunt lives in the basement and you can hear every step down there.. I eventually call my mom who lives next-door and ask her what to do and if she has any just plain bleach and my little brother comes over with the bleach is just as shook as I am( not crying and hyperventilating, just shook) .

154,1dy3efv,AITA for not letting my addict brother stay with us after rehab? ,"My brother has been an addict for over a decade. We have never had the closest relationship but keep in touch often. He has a small child and a wife who travels for work. 

Over the last ten years, he has moved from state to state collecting DUIs, spending a couple nights in jail, and losing his job time and time again. The situation has escalated in the last few years to involving child protective services as he uses while home with his child. 

Extreme measures have been taken by other family members in the past to help him stay sober that have not been successful. 

He and his family recently moved to our town from out of state (their decision to move close to us was not a discussion but a “surprise”). Within a few months of their move, the police and child protective services have needed to get involved.

My husband and I have had to intervene on a few occasions so far including housing his child, picking him up when police have found him using, and physically trying to stop him from using which resulted in an altercation. He eventually had to be removed from his home due to potential child endangerment. 

He will now be completing a 60-day rehab program. Child protective services says he is not allowed to return home once he completes his rehab stay since he’s not allowed to live with his child yet. There’s currently no set timeline on this restriction. 

He has asked to stay at my house when he leaves rehab. I live with my husband and 10 month old baby. When he asked me, he said that his sobriety depends on being able to stay with us so that he’s not alone and can hopefully see his child. 

His other options are to stay with family that lives out of state so he would not be able to see his child, find a sober living program nearby, or stay at a hotel (likely short term only due to cost) or homeless shelter.

Another option that has been thrown around is for my husband and I to take in my brother's child so then my brother can live at home. 

I have concerns that he could relapse while staying with me. If the state doesn’t think it’s safe for him to live with his own child, then I don’t think it’s safe for him to stay with my child. I'm also not in a place that I would feel comfortable taking care of his child if it came down to it.

155,1dy3coc,AITA for refusing to throw my neglectful sister a birthday party?,"I (21F) am the youngest of three sisters. The eldest is Sara (30) and the middle one is Mellisa (24F). Growing up, I've always gotten along better with Sara due to our similar interests, and because she is a reliable and responsible person. Mellisa, on the other hand, has no sense of responsibility or accountability.

Mellisa never helps with chores or household duties. For instance, we share a cat, and while Sara buys the supplies, Mellisa and I take turns cleaning the litter box. However, Mellisa frequently neglects her duty, leaving the litter box dirty for over 24 hours, forcing me to clean it. This pattern extends to other chores as well - Mellisa once didn't clean her room for four months. As a result, I end up doing the majority of the housework, sometimes spending up to six hours a day cleaning, especially when guests are coming over.

Two months ago, Mellisa and I threw a birthday party for our sister Sara, and I bought Sara an expensive gift. Mellisa often jokes that I'm just a ""beggar"" and ""leech"" who is closer to Sara because she buys me things and drives me places. The truth is, I'm just grateful to have a responsible sister like Sara.

Now, Mellisa's birthday is approaching, and Sara wants us to throw her a party and buy her gifts. I told Sara I'm not participating. She said I should be ashamed of myself and that I'm not being a ""real sister."" My family seems to think my anger is just a sibling quarrel that will blow over, but I don't want to speak to Mellisa until she changes her irresponsible ways.

I understand this might make Mellisa feel I'm being sycophantic, and that I could be the asshole for refusing to celebrate her birthday, even though her behavior has been frustrating me. Maybe I should set aside my resentment for one day and try to repair our relationship. But I also don't see why I should celebrate someone who only brings me anger and frustration by dumping their responsibilities on me. At the same time, I know birthdays can be important, and refusing to celebrate hers could really hurt her feelings and damage our relationship further. I'm just not sure if I'm overreacting or if my feelings are justified.

Ultimately, I'm torn. I want to support my sister, but I'm tired of carrying the burden of her irresponsibility. I know birthdays are important, but I also don't want to reward her bad behavior.

Then he suddenly forgave me, considering what he said to me when we werent talking it seemed weird to me, and when we got back to being friends i noticed he was acting weird and he was to me acting like a creep on the internet, ik hes not in love with me and that we're js friends, but he said ""i love you"" and my overthinking thought he was a creep, i asked if he was and he got auper mad at me (one thing abt me is i overthink everything, literally everything) i apologised saying it was my overthinking and that i dont think he was a creep.

But something happened last month and its really done numbers on my mental health. So this guy was talking to 2 girls, he never said he was dating them but he never said he wasnt dating those girls. Another thing abt me is because of my mental issues i think ill never ever find a bf/gf and this one of my biggest insecurities. I told this guy to stop talking abt these girls in my dms as its making me feel insecure and he never addressed, not a sorry nothing. To get this off my chest i told one of my friends abt how i felt, i thought he was dating those 2 girls at the same time because he was talking like he was calling them hot and cute, 10 minutes later i get bombarded this him in my dms calling mw a liar and a peice of trash and that my mental health gets worse and worse.

The whole thing was stressful for me so i dont remember what i said. I dont think i said anything. Everyone was trying to defend him by saying ""he never said he was dating those girls why were u lying"" and id js shut down. He also went on to say how much of a bad friend i was saying i didnt appreciate him when i considered him like my older brother but not anymore. Many people said i have to apologise to him but i dont want to.

I wouldve apologised if he didnt call me those awful things instead of correcting me politely. My mental health has gotten so much worse since this whole situation. This isnt the first time hes called me awful things but ppl js forget them saying ""he had a right to call u those things because u treated him horribly when i didnt.

TL;DR: i thought my 17yo friend was dating 2 girls, and instead of him correcting me nicely he calls me worthless and everyones expecting me to apologise to him.

What do u guys think?",TL;DR,2024-07-08,"AITA for not apologising to ""friend"" Me F(15) and him M(17) have been ""friends"" for monthes, we talked alot when i was moving houses and he was nice, i talked abt my mental problems and hed always say sumthing nice to make me feel better, (if it means anything he came to me abt being friends) we got into alotta arguements tho and we didnt talk to eachother for 2 weeks, at the time i didnt tell him my age for obv reasons and sumone told him i was 15.

Then he suddenly forgave me, considering what he said to me when we werent talking it seemed weird to me, and when we got back to being friends i noticed he was acting weird and he was to me acting like a creep on the internet, ik hes not in love with me and that we're js friends, but he said ""i love you"" and my overthinking thought he was a creep, i asked if he was and he got auper mad at me (one thing abt me is i overthink everything, literally everything) i apologised saying it was my overthinking and that i dont think he was a creep.

But something happened last month and its really done numbers on my mental health. So this guy was talking to 2 girls, he never said he was dating them but he never said he wasnt dating those girls. Another thing abt me is because of my mental issues i think ill never ever find a bf/gf and this one of my biggest insecurities. I told this guy to stop talking abt these girls in my dms as its making me feel insecure and he never addressed, not a sorry nothing. To get this off my chest i told one of my friends abt how i felt, i thought he was dating those 2 girls at the same time because he was talking like he was calling them hot and cute, 10 minutes later i get bombarded this him in my dms calling mw a liar and a peice of trash and that my mental health gets worse and worse.

The whole thing was stressful for me so i dont remember what i said. I dont think i said anything. Everyone was trying to defend him by saying ""he never said he was dating those girls why were u lying"" and id js shut down. He also went on to say how much of a bad friend i was saying i didnt appreciate him when i considered him like my older brother but not anymore.

161,1dy2vw7,AITA for trying to make my girlfriend loose weight.,"Hey, i'm 23M and my gf is 25F. We've been dating for 2 years now and since we've been dating we BOTH gained weight. I love her and i don't think it makes her look less attractive at all. 

For the past few months my gf noticed that she gained weight and that her summer clothes didn't fit anymore started complaining about it. 
 
So now every time that she asks for take out i try to lie to her and tell her that im short on money or to give a similar excuse i hate lying to her but im just trying to help. 

I try going on a run with her but she ended up walking the whole time after i tried helping her by giving her advice on a good run posture. She ended up being sassy and moody for the rest of the day. I asked her what was happening and her reply was ""you take me for a child and you think im fat""
I keep trying to make healthy food by less ""snacks"" 

the thing is i want to loose weight too but i feel like if i go the gym on my own and start making progress it'll just end up making her feel worst. I do not know how to tell her its for us and our health without making it look like im telling her she took some weight, i did end up kinda being rude earlier today and told her to stop complaining if she ain't willing to work on it that yes we both took some weight but if you want to complain at least work on it and it did not do any good am i the asshole here i do not know what to think anymore...

162,1dy2fdm,AITA for accusing our friend of doing something to our bff?,"I'm not sure if I'm being overly paranoid here. My bff, August, and I have been friends for 10+ years. I love him and am very protective over him.

We go to the same college with a group of friends. Ethan and his gf are two of August's closest friends in this group. We're all really close, though. Talk daily and are friends for life.

It was a great year. It's our last year of college, so things were looking amazing. We went out partying, which isn't unusual for us.

August was really drunk and said he'd crash at Ethan and his gf's house. He had done this a million times before. But after that he ghosted us for 2 months. We reached out multiple times, but he said never responded. Ethan and his gf said he snuck out the next morning after the party and they never talked to him.

It was really strange. A couple of days after the party he deletes his instagram, facebook, etc.

I talk to his parents & sister and they have no idea what his deal is. Nothing happened in their family/no emergencies.


August ended up reaching out. He said he was sorry about ghosting and that he can't explain, he's just been dealing with a lot.

I forgave him (as did our friends) and we're doing our best to help him but he keeps pushing us away. The most crazy part of all of it is he refuses to hangout with us as a group and it looks to me like he refuses to be around Ethan and his gf.

He is also just so different. Reserved, hard to talk to, etc. What really stuck out to me is the last time we hangout alone I was going to order us drinks but he said he doesn't drink anymore.... We've been drinking for fun since we were 15.

I finally plead with August to tell me what's wrong but he said it was nothing for me to worry about, but something happened, but he doesn't want to talk about it, but to please not bring it up to our friends.

I didn't want to bring it up to them but I am so suspicious of Ethan/his gf. I feel like something happened, but I have no idea what.

We were hanging with the entire group except August. They were talking about how sad they are for him & how confused.

Ethan said he was too. I kind of called him out and asked if he was really sad/confused and he said he was. I told him to tell us what really happened, if he got into a fight with August that night.

It turned into a full argument. He said, at first, that no fight happened and they never spoke. Then he did a 180 and said a fight happened but he doesn't remember it because he was drunk and it wasn't a big deal anyway.

I have to admit this made me pissed. I yelled at him that our friend spent the night at HIS house and now refuses to see us together/drink/deletes his socials and it's not a big fucking deal? I said he was clearly hiding something.

He and his gf swore he wasn't, but I don't know. My friends said Ethan would never hurt August. They're best friends.

163,1dy2cye,AITA for purposely leaving a huge mess before I went on vacation?,"Throwaway account because my (27m) girlfriend (24f) follows my main. 

For some context, my girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years and living together for 3 of them. During covid, not long after moving in together, my girlfriend was laid off from her job. She claims EI, so her income is on the lower side. I make 6 figures and am well established in my career. I pay for the groceries and pay for the mortgage (the house is under my name). She covers utilities as she is at home most of the time and can’t afford to pay for much else. 

Right after she lost her job she applied to different places, but no one was hiring and then after 6 months she stopped applying. I love her and I don’t mind being the main provider, although it does bother me that I haven’t seen her even trying to apply for jobs. I have brought this up and she gets frustrated/angry and the conversation doesn’t last long, so I’ve stopped bring it up. 

We have had an unspoken agreement, she cooks and cleans because she is home all day and other than utilities doesn’t contribute anything else to the household. This brings me to the main issue: in the last few months she has stopped cleaning. She has simultaneously started playing a virtual cleaning game, which infuriates me. Last week I came home to her still in her clothes from the night before and laying in bed playing this game. I don’t think she had even left the bedroom. Our laundry is overflowing, there is a sink full of dishes, and the floors look disgusting. I lost it, I was supposed to be leaving for a 5 day work trip the next morning and had no clean clothes to pack. 

I screamed at her for being lazy. This where I may be the asshole, out of spite and partial pettiness I dumped two of our houseplants out, I dumped out two of the trash cans and the bottles, and finally tore apart the laundry basket to find my work clothes. I was seeing red and I told her if she wants to play that ridiculous game instead of doing actual housework then I’ll continue to make the house as disgusting as the virtual rooms she cleans. 

I took the clothes I thought I may need and went to stay at a friends house for the night and left for the trip in the morning. I came home yesterday, to the house clean EXCEPT for the mess I had made that night. She packed a few of her things and has decided to stay at her parents house for the moment until “I realize what an a hole I am.” I’m not sure I even want to apologize or if I feel sorry.

We planned to have dinner together, and I sent them a link to the restaurant and the menu they might like, which included the prices. They agreed and were enthusiastic to attend. My mom later warned me that they don’t earn much and suggested I change the venue, but it was too late as the reservation was already made and fee would be incurred if I cancelled. 

We had a great evening, and the restaurant was brilliant. When the bill came, I noticed they looked worried. I suggested we split the bill three ways, even though they had ordered more food, which should have made my portion cheaper. They agreed. I paid my third, but when it came time for them to pay their two-thirds, they had an issue with their card. I’m not sure if it declined, but supposedly it wouldn’t go through. We stood there for about five minutes before I finally said I’d put it all on my card. The total came to $377.67, which is quite expensive. 

Although I earn well, I feel that paying $377.67 for a night out is extensive. My mom is now saying I shouldn’t ask for the money back, given their financial situation. However, I feel that since they knew the restaurant and saw the menu prices, they could have suggested a different place if they couldn’t comfortably afford it. They also ordered mains, deserts and alcoholic drinks which took the bill higher than what it could have been.

We both exited the military last year and decided to move back to his home state so he could work on his familial relationships and I agreed I because liked the climate.
I got out of the military first and my options were limited to about three towns. I got a job in a town about an hour away from my husband's family. I moved solo with our toddler to live with his family for six weeks while he was working on getting out of the military. Being that I was living with my in-laws, I was commuting an hour daily for work and needed to find a place for us all to live when my husband joined us. He refused to consider any option aside from his hometown, so we moved into a place there. Our toddler was in daycare while I was solo parenting and when my husband came, we agreed to continue bringing him to daycare so we wouldn't have to worry about a waitlist when he started working. Note: we had a camera in the living room so on the days he didn't take the toddler to daycare, I saw them watching whatever show my husband wanted to watch.
Fast forward to the end of the same year, my husband tells me he never applied to any job (October/November) and in December, I had our second child days before Christmas. 

We decided to continue day care with the toddler because I was not receiving any pay postpartum and needed to telework starting at 4weeks postpartum. At 8 weeks postpartum, I returned to work in person and at 11 weeks, we started the process to buy a home. We continued to keep the toddler in daycare until we closed so he only had to worry about one kid during the moving process.

Now we are at the present, my husband is the stay at home parent to both children and I am the full time working parent. We have been constantly arguing and I called him a shitty stay at home parent. My husband watches the kids and not much else. The laundry is almost never done and when it is, it stays in the basket all week. Dishes pile in the sink, but apparently they are all mine. I would totally give him some slack if he was doing stuff with the kids, but he doesn't go anywhere with them and he has full capability. When the weekend comes around, I feel like have to do all the stuff he doesn't, which is buying the groceries, reset the house, and do all the things he doesn't.
I also feed our baby. I breastfeed at home when I get off work and through the night and pump at work. I'm also the only one introducing baby food and bathing our kids.

169,1dy1r6r,WIBTA if I told my brother he's autistic? ,"So, I'm not autistic, but both of my brothers are. They have relatively low support needs, but have been diagnosed since we were all in elementary school. The catch is though, my parents didn't tell them. My older brother only knows because he got a girlfriend and my parents wanted him to be aware in case they decided to have kids one day. According to him, it completely changed his life and put a lot of things into perspective, including the bullying he went through in highschool. 
Our younger brother is 19 now and my parents still haven't told him, and don't plan to. He has zero interest in dating so they're probably not going to have that motivation any time soon.

My older brother and I both think he has the right to know. He's low support needs but his autism still informs his behavior, and he's not very open about his issues anyway so there could be stuff going on we don't know about. My older brother is really passionate about it because of how much he struggled due to a condition he had no idea he had. And I empathise with him a lot, I only got diagnosed with ADHD after I turned 18, and if I had gotten the chance to get support earlier a lot of things would've been easier.

It also just feels really wrong talking behind his back like this. I've brought it up to my parents before and their explanation is that they don't want him to think he's ""different"" from other people, but I'd imagine he'd feel that way regardless. Also, my dad is convinced that his autism is basically cured and ""not a problem anymore"". I tried to tell him that's not how it works and he shut me down immediately. 

Part of me can understand the reasoning that if my brother doesn't ask, it's not really my place to drop a bomb like that on him, but it still feels wrong lying. On the other hand, my brother is pretty smart, so he might have already figured it out. I just worry about him starting college in the dark when this information could potentially help him a lot.

170,1dy1olw,AITA-Mother of the year?,"This ongoing conflict involves my girlfriend’s mom (50) and her stepsister (33). I'm sharing this to understand who's in the right and who's in the wrong.

Back in 2022, the stepsister's 13-year-old daughter was complaining of stomach pains for three days. The stepsister's boyfriend claimed the girl was faking it, and the mom ignored the girl's complaints. When my girlfriend’s mom saw how pale and sick the girl looked, she took her to the hospital, where they discovered her appendix had burst. The doctors said that if she hadn't been treated, the situation could have become life-threatening.

A few days later, while the girl was recovering in the hospital, the stepsister's boyfriend threatened to harm the stepsister if she didn’t come home to watch their 3-year-old or bring him to the hospital. Then, in April 2022, the stepsister’s boyfriend hit the 13-year-old for accidentally spilling coffee. My girlfriend’s mom intervened and confronted the stepsister, who played the victim and blamed the 13-year-old for causing family issues. The mom told her that she was the one ruining the family, not the girl.

Fast forward to 2023, the mom and stepsister have had continuous arguments, primarily about the 13-year-old, who is now 14. The stepsister claims she's doing a great job raising her daughter, while the mom disagrees and criticizes her parenting. In one heated exchange, the mom threw a garbage bag at the stepsister, telling her to go live with her “family of garbage.” The mom got physically sick from the stress of that fight, while the stepsister played the victim again.

This year, the stepsister told the family that her 14-year-old daughter should cook and do her own laundry, but she doesn't provide any money for the girl to do so. The mom has posted several times on Facebook criticizing the stepsister’s parenting instead of addressing it directly. Most recently, at a fair where everyone was drunk, the mom posted that the stepsister can take care of her young children and abusive boyfriend but can’t be bothered to do anything for her daughter.

We’ve been friends for 4-5 years and I’ve seen him go through tons of relationships and either met or become friends with his significant others. Nothing romantic, suggestive or anything in that area has happened between and I always wanted it to stay tha way, he’s 3 years older than me so mutual. But his recent girlfriend has been the worse in my opinion, he goes through relationship quickly so I didn’t figure she would last long since he always tell me about their constant problems. At first I wanted to met her and get to know her but it was never arranged but he talked about us to one another, I was eager to meet her but on her end she though I was trying to “steal him away”. He sent a SS of our conversation of me saying something and didn’t show me said SS but he said it wasn’t anything out of context and after he showed the SS to her, she first assumed as a man and than when figured out I was girl starting saying he shouldn’t hang around me at ALL. As a girl, I totally understand wanting a female best friend to at least back away a bit and I did just that but I didn’t except to lose complete contact. He didn’t follow through with it and simply calmed her down and ever since than all I’ve heard from him were all their arguments, breaks, issues and hardships. She’s all he talks TO ME about and not even in a good light, I’ve recently grown annoyed of him only talking me just to vent about her and as a friend I wish to be supportive but as a person with thin patient it got to me. I wanted to keep his relationship with her separate from our friendship by now cause I was being a therapist and all the while I was trying to make an idea of his girlfriend in my mind, she would just talk shit about me to him all the time, obsessing over him putting me in his bio one time, matching pfp or anything of the sort. So I stopped doing it in respect of her but she didn’t stop the shit talk so I figured she just a toxic bitch (never said it to her face).

172,1dy1hyb,AITA co-parenting screen time conflict,"Daughter (12) spends lots of time on tech, I co-parent with her mum 50:50, week on week off. Daughter is in first year of a top 10 UK grammar school which is demanding and has lots of homework. The weeks she’s with me, just gets all her homework done as I help encourage her to do it. She’s fine once she gets started but tech addiction is a ‘barrier to entry’ - when she’s with mom she never gets it done and comes back to me with excess homework and always playing catchup - this Is despite me and her mom having agreement that all homework is cleared before handover day.

I setup screen time limits which are generous: 2 hours a day weekdays and 6 hours at weekends, I think this is loads. Also have app limits for example only 1 hour max for TikTok because is frankly just horrendous for kids brains. I encourage time in nature, we’ll go hiking or do some active leisure which she enjoys once started, but again would default to lounging all day given a choice

Screen Time limits setup on my iOS account as I bought the phone and setup the contract etc. 

Mom is complaining that I should either remove limits or give her access to boost screen time when daughter is with her (not sure even possible).

My issue is that mom will just let daughter rot her brain 24/7 all weekends and week nights and develop chronic phone addiction - not an assumption, it’s happened many times before. And because daughter is in such a great school I’m really keen to not let that happen as she likely fall behind studies and become overwhelmed. 

I feel like I’m working alone to instil self discipline, motivation and healthy lifestyle balance.

I currently live at home with my parents. My mom works at a family business where she has made me work for the last 6 years. My sister worked there before me doing piece work, but got a different job, and moved out. My mom made me takeover her old job.

My mom constantly dragges me to work and I do it all for a lousy pay check that sometimes doesn't even come. For an idea of how bad my pay check is I only get 50 cent for each trap I build. And what I build takes up to 3 minutes per trap. With rising inflation in America this is pretty much nothing, and while building it my entire arm gets scraped and cut badly, which leads to awkward conversations with people.

After I'm done at work my mom makes me come home and makes me clean up the entire kitchen which is always a disaster, because I live with 6 people two of which are young children, and on weekends side rooms and sometimes my siblings rooms along with the kitchen. After I clean up the kitchen my mom guilt trips me into cooking and this is all after going to school all day. 

She always tells me that I'm lazy and going to school isn't anything compared to her work, but my school is mentally draining because of a girl that has made my life a living hell since 9th grade I have talked to my mom about her(This girl threatenes hurt herself if I don't talk to her. I talked to my guidance counselor and she told me to just be fake friends.). She always says that I never do anything and that I should more, but I'm already swamped and drained.

Anytime I say anything she says I'm selfish and that my room is worth a lot of money these days and she could rent it out to people. She acts like I'm a selfish brat, but honestly I don't feel like I'm asking a lot. 

I just want my siblings to start helping out because they make a majority of all the messes and help with absolutely nothing. I have asked my mom to get them to help a little more. My sister is 11 and leaves art all over the house and my mom gets mad when I asked my sister to clean up after herself.

Every time I ask for a small break my mom tells me I'm lazy and sleep constantly(I don't I read books and she knows that). I don't get weekends off to hangout with my friends and when I want to hangout with them my mom gets suddenly obsessed with my life and asks me to jump through loops to hangout with them.

My mom constantly dragges me to work and I do it all for a lousy pay check that sometimes doesn't even come. For an idea of how bad my pay check is I only get 50 cent for each trap I build. And what I build takes up to 3 minutes per trap. With rising inflation in America this is pretty much nothing, and while building it my entire arm gets scraped and cut badly, which leads to awkward conversations with people.

After I'm done at work my mom makes me come home and makes me clean up the entire kitchen which is always a disaster, because I live with 6 people two of which are young children, and on weekends side rooms and sometimes my siblings rooms along with the kitchen. After I clean up the kitchen my mom guilt trips me into cooking and this is all after going to school all day. 

She always tells me that I'm lazy and going to school isn't anything compared to her work, but my school is mentally draining because of a girl that has made my life a living hell since 9th grade I have talked to my mom about her(This girl threatenes hurt herself if I don't talk to her. I talked to my guidance counselor and she told me to just be fake friends.). She always says that I never do anything and that I should more, but I'm already swamped and drained.

Anytime I say anything she says I'm selfish and that my room is worth a lot of money these days and she could rent it out to people. She acts like I'm a selfish brat, but honestly I don't feel like I'm asking a lot. 

I just want my siblings to start helping out because they make a majority of all the messes and help with absolutely nothing. I have asked my mom to get them to help a little more. My sister is 11 and leaves art all over the house and my mom gets mad when I asked my sister to clean up after herself.

Every time I ask for a small break my mom tells me I'm lazy and sleep constantly(I don't I read books and she knows that). I don't get weekends off to hangout with my friends and when I want to hangout with them my mom gets suddenly obsessed with my life and asks me to jump through loops to hangout with them.

177,1dy0wl2,AITA for spending the night alone with a friend during a vacation with my GF?,"I (22m) have been dating my Caitlin (22f) for the last 3 years. We are college students and in the same friend group. For reasons out of our control, it is very possible that we go LDR or even break up after graduation this school year.

A recurring argument between Caitlin and I is that I have not prioritized her over my friends. Caitlin has also specifically pointed out at times what she feels is me choosing to hang out with my friends and neglecting her.

Recently, our friend group planned a 4-day vacation. For Caitlin and I, this vacation was the only time we could see each other for the summer. I found out that Stephen, one of my home friends, would also be vacationing at the same place and time. This vacation was also the only time I could see Stephen for at least the next 6-12 months. Caitlin knew this and that I planned to spend time with him on the vacation.

During the vacation, Stephen and I were unable to find time that did not conflict with each other. I wanted to spend the day/evenings with my girlfriend and rejected most of Stephen's daytime proposals. We eventually settled on clubbing because we were only both free during nights. Originally, I was going to stay at Stephen's place after clubbing, but, after some of my friends decided to join us, I went back with them to our hotel after clubbing. Caitlin didn't come (she's under 21).

On the last night of the trip, Caitlin and I had an argument about me not spending enough alone time with her and not showing that I was excited to see her. While she made some valid arguments, one major point was that I had planned to go clubbing with Stephen even if my friends weren't coming and I had to stay the night at Stephen's hotel. Caitlin felt that my original intention to stay with Stephen for a night was disrespectful since I would be hungover the next morning and not see her until afternoon. In her words, since we may be broken up or long-distance after this school year, she should take precedence no matter what, and if going clubbing meant I had to stay over with Stephen for a night, then I should have just not gone. Since, Caitlin and I would not be able to spend consistent time with each other after graduation, hanging out with Stephen that night with the intention of sleeping over was choosing him over her.

I tried to explain that I would not have seen him for at least the next 1/2 year if I did not go clubbing that night. I also stated that I had specifically not done anything with him during the day with him so I could spend time with Caitlin, and that the friend group usually did not leave the hotel until the afternoon anyways. Finally, even though our relationship was uncertain after college, we would still be able to spend the entire school year before graduation together. Thus, me sleeping over at Stephen's was not significantly cutting into our time. However, she still believes I am in the wrong.

this is not even start of it, I got piercings and a month later she got em too, I got another peircing and she got another one just a week later, then I had my third piercing and she was like, omg u didn't tell me you got another piercing , and she went up and got another one this time and didn't tell me she got em, it was almost like she was competing in an non existent competition with me!
And one day in a joke I said to her, about how I got peircings and she got piercings after being inspired by me, in a totalllll joke and laughter and she was all like, ""who would copy you, what's even there in you to copy? "" In a fully rude ass bitchy tone!! Like she literally just said that!? 
It annoyed me at most!! But I was okeyy she is my sister let it goooooo... 
I have a VERY DRAMATIC way of talking, with full flung hand gestures, making jokes, and faces when I talk about almost everything, and she was soo frustrated at not being able to copy me at that(because I saw her attempt to talk like me with hand gestures and facial expressions that only I make I my whole of the family), that she called me 'I have a very dramatic personality, that I was fake, and actually didn't talk like that at all!'In front of all family!

Like calling me out for my own personality! Why do you even care what I am like!! 
So we had a fight on this and I called her  a parrot who always mimicked! 
And she was in a full fledged rage and started bringing up evey flaw of mine. 

But actually the issue with me is not about if she is regarding me as an inspiration, or if she likes how I am and wants to be like me or whatever, but she is pushing me down to climb up, telling me how I have a shitty personality, how no one would copy me, while the irony is SHE is copying me! The problem she is copying my dreams and bragging and calling herself entitled to those dreams showing it all to our family how she did it all better and first than me, like cmon bro I'm 17 what even is there to compare!

179,1dy0ul6,AITA for getting snarky with my friends girlfriend after watching their dogs for the long weekend?,"Hi all. It’s a long one. I appreciate any insights. 

Long story short, my friend who has two large dogs (Great Pyrenees) decided that he was going to book a last minute flight out of state on Wednesday night. He asked me if i would watch the dogs and just stop by his place to feed them twice a day until Sunday night. Keep in mind he asked me at 6pm and left at 11pm. I know that he doesn’t have any other person to ask, and I know he doesn’t have the money to board them. So I agreed to do it for him. 

He was supposed to return tonight (Sunday) at 8pm. Earlier today, his girlfriend texted me and said that he got heatstroke and went to the hospital for an IV, so they were going to have to miss their flight because he was sleeping and recovering at a friends house. They rebooked to tomorrow. It’s worth mentioning that i do share locations with him, and his phone died, but 40 minutes after he was allegedly taken to the hospital, his location was showing at a bar. Nearest hospital was about a 5 minute drive. That’s beside the point, but makes me feel like they could be lying about the hospital visit. 

Anyways, she didn’t ask “hey this happened.. could you please take care of the dogs one more day?” She just told me the situation and said they’d be back tomorrow. While i was asking a follow up question “and y’all aren’t going to be making your 5:45 flight?” She replied with “no [my name].” Which i felt was pretty passive aggressive. My age of people know that a ‘.’ means F off. None of her previous texts had periods at the end. 

I replied with “first off, i don’t appreciate the attitude, [her name]. I’m doing yall a favor….” (There’s more, mostly about how i always help them out with stuff, and always seem to get screwed over because of it). Hours later she responded, And apparently that sent her off a cliff. She sent me a super long text with many disrespect comments about me. Things along the lines of “I’m sorry that i thought you being his ‘best friend’ would actually be beneficial” and “I’m sorry that all his reliable friends have moved out of state and you were our last resort”. 

And then he wakes up and sends me “hey buddy, just woke up, we’re gonna have a nice talk on Tuesday”. I’m 4 years older than him and I’m somewhat of an older brother figure in his life. I’ve bent over backwards helping him in any and every way possible. In fact, he currently owes me $850 because he borrowed it months ago to be able to make his mortgage payment. He has been paying me back very slowly and inconsistently. 

Last thing to add, but looking at his location recently, it looks like he was out getting a tattoo. 

Anyways, AITA for giving his girlfriend attitude given the situation?

Last year we made plans to travel to the Mediterranean in September 2023 and go diving, but my wife was having a stressful time at work with job interviews at the time, and asked for us to postpone it to this year so I could be around to support her.

I said that I would, but that since we were planning to try for a baby this year (2024), I would prefer if we waited after the trip to go off contraception so that (1) my wife could come on the trip and/or (2) I wouldn’t have to miss out AGAIN to stay home and support her.

My wife said that she didn’t want to come on the trip anyway, and that she wouldn’t mind if I went even if she was pregnant so long as I wouldn’t miss the birth.  I agreed to this, and me and my friends booked the trip for September 2024 and my wife went off contraception in May so that even if she did become pregnant, the due date wouldn’t be until after the trip.

Surprisingly, she fell pregnant quickly.  She has tested positive, and some calculations regarding likely date of conception show that she is ALREADY approximately 4 weeks pregnant, which means that she will be aproximately 3 months pregnant when we go on the trip.

She is now asking me to cancel so I can be home to support her.  However I think that’s unfair since I initially said we shouldn’t try for a baby until after the trip and it was her idea to start trying to conceive prior to the trip.

I told him if he wasn’t addicted he should stop now, because nicotine is so addictive and any temporary high he gets now will go away as his tolerance goes up. So he’ll have to use more and more, and the dips in between will become worse. My mom used to tell me the only time she felt normal was right after she smoked. And then she just felt worse and worse until she smoked again. I asked him why he would want to start something like that?! He said I was beginning to controlling and basically called me an asshole and said I was addicted to caffeine and why I don’t I quit that if I’m so worried? I told him I would no problem, I’ll quit caffeine tomorrow if he quits the pouches with me. He snapped at me and acted like it was controlling to suggest that if I’d only quit if he did too. I told him I don’t want to control him but I care about him. So… AITA? ",0.0,0.9788108468055725,1,0

Once I married my husband, my mother, 59F, started guilting me for moving out and taking my kids. She guilted my oldest so horribly that they will not even stay with me. My mother plays favorites and treats my youngest like crap. (She also treated me that way and favored my older brother.) 

Since the last day of school, both kids have been staying with my parents. They’ve been on two trips already, and will probably go on more.  I broke my ankle in late 2021 and haven’t been able to go on vacation with them since. (I also work with my mother.)

All of this is tearing me and my husband apart. I’ve never stood up for myself, and don’t know how to now. He says that I need to set firm boundaries and bring the kids home when they get back from their vacation. Would I be the AH for setting boundaries when there never has been any before?

185,1dy0ijx,AITA for being weird towards my friends?,"J, S, H are my friends 

Before school ended and summer started, I had been feeling uneasy about my friends and my relationship with them. I began to feel left out because they all had a closer relationship with each other and I just felt so out of the loop, thinking i’m missing out on something. Along with that, I started to feel jealous and i hated it because they were my friends, i love them and tried my best to stay loyal to them. 

After feeling like this I finally confronted one them, J, because I had noticed H and S unfollowed me from their spam accounts on insta. J finally sent a paragraph and i’m just going to list some of the stuff  it said: I talked crap about them and threw ‘subs’, I don’t listen to their advice and complain, mentioned posting saying i made new friends, I haven’t matured  

I apologized and understood, saying I shouldn’t have appreciated them enough and talked crap about them and explain why I was talking about them in the first place. But my thing is, I have never EVER talked about them unless they wronged me (which they have, and will talk about later). Also the friend stuff, I had just made amends with a friend group I lost 2 years ago and made other friends along with that — posting about it because I was very excited. They are right about me complaining and haven’t matured, and I recognize that I have a problem that I am trying to fix. After apologizing, they cut me off and it’s been almost a month since I have talk to them. 

I do recognize my mistakes, and my problems. I do recognize i have a problem controlling my feelings and such (That’s how I lost my other friend group.) But I can’t help but think that they have also wrong me too, and they’re acting all high and mighty. For example: During a hangout, H told me she wanted to steal some album from a store that was HEAVILY full of cameras. Knowing from experience, I told her to not do anything and she didn’t listen. She then left me behind in the store to deal with her stuff, desperately trying to convince the store manager to not call the police. Another example: When i had my sweet 16, I was trying to see if everyone is still able to come. S told me last minute that she wasn’t able to. But for the past 5 months of me checking up on everyone til the day of the party and her still saying yes, this change was so sudden and weird that all of sudden her parents say ‘no’. I understand stingy parents and sudden change, their excuse was that the venue was too far and I was ‘wild.’ Meanwhile, she went to other parties that were FARTHER AWAY and what do mean by ‘wild’???

I am better now, I started hanging out with my new friends that i had made. But I can’t help but think that if I am the asshole for feeling or thinking bad about my friends? I loved them, but I feel like i’m putting too much effort into them.I admire them so much, before all of this I have never talked about anything relating to them, especially bad about them. AITA?

191,1dxzx44,AITA for threatening to call the police after my older sister stole my dog?,"I (22, f) have wanted a German Shepherd since I was a little girl. My mother was very adopt-don’t-shop, which was amazing for her, not so nice for little me when I wanted such a specific breed. I’ve lived with high school sweetheart / longterm boyfriend for about three years now and a few months ago we came to the conclusion we were going to buy a GSD. We found a reputable breeder, and bought a little female puppy for a hell-of a price. I named her Constance, and she’s my pride and joy. 

Two weeks ago, me and my boyfriend needed to go out of town for three days so we could visit his dying grandmother. I asked my older sister (28) to visit the dog daily, for 15 bucks a day. All she would need to do is feed her, water her and take her outside (obviously we expected accidents but were going to try and stop it for the most part). 

When we returned, after having checked in with my sister daily and being under the guise we’d be seeing our puppy, we found that she was gone! Immediately, I called my sister and she immediately broke down and said she had taken the puppy. I asked her what her plan was, and she told me she was going to sell her (and that we were negligent owners)! My heart broke. I’ve never lost all my trust in someone.

Anyway, I drove to my mom’s house, as that’s who my older sister is staying with and got Constance back. I told my older sister I would call the police on her if she ever showed up at my house again, and I didn’t want contact with her.

I’m uncertain what she told my mother and father, and my younger teenage brother but both my parents think I’m a total asshole for threatening to call the police on her. I didn’t truly mean it, but I genuinely don’t think I will ever get over this. My younger brother is mostly indifferent, but thinks I overreacted. I dont even know what to say?! My boyfriend and friends are on my side but my family means a lot to me so I need unbiased opinions.

AITA?

Edit to update: I am not an animal abuser and the people in the comments are actually crazy. It was a mistake that I’ve already said wouldn’t happen again. I was ignorant and have already begun researching how to better care for her. But the utter delusions in the comments, such as random assumptions with zero evidence to back them up really prove that people aren’t that bright.

I’m not sure what you guys want from me as I’ve already said I’m going to fix that issue, but that’s never enough for Reddit, you should be fully aware many shelter dogs don’t get adopted. Why would I feed into that ongoing issue?

For those saying my sister is in the right, I’ve already come to the conclusion she isn’t and you guys just want to be mad at me. The fact of the matter is she didn’t care about Constance’s wellbeing, she’s got an ongoing gambling issue and wanted money. 

Animal abuse: *Animal Cruelty is defined as depriving an animal of food, water, shelter, and/or veterinary care. Torturing, maiming, or killing animals is also animal cruelty. There are many reasons people have used to be cruel to animals.*

Deprive: *deny (a person or place) the possession or use of something.*

My dog was fed, watered and had shelter. She also has a vet. It was a big mistake, yes, but not abuse. It was literally just me being ignorant.

All she would need to do is feed her, water her and take her outside (obviously we expected accidents but were going to try and stop it for the most part). 

When we returned, after having checked in with my sister daily and being under the guise we’d be seeing our puppy, we found that she was gone! Immediately, I called my sister and she immediately broke down and said she had taken the puppy. I asked her what her plan was, and she told me she was going to sell her (and that we were negligent owners)! My heart broke. I’ve never lost all my trust in someone.

Anyway, I drove to my mom’s house, as that’s who my older sister is staying with and got Constance back. I told my older sister I would call the police on her if she ever showed up at my house again, and I didn’t want contact with her.

I’m uncertain what she told my mother and father, and my younger teenage brother but both my parents think I’m a total asshole for threatening to call the police on her. I didn’t truly mean it, but I genuinely don’t think I will ever get over this. My younger brother is mostly indifferent, but thinks I overreacted. I dont even know what to say?! My boyfriend and friends are on my side but my family means a lot to me so I need unbiased opinions.

AITA?

Edit to update: I am not an animal abuser and the people in the comments are actually crazy. It was a mistake that I’ve already said wouldn’t happen again. I was ignorant and have already begun researching how to better care for her. But the utter delusions in the comments, such as random assumptions with zero evidence to back them up really prove that people aren’t that bright.

I’m not sure what you guys want from me as I’ve already said I’m going to fix that issue, but that’s never enough for Reddit, you should be fully aware many shelter dogs don’t get adopted. Why would I feed into that ongoing issue?

For those saying my sister is in the right, I’ve already come to the conclusion she isn’t and you guys just want to be mad at me. The fact of the matter is she didn’t care about Constance’s wellbeing, she’s got an ongoing gambling issue and wanted money. 

Animal abuse: *Animal Cruelty is defined as depriving an animal of food, water, shelter, and/or veterinary care. Torturing, maiming, or killing animals is also animal cruelty. There are many reasons people have used to be cruel to animals.*

Deprive: *deny (a person or place) the possession or use of something.*

My dog was fed, watered and had shelter. She also has a vet. It was a big mistake, yes, but not abuse. It was literally just me being ignorant. I never denied her any of that, I simply did not go about an emergency correctly and it won’t happen again.",1.0,0.9711512923240662,1,1

193,1dxzn71,AITA for trying to signal that my minister was taking too long?,"My wife and I have attended one of the churches in our town for nearly a decade. We really enjoy the thoughtful sermons, and virtually all of our friends are from this religious community, but in recent years, they have become much too lenient when it comes to time limits. 

The services are supposed to last only one hour, from 10 AM to 11 AM, and this expectation has been clearly communicated to the members for years, but frequently they go over by 5-10 minutes. I have real difficulty staying still for that long, and it always irks me that the minister seems oblivious to how long he rambles. There is also coffee and a snack tray after the service, and his inability to tell time means that the snacks are pretty much picked clean by the kids as they exit Sunday school, leaving almost no food for the adults. 

Today, I just couldn't take it anymore. We always end our services with announcements, and today was no exception, but we were in the middle of the final hymn and it was 11:10 AM! At this rate, the service would end nearly 15 minutes late, which I found totally unacceptable. I tried to get the minister's attention by making eye contact with him and tapping on my watch, as if to say that he was over the allotted time. I thought that he would get the hint and direct the members not to sing through the final verse of the hymn, but instead he made eye contact with me, looked a bit disgusted, and went ahead singing anyway.

Needless to say, I felt incredibly disrespected and was quite angry at him. At this rate, we would probably only have a few measly grapes and some crackers left because the kids would surely hog all of the good stuff, like chocolate chip cookies. I stopped singing, angrily put my hymnal down on the pew, and marched outside to get my food and coffee. My wife seemed surprised by what I had done, but she nonetheless followed me out of the sanctuary. When we got outside, though, she made it clear that I had overstepped. She said that I had ""shown up"" the minister and that my actions were ""infantile.""

I tried to reason with her. I said that this minister is an egomaniac that has no respect for others' time, or their stomachs for that matter. I asked her what her opposition was to following a schedule, and she actually said that she ""shared my concerns"" but that the way I went about it was ""all wrong."" I couldn't help but laugh. If she thinks a full plate and a strong cup of coffee is ""wrong,"" then she doesn't understand business. After all, we don't pay membership dues for nothing in return. When the other members came out, though, she sheepishly asked me for the car keys and waited in the car until I was done socializing. I think she needs to chill out, personally, but she clearly thinks I'm some sort of dumb oaf. I just wish she could understand my perspective sometimes.

My (36f) and husband (38m) have been together for almost four years. We have been friends for almost 24 years. We both went down extremely different paths, but remained friends, best friends we used to say. Thru out all of life we have seen each other make it thru some pretty crappy situations, relationships, struggles, but there was always something pulling us together.

Without going into the whole scheme of things, My husband, let’s call him J, was serving time in prison and asked me in the longest email to be his girlfriend.  I can’t tell you the feelings that made me feel, and the day he said “T I’m in love with you” He was the love of my life and we finally had our chance.  Now I’m planning this whole “the rest of our lives” and thinking he’s on the same page.  J is released from prison and pretty much it goes down hill. J starts using meth, with well whoever he uses with, but also his mom. Background J had been using meth with his mom since before 18. His mom has always enabled and encouraged J to use. I was livid, I went through the process of trying to “save” him, countless hours driving around looking for him, the whole 9 yards.  I was terrified J would over dose and die, by himself on a gravel road. Because of our past friendship, I believed every thing he had ever said to me. We went thru rehabs, relapses, and a year in jail and I stuck it out. J made me so many promises while in jail this last time. Some of the things he said were in response to boundaries I had set.  I was so excited.  I thought this time we are gonna make it. The first day he was out he said “he found God and forgave his mom”  Js mom has been an issue in our relationship because she’s an addict and he has been in recovery for 3 months, relapsed once and stopped himself a few weeks ago from relapsing again.  I’ve said some pretty harsh things to Js mom, she has tried to break us up, she has given him meth, lied for him, has called the police on me.

199,1dxyvl1,WIBTA for sharing my baseless suspicions with family?,"Not using a throwaway, so I'll try to be as vague as possible.

I (30sF) and my sibling (millennial aged) were raised by our mother. Our parents split up when we were very young, and our dad resided in another country. When we were kids, we wouldn't see our father often. He would send gifts and money,but we could easily go several years without seeing him in person. As a teen, he would send us allowance and money directly but we still didn't see him more than once a year or so.

Fast forward to the present day, and not much has changed. We try to do video calls à few times à month, but we rarely visit in person.

A few months ago, during one of our zoom calls, I noticed a new picture hanging on our dad's wall. He always had a framed photo of my sibling and myself, but I noticed a third photo hanging next to mine. The video quality wasn't amazing and I couldn't make out this person's features, but I could tell it was a female. I wondered if it was me, but the completion and face shape seemed different.

 After a few zoom calls of me trying to make out the face (with no luck), I asked my dad who the person was. He casually responded that it was a friend from ""country X"", and we moved on. I found it weird that he'd have a random friend's picture up, alongside his two kids, but no other family members or friends on the wall.

Now, for the last year or so, our dad has been talking about relocating. He frequently mentioned relocating to our city, and how nice it would be. 
Last week however, he randomly brought up the idea of relocating to ""Country X"", as a possibility. He seemed quite keen on the idea, despite it being overseas and incredibly far from family, friends and his doctors.

I don't know if I have to much time on my hands, and if I'm letting my imagination run wild, but it's crossed my mind a few times that this might be a daughter in ""Country X"".  He used to do a LOT of travelling internationally for work, so it wouldn't at all be out of the realm of possibility.

I've always found it a little weird that we never heard of him dating anybody new in the last 20 - 30 years. He always seemed a little hung up on my mom.

Anyway, I want answers, and was thinking of asking my mom if she knew anything about the ""Country X"" situation, and the possibility of him having another kid. I also wanted to bring the observations to my sibling's  attention.

WIBTA for bothering my mother, who wants as little as possible to so with our father? And WIBTA for mentioning my ""suspicions"" to my sibling who seems unbothered and oblivious? 

Am I JUMPING to conclusions, and making something out of nothing?  I'd like some opinions please. 

TLDR: I'd like to know if I'd be in the wrong for asking my mom and sibling  about the possibility of my dad having a ""secret"" daughter.",Asshole,2024-07-08,"WIBTA for sharing my baseless suspicions with family? Not using a throwaway, so I'll try to be as vague as possible.

I (30sF) and my sibling (millennial aged) were raised by our mother. Our parents split up when we were very young, and our dad resided in another country. When we were kids, we wouldn't see our father often. He would send gifts and money,but we could easily go several years without seeing him in person. As a teen, he would send us allowance and money directly but we still didn't see him more than once a year or so.

Fast forward to the present day, and not much has changed. We try to do video calls à few times à month, but we rarely visit in person.

A few months ago, during one of our zoom calls, I noticed a new picture hanging on our dad's wall. He always had a framed photo of my sibling and myself, but I noticed a third photo hanging next to mine.

201,1dxyolg,AITAH for not loving my husband’s pasta dinner,"Hi first time posting here but my husband and I have been fighting since the afternoon for the dinner decision tonight. It is such a minor issue but small conflicts happened a lot lately. We tried talking tonight but it is an impasse. Would love to hear all your opinions since I have been following this sub for years.

So after a takeout lunch I told my husband I would be making a stew for dinner- pork, cabbage, onion, tofu & mushroom. The pork and tofu are about to expire and rest are leftovers. We will be eating with rice and he’s happy with it.

Around 4:30pm, he happily informed me he made fresh pasta. I love his fresh pasta and have been begging for him to make some for a month.  It was a small batch he just made but I was caught in surprise since I thought we already made the dinner plan. My face definitely showed the surprise and he left. 

After 20min I started making the pasta sauce since I don’t want to discourage him and I figured the pork will probably still be okay tmr. Unfortunately my sauce turned out to be not that good (I only had diced tomatoes and just went with the first receipt I found online which called for crushed tomato… also it’s like the second time I tried making pasta sauce). Anyway we had some homemade pasta with homemade sauce and I couldn’t stand the sauce anymore so I asked him to open a store bought sauce. He made an annoyed face and I just lost it.

He said I don’t appreciate him and whatever he did was wrong. I explained I already told him I wanted to used the ingredients in the fridge for dinner during lunchtime. He said he just made the pasta for fun and we don’t hv to eat it for dinner tonight. I don’t understand what the point is to make fresh pasta and don’t eat it right away??!! 

The argument just kept going with “why can’t you make it any other time?” (me) and “I made it just now and we don’t have to eat it now!” (him)

I have two children (9, 10) from a previous marriage and one child that my partner and I conceived via sperm donor in the privacy of our own home. That donor child is now 2 years old and some change. He’s incredibly smart and my wife’s older family members constantly marvel over him and compare him to his cousins. My SIL (early 20s) got pregnant at the same time as us in 2021 and insisted on getting a membrane sweep two weeks before her due date and we had our children on the same day. It was my due date. Fast forward to yesterday, I went to drop off some groceries for my disabled in-laws and sat down for a second in the living room where the entire family was. my FIL started commenting on how my niece (my son’s birthday twin) might be getting taller than my son. My son is a big boy for his age, he’s off the charts for percentile and I’m not a fan of all the non doctors analyzing his body. I kindly said “I wish yall would stop comparing the babies, they aren’t siblings and even if they were that still wouldn’t be far.” My FIL started raising his voice at me “who is comparing them?!” I said the whole family. He kept raising his voice at me and started going on a tangent so I said “just because you don’t get your arguing fix with my SIL anymore doesn’t mean you get to come for me like this.” Because he has previously told my wife and I that he misses the rush from arguing and bickering with his daughter.

206,1dxxtrv,AITA for Being Concerned about my Mom's Health when she Deep Cleans the House 3x a Week? ,"I live in a small house (1500 sq ft with 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms, no pets) with my parents. The concern I have is my mom is deep cleaning the house too much.

I want to clarify this is not about maintenance cleaning. I understand this is important and we work together to do tasks like dishes, laundry and vacuuming the kitchen. We also clean the kitchen counters with Lysol at the end of the day.

The issue I have is that my mom is deep cleaning the house 3x a week. Here are the tasks she thinks are important:

1. Dust, Dry Swiffer, vacuum all bedrooms as well as wipe down desks with Windex.
2. Dust, Dry + Wet Swiffer 2 bathrooms. Deep clean the shower tub/tiles (only one bathroom has a shower), toilet, sink, mirror and walls.
3. Dust, Dry + Wet Swiffer living room. Wipe down tables, bookshelf and TV with Windex.
4. Vacuum stairs and wipe down stair handles with Windex.
5. Wipe down mirrored closet doors with Windex.
6. Bleach the kitchen.

My dad and I do help with these tasks (e.g. doing all the vacuuming and Swiffering), and my mom appreciates this. However, I am not at home all the time especially on weekdays when I am at school.

I think that this cleaning is excessive, given that we already do maintenance cleaning. Even looking online, I see that you only need to do deep cleaning tasks once a week. I have also spoken with other people and they said they might clean their house biweekly or once a month. For example, I went to my aunt's house which is 2.5x larger than ours and it is definitely not dirty or unlivable, even though they might do a deep clean biweekly or once a month.

My mom also has some injuries from the gym that she is recovering from so it is important for her not to do too much. She cooks dinner every few days and has other responsibilities outside the household so I'm not sure if it is worthwhile spending a lot of time cleaning.

I appreciate that my mom's desire to keep the house clean even when she is injured but I think it would be better to keep up with the maintenance cleaning and do a deep clean once a week on the weekend. We can all work together to clean the house.

However, my mom will not compromise because she believes these tasks are important otherwise everything will build up. We didn't clean the house for three days so after my mom thoroughly Swiffered the bedrooms, she complained about the amount of dust that was on the Swiffer. But I think the bedrooms were still very clean and the dust had been from three rooms so of course the Swiffer would get dirty.

I understand the importance of living in a clean house and help out with daily cleaning tasks as well as the deep cleaning. I am also grateful that my mom takes care of the house and wants what is best. I am just concerned about my mom's health and believe that deep cleaning three times a week is unreasonable.",No A-holes here,2024-07-08,"AITA for Being Concerned about my Mom's Health when she Deep Cleans the House 3x a Week?

For example, I went to my aunt's house which is 2.5x larger than ours and it is definitely not dirty or unlivable, even though they might do a deep clean biweekly or once a month.

My mom also has some injuries from the gym that she is recovering from so it is important for her not to do too much. She cooks dinner every few days and has other responsibilities outside the household so I'm not sure if it is worthwhile spending a lot of time cleaning.

I appreciate that my mom's desire to keep the house clean even when she is injured but I think it would be better to keep up with the maintenance cleaning and do a deep clean once a week on the weekend. We can all work together to clean the house.

However, my mom will not compromise because she believes these tasks are important otherwise everything will build up. We didn't clean the house for three days so after my mom thoroughly Swiffered the bedrooms, she complained about the amount of dust that was on the Swiffer. But I think the bedrooms were still very clean and the dust had been from three rooms so of course the Swiffer would get dirty.

I understand the importance of living in a clean house and help out with daily cleaning tasks as well as the deep cleaning. I am also grateful that my mom takes care of the house and wants what is best. I am just concerned about my mom's health and believe that deep cleaning three times a week is unreasonable.",4.0,1.0487287044525146,1,0
207,1dxxcio,AITA for lashing out on my Grandma ?,"ok so I (18F) have lived in a joint family my whole life. My grandparents, my parents and me and my brother. I'm the youngest in the house and a girl so I'm always working around the house. 

One thing that has happened time and often is that my grandma will blame me for something that is not even my fault. If someone left a used cup on the counter in the kitchen, I'll get scolded cuz obviously it was me ?? like srsly ? I don't get her logic. It happens so often that it really discourages me to even do chores cuz I'm the one who gets scolded saying i didn't do anything. 

This morning, the same thing happened. As i went to the kitchen to make tea, my grandmother started yelling at me saying how much of a disgrace i am as a girl (ik sexist much) that i didn't even bring the dirty dishes upstairs after eating yesterday. Mind you, i never went downstairs to eat, i just took a plate downstairs yesterday to feed my dog and that too, i brought up later to clean. I had no idea what dirty dishes she meant until i saw them on the sink. It was obviously not me but she would just not listen. Later my father came upstairs and told her that it was him who used the dishes and not me. Even then she refused to acknowledge her mistake and said "" it is something you often do so i obviously assume it was you "" .. MIND YOU, I NEVER DO THAT. In fact i am the one who collects and washes all the dishes that my brother/father/grandfather scatter around the house.

This time, i couldn't just control my anger and i lashed out on my grandma. I told her that I hate it when she does that everytime and blames me without any proof.

208,1dxx6qi,WIBTA if I turned down a trip to Europe to meet my BIL's family?,"Background: I (25F) have two older sisters, Claire (27F) and Emily (29F). Emily’s partner Ryan is from Europe, but they met in Canada (where we all live) 7 years ago. Emily and Ryan live across the country from Claire, myself, and our parents. Emily and Ryan got engaged last fall and then decided to get married a month later without inviting us (no hard feelings, they had some good reasons to do it). We planned to go on a ski trip to Europe in winter 2025 to celebrate their marriage and meet Ryan’s family (I’m the only one who’s met them as they happened to overlap with a visit I made to Ryan’s city a few years ago). That has been the plan for the last 8 months or so.

About a month ago, they told us that they wanted to scratch the idea of a ski trip next winter, partly due to their jobs/schedules and partly due to Ryan’s father’s declining health. Instead, they want us to tag along on a trip to Ryan’s city for a week this October. This is where I might be the asshole, as I’m not sure I want to go for a few reasons.

First, I just went on a solo trip to Spain in June. I budgeted and saved for 6 months to go on that trip, and I did not plan on spending any significant amount of money for the rest of the year for that reason. For the trip they want to take in October, the cost of the flights alone would be over $1,000, on top of accommodations (which are notoriously expensive in Ryan’s city) and other expenses during the week. In total it would probably end up costing me over $2,000. I could scrounge up the money but it would cut into my savings which I’ve been trying to build up. 

Second, I have already used or booked all but 2 days of my PTO this year. I can use those 2 days and then work a couple weekends to get “extra” days off to go on this trip, but that would leave me without any PTO from now until the end of the year. 

Lastly, I’m just not sure I want to go on the trip. I’ve already met Ryan’s family and while they seemed nice based on the short amount of time we spent together (less than a day), I’m not super interested in spending a whole week with them. I would like to visit Ryan’s city at some point, but I also don’t know if I want to go with my entire family, for various personal reasons. 

I talked to Claire and my parents and they feel similarly, but I still feel like it would be rude to turn down this trip and I don’t want to hurt my relationship with Emily or Ryan by saying no as it's important to them.

I think I might be an asshole because I can make things work budget and PTO-wise to go on the trip, but I don’t really want to.

210,1dxwyb4,AITA for telling my boyfriend it’s weird he uses his hazards while breaking in traffic,"My boyfriend (28m) and I (25f) have just wrapped up a very long cross-country road trip. While traveling, we naturally encountered traffic jams and during some of the more abrupt stops, he put on the hazard lights of the car whilst braking. I brought it up that I find it kinda weird that he does this, and maybe it isn’t necessary. I guess beyond the fact that I’ve never heard of someone else doing this, I worry about other drivers around us. I told him what if the person behind you takes it the wrong way… but that’s probably me over analyzing. Idk it seems like a bit of overkill? 

He got frustrated with me for being a backseat driver and asked me to stop nitpicking (paraphrasing) his driving. I get that, I guess I just still think it’s weird!

So, AITA? Do people think this is normal?

For clarification, we both live in the US, he grew up in the midwest, I’m from the easy coast, and we were mostly on major highways during our drive

UPDATE

It has been so interesting to see how some people, like me, have never seen this before, while it is custom practice in other countries. Boyfriend is very proud to be driving like the best, I am excited for him and really admire his cleverness (he started this of his own accord and also rarely sees it on the road). Definitely have learned something and have had my mind changed! 

I admit I am still learning how to not backseat drive and comment on small things. I agree that at the crux of this is my nature to control. I really didn’t mean the word “weird” to be mean, however. I am a naturally curious person, and I really appreciate the comments from those in long-term partnerships offering really great suggestions for communication in the form of curiosity rather than criticism/critique. My favorite perspective that I saw a few times is he may have been overly cautious since I was in the car. We read many of these together and when he saw that, he agreed that is a big part of it for him. 

I am lucky to be in a relationship where these instances of using the wrong language are not the end of the world, still I am going to work on my approach and reflect on why I feel the need to comment.

As an aside, we actually got the idea to post this from the Podcast Smosh Reads Reddit Stories, which we listened to a lot on our long drive. This was my first post and have never really explored reddit, so I agree with those saying this could’ve been better suited for other forums like no stupid questions. And yes, I googled.

212,1dxwvfi,"AITAH For un-RSVPing from a wedding, one week before the wedding?","Hello! I wanted to ask this question too get a second opinion, but let me give you the context first!

I got invited to a former co-workers wedding about a week ago and it will be held this coming Sunday, 7/14. At first i was very excited to go and rsvped a couple days after i was given the invitation. Now everything kind of went a bit downhill when I began looking for a dress (i was just invited as a guest I am not in the wedding party). I work a 9-5 so I started to realized that with my job ending quite late in the day, I wouldn’t have much time to go out and get a dress. Another thing that has held me back is money. Money has been pretty tight for me these days and I can’t really afford to buy a dress and shoes id only wear once.

Transportation has also been quite the issue aswell so nothings really working in my favour. And of course did message the bride about my absence. I feel really bad for un-rsvping but the invitation was given so last minute (i did not mention this to her as I wasn’t looking to stress her out any more than she might already be), and im just not in a place where I can spend money on a dress and shoes on the fly as I have absolutely no time and not much to spend.

So AITAH for un-RSVPing one week before the wedding?

EDIT: I fully forgot to mention this originally but I will be sending the couple a gift off their registry regardless of the situation. I had that planned since I got the invitation.

EDIT #2: I just wanted to thank you guys for all your opinions to help me better understand what I could’ve done differently. I will use this as a learning opportunity and use all of your tips next time a situation like this might arise. Id also like to mention that in no way was I trying to sound like I was just spewing out excuses to get out of going.
