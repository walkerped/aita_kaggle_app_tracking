0,1dyy4e7,AITA for not inviting my sister's wife to a family event because of her previous comments on my son?,"My husband Sam (39M) and I (39F) are celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary via inviting our family members for dinner. We decided we just wanted to be surrounded by the people we love.

I love my sister Charlotte (35F) very much. However, her wife Kate (38F) has never really fit in with our family. We all love and respect her of course, but just for context most of the misfit stems from her being a consevative lawyer and marrying into our super-liberal family.

Now I usually would definitely invite Kate to this event, along with Charlotte and their kids. However, during our last family dinner at my parents' house she made rude comments abiut my 18 y/o identifying as non-binary. Kate insisted she was still a she, that this whole thing is made-up, etc. She ultimately stopped her comments by Charlotte's intervention but I doubt her views have changed.

Now because of how she insulted my kid, and how hypocritical I think it is of her to be mardied to a woman and still say these things, I decided not to invite her and only invite my sister and their kids.

Ever since the invitations have been sent, Charlotte is very mad, and says she would mot attend the party, nor would their kids, unless I apologize and invite Kate too. I explained how her behavior affected my kid and they were very deeply hurt. And I pointed out how Kate never apologized. Charlotte is usually a sensible person but I would be lying if I said Kate's behavior hasn't rubbed on her a bit

We are both from same country, currently residing in foreign country and we become connected through mutual friends three years ago. We became quite close as we bonded through our homesickness and also other struggles of living outside your home country.

Over 3 years, I have become to know that she has a lot of childhood trauma, family issues and also relationship issues as she shared a lot of stories about these to me. At the early stages of our friendship, when she first shared about these trauma, I just listened and try to give some words of support. I also felt close to her as I thought she trusted me to share her inner feeling. However, after hanging out many times, I realized we do not have a lot of interests or views in common. But she is always kind to me and often take cares of me like a big sis so I felt attached to her.

However, since last year, I decided to distance myself from her a little as I was getting uncomfortable listening to her problems with her bf (mainly bf's immature personality and cheating). When she first talked about it, I was always on her side and agreeing she should move on but the situation became awkward, when she get back together with him and this repeated three or four times during the years since I have known her. So I decided not to involve in her dating matter at all. But the situation has become worse currently when she shared her news of keeping pregnancy with that bf but he threatens to leave her while they both know she needs his support on childcare.

I felt conflicted as I know she is going through really difficult time and I am the only friend she can talk to about this but also I know that I, a broke college student, don't have ability and resources to help her navigate this situation and she won't respond to me when i try to give her solutions.

Whenever he drinks I try my best to stay away from him by any means necessary, whether it be staying on the main floor with my grandparents and aunt, as he's usually in the basement watching TV (and drinking.) Whenever he's intoxicated he inconveniently wants to hang out with me because he wants an ally because none of my family is on his side, and I've made it clear that I'm not, either, because his recent behavior has been toxic and manipulative.

He has also said some incredibly rude things like ""you're fucking stupid"" and ""sometimes I wish you weren't my son"" thinking for whatever reason that it isn't unacceptable to say things like that.

Last night, he tried to get me to watch a movie with him. I politely declined his offer, but he then proceeded to threaten me, saying he'd force me to go to bed if I didn't comply. I told my grandmother about this, and he literally lied to everyone saying that he said ""you can watch a movie with me, OR you can do whatever you'd like until it's time for bed."" To stabilize the situation, my grandparents and aunt, despite knowing he was lying, said that he probably misspoke and didn't mean what he said, and the situation ended there, and I was not forced into watching a movie with him.

9,1dyomy4,AITA for asking my sister to delete pictures of my face from her social medias?,"Me (13) my mom, and my dad just got back home from visiting my sister (26) and her boyfriend. We are half siblings and we live halfway across the country from them.

A few days before we left, we wanted to take pictures, as we usually do. So we took some and I hate them. I didn’t smile or whatever, I just don’t like the way I look in them. My mom (unlike my sister) asked me if she could make one of the pics her profile picture and I said no, so she didn’t. My sister, however, was extremely rude.

Once we had gotten home, I saw her snap story and it had 2 pictures that I just happened to be in. I asked her nicely if she could remove them and I told her that I didn’t want them up there. She said “It’ll be gone soon it’s fine” and I told her how she didn’t ask for our permission (me, mom and dad were in those pics).

A few days later, which is today, I saw her Facebook post. It had 3 pictures of me, my mom, and my dad in them, and I was in 2 of them. I had politely asked her to take them down and I said how I don’t want them up there in the first place and how she didn’t ask (once again). She told me “I don’t need permission to post what I want on my own social media. Relax dude.”

I said how that’s insensitive to my feelings, and that it’s my face that I don’t want up there. She said she’s not going to fight with me, so I told her to delete them. She of course said no, so I turned it around and pulled one of their cards, which is “it makes me uncomfortable”. Her and her bf ALWAYS say this and express their feelings/opinions when they’re uncalled for, but I can’t have these feelings? Like wtf?

She then said how she “wouldn’t be bossed around, sorry” when all I did was NICELY ask her to remove a few pictures. I told her that if she was sorry she’d delete them. She wasn’t going to respond to me anymore unless the topic changed, she said. I just told her flat out “I don’t fucking want them up there”.

My sister texted my mom about it first. “I’m not arguing with your child, do something about it”. Mother said how my feelings are valid and the conversation is over. We are both ignoring her now. She texted me and asked if I was texting her off my mom’s phone, and she asked the same thing to my mom.

Mom powered off her phone and before that, told my dad about it kinda. I also told him. I sent a screenshot to him of me and my sister’s conversation.

My sister is a therapist. Keep that in mind. That cannot go well for her patients.

TLDR; Sister posted pictures of me, my mom, and dad on Snap and Facebook, was being rude about it for no reason, and refusing to delete them once asked nicely multiple times and told how I felt about it. She never asked to post them in the first place.

10,1dyojhp,AITA for not reconciling with my father?,"AITA for not reconciling with my father?(Posted this 8 months ago and thought id give an update at the bottom! thank you all again for the support on the original post!

(sorry for any typos and poor formatting im typing this on my phone)

For context I(20f) and my dad (45?m) got into a pretty large fight a couple months back. We have had a pretty strained relationship since my mom left him and got remarried.. 

My dad and I argued constantly argued.As On my two days off I would go out and spend time with my boyfriend. Im a full time college student and have a full time job. ive never been wild child. We would argue about me not being home often. he wasnt either because he worked out of town.

Fast forward to about 5 months ago our arguments started turning into how he was upset that I would go spend time with my mother once or twice a week or spend the night there. she has custody of my little sister and recently had a baby with her husband so the only time I got to see them is when i would go over there. He hated my mother for leaving him and said I was being disloyal to him by actively trying to be around her and her new husband. 

at the beginning of August he took the car he gave me for graduation to prevent me from going to my moms. This caused me to miss some college classes almost resulting in me getting dropped from classes, missing some work which luckily my bosses were like family so they understood and helped me get rides. And i was told to figure out how I was going to get around, luckily my boyfriends mom allowed me to use her car. Shortly after this i was at my moms and he was out town, and he called me absolutely losing his mind that i had been at my moms (he had me on life 360) and told me to get my shit and figure it out. 

In a lot of our arguments he has said this to me and i would constantly beg him to reconsider but this time i was done, i replied ok and hung up. i asked my mom if i could move in woth her to which she said i could and called my boyfriend to help me move out and that same night i started packing my things. 

Within 3 days i was out. A couple weeks went by and i remembered my name was on the utilities.I got ahold of his girlfriend and let her know i would be taking my name off but tell the companies to leave them on a week in order to give them time to get it in their name so they didnt go without power or water. When i did this he called my mother absolutely losing his mind calling me vindictive and saying i was only doing this to get back at him. He also stated i better give him any deposits i get back from them, i told him i wouldnt be doing that as i paid the initial deposits when he couldnt and he never gave me the money back for them so i would be keeping the leftover. 

Now to the initial point of the post, some of my family think im being childish and petty for not trying to work things out with him and better our relationship. they think i should be the bigger person and apologize for taking my name off the utilities and try to reconcile. So AITA for not doing that?


UPDATE! 
So its been 8 months since all this has happened, and i just wanted to say thank you to everyones input! my relationship with my dad is still complicated, although we are slightly talking again, i still have not met up with him in person because im trying to keep boundaries as he is very manipulative and i know if i go see him in person its likely ill get sucked back into the bs as im a bit of a pushover when it comes to him. Ive been seeing a therapist and she thinks its a good idea to keep distance. Two months ago he called me asking me to essentially commit a felony for him (cant really get into that) and then tried to gaslight and manipulate me into doing it after i said no, i almost caved but luckily my boyfriend talked some sense into me. We didnt talk for a few weeks after that but are now. Although its difficult because whenever i try to give him little life updates on things going on he seems very uninterested and inconvenienced by the conversation. I also graduated college with my associates in may (it was a 2 year) and although i told him the date and time 2 months prior he said he would make it and then texted me two days before saying he couldnt get out of work and didnt come. So things are still rough with us and ik i should cut contact at this point but hes my dad and i love him so its been really hard to do so.

11,1dyoi1e,AITAH for not giving up my bedroom at a vacation home for my brothers step kids?,"Apologies for how long this is in advance. 

I(20f) am on vacation with some of my family at my mom’s vacation home. The family pertaining to this story includes myself, my mom, my brother, my brother’s wife, my niece(11f) and my brother’s two stepsons (6m and 8m). They also have an infant together, so 4 children total. Infant is staying in brother and sil room. Sil’s sons are difficult children. They are mouthy, do not listen, and she does not make an effort to control them. They also have intentionally hurt my dog(pulling her fur, pinching her, etc..) But that’s bedsides the point. 

My mom’s cabin has 4 bedrooms total. The master(my moms room), downstairs bedroom one(my room), downstairs bedroom two(brother and his wife’s room), and then a smaller bedroom that adjoins to the bedrooms my brother is in, where the kids are staying. The adjoining bedroom has a futon that my niece is sleeping on, and an air mattress that belongs to my mom that sil’s sons are sleeping on.

Arrangement worked fine for the first week we were here. But yesterday, I walked past the room the kids are in and saw the two boys jumping on the air mattress and trying to launch each other. I popped my head in and was like “hey don’t do that you’ll break it.” They ignored me. Later that day the two boys come running into the living room saying the air mattress had a hole in it. What a surprise.

Obviously the mattress deflated and is now unusable. I figured the kids would all share the futon or assumed their mom would figure it out, since her sons were the ones that broke the mattress in the first place. 

I overheard my sil talking to my brother saying that I should have offered to give up my room for her boys. She said I could easily sleep with my mom and now her sons have nowhere to sleep because I “was selfish and rude.” I’m genuinely shocked, nobody asked for my bedroom, was I supposed to read her mind? And no part of me wants to share a bed with my mom because her children are out of control and can’t listen. Why should I have to? I said nothing and acted like I never overheard the conversation. The 3 kids ended up all staying on the futon, zero issues and they seemed fine doing that. I stayed in my room. 

The mood is just soured now, even though sil doesn’t know I heard her saying that. She’s acting rude towards me. 

TLDR: My brothers stepsons busted the air they were sleeping on at my mom’s vacation home. My sil got pissed at me because I did not offer my bedroom to them. 

So, AITAH for not offering to give my bedroom to the two boys?

However a year later, clearly she got comfortable(a bit too comfortable). I figured because we were close I'd tell her about past wrong things i did and regretted. At that time i had liked a guy in our friend group who also liked me back. We weren't together but yeah anyways he and i got a bit akward after i had to tell him that i wasnt allowed to date anyone out of my relgion. I don't know what went through her head but she started bringing up things about my in the past infront of him. Calling me a hoe and stuff. I grew up with guys so i had alot of guy friends but for some reason she found it necessary to point that out everytime saying "" watch she again, goin' fuh man."" it got really uncomfortable being around her also considering the fact that she had a 'friend' who she didnt like bc she was a pick me but she was only 'friends' with her because she wanted to attend her birthday party. i got uncomfortable knowing how fake she was infront her then act like she was her nemisis behind her back. idk if i was jus paranoid but i had a feeling she was doing that to me aswell especially with how she was acting around the same boy i had like. (mind you after telling her gay bestfriend not to get with a guy bc he's so bad and ugly . she got with the guy and broke up with him after a week bc she didnt see the spark anymore) i started ignoring her after failed attempts of trying to explain to her that i wasnt comfortable with her saying those things. after about 2-3 weeks she sent the boy i liked to ask me what was wrong. i told him and he escorted me to her were we had a whole arguement about it. i brought up what she had done to the boy who liked her and she had the audacity to say ""keep him and me out ah yuh mouth. that is not your business"" (not even to say i found out about it, she told me all about him and her delusions she had) i was honestly shocked that she would say that after all the terrible lies she said about me. then she had the audacity to say i called her a hoe(i didnt) and then say everything she did was a joke. she didnt even think about how i would feel she jus laughed and said it was a joke.

We became close and we'd do things high school friends would do. However a year later, clearly she got comfortable(a bit too comfortable). I figured because we were close I'd tell her about past wrong things i did and regretted. At that time i had liked a guy in our friend group who also liked me back. We weren't together but yeah anyways he and i got a bit akward after i had to tell him that i wasnt allowed to date anyone out of my relgion. I don't know what went through her head but she started bringing up things about my in the past infront of him. Calling me a hoe and stuff. I grew up with guys so i had alot of guy friends but for some reason she found it necessary to point that out everytime saying "" watch she again, goin' fuh man."" it got really uncomfortable being around her also considering the fact that she had a 'friend' who she didnt like bc she was a pick me but she was only 'friends' with her because she wanted to attend her birthday party. i got uncomfortable knowing how fake she was infront her then act like she was her nemisis behind her back. idk if i was jus paranoid but i had a feeling she was doing that to me aswell especially with how she was acting around the same boy i had like. (mind you after telling her gay bestfriend not to get with a guy bc he's so bad and ugly . she got with the guy and broke up with him after a week bc she didnt see the spark anymore) i started ignoring her after failed attempts of trying to explain to her that i wasnt comfortable with her saying those things. after about 2-3 weeks she sent the boy i liked to ask me what was wrong. i told him and he escorted me to her were we had a whole arguement about it. i brought up what she had done to the boy who liked her and she had the audacity to say ""keep him and me out ah yuh mouth. that is not your business"" (not even to say i found out about it, she told me all about him and her delusions she had) i was honestly shocked that she would say that after all the terrible lies she said about me. then she had the audacity to say i called her a hoe(i didnt) and then say everything she did was a joke. she didnt even think about how i would feel she jus laughed and said it was a joke.

If our kids are full before their plate is gone, we let them leave the table but save their plate in case they ask for a snack later.

Recently my husband has been not allowing the kids to have a snack after dinner even if they finish their plate. I’ve been arguing back saying “they finished, they’re allowed a snack.” Tonight our 7 year old asked for a snack after dinner and my husband flipped saying “don’t ask again you’re not having any more food tonight.” I told him he was being unreasonable and snuck my 7 year old down to have a clementine and a banana.

18,1dzh963,AITA for objecting to my roommate having guests stay overnight for 5 days?,"I live in 3 bedroom house with three roommates, and we are all in the Navy.

 One of the guys has had his fiance living with us for the past week, and he also dropped on me today, saying that he is having his Mom and two sisters(19F & 7F) coming into town. I said, “Cool, where are they staying?” he replied that they were staying at our house on the pullout bed in the living room.

I obviously objected to this because our house isn't that big, the living room is connected to the kitchen, and because we are in the Navy, we are up and about at 6 AM, which means we would cause a stir. It also means I won't be able to wind down at the end of the day and watch TV in the living room.

I then suggested they stay at the Navy Lodge, which is FAR cheaper than places out in town, and he brushed off my idea and said, “Well, they are to see me.” 

It's frustrating how someone can be such a cheap ass (especially since he's an officer), stubborn, and inconsiderate. I told him I wasn't ok with this arrangement, and then we got into a fuss, and he thought I was the one being unreasonable.

Any ideas on how to delicately approach this?

19,1dzh8yr,AITA for telling my son’s friend's mom she shouldn’t be mad at me?,"


My son wanted to have a sleepover with his friends the weekend, I (35F)told him that it was OK, but I had to get permission from the parents first. His friends lived in the same neighborhood as us so I already have your parents numbers, but I always make sure it’s ask. 

My son made friends with. New boy around the neighborhood, he’s known him for about a week and went to invite him. I was happy he made a lot of friends, I talked to the boys dad, he is a single dad and he is very nice so he does everything on his own.

 I got to know him so he could trust his son around me, he allowed his son to come over and was thankful the other boys were nice to him. I like to make my son's sleepover fun for him and his friends, the theme was “Welcome to Vietnam” I made the boys pho noodles and other dishes. 

The boys were having a good time until loud banging came to the door, I thought it was the cops honestly. It wasn’t the cops but it was my neighbor and a woman with him, turns out it was the boy's mother. She wasn’t very nice, she was upset and asked me to get her son because he shouldn’t be over here. 

My neighbor tried to calm her down, he was embraced, I didn’t know if I did something wrong but I did get her son for her. I did feel bad for him because he was having fun, I tried to talk it out with her but she wanted her son. I told her she shouldn’t be mad at me because her anger was directed towards me. My neighbor told me they have bad co-parenting and whenever he sees other women she gets upset, so maybe that's why?

She didn’t want him staying over because she doesn’t trust other women with her kids? Odd but this was her weekend and I can understand that but the sleepover was just for one night, I do believe my neighbor should have said more in the conversation, but he just stayed quiet so I assumed that she ran everything. But again she is his mom so I can't blame her, This wasn't their son's first sleepover during her weekends. He's been to many but only if there was a man In the house, I do want to reach out to get the full story. I know it probably was my fault because only knew my neighbor for a week so I blame myself for not getting to know both parents. 

The reason behind her outburst was that this weekend was hers to have her son, my neighbor told her he was going to stay at my house and would drop him off tomorrow but she didn’t like that. I was highly embarrassed because the mosey neighbors heard all the yelling, I can understand because it’s very quiet around the neighborhood. The boy seemed used to his parents arguing, he was sad and I wished he could’ve said but that’s his mom. Aita?

23,1dzh22g,WIBTA for apologizing on behalf of my boyfriend?,"BACKGROUND: My boyfriend “Brad” (21M) and I (23M) are both members of an online community (I won’t say which one in case he finds this post, but you’ll probably figure it out) which holds annual conventions. One of the biggest ones just concluded this previous weekend, which I was in attendance of. While there, I recorded the opera performance of another, very popular and well regarded member of our community, “Gary” (33M). Gary is a gay man who has a child from a previous relationship. I briefly interacted with them both a day after his performance, and offered him the video footage I took of his performance for his socials, for which he was extremely grateful and opened up some brief communication between us. 

THE ISSUE: When I mentioned to Brad that I met Gary’s son, he was extremely confused, and said that Gary shouldn’t be able to have a kid because he’s gay. Brad is on the spectrum, and despite my explanations, was having trouble grasping the concept that Gary had a child before he realized he was gay, and that he didn’t just always know that he was gay. Brad made two replies to Gary’s posts on Twitter asking how he could have a biological if he is gay. In the interaction, Gary initially made light of the awkward interaction before he stopped responding to Brad continued questions. 

“Zeke” (19M) is a friend of both Brad and Gary, and shared screenshots with the former of Gary, usually very bubbly and enthusiastic, tersely explaining that he was divorced from his first wife, which finally made Brad understand where he messed up. 

I’ve been trying to get Brad to reach out and apologize to Gary for the invasive questions he asked Gary in a public forum, and for likely bringing up painful memories for Gary, but he’s refusing to do so, partially out of embarrassment, partially because he still doesn’t believe that he is entirely in the wrong. 

I’m considering reaching out to Gary on the line of communication we previously established, to apologize on Brad’s behalf, as I might be able to explain why Brad interacted with him in the way he did better than Brad can himself.

Thank you everyone for your input. After some prodding from me and Zeke, Brad finally sent off a message apologizing to Gary, thought he still insists that what he did isn’t that bad. That fact makes me worry about the legitimacy or the earnestness of the apology, but at this point, I believe that’s between him and Gary. Again, thank you all for setting me straight on this (ironic, since no one in this story is straight).",Asshole,2024-07-09,"WIBTA for apologizing on behalf of my boyfriend? BACKGROUND: My boyfriend “Brad” (21M) and I (23M) are both members of an online community (I won’t say which one in case he finds this post, but you’ll probably figure it out) which holds annual conventions. One of the biggest ones just concluded this previous weekend, which I was in attendance of. While there, I recorded the opera performance of another, very popular and well regarded member of our community, “Gary” (33M). Gary is a gay man who has a child from a previous relationship. I briefly interacted with them both a day after his performance, and offered him the video footage I took of his performance for his socials, for which he was extremely grateful and opened up some brief communication between us. 

THE ISSUE: When I mentioned to Brad that I met Gary’s son, he was extremely confused, and said that Gary shouldn’t be able to have a kid because he’s gay. Brad is on the spectrum, and despite my explanations, was having trouble grasping the concept that Gary had a child before he realized he was gay, and that he didn’t just always know that he was gay. Brad made two replies to Gary’s posts on Twitter asking how he could have a biological if he is gay. In the interaction, Gary initially made light of the awkward interaction before he stopped responding to Brad continued questions. 

“Zeke” (19M) is a friend of both Brad and Gary, and shared screenshots with the former of Gary, usually very bubbly and enthusiastic, tersely explaining that he was divorced from his first wife, which finally made Brad understand where he messed up. 

I’ve been trying to get Brad to reach out and apologize to Gary for the invasive questions he asked Gary in a public forum, and for likely bringing up painful memories for Gary, but he’s refusing to do so, partially out of embarrassment, partially because he still doesn’t believe that he is entirely in the wrong. 

I’m considering reaching out to Gary on the line of communication we previously established, to apologize on Brad’s behalf, as I might be able to explain why Brad interacted with him in the way he did better than Brad can himself.

25,1dzgyoj,AITA for lecturing my bf instead of not being solely supportive?,"Hi everyone, 

I am looking for some outside opinions on this matter. I (30F) have been with my bf (31m) for 7 years and he is extremely caring, kind, and does a lot for me. We have had this ongoing issue in our relationship that drives me crazy however, and that is that my bf is an ultimate procrastinator/drags his feet type of person. I am convinced he has ADHD as stimulants helped him at one point and he has a very difficult time focusing on tasks. He has never been diagnosed but I suspect this may be a cause as to why he does or does not do a lot of things and I have urged him to maybe seek help in that regard.

Anyways he has not been to the doctors since he was 18 when his mom used to schedule his appointments. He waits until last minute or until something is extremely wrong to do anything about it. Such as he waited to go to the dentist until he had severe mouth pain and then found out he had like 8 cavities due to not going for years. I have discussed the important of just going to the doctors for checkups and even giving him places and numbers. He still doesnt have a PCP. Around the house he will leave cups or dishes everywhere, or laundry on the ground and I ask him constantly to pick up after himself, he says he will but then never does, or does it weeks later. Recently something huge happened with his job where he has been placed on furlough. He does not have a lot of savings and so I discussed getting on unemployment until he gets a new job. He applied a few weeks ago and did not read about what he had to do and so this Sunday came and went and he never certified and thus lost out possibly on a weeks worth of unemployment. I am currently in a different state for school but this has also been stressful on me as he is the sole breadwinner currently and I dont want him to have to dig into savings. This led us to an argument earlier in which I felt like I had to lecture him again about the importance of this and staying on top of it. I know he hates getting lectured and it shouldn't be my responsibility but at the same time I feel like I always end up being the one who has to do anything to get something done. He will do this with the health stuff in which he will complain about a problem like back pain and then not go to the doctors and so I have to hear about it all the time even though he chooses not to do anything about it. In this case he complained about me not being supportive and just saying like ""sorry you can file next week"" or something similar. Instead he claims that I just lecture and I am never supportive which I don't feel is true. It can be so frustrating though for me and I know it is probably because he has ADHD and needs some help with that. I also know I can only do so much but I am at a loss as to how to help him or just be supportive if he doesn't want to do anything about his problems.

26,1dzgxjr,AITA for not showing up at my birthday meet-up because I don’t like one of the guests,"It's my birthday today. My flatmates, who are also my friends, wanted to celebrate, so they organised a small get-together. I don't like being the center of attention, so I asked them to treat it as just a casual hangout and not a birthday celebration.

We confirmed the plan, and my best friend even baked a cake, insisting I should have some. A few hours before the meet-up, I informed the guests that I might leave early due to a migraine.

Everything was going well until a guest, Gee, showed up. I know that my flatmates invited Gee, I just didn't expect her to show up because it was already 10pm, and we had been hanging out for 3 hours already. 

Because of some recent issues between us, and I was uncomfortable with Gee being there.

Gee and I are from the same country. Last month, when I visited home, she asked me to bring back some items for her—dresses, makeup, cosmetics, and food. I accidentally left her makeup and cosmetics behind. Although I apologised and offered her to use mine until she could replace hers, she was upset and ignored my messages, stated “apologies can’t change anything”. Gee later borrowed some makeup from my flatmate for her trip. My flatmates didn’t have the items Gee needed. I do have them, new, and unused, but she still ignored me.

The whole friend group knew about the issue and explained to her that I didn’t do that on purpose, and I forgot my stuff as well. She still refused to listen and kept repeating that I didn’t take her make-up & cosmetics here for her.

For the whole month, she ignored my messages and stopped participating in the group chats that I was a member of.

When she got back from her trip (1-month trip), she complained that I didn't text her while she was away, even though she had ignored me. She said that she had no problem with me and that I must hate her now because I didn’t text at all during her trip while everyone else did.

I don’t really text anyone just to check on them. I only text someone privately when necessary, the rest will be on group chat. And I was active in group conversation during that time. It was her that stopped participating.

Also, a few days before her trip, I went through a breakup and was heartbroken. I didn't expect her to check on me (she never did), but it frustrated me that she blamed me for not texting her during that time.

When I mentioned in the group chat that I might leave the meet-up early, Gee texted my best friend, suggesting it was because of her - she said something like “is it because I read messages on the group chat that’s why she was unhappy”? This annoyed me further. I felt like whatever happened - Gee always tried to make her the victim.

When Gee arrived, I immediately left said it was my migraine, asking my friends to save me a piece of cake. I don't want to cut ties with Gee; I just need time to process my feelings toward her.

Now, my flatmates tell me Gee is crying and blaming herself for my leaving, and I feel bad about making her cry and missing my best friend's cake.

Kayla: Ok but you hang out with AJ more. I think you can spare an evening for me. I didn’t yet see you last week. Come on kiddo. I’ve switched days for you I think I’ve been more than fair.

Me: I’m great full and stuff. But guilt tripping me isn’t going to make me want to spend more time with you. I’d want to spend time with you because i love you, not because I’d feel obligated to. I do want to spend time with you

28,1dzge3g,AITA for not going over to my girlfriend's house?,"I'll keep this as short as possible. My (23F) gf and I (23M) got into it today. Long story short, I was supposed to go over to her house, but I left later than she wanted me to. When I said I was leaving, she said not to come because it was too late. I responded saying sorry it was too late, I wasn't trying to be late, we just didn't have a set time, and 2 hours prior when I told her what time I was planning to leave (which is when I left) she said okay. She said still no, so I said okay. She flipped out saying i was being an asshole and should have come earlier and to come. At that time, I'd gone for a walk, so I said I'd walk back, then leave. In response, she said never mind. This went back and forth a few times, with a few fuck yous and saying she didn't want to see me for a few days. I kept agreeing to come when she changed her mind, then saying okay when she went back on it. Anyway, I finally got fed up and said I wasn't going to come. She said to just leave since I was home and all she had wanted was for me to come over. I said then she shouldn't have said those things to me and told me not to come. I stayed home. She is pissed. 

For context, it's not uncommon for her to have a severe reaction to minor things like this, where there wasn't even a set plan and I certainly didn't do anything malicious. She says a lot of nasty things that she doesn't mean, but never apologizes for them. I usually end up trying to placate her for a couple hours before doing what she wants.

29,1dzg8qs,AITA for asking my mom to lower my rent?,"AITA for saying my mom is charging me to much for rent?

I need help yall…so long story short my mom (f45) left my dad because he’s always been pretty verbally abusive and an attention seeker and due to that, my mom was constantly ignoring me(f19) as a child. She recognized that she wasn’t paying enough attention to me (like not taking me to the doctor or helping me with life stuff) and she left my dad to start doing better. When her and I were looking for a place to move, she told me I would need to pay rent which is COMPLETELY fine! Except I was expecting maybe 650$ maximum… For some information, We live in oregon. My mom has a full time job that pays her 25$ an hour and she works nearly 50-55 hours a week and she gets paid weekly. Due to her not paying much attention to me as a kid, i never had my Social security information or anything like that so I was never able to get a job until 16-17 and didn’t get my license until I was 18 and often had to pay for my own dinner/food and toiletries etc.. So i was never able to save up any money. I ended up getting a loan as well for a PC and also have an active credit card.  I had a full time job at the same place she works at for 19$ an hour 35 hours a week, paid weekly. The apartment she found and applied for denied us at first due to her terrible credit. (that is important later) she’s always been pretty bad with money…anyways. Once we were able to get approved for that apartment, rent was 2000$ for a 2bed 1bath. 
She told me I would be paying 900$ a month plus my car insurance that I pay her which is 150$ a month. I absolutely cannot pay that much! Keep in mind I am also paying for my own toiletries, food, gas, loan payments and credit card payments. 

She ended up needing emergency surgery and so I was out of a job for 3 months unable to pay my loan and credit card off. I was asking her for help with my taxes so I could get some money back and she told me she needed to take it all for rent…anyways…Everytime I ask her to lower my rent she gets mad at me and tells me she can’t afford it. But she spends nearly 80$ a week on cigarettes and I am always seeing packages at the door for her… My name is on the lease so i’m afraid I can’t leave. Am I an asshole for asking her to lower rent? am i asking for to much? Would I be an asshole if I left and found a place with a friend or something cheaper? I’m 19 years old and in debt!! I just want to save money and get my credit score up so I won’t get denied an apartment at 45 years old…does anyone know what I could do ?

EDIT i should have mentioned that we just got a termination letter saying we missed rent…yet she went and bought cigarettes the same day!! and threatened me by saying my name was on the lease too and my credit would be effected

But she spends nearly 80$ a week on cigarettes and I am always seeing packages at the door for her… My name is on the lease so i’m afraid I can’t leave. Am I an asshole for asking her to lower rent? am i asking for to much? Would I be an asshole if I left and found a place with a friend or something cheaper? I’m 19 years old and in debt!! I just want to save money and get my credit score up so I won’t get denied an apartment at 45 years old…does anyone know what I could do ?

EDIT i should have mentioned that we just got a termination letter saying we missed rent…yet she went and bought cigarettes the same day!! and threatened me by saying my name was on the lease too and my credit would be effected 




SECOND EDIT: I put it all together and she’s getting roughly 4000k a month..genuinely unsure of where the other money is going",0.0,0.05987648293375969,0,1
30,1dzg220,WIBTA if I made my sister sign a contract every time she gives something to me? ,"My (17F) sister (21F) is the type of person who just throws away or gives away fully functional stuff she doesn’t want anymore. A camera, a projector, a mini printer, a phone, an IPad, a whole MacBook that she got as a gift, the list goes on. She’s gotten into the habit of having me go through her “trash” before throwing it out because she also tends to not care if anyone else’s items are in there as well, and she lets me take whatever I want from there. 

The problem is that she doesn’t remember giving away her things, and she also takes any doubles that our parents get for us and thinks they’re hers. For example, we each got a furby for Christmas one year and she took mine, claiming it was hers because she knew she had one of them. 

Because she doesn’t remember giving me things or taking the doubles, I’ve written up a simple contract that we’d both have to sign every time she gives me something, or every time I give her something. I’m also thinking of putting a stamp or simple colored dot on all my things in case she ever gets a similar thing. 

I feel like I might be TA because I could simply stop accepting things from her instead of making her sign a contract (which is a crappy thing to do in general with family members, and doesn’t really feel right) but it hurts my soul to see her just toss out things that are generally useful or valuable. We grew up very differently in our formative years, so please don’t blame her for being how she was raised with getting rid of expensive things after they no longer interest her. What’s hers is hers, and I’m completely fine with that (as everyone should be), but I just can’t stand being called a thief anymore.

My mom was only visiting 7 days total. I told my mom no and started taking down the curtains she hung. I asked her what about the other curtains and she fucking thew my girlfriend’s grandparents curtains away. We have a trash shoot so I don’t even know where to start on that one.

I send the Canidiate an email telling him he has an interview. He goes and gets hired because he's desperate.

I think I could be wrong that it would prompt my boyfriend to voice an opinion on a mutual issue, but what I think she felt bad about is that I told her a truth she didn't want to hear because she and her roommate had sex a couple of years ago, and that’s the main reason of my opinion.",2.0,0.07498016953468323,0,0
38,1dzeuu4,AITA: Estate Inheritance ,"Am I the asshole?

My fiance and I currently live together (in the home he bought before we met). We have been together about 3 years. He was struggling with money for awhile since he had to get a new job and take a pay cut. I'm pretty successful and had a lot of money sitting around, so I helped pay his bills for a few months before moving in. He did pay me back for this. He had a lot of credit card debt and that's obviously impossible to get out of just paying the minimum, so I paid off all his CC debt and he now pays me back monthly. There's no trust issues-I know I'll get all the money back.

Fast forward to last Christmas, his dad unfortunately passed away. They didn't have much of a relationship, but his dad didn't have a will, so my fiance became executor and technically inherits ""everything"". His dad lived with his girlfriend of two years, but left nothing to her. He did leave his retirement account and life insurance to his niece that no one had ever heard of; she inherited $150k and no one knows why and had never met her. Anyways--my fiance has been the executor and just sold his dad's house. After paying all the debts, he anticipates having about $100k left. I obviously was super excited that despite the situation, he would be able to pay off all his debt (car loan, student loans, me, etc.). We also need to do some renovations to the house and had some things we had been wanting to do, etc. We figured all the debts and expenses will be about $60k.

We were chatting and he tells me that he probably won't be able to pay it all off. I asked what he meant because it was plenty of money. He stated he was going to split the money 50/50 with his dad's girlfriend. I'm baffled and we have been fighting about this frequently. I'm not saying he should screw the girlfriend over, but 50/50 seems ridiculous to me. He could at least do 60/40 and be able to pay everything he needs to, but he insists I have no say in this and he has made his decision.  They weren't married and the dad left nothing to her (instead having his niece as the beneficiary on most things). My fiance also gave the girlfriend his dad's HD motorcycle for free since that was what they enjoyed doing together. I said he should at least factor that in and still do 60/40 since he gave her a free motorcycle. He just says no and ends the conversation. 

I'm pretty pissed that he has the opportunity to get out of his poor financial situation but is choosing not to. I feel annoyed that I had to help him with bills and debt, but it seems like he can't even help himself. I can appreciate helping someone else in need, but he should look out for himself first. 

Should I butt out and not worry about it since he's the executor and I'm not? AITA for consistently bringing it up and not being grateful that he's a good guy that cares about the girlfriend too? ",Asshole,2024-07-09,"AITA: Estate Inheritance  Am I the asshole?

I 18M , she 18F have been dating each other for the past two years and are close to each other, but our relationship became a lil sour when we entered 11th grade because she had a different stream and I was in a different stream her in PCB and I in PCM so we had different classes and different coaching centers. So as a result as the year went by we met each other very little and because of the different subjects which were difficult we were not able to give time to each other but after a few months she told me that some of the students(boys) in her coaching were asking about her number and always following her on her way back to the home i told often told her to tell her that she should discuss this matter with her parents because that way those boys wont be lurking around her, but she said that she does not want to bother her parents and get the parents involved in this matter, we often had fights about this topic that if this thing bothers her then why she does not tell this matter to her parents. To help her i asked my friend from the same coaching to go with her when she goes home so the other boys wont bother her.

Soon this kind of became an everyday thing and we used to have fights because she was acting differently in school and i felt like that i was not being treated right because having fights every day after 6 hours of school 3 hours of coaching and a minimum of one hour of driving is pretty tiring and having a fight after this surely was not a good thing.

At the same time in my coaching i joined late so i had to catch up to the syllabus so i got to know about the topper of the coaching who was a girl initially she shared notes with me then gradually she came to my house for teaching the things i didnt understand and i went to her house for learning physics nothing more and in just one visit her grand ma told her that she feels that i am a good guy, we became friends but i didnt tell my girlfriend about her because i thought that she will get jealous of her which will lead to more fights so it was something she didnt know about.

Then it was the time of new year night when her i and few of our friend decided to go to some cafe and celebrate new year in that place she sat next to me and when the food was server she said that her hands are cold because she did not ring her gloves so i thought feeding her one spoon wont hurt,after that we came back home while she was sitting behind my bike but after a few days went by my girlfriend asked me about where i was on new years evening so i replied that we went somewhere and she started crying and went home later i found out that one of my friend snitched that i fed her with my hand and since she did not know about her she thought that i was cheating behind her back. But the truth is that i never saw her (the other girl) in that way and neither did i ever touch her or did anything bad to her. Since i thought that this will hurt my relation ship with my girlfriend so i decided to cut her off from everywhere when my coaching ended and haven't had a talk with her ever since. 

I tried to talk to my girlfriend that i was not cheating and just did not tell her about that girl. but she kept on insisting that i was a cheater and this counts as cheating itself somehow i accepted that i did cheat on her by not telling my gf about her (the other girl) she still fights wm about this and i told her that i have learnt my lesson and wont do this ever to her but when ever we have an argument she tend to add this cheating topic which of often say that it was not cheating.

40,1dzelby,AITA for telling my husband I am done with keeping him and his bad attitude up when he just got laid off at work?,"For context this particular instance was not his fault, despite him being no stranger to losing jobs.

 He worked for a company that shut down on the 20th and has been extra cranky and rude while job hunting and fighting battles of self worth in his head despite anything I have done to try to offer kindness and understanding and reassurance. Including making him a nice resume and applying him for many jobs. He has also applied for jobs and done his part with all of that.

 I have also worked everyday because of this, including weekends since June 20th without a day off to try to make up for however long he will be unemployed for. 
So it's been a lot of stress, and my job is already extremely high stress and commission based.

So I had a final doctor's appointment before our insurance runs out today regarding my medication follow-up for ADHD and anxiety. Buspirone and guanfacine.. nothing crazy but super helpful for me. Especially with how much work I have been doing. If I didn't go I wouldn't get refills at all, even if I end up having to pay them out of pocket.

I have incredibly bad white coat syndrome that probably stems from diagnosed health anxiety and so I asked my husband who had nothing else planned at the time, no job interviews, etc, to please come with me to my appointment to help me manage my anxiety. He agreed, and despite him being on his phone playing games the entire time and shutting me down anytime I tried to talk to him, I was just thankful to not be there alone. 

Well my blood pressure reading was pretty dang high, as it always is when I go to the doctor, and so I told him when I went out and he said it's my fault and that I purposely find things to worry about. His tone was not just callous, but like someone that just absolutely despises you. There was not any kind of comfort or even care despite knowing how horrible I felt at that momemt. It was one of the most cold responses from him to date. 
I told him that I didn't want to be so anxious and that I'm trying to manage it, but there have been A LOT more stressors lately, including his constant attitude.

I told him I was at the point where I could not take it anymore and have asked him to please go stay at his parents, which he absolutely refuses to do. I told him that I have never felt more hated by someone my entire life.

Am I the asshole for not giving a bit of lead way with how stressed he also is? 
He has suspected but not confirmed bipolar disorder and takes medicine that doesn't seem to do much of anything. Even before us losing insurance soon, he has refused to try to alter his medication in any way and has completely forgot it on occasion.
I can't tell if I'm just so exhausted that I'm hyper focused on all his bad qualities or if I'm just fed up.

TLDR;
1. I told my husband to leave and stay with his parents because I was sick of keeping him up after a disagreement. 
2. He says it's my own fault for stress and that he is not going because I shouldn't cause unnecessary stress to myself by worrying about everything and that I'm an asshole for trying to make him leave his home for my own problems.

Edit: I have tried telling him we need to divorce entirely because I don't feel like we are compatible and he will not leave the house that is in my name and has my work office. He is a frequent screamer at myself, family, friends, and has lost several jobs from anger issues and getting into it with his boss or customer.

Ex partner has had a 10 year addiction to doing and selling cocaine and its always been part of our relationship but has really only become a issue between us in the last 9 months or so.
 last week things hit the ceiling when he lied (again) to my face about not doing it and then I found him doing it in my living room at 630am when I got up for work. I told him pack a bag and stay somewhere else for thr weekend.  A few days laster he called and made me open my safe where the rest of his stash was and that was the last straw for me; I texted his parents in a really really emotional state essentially saying goodbye, he chose the drugs over me, us, and bettering  himself again and that I changed the locks and told him to leave for a while. They already know about his problem with blow and have known the whole time he's been doing it.  
They are incredibly supportive and loving and had welcomed me into their lives and into their family for the several years I knew them.  I've talked to them about his problems with drugs and how our relationship has been affected by it many times and I always found support and understanding with them. 
Today my (now) ex came back to my house and screamed at me that I don't understand that he's an addict, that I've betrayed him by talking to his parents, I've disrespected him, that I'm a snitch,  that he'll never forgive me, and that it's over forever.  He said we could have worked on us but after what I did there's no chance because I made it about me.

I'll admit I'm no perfect person or partner, I try my best to be an advocate for myself and my safety and mental/emotional well-being while being understanding about his issues. I felt the need to protect myself from him and his actions because he's hurt me so many times with his addiction and behavior.

I probably was too hasty in talking with his parents, but I really didn't know what else to do and I felt like I needed some support from people who wouldn't judge him but rather would want to help him.

And now here we are my dog sleeps in the garage because my husband hates her and says he doesn’t want her sleeping in our room. Well right now we have a massive heat wave going on. At night my garage is still 85+ degrees. He insisted she still sleep out there. We have fought about my dog so many times. And honestly he is the only person that has negative feelings towards my dog. She’s a doll, the sweetest thing. When she gets scared from fireworks she might have an accident because she has a damaged bladder. But that doesn’t happen hardly ever. My husband hates her and she is terrified of him because he makes it so obvious he hates her. Around my other family he hides his hatred towards Mia. And is constantly telling her to get away from him and move out of the way. Called her names before. So anyway I told him today I’m done. I’m not doing this anymore. He just said ok. I know we will fight when he gets home but

44,1dzdlqn,AITA for closing the door on a charity doorstep caller for my girlfriend?,"Hi all, I closed the door on a charity caller tonight who was convincing my girlfriend to sign up to a charity. Looking back on my behaviour, I'm absolutely mortified I did what I did but got caught up in the heat of the moment. I'm hoping to understand better how much of an asshole I was.

To preface this, my girlfriend is an incredibly kind soul who doesn't want to upset or disappoint anyone. For reference, she's previously met up with Mormons despite not having any interest in joining the religion, all because she didn't want to disappoint them. She also likes making people feel like they've had some small successes.

We had a cold caller knock on our door tonight. My girlfriend answered it and it was someone working for a charity trying to sign people up to donate to deaf children.

The two of them were chatting for a bit whilst I was in the other room. She then agreed to sign up to a mailing list and give all her contact details, and then eventually make a monthly direct debit to the charity. When I heard this, I went through to the door, said that we had no interest and closed the door on him. He seemed slightly confused but didn't really object or push back.

My reasoning for this is that I hate these kind of cold callers who, in my view, often rely on people being too kind to say no or old people, to donate to a cause they cannot really afford or have no interest in. I've also had a bad experience in the past where I was too awkward to say no, but when I offered my donation, I was asked to donate more to make the boss happy. (At this point I gave fake details to get them away.) She has also in the past signed up to numerous charities ( all we can afford thankfully) and didn't want to see her pressured into signing up for another one.

We could more than afford the payment but up until he turned up, we had no interest or intention on donating to this charity. 

Understandably, my girlfriend was mortified with me and got upset that I did it. She then mentioned that the optics of me turning up and closing the door for her look absolutely terrible (this is definitely not the case in reality but I completely understand it!) I explained my reasoning but she was insisting she didn't mind donating to the charity for a while. 

Looking back on it, I'm absolutely mortified that I did it (think keep me awake at 2am kinda thing!) and I wouldn't do it again. I definitely got caught up in the heat of the moment and shouldn't have done it, but also I feel like my concerns about preying on older people and people who are too awkward to say no are a valid reason to do what I did to the cold caller.

As I write this, she wants to clarify that she does actually care for deaf children and believes that sign language should be taught in school.

45,1dzdd1v,AITA for taking my sons phone/tablet away on weekends?,"I (38f) have received from pushback from husband (44m) recently because I take our oldest son's phone from him on weekends to focus on sharpening his lacrosse skills and learning a new language because he said he wants to. He's 14 years old and he's expressed to my husband and I he really wants to go to Princeton to play lacrosse. I'm from the East but moved to Oregon once I got engaged and have been here ever since. That said, a few months ago after dinner, my husband comes up to me and tells me he doesn't think that Greyson will be able to have time to focus on his studies and training unless we came up with a way to get him off his phone. At the time, he only had his one phone, so I suggested we go and get a another phone line added to our plan but locked to where he couldn't download any apps. Only to call immediate family/911 in case of emergencies. (A ""dud"" is what our son calls it 🤦🏼‍♀️😂). 
  
 He thought about it and asked, ""then what?"" - then I told him my plan. ""We take the main phone he's had since 6th grade with all the social media stuff and games on it and keep it our room so that compels him to be a little bit more fastidious about his hobbies he's passionate about. He's a great student (for the most part😤😂) and he's pretty much a homebody so when decides to go out it's usually to the gym/park we have in our complex where all the kids his age hang out at so he's never far from home. We're going to Italy over the summer to visit some of my husbands family and that's the language I was speaking of that Greyson wants to learn and honestly... he wasn't practicing until we implemented this but now he's saying he feels drain from the routine. He's a tad closer with his father so he told my husband first, whom of which in turn told me... that was this past Saturday. 

  Since we've been trying that out his grades have gotten better. He's able to hold down a decent length conversation in Italian. He can read it the best out of all the skills but my husband and I are helping him every way we can. His workout regimen with drills and techniques has gotten crisper. Movement wise, at least he's way more agile now than he was before. Surprised to have seen it, but he cut down on junk food too which was weird to me but nonetheless. The best thing about this to me is he uses some of his allowance money to pay for the other line now too so he's learning responsibilities as well. 🥳 

So going back to Saturday, I went into his room and asked if he was feeling burnt out which he told me yes and no. I asked why and he said, ""because I'm still young so I have the energy but also because I'm so young I want to goof around with my friends too while I still can"". I asked if there's something else he could do and he said he'll push through it for now. He still wants to go to Princeton and break their 2022 scoring record 🤞🏻. And that he's super stoked to go to Italy. He says he's getting married on vacation 😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️.  I don't know why, but I cried later that day and it's been on my mind ever since. So, AITA?

46,1dzd3ov,AITA for inviting my family to my (F24) and my fiancé’s (F25) wedding against her wishes?,"Throwaway just to be safe. Me and my fiancé, let’s call her Alex for anonymity sakes, just got engaged. It was pretty funny, since I asked her and she was planning to ask me only a week later. We both had beautiful rings picked out for one another and everything was great. And then we started wedding planning last week. She began talking about who she wants to invite, both friends and family, and I said I’d have to think about that as well. She asked “What do you mean?” I told her I wanted to invite my parents and other family to the wedding as well. I could easily tell she was unhappy.
For context, most of my family is perfectly fine; it’s my mother that’s the problem. Way back when, in 2016, I came out to my parents. My dad was very accepting and happy for me. At first, my mom didn’t say anything, which I thought was just her quietly going along with it. It was only a few days later when I really started to see who she was. She started making snide comments to me about my sexuality and saying various slurs more often (f*g, d*ke, etc.). At this point in my life, I still had various insecurities and would rarely stand up for myself. After I met Alex in 2018, her remarks took a turn for the worse.
She would constantly introduce me to “nice, upstanding boys” for me to date. I’d firmly tell her that I was already in a relationship, but to her it didn’t really mean anything because it wasn’t a “real relationship.” Thankfully, through therapy and Alex’s support, I had better self confidence and pushed back against her. That didn’t stop any of my mom’s remarks of “I can’t wait for you to find the right man!” and “You’ll eventually grow out of this!” 
Now, at this point, it might seem obvious to cut my homophobic mom out of my life. I’d 100% do it if it weren’t for one thing: my sister. My younger sister, whom is 19, has severe Autism. I love her to death and would not be able to stand not seeing her again. My mother and I had a falling out once over a family issue, and she threatened that if I didn’t cooperate, I’d never see my sister again. I know if she doesn’t get invited to our wedding, she’d pull the same stunt. I absolutely hate how she uses my sister as a bargaining chip, but she and my dad have full custody over her. Alex knows all this, but really doesn’t want my mother at our wedding. I don’t blame her at all; I know she’d be most concerned about her younger sister, whom is MTF transgendered, and my mother is heavily transphobic. We have just started the wedding planning and it feels like we can’t get past this. So, am I just an asshole or am I justified?

Edit: For those asking, both Alex and I have always wanted a nice sized wedding. We want to have this rather than elope. Also, my father has kinda been walked on at least for my whole life, so I’m not sure if he’ll go against his wife.

Quick Update: I’ve been discussing with Alex and we have agreed to not include my mother at our wedding, no matter what happens. We have not told her that she will not be allowed to come. I will also be having a sit down talk with my father about my mom’s possible outburst over this later this week. Alex will be joining us and we will also discuss the situation with my sister.

49,1dzbvcy,AITA for not letting Our Daugther not travel to my ex wife,"In 2012, I was sent by my company to work in the US, which was planned for 6 years. At the end of 2012, I met a woman there who was already pregnant.   
We dated until 2015 and got married at the end of 2015. When we got married, I adopted her daughter.  
Some background on my ex-wife: she used to have drug issues in the past, but when I met her, she was clean (confirmed by multiple doctor appointments over the next 8 months), she got pregnant by a one-nightstand, and she didn't know the father's name.  
In 2016, I noticed that she started using drugs again, and when I confronted her about it, she said that she recently started using again because everything became too much for her.   
That same week, when I got home from work, she had packed some of her stuff, left our daughter with a neighbor, and just vanished. That was the last time I talked to her until recently.

After having no contact with her for about half a year, I initiated a divorce, which ended up being a default divorce because, after a PI that I hired served her with papers in another state, she vanished again and never responded to anything I or the court did. In the divorce, I got full custody of our daughter.

So in 2017, after the divorce procedure ended, I had my company transfer me back to Germany so I would have family close by that helped me raise my daughter.

Recently, my ex-wife contacted me again and told me she had gotten clean and had stable work and an apartment again. We talked over the last few months and she asked if I would let my daughter fly to the US for 2 weeks over summer vacation so they could spend some time together.  
I categorically refused that and told her if she wanted to travel to Germany and meet our daughter, that could be arranged, but I would not send her to the US.

The problem is that I learned that if I sent my daughter to the US and my ex-wife would file for custody, she would not be allowed to travel back to Germany until the custody case was handled. I would have to travel to the US to figth the custody case, and the fact that I would want to take her back to Germany again would mean the chance that I would retain custody would be very low.

As a result, I very very rarely see my side of the family. I decided that I wanted to take a weekend trip to go down and see them, but I do not have access to a reliable car for the ~3 1/2 hour drive, but I get steep discounts on car rentals through work. When I put the plan to rent a car up to my wife, she brought up a second idea: Flying to Portland out of Seattle Int’l Airport, then back again. I have two problems with this: 1. I believe that it would not be more convenient for a weekend trip, and 2. Factoring in early airport arrival, transportation there/back, and time in the air we would probably be devoting more time to air travel than just driving. I explained them both to my wife and it resulted in a small argument over whether it would be cheaper/easier/convenienter to fly over drive. I finally told her I would rather not go than fly.

53,1dzb7eo,AITA for not responding to my girlfriend's emotions properly?,"I’m 31F, she’s 32F and she’s a trans woman. This is relevant for later.

I love my girlfriend to death but lately I feel like she gets herself into situations that hurt her mental health. She doesn’t have a therapist or any friends at all, so I’m the only person she has to talk to about situations that get her feeling down.

I try to support her as much as I can but sometimes it gets to be too much.

Monday night, she was obsessed with trying to find an old anime she wanted to watch, some thing called “You’re Under Arrest.” I have no interest in old anime like that so I just let her do her thing. 

I’m working from home today, and she wakes up at 12 noon as usual and says she had a rough mental health night last night because the anime she watched was really transphobic. It involved a cross-dressing character (AMAB dressing up as a girl) - all the other characters were trying to get this transgirl character to realize that they’re “really just a boy.” She watched the whole episode and it made her upset.

I tried to console her and let her know that it was dumb and fuck that and that’s not okay, and gave her a hug, and then when I thought she was doing better, I put my headphones in to just listen to some music and calm down, bc to be honest - I was upset at her for watching the entire episode and traumatizing herself further. 

She has a habit of doing this lately:

* She joins Discord servers that have rules like “this place isn’t for special snowflakes!” And then gets mad when the people in it are not LGBT+ friendly - look, I think it’s fucked up that people are homophobes/transphobes too! But please be wary of the spaces you join on the internet!!! 
* She loves fighting games so she joined a fighting game group that is entirely made up of men and then was upset about being objectified - like, please can you join a community that is an inclusive space for women??

So, I was trying to console her while also managing my frustration at her for watching a whole episode of transphobic content and not prioritizing her mental health. 

But she was pissed that I put my headphones in and went into the bedroom to sulk. 

I calmed down a little and went into the bedroom to listen to more of her emotions about it. She then said she felt better but was upset that I didn’t listen to her “properly” the first time. This turned into an argument that lasted all night.

I’m just dealing with a lot in regards to our relationship right now and I just get so frustrated having to be her everything.

* She has no friends so I’m her only support source and this takes a toll on my mental health sometimes
* She’s unemployed and has been so for the past SIX YEARS. She’s currently in a coding program to try to break into tech so I’m trying to be patient about this…

55,1dzaym0,AITA for telling my best friend that she should stop talking to an ex friend of mine?,"I (19 F) recently told my best friend (20 F) that she should stop being friends with my ex friend (19 F). for the sake of the story i’ll call my best friend Milly and my ex friend Jay. I used to talk to my friend Jay all of the time. We would hang out almost everyday and talk on the phone when we couldn’t. Last summer we both developed a bit of a crush on each other and we told each other about our feelings and all was well for the time being. After about a week though she told me that she no longer had feelings for me. This broke my heart because I had been writing her little paragraphs every night, in them I would describe everything I loved about her. I will admit I was a little obsessed. But as time went on, I got over my feelings, the friendship meant too much to me and I wouldn't let myself ruin it. After a few months we became friends again  and in the time we were apart I got closer with a childhood friend, Milly, she was always great to me, and had been there for me whenever I needed her. Milly was my best friend after my previous best friend (Milly's Boyfriend) cheated on her and I cut him out of my life in favor of Milly. Me and Jay were doing really well as far as I knew but after around two months she decided we should take a break. During her break she became friends with Milly, when the break was over I was really happy that we could all be friends. We started hanging out together and we were all doing well. Jay had been kind of pushing me to the side when I was with Milly. Jay becameore distant over some time. This was at a really low point in my life. I had recently been hospitalized for a suicide attempt and while I was staying at the inpatient mental hospital I would receive calls from Milly who would use my mother's calls to talk to me. When I got out Milly bought me a bunch of nice things. The last text I had from Jay however was that she couldn't live without me. But when I got out she ignored my messages for a few months. I started to hang out with Milly more often but I noticed that she didn't seem to care much about how upset I was with Jay. She told me that I was overreacting and I believed her. She had finally fully cut off her ex at that time but I was feeling extremely lonely and I had known him all my life. I began hanging out with him again and he was attentive to my problems and would listen to my issues with what Jay had been doing. Milly was pissed when she found out I was hanging out with him and she told me that it was either him or her. I chose her because he had hurt me in the past. Milly didn't seem to work any harder to care about my problems despite how hard I was working to show how much I cared about her. I asked Milly to start going to a pottery therapy class and she told me that she didn't like pottery and didn't have the time. I found out two days ago that she has just started going to a pottery class with Jay. She lied to me when I asked her about it. I had decided a few weeks prior that Jay was dead to me and whenever I tried to talk to Milly about is she would shut me down.

58,1dza2cg,AITA for asking my friend to not vent to me ?,"Made a reddit account for this.

About a month ago, my (23F) friend (26F) just finished an stressfully exam. I was happy for her and congratulate her, and I treat her to a nice dinner at a more expensive restaurant. During that time, she was venting to me a lot about her stress in finding work, breaking up with her bf, and family issues. I listened and tried to help her cope. We then scheduled to get brunch again on Sunday.

On Saturday, I was on my period which hurts and was trying to enjoy myself after a week of stressful work, I saw a call from her and then happily answered it. Basically, it was her venting to me again and to be honest, it stressed me out even more. I asked her to stop after 20 mins because I'm being stressed out, I'm not in the mood to listen to her venting. I thought she would be okay with that, but she was actually really offended and accused me of being a ""shallow friend"" (the original conversation is in another language the term is in between fake friend & shallow friend). She defines shallow friends as ones who only go eat meals together and can only share good news. I was really upset by that and said I have listen to her venting for a lot of times and for once I asked her to stop, she says we are shallow friends. It ended with that her calling off Sunday brunch because she said it's going to be the same (her venting to me) and she'll only contact me when there is good news. She think I'm an AH and a shallow friend for asking her to stop venting to me. I don't think so.

After asking some friends as well, I was surprised some people actually think I was too hard on her and should have just let her vent because she is so stressed. 

I really hoped she will clear her head and apologies, but it didn't happen. I sent a text after 4 days saying I'm disappointed and hurt and I feel like she doesn't value this relationship by not reaching back to me. It's been a month since then and she texted me she found a job and if we would like to have brunch, didn't apologies and with what she said before It was really upsetting. I rejected, politely but quite cold.

AITA for not allowing my friend to vent? Also any advise on if I should continue the relationship and let this go?

Some additional information: I very rarely vent to her, I feel she is stressed enough as she is and don't want to negatively impact her.",Not enough info,2024-07-09,"AITA for asking my friend to not vent to me ? Made a reddit account for this.

60,1dz9zn5,AITA for embarrassing my sister and saying she isn't as good as me?,"I 24 f have a younger sister 22 f. As long as I can remember my sister has tried to compete with me. My family is pretty athletic. My parents, older brother, sister, and I all played sports in high school and college, though not the same ones. It wasn't abnormal that my sister wanted to sign up for the same ones as me. Everyone thought it was cute that she wanted to do the exact same sports as me. Later it also became band and debate team. Everything I did, she had to do.

 That itself isn't the problem. My sister is super funny, always a hard worker, and generally a great person. The problem is she always did this to compete specifically with me. She made it known even when we were on the same teams that her mission was to out-score or out-race me. Even if she came second to last, as long as I was last, she would be happy. Even grades. She always got solid As or A- but I got As or A+. She was more interested in my GPA than her own. Her problem is, that never happened. Not once in almost 15 years. She's talented and a great athlete, but she could never beat me. I really didn't care. To me she was just like every other girl on the field/pool.

It died down when I went to college. I went to a private school on an athletic scholarship full ride. She decided to go to same school and join the swim team as well, but she didn't get a full scholarship, which was the first blow. My parents thought it was sweet. I knew it would be a problem on the first practice and she said something like, I'm not second best anymore. Like okay good for you. Just swim faster than the other team and I'll be happy.

Fast forward to this past 4th of July. We had a barbeque at the lake and she asked to race her for old time's sake. We were just standing around I wanted to swim and said sure. I swam pretty leisurely. I didn't care if she won. I was just wasting time. I still beat her back to shore and she didn't speak to me for a while.

Then she said we should change our wedding days to the same day to see who more people choose. I told her I just needed my fiance and the priest, which my family agreed with. She said I was no fun. I said, no this lifelong bulls*** is no fun. It's exhausting. She said deal with it because I'll always be her competition. I said that's funny because she's never been mine.

61,1dz9ria,AITA for telling my girlfriend she needs to get a real job and she will never be a famous comedian?,"31 M and my girlfriend is 28. Her and I have been together for 6 years and have been living together for the last 2. Going to attempt to keep this short so plz ask for details if I leave something out. 

GF has always enjoyed doing comedy and has done open mic nights since we’ve met shortly after college. She had a real sales job though that was her Monday-Friday 9-5 job where she made decent money. 

I have a good but hard job and make almost triple what my gf was making when she had her job. I said *had* because last August she quit her job because it was taking away from her comedy ventures. She told me a year from now she thinks she can really make it. I was a bit skeptical but since I make enough to support us, I encouraged her because I want to be a supportive boyfriend. 

Since she quit her job, she began doing Uber and DoorDash, which is where she makes 100% of her money. Her comedy has gotten us zero dollars. Over the past few months I have started to resent her though. She constantly complains she has no money, yet drives for Uber or DD maybe 3 times a week for maybe 4 hours at a time. I have been paying a lot more for household expenses and I’m not saving as much as I’d like to anymore. She sleeps til noon because sometimes her open mics run real late before she even gets to perform. And when she gets up she just bums around on tiktok and YouTube looking for “inspiration”. She also gets very moody with me if I don’t come to 90% of her open mic performances. Even after working a 14 hour day she will get mad if I don’t go to her open mic at 11 PM on a Tuesday. 

Last night, I did the unthinkable. I asked her to consider going back to a full time job. I said she should still do her comedy but I’m struggling with taking care of our expenses all by myself. When she gave a dismissive answer, I told her firmly that she will never be a famous comedian. I said she’s 28 and it’s time to grow the fuck up and join the real world because this is totally unfair to me that I bust my ass while she lives in La La land. And that she can’t be this naive at this age by thinking she’s going to support herself with this. 

She stared at me in silence for a few minutes, started crying and went to stay with a friend. She called me a fucking dickhead asshole and I’m the worst friend ever. She has not answered her phone today yet.  

So am I a fucking dickhead asshole?

Im a full time university student, but i live with my parents since my university is a 10 minute drive, or 45 minute walk. My mom drives me to and from university since im not allowed to drive, and my mom is a stay at home traditional wife. My dad is a high ranked Docter so he is always at work, i rarely get to see him on the weekends and nights after he would come home. Since he is kinda old i dont blame him for spending his free time resting. Max and Avery have a 9 to 5 desk job, both of them are managers in big corporations. And Hazel is in Kindergarten. 



Max got married to his ExWife Chloe. It was a rollercoaster of a marriage, but bthey eventually had 2 sons Tristan (8), and Luke(6) before they got divorced. Since Chloe left my brother she took both the boys with her. When the boys did come to visit their father it would be me taking care of them, entertaining them, playing with them, for the 5 hours they were at our house, Max would spend a total of 30 to 45 mins with them, rest of the time was me and my mom.  



Max got married again to Avery and had Hazel soon after.



Since max and avery both work corporate jobs, Hazel is left home with my mom and me. This has been happening since Hazel was 2 months old.

I hated Hazel from day 1 of her being born. 

Not only that, my mom is also expected to do laundry, and iron clothes and cook food. We do have a maid that does some of the works such as cleaning the bathrooms and bedrooms. But alot of it my mom have to do while taking care of a toddler. Not only that my mom also have to take her to and from school. Enen though we take care of Hazel, Avery and Max are super mean to my parents and they hate me too, especially avery since she wanted my parents to kick me out. She lied a couple of times and framed me for things that werent really true.

  


During Max and Chloes relationship, my parents favored them looked after their children, and forgot about me. I was being SA’ed and being bullied in school. I was forced to live through that alone because my parents didnt even notice me present. 

Eventually after max and chloes divorce my parents realized something was a bit off about me, and i told them everything, they werent very apologetic but took me to therapy, where i learned that i had severe ptsd, and it was slowly developing into schizophrenia. At times i still feel like my mom blames me for everything.

65,1dz920n,AITA for Canceling/Declining Best Friend's Birthday Gift of Concert Tickets?,"Tl;dr me and my best friend treat each other to dinner on our respective birthdays; this year on my birthday I was offered concert tickets as part of a group outing instead of a dinner and I declined as I was not interested in the artist performing or the length of the show

I'm going to be a bit vague with some details as I know my friend uses Reddit but (and I fully feel I might be in the wrong here) Me and my Best Friend are long distance friends but we usually try and see each other on our birthdays and treat each other to dinner and drinks and have a nice catch up. It's always just been the two of us so it gives us a chance to have a real meaningful conversation.  For a bit of background usually the person treating picks the location and type of cuisine. This year on my BF's birthday they mentioned that for my upcoming birthday rather than Dinner they wanted to take me to a concert instead.  At the time and not knowing my plans I said yes that would be fine and didn't think much of it at the time.  Now getting closer to my birthday I have found out more details.  The Concert in question is outdoors (our seats would be covered but still...); in a genre of music I don't enjoy; scheduled to be a little over 3 hours long; and not a dinner date but a group outing. I should also add that the concert is part of a subscription that my friend did this year and they get tickets for a group of people to all the concerts. All of this led me to be quite annoyed with the situation as it's not so much the genre of music but being in a group at a concert really does not allow me to have a meaningful conversation with my friend.

Thinking that's not really how I wanted to spend my birthday I let them know that I didn't think I could make it after all but wanted to see if we can do lunch before or maybe drinks after and got an very icy response.  I am worried that I might have ruined a friendship over this but honestly sitting in the August heat at a concert that I would never have picked out on my own sounds like a horrible way to spend my birthday.  AITA?

  
EDIT: Two points for clarity. 1) I was originally invited to the concert during my friend's birthday dinner.  It got brought up towards the end as we were saying that we would miss seeing each other in person until the next get together and I reminded them my birthday was in just a few months. 2) My friend is not out any money per se for the concert tickets.

We have been together for over a year and I know that she has had some history with drinking before. She was fired from her job couple of years ago because she arrived at work under influence. After that, she was sent to AA and since then claimed she doesn't have any desire to drink anymore. I know that she doesn't drink often since we started dating, however, I know of maybe six occasions when she did. I found empty bottles couple of times but she always promised she stopped. I trusted her maybe first three times that it was just a relapse and that it wouldn't happen again but I started growing suspicion. 

Couple of months ago I secretly went to her place   (we don't live together) and found maybe ten bottles of wine that she probably drank during a weekend when we weren't together. She got mad at me for violating her privacy and I am certainly not proud of this but we settled it and I was hoping it was really the last time.

Then all was seemingly ok for another couple of months until I again left for a week. Today I was watching netflix on her laptop because mine broke (we don't have a problem with sharing laptops and both know each others passwords). As I was closing it I saw a gmail shortcut in her browser and clicked it. I found out that she had been ordering alcohol during the days I was away.

Now, she noticed that I was acting weird because I can't hide it and pretend that everything is ok. I told her that I was suspicious she was drinking for which she obviously got mad and left. I didn't tell her that I checked her emails yet and now I am thinking how to confront her. I know it is bad to check through her emails but I also think it is justifiable when I suspect she has been drinking.

Just a side note, she suffers with severe mental health problems, so obviously the drinking is making it even worse and she should really stay away from it.When we were together, she drank only in moderation, maybe a one drink and that happened just a few times.

She finished school in May, and stepdad hasn’t left yet. They live in the same house, in different rooms, etc. My stepdad cheated and spent their savings on porn sites.

She got Tinder. She fell head over heels for this guy. He’s 45. The first time she told me about him, she was reading the conversation; he has never been married or doesn’t have kids. Being the daughter I am, I did some research and found out he’s a felon. within the same week, he tried to ghost her bc he didn’t like how she was out “running the streets.” (she went to Walmart with my brother late at night.) They stopped talking. The following week, they started talking again and going out on dates. He flipped because he wanted her to stay home, care for the house, and not mess around. So they stopped talking again. One Sunday, Mom was at my house. I asked how things were with him. She told me, “he’s crazy. We’re done,” and she “doesn’t want to deal with his crazy.” later that night, about four hours later, she wasn’t responding to me (I needed help).

A week later, they stopped talking again because she had lost an earring, and he wanted to buy her some. They were at a kay jeweler, and he lost his crap apparently and was yelling at her in front of everyone, so she left. 

She turned her location off the other day, and I asked why. She said she didn’t realize it was off, and it stayed off. I left it at that.

sorry in advance for bad English

I tell my parents quite a bit. in general in all areas. I don’t tell stories, my orientation, my thoughts.

Mom, I greatly distort the stories, because if I don’t do this, she starts to worry, ask her to never do this again, like it’s dangerous, and so on. for example, when we went swimming in the local lake and roasting marshmallows, I said that we were just sitting near the lake.

If I talk about my orientation, they will send me to a psychologist to “remove all the crap from my head” or they would say that it will pass with time.

and my thoughts are too disturbing even for me, so I just don’t want to upset her.

my father, in turn, hardly participates in my life, and I don’t feel very comfortable with him. Usually our greeting ends with “hello” and “bye”. plus he is a terrible homophobe and has already tried to even forbid me to watch Tik Tok, and every dialogue we have that lasts more than 2 minutes ends in a scandal.

Hi everyone I’m just looking for some advice and maybe someone else has gone through the same thing as me. 
For starters I’m a 26f and my MOH is 32f. We met 4-5 years ago and hit it off almost right away. We have been practically inseparable since. My choice was hard when I got engaged between my best friend who wouldn’t be able to help me at all or my current MOH who would be able to help me with every last detail since she is a SAM. I explained to my best friend this, and I thought she understood but our friendship has definitely suffered from this decision. 
Anyway, my MOH was great at first. Helping me with big things, small things, crazy things, you name it. Always there for me. By happenstance we had to change the date of our wedding from 2023 to 2024, families and friends were made aware, but I think this plays a key part is some of the things we are currently going through. While planning for this change, we came to the realization she would also be engaged by the end of 2023. We talked about what would change and what would need to stay the same. Mainly, we would focus most of our efforts towards my wedding (not all by any means because I don’t want to take away from her day either), and then refocus all our efforts to her wedding and her needs after my wedding. We both agreed on this and we both understood that we would have to manage our time and efforts together and separate for the two weddings. Since she got engaged and we talked she has changed. Instead of being there for me, she cut me out almost completely. 
We used to talk everyday multiple times a day; however, now it’s like pulling teeth. She bails on appointments that were set up for weeks. She has been to one wedding related thing with me in 6 months. She was also supposed to be the one to do my hair and makeup, and I have had to set both of those up on my own now. So instead of spending time with my girls before the big moment, I am now going between businesses to get everything done. She also made a huge deal to plan an engagement party for herself, yet hasn’t bothered to plan a bridal shower or bachelorette party for me even tho I asked. My parents have taken one to plan and other bridesmaids have tried to plan the other. 
I tried to call to talk about this and was sent to voicemail. I tried to text about this and was left on read. I just feel like I’m out of time and options here and could really use some advice on how to handle this going forward. I would love to hear her side of it but she seems to be avoiding the topic and me all together. 
I haven’t fired her as on today, but would I be the asshole in this situation if I did? Most of the people I have talked to have said I wouldn’t be in the wrong but a select few have told me that would make the asshole. ",Asshole,2024-07-09,"AITA: thinking about firing my MOH AITA: firing my MOH

I just feel like I’m out of time and options here and could really use some advice on how to handle this going forward. I would love to hear her side of it but she seems to be avoiding the topic and me all together. 
I haven’t fired her as on today, but would I be the asshole in this situation if I did? Most of the people I have talked to have said I wouldn’t be in the wrong but a select few have told me that would make the asshole. ",1.0,1.0401318073272705,1,1

73,1dz7ife,AITA for yelling at this woman in front of others after she talked to me in a derogatory manner?,"I (F18) and many others were waiting for the elevator to come. In front of me, there was a woman, let's call her Amy, who was also waiting with her bicycle. While waiting, she kept pushing her bike repeatedly, kicking me in the knee. She was staring at me through a mirror next to the elevator and saw that I was right behind her. I usually do not confront people immediately, so I just let out an exaggerated sigh, hoping she would get the hint, but I was wrong.

So, the elevator came down, and Amy rushed in with her bicycle. She walked in and stood right in the middle. She moved only when I pushed her bicycle slightly to the side; she still took up half of the small elevator. Only Amy, another man, and I fit in there. The rest didn't fit because the man refused to move closer to me, and I was already glued to the corner due to the lack of space.

No one pressed the button for a few seconds. The woman turns around and asks if anyone pressed the button. The man then did it. Then, the woman looked at me from head to toe with disgust and said to the man: ""That girl could have also pushed the button."" She kept talking about me right in front of my face. So, I removed my headphones, looked her in the eyes, and told her stoically: ""I can hear you."" She laughs mockingly, turns to the man, and says: ""See, that girl can see us!"" I replied: ""I didn't say see, I said hear. Besides, you could have pressed the button as well."" She then accused me of being glued to my phone and that I should look up sometimes. I got irritated and told her: ""I can look wherever the hell I want, for how long I want and whenever I want. Who do you think you are to tell me whether I can be on my phone or not?""

At that point, we arrived at the surface, where another older woman was waiting. Amy said, ""Well, it wouldn't have hurt for you to press the button!"". I turned around one last time, looked her in the eyes, and yelled at her: ""You have two perfectly functioning hands, don't you!?"" She started stammering. I didn't wait for her reply; I just ended this discussion by yelling: ""Yeah, you do, right!? So use them!"" Everyone around me was shocked at the tone and loudness of my voice. The man grabbed the woman and pulled her away, and I resumed my way back home.

I usually follow the motto: ""When a dog starts barking at you, you don't go on your knees and start barking back."" I don't want to waste my time on such people, and I know that it makes people look idiotic when they try to fight with someone who isn't even engaging with them. But this time, I couldn't keep my anger in. If the woman had kindly asked me to push the button, I'd have done it in a heartbeat. But the sheer arrogance and entitlement from her, alongside her face of disgust and her talking badly about me right in front of me, pushed me over the edge.

75,1dz79ck,AITA For refusing to do yardwork after my wife built a garden,"My wife (29F) and I (31M) bought our first house this past winter.  The house is in decent shape, but the yard needed a lot of work.  We spent the winter planning what we wanted to do with the yard in terms of landscaping.  My wife has always wanted a garden, but I have a severe bee/wasp allergy and I did not want to plant a bunch of stuff that would attract those insects to our yard.  She kept begging me to let her build a garden and told me that there are going to be insects in our yard anyway.  I carry an EpiPen with me pretty much all the time when I'm outside, but I would prefer not to have a deadly threat in my yard at all times.  

I went out of town for work for a week about 6 weeks ago.  When I got back, I saw that my wife had done a lot of work in the yard.  She had bought a few raised planting beds and started a little vegetable garden.  She had also dug up a couple areas on both sides of our driveway and planted a bunch of native plants and flowers as pollinator gardens.  

I'll admit, my first reaction probably wasn't the best.  It was something along the lines of ""WTF are you thinking?""  We got into a pretty big fight about it because she kept downplaying how much of a problem it would be for me.  She kept saying things like ""They won't sting you unless you bother them.""  ""They are going to be in our yard anyway.""  ""Native pollinator plants are important.""  ""You have an EpiPen anyway.""  

Now, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with any of those statements.  But to me, she is inviting deadly threats into our yard.  And to make it worse, she is telling me it's not a big deal.  I told her that if she wants to keep all of that stuff in our yard, she just signed up for doing all the yard work by herself because I am not going to put myself at risk just so that she can grow a few zucchinis.  I am not going to mow the lawn or pull weeds if it means I might get stung.  

She told me I am overreacting but since she wants to keep everything she planted, she begrudgingly agreed to do all the yard work.  Well, now that summer is in full swing, she doesn't like that arrangement.  She complains that it's too hot and the yard work would go a lot faster if both of us were doing it.  She complains that the grass grows too fast and doesn't like having to spend time every weekend mowing.  But then she will also post videos on social media about all the bees that her pollinator garden is attracting.  

This past weekend she told me she was too tired to mow and asked me to do it.  I told her that we already agreed she would do all the yard work since she wanted to keep her gardens.  She again told me I am overreacting and that I need to help.  

I told her that I am not putting myself at risk when we both know there are more bees in our yard now because of her gardens.  I have taken on a lot more of the household chores to compensate for her doing the yard work, so it's not like I'm slacking off.  She refuses to see things from my POV.

76,1dz781c,WIBTA? My mother in law seems to be insulting me while spending time with my children and putting them down at times.,"Hello! I hope y’all read to the end. Sorry if this is long winded. I need to vent and need advice. My MIL has been making little comments to my children that seem to be putting me down. She is very intelligent and writes code for a living. She prides herself on that to a fault at times as she comes off pompous and egotistic. Even my 8 year old twins have noticed. They complain every time they go to Grandma and Papa’s. They say she can be mean. My FIL is terminally ill with Huntington’s disease and I really want my girls to spend as much time with him as possible. He’s declining quickly. 

So a few examples of possible insults directed at me have been mentioned by my daughters. The first one is MIL telling my daughters after one of them used “um” that anyone who uses “um” and “like” while speaking sound dumb. I’m a Bay Area California girl. I say like from time to time. MIL knows this as she’s mentioned it before. I let them know while they really shouldn’t make using interjection words a habit that does not make them dumb. 

Yesterday my girls were visiting my MIL. They mention to her they love doing art on their nails and want to be nail techs when they’re older. MIL tells them that’s a bad idea because it’s boring and the same thing over and over again and not creative. I’m a former nail tech. She knows this. My daughter also mentioned grandma called her strange for decorating a band aid she had on her finger. This hurt my daughter’s feelings.

 I feel like these examples among a few others from the past need to be brought to her attention. It’s upsetting my girls and I don’t want it to ruin their time with my FIL. My husband and I have validated our girls feelings and they know Mom is smart and strong and kind person. I know my MIL loves my girls. She moved 1,800 miles to live near us. I know there’s a loving person in there and I just need to get through to that side of her hopefully without fallout. 

 Will I be the asshole for bringing this to my MIL attention or should I let it go? My husband will be there and has my back. He’s type A but even tempered so I need him there to mitigate. She doesn’t deal well with conflict or criticism and is very defensive and has been hot tempered. Any advice is welcome! ",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-09,"WIBTA?

For example he’ll say “I’ll be there in 30 minutes” and it’ll be an hour or more later that he arrives. Or occasionally he doesn’t show up at all. I’ve had conversations with him and expressed it’s not being late that’s agitating. if he’s running behind, that’s fine, but it’s the constant no communication. I’ve explained that I’ll be ready in the time period he says he’s arriving and then end up sitting, doing nothing and waiting longer cause he didn’t say anything.
I’ve told him time and time again it feels very disrespectful, a notification is all that’s needed and it’d be chill. But he refuses to do that or acknowledge that he’s being disrespectful. It happens so much so that anytime he comes over the first 30 minutes becomes an argument and makes to the point I almost want to tell him just go home.

I (29M) recently had a significant gain in the stock market. For context, I spent all my life savings on stocks, which upset my wife (28F) as she wanted me to limit such investments to just my personal money. Despite her concerns, I managed to make a substantial profit, gaining $300,000.

Now that we have this money, my wife wants us to move to a bigger place. We currently live in a modest home, and she believes it's time for an upgrade, especially with the financial cushion we've gained. However, I feel differently. I see this $300,000 as an opportunity to further invest and potentially grow our wealth even more. I think it would be a smart move to reinvest the money rather than spending it on a new house.

This has caused some tension between us. My wife feels like I'm prioritizing my financial ambitions over our quality of life. She argues that we deserve to enjoy the fruits of our hard work and take a step up in our living conditions. I understand her perspective, but I'm worried about missing out on further investment opportunities that could benefit us even more in the long run.

80,1dz6o6r,AITA for yelling at my sister over towels?,"I'm currently on a family holiday with me [17F], my sister [16F] and my parents [41F & 43M].

Me and my sister have our own room for the first time, usually we'd get a big family room and stay in the same room as my parents. This is our first time with a separate room as its driving me a bit up the wall.

Lets start with last night. I have might have autism (so says my therapist) and I think it plays a part in my sleeping routine. I need very specific conditions to sleep and while I was ready to make sacrifices, I feel I've been robbed a bit here. I can't stand silence or white noise so I usually listen to some classical music. My sister said I could only play it if I used my ear phones (I only have head phones and thats uncomfortable to sleep with) so no music. I also like darnkess, but my sister likes light, so I compromised and said she could have her bedside table on. I also sleep naked which led to this morning.

Whilst standing next to the bathroom door (right by the front door) she told me to get the front door because our parents were knocking. I told her I was in bed and naked, so no, and that she should do it because she was right by the door and in pyjamas. She didn't get the door. Our parents just left and messaged us later. She then started telling me to get up for the day but I can't get dressed until I've had a shower and she was in the bathroom. She finally let me go first in the bathroom, and up & ready in 15 minutes. I had to wait nearly another 30 for her to be ready.

I asked her to sunscream my back because I can't reach. She squirts a bunch on, pushes it about a bit with her finger, then immediately washed her hands. I ended up having to walk down the corridor with sunscream dripping down my back to get my parents to rub it in.

The hotel provides 2 big towels and 2 small towels. I just came back for a shower to find my sister used both big towels. Luckily we'd brought some medium sized towels (not full body) with us, so I had to use them, and I got mad. I yelled at her, calling her inconsiderate and rude. She asked if I really needed 2 (since she'd used one of the big body towels for her HAIR) and I said yes, and why she should she get two and me one? She said, jokingly, that she was just awesome that way and I lost it. Its been an hour, I'm ignoring her by locking myself in the bathroom fuming. This is possibly my last family holiday before I go to university, and she didn't even want to come! She'd been complaining after doing her GSCEs about not wanting to come, then proceeds to take up all the sink counter room and uses the purple toothbrush (we bought a new pack of toothbrushes and I EXPLICITLY said I wanted purple and she agreed)

So AITA for getting mad at her over this?

83,1dz68dd,AITA for creating a plan for our shared flat?,"To start with my situation, I Silvio am a student and live with a woman Tina and another man Luca in a shared flat, we are all 23 and 24 years old.

Recently, Tina and I have had the feeling that we do more on day to day basis than Luca. It started with a compromise that we actually decided on together a month or two ago, which didn't even have a strict plan and was just about a few extra tasks that we were supposed to do in our weekly service. We talked about it in passing at the kitchen table, nothing formal. When it was L's turn to take on these tasks, he simply refused, saying ""I won't do it"" and then we were told that a proper WG meeting would have to take place and that he would never have agreed to it.

That was the point where Tina and I took a more critical look at our household and who did what on a day-to-day basis. I drew up a household plan that included lots of chores and in which everyone could enter what they had done that day and there were points for this, a few for small chores and lots for big ones, in addition to our regular chores at the weekend. There are no problems with this either, to be fair to Luca. The system provides that people who do few regular tasks, such as taking out the garbage, can earn points for larger or irregular tasks, such as cleaning the oven.

At the end of June, I organized a flat-share meeting and presented and explained the list to everyone and asked them what they thought of it and reiterated that it was just an idea and that they were welcome to make improvements. Everyone agreed that we could do it this way. Now we have been living with this system since the first of July and had to keep reminding Luca to enter his points, which he didn't do. Today he entered points for the first time and suddenly the whole system no longer suits him and he wants to change it, have something else, again.  He said where are we going and that we would introduce a social points system like in China.

He entered a lot of points today because he says he was constantly putting away dishes and doing the washing up last week. Tina and I have managed to record our points over the day that we have done something, which of course helps to show when a task was last done.

Update 1: He has registered a lot of points so I cleaned the fridge today to even things out a bit. It went as expected and we fought. Many things were said, the main points that came up were that he doesn't like the new vibes and doesn't understand why we now have a financial and task plan because we didn't have one before and he feels it goes against him personally. I said you feel stupid when you decide things and someone doesn't co-operate as agreed and I also said directly that I felt the work wasn't distributed fairly. The comparison with China's points system again, when I said it would also give us more transparency, which he didn't really address when I asked what was wrong with it if you can understand the division of labour. 

He mainly brought up the issue of us making decisions without him, which may be the case the first time, but Tina and I are really convinced that we talked about it. I said we all remember it differently so there's no point in talking about it, plus we scrapped the plan when he said he wouldn't go along with it, so I don't know what he wants.  

Which was too much for me in the end and I broke off the conversation when he said we should involve him more in the planning and I said we had done that together at the flat-share meeting and he said that was more a situation where he should say yes or no to the proposal. I said several times that it was just an idea and encouraged him to make counter-suggestions, the damn plan says ""feel free to make suggestions and improvements"". 

It can't be that Tina and I remember the situation completely differently again.

And the thing is, as much as he married again and had three more of us, he has been hung up on his wife the whole time, has been really toxic and unhealthy toward all of us and my mom has followed the toxic after him.

Some of the fucked up things my dad has done: Claimed all of us were the kids of his first wife, tried naming Lucy after his first wife as a junior, tried to make his former ILs play pretend with Nate, Lucy and me and called us their grandkids and them our grandkids. He has told me, Luce and Nate that he never loved our mom, that she's nothing compared to his first wife, he has talked about how sick it makes him feel when he looks at us and realizes we're someone else's kids. He has literally cried to us that we're so unfair existing as not her kids even though we didn't make ourselves.

I freely admit, I was a bit blind to the signs that Jake was infatuated with me. I thought he was a nice guy who was trying to make his gf’s chronically single friend feel included.

Unfortunately it was too late to do anything because Jake made a move on me less than a week after that conversation. It was actually fairly public so it wasn’t even me that had to be the one to tell Ally. 

Ally and I did talk about it, and I thought we were sticking together. She even came and stayed with me for three weeks after the break up. I did everything I could to support her. But after 4 months it never seems to be enough. She is constantly making comments about me - what I wear, how I act, everything I do just seems to annoy her. She keeps pointing out everything I do, saying “that” is what gives guys “the wrong idea”. She doesn’t seem to like going places with me anymore either. If we go out together she leaves early if I get male attention (which I don’t invite). I’ve taken her out for spa days, dinners, done everything I can to make her feel special but I’m sick of feeling like Hester Prynne.

This came to a head on Sunday when I went to Ally’s housewarming party. She greeted me, but I could see something was off so I just left her to it and talked to other people. While I was talking to one of her colleagues, Ally pulled me aside and asked me to change my outfit because it was drawing attention (spoiler: it was not). I refused to change into clothes she wanted to lend me so she said I had to leave, and that after what happened with Jake she thought I would try to be more conscious of how I am. 

I kind of lost it and told her she needs to stop punishing me for what Jake did, because I didn’t do anything. I reminded her that she didn’t see anything wrong either so it’s not like I was the only naive one and that she was the person who brought him into my life not the other way around. I said I was sick of her acting like she a victim of something I did and that she is being a brat. And then I left. 

My roommate feels I’m absolutely in the right and has been sick of how she treats me since she stayed with us. But I feel bad. The whole situation was fucked up and maybe I’m not giving Ally enough grace for feeling weird around me now. But at the same time, she could just take some space rather than being rude to me. Idk.

When Ally started dating her ex, “Jake”, I was really happy for her. Jake was fun, interesting, and he pulled Ally out of her shell which was nice to see. The three of us would do a lot together since Jake and I had similar interests. For a while we were a good trio.

I was recently approached by a friend of mine (32F) who is very well-read and has been working on a novel for a couple of years. She is planning to self-publish the novel through a self-publishing company. She, of course, had to pay them for editing, book design, etc. I have my own feelings about this, but it's not my place to share my opinion. Plenty of people self-publish because they don't want to go through the endless querying process. I don't blame them.

Anyway, this friend approached me and asked me to read the finalized version of her novel and write up a blurb for the back cover. I agreed because she's my friend. I also assumed that she is likely a good writer based on how well-read she is and the fact that she has been working on this novel for a couple of years. My creative writing students come to class with rough drafts that are more polished than her final draft.

I've started reading the novel, and it is objectively bad. The story itself (a romance) is intriguing, but the execution just isn't there at all. Now, I'm in a tough spot. I can't tell this friend that the story is bad and that I won't write a blurb and have my name attached to this book. That would be awful. I also feel bad that she paid over $4,000 to this company, and they obviously didn't provide much in terms of editing.

I would be happy to provide editing suggestions, but I also don't want to offer unless she asks. I'm not a genius writer or anything. However, I do have a few publications under my belt.

89,1dz4ven,AITAH? I (21f) have set very clear rules for my child and my mother(44f) continues to add her advice in; making me uncomfortable- after i asked it to stop- now i’m a narcissist. ,"So for everyone to have the best picture you can, i’m gonna give you a little bit about the history with my Mother.

 She’s been an alcoholic now for over 6 years. I’m talking the kind of drunk that doesn’t clean, gets confrontational, lost, needs extra help, and on top of all of that she’s bipolar. I was maybe 15/16 when she started leaving me for the summer to go stay with her estranged boyfriend(and this went on for weeks) all while justifying it by saying, “you were old enough to manage, you can cook, clean, etc. I thought you how.” She kept us away from our father -well tried too- and for years had my siblings and I confused he didn’t want us. That’s just a little of it, but just in case it gets seen by her I’ll spare the rest of the embarrassment. Just know, she hasn’t always been the best person to her children. 

I recently found out I was pregnant and hoping to make bonds better with family because it takes a village, my husband (25m) and I packed up our little 2bed house and drove 7hours in one day.
 It’s been rocky from the start, from not asking for any money to complaining that when we buy stuff that she has claim on it because it’s her house and she lets us stay for “Free.” Need to mention, my mothers house was CONDEMNABLE when we got here and the two of us (My husband and I) cleaned the house just in time for codes to inspect and the house to be cleared. Let’s just say, this house was a health concern before we moved in. Also she doesn’t clean, most of the upkeep in the house is decided to be us (once she gets drunk “her legs don’t work”) 
Anyways, she’s had some many inputs on how i’m raising my child when they’re not asked for and she’s not respecting any of my boundaries with my child. i say Gentle parenting, she hears “if he needs beat i’m beating him.” I can’t act like i didn’t yell but for the last couple of months i’ve been speaking and nobody seems to be listening other than about their feelings, and acting like i don’t know what’s good for my baby. so, AITAH? be brutal, honesty is good.

91,1dz4uxn,AITA For kicking out my best friend?,"Throwaway because my friend knows my Reddit. I’ll call my friend Angela for anonymity.

My (25F) best friend (24F) and I have been living together for the last year. At first it was great! We’ve known each other since we were 10 so we thought we would do well living together. We live in a small two bedroom apartment with my two cats, peaches and bowser, who are my whole world. They were a gift from my mom who passed two years ago.

I had been living in the apartment for a year before Angela asked to move in as she broke up with her boyfriend and didn’t have a place to stay. My last roommate had moved out a couple weeks prior and I was having a hard time paying bills so it was perfect! Angela was paying me her half of the rent every month and we took turns buying groceries. As she worked mainly from home and I worked in person, she offered to do most of the chores.

About 6-7 months in, she got a boyfriend (31M) who we’ll call Jared. They would sit on the couch all day and eat all the groceries. They’d leave chip bags and drink cans everywhere and expect me to clean it up. Jared convinced Angela that I was freeloading off her because I “expected her to clean the entire house” and she was basically my “housewife”.

She stopped buying groceries and soon stopped giving me rent money too and I was struggling to support us and her boyfriend. She refused to clean and constantly told me she’s not my “housewife” and I’m perfectly capable of cleaning my apartment.

The last straw was when I came home to my beautiful cats, peaches and bowser missing. I searched for them everywhere and I called into work the next day so that I could look around the neighborhood and I printed signs and put them up everywhere. I was crying all day and thinking that I had dishonored my mom’s memory by losing the most important gift she gave me. I came home that night defeated and exhausted and upset to Jared and Angela on my couch. Angela asked me what was wrong and I told her about my cats and asked her if she had seen them. She said they pooped on the floor of her room so she gave them to her sister. She complained that they were annoying and left hair everywhere and that she hated cats anyway and she did me a favor because now I didn’t have to worry about them while they was at work.

That’s when I lost it. I told her to get all of her stuff and leave my apartment. I told her I was going to spend the night at a hotel while she got all her things but I didn’t want her in my home anymore. She looked shocked and tried to object but I left and found a cheap hotel a block away at which is where I am now. She’s been blowing up my phone saying I’m a terrible person and I didn’t deserve the cats anyway.

93,1dz49zb,AITA for not inviting my husband’s friend’s wife,"There have been strong opinions regarding this situation, so I'm needing outside perspective to determine if IATA.

Recently a group of us went on a trip, fake names for clarity. The group consisted of my husband, Nathan (29M), myself (27F), my husband's best friend, Lenny (29M), Lenny's wife, Kassie(25F), and 2 of Lenny's male friends (22M and 31M).

Lenny and Nathan have been best friends since grade school and talk weekly. Kassie and myself are ""friends"" by association and talk maybe 1-2x per year. Not close, but we get along fine. The guys golfed every morning on the trip, leaving Kassie and I to entertain ourselves. We did brunch in the mornings and hung out by the pool in the afternoons. When asked if there was anything Kassie was interested in doing on the trip she said no, just wanting to enjoy the pool. Noted!

Events that led to my decision:
1) Minature golf was a scheduled group activity. Mind you it’s outdoors in Arizona in July. I said that I would not be participating due to having my baby and not wanting baby in the heat for hours. I went with the group to the mini golf location and mentioned I might pop over to Target next door for the AC until they were finished, then we would have dinner as planned. Kassie, who already paid for mini golf and was heading to the 1st hole overheard and said ""if you go, come find me and I can go too"". I'll admit that I was looking forward to just browsing and recharging my social battery with just my baby and I. After her comment, I decided not to go to Target. ***I realized Kassie is the person that will say yes to anything, even if she isn't truly interested***

2) After brunch on the morning of, I asked if she wanted to the mall, she said yes. We arrive and I notice she didn't look around, but instead hovered. I asked if she wanted to shop at any store in particular, she said no and continued to stand next to me while I browsed. I felt bad for suggesting this idea when she clearly wasn't into it, and we went home shortly after.

The AITA situation happened near the end of the trip. The group was lounging in the pool and I briefly mentioned that I wanted to go thrifting. My husband confirmed keeping the baby. While I was getting dressed he texted and asked if I invited her, I said “no, I kinda want time to myself” and that was it. I headed out and came back 2hrs later to an angry mob. Kassie made a comment about how she ""must have missed her invite"". I asked if she enjoyed thrifting, she said ""no, but I still would have gone"". I mentioned that I would have felt bad making her wait on me doing something that I enjoy, but she does not. She continued to push and was clearly offended, even announcing that she told Lenny “I’m getting more mad the longer she’s gone”. 
I'll admit that I purposely did not extend the invite given the recent mall experience and knowing she would have said ""yes"" to going thrifting.

To sum it up, I took heat from the group the rest of the evening about how I was wrong for not inviting her, and it wasn't about whether or not she enjoyed thrifting, it was the principle of not inviting her. My spouse said I should have let her know my plan, but informed her I want alone time. Could I have done this? Yes, but I didn’t feel the need to explain myself, and from what I know about Kassie I don’t think it would have been received well. 

So, AITA? 

***EDIT #1***

I appreciate the feedback! I’ve spent the last few days self-reflecting and trying to decide if I truly am an AH that lacked self awareness. 
I see several comments regarding my husband, so this is where he stands on the situation:
His defense is that he was loyal to the decision, not the person. He looked at it from a morally right v. wrong stance. I was upset with him for knowing I need “me” time after too much socialization, and not acknowledging it in front of his friends. He states it wasn’t fair for me to put him in a situation to defend me.

1) the trip was 4.5 days in Scottsdale, which nobody had been to before. It was unexplored territory for everyone
2) the guys had a tee time every morning and were home by 12-1p, so I spent every morning, 7a-12p, with Kassie and my baby
3) I spent 0 time by myself, EXCEPT for the 2hrs I left to go thrifting 
4) no other wives or babies were there
5) brunch in the morning was Kassie’s idea
6) when I pulled the irish goodbye, everybody was in the pool, including Kassie. It wasn’t like I left her stranded with no car and no company

***Edit #3***

When I say I returned to an angry mob and took heat from the group, this is how it went down. I returned to the bnb, left my shopping bag in the car, walked out onto the pool deck to a slow clap from the group with comments such as “welcome back”, “how was thrifting”, “must have missed my invite”, “did you get anything good”, “Kassie was not very happy”, “I was getting more mad by the minute”, “you didn’t even tell me you were leaving” etc. Everyone was still outside in the pool/on the pool deck where I left them 2 hrs prior",Not the A-hole,2024-07-09,"AITA for not inviting my husband’s friend’s wife There have been strong opinions regarding this situation, so I'm needing outside perspective to determine if IATA.

Recently a group of us went on a trip, fake names for clarity. The group consisted of my husband, Nathan (29M), myself (27F), my husband's best friend, Lenny (29M), Lenny's wife, Kassie(25F), and 2 of Lenny's male friends (22M and 31M).

Lenny and Nathan have been best friends since grade school and talk weekly. Kassie and myself are ""friends"" by association and talk maybe 1-2x per year. Not close, but we get along fine. The guys golfed every morning on the trip, leaving Kassie and I to entertain ourselves. We did brunch in the mornings and hung out by the pool in the afternoons. When asked if there was anything Kassie was interested in doing on the trip she said no, just wanting to enjoy the pool. Noted!

Events that led to my decision:
1) Minature golf was a scheduled group activity. Mind you it’s outdoors in Arizona in July. I said that I would not be participating due to having my baby and not wanting baby in the heat for hours. I went with the group to the mini golf location and mentioned I might pop over to Target next door for the AC until they were finished, then we would have dinner as planned. Kassie, who already paid for mini golf and was heading to the 1st hole overheard and said ""if you go, come find me and I can go too"". I'll admit that I was looking forward to just browsing and recharging my social battery with just my baby and I. After her comment, I decided not to go to Target. ***I realized Kassie is the person that will say yes to anything, even if she isn't truly interested***

Hello everyone I really just need advice over here 

I 26f have this friend 27f we have been friends since we were 15 years old, I always thought we were close and had each others back but now I’m not sure. 


Okay so to add some background information this friend and I have different opinions on things which is fine but when someone does something I don’t like or hurts me I get emotional due to my neurodivergence and not being able to regulate my emotions sometimes and like everyone I say things I don’t mean. 
 My last post about my bestfriend of 17 years is connected to this  that friend let’s call her Mary and I got in this big fight and ended our friendship  in anger I said I hope you fall in the lake that was it. 

Now my friend since I was 15 let’s call her Jo decided to take i upon herself to still hangout with Mary and “try to talk to her for me” but didn’t tell me and tried to hide it from me I only found out on Snapchat. I got upset and asked her why she would still hang out with Mary after everything that had happened. 

Now I may be the asshole here because I went and removed Jo off of all of my stuff after seeing the story and just let it be. Jo decides to message me this long message saying how hurt SHE was that I removed her and “I didn’t realize you were this hurt” and then she goes on to say she’s disappointed at the recording she heard from Mary and her boyfriend of our PRIVATE conversation.. am I the asshole for removing Jo off everything with no real explanation and washing my hands of her? She’s done this before she’s allowed the person who  fucked a guy I liked in my  bed to hangout and come over she let someone who choked me out move in and live with her for a few months… I don’t know why I didn’t end the friendship forever ago. She’s always disregarded how I have felt and has pushed for other things like me getting back with my abusive ex. I just need some outsider advice 


Edit to add: Jo messaged me this long ass message telling me how I needed to grow up and stop being dramatic and told me  she was never a bad friend so
I’m going to add another example when we lived together after I got out of an abusive relationship another person in the house kicked me out for being a day late on bills(my check was short I gave them what  I could afford so I could also pay my phone bill) and they told me I had ten days to pack up my stuff when I went the next day to get all of my belongings everything of value of mine was stolen out of my room including my tv I had just got for Christmas, my brand new winter coat I got for Christmas and brand new clothes body lotions and UNDERWEAR. To this day jo refuses to admit that she helped her friends take all of my things of value and pawn them or take them for themselves. she’s allowed people to disrespect me time and time again.

We've done some excusursions during the day and have been getting back at night when her parking garage is getting full. My sister in law has been driving and she struggles to park in these spaces. I will acknowledge that the spaces are tight, but it's still doable. She was meandering around through the 1st floor garage getting frustrated after attempting to park at a spot only to low key panic and pull out in search for a better one. 

Finally, (second night in a row), she gets frazzled and asks us to get out of the car because it's too much pressure to try to park with everyone in the car. At this point, we're all the way in the back of the garage and she lives towards the front, maybe 50 to 75 yards away. She gives us directions for getting back and just as someone is about to open the door, I inquire if we can be dropped off closer to her apartment. She explains the directions again and gestures to the mail room door that we have to take to get to the first floor. ""Yeah but then we have to walk all the way back that way to get to your apartment"", I say. She gets real mad and says, ""Okay, fine!"", and starts driving fast through the parking lot to the door closest to her apartment. She begins mocking me to wanting ""door to door service."" I didn't argue or say anything else. We also had bags in the car so we grabbed all our stuff and walked up to the apartment. 

I figured if you're going to kick people out of the car prematurely, you may as well bring them close to the destination. Especially since it was the result of her own discomfort parking her car. But maybe I'm just an AH?

99,1dz3rb0,AITA for telling my mother to stop trash talking my father and his family? ,"My parents had an awful marriage and an acrimonious, explosive divorce. They have been separated since I was 14 years old, and divorced since I was 16. I’m 31 now, and my mother continually talks badly about my father, and his family—seeking any opportunity to bring them up, inquire about them after visits, roll her eyes at their oddities, and remark on what a mess/narcissist/awful person my father is. On vacations with her side of the family, her mother and sisters also chime in with their own vitriol—a kind of toxicity that an ex of mine frequently commented on. 

Granted, I don’t have any relationship with my father—he’s a mentally ill, abusive, homophobic mess. He was a horrific husband and father, and has put all of us through hell. And yet—he’s still one half of me, and his family—while deeply complicated—are mine, too. My sisters are incredibly bothered by my mom’s behavior-in some ways, it feels like she gets pleasure from hearing about what a mess the family is, and finds joy in talking about how horrible my father is. While my mother has never gone to therapy or dated since the divorce, her life is beautiful and filled with joy—but she can’t seem to leave this part of the past behind, no matter how much space we’ve given her to speak about it over nearly two decades.

I’m staying with my mother to help her with a project for the week, and she’s already brought my father and his family up multiple times. Last night she went in on them again after I told her how nice my uncle had been to me on a recent visit. I tried for a while to deflect her comments and change the conversation—but she kept coming back to talking about how awful they were. I finally snapped, and expressed that while my sisters and I have to be tied to him and his family forever, she’s free of—and should make use of that freedom. She of course reacted really defensively and, said she never talks badly about him. I tried for a while to provide concrete examples of times when this had happened, but she denied everything and began rolling her eyes at me—at which point I finally stood up to go upstairs before I said anything I would regret. She called after me that that was my MO. I went upstairs and went to bed—we haven’t spoken since. I have to work very closely with her all week, and I’m dreading it. 

I really feel like I’ve had it with this behavior. I feel the exact same way that my mom does about these people, but I’m trying hard to move on, break cycles, and not let my life be defined by their dysfunction. At the same time, I know my mom suffered enormous pain because of my father—and she’s just looking for a place to talk about it. I probably could have held my tongue and not said anything. 

AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-09,"AITA for telling my mother to stop trash talking my father and his family?  My parents had an awful marriage and an acrimonious, explosive divorce. They have been separated since I was 14 years old, and divorced since I was 16. I’m 31 now, and my mother continually talks badly about my father, and his family—seeking any opportunity to bring them up, inquire about them after visits, roll her eyes at their oddities, and remark on what a mess/narcissist/awful person my father is. On vacations with her side of the family, her mother and sisters also chime in with their own vitriol—a kind of toxicity that an ex of mine frequently commented on. 

Granted, I don’t have any relationship with my father—he’s a mentally ill, abusive, homophobic mess. He was a horrific husband and father, and has put all of us through hell. And yet—he’s still one half of me, and his family—while deeply complicated—are mine, too. My sisters are incredibly bothered by my mom’s behavior-in some ways, it feels like she gets pleasure from hearing about what a mess the family is, and finds joy in talking about how horrible my father is. While my mother has never gone to therapy or dated since the divorce, her life is beautiful and filled with joy—but she can’t seem to leave this part of the past behind, no matter how much space we’ve given her to speak about it over nearly two decades.

I’m staying with my mother to help her with a project for the week, and she’s already brought my father and his family up multiple times. Last night she went in on them again after I told her how nice my uncle had been to me on a recent visit. I tried for a while to deflect her comments and change the conversation—but she kept coming back to talking about how awful they were. I finally snapped, and expressed that while my sisters and I have to be tied to him and his family forever, she’s free of—and should make use of that freedom. She of course reacted really defensively and, said she never talks badly about him.

100,1dz3gkb,AITA for potentially getting my roommate in trouble?,"So I (M21) have a roommate “Jim” (M20). We're not best friends or anything, but we've gotten along pretty great up until this point. Day before yesterday, in the wee hours I was up studying for an important test that's coming up. Jim comes in and starts complaining about the lights being on, he has a headache. I thought he was drunk, slurring his words and carrying on. 

I told him it's not my problem he's been partying all night and that I really need to study (these summer courses are critical for my GPA); I can turn the lights down but I'm not turning them off. It's cool for a little while but then he starts begging for the lights to be completely off, says he's not feeling well, so I tell him I just need fifteen minutes and could he hang out in the lounge or somewhere else until then? 

Well he gets up and almost instantly gets sick on the floor. Now I'll admit, I was extra pissed because it got on some of my clothes, I started yelling at him to pick it up immediately or I'm calling the RA. He does, but then get this, while he's on the floor cleaning he pukes AGAIN.

So I just call the RA, told them what I thought happened (that he got drunk and started throwing up) and left.

The next day Jim's extremely mad at me for calling the RA because he might be facing disciplinary action. He claims he wasn't drunk and that he just had a bad headache. I told him I reasonably assumed he was drunk based on his other un-headache-related behavior (slurring, difficulty talking, stumbling, etc.), and I had to call the RA because of the vomit.

I do realize that I might have jumped the gun saying he was drunk, but it was a logical assumption and I was probably right despite his denials now.

103,1dz389i,AITA for telling partner not to go on holiday with drug addicted friend ,"my partner is going away with her friend next month for about a week and I am worried she will relapse. 

Background info: has a history of drug abuse and the friend is aware. since moving here with her but in a different city, the friend has been doing a lot of clubbing, unprotected sex with random men (he is riddled with STIs on the regular), and does a metric fuck load of MDMA. the friend is aware i dont tolerate drug use due to childhood events / family stuff and so is my partner. 

Current: they went to a concert a few months ago and he pressured her into doing MDMA when she initially said no. Obviously not his fault 100% since she caved, but he made it awkward when she said no and would not have asked her if I was there. This had been the only time they’ve hung out without me in months and he saw the opportunity to get her back into it. I found out and she told me what had happened. I told her I will not tolerate drug use when she already has issues with smoking weed too much & it ruins our time spent together since I can’t stand her breath after it & she shuts off mentally.

They are going to a concert in another country in about a month for 5 days and I am terrified they will do drugs again since he always finds a plug wherever he travels to and is out clubbing and with random men every night he is usually away. I don’t want to be the asshole for telling her not to go, but I am 100% not comfortable with them going on holiday together because I know they will get up to it.

tldr: partner (who has drug addiction history and recently got sober in the last year) has a best friend who pressured her to do drugs- they go on holiday next month and i want to tell her to not go due to fear of them doing drugs more since he is always on mdma and needs to party all the time.

A little warning: this post is DEFINITELY not as important as most other ones on here, but I do need opinions.

I, (16F), have this ""friend"", Lily, 16F. Lily is the pure definition of a pick me. She constantly pretends to be bad things, flirts with guys to get their attention, etc. She also tends to reject guys when they ask her out after flirting with them. It doesn't help that she has an hourglass body shape and a charming fucking personality. Most teenage girls will know exactly what kind of girl I'm talking about.

Not only that, but she constantly lies and gaslights all her friends, turning them against each other. I hate to admit it, but it took me around a year to realize what she was doing, mostly because of her charm, like I've mentioned. Me and a few other people that she's used have been collecting evidence, and we intend to confront her soon.

Anyways, today she tried to feed me another piece of garbage about how another one of my friends has been gossiping about me (I know they haven't). I was having a bad day and told her that I didn't want to listen to her bullshit anymore and told her that she was a narcissistic bitch who needs to fuck off and find other people to manipulate. I then walked away, and she started crying, although I think she's fine because she has a crap ton of friends that came to comfort her right away anyways.

This was around a month ago (it's summer break right now). This happened around a week before the end of school, and she didn't show up for that whole week. I now kinda feel bad.

My family do not know I am a lesbian and I doubt I’d ever tell them. I have 4 siblings, all in their 20’s. We all live at home with our mom. All 4 of my siblings wish to get married, move out, have children and live their own lives. I do not want to marry, nor have children but I do want to move out.

Around 2 years back, I lost my 50-year-old dad. He was a severely ill man with a number of health complications. My mom was his primary carer and me and my siblings would assist with all types of care. We did not have a normal childhood – I could say we spent most of our lives in hospitals and medical centres, taking care of our dad in ways that normal children did not do. Despite all of this, my parents tried hard to make our lives as enjoyable as possible, and I will always be grateful for that. Though taking care of him made me more empathetic as a child, and then adult, it was hard balancing life when I would priortise my father and his health over everything. It was rough watching my dad slowly die and his body give up over time.

After his death, my mom became severely dependant on us for company. She spent 30 years attached to my dad so this was understandable. She doesn’t have many friends as she spent most of her time taking care of my dad so the opportunity to make friends never came around. Her family live in a different country, and her in laws come over occasionally but their entire relationship is on the surface. Me and my siblings are constantly by her side. She breaks down a lot, doesn’t sleep much and has been having issues with her health

A few weeks back, the conversation about marriage and children came up whilst I was with my siblings. All of them spoke about how they aim to eventually leave home, get married and have children. I made it clear that I do not want to get married (I would be expected to marry a muslim man, however im a closeted lesbian, so I just tell my family that I don’t want to get married at all), but I do want to move out and get a place of my own. All of them were baffled at my ‘selfishness’. To them, I can only move out if I want to get married and have children, otherwise I should stay with our mom and give her company as she would not survive being on her own. I bought this up with my mom and she agreed with them. Since then, I’ve repeatedly mentioned that I want to move out, have my own place and travel, however im constantly shot down and called selfish. It has been playing on my mind a lot and I cant help but get upset.

I feel guilty. How can I wish to leave her alone when I don’t have to? When I could make her less lonely and give her some company and bring her ease? I spent years taking care of my dad and I cant even live with my mom and take care of her?

I have this friend, let’s name her Ashley, who is somewhat obsessive about my life. She wants to know every detailed about my life and my past. She needs to know who I’m friends with and who I am with if I go out. I’ve only known her for a couple years but we became really close. I don’t like to talk about my personal life because of another friend who accused my family of horrific things after we stopped being friends. 

A little while ago, I told her my brother’s name after she insisted. Just half an hour later, she texts me ALL of his socials. I was really uncomfortable but texted “that’s so weird, can you not 😅”. 

Later that week we were on FaceTime and she starts screen sharing. Ashley had looked up me and my brother (first and last name) and was asking if the things that came up were true, when we did them, and just specific questions regarding the stuff that came up (there was a lot that came up). 

This is when I kind of put my foot down and was like okay this is so weird, I feel like you’re stalking us at this point. She just laughed and said she just wanted to know more about us because me and my brother have a close relationship.

The last couple weeks we were distant. I was going a lot out with other friends for their bdays (she was not invited). 

Couple days ago, I reached out to Ashley and another friend Jake just for fun. Neither responded. I told Ashley we were being distant and if everything was okay. I removed her from my insta and said I didn’t like her questioning who the people I follow are and that’s why I did that. 

She said I was degrading her and accusing her of crimes. She said I was a liar and treated her unfairly. I asked for examples to which she didn’t reply. I sent another message pointing out everything she did wrong like googling my family, making no effort to make plans but getting mad at ME when we don’t hang out, me protecting her against people while she’s friends with people who have hurt me time and time again, how rude it is to ask why I have other friends when I have her. 

she said “too bad we don’t see eye to eye, I think we should end this friendship.” I replied this morning saying “I’m okay with that. I’m still not sure how finding one’s siblings social media (not just insta) as well as googling them to know more about them is okay but like said we certainly do have different morals!”

I don’t know if my last message was the best thing to say because it sounds passive aggressive and was just generally rude but she still thinks what she has done is okay and I’m being dramatic. Ashley and Jake have both blocked me on everything, but Ashley still has me unblocked on messages. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong fully but AITA?

I work at a summer camp and during morning drop off there are 2 positions, runner and greeter. Greeter takes the kids out of the car and doesn’t really do a lot of walking, runner however takes the kid from the greeter and brings them all the way (around 1 ½ blocks) to the check in tent where they then leave and do it all over again. Usually I am a runner and have no problem with it, but today my knee was hurting. For context I did gymnastics when I was younger (I quit at age 15 I’m now 17) and since then I’ve had knee issues, sometimes I have to wear a brace because it gets bad. 

There are 5 greeters and all of them have been greeters since day 1 of work. And so when I decided to be a greeter today (I checked in with my supervisor who said it was fine, as there are no assigned spots) the person whos spot I took (J) got mad and said “ive been here since the start, u need to go be a runner. I’m not being kicked out of my spot”. I then explained to her about my knee and she just kinda shrugged and turned away. I just stayed there because I already had gotten permission. 
 
Since there were 6 greeters my supervisor noticed and came over. She told (J) that she needed her to be a runner. (J) reluctantly agreed and left to go do the other job.  After that I started getting looks from the other 4 greeters.

I do feel bad about taking her spot, but my knee was really hurting this morning. I feel as though I did nothing wrong in this situation but it’s my first job and I don’t want any conflict.
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-09,"AITA for “stealing” my coworkers spot 
I work at a summer camp and during morning drop off there are 2 positions, runner and greeter. Greeter takes the kids out of the car and doesn’t really do a lot of walking, runner however takes the kid from the greeter and brings them all the way (around 1 ½ blocks) to the check in tent where they then leave and do it all over again. Usually I am a runner and have no problem with it, but today my knee was hurting.

108,1dz2g83,"AITA for ""abandoning"" my friends on a trip?","Me and a group of guys who I share a university class with decided to plan a trip since we were all bored. We thought it'd be fun (and cheap) to take the ferry to the neighboring country and stay there for a week. There are 15 of us, and while not everyone knows everyone that well, we've formed this odd loose friend group held together by a chain of who's close friends with who; it's usually an ""anybody up for drinks?"" and then whoever comes, comes sort of situation. 

The dock is on the other side of the city, and since none of us have cars because we're all broke as shit, we thought the easiest way to go would be to take the metro to the centre together a couple hours prior, split up and grab lunch or whatever there and then get to the terminal at our own pace.
We even met up in person before leaving to go over the meeting times.

When we all went our separate ways, I went off with one of the guys I'm close friends with (I'll call him ""Frank""). We had around 3 hours to get there, so we just hung out for a bit and got some food before hopping on a bus. We were there about 30 mins before the agreed time, and bought tickets for the ship that left 30 minutes after the meet up time. 40 minutes went by, and no one had arrived. We messaged the rest of the group asking where they were, and turns out all of these people have 0 attention span.

A few people lost track of time while eating, some went to a bar, one decided to go buy a suit (???), another thought this was a great time to sort out something at the bank (????). Some did actually try to come on time, but one guy refused to take a bus and two others didn't want to pay for a taxi. 

10 minutes before the ship took off, we decided to just get on it without the rest and meet them at the destination since the ride was only 2,5 hours or so. This seemed like the reasonable thing to do since we couldn't refund the tickets, and it was just the boat ride anyway. However, when one of the guys I do know pretty well (I'll call him ""Frank2"") found out we had left, he got really pissed.

He said we shouldn't have bought tickets before the rest of them arrived, and asked why we even came on the trip if we didn't want to hang out with anyone else. I replied that I did want to do the trip together, but how was I supposed to know that everyone else had no time management skills. He said that we never agreed when we would leave, only when we would arrive at the terminal, and that we should've waited. He said he would've wanted to grab drinks and such with us on the boat. I thought the plan was clear and it would’ve been odd to not assume we were leaving at that time, but Frank2 thinks I need to relax. Frank thinks we did the reasonable thing, but two others I spoke to agree with Frank2. 

It all worked out and we reunited, but Frank2 is still clearly pissed and the whole vibe is a little off. I really didn't think it was a big deal, but everyone seems genuinely offended.

I called my mom weekly, sending photos/videos of my kids almost daily while her efforts to reach out to me were very limited. 

We’ve extended many invites for my parents to go places/get away with us and they’ve been declined because they were busy taking care of something for someone.

So I've been noticing that the picture seems to keep getting darker and darker until the screen is nearly invisible in the daytime. I am generally pretty good at electronics, mechanics, all that kinda stuff. I'm the guy people call when they need tech support. But this damn TV is ludicrously convoluted in the amount of menus it has. I swear there's multiple menus that deal with picture quality.

After messing around in the menus for like a week, I say screw it, and reset the TV back to factory. Another 3 hours to set it up this time. My picture is back to perfect.

2 days ago, I'm walking through the living room, and I see my daughter (17f) diving into the picture menus. I ask her if she has been changing the settings, she says yes, because she feels the TV is too bright when she's watching it at night with all the lights off. I ask her to not change the settings, and explain the issues I've been having with it. She asks if we can ""share"" the settings, by way of me turning it up when I want, and she can turn it down when she wants. The last thing I want to do is mess around with the picture menus every time I turn on the TV, so I ask her to just leave the settings alone, or watch the TV with a light on, so it's not as blaringly light. She melts down at this point. ""Why can't we share it? I don't like having the light on at night. You're being greedy and acting like a dictator."" My wife apparently agrees with her, told me I'm being too obstinate. I truly did not think I was being out of line for telling the daughter that I really don't want her messing with the settings, because I don't want to go through the whole setup crap again if she messes it up and can't fix it.

AITA here?

EDIT: She has her own TV in her own room she can do whatever she likes to it.

She was told that if she changed the settings back after she used it she could do whatever she liked. she looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""we both know I'm not going to do that.""

My issue is not whether or not I can ""figure out"" my TV. My issue is that I feel I should not have to change the settings every time I turn on the TV.

117,1dyz3he,AITA for calling out my mom for not defending me against her fat-shaming relatives? ,"
I (30F) recently gave birth to a baby girl in April. Even pre-pregnancy I was slightly overweight (for my 175 cms height 168 pounds is the maximum weight I can be for a normal BMI) but my pre-pregnancy weight was 175 pounds. At the 40th week of my pregnancy, I was at 189 pounds. However after birth I lost about 20 pounds. 

For a month and a half I had little to no milk supply, So I purposely ate foods which I knew would increase milk supply and now after 3 months postpartum I am currently at 183 pounds.

My mom's brother and his wife visited us last weekend and the previous night I had just 2 hours of sleep and so I was sleeping alongside baby in the morning around 11:30 am. My mom's SIL (45F) barges in my bedroom, wakes me up & she was like, oh god, you have gained so much weight, your cheeks have gotten so fat.Then she left the room and went to the kitchen and told my mom, 'Tell your daughter not to just keep eating and sleeping. She has just packed on pounds like hell.'

And my SIL was fatshaming my mom too as if she's just sitting simply at home. My mom is at her menopausal stage and also eating a shit ton of medicines (she broke her leg in April) for her leg fracture as well as high BP and my mom just takes it like she takes abuse from my dad. 

Then we go into the room where my mom's brother & SIL are and my mom says to her SIL that I was upset about what she said. To which my SIL replies that she did say what the truth was, i should start exercising and my uncle agrees with her and shames me further. My mom smiles and laughs with them. They proceed to call my baby a troublemaker (3 months old baby) and I call them out and they berate me for not being able to take a joke. 

The next day I asked my mom when are you gonna start defending me? Like 4  years ago, I had left my job due to COVID-19 as I was in a different country and borders closed for more than a year and I was infected & people were dying & my parents wanted me to come home and get well. But then they forced me to do trivial jobs in their businesses and no matter how much I tried I couldn't get out until I got married. We went to a family function back then and a gang of elderly relatives who didn't know the situation were making fun of me for not doing anything useful with my life. My mom just stands there not speaking up for me when she very well knows I'm the one paying for the household stuff and their living expenses from my savings from my job. I spent my entire savings on them. 

I asked her why won't you ever stand up for me and she says that 'I see nothing wrong with what people said to you in both situations. I fear for the people who have to look at you right now for how much you have gained. And she starts to shout at me that I'm being a terrible mother by not concentrating on raising my daughter and overthinking things when I'm in the wrong. AITA?

The three of us were all in an instagram groupchat along with her boyfriend's brother. Her boyfriend constantly sent ""edgy"" memes, rage-bait, and cringe-bait, all of which I could deal with easily. The posts themselves weren't an issue to me, but what he was saying about them became problematic in my eyes.

 He started sending more and more cringe-bait content centered around lesbian women. All three of us are bisexual, and he is well aware of my sister and I's sexuality. The butch lesbian cringe-bait content he sent in the groupchat was fine, some of it was even funny. However, what was NOT funny were his reactions to the posts he was sending in the groupchat. The specific instance that sent me over the edge was a completely normal post made by a plus-sized butch lesbian. She was basically doing a casual date night outfit check as a plus-sized, butch lesbian. It wasn't cringe-bait, it wasn't rage bait. It was literally just innocent instagram content. When he sent this post to the groupchat he sent it along with puking emojis, laughing emojis, etc etc. I responded to his message saying he's just being homophobic at this point. My sister responded saying ""She ate idc"" as in 'her outfit looks good and she's just doing her thing.' My sister's boyfriend then saw the opportunity to make a comment on the woman's weight and said something along the lines of ""yeah, she ATE."" 

This is what sent me over the edge. My sister's boyfriend is by no means the picture of health and fitness. He himself would likely be considered plus-sized, and has been much heavier in his life than he even is now. The woman in the video was referring to herself as plus-sized already, but she was nowhere near obese or problematically overweight. Her body looked like any other average, relatively overweight american's body. Her body looked like my sister's boyfriend's body. When I say this, I'm not joking. At all. Their bodies looked nearly identical. This, along with the fact that he was finding any excuse to make fun of some random innocent queer woman TO TWO QUEER WOMEN, pushed me past my breaking point. So I told him something along the lines of ""how are you going to say something like this when I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between you if yall were turned around.""

Needless to say, this didn't go over well. He then went on to attack me for the shape of my body and for my appearance, NEITHER of which are things I did to him. In my eyes, I never body-shamed him. I never said he was fat, or criticized his body in any way. What I did was point out to him that he's making fun of someone that's in the same boat he is.

123,1dyxpzp,AITA for refusing to spend Christmas with my dad's new family?,"I (21F) have recently started getting into  quite a fights with my brother (19M), sister (25F) and my dad (50M). They all Centre around my dad's girlfriend and her 2 kids, (14M and 16F).

My dad's girlfriend (let's call her Stacy) and my dad have been dating for about 3 years now and they're in it for the long haul. The first Christmas we spent with Stacy and her kids was at her ex-mother-in-laws house. I had 3 panic attacks the two days before Christmas day. So when I woke up Christmas morning and everyone was getting ready for church, I packed my bags and called my stepdad. I asked him if I could come home and he told me to drive safely and share my location. He then gave me gasmoney and money to stop for snacks on the road. So I got in the car without a word and drove the 6 hours home.

Keep in mind that Stacy is quite literally the reason that I started therapy 6 months before this.

Fast forward to this year, my dad has started talking about doing the same thing this year. I flat out refused. When asked why I started laughing and left the room. It's been brought up a few more times and everyone just seems to forget what happened last time. Now I'm starting to fight with everyone about Christmas (my absolute favourite time of the year). I don't want to spend another Christmas driving for 6 hours and I don't want to spend the days leading up to it in the same mindset. I've told my dad this much but my siblings keep telling me that I'm being selfish and to think about how this will look and to think about how Stacy and her kids will feel if I ruin another Christmas.

I really need help. Should I agree to spend Christmas with them or keep on refusing?

[EDIT] thank you everyone for the feedback to far. I saw a few comments asking for more context and asking about Stacy and my panic attacks. I'm sorry, but this is a long one because I want to give as much context as possible.

Let's start with Stacy. When we first met I liked her and she liked me (I thought at least). I was just turning 19 at this point and it was right before I started at University. For those a bit confused, in my country, University starts in February and runs through to November. In the June holiday (a month for us) we went on a family vacation. It became apparent that Stacy doesn't like me, or my siblings, but she has a special dislike for me. We were raised with liberal parents where we when we asked if we could do something the only rule was ""as long as the hospital, school, police and morgue don't call, do whatever you want."" This doesn't mean be an asshole or be irresponsible. We were simply taught to be independent, which I guess comes with divorced parents. Because we're well mannered children. We value our education, we participate in sports and appreciate culture. With that, we're pretty free kids (I say kids but we're all adults). This came to a clash on holiday when she realised that we were so independent that she couldn't control us. We knew how to help in the kitchen, to make our rooms tidy, make our beds each morning, make coffee for everyone. She still chose out her kids (12 and 14 at the time) clothes for the day and neither knew how to use a kettle.

With that said, not my circus, not my monkeys. I don't care how she raises her kids. My problem started when I was doing the dishes one night and she pushed (yes) me out of the way and told me that I should go be a kid and not do all the chores. I remember making a joke along the line of ""well, that's the plight of a child. To be their parent's slave"". I meant this as a joke, but it clearly didn't land because she started screaming and  scolded me and I tried to explain that it was a joke and I was only helping by doing the dishes.

This became an enduring problem for me and my siblings where we do chores or offer help (as any decent child does) and get scolded. I've spoken to my siblings and we've come to the agreement that she tries to treat us the way you would children her own kids' ages. I don't hold it against her. She hasn't dealt with having children that are adults and it's not on her. But we've spoken to her about this and she made it our fault by saying that we were over reacting and being disrespectful.

TMI but I've had depression since I was young and even had suicide attempts. The last was when I was 14 and since then I've been doing great. I stopped therapy because I felt like I was in a mental space where I didn't need it. I had things to Centre me, I had a support system. So when we got back from the vacation I was in a headspace I knew all to well and it was one I knew wouldn't end well. I made the decision to go back and it's been going great. I just feel that my therapist will always choose my side that's why I'm here asking if I'm the asshole.

On to Christmas and the panic attacks. I want to first add on that I don't have a clue why we're making Christmas plans in July. I'm asking the same question.

Dor the MIL issue. It wasn't her mother. It was the mother of her deceased husband. So why was I there? Why were we there when she is quite literally nothing to us. It felt weird. I've had a few panic attacks before, so when it started I excused myself. The first happened when we were in the living room and I'm not sure what we were discussing but I remember everything suddenly being so loud that I couldn't hear, my heart in my throat, my mind fuzzing over. The second happened the night of the 24th around the Christmas tree. We were talking about birthdays since mine was coming up. Since my parents divorced it has been tradition for my dad to take us for breakfast on our birthday and on big occasions like graduations. My dad skipped my birthday breakfast that year because Stacy asked him to come to their holiday home (but not us). I officially graduated high school (which runs January to December but in you final year you only get your marks the next January) shortly after my birthday. So he missed by 19th birthday and graduation because she asked him to which still stings 3 years later. This Christmas he casually mentioned the dates that they'll be going away again (us not being invited) and the dates fell nicely around my birthday. I mentioned this and everyone just went ""oh, he'll make it up to you."" The anger and frustration and being let down triggered the second one. The third one came on while I was in bed just replaying everything in my mind.

The driving off is not my way of dealing with things. I prefer to talk things through or come to an agreement to take a day to reevaluate and then come together again. But Christmas is my absolute favourite time of year. I'm one of those people who watch a Hallmark movie every day, sings Christmas songs starting in November, and go crazy with decorations and gifts. But waking up Christmas day I had that same feeling that I went to therapy for. I probably wasn't in the best mindset to drive, but I didn't know what else to do. When I got to my mom and stepdad I sent a text on the family group with my dad that I was sorry, but I couldn't be there and had to leave. I was sorry for being selfish but once they were home we could talk again.

I explained that I was uncomfortable and all my reasons, but I was still labeled selfish. My reasons involved, I clearly wasn't a thought since all my special days were missed. No one cared to even adress it. I didn't feel comfortable in a woman who I had no relation to's house and my dad's girlfriend clearly didn't make it a secret that she dislikes me. If you your wondering, yeah, my dad missed my 21st birthday for the same reasons as the other's too.

I've reiterated my reasons in the past few weeks but I'm still being told that I'm ruining everyone's Christmas plans and I'm feeling guilty for disappointing my siblings and my dad.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-09,"AITA for refusing to spend Christmas with my dad's new family? I (21F) have recently started getting into  quite a fights with my brother (19M), sister (25F) and my dad (50M). They all Centre around my dad's girlfriend and her 2 kids, (14M and 16F).

My dad's girlfriend (let's call her Stacy) and my dad have been dating for about 3 years now and they're in it for the long haul. The first Christmas we spent with Stacy and her kids was at her ex-mother-in-laws house. I had 3 panic attacks the two days before Christmas day. So when I woke up Christmas morning and everyone was getting ready for church, I packed my bags and called my stepdad. I asked him if I could come home and he told me to drive safely and share my location. He then gave me gasmoney and money to stop for snacks on the road. So I got in the car without a word and drove the 6 hours home.

Keep in mind that Stacy is quite literally the reason that I started therapy 6 months before this.

Fast forward to this year, my dad has started talking about doing the same thing this year. I flat out refused. When asked why I started laughing and left the room. It's been brought up a few more times and everyone just seems to forget what happened last time. Now I'm starting to fight with everyone about Christmas (my absolute favourite time of the year). I don't want to spend another Christmas driving for 6 hours and I don't want to spend the days leading up to it in the same mindset. I've told my dad this much but my siblings keep telling me that I'm being selfish and to think about how this will look and to think about how Stacy and her kids will feel if I ruin another Christmas.

I really need help. Should I agree to spend Christmas with them or keep on refusing?

[EDIT] thank you everyone for the feedback to far. I saw a few comments asking for more context and asking about Stacy and my panic attacks. I'm sorry, but this is a long one because I want to give as much context as possible.

Let's start with Stacy. When we first met I liked her and she liked me (I thought at least). I was just turning 19 at this point and it was right before I started at University. For those a bit confused, in my country, University starts in February and runs through to November. In the June holiday (a month for us) we went on a family vacation. It became apparent that Stacy doesn't like me, or my siblings, but she has a special dislike for me. We were raised with liberal parents where we when we asked if we could do something the only rule was ""as long as the hospital, school, police and morgue don't call, do whatever you want.""

124,1dyxkgj,AITA for not making a name art piece for my future nieces nursery when my sister asked even though I made one for my son?,"I (27m) am about to become a dad. My wife Ellie (26f) is pregnant and our son is due in August. Ellie has always been really supportive of my art, something my family never was, including my sister Rebecca (32f). Rebecca is expecting a baby girl in October. Ellie and I had talked about me designing something decorative for our son's nursery and when we chose the name and talked about wanting his name in the room, I thought up something I could design and paint and would fit nicely. It took me a few weeks to finish because it's big and detailed. But we love it. Ellie thinks it's extra sweet because I made it for our son instead of us buying something.

During our baby shower (we did a co-ed baby shower) we showed off the nursery and the art piece to some friends and family. Rebecca was among them. She was extremely jealous and asked me why I never offered to make one for her daughter as well. I brought up the fact Rebecca has always been so unsupportive of my art, the fact she always said it was a girly hobby or a gay boy's hobby and always backed our parents and other siblings in shitting all over my interest in drawing and painting.

She told me then she wanted me to make one and asked what she'd need to get for me to do it. I told her I wasn't going to make it for her. She decided to buy art supplies and ask for it again anyway and I still said no. I refused to take the art supplies. She left them in my house and I promptly left them back in hers. I told her she was being too pushy about it and should consider how she treats me before asking for something so time consuming to be done.

She told me I could do it for my niece and accused me of caring more for boys than I do girls, of thinking girls aren't worth the effort. She basically did the biggest reach known to man and threw a lot of claims of sexism my way. But also said some pretty sexist stuff herself, like how if I'm going to do a feminine hobby then at least I can let it benefit my family. I told her I didn't want that attitude around my son and I wanted her to stay away from me and my family.

Then her husband contacted me, and we've always been cool and he's less of an ass than my sister, but he tried to sway me into doing it and asked me not to be petty or unkind like my family has been to me (which made me realize I want none of them around my son).

they broke up around a few weeks ago and i met him recently and he started venting to me about how miserable and hurt he feels over the fact that their relationship had to end. he wasn't outright crying but i could tell he was getting really teary eyed. it almost felt like he was on the verge of a breakdown. he eventually said something along the lines of how the idea of his ex forgetting him makes him really upset and how the idea of being forgotten by his ex feels like death and how he doesn't want her to forget him anytime soon but at the same time he also wants her to be happy and wishes she could move on.

i almost started laughing hysterically cause this reminded me of the ending of Attack on Titan where the protagonist Eren Yeager cries over the idea of being forgotten by Mikasa Ackerman and later tells her to forget about him. the thing that made it even funnier was the fact that my friend's ex was half east asian just like Mikasa too.

i pointed this out to him and showed him the scenes i mentioned above hoping he'd find it funny too. but he was just upset and angry at me and hasn't talked to me since and blocked me on all socials.

127,1dyx890,AITA for questioning my bfs drug use?,"I am actually going insane. I don’t want to bother my friends with this (plus, they’d be biased to me, which I appreciate but I need fair judgement).

Me (F20) and my boyfriend (M28) have been together for about 10 months or so. Back in November, when I was 19 and he was 27, we broke up. I initiated it because at the time I had some mental health issues and wanted to focus on myself (there was drink involved as well, I’m in a country where legal drinking age is 18+).

He told me he’d go back to using cocaine, that he thought I was a bad person; always ways, always will be, always have been etc. remember drink was involved during this. Also the rest of the relationship he has treated me very well and I love him very much.

Anyway, last night I discovered he had still been taking coke on night outs. I don’t know the extent, whether it was every night out, the odd two times or every other night out. But he said he had an addiction and hated himself for it, so definitely had taken it at some point past the breakup convo.

This hurt me a lot because I thought he had stopped specifically for me- made it out to be during the breakup. ‘I’m going to go back to doing cocaine’, implying my absence would drive him back to addiction.

Now I am no stranger to addiction. I myself have problems with alcohol and I am aware how incredibly hard it is to kick. It’s not the addiction I’m worried about, it’s the fact his words had so much emotional weight and yet it turns out he was still doing cocaine regardless

But also I don’t know if I’m overreacting. It was alllll the way back in November after all. He initially said ‘I have work tomorrow I’m not doing this tonight’ (not verbatim but along the lines), he at one point asked ‘why was I doing this to him’, and now I feel super guilty for even bringing it up. His reaction made me think he’s just struggling with addiction, it was so long ago that he said this anyway; I feel like I’m being stupid because he didn’t specify how many times he did it since the breakup, like what if it was only 2 times?

128,1dywywh,AITA for sending money to dad?,"I’ve been taking care of my parents financially from last 17 years, my mum is not well and she been through coma and lost most of her memory, she is able to take care of her daily chores (bath, washroom, eating, etc). My dad is retired and fortunately has good health and been with her all the time. However he is mostly religious and poet by his profession. He loves to get recognition and awards, but he doesn’t earn anything, I have been sending money every month and for every needs from last 17 years, now I am married (7 years) and I have a child, I’ve been doing my best to make sure my parents get the best comfort, recently my dad sold his property and got some money in his account. 

I moved abroad with my wife and kid last year, my dad was worried as we don’t have any (helping) relatives whom we can count on, so I moved them to a retirement home which is quite expensive, this place takes care of everything (food, cleaning, activities) etc, and my dad always complained about being alone and now he is kinda happy.

Around the same time I bought a new place and spend all my savings for it, I’ve asked my dad to spend his money for the rental and rest of his needs for couple of months until we settle in our new place (yet to buy curtains, furniture etc).

Yesterday he told me that I’ve been good until he sold the property and now I have changed because I am not sending money,  I was like WTF?  What happend to all these years when I was sending you money? Also he knows that I’ll start sending money in 3 months again, every month for the retirment home, not sure how he concluded that I’ve changed 

It made me think was he only thinking about money? Also I started realize more stuff, it’s like when we went to meet him (wife, child) he didn’t even bothered to ask about how are things in abroad, he never asked my wife if she is doing okay, this has been the case since the beginning, I think he lacks basic sense of being in social circle? I really donno, my wife told me he has been taking me for granted and he thinks of only himself, and I feel the same, I dunno wtf is happening.

Now I think about the when my mum complains about her health (cold or fever) he would give over the counter medicine, but if he feels even a minor discomfort he runs to the doc. These kinda experiences makes me think my wife is right.

I trust my wife loves her a lot, she is practical and helps me a lot, I think he should have at least done a part time job and earned something, he had so much time and he wasted.

I want to focus more on my family and our retirement, I don’t expect my child to take care of me.

I feel I’ve been blind all these years and now I am realising,  i thought I’ll share here to know your thoughts.

Sorry for the long post and thanks for being patient.

My dad is retired and fortunately has good health and been with her all the time. However he is mostly religious and poet by his profession. He loves to get recognition and awards, but he doesn’t earn anything, I have been sending money every month and for every needs from last 17 years, now I am married (7 years) and I have a child, I’ve been doing my best to make sure my parents get the best comfort, recently my dad sold his property and got some money in his account. 

I moved abroad with my wife and kid last year, my dad was worried as we don’t have any (helping) relatives whom we can count on, so I moved them to a retirement home which is quite expensive, this place takes care of everything (food, cleaning, activities) etc, and my dad always complained about being alone and now he is kinda happy.

Around the same time I bought a new place and spend all my savings for it, I’ve asked my dad to spend his money for the rental and rest of his needs for couple of months until we settle in our new place (yet to buy curtains, furniture etc).

Yesterday he told me that I’ve been good until he sold the property and now I have changed because I am not sending money,  I was like WTF?  What happend to all these years when I was sending you money? Also he knows that I’ll start sending money in 3 months again, every month for the retirment home, not sure how he concluded that I’ve changed 

It made me think was he only thinking about money? Also I started realize more stuff, it’s like when we went to meet him (wife, child) he didn’t even bothered to ask about how are things in abroad, he never asked my wife if she is doing okay, this has been the case since the beginning, I think he lacks basic sense of being in social circle? I really donno, my wife told me he has been taking me for granted and he thinks of only himself, and I feel the same, I dunno wtf is happening.

Now I think about the when my mum complains about her health (cold or fever) he would give over the counter medicine, but if he feels even a minor discomfort he runs to the doc. These kinda experiences makes me think my wife is right.

I trust my wife loves her a lot, she is practical and helps me a lot, I think he should have at least done a part time job and earned something, he had so much time and he wasted.

I want to focus more on my family and our retirement, I don’t expect my child to take care of me.

I feel I’ve been blind all these years and now I am realising,  i thought I’ll share here to know your thoughts.

Sorry for the long post and thanks for being patient.

129,1dywrkf,AITA for giving my old sofa cushions to my friend?,"I (26F) am currently renovating my house. After a month, the house has been repainted, a false ceiling has been installed, all doors and windows have been polished, and new drapes are being hung. Although the old drapes were in good condition, I disposed of them to make way for the new ones.

When I told my friend P (30M) about this, he said he would have used the old drapes if I had informed him. I then offered him my sofa cushions since I’m getting a new sofa, and he was excited about it. I showed P photos of the cushions, and he asked me to check the cost of sending them via the Porter app. Since I was busy, I told him to check the app himself.

P asked if I would be near his house anytime soon to drop off the cushions, but I said no. He arranged for another friend to pick up the cushions from my house. I sent over ten large cushions, along with newly stitched, dry-cleaned cushion covers.

P was hosting a potluck that day. When people learned I was giving away cushions for free, they all wanted one and texted in the group chat to call dibs. P didn’t text or call to say he received the cushions, so I assumed he was busy and carried on with my work.

Later, he texted me asking if he should dry clean the cushions. I told him he could, but we had already dry-cleaned them, and they were clean. He then replied that they smelled like fish and he was going to throw them away. This hurt me because I keep my house clean, and the cushions didn’t stink. They had been sealed with plastic sheets during the renovation. In fact I was using the same cushions at home till his friend came & took it. Why would I be sitting on it if it smelled like fish? We don’t even cook fish at home. 

Another friend, S (32M), at the potluck told me that P announced my cushions smelled like fish and he was going to throw them away. S told me the cushions smelled neutral to him. I was embarrassed and even more hurt that P had insulted me in front of everyone. Apparently, people at the potluck sniffed the cushions and agreed they had a smell.

I then texted P saying I regret our friendship because he insulted me openly when I was just trying to be nice. He hasn't replied but has been posting on social media targeting me, calling me names like ""caterpillar brain."" So, AITA for getting upset and texting him that I regret our friendship? We weren't close friends, but we are in the same group, and I don't talk to him often.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-09,"AITA for giving my old sofa cushions to my friend?

130,1dywbgh,AITA for acting uncomfortable whenever my mom uses my phone ?,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but I had no idea where to talk about this and the subreddit immediately came into my mind. I wouldn’t consider this a vent but I do feel very bad when thinking about it.

A few days ago, after my mother and I came back from my aunt’s house (almost 2 hours away from our house), she realized she had forgotten her phone there, and although I gave her the idea to ask my aunt so send it by mail, she stated she didn’t want to and that it would let her have a break from using it, so I let it pass (especially because my aunt is coming to visit us in a few days). Little did I know I should’ve insisted.
First, she asked for my phone to make phone calls, which is fine, but then she started needing it every night to listen to a video to help her sleep, and although she falls asleep earlier than me she basically takes my phone every night and leaves me with nothing. Sure, I do other things like reading or drawing, but I often need music to keep concentrating on the other task, and the music is essentially on my phone.
Now, she doesn’t wanna give it back to me until she goes to work (yet she complains about me being obsessed with my phone when she literally takes it everywhere, always holding it). The reason it bothers me so much is simple : she looks through my phone. She has done it and will probably do it again. I had to let her know how I felt so she would understand how wrong it is, I need privacy and she doesn’t need to know everything I do. I’m almost 18 too, which makes matters worse because she won’t let me be until then…
This morning, she told me she ""knew what I was hiding from her"", and all the types of YouTube videos I watched. I assumed she looked through my history but she affirmed that she didn’t. Now that I’ve got it back, I saw it : she did in fact look into my search history, along with who I was subscribed to, and watched some of the videos. She lied to me about not having done that. There’s definitely worse but my mother is very close-minded, so needless to say what she witnessed was despicable to her (""oh no, men trolling online as women, what a disgrace""…).
I’m clearly mad at her, we talked about it way before and she had promised not to do it again, yet here we are. She’s also still trying to tell me my reaction is exaggerated, but I simply feel like I can’t trust her with my phone, and she knows it, with the way I look at the screen whenever she does something just like she does to me, except I don’t get to yell at her to stop, like she does…

131,1dyw2i8,AITA for embarrassing my daughter and messing up her date? ,"This weekend my daughter and I went out to a party with a group of my friends. Some of them brought their kids with them.

My daughter hit it off with a one of my friends son, who she hadn't met before. We were drinking and I overheard them talking about potentially going on a date. It was clear they were interested in each other from their behavior during the party, so I wasn't surprised.

I love my daughter more than anything and want her to be happy. She deserves to be happy.

I went over there when they were planning the date and said, kinda joking, that Logan (my friends son) wasn't right for my daughter, so he can get that idea out of his head.

They asked why. I said Logan was only 22 and my daughter is 25. She needs someone who is financially stable and he's still starting off. I joked maybe in 5 years, but right now he's just a kid. She needs a man.

He laughed and said he understood, no hard feelings. He knows I just want the best for my kid. I said he was a sweet kid, but not the person for my daughter.

I didn't realize she was mad at me till we drove home. She gave me the silent treatment and then didn't talk to me for the rest of the weekend, saying that I ruined her date and embarrassed her.

I go into school at 10am and get off at 1 just in time for me to get picked up by my mom. Since I am struggling in math so much, my teachers came up with a plan for me to take 2 math classes at a time (each class being  2 hours long.) So instead of me getting off of school at 1pm I would get off at 3pm. I knew this would be hard on my  mom so I asked her before I signed up for anything. We were in the car and I proposed the idea. Her words exactly were ""I'll support you in whatever you choose to do"". So a couple weeks later I signed up for the math classes. Math is the only thing holding me back from graduating. Now on to the conflict. I am home most of the time, i cook,  i do the regular chores, and whatever needs to be done i do it. I reminded my mom that the classes start tomorrow and she will need to pick me up at 3pm. She caught an attitude and walked away. She has had this attitude all day and it's kinda ruining my motivation to keep going. I don't know, it's just the constant negative energy. I feel i am the asshole because I think i should've just waited a little longer instead to see if she actually felt comfortable with picking me up later. I don't know. Im quite frankly lost. She always tells me to just get through high school and finish it quickly but now that i have the option to do so its feels wrong. Sorry this seems kinda long!

Good morning guys, I just wanted to come on here and address some of the really common questions that have been asked.

Although he wasn’t entirely absent after he and my mom divorced 25 years ago (following his affair with my now stepmom), he was still very absent in many other ways. My mom remarried, and my stepdad has been nothing but kind and supportive. He’s always been there for me, picking me up when I’m down, and has been a great father figure. His entire family welcomed us with open arms and treated me like their own from day one.



Six years ago, my bio dad and his wife told me they didn’t want to be in my life anymore after my then-boyfriend of two years fell asleep on their living room couch. Following this incident, my dad closed and drained my bank account, as his name was still on it from when I was a minor. My bio dad and his wife have completely twisted the story, making me seem like an entitled brat. They told everyone I stopped talking to them because they closed my credit card when I was on academic probation in college (even though I never had a credit card). Consequently, my bio dad’s family and my stepmom’s family view me as a bad person and haven’t talked to me in years.



Regarding my wedding, I asked all my siblings from both sets of parents to be in it. My bio dad’s and stepmom’s kids dropped out because our dad is upset he’s not walking me down the aisle. I told them I understand and love them anyway, though it breaks my heart knowing they probably won’t show up. My bio dad doesn’t know what I do for work, hasn’t tried to talk to my fiancé, and hasn’t called me in almost two years. I believe he only wants to walk me down the aisle to post pictures on Facebook. So, am I the bad person for telling my bio dad not to walk me down the aisle?

Following this incident, my dad closed and drained my bank account, as his name was still on it from when I was a minor. My bio dad and his wife have completely twisted the story, making me seem like an entitled brat. They told everyone I stopped talking to them because they closed my credit card when I was on academic probation in college (even though I never had a credit card). Consequently, my bio dad’s family and my stepmom’s family view me as a bad person and haven’t talked to me in years.



Regarding my wedding, I asked all my siblings from both sets of parents to be in it. My bio dad’s and stepmom’s kids dropped out because our dad is upset he’s not walking me down the aisle. I told them I understand and love them anyway, though it breaks my heart knowing they probably won’t show up. My bio dad doesn’t know what I do for work, hasn’t tried to talk to my fiancé, and hasn’t called me in almost two years. I believe he only wants to walk me down the aisle to post pictures on Facebook. So, am I the bad person for telling my bio dad not to walk me down the aisle?

136,1dyv8md,AITA for being done acting as my friend’s therapist,"I (28nb) am growing tired of playing therapist for my 31 yr old friend. 

We both have BPD, however, they are more so the type to hold onto every negative trait of the disorder and it’s wearing me down. I struggled intensively with it from 8-23, then put 5 years into myself. 

She is constantly seeking assurance, which I am happy to validate…..if she would let me. I can’t tell her I care for her and love her, without getting hit with “I don’t deserve friends” or something of that context. 

She will throw in my face that it’s “easy for me” bc I have a SO. Whom I would not have if I hadn’t taken 5 years to grow. 

She met a guy the other day and immediately fell victim to lust and was spiraling when, 5 messages in, he wasn’t ready for a relationship. She then spent 2 hours wallowing across all platforms and the group chat. We constantly tell her she can’t pour from an empty cup, and as much as that sucks to hear…it is true.

She will make posts begging people to boost her and then ignores every comment. You can’t say anything positive to her without her immediately shutting it down.

I love her dearly, but I can’t keep fucking playing therapist when I have my own shit that’s taking the back burner for someone who won’t even accept the support. I no longer want to be the person she seeks out because it’s wasted energy on my part because Ashe will not listen and then gets mad at me for not fixing her. When I can’t.

We tried to support him to move to an area with cheaper priced housing and a good job opportunity for him. He paid us £200 per month rent. He is a bit of a hoarder and collects a lot of stuff. He purchased a motorbike with my consent to put on my garage. He also bought a bicycle without my consent to put it in the garage and did anyway. And a lot of tools and power tools including a 5 foot by 4 foot tool chest. His tools were supposed to live at work but he got sacked. To be honest his employer was a bit of a piss taker about him getting sacked and cut corners it was over some unfair stuff but he didn't help it by calling in sick a lot and breaking health and safety rules. He ended up unable to pay rent and living with us for 4 months with us feeding him and everything. He moved out and found scratches on his bicycle when he got to his next place. He sent pictures and lectured me on not being able to look after shit. I said well it was crowded in there with his shit, I don't know if it was me but if it was it would be because I had to rearrange my entire garage every time I wanted something and it was cramped with his stuff however fair enough, call it 4 months rent he didn't pay. Aparantly it isn't fair of me to use the rent on him because I allowed him to stay. Aparantly I should apologise. He damaged our new toilet seat and new living room fan and never apologised.

138,1dyv47d,AITA for maybe worsening my dad's mood?,"(first time making a reddit post and usually very anxious about sharing any personal info online but have been struggling with my relationship with my dad. my family's not very good at discussing emotions and mental health so i want to get some outside perspectives.)

So for context, I (16f) got my AP scores back today. I did really well on all 3 tests and wanted to celebrate with my family, and we decided to go out to eat dinner. My dad was working on fixing up a property that we are preparing to sell when my mom drove my 2 younger sisters and I to the property to pick him up. My sisters and I went inside while my mom was waiting in the car outside. He was working upstairs and the three of us were downstairs trying to call him down (we didn't want to go upstairs with our shoes on). He didn't reply at all, so we decided to wait around for a bit and ended up being kind of noisy and loud. Eventually, we tried calling for him again and he told us to get out and leave first in an angry tone. He was probably already stressed but grew more irritated bc of the noise. We did leave the property after my mom tried to call him on the phone unsuccessfully, and decided to go on to the restaurant. We didn't contact each other throughout the meal. He never showed up. I was disappointed but didn't want to ruin my mom and sisters' mood so I didn't say anything. We took out food for him and went back to the property but he had already left, so we drove home. I was worried, mad at myself, all that jazz atp and tried to talk to him while he was eating but he didn't want to talk.

Overall, I was sad that I wasn't able to celebrate an achievement with my dad and regretted not being able to communicate openly with him. Should I have been more compassionate and done more to salvage the situation? Looking back now a few hours later I feel I made several wrong choices :(

140,1dyung8,AITA for telling my husband's girl best friend she can't host my baby shower?,"I (22f) and my husband (23m) got married young, I was eighteen, he was nineteen. Both of us knew we always wanted to get married and start a family young. I started college two years ago, and he just graduated with a Bachelor of Biomedical Science. My husband has a girl best friend (23f), who i'll call Sam, who he met in College, both of them grew up Baptist, and while he's left the church, they had a very similar childhood and bonded quite quickly. Despite what you may be thinking her and I got along really well. She and I liked the same music and we were both studying in relatively the same fields so she became a friend of mine as well.

Since I found out I was pregnant though, some issues have started to arise. We announced our pregnancy on social media after we told our parents. Sam texted my husband a congrats text and then told him to pass on her well wishes to me. She's been texting him nonstop with baby advice and what she likes to call ""advice for mama"" which includes sometimes relatively targeted jabs at what I should eat. Honestly i kept brushing the texts off, but it got a point where the conversations were less about the baby and more about me which I was getting increasingly uncomfortable with because she wasn't texting me she was texting my husband. My husband acknowledged this and has just started to show them to me and ask what I want him to do. I just told him to ignore them.

When i announced I was having a baby shower and sent out the invites, I recieved a text from Sam. She said something along the lines of wanting to host my baby shower and set it up. I told her politely that my mom was planning on hosting it with the help of my sister and that it was a special moment for them and I wouldn't want to take that away. Well Sam ignored that message, because the next day, she came over and insisted we start working out arrangements for the venue.

I told her once again, my mom and sister were hosting it and she told me that she should take her advice and let her plan it because she'd ensure that the baby shower would be better if she planned it particularly because she'd be working on the menu.

Whether it was pregnancy hormones or just bottled up rage, i told her that the jabs she'd been making at me behind my back about my diet during this pregnancy to my husband are really annoying at that no she cannot host this shower and from now on her unsolicited advice was not appreciated especially if she can't say it to my face.

That night my husband's phone blew up with messages from Sam saying that he had no right to show her those messages and they were just supposed to just be health tips because Sam was studying nutritional science and only wanted to help her best friend and ensure a happy baby and life.

141,1dyujbo,AITA My reaction to In-laws’ response to mother’s health,"My husband (51F), Jeff, and I (49F) have been married for 11 years. Due to a variety of reasons, as a couple, we’re closer to his family than mine while I still maintain a very tight relationship independently with my immediate family. Recently, my mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness with less than a year to live - we’ve been dealing with multiple hospital trips, doctors visits, logistical nightmares, and adapting to the reality of her impending passing - my family and I are an emotional mess and it’s been really tough. 

Late last week my husband was speaking with his family about upcoming travel plans. He was questioning his availability due to my family situation which his dad, my FIL, rephrased - perhaps jokingly - as him not being able to go due to him needing to “babysit” me during this trying time. Jeff joked back saying that “yes, he always needs to babysit me”.  This struck a bad chord with me, felt like both Jeff and his dad minimized the gravity and impact of the situation, and was insensitive to say the least. Quickly after that, my FIL decided that now was the right time to tell me that we need to ensure that the family financial future is discussed and that I should work to ensure my Mother’s estate will go into a trust for my brothers and I instead of a will due to probate court, etc. While I don’t disagree, I felt this was ill-timed, advice my siblings and I are already aware of, and frankly, none of his business. 

After the discussion, I told Jeff how I felt about these two interactions. He reacted with anger, told me that I was being too sensitive, that they were only joking with the babysitting comment, “that’s just the way his dad is” about the finance/will discussion, and then stormed off. Ultimately, I shared that I needed more sensitivity and to please be more careful about the words being used - this is new territory for me emotionally so I am more sensitive than usual. He reiterated that it was only joking and that is the way my FIL relates. We reconciled. 

Tonight because we weren’t in a heightened, angry state, I wanted to express my feelings to make sure we were on the same page. I calmly reiterated that I don’t want his parents to think he’s not traveling due to my Mom’s situation and that I’d like to avoid any discussions about finances at this time. He blew up, reiterated that it was a joke, it’s the way his dad relates, and that he doesn’t need me to keep bringing it up (I haven’t since the night of). It ended with him storming off again, us sleeping separately.

She ended up apologizing, but after I said that tangent, as an asian mom she said ""Well, it was just fucking sitting on the edge behind the TV, taking up space"" I was generally so mad I had no words because who uses someone else's belonging without asking and then basically destroying it before giving it back.

144,1dyu9um,AITA for kicking my boyfriend’s family out and refusing to let them move back in after finding out his brother has cancer?,"I (32F) managed to buy a house in 2020 with my savings from working as a nurse when home prices and interest rates were low. About two years ago, my boyfriend's mom, his ex-convict brother, his brother's wife, and their two kids moved in with me.

Initially, things were okay, but problems started when I began working night shifts six months ago. Every time I came home, the house was a complete mess—dirty dishes, trash everywhere, just total neglect. It became increasingly stressful to return after long shifts to such chaos. To add on to that, they were super loud during the day so I couldn’t get any rest for my following shift. It was just too many people for a small 2 bedroom home. 

Despite numerous conversations about cleaning up after themselves, nothing changed. On top of that, I felt like my hospitality was being taken advantage of. They didn't contribute financially, and I started feeling like a free hotel.

I finally reached my limit and told them they needed to find another place to live. My boyfriend is upset, saying I should be more understanding, especially since his brother recently found out he has stomach cancer after I forced him out. Now, he has no way of getting to his doctors appointments.

Even though his brother doesn’t contribute, my boyfriend pays for around of half the bills. The house is solely under my name and he didn't contribute to the down payment. Despite this, he feels I'm being too harsh.

Reddit, am I the asshole for kicking them out given their current hardships?

Me and my best friend knew each other for 6 years. He introduced me to his gf way back in February. At first, I didn't like her; she was rude / bitchy / annoying, but over time we started talking more and more and no, we are not cheating. Now in mid-March, my bsf and his gf started fighting a lot and then it kept getting worse from here on out. She would always come to me and ask for advice and solutions, but over time we started talking more and getting close and we ended up becoming best friends. My bsf became a different person; he became controlling, abusive, and rude to his gf, for example, calling her a bitch and a slut every time they argued and became controlling, telling her what to wear, where to go out, who to hang with, and so I started trying to make her feel better. I reassured her by saying I will always be here for you and I was just acting as a good bsf because she didn't deserve any of this.

146,1dytshu,AITA for not going to my boyfriend’s uncle’s funeral? ,"My boyfriend of almost 6 years lost his uncle in a tragic car accident this last weekend. It was obviously super sudden and sad for everyone. The celebration of life is going to be on the 23rd as he has family traveling from his home country for the event. 

I have been trying to be as supportive as I can. However, I am studying for the NY bar exam that takes place on July 30-31. This is arguably the hardest exam of my life and I’ve spent weeks preparing for it. The celebration of life will take place in North Carolina so we would have to fly there. 

Last night, my boyfriend told me he was looking at flights for us from the 20th-23rd. I informed him that as much as I’d like to go, I can’t take that time off from studying a week before the bar exam. He got very upset and told me to just bring my study materials. 

I know myself and how crowded the house is going to be as family comes in, I won’t get anything done. The exam is only administered twice a year (July and Feb) and I wouldn’t be refunded the money I spent to sign up for the exam. 

He called me an AH for putting an exam above the death of such a close relative and walked out of the house. That was about an hour ago, and his best friend texted me that he is staying with him and that I “need to get my priorities straight”

147,1dytpbr,AITA if I choose to go to Japan over possibly attending my brother’s dream work promotion/graduation ceremony ,"**Context:** 

I work freelance for a big company in my space (as a contractor), and only this year, I have had the absolute pleasure of traveling internationally for their big events. Their next or last big event of the year is scheduled to be in Korea from July 27th to August 26th. The company has a travel agency that is in charge of dealing with booking flights for the workers. When the topic of Korea came into conversation, my co-workers from my department understood how my dream is to visit and travel to Japan (specifically to the world's biggest fish market), and my co-workers gave me a great idea. Because Korea is closer to Japan than it is where I currently reside, why not just ask the travel agency to book two one-way tickets: one to Korea and one back home from Japan. I can save about $1000 on the plane ticket alone. I was hesitant as per my social anxiety. Then my co-worker, whom I am decently close to, says to me that they are actually planning a solo trip to Japan and if I’d like to join them. That gave my social anxiety relief as my co-worker is someone I trust and get along with, and they have traveled to Japan before and voiced that they are extremely down to knock stuff off my checklist as they are going with no plan. Thus, I sent the two one-way ticket options to the travel agency and got approved. I planned for this trip to go from August 26th to September 5th. 


**The dilemma enters:**

Today, my mother approaches me, asking when I leave again, to which I tell her July 27th to September 5th. She says, “Oh no,” to which I ask, “What? Why??” She replies, “Because your brother Jay (we will call him Jay) is having his work graduation on August 26th–30th, he still has to choose the day.” I’m just left a bit speechless and upset, as all of a sudden, a week after booking flights, I get to find out about this graduation. I then also get a text from Jay adding me and my other brother Dave (we will call him Dave) to the to the group chat, trying to find out what day works for us for his ceremony. I feel completely shit and at odds with this. I told him I am traveling, working abroad, and cant. Important to note: This is my brother's dream job, which he has wanted since forever. 

**Where I’m at:**

I’m not sure if it’s the people-pleaser in me or the voice in my head that says family is over everything, but I feel so at odds. I feel that there are only three options here:
 
* Don’t go to my brothers ceremony and stick with the Japan trip. 
* Cancel the Japan trip have agency try to book me a flight back home Aug 26. 
* Have the agency try and change the flight so I get home Aug 29th from Japan but only stay in Japan 2 days.

148,1dytlmr,AITA for insisting that you can travel from Nunavut to South America by foot? ,"Okay so… I (36M) just got into a little spat with my friend (24F) as we were re-watching GOT. Approaching this conversation Jon snow had just gone north of the wall for the first time and the character “Craster” clearly states that in regard to the Mance Raydar army there’s only one place for them to go… south. But I disagreed. I said “if they went further north then eventually they’d get to the south.” Much like if u were to (in the real world) walk from Nunavut north you would quickly find yourself In South America. Now this is where it got ugly. 

My friend is neurotypical and she calmly attempted to explain that in fact it would not be quick nor easy to travel such depths. The wildlings did not have the resources nor the technology we do here today to make such a journey. But you see, (in the real world) we do have those things that the wildlings don’t. When I disagreed again she said that she doesn’t wanna finish the rest of the show. 

I offered to make us some popcorn, because I was starting to feel heated and that maybe we had both overreacted, and I know my friend can get grumpy when she’s hungry. I told her to halt! (Hungry, angry, lonely, tired). I told her she couldn’t be lonely, because she was with me, and so she must be hungry. She didn’t take this the right way at all. She rolled her eyes and started explaining how last year, 500,000 migrants crossed the Darien gap, and how difficult and dangerous the journey is. She *pointed* at me and said that if a 60 mile journey over mountainous rainforest was one of the most dangerous journeys you could attempt, then surely, 1300 miles walking across the frozen wasteland of Nunavut alone, would be nearly impossible. 

I screamed back, “nearly!” I caught her in a web of logical fallacies!

I said I didn’t want to fight anymore, and that she should just respect my opinion, and that we might never know the answer. To be clear, this woman is 12 years younger than me, where has she walked? 

She slept over anyways but she only said she’d stay if I agreed to disagree. And I hate that, it doesn’t seem fair.

151,1dytav7,AITA for not making my fiancé’s niece the flower girl? ,"I, 26F, am engaged to my fiancé (who we will call Matt), 27M who I’ve been dating for 5 years. We are getting married next March, and are very excited. We’ve come across our first disagreement for our wedding. 

Matt and I have had many conversations about wanting a child-free wedding. It’s not the first time it’s come up, and something we’ve talked about for a while. We’ve even talked about our grandparents being the flower girls and ring bearers. 

About a year ago, Matt’s older sister (who we will call Rachel) adopted a baby. Shes been a joy to the whole family after her and her husband struggled with infertility. 

A few days ago, as we were making the wedding FAQ, we got to the part of writing that it’s a child-free wedding. Matt said “do you think we need to clarify that this doesn’t include the flower girl?” I was pretty surprised and asked what he meant. He went on to explain that Rachel’s daughter would be old enough to be a flower girl by then so he went ahead asked his sister. 

I was honestly shocked he asked his sister this without even running it by me. He said it was after a few glasses of wine at family dinner when I was out of town so he didn’t ask me but thought I wouldn’t care. 

I told him that we can’t make exceptions for one child in his family after I’ve told my older cousins about the child-free wedding and that they can’t bring their kids (ranging from 1-9). He said it was different because it was his only niece, not a cousin’s kid. I rebutted by saying as an only child, my cousins acted as siblings and this was a decision we had made together. 

We went back and forth until we realized we were going in circles between him saying he can’t take it back now, and me saying we didn’t account for all the kids we have in our wedding towards the venue (leading to cuts in our wedding invites if we include all children). 

He implied that I was being AH for not letting his niece be apart of the wedding and we went to bed. So Reddit, AITA?

A few days ago, as we were making the wedding FAQ, we got to the part of writing that it’s a child-free wedding. Matt said “do you think we need to clarify that this doesn’t include the flower girl?” I was pretty surprised and asked what he meant. He went on to explain that Rachel’s daughter would be old enough to be a flower girl by then so he went ahead asked his sister. 

I was honestly shocked he asked his sister this without even running it by me. He said it was after a few glasses of wine at family dinner when I was out of town so he didn’t ask me but thought I wouldn’t care. 

I told him that we can’t make exceptions for one child in his family after I’ve told my older cousins about the child-free wedding and that they can’t bring their kids (ranging from 1-9). He said it was different because it was his only niece, not a cousin’s kid. I rebutted by saying as an only child, my cousins acted as siblings and this was a decision we had made together. 

We went back and forth until we realized we were going in circles between him saying he can’t take it back now, and me saying we didn’t account for all the kids we have in our wedding towards the venue (leading to cuts in our wedding invites if we include all children). 

He implied that I was being AH for not letting his niece be apart of the wedding and we went to bed. So Reddit, AITA? ",0.0,0.04409724101424217,0,1
152,1dyt7mp,AITA for telling my mom I felt she didn't care about my childhood?,"It's not the best title for this, but the best way I could come up with to explain it. I (older teen genderfluid) was raised by my mom (56) and dad (52).

 Growing up, money was tight, not necessarily struggling, but certainly not upper middle class. As a kid, I knew that my parents were older and being the only young child at family gatherings, I'd end up talking with the adults 99% of the time.

 The issue arose a couple months ago when I started thinking about how as a kid my parents would take me on big trips that would cost lots of money but I wouldn't always get any presents that I really liked on my birthday. Anytime I would ask for any sort of electronic device or nice clothes like my friends had, I would be told that they didn't want to spend money on such things and that I should be appreciative that they were taking me on trips that I would remember for years rather than spending it on items I would grow out of. 

Unfortunately, because of this, I was outcasted in my social circle. I was bullied relentlessly for being weird and realized that it likely wouldn't have been as bad if I had been able to relate to the things my peers enjoyed, rather than things adults enjoyed.

 I brought this up to her recently, and she snapped, saying that I if I really hated my childhood that much, she must just be the worst mother in the world. I tried to explain that that's not at all what I meant and I simply was confused as to why we were able to spend so much money (thousands of dollars) on trips but I was never able to get anything she deemed was not worth the money. I tried to explain that it felt more like trips for her and her parents rather than a gift for me and that my birthday or Christmas was just an excuse to go on them.

 She said I should be grateful that I have all these memories. I told her that I do have fond memories of being on these trips, but they were never experiences I could share with people my age, only my immediate family. She said that I don't even talk to the friends from that time anymore, so what is it even matter. 

I'm really worried I came off as selfish and bratty, but I just wish I could have had a more typical childhood, considering I was already struggling. I apologize and left her alone about it but I would love to have some input from people not directly involved in the situation.

153,1dyswco,AITA for telling my mom I was upset her and my sister planned a trip without me to see my dying grandma,"I (28F) texted my mom this morning that I was hurt that I got left out of a trip this weekend to see my grandma who probably only has weeks left to live. My twin had scheduled to see her in August but due to her health she changed the trip to this weekend. My sister and my mom had this whole trip planned without me, so when I heard about it I got upset because my grandma may pass away. Ofc I want and need to see her. Last night when I mentioned it my mom said she had cancelled the trip because her sister that she hates is up there (idk some random excuse imo) but when I texted her this morning she told me she had a flight saved for me. 

That’s when I got confused because if she saved me a flight I would like to know because of work accommodations and just knowing the plan? I told my mom I was not understanding why she was booking a flight for me without my knowledge on top of saying the trip was cancelled and that’s when hell broke loose. Within 10 minutes I get a cryptic text from my sister that I ruined the trip and had it cancelled. Her text - “Because of you mom is canceling the trip because your a child and got your feelings hurt. If something happens to grandma and I didn’t get to see her. You are dead to me. I want you to know that. Actually I’m just going to block your number because I don’t want to deal with you and your shit”.  

I never asked my mom to book me a flight btw I just wanted to join the trip! So after all of this I said fuck it Im an adult so I made the decision to go by myself to see my grandma instead. I let my mom know and then her sisters started texting me telling me how insensitive I was to see grandma in such a weak state of mind and that I can’t come. My dad then sends this long ass text about how im not welcome at home and that im a bitch full of drama. He threatened me to not come around anymore and my mom is telling me that im making this all her fault and that she can’t do anything right… how she has skin cancer and I’m ungrateful, all this shit when all I asked was IF I COULD SEE MY GRANDMA.   

My sister then called my bestfriend telling him that I told her he tried to take advantage of me (lol I don’t even know where she got that from but she’s upset I didn’t want to stay with her in the hotel for his wedding and this is a reason why!) but she called him today to try and get me uninvited from his wedding.

Last weekend I (18M) was hanging out at my friend Leo's (19M) place, having a good time watching movies and catching up. At some point, he asked to borrow my phone to make a call since his was charging in another room. I hesitated a bit because I'm very protective of my phone, but eventually, I agreed.

A few minutes later I hear a splash from the bathroom. Leo dropped my phone into the toilet while she was using it. He immediately fished it out, but needless to say, it was completely ruined. I was so upset and frustrated because now I needed to buy a new phone.

When I asked Leo to at lest help pay for a new phone, he got defensive and started saying it was an accident and that I should have been more understanding. He even suggested that since I can afford a new phone (I kinda can't), it shouldn't be a big deal for me to replace it myself.

I felt like I was completely in the right here. Leo was the one who dropped my phone in the toilet, and now I'm out of pocket for a replacement.

Our current situation is that I work full time flexible shifts anywhere from 4 days to 6 days a week ranging from 32 to 52 hours a week and after work I go home and go to bed as my job is physically taxing and I more often then not start at 3am. He is unemployed and is on benefits. 

While I’m at work my Ex has our daughter at his dad’s house and I have her on my days off. 

I do my best to help my Ex to look after her, even providing him my bank card to pay for her food. But after he messed about with my bank account spending £400 on takeaways, £500 for one supermarket shop plus untold amounts on internet shopping and games. I took it off him and made a deal of £70 every time he picks her up from mine, I’ve said if he needs more to let me know and what it’s for and that I’d happily provide if it was for our daughter. 

He doesn’t provide her any extra money to the best of my knowledge, everything bought for her is either done by me or with the money I’ve given him. 

The other week just before our daughters 2nd birthday he approached me and said that £70 isn’t enough and that he wanted more and then asked me to put my card back on his Apple Pay, I refused. 

He went on to call me a shit Mum and accused me about lying about my work schedule even though I’ve shown him the schedule and he knows the kind of shifts I work from when we lived together. 

He then went on to ask me to add him back on Snapchat so he can monitor my location I again refused. 

Today on my way to work I stopped off at a supermarket and bumped into both my ex and my daughter, when I told him where I was going he called me a liar and saw his arse.

I (20m) am dating my gf Sarah(20f) for 3 years now. She has this friend Josh(20m) who she’s been friends with since middle school. They’re pretty close friends and consider each other as a sister/brother. I met my gf in high school and did not really talk to each other until Josh put us in a group chat together.

My neighbor, who has been living there for about 20 years or so, decided to cut some good sized limbs down from the tree today that were hanging down in their yard.

I confronted them about it. Asking why the needed to cut the tree. The limps weren’t dead. They said they are tried of it dropping leaves in their yard. Mentally I was like ITS A TREE! IT DOES THAT! But I remained calm and said “Okay, well can you come pick up the limbs you cut down?” And they said no because it’s not their tree. 

I don’t understand. They’ve lived at this house for years and never once did they ever express a complaint about this tree. Or tried to cut it before.

I met a new friend a few months ago and have been seeing her weekly since, she’s lovely, kind, generous and funny. She does like to get on the drink almost everyday however which I understand can be problematic, but she never gets out of hand or rude. If she has too much to drink she will just go quiet and go home. 

She was looking for a new place to rent due to old house mates being weird & making her uncomfortable to the point where she felt like she had to stay in he room. She found a place on fb which so happened to be my best friends house who I’ve known for 12 years.

My best friend asked if I knew her and if she’d make a good housemate - I was honest and said I had only known her for a few months and couldn’t say as I don’t know what it’s like to live with her. 

New friend asked me if living there would be safe etc, I said it should be fine and she’s pretty chill. 

However the day before new friend moved in, her old house mates that all abruptly left that weekend told me how disrespectful, delusional, rude and greedy my best friend was & how they found out how much the house was to rent vs how much she was charging. All her house mates were overcharged so my best friend and her bf rent was covered by them whilst also making a profit. 

I feel guilty for new friend for saying it would be fine but I didn’t know what my best friend had been doing previously. 

I feel disgusted in my best friend & her bf for using people during a rental crisis & acting like they’re always broke & getting me to shout them drinks/food mean while she isn’t paying any rent, making a profit. All these years she has been lying to me. 

I asked new friend last night how much she was paying rent and I was shocked. She’s put the rent up even more.

I’ve always been the designated driver friend since high school when I got my first car. I honestly didn’t mind it then.

Some don’t drive, some don’t have cars, and some just don’t like to drive their own cars or make excuses and say they “can’t.” I’m always the one picking everybody up, dropping everybody off, I’ve even been put in situations where I’m picking up a “friend of a friend” that I barely know. My friends don’t ever offer to pay for gas, pay for parking, or clean up after themselves. I get a small “I appreciate you” here and there, but I don’t see any actions to show that.

I stopped saying yes to plans, said I was busy, and started making plans with other friends.

168,1dyrect,AITA for not doing enough to accommodate my downstairs neighbors' noise complaint?,"My partner & I own a condo on the second floor of a 100+ year old building. The couple who rent the unit below ours --- let's call them Billy & Jane --- texted us a few months ago saying that they had been hearing occasional loud thuds at night, asking if we had any idea what could be causing them. Wanting to be considerate neighbors, we went back & forth with them for a while trying to figure out the cause of the problem.  
  
Eventually I had a realization that one of our cats might be the source of the noise. He's a pretty hefty guy and is super affectionate to the point that he gets anxious if he's not sleeping directly next to my head --- he'll often wake me up by stepping on my hair, nuzzling against me, stealing my pillow, etc. These disturbances would cause me to sometimes toss him off the bed in my half-awake state. We all agreed to test this by tossing him, and sure enough, that's what they were hearing. We apologized and said that I would be more mindful of this and make an effort not to throw him off the bed anymore.  
  
A few weeks later, my partner ran into Jane and asked her if the noise had gotten any better, and she thanked us and said that it had indeed been happening a lot less frequently. That was the last we'd heard about it until a few nights ago. It was a Friday night around 12:30 AM and I accidentally dropped my plastic water bottle off the bed. A few moments later, we heard a super loud banging that sounded like it was coming from our floor. We immediately texted them to ask if they heard the noise or if it was them.  
  
They didn't text us back until the following night, and essentially told us that this was the fifth consecutive night that they'd been awoken by incessant noises, and they were begging us to limit our activities at night. This was really confusing to hear because we don't think we're doing anything unreasonable or out of the ordinary.  
  
My understanding is that Billy is under a lot of stress as he's studying for the bar exam, so I can see how he would be having trouble sleeping and neighbor noise could be contributing. However, I feel like we've been trying our best to handle the situation civilly thusfar and Billy is being the childish one by stewing on this for five straight nights without communication, banging on his ceiling, and only \*then\* deciding to tell us there's an issue.  
  
My position is that he chose to live on the ground floor of a very old multi-tenant building when he could have instead picked a top-floor unit or lived in a high rise building with concrete floors. Not to mention that we live in a neighborhood known for its nightlife, and the alley adjacent to both of units often has a lot of noise from drunk pedestrians. We have also had noisy upstairs neighbors in previous apartments, but I feel us though that's part of the reality of living in an old apartment in a city.

A few weeks later, my partner ran into Jane and asked her if the noise had gotten any better, and she thanked us and said that it had indeed been happening a lot less frequently. That was the last we'd heard about it until a few nights ago. It was a Friday night around 12:30 AM and I accidentally dropped my plastic water bottle off the bed. A few moments later, we heard a super loud banging that sounded like it was coming from our floor. We immediately texted them to ask if they heard the noise or if it was them.  
  
They didn't text us back until the following night, and essentially told us that this was the fifth consecutive night that they'd been awoken by incessant noises, and they were begging us to limit our activities at night. This was really confusing to hear because we don't think we're doing anything unreasonable or out of the ordinary.  
  
My understanding is that Billy is under a lot of stress as he's studying for the bar exam, so I can see how he would be having trouble sleeping and neighbor noise could be contributing. However, I feel like we've been trying our best to handle the situation civilly thusfar and Billy is being the childish one by stewing on this for five straight nights without communication, banging on his ceiling, and only \*then\* deciding to tell us there's an issue.  
  
My position is that he chose to live on the ground floor of a very old multi-tenant building when he could have instead picked a top-floor unit or lived in a high rise building with concrete floors. Not to mention that we live in a neighborhood known for its nightlife, and the alley adjacent to both of units often has a lot of noise from drunk pedestrians. We have also had noisy upstairs neighbors in previous apartments, but I feel us though that's part of the reality of living in an old apartment in a city.  
  
  
So, reddit, are we the assholes here? Should we be doing more to honor his request, or is he being unreasonable?",0.0,0.03275289386510849,0,1
169,1dyrb1y,AITA don't want to tell my sister about the baby playpen,"I am 36, married, and have a 5-year-old, a 2-year-old, and a 10-month-old. There's a lot going on, and stress levels are high. My wife constantly fears our children getting sick because she is a stay-at-home mom and has to deal with sick children. I understand the frustration of a sick child, but I believe it can only be controlled to a certain extent and shouldn't limit activities.

My sister, who has three children in daycare, believes that sickness is inevitable. Unless it’s an extreme illness, she brings her children to family functions, pays attention, and wipes noses, but germs still spread, and my kids have gotten sick from them (and vice versa). My wife thinks my sister shouldn't bring sick children to gatherings, but we’ve done the same.

The issue at hand is our upcoming family beach trip with 13 of us. We have a baby playpen for our 10-month-old to crawl around in. My wife wants to bring it but demands that I tell my family only our child can use it. I think this rule is a bit absurd and offered different solutions to avoid conflict:

1. Don't bring the playpen and instead bring a baby walker to avoid any discussion with my family. It also takes up less space in the communal living room.
2. Bring the playpen, but if my wife doesn't want other kids in it, she should talk to my family about it.

My wife got frustrated and called me the asshole for taking my family's side and for putting her in a situation where she has to talk to them. She says if others want a playpen, they should bring their own. I suggested that if I have to talk to them, it’s respectful to do so before the trip so they can plan accordingly. I also said solution #1 might be best due to limited space in the communal area. She thinks they won't bring one anyway so the limited space argument is irrelevant and insists we bring ours, calling me the asshole for suggesting otherwise.

We’ll be together for a week, and if someone is going to get sick, it will happen with or without the playpen. AITA?

171,1dyr4nb,AITA for making a quilt out of gifted baby clothes?,"Hi all, so I (26F) have 2 kids, a 4 yo daughter a 6 mo son. When I was pregnant I was gifted alot of clothes, baby blankets, sheets, all sorts of items from women in my family and friends group. The bulk of it was for newborn babies and bassinets. I also have a lot of clothes that my daughter has grown out of as well. In short I have a lot of baby items in excess.

I recently took up sewing as a hobby. It started with altering my own clothes because I can never find pants that make short enough legs for me. Then I found a pattern for an infinity scarf online that I thought I would make for my daughter. I ended up using fabric from my sons old basinett  sheets because it had teddy bears on it. I thought it would be really pretty. I then decided to make a quilt from my sons baby clothes that I was going to gift to him for his 1st birthday.

Well, my MIL(54F) came to my room (Keep in mind we live together, I have my own small cabin that serves as a bedroom) the other day and saw me cutting up my sons old clothes. She then asked ""OP, what are you doing? Why are you cutting up all his baby clothes?"" I told her ""Oh I had all these so I wanted to make a quilt for his 1st birthday"" She just stared at the squares of fabric that I cut and said ""These are good clothes, why are you ruining them? And these are gifts you're ruining"" I said to her ""Well, I don't think I'm ruining them, I'm putting them to use since he can't fit them anymore"" These could be donated for other babies that need them, there's nothing wrong with them and why don't you keep them for when you have another baby? At this point ai could see her getting angry ""I don't plan on having another baby, and thought that making a quilt for him would be a good idea"" She said ""You should just save them OP, or donate them if you don't want them"" I replied ""Oh"" and I went quiet after this because I know that if I kept talking it'll escalate. So she said said ""Yeah, don't cut them up, that's just a waste, keep them"" and she walked away.

When I went into the dining room later that night, I could hear her talking to FIL (56M) about it. Her room is connected to the living room which is connected to the dining room. I heard her say that I was cutting up good baby clothes that she and the family gave me and said I was ungrateful because I was ruining gifts. He was talking about how he agreed and that I should've just given the clothes back if I didn't want them. They went on for about a half hour before they walked out and realised I was feeding my kids at the table. None of them said anything, and just continued past me outside. I had my head down and felt really embarrassed.

I honestly thought because he had grown out of them and because I have no need for them anymore, that it wouldn't be that big of a deal if I repurposed them. At least they stay in the family.

172,1dyq5ib,AITA for returning my cat,"backstory I F 19 adopted my cat from a shelter about 8 months ago he’s a very big orange tabby ex tom cat ( he’s fixed now) with FIV, i decided about last month right after moving a to a new house that i was ready for him to have a friend his size. We have four dogs that he likes but they aren’t great at playing with him. I found another cat that looked very similar to him with FIV as well and decided to get him. I did the proper acclimation for the new cat keeping him in a small enclosed place with places to hide until he started to ask for attention. From there i started letting them see each other through a baby cat. This went horribly the new cat started meowing at him not in a mean way just a normal meow so i thought that it wasn’t a bad thing. Since they weren’t showing any aggressive signs (or so i thought) i let them meet face to face. The first time was only for a couple minutes and the new cat was only meowing at my old cat. The trouble started the second face to face meeting. The new cat attacked my new cat unprovoked. It started but him just meowing at my old cat and then pouncing on him. i broke it up and separated them. The new cat was really for a larger area so i put him in the bathroom during the day and my old cat roaming the rest of the house. This way they can smell each other and he could also smell the dogs through the door. i would territory swap them from my room the bathroom and the rest of the house. I tried letting them eat on different sides of a baby hate but the new cat jumped over it and attacked my cat. Every time they ever saw each other face to face, it resulted in a fight the new cat being the aggressor. I knew i couldn’t keep them separate forever and with no improvement over a months span, i made the hard decision to return him to the shelter. I really love my old cat but i also loved to new cat, he was the most snuggly cat I have ever met. Is there something that I did wrong? 

Edit: I returned the new cat not my old cat. And the new cat was only four while my cat is about 9 1/2. Also I didn’t just let his get attacked I had a spray bottle handy when they were having interactions and a towel, but i also took measures like putting kitty caps on both cats so they couldn’t do damage if they did fight.

175,1dyps92,"AITA for asking my brother not to pay my daughter’s university tuition, as it was a deliberate consequence of her choices?","My daughter will be attending university this fall, however, after much discussion she has chosen a school we disagree over. Initially I had preferred if I was to pay her full tuition that she would attend our local university and live at home. She convinced us to let her expand that search under the guise she was applying only to Catholic schools. When she was accepted into Georgetown University in Washington, DC, I was hesitant due to the 17 hour drive from Baton Rouge where we live… We were persuaded after a tour and because she was offered merit-based and needs-based scholarships which would cover nearly all of her tuition. Additionally, my brother and his spouse moved to Maryland near the DC area several months ago she would have family very nearby. 

Unbeknownst to myself and my husband, at the time she applied to other schools as well. She preferred to attend the University of Maryland. We told her if she expected us to provide any financial support then it would be to a Catholic university. We were also disappointed she would choose this school over Georgetown, which had been so kind to her, and also never having toured this other school. Knowing this, she still wanted to attend University of Maryland. We told her she is an adult and we cannot controll her, but she will learn there are long term consequences to adult choices, namely student loans. 

I since learned she had cried of this issue to my brother, who offered to pay for all of her tuition. He has no children of his own and he contributes nothing to the care of our elderly parents. I texted him and explicitly asked him not to do this because my daughter needs to learn she will not always be rescued. He not only told me it’s his money and he will do whatever he “damn well pleases” with it, but he also told me my lesson is “an absolute joke.” We got into a heated argument over this, and I told him I am concerned about his influence over my daughter as he has been an atheist for decades, among other issues, and my daughter looks up to him immensely… College is already a difficult time for faith… He told me I’m not helping that by “alienating her.” I tried to be civil and urged him to consider my plea to which he replied he “doesn’t need to consider it.” 

There is now considerable tension between us, and with my daughter. Am I in the wrong for wanting to help guide her into adulthood? ",Asshole,2024-07-09,"AITA for asking my brother not to pay my daughter’s university tuition, as it was a deliberate consequence of her choices?

176,1dypprw,AITA for telling my girlfriend about issues with my friends,"I (19M) started dating my girlfriend (18F) 5 months ago. We've been going at it strong, we really connected and have been inseparable ever since we met. I've also been quite busy with work, college and I've gotten quite sick around 3 times in the past 2 months, so I've seen my friends less than usual. We're 10 guys in our friend group so me being missing a couple of times shouldn't be a big problem. 

However, my closest friend told me about how two of my other friends were constantly complaining about me ""sharing everything about them with my girlfriend"". For context, I really haven't told her much more about my friends since they really aren't that interesting for me to be constantly talking about them, they're funny and important in my life but not my whole focus and I have no reason to tell her about their private matters. Despite that, they kept bitching about it behind my back and I just ignored it.

Recently, 3 of my friends (2 of them were the ones who talked about me behind my back) cornered another of my closest friends and confronted him about showing a group chat discussion we had to a friend of his who is outside the group. They told him he had ""betrayed the groups trust"" and that ""now they were afraid to talk cause who knows what else he might share"". Once I learnt about this I confronted them, I was pissed off cause they said he had betrayed the groups trust without even asking the rest of the group. I also defended him venting about that discussion since it got really heated and I believe there's nothing wrong on sharing a conversation you were involved with as long as it doesn't include someone else's secret, which it didn't. They told me ""whatever happens in the group, stays in the group"" and said ""nothing should be shared outside"". I called that ""cultist behaviour"" and they called me an asshole. 

I wanted to tell my girlfriend because this has me pretty shook up but I felt guilty and didn't end up telling her because I didn't want to be the asshole by breaking their trust, but I don't really believe sharing this with my girlfriend is a big deal, after all she is the person I'm closest with. Do I just not understand how friendship works? Am I the asshole?
