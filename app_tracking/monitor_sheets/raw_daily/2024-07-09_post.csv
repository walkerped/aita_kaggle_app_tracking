0,1dyy4e7,AITA for not inviting my sister's wife to a family event because of her previous comments on my son?,"My husband Sam (39M) and I (39F) are celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary via inviting our family members for dinner. We decided we just wanted to be surrounded by the people we love.

I love my sister Charlotte (35F) very much. However, her wife Kate (38F) has never really fit in with our family. We all love and respect her of course, but just for context most of the misfit stems from her being a consevative lawyer and marrying into our super-liberal family.

Now I usually would definitely invite Kate to this event, along with Charlotte and their kids. However, during our last family dinner at my parents' house she made rude comments abiut my 18 y/o identifying as non-binary. Kate insisted she was still a she, that this whole thing is made-up, etc. She ultimately stopped her comments by Charlotte's intervention but I doubt her views have changed.

Now because of how she insulted my kid, and how hypocritical I think it is of her to be mardied to a woman and still say these things, I decided not to invite her and only invite my sister and their kids.

Ever since the invitations have been sent, Charlotte is very mad, and says she would mot attend the party, nor would their kids, unless I apologize and invite Kate too. I explained how her behavior affected my kid and they were very deeply hurt. And I pointed out how Kate never apologized. Charlotte is usually a sensible person but I would be lying if I said Kate's behavior hasn't rubbed on her a bit

We are both from same country, currently residing in foreign country and we become connected through mutual friends three years ago. We became quite close as we bonded through our homesickness and also other struggles of living outside your home country.

Over 3 years, I have become to know that she has a lot of childhood trauma, family issues and also relationship issues as she shared a lot of stories about these to me. At the early stages of our friendship, when she first shared about these trauma, I just listened and try to give some words of support. I also felt close to her as I thought she trusted me to share her inner feeling. However, after hanging out many times, I realized we do not have a lot of interests or views in common. But she is always kind to me and often take cares of me like a big sis so I felt attached to her.

However, since last year, I decided to distance myself from her a little as I was getting uncomfortable listening to her problems with her bf (mainly bf's immature personality and cheating). When she first talked about it, I was always on her side and agreeing she should move on but the situation became awkward, when she get back together with him and this repeated three or four times during the years since I have known her. So I decided not to involve in her dating matter at all. But the situation has become worse currently when she shared her news of keeping pregnancy with that bf but he threatens to leave her while they both know she needs his support on childcare.

I felt conflicted as I know she is going through really difficult time and I am the only friend she can talk to about this but also I know that I, a broke college student, don't have ability and resources to help her navigate this situation and she won't respond to me when i try to give her solutions.

Whenever he drinks I try my best to stay away from him by any means necessary, whether it be staying on the main floor with my grandparents and aunt, as he's usually in the basement watching TV (and drinking.) Whenever he's intoxicated he inconveniently wants to hang out with me because he wants an ally because none of my family is on his side, and I've made it clear that I'm not, either, because his recent behavior has been toxic and manipulative.

He has also said some incredibly rude things like ""you're fucking stupid"" and ""sometimes I wish you weren't my son"" thinking for whatever reason that it isn't unacceptable to say things like that.

Last night, he tried to get me to watch a movie with him. I politely declined his offer, but he then proceeded to threaten me, saying he'd force me to go to bed if I didn't comply. I told my grandmother about this, and he literally lied to everyone saying that he said ""you can watch a movie with me, OR you can do whatever you'd like until it's time for bed."" To stabilize the situation, my grandparents and aunt, despite knowing he was lying, said that he probably misspoke and didn't mean what he said, and the situation ended there, and I was not forced into watching a movie with him.

9,1dyomy4,AITA for asking my sister to delete pictures of my face from her social medias?,"Me (13) my mom, and my dad just got back home from visiting my sister (26) and her boyfriend. We are half siblings and we live halfway across the country from them.

A few days before we left, we wanted to take pictures, as we usually do. So we took some and I hate them. I didn’t smile or whatever, I just don’t like the way I look in them. My mom (unlike my sister) asked me if she could make one of the pics her profile picture and I said no, so she didn’t. My sister, however, was extremely rude.

Once we had gotten home, I saw her snap story and it had 2 pictures that I just happened to be in. I asked her nicely if she could remove them and I told her that I didn’t want them up there. She said “It’ll be gone soon it’s fine” and I told her how she didn’t ask for our permission (me, mom and dad were in those pics).

A few days later, which is today, I saw her Facebook post. It had 3 pictures of me, my mom, and my dad in them, and I was in 2 of them. I had politely asked her to take them down and I said how I don’t want them up there in the first place and how she didn’t ask (once again). She told me “I don’t need permission to post what I want on my own social media. Relax dude.”

I said how that’s insensitive to my feelings, and that it’s my face that I don’t want up there. She said she’s not going to fight with me, so I told her to delete them. She of course said no, so I turned it around and pulled one of their cards, which is “it makes me uncomfortable”. Her and her bf ALWAYS say this and express their feelings/opinions when they’re uncalled for, but I can’t have these feelings? Like wtf?

She then said how she “wouldn’t be bossed around, sorry” when all I did was NICELY ask her to remove a few pictures. I told her that if she was sorry she’d delete them. She wasn’t going to respond to me anymore unless the topic changed, she said. I just told her flat out “I don’t fucking want them up there”.

My sister texted my mom about it first. “I’m not arguing with your child, do something about it”. Mother said how my feelings are valid and the conversation is over. We are both ignoring her now. She texted me and asked if I was texting her off my mom’s phone, and she asked the same thing to my mom.

Mom powered off her phone and before that, told my dad about it kinda. I also told him. I sent a screenshot to him of me and my sister’s conversation.

My sister is a therapist. Keep that in mind. That cannot go well for her patients.

TLDR; Sister posted pictures of me, my mom, and dad on Snap and Facebook, was being rude about it for no reason, and refusing to delete them once asked nicely multiple times and told how I felt about it. She never asked to post them in the first place.

10,1dyojhp,AITA for not reconciling with my father?,"AITA for not reconciling with my father?(Posted this 8 months ago and thought id give an update at the bottom! thank you all again for the support on the original post!

(sorry for any typos and poor formatting im typing this on my phone)

For context I(20f) and my dad (45?m) got into a pretty large fight a couple months back. We have had a pretty strained relationship since my mom left him and got remarried.. 

My dad and I argued constantly argued.As On my two days off I would go out and spend time with my boyfriend. Im a full time college student and have a full time job. ive never been wild child. We would argue about me not being home often. he wasnt either because he worked out of town.

Fast forward to about 5 months ago our arguments started turning into how he was upset that I would go spend time with my mother once or twice a week or spend the night there. she has custody of my little sister and recently had a baby with her husband so the only time I got to see them is when i would go over there. He hated my mother for leaving him and said I was being disloyal to him by actively trying to be around her and her new husband. 

at the beginning of August he took the car he gave me for graduation to prevent me from going to my moms. This caused me to miss some college classes almost resulting in me getting dropped from classes, missing some work which luckily my bosses were like family so they understood and helped me get rides. And i was told to figure out how I was going to get around, luckily my boyfriends mom allowed me to use her car. Shortly after this i was at my moms and he was out town, and he called me absolutely losing his mind that i had been at my moms (he had me on life 360) and told me to get my shit and figure it out. 

In a lot of our arguments he has said this to me and i would constantly beg him to reconsider but this time i was done, i replied ok and hung up. i asked my mom if i could move in woth her to which she said i could and called my boyfriend to help me move out and that same night i started packing my things. 

Within 3 days i was out. A couple weeks went by and i remembered my name was on the utilities.I got ahold of his girlfriend and let her know i would be taking my name off but tell the companies to leave them on a week in order to give them time to get it in their name so they didnt go without power or water. When i did this he called my mother absolutely losing his mind calling me vindictive and saying i was only doing this to get back at him. He also stated i better give him any deposits i get back from them, i told him i wouldnt be doing that as i paid the initial deposits when he couldnt and he never gave me the money back for them so i would be keeping the leftover. 

Now to the initial point of the post, some of my family think im being childish and petty for not trying to work things out with him and better our relationship. they think i should be the bigger person and apologize for taking my name off the utilities and try to reconcile. So AITA for not doing that?


UPDATE! 
So its been 8 months since all this has happened, and i just wanted to say thank you to everyones input! my relationship with my dad is still complicated, although we are slightly talking again, i still have not met up with him in person because im trying to keep boundaries as he is very manipulative and i know if i go see him in person its likely ill get sucked back into the bs as im a bit of a pushover when it comes to him. Ive been seeing a therapist and she thinks its a good idea to keep distance. Two months ago he called me asking me to essentially commit a felony for him (cant really get into that) and then tried to gaslight and manipulate me into doing it after i said no, i almost caved but luckily my boyfriend talked some sense into me. We didnt talk for a few weeks after that but are now. Although its difficult because whenever i try to give him little life updates on things going on he seems very uninterested and inconvenienced by the conversation. I also graduated college with my associates in may (it was a 2 year) and although i told him the date and time 2 months prior he said he would make it and then texted me two days before saying he couldnt get out of work and didnt come. So things are still rough with us and ik i should cut contact at this point but hes my dad and i love him so its been really hard to do so.

11,1dyoi1e,AITAH for not giving up my bedroom at a vacation home for my brothers step kids?,"Apologies for how long this is in advance. 

I(20f) am on vacation with some of my family at my mom’s vacation home. The family pertaining to this story includes myself, my mom, my brother, my brother’s wife, my niece(11f) and my brother’s two stepsons (6m and 8m). They also have an infant together, so 4 children total. Infant is staying in brother and sil room. Sil’s sons are difficult children. They are mouthy, do not listen, and she does not make an effort to control them. They also have intentionally hurt my dog(pulling her fur, pinching her, etc..) But that’s bedsides the point. 

My mom’s cabin has 4 bedrooms total. The master(my moms room), downstairs bedroom one(my room), downstairs bedroom two(brother and his wife’s room), and then a smaller bedroom that adjoins to the bedrooms my brother is in, where the kids are staying. The adjoining bedroom has a futon that my niece is sleeping on, and an air mattress that belongs to my mom that sil’s sons are sleeping on.

Arrangement worked fine for the first week we were here. But yesterday, I walked past the room the kids are in and saw the two boys jumping on the air mattress and trying to launch each other. I popped my head in and was like “hey don’t do that you’ll break it.” They ignored me. Later that day the two boys come running into the living room saying the air mattress had a hole in it. What a surprise.

Obviously the mattress deflated and is now unusable. I figured the kids would all share the futon or assumed their mom would figure it out, since her sons were the ones that broke the mattress in the first place. 

I overheard my sil talking to my brother saying that I should have offered to give up my room for her boys. She said I could easily sleep with my mom and now her sons have nowhere to sleep because I “was selfish and rude.” I’m genuinely shocked, nobody asked for my bedroom, was I supposed to read her mind? And no part of me wants to share a bed with my mom because her children are out of control and can’t listen. Why should I have to? I said nothing and acted like I never overheard the conversation. The 3 kids ended up all staying on the futon, zero issues and they seemed fine doing that. I stayed in my room. 

The mood is just soured now, even though sil doesn’t know I heard her saying that. She’s acting rude towards me. 

TLDR: My brothers stepsons busted the air they were sleeping on at my mom’s vacation home. My sil got pissed at me because I did not offer my bedroom to them. 

So, AITAH for not offering to give my bedroom to the two boys?

However a year later, clearly she got comfortable(a bit too comfortable). I figured because we were close I'd tell her about past wrong things i did and regretted. At that time i had liked a guy in our friend group who also liked me back. We weren't together but yeah anyways he and i got a bit akward after i had to tell him that i wasnt allowed to date anyone out of my relgion. I don't know what went through her head but she started bringing up things about my in the past infront of him. Calling me a hoe and stuff. I grew up with guys so i had alot of guy friends but for some reason she found it necessary to point that out everytime saying "" watch she again, goin' fuh man."" it got really uncomfortable being around her also considering the fact that she had a 'friend' who she didnt like bc she was a pick me but she was only 'friends' with her because she wanted to attend her birthday party. i got uncomfortable knowing how fake she was infront her then act like she was her nemisis behind her back. idk if i was jus paranoid but i had a feeling she was doing that to me aswell especially with how she was acting around the same boy i had like. (mind you after telling her gay bestfriend not to get with a guy bc he's so bad and ugly . she got with the guy and broke up with him after a week bc she didnt see the spark anymore) i started ignoring her after failed attempts of trying to explain to her that i wasnt comfortable with her saying those things. after about 2-3 weeks she sent the boy i liked to ask me what was wrong. i told him and he escorted me to her were we had a whole arguement about it. i brought up what she had done to the boy who liked her and she had the audacity to say ""keep him and me out ah yuh mouth. that is not your business"" (not even to say i found out about it, she told me all about him and her delusions she had) i was honestly shocked that she would say that after all the terrible lies she said about me. then she had the audacity to say i called her a hoe(i didnt) and then say everything she did was a joke. she didnt even think about how i would feel she jus laughed and said it was a joke.

We became close and we'd do things high school friends would do. However a year later, clearly she got comfortable(a bit too comfortable). I figured because we were close I'd tell her about past wrong things i did and regretted. At that time i had liked a guy in our friend group who also liked me back. We weren't together but yeah anyways he and i got a bit akward after i had to tell him that i wasnt allowed to date anyone out of my relgion. I don't know what went through her head but she started bringing up things about my in the past infront of him. Calling me a hoe and stuff. I grew up with guys so i had alot of guy friends but for some reason she found it necessary to point that out everytime saying "" watch she again, goin' fuh man."" it got really uncomfortable being around her also considering the fact that she had a 'friend' who she didnt like bc she was a pick me but she was only 'friends' with her because she wanted to attend her birthday party. i got uncomfortable knowing how fake she was infront her then act like she was her nemisis behind her back. idk if i was jus paranoid but i had a feeling she was doing that to me aswell especially with how she was acting around the same boy i had like. (mind you after telling her gay bestfriend not to get with a guy bc he's so bad and ugly . she got with the guy and broke up with him after a week bc she didnt see the spark anymore) i started ignoring her after failed attempts of trying to explain to her that i wasnt comfortable with her saying those things. after about 2-3 weeks she sent the boy i liked to ask me what was wrong. i told him and he escorted me to her were we had a whole arguement about it. i brought up what she had done to the boy who liked her and she had the audacity to say ""keep him and me out ah yuh mouth. that is not your business"" (not even to say i found out about it, she told me all about him and her delusions she had) i was honestly shocked that she would say that after all the terrible lies she said about me. then she had the audacity to say i called her a hoe(i didnt) and then say everything she did was a joke. she didnt even think about how i would feel she jus laughed and said it was a joke. Long story short i dropped her ass and i havnt talked to her in months.
