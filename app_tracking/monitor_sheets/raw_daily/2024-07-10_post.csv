0,1dzjdmt,AITA for charging family member rent? ,"So in January I let my wives cousin move into the home.  She told a story of emotional and verbal abuse from her mother and talked of deep dark thoughts while living with her.  She is 25, never held a real job.   I said yes because I'm a good person and believe family should help family. When we agreed to it we told said cousin she'd have to get a full time job, learn to drive, and contribute to the household by way of doing simple things like cleaning up a little and come summer a small amount of rent. She agreed

Shortly after we find out she never finished high school and it was causing issues looking for work. Ok no problem, worked with her and she finished her GED in April.  She then acquired a job that pays $9/hr 10-20 hours a month.   

We told her work that until she finds something else so she has some work experience.  During this time she's preparing to get her license.   That happens in a week.   We talked with her last month about the search for full time work.  My wife sent her job postings and she doesn't apply.   She's above retail, food service, gas stations, ect.   Dad is paying her bills and mom is trying to buy her love back during this time

We talked with her in the start of June again about finding a full-time job.  She kinda shrugged it off. At the same time we told her come August we would be charging $400 a month for rent.  She gets full access to the house, we pay for everything, including her food and personal products. She uses far more toilet paper and hot water than the average person we know.  She kind of shrugged it off again. 

This weekend we were told we were the AHs because we're going to be charging her rent. Honestly if she were to show some effort we probably would push the due date by a month or two to let her save some money but there is zero want to work it seems. 

Her mother who has basically said we're strangers she lives with and nothing more said we should just be happy she's working at all. Her dad is burned out from many years of drugs and drinking (he drank and hit drugs heavily in the 70s/80s) and doesn't want anything to do with it except for the unknown amount of money he gives her monthly that is supposed to go towards her maxed out credit cards.   We were gone for a few days and 4x a day there was a door dash delivery at the house despite having left her with a full fridge, freezer and pantry. 

AITA for standing firm with the demand for rent and telling her she can sign a lease agreement or she can find other housing arrangements? I feel like we're being taken advantage of at this point. Despite providing her with everything she doesn't clean, unload dishwasher, or even clean her massive piles of hair from the shower drain.  She just expects us to do it.

1,1dzjcoc,AITA family drama teens,"Two of my children (14&16) spent the weekend at my MILs with their 2 cousins (17&18) I happened to go there to their house with my other child (7) the next day. When I was leaving, my MIL tells me she’s going to send me a text there’s something I should be aware of. 

I got in the car and read the message: it is basically saying the 17 year old cousin started crying to “Nan” because of a video she saw on my sons phone, and she stated it has my 14 year old daughter making a derogatory remark about the 17 year olds body. And that I need to address this, this has to stop and that video needs to be deleted. 

I questioned my kids together and saw the video. Conclusion from the video: Neither of my children were there( i know this for a fact), it was a video my son recieved through text from a friend, and there’s NOTHING said about the 17year olds body in it at all by anyone. 

I texted back to my MIL and tell her that. My kids were both with me that day, they weren’t there and sent her the video so she could see for herself there was nothing negative said about the 17year old at all. 

After sending this, my MIL says she’s going to confront the 17 year old to get to the bottom of this, and now she claims she never believed what she was told anyways. However, she would like to wait until the 17year old is alone (first crying conversation was had in front of the 18year old cousin and Nan told them both she was going to look into it.) But my daughter is very upset that her Nan would think/believe she would act like that. 

Fast forward a few days and it comes up again in text form and Nan now says she’s decided not to confront the 17year old. She just doesn’t want to get in the middle of it anymore. 

I’m so upset over this. My take: MIL was so quick to accuse 14 year of trash talking her cousin, but when the facts are shown, MIL decides to bow out of situation and let the 17year old basically trash talk my daughter to the rest of our family.

2,1dzj7xk,AITA for reporting my neighbor for laundry room shenanigans?,"So, earlier today I (40ish, NB) decided to do laundry. It's in the basement of the sub-building, and it's only 1 washer and 1 dryer. I've lived here for years and have gotten used to putting 2 or 3 loads through in one run so that they just get done and I'm not down there every other day for this. It's never been a problem.

A few months ago, the whole sub-building (one of MANY in this complex) got printed letters from property management about ""leaving your laundry in the machines all day"" or something. I didn't think anything of it at the time bc I don't do that.

Every now & then the machine has an error bc the front-loading washer door won't lock properly, therefore it won't start (bc it would leak). I didn't notice, went up, came back down 30 mins later to push the next load in, saw the error on the machine. I got it going, reset my timer, went back up. Came back down 30 mins later to find my stuff pulled out & flopped wet on top of the folding counter, a pink basket in front of the washer, & my other load/basket shoved aside.

Rude.

It's mid-day on a Tuesday, so I thought I was out of the way. I put my stuff into the dryer & went back up. I was confused & a little unsettled that someone just entitled themselves to doing that. I wrote a polite (no really, it was polite) note explaining that I would happily have let them get their load through real quick in between mine, if they had simply asked. I also noted that I'm not mad, but that I really don't appreciate my stuff being touched/moved & I'd never do that to someone else, & that I would've warned them about the washer door & shown them the work-around if they had just asked.  
  
It did the same thing to her, and I wondered if she's aggro enough to just throw my stuff around, she's probably aggro enough to blame me for the machine acting up or just be all nasty in my face if she saw me.  
  
I'm moderately disabled, w/ severe PTSD, & not confident I could defend myself in a throwdown. So I sat texting my leasing agent to ask her how she'd handle it. We're friends w the maintenance team, so I asked if a guy could like, hang out so I could get my stuff w/o incident. He stopped by, & I did so.

She came back down, I heard her cursing/slamming the machine, then walking away w/ my note. I peeped which apt she went back to, texted the LA back, & she said she'd address it. I'll just do the rest of mine later this week or w/e.

I'm pretty sure, per the timing when she would have moved in, that she's the reason we all got that letter. And that's not the only letter we've all gotten (noise, dogs, parking, mail, etc.) Like, do people not know that more than 1 load of laundry is like, very normal? Did she think I was lazy & left my stuff?

I can't tell if I'm the AH for like, wanting to do 2 loads consecutively, mid-day like this? Or for leaving a quick note to clarify? AITA for making the LA aware? I really really hate snitches. But even my dad was like, ""yeah she sounds like a Karen"".

I am now getting grief every time. I've used different sprays. I've used ozium. I have done everything I can. Yet she still complains about it constantly.

The kicker is I'm moving out permanently before the end of the month. Two and a half weeks, last Sunday of July.

I have been having some issues with my bank and therefore was unable to access my account, which I let her know when she invited me out. I told her I'd pay her back as soon as possible, and she agreed that was fine. While we were at dinner, she mentioned that one of our other close friends (22F) had yet to pay her back a substantial amount after a weekend the two of them had spent in Chicago. I promised I would be more prompt.

A week or so later, she texted to remind me. I assured her that it was still on my mind, and that I would pay her the moment my issues were fixed with my checking account. I suggested she request the amount I owed on Venmo, so that it would be certain I wouldn't forget. She agreed, and that was the last we spoke about it.

A couple days after that, my issues were fixed and I was finally able to access my account. I went to my Venmo requests and saw that the amount she had asked for was about ten dollars higher than the total of my meal. I texted her about this, asking politely if there was something I was forgetting, assuring her that I would pay the full amount she'd requested if that was how much I actually owed. She never responded to this (and even left me on read) so I honestly forgot about it after sending the text.

This morning, news made it back to me that she has been mentioning to some of our other friends that she's annoyed at me for not paying her back, especially after she told me about how frustrated she was with our other friend for forgetting about payment too. I was pretty confused by this, as she never responded to me when I asked her to clarify the payment amount.

6,1dziwgt,WIBTA for sending my autistic cousin to day camp?,"Let’s call my dad Dad and my cousin Cousin. PLEASE don’t judge my dad, he is doing his absolute best  

I (21F) and my dad (45M) have been taking care of my cousin (17F) for the past two years while her bio parents sort out some mental health and other things. Dad is a trucker so he can be gone for up to a few days at a time. I have my own issues with some trauma I’m working through (family on my mom's side is kind of wild) but Cousin aged out of foster and we live many hours drive away from mom's side and dad's side is on another continent (Dad is an immigrant) so our only choice was to take Cousin in. I love Cousin to death and have been taking care of her since we were kids because at one point we lived together in kinship care, it’s a long complicated situation but basically we're technically cousins but more like half siblings. 

Anyway, so Dad is the primary income. I have a summer job but it’s part time (20 hours weekly) and minimum wage. In the meantime I do the cooking, cleaning, etc. We basically live like a 50s nuclear household but without all the nasty fifties treatment I can’t name here. So like, I do cooking, cleaning, entertaining guests (mostly Cousin's friends), and Dad does yard work, budget, income, driving, etc.. We had a good setup for awhile because by pure coincidence Dad was always home whenever I was at work last year and so Cousin wasn’t alone. This year isn’t the case. I started college, I’m still working, and it’s really adding up. I gained 2 inches on my stomach in less than a month. My hair is falling out. I am extremely stressed. 

Cousin is autistic. She doesn’t know how to cook or clean even though I’ve showed her a billion times. I feel bad asking her to clean because when I lived with my mom (age 5-14) I was basically the maid. I don’t want Cousin to have this experience like I did. So I set up activities for her, cook her food, clean her dishes, et cetera. I tried to think, ""okay it’s not her fault, just be as kind and loving as you can possibly be"" but then people accuse me of coddling her, treating her like a baby, and hindering her potential. 

There is a day camp in my area age 14-18. Cousin hates loud noises and wears noise canceling headphones. She hates being in wet clothes. She can’t deal with the sun unless she’s wearing one very specific outfit. She doesn’t eat many things. She has a special diet of things she'll eat. I have to remind her bathroom, water, etc.. Day camp would be absolute HELL for her. At the same time, Dad does not have the time to be caring for her at the same level as I do. I am absolutely stressed and I need some time where I can take care of ME and not someone else. There are literally no options other than 1 week day camp 9am-4pm to give me a little vacation. It would be t0rture for her, it’s everything she hates, but I NEED my me time so bad. It’s between that and me literally walking away for a week — which is neglect as she can’t care for herself.

7,1dziiad,AITA for refusing to go camping for more than 4 days?  ,"I’ve never been camping, I’m severely allergic to mosquitos, have stomach problems and I just generally like being within the comfort of my house.

Both our birthdays are coming up next week and since we’re long distance, we planned to meet in his city, I asked what he wants to do for his birthday and he said camping so we’re going camping.

10,1dzi7wn,AITA for bringing up a past situation when in an argument with my mother?,"**I'm using a throwaway here.**

***CONTEXT:*** My (**15f**) mother (**53f**) has a history of bad relationships. Her first husband ran out with their money, and her second husband (my father) wasn't a nice man at all. Her current partner (**60m**) is *controlling*. At the beginning it was fine; he was very strict but it wasn't *anger*. Then an incident happened in 2021 where he was convinced I had done something I hadn't and he completely ignored me for two months straight. Since then we have moved to a different country and Step-dad has been amicable since the incident but is incredibly petty. Example; If I make him a tea that has too much sugar? He has to drink mine as punishment. If I finish some food when he wanted it? I'm a 'leech' that is burning through his money. If I don't smile at him in the morning? I am being purposefully rude. If I admit that I feel upset by these things? I am being divisive.

**Yesterday** I got in an argument with my mum when she brought up inviting my cousin (15m) over to visit.

Cousin is someone who my mum has never liked. He was a very angry boy and I often had the task of caring for him when his own mum didn't. Due to this we are very close - more like brother and sister. The problem with him visiting is that she has already talked of cousin to step-dad who has expressed his distaste.

Cousin may not be prone to talking back, but he is still pretty defiant when told to act a certain way or not to. And, as you may have gathered, step-dad will not be able to handle any kind of defiance. I admit I can be a pushover when it comes to adults but cousin **is not**.

I expressed my hesitance to bring cousin over - saying that I was worried something could kick off. Mum defended step-dad and said that if cousin doesn't ""act like a little cunt"" that he won't bristle.

I argued back. I didn't shout, but I pushed my distaste for her words and that it isn't *him* who I am worried about. Mum continued to reiterate her point; that she doesn't see a problem with cousin coming over if I can tell her that he won't act out. I was confused that my words weren't registering, but she seemed hell-bent on cousin being the instigator.

And then what I was saying clicked and she got angry-which ended in me *actually* getting angry and arguing over how step-dad treats us. She said to me that when she talks to me about her relationships, that she is showing me that she trusts me- that she is on my side and will endanger her relationship and happiness for me.

And so I say without thinking;

""Well that wasn't the case in 2021 was it?""

And today she won't talk to me.

I feel bad for bringing it up when no one has mentioned it since, but all I could think of was how step-dad was back then while she watched. Her saying *that* felt like it ripped out the stitches on a wound that hasn't healed.

11,1dzi009,AITA for calling my uncle a small man?,"For a bit of backstory, I (25M) worked for my mom's sister's husband Jim (57?M) 7 years ago. I couldn't find an internship for the summer after my freshman year of college. I reached out to Jim who said I could apply for his company's intern position. I was accepted and Jim said I could live with him for the summer and borrow one of his cars since he lives in a different state. I was super thankful for the opportunity + housing and pretty excited because Jim was always known as the cool, charismatic uncle. But the summer was a bit of a nightmare. I learned Jim is feared and hated as a CEO. He's a huge micromanager and changes expectations on a whim which makes weeks of hard work useless. 


I wasn't spared as an intern. I was assigned a vaguely specified project that I was way under-qualified and underpaid for. Two weeks before my internship ended we had a check-in where he yelled at me and went back on a lot of his initial requirements. I put in 80 hour weeks for the rest of my time to salvage my project and make Jim happy. Jim was also a dick to live with. I was more than happy to do chores and help around but he treated me like a servant. But the worst incident was with the car he lent me. It had a busted bumper before I ever sat down in the driver's seat. I figured it caused by one of his alcoholic friends who he routinely lends his cars to. He eventually noticed the damage, blamed me for it, and forced me to pay for repairs. Oh well, lesson learned, take pictures of stuff you rent or borrow as insurance.


Even though my internship ended years ago, that summer really soured my opinion on Jim. We also later found out that he had a suspect relationship with one of the young HR girls at his company so my mom dislikes him too. But my aunt eventually worked through it with Jim. 


Anyways, my parents had a small family reunion and my aunt brought Jim so we had to put up with him for the weekend. Jim decided to spend the weekend fucking with our small elderly dog. Sliding her pad while she's sleeping, blowing air in her face, pretending like he was gonna give her table food then eating it himself, taking her toys and hiding them out of her reach, snapping in her face, etc. After Jim slid her pad again and laughed at her looking sad and pissed off, I said something like ""I guess the small man has to bully the small dog to feel better about himself"" (he's 5'6). He looked at me with a confused look and I followed up by saying that she isn't one of his [company] employees and she isn't paid to put up with his shit and be tormented by him. Long story short, my aunt said she couldn't believe how disrespectful I was after everything Jim has done for me.

14,1e0atva,AITA for asking if family events could be a little later in the day?,"My husband (36M) and I (38F) live in a major US city and have for 8 years. Thankfully, it’s one state over from our home state, so visiting family is doable.

My problem is our families never take us into account when it comes to planning visits. Birthdays, holidays, parties, picnics, you name it, they will schedule it at whatever time on whatever day. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve gotten shock, annoyance, and guilt trips when we say we can’t make it to something because it’s a bad time or day for us, even though we’re often told last minute.

For big holidays and birthdays, we have to rent a car; this isn’t a car city, so we don’t own one. I am also disabled, so I can’t help get suitcases, piles of presents and our dog through a train station. As far as said disability, sitting in a car in city traffic, often turning a 1 hour 40 minute car ride into a 3-4 hour car ride, sucks for my back. If the event is especially early, we have to come up the night before, which equally sucks because none of our relatives have a guest bedroom, so we have to sleep on a blow up mattress. When it comes to my chronic pain, that also sucks. We can’t afford hotels, so it’s just something we have to do.

I bring up all this up just to paint the picture of what each trip home looks like for us and maybe why I reacted the way I did after 8 years of this. 

I have mentioned twice over these 8 years that a time chosen for an event wasn’t very convenient, asking if it couldn’t be later, that we have to travel a decent distance. My sister (36F) gave me grief both times I’ve mentioned it, yelling, being snide, giving the silent treatment. This is why I mostly keep these thoughts to myself. I hate fighting, confrontation, and people being mad at me; I’ve always felt this way and it gives me severe anxiety. Besides this, she cannot argue her point while listening to someone else argue theirs, therefore it’s never productive, it’s never something we “hash out”, so I don’t see the point.

My niece has her 1st birthday party this Sunday. I joked with my sister “it had to be at 11:00am?” She lost it on me, saying that’s the only time it could be, that 3:00pm (after the baby’s nap time) is too late for a one year old’s birthday (not sure why). She then rapid fire texted me things like “you always do this”, “I can’t believe you don’t want to come to your niece’s milestone birthday” (I never said anything like that). I told her I didn’t think it was a big deal to mention it, that it’d just be nice if things like this could start a little later- she shut me down and told me she was done talking about it.

She has anxiety and she gets wound up over a lot, but I didn’t think it was an out of pocket  thing to bring up. It would be nice to occasionally hear “I know you’re coming a long way, sorry it had to be so early”. Does that make me an asshole?

Am I an asshole for mentioning it?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA for asking if family events could be a little later in the day? My husband (36M) and I (38F) live in a major US city and have for 8 years. Thankfully, it’s one state over from our home state, so visiting family is doable.

My problem is our families never take us into account when it comes to planning visits. Birthdays, holidays, parties, picnics, you name it, they will schedule it at whatever time on whatever day. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve gotten shock, annoyance, and guilt trips when we say we can’t make it to something because it’s a bad time or day for us, even though we’re often told last minute.

For big holidays and birthdays, we have to rent a car; this isn’t a car city, so we don’t own one. I am also disabled, so I can’t help get suitcases, piles of presents and our dog through a train station. As far as said disability, sitting in a car in city traffic, often turning a 1 hour 40 minute car ride into a 3-4 hour car ride, sucks for my back. If the event is especially early, we have to come up the night before, which equally sucks because none of our relatives have a guest bedroom, so we have to sleep on a blow up mattress. When it comes to my chronic pain, that also sucks. We can’t afford hotels, so it’s just something we have to do.

16,1e0aatp,AITA for allowing my friend to propose at my graduation party?,"I (18F) just recently graduated high school in May. The summer has been so busy so I haven’t been able to have a graduation party until last weekend. My mom (45F) and her friend pulled out all the stops: taco bar, cute decorations, and games as well as putting together an Amazon registry for my dorm room! It was truly amazing, except for one minor hiccup. 

A few days before the party, I get a text from a super close family friend, Max (21M) asking if he could propose to his girlfriend (who also happens to be my cousin) Bri (22F) at the party. I absolutely ADORE them as a couple and I have always seen Max and Bri as the older siblings I never had, so of course I was overjoyed at the impending engagement and the fact that Max wanted to incorporate my event into a small aspect of their story. So of course, I gave him the go ahead! 

Cut to last Saturday, after we went outside of the venue for pictures, Max took a knee and popped the question. She said yes, and because we were already outside for pictures, we got some gorgeous shots of the proposal. 

Everyone was overjoyed, except my mother and her friend (the one who helped her plan the party) who pulled me and Max aside, infuriated, and said that the party was supposed to be about me entering into a new stage in my life, and they didn’t plan the party for Max and Bri, and they were stealing my thunder, and that this was on par with proposing at a wedding, and that this was just plain tacky.

Max apologized, but I said that I gave him permission and that yes, this is my party so I want to celebrate with my family and friends who are also about to enter into a new chapter of life! However, my mom said I didn’t plan the party so it’s not technically mine so Max should have asked them instead of me.

My husband had 3 kids before we got together. His oldest my stepson Brian (15M) is a total daddy's boy. He wants to spend all his time at his dad's even when it's his mom's week. Anytime he has a fight with his mom or Stepdad he's running over to ours to cuddle up to his dad with his head in my husband's lap while he comforts him.. Anytime he's upset about anything or had a really bad day etc he needs dad time. His other kids  at 13 and 11 aren't like this and hell even our ,5 yr old isnt as bad.

Brian apparently got broken up with yesterday and I came home from work to find him cuddled up to my husband crying into his lap. I decided maybe I should say something.After Brian fell asleep after a while and my husband got up I asked him if maybe he was babying Brian to much. He goes what did I mean and I tell him that Brian sometimes acts like a little kid with him for example today. He tells me thats not fair that Brian's 1st boyfriend just broke up with him.  I tell him exactly he's a boy he's supposed to be out with his boys getting over this other kid not cuddled up to his dad like a little kid.

He tells me there's nothing wrong with comforting his kid. I ask him what would Brian's football or wrestling teammates think and how embarrassed he'd be if they found out.

19,1e0a4wt,AITA for telling my wife her dad needs to be tested for dementia?,"
My father-in-law has a family history of dementia. His father used to exhibit odd behaviors like spray-painting his shoes gold. It’s very sad, and I’ve always felt for him.

I’ve known this man for ten years, and he’s always been very friendly. However, in the past two years, he’s been showing signs of decline: personality changes, confusion over simple documents, and increased wobbliness. He’s always been a bit unsteady due to an old injury, but this seems worse. Most notably, he’s become aggressive and argumentative.

The issue is, he refuses to get tested. His family has approached him, but he shuts them down. He’s an ex-pastor and a huge know-it-all, and his family caters to his every need. He has a 1950s mentality, expecting to be waited on, and his family lets him get away with it.

On top of this, my dad is dealing with terminal health issues, which has been extremely stressful. My dad has taken charge of his health since my mom passed away, so I have little patience for my father-in-law’s negligence regarding his mental decline.

Recently, my wife and I argued about a deed transfer that has taken my father-in-law over a year to complete, which I believe indicates his struggles. During the fight, I told her again that her dad needs to be tested. I have a co-worker whose mother-in-law is getting treatment for dementia, and it’s really slowed her progression. My wife said, “He won’t listen to us! You need to approach him!” Meanwhile, I’ve already confronted my dad about his health issues, and he’s now seeking treatment. Granted, my mom’s death prompted my dad to take action, but watching my father-in-law’s decline and inaction is very hard for me. It feels like we’ll be the ones caring for him when his mind goes, and it’s tough to say nothing.

I feel bad calling him out, but I’m mostly concerned for the safety of my three-year-old. Several times, my father-in-law, seemingly to annoy me, will pick up my son and wobble while holding him, physically shaking. I’m scared they’ll fall, and my son will get hurt. When I raised this concern, my father-in-law said, “Snatch him from me and don’t let me do that,” then he does it again, almost like he’s testing me. Afterward, he sends me weird texts saying how lucky he is to have a son-in-law who cares so much. The worst was when he pretended to sit on my son and his arms were shaking under his weight. I intervened, saying, “Stop! That’s so dangerous.” He left quickly, making it about how he misses his dead friends, and everyone consoled him while I stood there, shocked at the manipulation.

22,1e09s19,AITA if I say no to having a joint party,"Throwaway a/c

So in a few months I'm turning 30 and want something low key, a few friends, pints chats etc.

I'm in a group of 8 girls and we've been friends, some of us over 20 and collectively 17years.

4 of us are turning 30 in the same month. Two of them are having a joint get together. Myself and ""Aimee"" are the other 2.  Aimee suggested we also do a joint party. 

Now over the years Aimee hasn't treated me very well, nasty sly comments, undermining suggestions I make for the group, only asks to hang out after she's exhausted all avenues, and low key bullied me when we're kids. In the past it's always been me organising things from trips, parties etc but Aimee taking the glory and still throwing sly comments at these events. I would like to point out I do nothing to provoke these comments, they come from thin air when sometimes I'm not part of the direct conversation. Aimee suggested this a few months ago and out of politeness I said I would think about.

The other two girls that month just texted to ""save the date"" for their joint party and Aimee text me straight away to say we need to get planning ours. This is the first time she's brought it up since mentioning it months ago.

So in a few months I'm turning 30 and want something low key, a few friends, pints chats etc.

I'm in a group of 8 girls and we've been friends, some of us over 20 and collectively 17years.

4 of us are turning 30 in the same month. Two of them are having a joint get together. Myself and ""Aimee"" are the other 2.  Aimee suggested we also do a joint party. 

Now over the years Aimee hasn't treated me very well, nasty sly comments, undermining suggestions I make for the group, only asks to hang out after she's exhausted all avenues, and low key bullied me when we're kids. In the past it's always been me organising things from trips, parties etc but Aimee taking the glory and still throwing sly comments at these events. I would like to point out I do nothing to provoke these comments, they come from thin air when sometimes I'm not part of the direct conversation. Aimee suggested this a few months ago and out of politeness I said I would think about. She also said she she was claiming a particular day so whether I do it jointly or not she's having this particular day (our birthdays are 2 days apart) she wants  to book a space and have a big shindig and it's just so not me.

23,1e09pmj,AITA for no longer attending husband's families gathering,"DH's families have arranged an annual gathering every year. Previously, we stayed with everyone at the location of 400 miles from our home. We often left the gathering felt left out but a huge relieved it ended. 

We just had a little one not long ago. Last time we were there, it was for the sake of him to be around his cousins and the rest of my DH's family. 

This year we were promised to stay at his aunt's. Just few days ago, she changed her mind. We were left to find a rental accommodation at a last minute, considering the gathering will be during school summer holidays. 

Today I told DH that he should take our LO to this year gathering, without me. Recently DH solo travelled to see his dad who has been poorly and immobile for several years. He promised to bring our LO to his next visit. DH thinks it is not possible for him to manage a road trip of 400 miles alone with our toddler. 

DH and I married for 15 years. I (F 41) never feel I am being a part of his family. He (M 46) also admitted not being popular among his own crews. ( Even though we only see his families once a year, max) My DH and I agreed we are different kind of people comparing to his families, putting it mildly.

My argument, I left my hometown from another country two decades ago. DH and I had last seen my parents at our wedding. I made peace with myself about being so far away from my people, even before I had a child. LO never met my own parents or anyone on my side. When I pushed to make plan to visit them, DH would have excuses about our finances or other not valid reasons. He does not support my idea to travel, just me and LO. Neither, he wants to come with me. Ended up, LO and I have not travelled to visit my family. 

I spelled this out today to DH. He was disappointed. He insisted I should go on this trip, for LO's sake. He kept saying that he promised my FIL who potentially might pass away in few months. If I did not come to this gathering, he will miss this chance with his dad. 

I despise travel in the car for eight hours and have to put my LO through it. I have to spend two nights with people that do not appreciate our company or not acknowledging the effort we are putting in. I hate that DH made no effort for my family. 
I am not taking away a chance for LO to say farewell to his grandad. I just want DH to get on with his own family business.

24,1e09kse,AITA for not being there for my GF when her cousin passed away ,"M28/F26 my girlfriend & I went on vacation to a resort to celebrate our anniversary, the first day at the resort she got sloppy drunk by 6pm, while she was drunk I got into an argument with a few strangers at the resort & almost fought some guy who was accusing me of roofing her drink to take her with me, telling me to leave her alone & to leave (because they didn’t know I was her BF) security came & while I was busy with security and gathering our belonging I see her hugged up on some dude in an intimate way. That got me really upset because this is not the first time she has been around guys, dancing, and acting a fool while drunk. I safely took her back to our room & then I got ready for dinner & ate by myself. The next day I got formally written up by the resort & she was complaining about knee pain so she stayed in bed, I had breakfast, lunch, & dinner alone at the resort. I brought her breakfast, lunch, & dinner back to the room. I had warned her that we needed to have a serious conversation when we got back home. Once we were back at home we didn’t have the talk so I had some built up resentment & then 2 days later her cousin passed away after being in hospice for a while. I found out she passed away in a text so I texted her back and didn’t get a response, I called and offered to leave work to be with her & she said she was ok with her family & cousins. She spent the whole day at her aunts house. So while she was at her aunts house I decided to go to my friends house & put something on the grill to eat dinner. She got upset & said I rather be with my friends then to be there for her. I apologized and we were okay.. but she still didn’t response to my text messages or calls so I decided to just drive to her aunt’s house uninvited with flowers, I handed the flowers to her aunt and gave her my condolences. I did not attend the wake nor the funeral because I don’t do well at funerals & haven’t been to funerals since I lost like 23 year sister who I loved very dearly. The day of the wake she spent all day there until like 10pm. The funeral was the following day at 6pm, she had spent the whole day at her aunts house until the funeral started, I went to work and called her a few times because she wouldn’t respond to my text messages, I called asking if she needed anything & to check up on how she was doing. I was trying to put aside what happened a few days ago while on vacation due to the death in the family. I feel like i would’ve done way more if I wasn’t feeling down & upset due to what happened on vacation. While she went to the funeral I went to my friend’s family reunion at my friend’s mother’s house (we’re basically family from knowing each other so long) my GF saw an instagram story of a mutual friend of ours showing us all taking a shot of tequila cheering to family. She never returned my calls or answered my text messages since the funeral…. Am I really the asshole here or was I just trying to give her space & also distract myself while I had all these negative thoughts about her drunk actions in my head constantly. FYI she’s a good girl & I trust her 100%

25,1e09h00,AITA for not correcting my friend's answers and costing them their dream job?,"Here in the UK (and probably like most other places), entering the legal profession is extremely competitive. Most elite law firms in London will receive 5,000 or so applications every year and only the most serious candidates tend to apply. All in all, your odds of getting a training contract (the route to qualifying as a solicitor) are around 2%. To make it even more complicated, many firms run ""vacation schemes"", which are effectively two week paid internships where you experience life at the firm and their departments, complete assessed tasks and likely an interview. If you do well throughout the scheme, you may land yourself a training contract.

After three years of applying, I managed to secure a vacation scheme this summer at one of the most prestigious firms in London. I was overjoyed and it felt like a culmination of all my hard work. I knew it would be competitive and for the 20 that got a spot, the firm only had 8 training contract spots.

I ended up sharing an office with another student on the scheme, who I'll call Sam. Sam was a nice guy and I got on well with him, and he explained how much securing a TC meant to him as well. One of the assessed tasks we had to complete was effectively to test attention to detail, and we were advised that this task was important. Sam asked me to check through his work to see if I agreed before he submitted, and I noticed he had made a glaring error and had chosen the wrong option by not reading the footnote correctly. I thought about correcting him, but then I thought about how competitive it is and the fact it was ultimately his work. I told him it looked good and he submitted it.

We finished the scheme about two months or so ago. I ended up getting an offer, and it was one of the best days of my life. Sadly, Sam did not, and he told me how devastated he was about having to do the process all over again. When he received his feedback call, he was told he excelled in many areas, but scored poorly in the assessed task. I feel incredibly guilty about this and feel I should have corrected him, especially as he said it was his dream firm. However, I also know that it could have been him that got the spot instead of me.

26,1e090tr,AITA for losing my temper on my Step Mom and Dad after I told them I might not be able to attend Thanksgiving?,"As my (24F) title suggests this started last Thanksgiving (2023). My Dad (52M) reached out roughly a week before the holiday & invited me & my husband (25M) to his & my step mom's (Bellatrix 55F) apartment at 12 the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I told him that Husband's family had invited us over on the same day at 5pm. 

For context, his family is about 2 hours away, & they had asked us *at least* 2 weeks prior. We also needed to take our new puppy with us, we were spending the night at his parents, so that meant we'd need to leave around 2pm.

My Dad's response was he *hoped* they planned it around everyone else's, maybe we come to theirs earlier. 

Then I realized & texted him that Husband had to work, & would get off at 12. Meaning we'd get there around 1, maybe have 30 minutes, then have to leave & go back for our dog. 

Dad basically just sends ""K"", so I think that's the end of it.

No, Bellatrix texts me it hurts her heart we aren’t coming, they’ve sacrificed for 16 years to balance holidays even though it was tough, for some reason they didn’t get to celebrate the last holidays with us either, she doesn’t understand it, she needs to know about Xmas asap-

Now this might be where I'm the ""a-hole""- but I hit my breaking point with them & let out ""16 years"" of rage.

***Multiple*** times I have gone to both of them that if they wait until the last minute we're probably going to be busy! Also, I've asked SO many times that they ASK about the date, instead they just pick one and get mad when everyone's busy. Growing up, my mom's side had their event on the day of the holiday, or **always** on a Sunday (they're very proper people). My dad's events were just ragers on Saturdays with Bellatrix's family. 

I've also tried to talk to my dad about how uncomfortable Bellatrix makes me. She's been an alcoholic since I was 7, got clean again 10 months ago. She's the type of person that ignores people's personal space, loud, judges EVERYONE that doesn't act/think the way she does. Countless times she's made fun of my appearance, weight, way I walked, ate, ETC. 

Instead of standing up for me- my dad would just ignore her, or join in & the family would laugh at me. He thinks it's funny/cute that she's so honest & just tells you whatever she's thinking. They also think that I needed to ""stop wearing your heart on your sleeve"". Despite all of this, I did just get thicker skin on the outside & tried to ignore the comments to be a part of the family. 

I texted her that they had no flexibility, yet we always try to make it work, MOST the time end up being the only people there because I don't want to let them down, yet they're always ungrateful for it, then I can't fix it this time I'm treated like a POS.

She didn't reply.

Instead it's back between me & Dad for several months, I've been low contact, we're at no resolution, they can't begin to understand why I'm ""acting this way"".

however, his one friend “amy” (20f) has always hated me and judged me for dating someone younger than me. she’s a lesbian, so i’m not worried about jealousy or her pining after him. before we dated, he asked his friends if the age gap was an issue and most said to feel it out on the first date and if it feels like there’s a power imbalance than to skip out. except amy, who was adamant that it was a bad idea and that i was a bad person for even matching with him.

amy in the beginning was very cold to me and clearly didn’t like me, but overtime warmed a little to my presence and doesn’t outright ignore me anymore. however, she still makes all these “jokes”, calling me a “cougar” and a “cradle robber” and implying that i’m so old i’m practically senile. the latter comments really get to me because there are others in the friend group who are 22 and she doesn’t make those jokes towards them. i’ve told her before that i don’t like these jokes and they make me uncomfortable, but she always says that they’re just jokes and if i really thought the age gap wasn’t a big deal then they shouldn’t bother me. 

the other day me, my bf, amy, and four of their other friends got together for dinner. it started off great, with amy and i sitting on opposite ends of the table and unable to really communicate much. when the check came, amy loudly asked my bf, completely unprompted, if his “sugar momma” was going to cover the bill for just him or the whole table. i yelled back louder than i intended that she needs to “shut the fuck up” about our ages, that i was sick of her constantly bothering us about it, and that i would love my boyfriend the same if we met at 18 or 25 or 45. ik i didn’t defend myself the best lol.

the dinner got awkward and we basically paid our portion of the bill and left immediately. the next day, i asked one of his friends that i’m closer to if i overreacted and he said i was in the right because amy just had some kind of weird personal vendetta against me because she views me as a predator. my bf agrees that the comments are annoying and rude, but that i shouldn’t have yelled at her over it at a group dinner. i feel justified, but also a little bad and am considering apologizing. this all happened two days ago and i havent heard from amy since then.

28,1e08kw4,AITA for planning to contact my bio mom?,"
I (21F) was adopted at birth by my parents. My bio mom was 15 when she had me, and her family wasn’t capable of taking care of me. The adoption process was smooth overall,  I was told I was adopted when I was 11. When I was 14 I decided to not connect with my bio mom: she lived across the country from me so it didn’t make sense. The news was given to her and her family, after that I don’t hear anything about them. All I knew about her was where she lived and how she remarried. 

Fast forward to age 17, my parents sit me down to tell me we’re getting threatening letters from her. How she’s demanding to meet me when I’m 18. How she’s referring me to the name she wanted not my real name, and how she’s clean and sober. This is all overwhelming and apparently, the letters have been going on since I was 16. I asked if she ever sent anything when I was little, they said after she moved to college there wasn’t anything else. When I was 18 we get more, I’d say at this point 4-5 letters total. My parents encouraged me to get a no contact order and I agreed. I didn’t understand and I didn’t want the stress. It was confusing as to why she moved so far and yet wanted to connect

Now I’m in college, about to graduate and living on my own. Long story short my parents are narcissists and raised me poorly. They were strict and sheltered me a lot, I forced myself out of the house and it was the best decision I ever made. 

My cousin and I both are the normal ones in the whole family. It’s not a small family. One big mentally ill one. Him and I have similar parents (duh they’re sisters) so we get along well. Him and I got into a spiff with my mom (she helped raise him) and we both are put off by her again. The most recent thing was she was tracking my car behind my back, so I was planning on leaving for good again. 

He calls me to tell me his mom has known for the past few years that I have half siblings. My bio mom had kids within the past few years. Now if my aunt knows about them, and my mom had contact with my bio mom’s family, I know my mother knew. It makes sense why my bio mom wanted to contact me. I never saw these letters myself, only my mom holding them. My mom had years to tell me about them, it would’ve changed how I approached my bio mom.

When I graduate and get my own real place (not a college apartment) I want to contact my bio mom. I don’t want to miss out on my half siblings and I want to know the truth. If my mom shielded me from this information, what else did she shield me from? However I live at home between college/jobs, so I’m not completely independent. I love my family no matter what.

I (21F) was adopted at birth by my parents. My bio mom was 15 when she had me, and her family wasn’t capable of taking care of me. The adoption process was smooth overall,  I was told I was adopted when I was 11. When I was 14 I decided to not connect with my bio mom: she lived across the country from me so it didn’t make sense. The news was given to her and her family, after that I don’t hear anything about them. All I knew about her was where she lived and how she remarried. 

Fast forward to age 17, my parents sit me down to tell me we’re getting threatening letters from her. How she’s demanding to meet me when I’m 18.

I put the PC down and when he kept going, I said, ""I heard the doorbell, grabbed my PC, and teleported downstairs.""

I carried his beer case (24 beers per Case) upstairs and asked where my drinks was (Non-alcoholic). He said he didn't bring anything because I didn't tell him. I snapped, ""I've been saying for three damn weeks I don't have anything to drink.""

I've been more temperamental lately. My dad has an alcohol problem, goes shopping twice a week for beer. This isn't the first time this kind of argument happened.

 I(28F) used to be a part of a best friend group with 3 other girls. We are all around the same age. 
Me and 1 of the girl, Jenny had been on and off friends since 3 years old. Through the years i’ve had to take several brakes from our friendship because she gets mad when she doesn’t control everything her friends do or say. 

Couple of years ago this new friendgroup formed. It was me, Jenny, Sabrina and one other girl who’s irrelavent to this story. 
Last summer Jenny started to ignore me in all social settings. We would all still hang out, she just didn’t talk to me. This time it was easier to deal with it because it wasn’t just us two, i had Sabrina who i was closest to out of the 3.  

Sabrina told me she was ignoring me because a few weeks before summer we were all partying together, I was the driver. Later that evening Jenny asked if her boyfriend and friend could get a ride home with us. I said unfortunatly I only have 5 seats in my car so I didn’t have room for 6 people. She told me the friend could be in the trunk. I told her abseloutly not, I dont want to get in trouble if anything happens. 

In the following september I invited all of my friends to my birthday dinner. The plan was me and Sabrina would go out to brunch and play darts with a few other friends that were not apart of the other group and later all my other friends would join us at a resturant for dinner.  
Because the way Jenny had been treating me since summer I told Sabrina that i’d rather not invite Jenny to my birthday. Sabrina asked me to invite her to keep the peace in the group so I sent Jenny an invitation to the dinner. She didn’t reply. Sabrina encouraged me to ask her again so I did. Her reply was “ofcourse i’ll come!”

So the day of the birthday Sabrina texts me and tells me she needs to skip brunch and darts because “Jenny doesn’t want to show up alone to dinner”. I was a little frustrated but told her it was okay. 
When dinner rolls around they show up about 30 min late, Sabrina hugs me but Jenny didn’t even look at me or wish me happy birthday. 
I’ll admit, i was a bit tipsy so this is where I might be the asshole. I looked at Jenny and said “why would someone show up to my birthday and not even say hi”. Jenny finished her meal paid by me and left. 

Few days later Jenny texted me and told she didn’t like how i spoke about her on my birthday and blocked me everywhere. Sabrina said that i knew how Jenny was so I should of just let her act like that without calling her out.

An hour before the time slot I had set aside for her, with no reply, I got a message from another friend who I hadn’t caught up with in WEEKS and we were dying to talk to each other. So, I called him until I had to go to work.

38,1e06806,AITA for telling my mom she never helps me when I need it?,"
I (23F) had a conversation with my mom earlier.  Over the last three months me and my fiancé (25M) have been taking care of my siblings while my parents tried to figure out a living situation (they’re currently living with my grandma). We’ve done everything for the children (school fees, events, doctors appointments, a car, the insurance) basically becoming second parents to them. The issue isn’t all that we’ve done for them as I love my siblings and would do these things anyway. The issue we’re having is that we were told that we’d be getting money for the children’s activities and other necessities and we haven’t seen a dime. Up to this point, I’d let it go every time something came up and we had to cover the whole expense without her paying us back (even though she had said she would) as I was doing it for my siblings sake not her paying me money for it.  This month due to some unexpected injuries (my brother broke his arm and needed screws put in and we had to pay for it with no help from her) we were a little short on the electric bill this month and asked her for help. She proceeded to tell me how she has no money right now and she can’t give us anything.  We accepted it as we thought she just didn’t have the money. Fast forward to today (when the bills are due) and she posts on Facebook and tags me in it. It’s a picture of her with a new Gucci purse with the caption “sorry I couldn’t give you the money 🫶”  We were mad, but we didn’t say anything. My sister texted my fiancé a little bit before my mom asking if I could get her juice and 10 more pods for her vape since she lost hers and he told her no, since we have all the bills to pay and no one could help out.  She then texted me and started an argument about it (I tired to include it but it said it’s too long?). I can put in the comments what she said in the texts) so am I the asshole?

40,1e054y7,AITA for singing at my husband's coworker's wedding?,"I saw a post earlier that reminded me of this and it didn't happen too long ago. I go back and forth between thinking it was no big deal and that my husband was right so I thought I'd get some thoughts.

My husband \[30M\] of 3 years and I \[29F\] attended the wedding of his coworker last week. I only knew 3 other people at the wedding, my husband's other coworkers. It was outdoors and people were just kind of huddling in their own little groups.

At a certain point, they started playing a song that is a typical white-people-karaoke-song but it's one of my favorites so I went booking it to the dance floor. When I got there the DJ was asking people over and over again to sing the song... he was putting his microphone out towards the guests and no one wanted to do it. So I said screw it, let's go.

There was no open bar so I'd had two beers at that point, I was not drunk or even tipsy. I got the mic and sang the song and it actually got some people's attentions, more came towards the dance floor and were joining in to sing. (No, this is not a r/thatHappened  moment... just your typical song like Piano Man or Sweet Caroline where everyone knows the words.)

I finished, some people clapped, I gave the mic back. On my way back the groomsmen and groom grabbed me to say I did a great job, they had me do a shot of whiskey with them, then I went to my original group. I was beaming and so excited but my husband... he just had this stink face.

One of his coworkers asked him ""Did you see what \[OP\] just did?! That was amazing!"" and my husband said ""Yeah... this isn't the first time she's pulled something like that.""

I immediately deflated. He made it sound like I had embarrassed him. I stayed quiet for the rest of the evening and he never said anything to me afterwards about it; I figured if I had upset him we could talk about me singing, but he never brought it up and I was too embarrassed because he made it seem like I just acted like a total idiot. So AITA?

When the obituary was published my husband and I thought the photo they chose wasn’t the best. Actually, it was pretty bad. Not only did it not showcase her beauty and bright personality, it made her look…off, like she was drugged. And there was some kind of filter on it that made her look fake and way more made up than she ever was. It almost looked like she’d been embalmed and they propped her eyes open to take the photo.

It was untimely, she was young, and I wanted to honor her through my grief. Her other siblings and her children thanked me for honoring her, people offered their condolences, etc.

43,1e0505p,AITA for ditching my friends?,"
I (25f) and two of my good friends, “Molly” (26f) and “Luke” (23m) have known each other for about two years. We all met online through a game we all played. I introduced them so we could all play video games together. 

The three of us became essentially inseparable, we spoke every day, every minute, every week. I truly considered them my best friends. 

After a couple months, I realized I had started to develop feelings for Luke. Over time I became less resistant to these feelings and leaned into my crush because I enjoyed the attention and feeling wanted. I told Molly all of this. 

Molly encouraged me to feel this way and assured me that Luke would like me for me and that his feelings were genuine. However, Luke would often flirt with Molly just as much as me. 

Come spring 2024, Molly and her boyfriend broke up. But a few days after the breakup a friend of a friend let me know that Molly and her boyfriend broke up because Molly cheated. Molly cheated with Luke. They had been exchanging nudes and sexting for the past month before the breakup and Molly finally confessed to her boyfriend, but not to me. 

Upon confrontation they both confessed and apologized. I was heartbroken and blindsided. They both agreed it was best to take space from each other and swore to earn back my trust. After a few weeks and things had settled down, all three of us were back to being friends. Not soon after, they both asked for my blessing so they could be together because they both had feelings still. I gave in because I wanted to forgive and move on and keep my friends. I was scared of losing them and expressed that, and they assured me they wouldn’t abandon me. 

Since then, things have been strange. I have started dating someone new and began branching out as well as starting a new job. But I also have withdrawn from them because I feel like a third wheel. They have consistently asked me to hang out with them and make plans but each time I say no because I am busy (sometimes) or give a vague maybe. I have not played video games with them in weeks and when I do it just isn’t fun anymore. 

Today I have been getting texts and messages from both of them saying that I am a hypocrite and did exactly what i was so afraid of when they got together. They say I hurt their feelings because I don’t make time for them and flake when we do have plans. They have both claimed that they worked so hard to repair our friendship after lying to me and now I am demanding more. 

So now I feel conflicted. I have withdrawn intentionally out of hurt, out of feeling awkward, and so I can prioritize my irl friends and partner. But there was a large unintentional rift due to my life being busier because of my new job and new partner. Molly and Luke both know about my life changes, but are convinced this was my fault alone and accused me of abandoning our friendship. I can’t help but feel like they have a point, and feel very guilty.

45,1e04lwk,AITA for cancelling on my dad last minute and then hanging up on him when he got upset?,"We had a family reunion scheduled for noon the day after the 4th of July holiday. My house is halfway between my dad's and the reunion so he planned to meet up at my place and ride with us. My son hardly napped on the 4th and was up late due to the fireworks so was extremely cranky on the morning of the reunion. I called my dad about 15 minutes before he would be leaving his place to let him know that I needed to leave early so my son could get a good long nap in the car on the way to the reunion and that I would just meet him there. He didn't answer but I left a voicemail and a text. I know for a fact he checks his phone constantly. He has it set to notify him every sixty seconds if he misses a phonecall until he clears the notification. 

About 45 minutes later I get a phonecall from my husband saying my dad was at my house freaking out that I didn't wait for him. He said he didn't bring his wallet and didn't have enough gas to make it to the reunion. So my husband gave him a $100 bill. My dad leaves my house and then calls me freaking out yelling and screaming at me because he supposedly can't come to the reunion now because he didn't have gas and left his wallet at home. At this point I called him out and asked ""didn't *husband* just give you a hundred bucks?"" He started screaming at me saying no gas station was going to take $100 and that now he was going to be so late anyway there was no point in going. (He was leaving my house about ten minutes later than what we had originally planned.)

I told him he still had plenty of time to get there and I know for a fact all the gas stations by my house will take $100 if you are getting gas. But then he started freaking out saying ""they're all full."" To clarify what he meant, I asked ""are you saying all the gas pumps are taken?"" In a super sarcastic condescending tone he went ""well yeah, that's usually what that f****** means isn't it?""

I said ""I know you're upset but don't be a dick."" He started screaming at me saying he IS a dick and it's my fault for abandoning him. I replied with ""i am sorry that me prioritizing my baby screwed up your day but you have no right to talk to me like that. Hope to see you there. Bye."" And hung up. 

He pretty much entirely ignored me at the reunion, hasn't talked to me since and I've heard from family members that he is extremely upset with me for ""blowing him off and treating him like garbage.""

For context, even when my dad is in a good mood he is an extremely loud, intense person. I knew my son would absolutely not nap in the car with him, and the drive would be shorter since I would be just heading straight there. He would have been a total nightmare and we would have had to leave early which my dad also would have been upset about.

I told him he still had plenty of time to get there and I know for a fact all the gas stations by my house will take $100 if you are getting gas. But then he started freaking out saying ""they're all full."" To clarify what he meant, I asked ""are you saying all the gas pumps are taken?"" In a super sarcastic condescending tone he went ""well yeah, that's usually what that f****** means isn't it?""

I said ""I know you're upset but don't be a dick."" He started screaming at me saying he IS a dick and it's my fault for abandoning him. I replied with ""i am sorry that me prioritizing my baby screwed up your day but you have no right to talk to me like that. Hope to see you there. Bye."" And hung up. 

He pretty much entirely ignored me at the reunion, hasn't talked to me since and I've heard from family members that he is extremely upset with me for ""blowing him off and treating him like garbage.""

For context, even when my dad is in a good mood he is an extremely loud, intense person. I knew my son would absolutely not nap in the car with him, and the drive would be shorter since I would be just heading straight there. He would have been a total nightmare and we would have had to leave early which my dad also would have been upset about.

46,1e04kev,AITA for cancelling on last minute plans because i got sick?,"  My best friend invited me on a camping trip with her family for the upcoming weekend. She told me (on sunday) that we would be leaving on thursday and coming back on sunday (4 days). I have horrible anxiety and hate last minute plans, but we wanted to go out and do stuff this summer so I told her id come. I also informed right away that my mom was sick, and there was a possibility I would get sick before we left and I’ll keep her updated. 

  The next day she texts me and lets me know we’re actually leaving tomorrow because she was able to get the day off. I told her I wouldnt be able to do tomorrow because I worked, and she told me she called in, so I should too (she also mentioned something that gave me the idea that she definitely knew about this camping trip a couple days prior to asking me). I thought about it and decided it wouldn’t be the end of the world because a week camping trip was worth missing the 4 hour shift. I also went out to buy sunscreen and bug spray. That night I start feeling sick and let her know right away, but mentioned i might be able to tough it out. She tells me I should come anyways because she doesnt want to go camping with her family. I said I was sorry and Ill do what I can to feel better for tomorrow. She then (sorta) went off, saying how me and our other friend cancelled on her (even though she asked the other friend later than me, the day BEFORE), and that shes not even able to go with her boyfriend, that its the worst summer ever and that she took time off and now we have no plans. She never told me she took time off? If she did, we definitely would’ve ve had a sleepover/night out. I said I was sorry and Ill do my best, and she got very dry after that. 

The next morning I texted her and let her know I was feeling worse, and I wouldnt be able to make it. I also apologized and told her as soon as shes back we can go out/see eachother and plan another camping trip for the future. She left me on read, and hasnt said anything since. I sent her that message yesterday, and im considering texting her, but I also think the way she acted was immature and unfair, considering it was a week away from home and i was told last minute. I also told her i might get sick right off the bat and she ignored me.

 I understand how awful it would feel if i were in her shoes, being cancelled on especially when you’re excited for the plan sucks. I usually find it really easy to understand others perspectives, but this time its hard for me to make the judgement. Im a people pleaser so its easy for me to take all the blame.

 I can see how we BOTH are the assholes too, but i just cant get over the fact that she asked me to go already short notice, and then changed the plans to make it even more short notice, and now shes mad that I cant make it.

47,1e04jcr,AITA the asshole for asking my friend to reimburse me for the whole holiday and not just her portion? ,"I 22F and my friend Ana 23F booked a one week holiday for the end of this month together. We had spoken about booking a holiday for ages, and found a really good deal last year and booked our stay.

We have spoken about this trip for ages, I made an itinerary for the week including concert tickets, in my name, and a spa treatment package for the two of us. 

Ana and I are high earners in our friend group, and this holiday is a huge splurge for the two of us. Ana got laid off at work at the start of the year and couldn’t find a job for months.

She told me yesterday that her start date is a day before when our holiday was supposed to be and she didn’t mention the holiday at the interview as she really needed the job and now thinks it’s too late to ask so will just join the job at the start date.

I am happy for her but obviously upset about the holiday we had to plan together. I asked Ana to just cancel the holiday, but she said she picked the non refundable package as it worked out to be much cheaper, and the last date to exchange flights and accommodation was at the start of the month. 

I got upset and told her that both of these errors were her fault and she told me that I could still go on the holiday with someone else, however I know no one else in our friend group can afford this and I would feel awful asking any of them to come without covering for the majority of their holiday. I have already taken this leave for work and ask my busiest work period is September onwards, I will not be allowed to take leave them.

Ana later admitted that she also can’t afford this holiday anymore, as she had taken a pay cut and a more junior role to her old position. She said she can reimburse me in instalments, but it will take her a while. The reason she waited so long to say something was so she could try and arrange a way to come but she was embarrassed to admit she couldn’t afford it anymore.

I asked her to cover the full holiday as it is on her that it can’t be cancelled or exchanged as she waited that late to tell me she can’t make it, and she signed her job contract way before.

48,1e04hxy,AITA For expecting my husband to be able to take care of the kids for one night a week,"My husband (39M) and I (37F) have been married for 11 years and have 3 kids (8, 6, & 3).  We both work full-time and our 2 oldest kids are starting to become more active in sports/activities so our day-to-day lives are pretty busy and hectic.  To maintain a sense of self, I have a happy hour every Tuesday with a group of friends.  Sometimes it's just an appetizer and a drink and I'm home in an hour or so. But other times we will get full meals and end up gossiping for 3-4 hours.  

Last night was one of the long gossiping nights because one of my friends had gone through a break-up.  My husband sent me a text around 7:30pm asking when I was going to be home because he was having trouble getting our 3-year-old to bed and needed help.  I cut the evening short and got home shortly after 8pm.  

When I got home, my husband was reading to our 2 oldest kids and getting them settled into bed.  I asked him where our 3-year-old was and he said she was in our room.  I found her laying in our bed and it was obvious she had been crying.  She gave me a big hug right away and I consoled her and brought her to her room where she fell asleep pretty much immediately.  

I asked my husband what the big deal was and he told me that our 3-year-old was refusing to go to bed without me and was screaming at him and throwing tantrums so he left her in our room while he read to the other kids.  I told him that doesn't seem like a good enough reason for him to make me cut my only social time short.  He told me that he just asked when I was coming home, he never told me that I needed to come home right away.  He said it took me over 30 minutes to get home anyway, so I must have kept talking for a while.  

I told him that he should be able to take care of the kids for one night a week so that I can have social time.  He got mad and told me that he can take care of the kids just fine but that some nights he just wants to have an idea of when I'm coming home so that he can tell the kids, especially the 3-year-old since she is going through a cling-to-mom stage.  He said the open-ended ""happy hour"" that turns into a 3-hour meal isn't working for him anymore and he needs me to give him a more structured plan.

I told him about my friend's breakup and why we were talking so long and he told me that he doesn't care about whatever gossip we were talking about.  He said he just wants me to be cognizant and aware of the fact that not giving him an expected time to be home makes it more difficult for him to plan the night out for the kids.  

He said he's glad I'm getting social time but that I need to be more respectful of how that impacts him and the kids at home.  He also said that my comment about him needing to be able to take care of the kids was a low blow and that he would never say anything like that to me.  I told him that one night a week is not too much to ask and that he still could've handled things by himself if he just took a breath and stayed calm.",Asshole,2024-07-10,"AITA For expecting my husband to be able to take care of the kids for one night a week My husband (39M) and I (37F) have been married for 11 years and have 3 kids (8, 6, & 3).

We finally got together and my friend went on to university but every time she got back she would go to my boyfriend to tell him about her s*x life and how many frat parties she was going to and that made my boyfriend feel uncomfortable with me hanging out with her especially when she would ask me to come visit. I did defend her multiple times by saying he is misunderstanding her and that’s not all she does but it was hard to change his mind when she kept on talking about it (like that was the only thing she would talk about) so finally my boyfriend said he felt uncomfortable with me hanging out with her out of fear I would start doing things she did and it began a constant fight between us.

For some reasons, while just walking around an old toy shop, some old “Monster High dolls” seemed to have caught my eyes. They’re the one from like 2016 which don’t even sell anymore and they were surprisingly cheap (They’re around $42 in my currency and the same from back then and apparently sell for more than that now). I remember how was always wanted one as a child and my parents couldn’t really afford it because they were too expensive. I couldn’t really resist the urge to buy it. It just made me feel so excited inside. 

Once I got home, I just wanted to tell my mother about it and that’s where I messed up. She got extremely mad at me for spending so much money I wouldn’t even play with and saying how selfish I was for using such a ridiculous amount instead to which I could’ve used to pay for my after tuitions which they’re paying for.

I still tried to apologise for my mistakes numerous times and my parents did forgive me at some point. However today, I asked my mother where did she hid the doll and she simply responded by saying she’d returned the doll since the receipt was with it.

Basically, every time my wife and I have big fights (not huge but not small either), I feel I don’t want to see her as my wallpaper for a while as it makes me feel uncomfortable because those pictures would normally make me feel happy. Whenever that happens I would set my wallpaper to that of my son (or my cat before my son was born) and change it back to my wife some days later when I felt she did something that made me happy. 

I didn’t think this was such a big deal or anything but I just heard from my wife that she hates that I do that all the time. According to her, changing the wall paper when I have negative feelings about her is a really bad thing (she has never gotten upset if I changed it without having negative feelings though). 

She also mentioned that she has never changed hers for a negative reason. And that it’s some kind of betrayal. That it’s childish, irresponsible, and comparable to a teenage girl that wants to get attention from her bf and selfishly hurting him because of that. She also said that it’s not something a mature adult would do nor a healthy married couple. 

Just to be clear, I’ll stop that behavior as I understand that regardless of what everyone else thinks, prioritizing whatever she feels is more important. 

I just really wanna know if what I’ve been doing so far is really such a big thing that would make me TA.

Edit: I just want to clarify a couple of things. 

1) Me changing my wallpaper isn’t with the intention of her knowing I did it. Sometimes she notices, sometimes she doesn’t. When I change it back it isn’t also in a way to “reward” her behavior towards me. I just change it back because I remember how sweet she can be and I feel I want to see her all the time. (I literally raise my phone just to see her on the Lock Screen sometimes)

2) I don’t think she is being controlling or anything. In fact I believe this wallpaper thing might have been blown up by some experiences we’ve had in the past. We aren’t a couple that wears our wedding rings all the time, specially since taking care of a newborn would require us to not wear it as we might have hurt him. During that time I used to also not wear or take my wedding ring off and if I was very upset at her. (Always at home and without plans of going out). I didn’t feel this was such a big deal then but I understand I was totally in the wrong about that.

My Stepbrother (22M) was 20 at the time. Growing up as a single child I was dying to create a bond with him, so spent a lot of time with him and trusted everything he said. Couple weeks after I’ve found out he does much more than just smoking pot, and does hard drugs. He survived overdosing during this time, asked me to lend him money multiple times, and stole money by breaking into my room. He borrowed money from my friends lying that I vouched for him, and destroyed some of my friendships. my Stepfather kicked him out of the house multiple times, but each time he found a way to act like he’s clean now and get back in. This cycle happened 5+ times. At first I believed him too, even defended him against my stepfather and mother asking them to give him one more chance. But after several times and backstabs, I lost faith. Last summer he stole my mother’s wedding ring and said that “my mom was framing him to get him kicked out.” We moved out after my stepfather believed him, but shortly after my stepfather realized he was lying and kicked him out. He promised us he would never make us live with him ever again and we moved back in under this condition. He stole my guitar and other personal items while moving out. 2 months after this event, to no surprise, he managed to trick my stepfather again.

This summer, I decided to forgive my stepfather after my Mom’s efforts and moved back in for the summer break. A month after moving in, my stepbrother started manipulating my stepfather again and now is on the verge of moving back in.

54,1e047zj,WIBTA if I clean my brother's disgusting room while he's away?,"I'm in a bit of an interesting situation here. My brother (32m) and I (21f) both live at home with our mother. For me, its helpful because we live really close to both my job and school, and it allows me to build up my savings because my mother does not charge us any rent (and pays for our education and food, we both received a used car from her when we got our licenses.) Basically, we are both in a very fortunate position and my mother works very hard to make sure we're comfortable. I recognize my privilege here, so I go overtime with helping out around the house (fully caring for our dogs, yard work, cooking, I split all daily chores with my mom about 50/50) and I'm happy to do it! My brother, however, is not. He leaves his mess everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE. He's left his dirty underwear on the kitchen counter, constantly leaves beer bottles in the bathtub (??) and does NO chores. He's also quite incompetent with important stuff, like getting his school papers in order or keeping money in the bank. The worst part is that he's such a *dick* when we call him out on it. He gets extremely defensive, argues, then basically tells us that were being hysterical over nothing. My mother can be pretty intense when she's upset, so the arguments are non-stop in the house.

Here's my dilemma: I'm pretty sure it's not just incompetence, but depression, mostly because I've seen this before with myself. I completely shut myself off from friends and was snappy with everyone I loved, and my room was a freakin mud pit. I'm talking cockroaches, broken furniture, no sheets on my bed, the works. This is what his room looks like now, and frankly the smell alone is unbearable. I won't go into detail, but let's just say it's not a healthy environment. The only way that I got out of my hellhole of a depressive spiral was my partner, who saw my bedroom and cleaned it for me no questions asked. Ever since then, this inspired me to keep it clean, do my daily upkeep, which gave me a sense of purpose and reason to get up in the morning. That drove me to actually leave my house, go back to school, and start my life again. Cleaning now gives me an insane amount of confidence, and I'm so glad he did that for me. Without him just buckling down and saving me from that mess, I would still be rotting in my bed.

I feel like I need to be that person for my brother, I've offered to help him clean before but he's declined and brushed me off (I think he may be embarrassed.) He's leaving for a few weeks, and I suggested to my mom that I clean his room for him while he's away. She said no, that he's a grown man and he needs to do it himself and that its not my responsibility. idk, I just remember looking at my own depression pit and just not... seeing the point of cleaning. I love my brother, and I truly think that him having a clean and healthy room will make a difference for him, but I don't want to embarrass him and I definitely don't want to enable him as my mom says. What do I do?

55,1e047f5,AITA for telling my husband to put down his phone during our son’s baseball game,"My husband and I are both in our 40's.  At a recent baseball tournament, after a game, I asked my husband (in private)if he could not look at his phone during the entire game.  If he needs to work or buy parts to fix things around the house or our car(he usually buy stuff on amazon on his phone), he can stay home and do that.  I said that he doesn't look like he enjoyed watching the game and I'd rather not be seen with him if he's going to be on his phone the whole time.  He doesn't say much right then, but right when we get ready to go to another game, he told me I should have kept my mouth shut and that I've ruined his trip.  

We didn't talk the entire car ride to the park, because we have another kid in the car.  When we got to the park, he wasn't on the phone but you can tell he's not happy.  

After a couple days, he's seems to be getting better and not giving me the silent treatment.  He asked me why I was down, I told him, I'm still trying to figure out why he got so mad at me.  He said that he was mad because I care more about how other people would think of us than our marriage.  

So AITA?  Does he have a point?  

Edit: the amount of time he spent on the phone is excessive...I'm talking about 95% of the time during a two hour game.  I'm not saying he can't ever be on the phone for a quick text or during down time.  But he does this ALL the time.  He's reading articles, shopping, long texts with friends, and watching the news.  He admits that he has ADHD (although undiagnosed), but that doesn't give him the excuse to be rude and seem uninterested in our son's game.

She has a baby but she uses that as an excuse to not do anything around the house, she barely takes care of her son (6m).

Well  I started to shame her about how she’s not taking good care of her son and how my mom is better cause she had to take care of 4 kids and that she can barely take care of 2 and also about how she should already be looking for a house. she then told me that she’s too busy taking care of her baby and how I don’t know anything since I’m younger.

My aunt told my mom about this and my mom said that I was being an asshole and that I should apologize to her since she’s taking care of the baby and I don’t know anything. However my dad agrees with me.

And as the older brother, I made sure I spent as much time with them as possible. One of the ways we'd spend time together is simply cuddling on the couch and watching movies, and sometimes we'd all fall asleep holding each other. We still do that to this day, and it's always been our way of bonding even as we've gotten older. We're affectionate, it's how our family is.

  
Now for clarity, this post involves me, my GF of nearly a year (25F), and Lily (The older sister)

  
At the end of June, Lily asked if she could spend a week or two at my house. We haven't seen each other much since I moved two hours away back in February, so I said yes and let GF know Lily's coming over. She was excited and happy to have her around. She knows about my close bond with my siblings, and she finds it rather cute. Ever since Lily's arrival, we've been having a great time, going to the beach, going shopping, watching movies, etc. GF and Lily also spent some girl time together when she wasn't working. Everything seemed good.

  
Two nights ago, GF was working late, so it was just me and Lily. After dinner, I suggested we watch a movie, and she agreed. We were laughing, joking around, and carrying on like the old times. Halfway into the movie, Lily fell asleep with her head on my chest. I didn't want to move her, or risk waking her up, so I just stayed there on the couch with my hand around her back, and eventually I fell asleep.

  
That next morning, I woke up to GF screaming at me. She went ballistic, calling me a cheater, said I was disgusting, and even started yelling at Lily. I tried to explain to her that we were cuddling and nothing more. I told GF I loved her, and I would never in my life cheat on her, especially NOT with my own sister! But she didn't listen to me!

59,1e03s7f,AITA for not doing housework and making my roommate leave for 2 weeks,"I (18f) live with two of my friends Jenna (20f) and Ally (17f)(these are not their real names) when we moved in 5 months ago we all decided that the housework would be distributed equally. For a while this arrangement worked well and we all did each others laundry, cleaning and dishes when it fit into our schedule. A while ago I noticed that me and jenna had done all the laundry for a couple weeks and that Ally hadn’t done any of it. We didn’t say anything about it for a while because we wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After a week she still hadn’t done any laundry, she also didn’t clean much and groaned when I asked her to dry the dishes for me. She usually gets annoyed when I ask her to do anything. One day she came into my room and complained that she didn’t have any clean cloathes so I calmly said “you should do a load then”. She just sort of rolled her eyes and walked away. This happened a couple more times but se didn’t do a single load. I then decided to just stop doing laundry. I sort of wanted to see how long it would take for her to do laundry herself. At the same time I was just sick of doing most of it myself. A month after that she came to me really angry and told me off about how I needed to do the laundry and I just told her that I hadn’t  done it in a while because I was the only one who did it for a long time and I felt it was unfair that I did most of it, with the exception of Jenna doing a few loads.

When she came home two weeks later she started to do laundry wich I was really happy with and I thought it was all in order but then she started bossing me around telling me that I did everything wrong even though she didn’t even know how I did the laundry (it was in the exact same way as she did it) she went on for about 45 minutes putting everything in piles messing up the whole bathroom. She then proceeded to do laundry for three days and then she just stopped.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA for not doing housework and making my roommate leave for 2 weeks I (18f) live with two of my friends Jenna (20f) and Ally (17f)(these are not their real names) when we moved in 5 months ago we all decided that the housework would be distributed equally. For a while this arrangement worked well and we all did each others laundry, cleaning and dishes when it fit into our schedule. A while ago I noticed that me and jenna had done all the laundry for a couple weeks and that Ally hadn’t done any of it. We didn’t say anything about it for a while because we wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After a week she still hadn’t done any laundry, she also didn’t clean much and groaned when I asked her to dry the dishes for me. She usually gets annoyed when I ask her to do anything. One day she came into my room and complained that she didn’t have any clean cloathes so I calmly said “you should do a load then”. She just sort of rolled her eyes and walked away. This happened a couple more times but se didn’t do a single load. I then decided to just stop doing laundry. I sort of wanted to see how long it would take for her to do laundry herself. At the same time I was just sick of doing most of it myself. A month after that she came to me really angry and told me off about how I needed to do the laundry and I just told her that I hadn’t  done it in a while because I was the only one who did it for a long time and I felt it was unfair that I did most of it, with the exception of Jenna doing a few loads.

60,1e03cpi,AITA for refusing to take “check in” photos for my bodybuilding bf?,"Long story short; SO (m33) and I (f31) have been together going on 4 years and have a toddler. After two years of struggling to get back into work after the baby (housecleaning in the meantime) I am finally getting a stable income. Bodybuilding professionally has always been SO’s dream so we decided this is the year for him to do it, and I would fully support him.

Bodybuilding is expensive to do so our deal was that I will cover the bills and rent and he will cover his coaching/household groceries since he will eat a LOT/supplements so he can focus 100% on bodybuilding and take a step back from working full time.

Another notable thing is it is both of our goals to live from social media income. We discuss this constantly and it is a dream of ours. For context; I have over 145k followers over 4 platforms that I have grown in the past year and a half. I get a fair amount of income, nothing crazy but enough to cover bills. I’m filming myself all day and when I’m not filming I am editing and posting and it’s incredibly time consuming. Because of this we have 3 tripods and 2 photography lights. They are super easy to set up and fold away, simple inexpensive ones from Amazon. SO has 8k followers but only works on 1 platform.

SO’s on week 3 of coaching and has to send a “check in” photo to his coach along with his weight in the AM every Wednesday. Last week and the week before I helped him but I told him he should use  a tripod so it’s a more consistent angle for a photo, also because I have a lot to do myself and can’t just drop everything to help him every single time. He also has been lazy to go to the gym in the morning to get his actual weight and has been sending the weight from days prior for check ins. 

This morning (Wednesday) he again asked me to help him take photos but that he needs to use the photo lights we have. I told him sure, go set up the light while I get my coffee ready and milk ready for our toddler when she wakes up in a minute.

I finish getting the milk ready and he was standing there with his phone and the folded light on the ground with the cord still wrapped neatly around it. He didn’t even try to set it up and was waiting for me to come do it for him. I lost my temper and told him forget it, he can do it all himself and use one of our 3 tripods. I went to get our toddler and left him to fend for himself. 

He told me he didn’t know how to extend the light and didn’t want to try in case he breaks it or something. He also said he didn’t know how to extend any of our 3 tripods.. that we have had for over a year. I told him if he wants to be a bodybuilder influencer he better figure out how to use a simple tripod and photo light and good luck honestly if he can’t do that on his own. He is angry that I didn’t just take a couple seconds to take the photos for him since it’s only once per week and only takes a moment. He also said that I promised to support him, which is true.

61,1e039sh,AITA for ignoring my friend? ,"So this story went down about a month ago and I've been genuinely wondering whether I was in the wrong about it as I don't believe I was. As an introduction, my friend (M20) and me (19F) are both in the same university.

Me and my friend (we'll call A) often hang out, sometimes for nights on end as we both love to game together. As I was back in university after going away for medical reasons for about 6 months, we spent almost every second together hanging out. Such was the case after a long all-nighter we pulled gaming together, when I invited him to come over to my house to watch movies as soon as he woke up the next day. 

It was the morning after, I was expecting him, and I opened the door as soon as I heard it. However, another friend of mine (who we'll call B) happened to be passing by the front of my house at that exact moment. It was hot as hell outside and I wanted to catch up with B as we hadn't talked at all since I returned from my long absence, so I ushered A inside my house and told him jokingly he knows where the water and AC is since he's been there a million times before and last time he was there, he poured himself a cup of water without asking me (which obviously I don't mind, I was making a joke about it.) 

So I pulled the door half closed and begun catching up with friend B which went on for longer than I expected and since we like to joke together a lot, I was laughing quite loudly. Eventually I wished him well and he went on his merry way but when I entered back into my house, friend A was quiet with his arms crossed. I was really confused so I asked him what was wrong and he wouldn't answer. I probed him a little more until he said ""Wouldn't you rather go talk to friend B?"" 

I was very confused on why he'd be mad at this point and so confronted him, at which point he said ""You pushed me inside the house without so much as a hello or a hug and abandoned me here while you laughed your heart out with friend B."" (keep in mind I did say hello to him, just not as dramatic as it usually is) 

I recognised that may have been rude on my part, so I asked him why he didn't come outside to join the conversation since he felt left out and he replied he came here to talk to me, not him.

Now, I'm a huge people pleaser so I felt absolutely disgusting with myself for making this mistake and I spent the next hour apologising for being rude without realising it until he eventually moved on from it. Now, though, looking back at the situation, it seems a bit unfair as we were already spending so much time together all day and all night that taking 5 minutes to catch up with some other friend of mine I hadn't seen in 6 months shouldn't have been such a big deal, especially since the rest of the day we'd be together and it wasn't like I invited friend B to join us without getting friend A's consent. 

Was I genuinely in the wrong here? Was what I did rude? Was it worth friend A feeling as disrespected as he did?

67,1e02uwd,AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids despite her having no other options? ,"So for some context, my sister (25y) and I (23y) both live together under our dad's roof. My sister has three kids. A 7mo baby, a 4 yo and a 6 yo. The two kids have a different dad than the baby that they both live with during the school year. My sister keeps them during the summer. This is a relatively new agreement, made around the time they finally filed for divorce around a half a year to a year ago. Basically long enough she should've come up with a plan but not long enough for her to have experienced taking care of her two kids with her now having a job and a baby. She does have the baby in daycare, but as for her other two kids she cannot afford to put them in daycare or summer camp or what have you. Her schedule also conflicts with the daycare schedule meaning that she works Saturdays and the daycare is closed Saturday. Most of the time this means she's calling our dad to come get the baby and take care of her for a while. 
I am a SAHM (Stay at home mom for the uninitiated). I basically run our household, I have an 18 mo toddler I care for at home and my partner (who also lives with us) works a varied schedule. My dad works a varied schedule as well but both him and my partner do manual labor. 

Now. To the meat and potatoes. I'm getting stuck with babysitting duty for her two kids. We honestly tried to work things out but I told her I didn't want to care for them while she worked the entire summer because they're chaotic gremlins and I am a high strung individual as it is. The first week was a lot easier because of the varying schedule of my partner and father (plus we had family visiting) so they were always being watched/entertained by someone. They need *constant* adult supervision or else they turn into tasmanian devils. I told my sister that she needed to find other arrangements since we're all hitting burnout, but even I'm at a loss for what she can do. I'm stuck between ""that's not my problem"" and ""I wouldn't know what to do either"". But I don't want to continue to risk my sanity, so I bowed out today.

Either way, I feel bad, and I must know. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids despite her having no other options?  So for some context, my sister (25y) and I (23y) both live together under our dad's roof. My sister has three kids. A 7mo baby, a 4 yo and a 6 yo. The two kids have a different dad than the baby that they both live with during the school year. My sister keeps them during the summer. This is a relatively new agreement, made around the time they finally filed for divorce around a half a year to a year ago. Basically long enough she should've come up with a plan but not long enough for her to have experienced taking care of her two kids with her now having a job and a baby. She does have the baby in daycare, but as for her other two kids she cannot afford to put them in daycare or summer camp or what have you. Her schedule also conflicts with the daycare schedule meaning that she works Saturdays and the daycare is closed Saturday. Most of the time this means she's calling our dad to come get the baby and take care of her for a while. 
I am a SAHM (Stay at home mom for the uninitiated). I basically run our household, I have an 18 mo toddler I care for at home and my partner (who also lives with us) works a varied schedule. My dad works a varied schedule as well but both him and my partner do manual labor. 

Now. To the meat and potatoes. I'm getting stuck with babysitting duty for her two kids. We honestly tried to work things out but I told her I didn't want to care for them while she worked the entire summer because they're chaotic gremlins and I am a high strung individual as it is. The first week was a lot easier because of the varying schedule of my partner and father (plus we had family visiting) so they were always being watched/entertained by someone. They need *constant* adult supervision or else they turn into tasmanian devils. I told my sister that she needed to find other arrangements since we're all hitting burnout, but even I'm at a loss for what she can do. I'm stuck between ""that's not my problem"" and ""I wouldn't know what to do either"". But I don't want to continue to risk my sanity, so I bowed out today.

The situation happened this Sunday, but we were still arguing later into this week. As soon as my mom gets upset about something, she will get on the phone and call every single family member she can get in contact with to talk about me right in front of my face. I decided that two could play at that game, so I called one of my friends to talk about the way my mom was treating me since she wanted to be on the phone.

Last year, my friend was really depressed, and we were on the app Wizz. She decided to hook up with a random guy that she had only met once and lost her virginity to him in a pizza shop bathroom. I thought it was really out of character for her, and I was worried about her. I just thought it was a huge safety concern and asked my mom for advice on how to handle the situation because when I wanted to talk to my friend about it, she would get very angry and think that I was judging her or calling her a whore. My mom said that she was in a similar situation when she was in high school and that she lost a lot of friends because of it. We just talked about it in confidence. (Btw I did NOT call her out her name she made that up but I did tell her everything else)

Well, when I got on the phone with this friend to talk about it, my mom decided to tell her that I don’t like being her friend and that I think she’s a whore, sharing all the things I told her in confidence, just to try to ruin our friendship and hurt her feelings. My friend is really upset with me that I told my mom, but I feel like I should be able to tell my mother things that are going on and be vulnerable with her without her throwing it in my face. I didn’t expect that, and it was really immature of her.

One girl I saw I had to cancel last minute twice in a row due to work emergencies, she let it slide the first time even though she has a cancelation fee (I think because she didn't want to lose my business), but 2nd time I had a last minute work emergency again. 

She wanted me to pay her for the session I refused because I had a good reason and can't help that I had a work emergency,  I feel bad that she lost out on other clients but this could not be helped or avoided on my end. 

She did a reverse search on my phone number and found contact info for my siblings and son and daughter (both in their 20s) and said she'd send my texts and emails to where they work (to cause maximum drama and humiliation) if I didn't pay her for missed session, she was really angry because she turned away another client that had wanted a longer booking (but booked after me so she turned him away) I feel bad but this couldn't be helped 

I told her I wouldn't stand for bl@ck Mail and blocked her number. She followed through on what she said, it was extra humiliating for my daughter because she's a teacher and her boss (the principal) was very upset about these getting faxed over to the school.

71,1e02cks,AITA for angrily voice my frustration with my mom's lifestyle.,"Throughout my (F33) childhood my mom (F55) was always struggling financially, She did her best to provide me with education and made sure I would become an independent, self-sufficient woman. My father was a deadbeat that never paid child support or any sort of assistance. My mom always had to work hard and we struggled a lot, until my stepfather came into the picture. When my mom met my stepfather things got much, much better, we were still poor but our quality of life increased, I had my first job and was contributing to the household, my mom had a small business that she managed from our house, my stepfather had a good job, so we were a three income household without large debts and living comfortable.

As our lives started to improve, my mom took a turn. She went from a hardworking, life of the party, outgoing, beautiful, happy woman to this greedy, judgmental, catholic and easily irritated persona.

I got married at age 25, moved to the USA and since then tried very hard to build something for myself, I don't make a lot of money, average income with no children. The problem is that she also stopped working completely, relying on government assistance, her business didn't survive her lack of discipline, her marriage ended the same year I moved out, her family avoids spending too much time around her, so she is never invited to anything. Since then she has seen me as her personal ATM. She asked me to renovate the house as she wanted to rent the 1st floor for an extra income, I did, she never listed the house for rent. She asked to build a house in the countryside as the city has become more dangerous, and she promised me that she would put the house in the city on the market and live fulltime on the countryside house, now halfway on construction, she said she will keep both houses as the countryside is too quiet for her.

Last week I was visiting with my new partner, as soon as we arrived she started asking me for things: she needs a new TV, an expensive dental treatment is necessary, I had to pay for the meals, beers and everything we consumed while visiting... When she got jealous of the time I was dedicating to my aunties and uncles she said that all these people were horrible to her and she didn't understand why I was being so nice to them, when she should be the focus of my attention I blew up, I told her how I don't have anything in common with her, how lazy and judgmental has she became, that her lack of accountability has always ruined her relationships and how we don't have anything to talk about because every time she seems me or talk to me is always to ask for something. She ended up crying, some more harsh words were exchanged and now I feel horrible and extremely guilty because I'm the only person she has and although I feel taken advantage of, I was very mean for the words I said.

My family is well off and we are fortunate enough to go on a scuba diving trip every spring break. For the last two years my girlfriend (let’s call her Alexis) has been invited on these trips and she’s been my scuba buddy. However, over the last 6 months my parent’s relationship with Alexis has slowly deteriorated. This all started in December when my sister (30F) lost her dog and was an emotional mess. My sister (let’s call her Olivia) would call Alexis selfish and “never wanted to see her again” when she did not receive condolences from her. To be fair Alexis and Olivia did not have a great relationship beforehand and barely knew each other. Additionally, Olivia did not express her condolences either when Alexis dog passed just a few months prior. This situation led to a huge fight between my sister and I, but was eventually reconciled. However, there is still immense strain between Alexis and my family even they sided with Alexis and I. 

This summer Alexis and I are both working full time jobs. In addition I’m taking two summer classes that take up 12 hours a week. So, our schedules just don’t line up very well and we only get to see each other once a week. To add more fuel to the fire my brother (26M) was arrested and being charged with some very serious crimes. This has taken a serious mental toll on my family and I just don’t want to be around the house (he lives there) as much as possible. In consequence, Alexis does not see my parents very often. Now my parents think Alexis doesn’t like them and in turn have been very passive aggressive about the situation. For example, whenever I go out to eat with her I always pay (because she has 60k In student debt and I have none) and my parents always make some snarky comment (“why didn’t she pay”). 

Fast forward to yesterday and my parents told me “we only want to bring you and not Alexis on spring break this year” and there reasoning was “because it’s your last spring break and since we’ve had a hard year we want to spend time with only you”.  Now to me that’s just bullshit and I think they blame Alexis for all the mental strain my brother’s arrest (and a few other things) has put on my family. I know this isn’t a financial concern.

I and two other friends (F16 and F17) planned a get together as I will be leaving my hometown to settle down in a different city and they won’t see me often anymore. They usually always come to my place and I rarely go to theirs for the simple reason of they rather come to my place because they like it better. For the hangout we planned on going to the mall and then eating out somewhere and watching a movie at my house. They live closer to the mall and the place we were gonna eat so I suggested that we watch the movie at their place (they have all the streaming services that I do). This was immediately a problem and they kept insisting that we do it at my place despite me explaining that it would be easier on me if we just did it at one of theirs. There was quite a bit of back and forth but eventually they agreed to host it but one of them was adamant that I buy snacks since they were hosting, I have never once asked them to buy snacks or anything whenever I hosted something.

She's always rather complain than actually accept any advice or solutions, which has become very frustrating at times. And she complains about pretty much everything and anything.

77,1e01wf5,AITA for allowing an Uber food driver to park on a random person's drive for 3 minutes?,"I recently ordered some food from Uber Eats. I live in a block of flats surrounded by some houses.

Anyway, the Uber driver parked in a random free drive belonging to one of the house just whilst he dropped off my food. Was probably 3 minutes max. - the driver has to park somewhere, as they could get a ticket.

Within this 3 minute period, the typical late 40 bald UK ruffian male with a pit bull type dog came out and gave me and the Uber driver a massive bollocking for using his drive.

Am I the arsehole?

EDIT: It appears unanimously that I am infact, the arsehole 😅

Tbf, I didn't tell the Uber driver to park there, they just decided to and I said ""It should be fine just for a sec."" When they did already.

It is a private residence style area, so if you just randomly park on the open road, they can fine you £60 I believe. Previously, the 100+ Uber Drivers have always just parked in the available free double bay right outside my flat, literally about 5 metres. However, when I came outside to meet this driver, they had just finished parking in the neighbours driveway. I checked their profile afterwards and they only had around 200 completed deliveries, so was clearly new to Uber Eats.

Funfact though, here in the UK parking on someone else's driveway is not classed as a criminal offence... but ofc, it would make you a mega arsehole and wouldn't stop you clamping their car or having it towed 😋

REFLECTION: In future, I will ensure I will add to the delivery notes not to park in other people's drives. Thanks for the honesty everyone, even though I am getting roasted, this is my first post on this sub and it is quite wholesome to see reasoning with your comments, rather than just random berating.

78,1e01roj,AITA for refusing to give my roommate’s ex-boyfriend money for the dog he abandoned?,"So, I (20F), live with my roommate (19F). A few months back, she started dating this guy who was in a frat. He decided to get a puppy which my roommate had made very clear she didn’t want any involvement in because it is such a big decision. Especially since he wanted to buy the dog intending for it to be a ""frat dog"" that would live at the frat house. It was clear from the beginning that he had no idea what he was getting into. 

After 2 days, the not even a month old puppy was too big of a responsibility for him (waking up every hour crying wanting to use the bathroom). So, instead of finding a proper solution, the boyfriend had my roommate bring the puppy back to our apartment. She didn't want to take care of it or want the responsibility, and it became my responsibility to feed, take outside and watch the puppy. 

Eventually, she broke up with her boyfriend and has helped with the dog and expenses with me. But I have taken most responsibility for the dog. I didn't mind too much because I had grown attached to it and didn't want it to suffer being taken back to the breeder (the boyfriend has threatened to do so even though he wouldn’t get money back). I ended up keeping the dog and have been taking good care of it since then.

Fast forward to now, my roommate's ex-boyfriend contacts me out of the blue, asking for money to cover ""his share"" of the dog's expenses during the time he had it. He claims he spent a lot on food, vet bills, and other supplies, and he wants me to reimburse him. I was stunned. He abandoned the dog, and I ended up taking full responsibility for it, including all the expenses since he left.

I told him that I wasn't going to give him any money because he abandoned the dog and left me to deal with everything. Now he's calling me selfish and saying that I owe him for the time he did take care of the dog.

81,1e00lte,AITA for texting my boyfriend's male friend?,"\*throwaway account for obvious reasons\*

I, 21F, am dating my 21M boyfriend, let's call him R, for the past 1.5 years. To slip further back into time and draw context, we met in university. Almost a year into dating, my boyfriend's school friends wanted to meet me, his girlfriend, who they had heard about from R. Mind you, I had no social media contact with any of these friends and did not know them personally before I met them in person. Of the friend group, one of them, let's call him B, initiated contact over Instagram by sending a follow request on my (spam) account, which I accepted. A few casual reels' exchange and months later, we started texting back and forth, especially late into the night.

The problem begins with this. My boyfriend's ex from the same school and same friend group used to indulge into a similar thing, wherein she would text B late at night while R was an early-to-bed person and slept before she did. His ex apparently found sleeping with B hot, which R learnt about after their break-up. He now thinks that B and me talking is the exact same situation to when his ex and B used to speak, which makes him he feel like an option and therefore does not want me texting B after he goes to bed. I agreed to this condition but unfortunately could not keep it up as I am not particularly an early-sleeper and ended up texting B on multiple nights. Upon learning about me breaking the promise, my boyfriend immediately lost his mind and was gravely upset with me for it. Although I did apologize, in my defense, I am not his ex and I fully know my limits. I enjoyed texting B as a friend and I miss talking to him but it did not and would not translate into a crush because I know where my feelings lie. Since R and B have been friends longer than I have, I suggested he speak to his school friend and sort it out so that it does not affect our relationship but he does not want to ruin their friendship in any way.

So, AITA for my defense and wanting to text his friend despite his stance?

However, he still makes jokes like:""I did this stupid thing I'm so autistic"".

He isn't autistic he doesn't think he's autistic, he just thinks that people with autism are dumb and weird.

My boyfriend called him out for this behavior but he just said that he doesn't mean it. He just uses it like he would use the word ""retarded"". My boyfriend was satisfied with this answer but I was not. 

My patiance ran out when he posted a photo of him doing a silly phase with the caption ""autism at its finest""

I always liked him but I can't bring myself to talk to him after this. I just feel so disrespected. My boyfriend told me that he understands my feeling but that I shouldn't hold grudge against M. 

I texted M a moment ago that this isn't okay. So am I the overreacting asshole? 

Edit:So M left me on read and instead he messaged my bf something like:""Look, this is what your woman sent to me"". So he doesn't even have the guts to explain it to me. He rather chooses to explain that to my bf

Edit:So M texted my bf that it was only a joke that autism=gym (because the picture was taken at the gym) and that he doesn't get why did that upset me. My bf stood up for me and explained to him that if he makes a stupid face and calls it autism it makes me feel inferior. 
I was kind of disappointed that he didn't even respond to me so I texted him that if he can respond to my bf then he can respond to me too.

So I (19F) have been diagnosed with autism when I was 14. My boyfriend (23M) and his closest friends of course know it but one of them (19M), let's call him M always makes fun of autism. He doesn't make fun of me because of it. However, he still makes jokes like:""I did this stupid thing I'm so autistic"".

He isn't autistic he doesn't think he's autistic, he just thinks that people with autism are dumb and weird.

My boyfriend called him out for this behavior but he just said that he doesn't mean it. He just uses it like he would use the word ""retarded"". My boyfriend was satisfied with this answer but I was not. 

My patiance ran out when he posted a photo of him doing a silly phase with the caption ""autism at its finest""

I always liked him but I can't bring myself to talk to him after this. I just feel so disrespected. My boyfriend told me that he understands my feeling but that I shouldn't hold grudge against M. 

I texted M a moment ago that this isn't okay. So am I the overreacting asshole? 

Edit:So M left me on read and instead he messaged my bf something like:""Look, this is what your woman sent to me"". So he doesn't even have the guts to explain it to me. He rather chooses to explain that to my bf

Edit:So M texted my bf that it was only a joke that autism=gym (because the picture was taken at the gym) and that he doesn't get why did that upset me. My bf stood up for me and explained to him that if he makes a stupid face and calls it autism it makes me feel inferior. 
I was kind of disappointed that he didn't even respond to me so I texted him that if he can respond to my bf then he can respond to me too. He texted me that it was a joke and he's not willing to apologize for it. I wanted to be nice so I asked him to not do it again in the future and he responded with ""there will be some effort"".

88,1dzz3kf,AITA for snapping at mom?,"For background, I (21F) have been living away from my mom for a few years now since I moved to the States. I have not visited or seen my mother in almost 4 years, until now. I will be returning to the States next week and my mom has decided to fly back with me to spend the rest of her vacation period.

Earlier today, she came into my room and asked me to help her fill out the ESTA application since her English is very limited. But I've been hit with a bad flu for the past 2 days so I was lying in bed for the most part while she tried to fill out as much of the form by herself as possible. Occasionally, she would get stumped, hand her phone to me, and ask me what a question meant or what the next step is, to which I would always translate for her and then return the phone. Or I would just verbally answer her questions. However, the application never actually went through even after multiple attempts; it would always kick her back to the home page where she'd have to restart the form over and over again.

She got very frustrated because she wasn't sure what she went wrong (understandably so) but then she decided to direct that frustration at me. She quite literally started throwing a tantrum. She said that if I was just more ""proactive"" and stood next to her while she filled out the form then she wouldn't have potentially pressed the wrong button and that she shouldn't have to keep handing the phone back and forth between us. She was also mad because I was in bed looking at my own phone and would only sit up to help her whenever she had to ask (or according to her, ""beg"") for translations. I was shocked. I never refused to help her at any point. I thought I tried my best to help. I explained that I was in bed and that I couldn’t possibly stand next to her the entire time because I'm sick, and that I was only on my phone because I was waiting for her to finish the form and leave my room so that I can rest.

She continued, angrily saying that she just has to do everything on her own and that it was a waste of effort to raise a daughter like me, and that other children would try harder to help their parents if they were in a similar situation. It was there that I snapped, telling her that it'll be better if she just did not fly back to the States with me and that no parent would make such a big deal and lash out at their kid over something this small.

More insults and criticisms got thrown at me, and it felt like she wasn't even trying to listen to me or understand how I was feeling at the moment. I was just so upset that I started tearing up at the fact that she's getting mad at me like this over something so small (imo) despite 4 years of not seeing me, and told her to leave.

I’m aware that my retorts weren’t the nicest either, but it just really hurt to hear her say those things when I feel like her initial anger at me was unwarranted? AITA?

89,1dzyv8c,AITA for asking my bf of 6 years to get addiction help? ,"So to preface, I’m 27F & my bf is 26M & we’ve been together over 6 years. We met when I lived in his city for college & soon started dating when I moved back to my parents 2 1/2 hours away. We take turns going to each others places every weekend & have great relationships with each others families. We have had a great relationship. I have stuck beside him through mental health struggles, career decisions, and his growing addiction issues. The last 6 months to a year have really been horrible in our relationship, I barely recognize him anymore. He drinks and smokes every single day but when he drinks he gets MEAN. A few months ago I had enough & told him if he doesn’t get some sort of addiction/mental health help, I was done. He said he was going to when his insurance kicked in but has not done so. A little extra info, he has started hanging around with a lot of cocaine users & he is a person who cannot say no so that worries me. Maybe a few weeks after I woke him up when he had been drinking so I could move him to the bed he proceeded to yell at me “F*CK YOU, I HATE YOU.” That took me out even though later he said he didn’t mean it & was sleep walking (which it does take him a bit to be 100% coherent if you wake him up.) On top of that, I spoke to him about a year ago about our plan to move in together & get engaged since he wanted to propose. I told him I wanted us to both have a certain amount of money saved before we moved in together THEN I want to get engaged & I didn’t want to budge on that. (We both still live with our parents who don’t charge rent so it’s not that hard) I have been asking him since to get a savings account & actually try to save but he hasn’t done so. 
This past weekend when he was at my place, he blew up at me. I was excited for him to be here since we hadn’t seen each other in 4 weeks due to work conflicts & he went to a sports event. He was getting on me about not spending time with him when he just got there & spending time with my nephew (who is 6 weeks old.) He proceeded to tell me I treat him like my son & not even calling him by his name. He told me about his time at the sporting event, going to a club without his friends after, got in a VIP section & getting all these drinks bought for him by women. This was all in front of my parents btw then told my mother in a rant a little after about him wanting to leave me. When I pressed him about him in private & gave him an out, he said he only wants to be with me. 
I’ve gotten to the point that this weekend, I am going to break things off with him. He has done nothing that I have brought to him to help our future & I feel he resents me for making him essentially grow up. I feel extra pressure because his mom has begged me multiple times to not leave her son because they love me. I know relationships have their ups & downs & I know how great of a person he is but AITA for expecting more?

I'm a 14-year-old guy who recently started doing dancesport. I had zero experience, but a girl asked me to be her partner, so I thought, why not? I didn’t realize we were going to compete against other schools. We got third place, and I was pretty stoked. Then I found out that if we keep going, we might get a scholarship, which is huge because we really need it.

Even though I'm new, I've been getting better. Today, I found out I got the scholarship and was super happy. But when I got home, my sister totally lost it on me because of what I was wearing and how gross I looked. She said she’s embarrassed to be seen with me because I always look like a mess after practice. My practices run from 9 AM to 5 or 6 PM, so yeah, I’m tired and sweaty. The colored flooring where I practice also makes my shoes and clothes dirty, so I look pretty rough.

I get that it’s not great to look messy, but what can I do? They expect me to get home by myself because they're too lazy to pick me up. Even when they do pick me up, I have to walk to them even if they’re nearby. My sister yelled at me, saying I should wear different shoes, even though they hurt my feet. I need specific shoes for practice.

I clean my shoes, but they get dirty again because of the flooring. My sister keeps getting mad and says I look like an embarrassment. She even said that if our mom were alive, I’d look proper and neat. She threatened to stop me from dancing if I keep looking like this. It’s not like I’m dancing because I want to; I’m doing it for the scholarship to make our lives easier. But instead, I get yelled at for my clothes. I don’t have time to fix myself and look nice all the time. I have another competition this month, and she expects me to look nice while practicing, even when I’m exhausted. Plus, I have Rheumatic Heart Disease, so I’m already pushing myself. I’m tired and want to stop, but I can’t. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I've got all sorts of blends; sencha, lemon, ginger, chamomile, peppermint ect.

This wouldn't normally be an issue but went on summer holiday with extended family and my aunt decided to take issue with the boxes of tea taking up space next to the kettle. It's nothing crazy like four small teabag boxes stacked in the corner. She didn't say I had to move them or anything but she did make fun of it/make out it wasn't normal at all.

Today I was drinking some Sencha and she brought up how she can't stand green tea, because it looks like piss. I kind of blinked at her for that and went, oh, fair enough haha.

But she just kept bringing it up throughout the day calling it pissywater every time I was drinking a cup, she even make me a cup and said in a light tone here's your pissywater. So I ended up getting curt with her and going 'Ok.' in a harsh tone to her, even though she made it for me. And then I excused myself and went up the stairs and my mother came up later on and gave out to me for being so rude/over-dramatic to my aunt and that she knows the joke was annoying but that's just how she is so I need to be more mature.

Things have been kind of tense since, and my aunt keeps meeting her husband's eyes in a can-you-believe-her way every time I say anything. Did I really fuck up the house mood that bad?

94,1dzykm8,AITA for throwing away my brothers banana?,"So some context my room is in the basement. And I’m a little gremlin that doesn’t really leave my room.  

My (17nb) little brother (11m) had a science fair a couple months ago. And he decided to do his project on decomposition. And since he probably didn’t want to go scrape up some road kill off the side of the road he convinced my mom to buy a banana from the store and let it rot so he could “study” it and write down some observations. But I didn’t know about any of this. So it was about two days from the science fair and I was home alone. And on the floor I saw this rotting banana in a cardboard box on the floor. It was like completely brown and mushy. So I saw it and I just threw it away because it looked nasty and I didn’t think anything of it. A few hours later my brother came home and obviously found his banana missing. So he starts crying and screaming about how his banana is gone and how his project is ruined. I hear the commotion upstairs and the following conversation went a little something like this. 
(Me) “Hey, what’s wrong? Is (little brother) okay? 
(My mom) “yeah he’s fine, it’s just his banana is missing.” 
(Me, confused) “the disgusting banana that was rotting in the box?” 
(My mom) “Yes, do you know what happened to it?” 
(Me) “I threw it away, I thought it was just something someone forgot to throw away.” 
(My brother) “you did WHAT?” 
Then over the course of the next 30 minutes it was explained to me that that was apart of his science project and I had ruined it and I was berated by my mom and my brother. 

So AITA? I feel like he could’ve been just fine without the banana. And he did fine at the science fair. I just don’t feel like I deserved to get yelled at because of a simple mistake.

They have one apartment in our hometown where they and my younger brother lived, and one in the capital city, where I've (27F) been living for 7 years during and after college, and I payed rent to my parents (this isn't their main income, they are business owners).

My friend had been living in our hometown, but due to some events (that I can't say here directly) that led to our hometown being half destroyed, he had to flee. I moved in with my boyfriend (renting too), so I proposed my friend to move into my parent's apartment in the capital, since he doesn't have any family here and doesn't have another place to live. My family fled and lived abroad with our relatives (for free), so I thought it wouldn't be an inconvenience for anyone if I helped a friend out. My parents knew him well, so they agreed.

Initially, I wanted him to live there for free, but he offered to pay rent. We agreed he would cover the utility bills and pay whatever rent he could afford. My parents were fine with this.

1,5 years later, my parents decided to get back in the country and move to the capital to live. They didn't want their apartment back, because they found a bigger option. Their old friend left the country and wasn't planning on coming back, so he proposed them to live in his apartment for free.

After half a year, my parent's money was running low, cause they haven't been working for 2 years at that point. Despite that, they decided to renovate the apartment to then increase the rent price for my friend and also asked him to find another place to live temporarily while they make renovations. Two weeks ago, my friend found another place, which he paid a non-refundable advance for. My parents knew that.

Yesterday, my mother told me that she is preparing for a cataracts surgery, and that they won't be doing apartment renovations, but they still want to increase the rent price.

101,1dzxt0l,AITA for asking a seller to lower prices,"To start with, I found a tiktok of this really cute phone charm. I thought it was super cute and unique so I went to the seller's Instagram page. After trying to access their link to their shop I realized that they were from Malaysia and that I could only buy it via dms. It listed on the post that it was 18$ which I thought, 'hm okay not bad ig' but as I was looking through I saw that they had some other cute charms as well with no listing prices. 

On the Instagram account she said to screenshot and do of what you want. So I sent her 3 charms that I was interested in buying one was 18 and the other 2 combined was 15. So 33$ not including shipping. At first I was actually pretty content but then the more I thought about it the more I felt like I was being overcharged. I converted 33$ to Rm (Malaysia currency) and it's 155Rm. I felt like the disparity was way too big. So I ended up doing a little more digging and went back to the original tiktok and where the poster had but a link that actually worked in the comments.

It was shoppe, the prices for the charms are as followed, Rm39, and Rm22. She did say shipping costs 8Rm for the first kg though. After looking and comparing those prices I Dm'd her asking if she was willing to lower the prices she said she was willing to include the shipping fee. Her reasoning for as to why those prices are like that is because it would be unfair to the u.s sellers.

Now this is where I feel like a tiny bit of an asshole. Im not gonna lie, I still felt like it wasn't completely worth it and thought maybe I could ask to add 2 more charms while offering to pay 35 dollars. I did the math and it would bring their earing down 14Rm. They left me on read lol.

102,1dzxf2j,AITA for telling my roommate his “girlfriend” can’t stay here anymore?,"I (27m) live with my girlfriend (25f) and my childhood friend (28m). Since Jan. 2024 my roommate (well call him Justin) has been spending a lot of time with a “friend”, well call her Stacy (30f). 

Justin and Stacy have known each other for 3-4 years and have hooked up in the past but it didn’t become consistent until this year… Cool. I have no problem with that, Im happy to see him finding a companion… except he tells me he doesn’t love her, he doesn’t want to live with her, and he cares for her as a friend… this is where my frustration and confusion stems from… 

Anyway, January and February she was kinda just here on the weekends and would leave when he wasn’t here. For context, he leaves at 6am every morning for work and my gf and I work from home. Come March through May, she stayed here 24/7.. didn’t leave whether he was here or not. 

Come to find out, she’s been moving jobs a lot lately and has been suffering from severe depression… I learned this from Justin as he was going out to get her meds from the pharmacy to bring back to her. 

Fast forward to now: I told him I didn’t want her here as much and she’s been here less but Justin has become her keeper… he claims that he doesn’t want to be with her but feels bad leaving her and moving on. She can’t sleep alone so he spends every night with her whether at her place or here. She has anxiety about small things in life so he helps her keep her place tidy and picks up her medication for her. He basically is her caretaker… here’s my concern…

We will be renewing our lease come September… but Stacy’s lease is up end of August. I’m concerned that when her lease is up she’ll end up living at my place because Justin has proven to her that he will do anything for her….

105,1dzx3ln,AITA for turning a family argument into a massive situation that now involves theft?,"I (20M) come from a shitshow of a family. One of my uncles is a raging narcissist but everyone still talks to him unfortunately. I will call him Frank.

Yesterday, we had a small family dinner since it’s my grandmothers birthday. Frank and his wife Sarah are awful to Franks daughter from his first marriage, Clara (18F). I would never stop if I explained it all but all you need to know is that Clara is innocent. They hate her for no reason.

Frank hosted a family dinner yesterday and they were trying to use Clara as a servant. She had already cooked most of the food and they were trying to make her clean up. She had enough and called her stepbrother (her stepdads son) to collect her. 

I’ve met her stepbrother a few times and he’s a very nice guy, but he does not mess around about his sisters, Clara included. He used to have major anger issues but hes calmer nowadays.

Her stepbrother arrived, and Frank said that he wasn’t going to let Clara leave until she washed all the dishes. Other cousins offered to help but he said that since she made all the dishes (because she did all the cooking) she had to wash them. He then HID HER SHOES AND PHONE so she couldn’t leave. For the first time ever, my mother and other ‘elders’ were standing up to him and demanding that he let her go home but he wasn’t budging.  An argument started (you know the type where all the kids are cleared out of the room). Clara started crying, and was just going to do the dishes but I was like nah no way. 

I went outside to her stepbrother’s car, and turns out one of Clara’s cousins from her mom’s side was also there with him. They asked what was taking so long, and I informed them of the situation. This is where I might be the asshole since I knew these two would go in the house and get Clara out by any means necessary.

I let them in, and all I can say is that Clara’s shoes and phone were returned immediately. I stayed outside, and I am not lying when I say that those men shouted so loudly the windows were shaking. Her stepbrother and cousin also then took a pair of Franks shoes, TV remote and a few other things just because they could. 

Now, everyone is mad at me. My mother is saying I was an AH because they were trying to get the situation sorted which is true, that was the first time I saw anyone stand up to Frank. She said now that I got Clara’s maternal family involved, things are a million times worse. Clara’s older brother (not the stepbrother, who is also franks son who couldn’t make it to the family dinner) has completely disowned his father and is refusing to return a car and lawnmower he borrowed. They are demanding I apologize to Frank, and that I also ensure his belongings are returned to him. I don’t think I am an AH because it’s his fault he refused to let Clara go but my sister told me to post here.

So to start at the beginning of the story my grandma gave me two different soaps for my hands that she uses because we both flare up with psoriasis on our hands. She originally gave me a bar of soap and then a few months later liquid soap by the same company at this point I didn't realize how much I liked the soap so I didn't use much of it decided to switch over to the liquid because it's easier to use and less messy on the rim of the sink. the bar soap moved to the bathtub on my shelf where my razor is so I consider that to be my area. I figured if anything I could use it in the shower if need be. But before I even got 2/3 of the way through the liquid soap my bar was gone it was slowly being used I didn't really say anything because I didn't think it was that big of a deal it's soap whatever. Come to this morning I've been using the last of the liquid soap and I said something along the lines of oh the soap in the bathroom has slowly been used to my mom and she snaps in a completely different tone she goes well I've been using it on my face. And I'm like we have specific face wash in the shower why are you using that and then she goes on to say that she had her own bar that was gone and mine has been sitting in the shower for so long and why am I even saying anything it's been over a month since it's been gone. I said something along the lines of exactly I haven't said anything at all because it hasn't bothered me I was just complaining that my liquid soap was out and that there wasn't my backup that I've been saving I wasn't trying to direct anger at her at all about it.  But she goes on to say something along the lines of oh well you can always go buy a new one and I'm just going to use it to wash my face again and honestly that's kind of what pissed me off and I just walked away because I didn't want to interact. Like are you serious I'm going to buy a whole new one for my hands just for you to use it on your face get your own or just use the soap you specifically bought as face wash.

108,1dzw8qp,WIBTA for calling out a friend who asked for money for her vacation?,"Backstory: I used to be really close with a group of four girls (including me). We met on Twitter of all places and ended up becoming ""real life"" friends after everyone ended up living within an hour or so of each other. Over the years, Twitter became a super toxic place so I stopped going on much or at all, thinking all would be good because these folks are my ""real life"" friends now. Long story short, they slowly stopped responding to my texts, completely ignored me when I sent them my plans for my birthday and invited them, and one of them made a big fuss when I didn't want to spend a ton of time and money travelling to Disney (whichever one is in Florida) for her son's second birthday (told her I would love to do something with them when they were back in town and would still get him a gift but that's just not my jam). 

I recently turned Twitter back on because I miss them. I'm not being ridiculous about it but I was hoping we could gradually get close again. Even though there were the four of us that were super close and in the same area, there is a big girls group chat of all the gals around the country we got close with and would see probably once a year. There are around 20 girls in that chat.

Situation in question: One of the four main girls (we'll call her Amy) started a separate group chat (with about 15 of the 20 girls in the big group chat) excluding another of the four girls (we'll call her Chrissy) because she's taking Chrissy to Florida for her birthday next month and she wanted us all to send her money to contribute to their trip. In general, that's a really bold thing to ask a bunch of people to send you money for a trip you didn't invite them on, but I also thought it was especially bold to include me in the chat when they have pretended I don't exist for the past six months.

Don't take a vacation if you can't afford it? And I also want to call her out on the audacity of asking me in particular after we drifted.

110,1dzvyxp,"AITA for Singing ""Any Dream Will Do"" on Karaoke When My Wife Told Me Not To? ","AITA?

I (M) am 42, my wife is 39
So, last weekend, my wife and I went to a karaoke bar with her friends. I love karaoke and have always enjoyed singing a wide range of songs. I am a pretty good singer, and used to be in a rock band when I was younger. My wife knows this, but she’s always been a bit embarrassed by my choices, especially since I’m a pretty masculine-looking guy (thick beard and a lot of tattoos).

Anyway, I decided to sing ""Any Dream Will Do"" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. My wife pulled me aside and begged me not to do it, saying it would be embarrassing for both of us. I didn’t really see the big deal and thought it would be fun, so I went ahead and did it anyway.

So I did it and it went really well. The crowd was super into it, even joining in with the ""ahhh-ahh"" parts. By the end of the song, everyone was clapping and cheering. It was honestly one of the best karaoke experiences I’ve had. It was a great time.

Afterwards, a woman from the audience came up and asked if I’d sing ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with her. It was another big hit, and we got a lot of applause.

When I got back to our table, my wife was clearly upset. She said I ignored her feelings and embarrassed her in front of our friends and a bunch of strangers. I tried to explain that everyone seemed to enjoy it and that it was all in good fun, but she wasn’t having it and stormed off. The next day, she is calling me an insensitive asshole. Her friends have even said I am great fun and asked to go again. 

So, AITA?

Edit: Will respond to some comments soon, but please note I am NOT going to divorce my wife over this. It is not that deep. Please don't message me saying that. I will talk to her properly as perhaps there is something deeper to this. ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA for Singing ""Any Dream Will Do"" on Karaoke When My Wife Told Me Not To?  AITA?

111,1dzvbfs,AITA for not listening to my friend when she told me to stop drinking alcohol?,"
So this argument comes from my tolerance. I usually get tipsy after three double measures of spirits, drunk after six. As a drunk I just get flaily, excited and stumbly.

The last night out I had with a friend (Max) before this argument, I had three drinks and felt AWFUL. I got dizzy, badly hurt myself falling over and spent an hour vomiting in the club toilets. Max was bringing me water, and as soon as I'd finished vomiting I was fine, and went home with a different friend who was out with us, as I was meant to be staying with Max at one of our mutual friend's houses, and I knew I should leave. I can't say for sure, but a few people I know who've been spiked think I was as well.

On to the argument, I was talking in a groupchat with my circle about going out drinking with college friends, and Max made a joke about me vomiting so badly when we last went out. I started talking about possibly being spiked, and then Max made a comment about how she thinks my tolerance is just low. At this point, two other people came in telling me they think I'm allergic to alcohol, because they've only ever seen me have ""bad"" reactions to it. One had only seen me at house parties drinking underage, and another has only gone out drinking with me twice. No time did I hurt myself or others, or vomit. After this, Max started criticising me for a time we went out together and I only had one drink and stuck to water for the rest of the night because I felt sick - I pointed out she'd just criticised me for both drinking too much and too little when I'm out with her. I then got told I should stop drinking for a while because it's ""not good for me,"" in the groupchat that my whole circle can read, as if I'm an alcoholic - I drink 2-3 times every two months, when I go out clubbing.

I was kind of angry after this, mainly because I was being spoken to like a child who doesn't know alcohol can be bad, and I aired that in private DMs to everyone involved in the argument. They apologised for doing it in a groupchat and for ganging up on me out of the blue.

Max, however, doubled down. She said she was angry that I didn't thank her for comforting me and bringing me water on the night I was vomiting, and that it ruined her own night because she'd sobered up by the time I was finished. I can see her point, but I would happily do the same for her and not expect a thank you - I think it's part of a night out to agree to help someone who's sick. I also pointed out that I went home with another friend when I was meant to be going back with her, so she could stay out. She said she thinks I've gotten that bad ""every time I go out,"" which I know I haven't because I'm not a serial vomiter, and asked how many friends have to tell me to stop drinking for me to do it, when I've never been told this kind of thing before. We haven't spoken in two weeks.

We have discussed long-term intentions and the idea that I will eventually be their step mom.

114,1dzupmi,AITA for trying to get my husband to recover from his surgery at his parents house instead of helping him myself?,"1 week ago I had a traumatic delivery, after pushing for over 6 hours I had to have an emergency c section and delivered our first baby. on top of the pain from the c section - i pulled my back out from pushing for so long and the doctors told me i had the worst vaginal swelling they’ve ever seen - so recovering from that wasn’t fun at all either. a couple days before my due date he fractured his ankle at a softball game and got surgery for it yesterday. I’m in so much pain from tits to toes and since I didn’t have as much help from him I was forced to do a lot way too quickly which hindered my own recovery. it’s hard enough having a newborn rely on me, which i’ve been managing fine, but having my husband whine about how much pain his ankle it in and having to cater to him would not be good for my own mental health and I think he will heal way quicker if he just toughs out his hardest days with his parents so his mom can take care of him. the baby doesn’t rely on him right now and it doesn’t matter to the baby that he won’t be here even though I know he misses the baby and I understand why he wants to be here. I know that it’s my job as his wife to care for him and I wish I had more sympathy for what he’s going through but the lack of support I’ve felt during my pregnancy and delivery and post partum has just made me kind of numb to it all. that sounds horrible but this whole thing has just been very hard on me and i’m sure it hasn’t been fun for him either but these are just the cards that i’ve been dealt with and i’m trying to do what’s best for me so that i can do what’s best for our baby and the quicker i can recover the quicker i will be able to be there to help him.

EDIT: i spoke with his mom and she understands that it’s best for him to recover at least the week while he’s at his house or at least until he’s not completely bed bound. my mom has been with me and i’m not alone. he wouldn’t expect me to do anything for him and would try and be as self sufficient as possible but he almost completely wiped out in the kitchen the other day trying to clear his own plate…he did also have a major surgery and will need some help that i currently cannot provide him with and i just want what will be best for him. as for the people who think ITA for the way that i spoke of my husband… i love him with my entire heart and he is a good husband and a good father and i am aware that i  definitely do hold a bit of resentment surrounding the entire situation and the entire labor and delivery process and recovery which is just one of those it is what it is situations and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. i feel bad that he’s in pain i genuinely would never want to see him in pain but due to everything that’s happened i don’t have the sympathy to give…like hearing about how 8 hours of sleep doesn’t have him well rested or how he’s so uncomfortable it’s hard to sleep (as if i haven’t been dealing with that for half my pregnancy)…i’m also a new mom and my hormones are all over the place trying to adjust to everything. not looking for any sympathy for myself I just wanted to know if my feelings and reaction to any of this was valid.

UPDATE: a lot of the comments are shitting on my
husband or being dismissive of his pain which was never my intention from making this post. the other half of the comments i’m seeing are shitting on me for putting this out on the internet or for not having any sympathy and comparing our pain. I understand he is in a tremendous amount of pain as well and that his recovery is going to be a long one. I hate to see him in any pain at all and I do feel bad for everything he is going through but it’s hard to have sympathy when this all could have been avoided in the first place and the timing of it all was just awful.

There are days where I find it difficult to work as I feel dizzy and if I’m going to pass out. I have upcoming cardiologist and MRI appointments. I wore a heart monitor and was told my heart was beating too fast too often. I was able to secure FMLA with my job. I took two weeks off in June and then I took 2 days off this week. I just ran out of PTO so my paycheck will be smaller than usual. My fiancé is very upset about this.

118,1dzt4nq,AITA for not waiting to go dress shopping with my mum?,"Bit of backstory, my mum lives a few hours away and sees me about once maybe twice a year. She drives I don't due to medical reasons and other means of travel is too expensive for me. When I announced I was getting married she was really excited but then I started to get stressed because she started nitpicking my decisions on things so I stopped bringing wedding bits up.

 I said where I was going to have my hen party  and she said she didn't want to go because my dad's side will be there and she still feels uncomfortable after 20+ years. Then she didn't want to go dress shopping with me because my sister, cousin, step mum and auntie were going to be there but I eventually talked her down and she agreed to try. 

But a few weeks ago there was a half price sale in town so we last minute decided to look and I unexpectedly found my dress. I didn't say yes straight away because I felt bad so I messaged her with a photo to see what she thinks and she said if I love it get it. Today I got a message from her telling me how upset she was that she didn't get to help pick my dress as I'm her only daughter. 

Before the dress shopping though we've been in an ongoing argument about how my husband to be doesn't get along with my grandparents as they were horrible to him and he still doesn't want to speak to them but was letting them come to the wedding. They won't go unless he'll speak to them. I told them it was their choice to come or not. 

So for the past couple of months I have been in constant stress to tears because my mums side won't even listen to what I have to say and I was then forced to invited someone  who I've only met once to keep them happy. My mum has also complained about how many of my dad's family were invited and hers so little when she only has a small family anyway who were all invited.

119,1dzswb6,WIBTA if I renegotiated the division of costs with the other family in a joint family vacation?,"
I (f25) am a single mother to a young toddler and have been one extremely close with another young family over the course of my difficult separation. Their family consists of two parents and three children under seven, one is my child’s age. 

We have been planning a trip out of town to a relatively cheap Airbnb near some activities suited to young children. We’ll be driving up seperate cars and splitting costs 50/50. 

I agreed to the trip without really thinking about it too hard but I’m starting to have regrets. The amount of money I’ve had to spend just keeps creeping up which is hard on a single income. 

I understand funding our own fuel for each car but splitting accommodation and food costs 50/50 with a family of five seems like I’m getting the raw end of the deal. 

Wife (f26) from the other family is always making comments about the difference and in our finances and how they have it so much harder with three kids. They’ve supposedly been struggling significantly financially since their third child was born. These comments have recently increased as our travel date closes in. 

However they also have two incomes opposed to my one. So it feels very uncomfortable hearing their complaints about their finances when I’m now feeling like I’m funding their lifestyle with how they want the costs to be split. 

WIBTA if I turned around now and said something about the agreement being unfair and attempting to divide costs in a more fair way?

120,1dzsqti,AITA for not being able to stand one of my best friends,"So ive (22F) been friends with lily (22F) since we were 13. We met in our first year of high school, grew close and have been friends ever since. For the most part of these 10ish yrs, our relationship has been easy. We got along well with no problems. We werent the type to fight or bicker, our dynamic just worked. 
We were in a group of friends in high school. When she dropped out, she gradually lost contact with everyone except for me. Even at one point, I lost contact with the group too. We both went to a new school and we had just eachother. I was in the year above her at the new school since she had to repeat after dropping out. I graduated and actually ended up in contact with the our group again. Lily was still in school, so i eventually had two separate groups going on. I often asked Lily to hang out with the group again but she never wanted to because she felt awkward. I wouldn’t force her, so we continued this way till our 20s. A friend from the group, kate, planned a surprise birthday for me. She knew i was still close with Lily, kate herself had no hard feelings with Lily so she texted Lily to come to this surprise party. I was over the moon to see all my friends in the same room, and Lily agreed it wasnt as bad as she thought it would be. Eventually Lily was in the group and everything felt great. 
This is where it goes south... 
It was little things at first. Talking to me less but getting on with the other girls fine. Not including me in plans she makes. Not returning the effort i put in. I was obviously put on the back burner. I was understanding still though, and didn’t let that bother me much. She was happy, i was happy. It was all okay. 
She got a new boyfriend, Andy. his personality is not my cup of tea but he isnt abusive like her ex so i had no issues. Lily has been gradually becoming less interested in me and my life for some time now and it got worse when she got with andy. She never asks me how i am or asks what ive been up to, she only ever talks to me about herself. When she needs something or what not. Her new bf Andy is not the nicest. Example: he doesnt support the lgbtq community. Which is fine if you can keep your opinion to yourself. You do you. Just dont hurt people. Plot twist. He openly discriminated against me (bisexual) and Lily said NOTHING. Didnt defend me against HER boyfriend. He often picks at my personality and she says nothing. I put up with him to be civil. I recently had surgery with 6 weeks bed rest and she asked me how i was ONCE. however has sent me msgs about her day. About going out etc. saying it sucks that i cant do the same. Which feels like shes mocking me.
Idk if im being sensitive. Ive always done my best for her but i feel like in the past 2yrs she has gradually lost interest in me. Only showing true friendship when it suits her. Its made me resent her a bit.

My cousin have dated him since the last 4 years (2020) and still are very much in love. The thing is they have started talking about their marriage (which is a big deal in our culture). He is a good son , friend and a pretty nice brother BUT A HORRIBLE BOYFRIEND . 


Backstory: he controls everything about my cousin, from the way she dresses to the people she meets EVERYTHING. Infact he doesn’t even let her have time to herself. She works from 9 to 6:30 and she is not allowed to take her phone to her workplace so you can imagine she is exhausted in the evening but Alex starts calling her and doesn’t stop till she picks his call. One time she picked up 2 mins late (around 6:34) he was furious, they started fighting and arguing. I wouldn’t call him a gold digger as he has his own job and they earn relatively equal but I have gotten hints from him . Whenever she buys clothes it needs to be approved by him can you imagine that little shit has the audacity to control my cousin. So naturally yesterday night I sat with her and said about this all and that if she is thinking about getting married you need to acknowledge this toxic behaviour of him and tell him to stop. She was a bit sad but I just couldn’t see her being with someone so toxic . She said she will think about it . 


One more thing to note is that Alex is literally thaw definition of man child. Being a 26 year old man he gives all his salary and finances to his mom and she manages all of it . When I said to my cousin that after they get married what will happen to that arrangement she said that Alex will continue with this.

126,1dzqaxd,AITA for telling someone at a concert to tone it down?,"Sorry on phone. I (32M) went to a blink 182 concert with my fiancee and her sister. We bought really good tickets for pretty cheap from the box office. I believe they were like 300$ online and got them for 80$. 

The issue started with the opening bands. Pierce the veil came out. And the girl behind me would screech. She would scream and then her pitch would go super high at the end. My right ear was literally hurting. I wasn’t the only one bothered, my fiance and her sister were also uncomfortable. Legit still hurts as I’m writing this. She did this a few times. 

When the band took a small break I turned around and said “wow you yell super loud do you mind lowering it a bit it’s hurting my ear” I tried saying it jokingly as to not make it a big thing. But she instantly took offense. She look young in her 20s or teens and she was there with some guy. But the conversation we were having wasn’t too intense until her boyfriend or friend started talking. He started telling me to fuck off and I should’ve stayed at home. Which got me heated and I started cussing him out. 

The girl told me that she was going to do whatever she wanted to do. She paid the same amount as me and if her screaming upsets me too bad. Which leads me to believe she paid 300$ .I turned around and thought for a bit more. Then approached her again I reached out my hand and apologized and said my name is John (not real name) I said if she can nudge my chair or tap me on the shoulder when she’s going to scream so I can at least cover my ears. All while her friend was telling her to ignore me consistently. She said she was here for the bands and not for me. I took my loss and decided to enjoy what I can. 

She screamed a few times and when pierce the veil ended the couple left. Honestly I was upset more towards the guy he’s the one that got me heated and escalated the situation I was just trying to have a conversation. I thought of a few ways to be petty and one was to stand up through the whole show and block their view, I’m a pretty tall guy, and look back and say I’m here for them not you and tell them If they don’t like it to go home. 

Blink 182 came out and I decided to forget about it and enjoy the show. My petty plan would not have worked anyways because everyone was standing lol. The problem though was they came back and they were sitting. They looked super bummed and miserable. I felt like maybe I was just being a grandpa asking some kids to be more quiet. I do understand people go to concerts to have fun and it’s going to be loud. Maybe I don’t know proper concert etiquette either. This was my second concert. They only stayed for one more song and just left. So I feel bad I ruined someone’s night and they wasted a lot of money because of me. Maybe I’m old and next time I’ll just bring earplugs. Cause my ear is aching super bad. 

Edited: added paragraphs sorry on mobile. Also I guess I should be more clear she was not yelling like the lyrics it was more of a “woo”/ scream from like a scary movie. I wanted to use the word screeching but idk if that would make it biased. It wasn’t that I was overstimulated or uncomfortable by loud sounds. I was screaming and being loud myself. It’s just to me she took it to a way other level. Honestly it felt like she was breaking the sound barrier lol 

Edit: https://youtu.be/dOcYTOBA0CI?si=iT2npC-pLUpTCSCU

This is the closest I could get to it. It started with a wooooo and then turned to the same pitch of screaming in the video. To help clarify.

Last edit. I think the general consensus is that I’m NTA. But I was convinced that it’s more ESH. I could’ve approached it in a better light. As someone suggested I could’ve offered her my seat. That way she could be closer to her favorite band and I would be free from her screeching directly into my ear. I feel like maybe we both would’ve been happy. No one likes being told they are too loud. 

The only thing is there were 3 of us and 2 of them. So maybe it wouldn’t have worked but at least it’s a step in a better approach. Also I will definitely bring EARPLUGS. Next time. I understand concerts get loud. I just didn’t think I’d have someone screeching in my ear consistently. That I would need them. Now I know. And I learned. This was my second concert ever so forgive me if I’m not as experienced.

127,1dzpxm4,AITA for attending work social events?,"I have recently started a new job. It's the job I wanted since I left university so I'm excited to be doing what I want to do. There were 3 other people who started at the same time as me. It's a job in the council in the UK so it's a local government job with a lot of different departments.

 I have been placed in the department I wanted as it is seen as the most interesting. When I met the team for the first time and met the other new starter who was joining this team I realised I knew her. 

We had matched on Tinder while at university and got on one date. We had sex but decided that neither of us really do it going anywhere so left it at that and didn't see each other again. 

The manager of the team mentioned that the team like to go on socials around once a month. He said these tend to be either just going for drinks or going bowling, laser tag, go karting etc. This sounded really fun to me so I told him I'd definitely be at all of the socials that I'm available for and so did the other new starter.

When I got home my girlfriend asked how m day was, I told her about meeting the team and about the other new starter and how I knew her. I also mentioned the social events. 

My gf said I should not be going out drinking with someone I have had sex with. I pointed out it was years ago and I can't exactly avoid my colleagues. I said I'm not turning down social events because of a colleague for no reason. 

My girlfriend said I was being unreasonable and disrespectful and should not be going.

128,1dzpkb1,AITA for not helping my best friend and his fiancé while they face homelessness?,"So my best friend who ive known for years and have been more involved with his family than my own has hit a rough patch. He lost his job and his health has been in decline. The medical bills are burning through his savings and it's looking like he won't be able to afford rent this month. 

Now, I love him as a brother, more than any of my own blood. His mother was always good to me and he hasn't wronged me in any way that couldn't be patched up. I would do anything for him. I've even offered to let him stay with me and I'd help him get healthy and back on his feet like his mother did for me in the past. But there is a condition, his fiancé would be on her own and not welcome in my home.

See, I also have a history with his fiancé. One that goes back further than the one between me and my friend. We went to high-school together where she didn't just bully me but went out of her way to ruin me and try to end my life there. I faced legal charges due to her, physical harm because of her, complete and utter isolation because of her and ultimately had to change schools because of her. All because I was the weird new kid who tried to make friends in her circle and tried to stand my ground against her.

She spread false lies that I was a pervert taking pictures of girls as they changed, that I was trying to take pictures under their skirts. She'd come up to anyone I hung around with and say I hurt animals, that I spoke about heinous actions. It was so bad I was attacked by other students and completely isolated. I even had to deal with the police when the staff caught wind of what i was supposedly doing. 

Conveniently she doesn't remember me or anything she did. That aside she hasn't really changed since then. She's been a terrible influence on him constantly trying to pull him back to be a loser like she is. 

I've put up with her over the past year since they met and got together because I hope people can change and I want to respect my friend. However anytime she's around it takes alot of effort to not be an outright dick to her, to not act on the rage and trauma she caused me. I know I wouldn't be able to tolerate her for 2 days in my home.

I recently told him about all the issues of the past between her and I when I gave him the stipulations for the first time. So I want to help him, but he's freaking out on me for holding what happened in high-school against her now especially given the situation. I'm trying to stand my ground but I can't help but feel I'm failing him somehow because I can't get over the rage and trauma she causes me. So AITA?

I've never after all these years been okay with what he and my mom did to our family. Fast forward to a couple years back my mom and Greg decided to get married. This made me sick because now my cousins would become my brothers/sisters through this marriage. This was a large pill for me and my siblings to swallow. But we did it for our mother. 
  Now, I am here planning my own wedding, and the only thing I can think is how do I tell my mom I don't want the man who my Mon is married too that I don't want him to be there on MY Special day. I want my real Dad and mom there without the man that helped ruin a family. So I Don't know if anyone has any advice on how to approach this scenario, but I'm open to suggestions.

130,1dzpb7a,AITA for telling my brother to dump his pregnant gf?,"My (41F) little brother (38M) has a penchant for loving “crazy” women. He's FAR from perfect, a total “bachelor”, a bit immature, but has a heart of gold. It’s a pattern: he loves broken women, tries to fix them, drama follows. 

Enter the latest girlfriend. My brother started seeing a woman a year ago, a divorced mother of two, around the time he moved in with my parents to recover from knee surgery. He said he wasn’t in to her, just for while he’s in the area. My parents have only seen her in the driveway a handful of times. Something is off, he normally loves loudly, includes them in family functions or dinners. Parents say they are off and on every other week and it's an explosive toxic relationship.

I’m visiting and he comes home from work and says he wants to show us something. It’s a FUCKING SONOGRAM. I haven’t even met this woman and I know my brother IS BY NO MEANS MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY prepared/wants to start a family. 

Two min later in walks the gf. We get to know her, she’s sweet. She shares some things with me: how hard it is to connect with my brother, to get him to commit, how he wasn’t happy at first hearing she was pregnant and it was an accident - birth control pills didn’t work. She stays for dinner. She talks crap about her ex and how she has sole custody, how her eldest son is severely disabled and she earns her living on state income caring for him, that he’s her angel. 

She leaves with me knowing that she’s a GREAT mom, and that my brother is going to go from independent bachelor to a father of 3. 

Days later shit hits the fan. Gf has set up a photo shoot to announce their pregnancy on Instagram with her other 2 kids and my brother. She told him to get a hair cut, shave, and wear all white. She’s 13 weeks pregnant, they don’t live together, he’s never been involved in caring or interacting with her kids. He’s convinced it’s for the ex, he also is 100% anti-instagram anti-share every aspect of your life and despises the idea of “doing a cheesy family photo”. 

He starts sharing the reality of their relationship, text messages where she is berating him, insults, cussing, threats of destroying his life, NARCISSISTIC CONTROL AND GAS LIGHTING. She is clearly emotionally and verbally abusive. He clearly is not throwing back the insults but sumbmitting and taking it. Break ups and silent treatment for weeks, then dragging/crawling back. Horror stories of unhinged behavior over the last year, in front of my dad (storming out of driveway when brother is helping my father in garage longer than expected, not allowing my brother to go camping with my dad, or visit me and my family - I live in EU with my husband and kids).

Then the real clinger: my brother admits she’s been BEGGING HIM FOR A BABY FOR MONTHS. He was adamantly NO! He doesn’t want marriage or to start a family. He says she’d “beg” him for a baby every day, THEN JOKE ABOUT “WHAT IF I GET OFF BIRTH CONTROL haha”. She forcefully entrapped him into becoming a father UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM AND AGAINST HIS WILL?! He says he’d rather die than live in a house with her and her other kids in “xyz town”. She fucking scammed him! 

My mind is exploding with every revelation. Also with the sheer IDIOCY of my poor fool of a brother. 

Hours before said photo shoot the only advice I gave him: don’t do the photo today, tell her to wait till she’s 8 months. 

He apparently doesn't do the photo and escapes town for a few days resulting in their 100th breakup. My parents are convinced 50/50 he’ll go back to her. So AITA for wanting to tell my brother to stay the hell away (outside of the child?)

Edit to add: how does my family interact with gf, do we pretend and ignore abuse and toxicity for sake of future nephew/grandson relationship? 
Also to clarify: my AITA wanting to tell him to stay away from her is because of clear verbal and emotional abuse that no one should ever tolerate, not because he is having a kid. Before ""shit hit the fan"" I congratulated him, talked about parenthood, and told my mom to stay out of it, while thinking to myself maybe this will make him finally grow up. During his ""revelations"", I remained neutral and didn't react to him, didn't even speak, just listened. Yes I realize our involvement at all is TOXIC, I didn't ask or want to know ANYTHING. This is an on going cycle with him of including us in his ""heart breaks"". This AITA is my personal reaction in my head and then later in private with my parents. We are all shocked and lost on how to react to him/them and how they became pregnant. And I sincerely am asking if I am an asshole for wanting to finally confront him and get involved and break up a potential family BECAUSE she's abusive. OBV my brother is an asshole too!

We have a family discord server for gaming. Occasionally my BF’s brother and nephew say the N word during calls which makes me feel Weird but I’ve never brought it up to avoid conflict. Anyway the nephew who I’ll call Luis posted a joke where he named his Fallout character “nicker” and said, and I phrase, “my racism got to me as always”‬ and how whenever someone asked to trade for nicker he cracked up.

This is where I drew the line and told him I didn’t find racist humor funny. He threw a hissy fit, said nothing to me but complained in my BF’s DMs and deleted me on Facebook. 

Fast forward to last Friday. My phone gets pickpocketed coming out of a concert and so do 3 other people’s phones. This isn’t the first time my phone gets stolen. I am livid and use my sibling’s discord to let my BF know what happened in the server. I end up venting angrily, saying that I hate rats thieves and also  Mexicans. Why? Because crime is so common in Mexico. It’s so normalized, they take these stolen phones to giant hubs ran by organized crime where they jailbreak them or sell their parts. 

Anyway, days later Luis says “I hate Mexicans is wild and i thought i was a racist POS ig not 😂.” Clearly he’s still angry even though it happened months ago. This time, BF’s brother who I thought I was on good terms with joins in and starts calling me racist. Apparently Mexican is a race and racism is hatred against minorities or something. They keep insisting I am ignorant and racist. I suspect what I said didn’t make them uncomfortable but they want to make a point that I am a hypocrite. 

Am I the asshole?

TL;DR Luis made a racist joke about black people on a discord server, I called him out because it made me uncomfortable since it was super rude. Months later my phone is stolen and in an angry outburst while venting I say that I hate Mexicans rats and thieves. He takes this chance to call me a racist and an ignorant POS and someone joins in agreeing with him.",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-10,"AITA for what I said about Mexicans after my phone was pickpocketed?

133,1dzomyo,AITA for not defending a disabled person from a bully (and causing the bullying),"A tiny bit of backstory, I am in my junior year of highschool, and currently I am working through contamination OCD that started freshmen year. The school year has ended, but I can't seem to get this event out of my mind.

There is this kid, let's call him David, and he's in the special needs classes most of the time.  Except for art class, which we are both in.  David and I get along pretty well, we have talked a few times (though it is difficult to understand what he is saying at times), overall, I think he's pretty nice.  

Then one day I'm in the restroom, in a stall, and suddenly liquid begins pouring in a stream on the ground.  At first I thought it was water, and someone was pranking me, but no, it became very apparent that it was warm pee.  It splashed all over me, my pants, my shoes, even a bit on my shirt.  I yell to whoever just peed on me to leave, and I hear his voice.  He asked me not to tell anyone and I told him and I absolutely would be telling the office to at least clean up, he tried to reason with me and after a while I just began responding ""please go away, David"" until he left.  

I first went to my art teacher, since he has cleaning supplies and he's a teacher I can trust.  He asked what happened and I told him the situation, to which he (somewhat unprofessionally) told me he's heard rumors of David peeing on the bathroom floor outside a stall or urinal.  I then, after getting some wet wipes, went to the office, trying not to have a panic attack because of my OCD.  When I got there, a group of students were inside and asked me if I was okay, I told them that someone had peed on me in the bathroom, and that I was cleaning up before I freaked out because of my OCD; they of course, asked who peed on me, I wasn't thinking, and was almost crying, so I told them the truth, that it was David.  I then went home to shower.

Fast forward a couple days, and the story of a student with OCD being peed on by David has spread.  Worse of all, a diss track was made of him, most of the lyrics were about the incident.  I didn't support it, but I didn't do anything to stop it either.  I feel like I should have stood up for him, told everyone that I was fine and that I don't blame him.  He didn't deserve the bullying, and I didn't tell the principal about the diss track until after the year had ended.  I don't know why I didn't do anything, I'm not angry at David in any way, but for some reason I let him get teased by the whole school, all because I basically tattled on him to other students.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA for not defending a disabled person from a bully (and causing the bullying) A tiny bit of backstory, I am in my junior year of highschool, and currently I am working through contamination OCD that started freshmen year.

134,1dzoacz,AITA for white knighting my sisters boyfriend and saying she should treat him with respect?,"I love my sister and sometimes she is the most amazing person on the planet. But other times... she is the opposite of that.

She has a problem where her opinion is always the right opinion. If I like a band she doesn't like, she will look down on her and act like her opinion is better and I'm stupid.

We were hanging out with a group of friends. I was talking to my sisters bf about a show we both watched and didn't like.

My sister immediately said we were wrong and stupid for our opinion. I said we weren't stupid, we just didn't like it. She asked why and I and her bf said we couldn't explain it, the show just didn't click with us.

She said we were stupid for the opinion. The show is clearly too complex for us to get, and we also couldn't explain our opinions, which makes us even more dumb.

I was the one mostly arguing with her, but I told her that we aren't dumb, it just didn't vibe with us, it's a personal opinion.

She said it was OUR problem. We were stupid and that's why we didn't get it.

I hate when she acts like this, she gets into such a superiority complex and it fucking pisses me off.

It was mostly us arguing back and forth and her bf was quiet. But now he asked, ""So you think I'm stupid?"" He sounded so hurt. It really hurt my heart.

You'd think my sister would have dropped it, but she doubled down. She said yes, you're dumb, it's just my opinion. It turned into them arguing back and forth.

Her bf was saying he was hurt by what she said and upset she was calling him stupid, and she was saying it was her opinion, she is allowed to have opinions.

But unlike me he didn't seem madc just sad. I hate to see people mistreated, so it just broke my heart. But he ended the argument with, ""Fine. I'm stupid. We'll just drop it.""

But I couldn't just drop it. I told my sister that I was disgusted by the way she just talked to him. I said it's fine with her to have an opinion, but you should NEVER call your partner stupid, especially in front of your friends. You should never insult them. I said you should treat your partner with respect, and I am upset by her lack of empathy.

I don't know how but she managed to turn the whole thing around at me. She said she was getting pissed, and I needed to stay out of her relationship. 

What really hurt is her bf stood up for her. He said I was white knighting. If his gf wants to call him stupid, he's a grown man and can handle it. He doesn't need me to help, and I shouldn't speak for him.

I felt so fucking hurt and betrayed. I said he was being abuse victim vibes, defending the person who just shit on him in front of her OWN FAMILY and HER FRIENDS. It got heated after that and they were so upset I called her abusive. Our night ended after that, but she said she can never forgive me for saying that.

Not long before he came over to meet them I found out that my bestfriend and him had kissed once in middle school over a game of truth or dare, me and her have been to multiple different schools due to moving a lot so it’s not like they’ve known each other well for years. 

He came over and when she got there, she hid in the closet pretty much the entire night saying she had a bad night at work and wanted to be alone, her being upset over something small and making a big scene, wasn’t exactly new to any of us. 

He said he didn’t drink and once he finally gave into the peer pressure he started being a d*ck to me and then left. 

Despite me begging her not to, she made an awful post about him on Facebook and tagged him in it for everyone he knows to see. He ended up blocking me on everything and I dropped his stuff off outside his home with a letter apologizing. He ended up reaching out and we made up. 

Our other bestfriend cut her off not long after for a different reason and apologized for going along with what she did. So him, our other bestie, her bf and my mom and sister all pleaded with me that she was a bad friend for that and multiple other reasons and wanted me to cut her off. 

I ended up texting her politely talking about how I wasn’t okay with what she’s did. She got really defensive and hostile and had no intention of deleting the post. It’s still up to this day. I was bawling my eyes out (though she couldn’t see) and she knew how sensitive and non confrontational I am. I have never once heard her apologize or admit her wrong doings except the one time she broke my phone on accident in a fit of rage. So I knew this conversation wasn’t going to a good place because I’ve witnessed how she treats people when she upset and it seemed she was using bad faith tactics. I ended the conversation because I couldn’t handle the hostility and she knew I was sensitive to the point of easily being triggered and experiencing SI due to so much emotional abuse. And I knew that she knew better than anyone what to say to hurt me. Our other friend confirmed when I ended the conversation she said “yeah that’s what I thought”. 

I later ended up cutting her off because the guy I was dating pretty much ended up saying he wasn’t comfortable with our friendship, but I had other reasons, that was just the last straw. I’m no longer dating him because he is indeed toxic. But that doesn’t change the fact that she didn’t respect my boundaries and that she got hostile with me despite me going into the conversation with good faith and knowing how fragile I am and not only not caring about my state of mind but also seeming to take advantage of my sensitivity, vulnerability and trauma.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA for choosing a guy over my bestfriend My exbestfriend had recently gone through a rough brakeup with her toxic bf.

M went low, I called him out, he has avoided me since. I\`m not a concise writter, so I had to edit out the context part (we have been living together for almost a year, there is back story), but Monday was flat checks / cleaning inspections, only F2, M, and I were home, this is the group chat chain from Sunday (1,5 hours ish), directly quoted:

* I: Flat checks tomorrow, how do you guys want to split it?

M: Well you need to clean the floor in the kitchen... otherwise it\`s just the dishes which is no problem really

* I: I can do the kitchen floor and the hallway in the same go. There\`s also the bathrooms.

M: Sure do the floors ... thats really the only thing...

M: I cleaned last week

M: And the dishes are mainly F2

M: Some of mine

* I: Cool, still bathrooms

M: Then its good

* I: I propose someone does the big bathroom, one person does the toilet and quickly wipes over the kitchen counters, and one person does all the floors and takes out the recycling.

M: I do this all the time (insert my name) haha

* I: I recognise and appreciate the cleaning you do, I have not stated or believe you don\`t, rather that that’s true for us others as well. I do not appreciate you incorrectly implying otherwise, or the tone you’re using, it’s unfair to us others and unhelpful. If you experience that the cleaning and trash etc. etc. is unbalanced, that is a valid concern, I acknowledge it, and personally feel it’s something we would benefit from addressing.

138,1dznvbi,AITA for threatening my roommate over lice? ,"I (22F) share a bedroom with one other girl Tai (21F). We both moved abroad for our further education. I moved about 10 months ago, while she just recently moved in with me about 2 weeks ago. We have another girl living with us in the other bedroom, let’s call her Lara (24F). Lara and Tai belong to the same community so they have really bonded in the 2 weeks Tai has been here. 

When Tai had just moved in, she apparently noticed that I had a lot of boxes tucked under my bed, which she found “unclean”. Most of the boxes had clothes, and other wearables that I had no space in my closet for. They were all neatly tucked under my bed, and weren’t imposing on her side of the room at all. She felt uncomfortable to directly approach me with this, so she talked to Lara who then proceeded to berate me about how it doesn’t feel good to look at, and that I should clean it up or Tai might move out. This ticked me off, but I did get an extra organizer from a thrift store to put the stuff from boxes into. I also told Tai to directly approach me if she has any qualms about sharing a space with me. 

Flash forward to a week ago, I noticed Tai sitting on her bed using a specialized comb and then squashing something. On a closer look, I realized they were lice. The comb that she was using is definitely from our home country, I could tell from the shape and structure of the bristles. So this isn’t something she caught here, she flew internationally with lice in her hair and didn’t bother informing us about her situation. I panicked immediately. I am very particular about hygiene, and plus, I am interning at a healthcare site that is very strict about presentation and things like this(obviously lol). Anyway, I checked myself for lice, but I seem to be okay so far. I spoke to her and told her to get treated, reminding her that she has insurance that will cover it. She seemed kind of bothered by it, and just replied with a “hmm okay”. Two days pass, and she’s still using her comb, no medicated shampoo, no treatment, nothing. I approach Lara, who turns out, knew about the lice. She tells me it’s her business, and up to her if she wants to pursue treatment. This pissed me off, especially after she made a big fuss about some boxes under my bed making the room “unclean”. Apparently lice are not. 

Resigned, I approach Tai again to remind her. She just says “okay” again, and I get pissed. I tell her point blank that if she doesn’t get treated within this week, I will kick her out of the house. My landlord hasn’t made the new lease yet, so it won’t be a problem. She starts crying and then Lara tells me I bullied her, adding that she’s from a small village and doesn’t live a privileged life like me. I don’t understand how that relates to anything, but I feel teamed up on. However, I’m not sure if I did too much by threatening her. Aita?

Usually very important stuff. she also keeps stealing my items I’ll find my stuff in her purse, plus she also moves all my stuff around despite me asking her not to. the accumulated hours of stress and frustration over the past few months over never being able to find anything I own when I need it is causing me severe stress daily. I’m also on the spectrum and it sends me into a meltdown. I’ve told her this. But she refuses to respect that and today as I was in and out of the ER trying to juggle work at my daughter she offered to come help and she starts completely rearranging everything again snd I finally said to her that I’ve asked her probably a dozen times at this point not to move my stuff and now everything I’ve sorted and put into piles is now entirely jumbled up and it’s sending me over the ledge today. 

It was important because I had piles of stuff that had to be returned to certain places and I had stuff packed for a trip and now it’s all in different places now. I went through a spurt of having to spend my time and money repairing things she breaks because she’s constantly breaking my stuff too. Money to replace things she throws out. Then I said while I’m talking about being disrespected here are like 3 other major things that are causing me major stress lately that are related. I told her how it’s not ok that I’ll tell my daughter no then she’ll go above me and tell her no it’s ok. Stuff like that. 

She started telling me I need to stop with the new age enlightened bs therapy language and that I focus too much on the negative and she won’t listen to me. She said my place is inhabitable (there’s reasonably moving boxes everywhere and sorted piles of stuff to get rid of and pack, it’s all temporarily) so she’s “required to rearrange my entire apartment”. She said she’s not allowed to have rules because she’s my mom and she’s simply trying to help. She told me I’m making issues out of stuff that isn’t actually an issue and I’m not allowed to bring up stuff from the past because it’s now it’s the past and that’s just focusing on the negative and she refuses to listen to anything she did in the past because it’s over now and that doesn’t work for her. So I said ok then in the future here are the rules going forward if you want to be in my house and she left and said she’s not coming back because she won’t step foot in my house if she has rules and I’m being unreasonable.

145,1dzn1v5,AITA for telling a friend to stop watching so much p*rn?,"I (19F) have a twin brother who I am very close to. Lets call him J. We hang out together a lot and I consider him to be one of my best friends.

We became alot closer during highschool when we found out we were both bisexual. Making friends doesn't come easy to me and I really only have 2 close friends. 3 if you count my best friend's childhood friend that hangs out with us sometimes. My twin is very social and has a bigger group of friends that he hangs out with all the time since most of them go to the same college. 

Last week when we were hanging out with some of our mutual friends from highschool one of them made a comment about my shirt, saying it looked like one my brother had in highschool. I told her it was the same shirt and she gave me a kind of weird look. I brushed it off because I didn't think she meant anything by it. My brother and I sometimes share clothes because we have a similar enough style and are about the same height and build. For us it just means we have a lot more clothing options. 

Yesterday, I ran into that same friend after one of my classes and we stopped to talk. My brother called me in the middle of our conversation to ask if I wanted food since he was ordering anyway and before I hung up I said ""Bye, I love you."" He said it back and my friend gave me a strange look. She didnt say anything at first but then when I asked her what was wrong she said it was just strange that I said I love you to my brother. I laughed it off and asked her if she didnt say it to her siblings. She said no because that was weird. 

I didn't know what to say so I just left it there and told her I needed to go so I could meet J at home before he left for his friends house since they were planning on hanging out. She then started talking about how weird our relationship was and how it wasn't normal for siblings to share clothes or say i love you, hug, hang out so much or do any of the things we do. And how highchool was weird since we were always together and talking to eachother. 

She also brought up a comment I made in highschool In response to a question about what I woud do if my twin died. I said that I didn't think I could live without him because he was a part of me. This question was asked to another set of twins we were friends with and they both had the same answer. 

The whole time she was going on, i just stared at her because I really couldnt believe what I was hearing. Eventually she stopped and I just blurted out, ""You know you should really stop watching so much p*rn."" 

She was very embarassed and went off at me for saying that. I just left and went home. I told J what happened and he just laughed at me while I felt like I was dying inside because I couldnt believe I said that. I asked my friends what they thought and they laughed at me and told me i'm not the asshole but I still feel like am. So AITA?

They did not (and still do don’t) really see it as an issue to smoke in the house. 

My parents moved 3 provinces away from where they raised me to live where my grandmother lives and grew up in 2021. 

Prior to becoming a parent, I did not tell my parents what to do in-regard-to smoking in their home. While cleaning their last home to sell, I mentioned it would be wise to refrain from smoking in their next home. But I digress. 

After having my daughter (5), my nonnegotiable has always been no smoking in the car or house while we are visiting. Their convenience is not worth my daughter having secondhand smoke. 

Usually, I mention to my parents that “hey, we’re coming down in x weeks. Could we please try to refrain from smoking in the house” this always stirs up drama. 

We’ve been visiting for about a week, they admit to having smoked in the house the day we arrived. Not surprised, but not happy either. My mother and father both still smoke in their  bedroom while we visit.

No matter how many times I explain to her that it does not have to do with the smell, is exhausting. She doesn’t understand that is lingers and stays in the air, furniture, walls, etc., 

Her go to response is always “well, we always smoked in the house with you and you were fine” and the good ole “it’s my house, I’ll do what I want” argument. 

This time she said that I was being unreasonable and incredibly inconsiderate. To which I responded that “yes, I’m not considerate to your smoking. I’m considerate to my daughter’s health. If you cannot stop smoking at least while we are visiting, we will go stay somewhere else” 

She became incredibly upset about this. Maybe it’s important to mention that she’s a narcissist. Anyways. AITA for threatening to stay elsewhere because they refuse to stop smoking in their house while we visit.

148,1dzml9y,AITA for telling my brother to dump his pregnant girlfriend?,"Where to begin? First ever post. My (41F) little brother (38M) has a penchant for loving “crazy” women. It has always been this way, they were crazy girls and now it’s crazy women.  It’s one of the few topics we have ever bonded over through the years, with him actually opening up and calling me with a broken heart. And don’t get me wrong, my brother is FAR from perfect, he is a total “bachelor” at heart, forever young, always with the guys, spends too much money on dumb stuff, slightly irresponsible and selfish, a bit immature, easily snippity, but he also has a heart of gold and can be so gentle and joyful. But it’s a pattern: he loves broken women, he tries to fix them, rescue them, believe in them. These relationships usually last a few years…The “nice” girls never last beyond a couple months, don’t get a commitment…it’s only the crazies. It’s not that I have ever told him LEAVE HER! It’s usually at the start of the true, no-coming back FUCKED UP demise that he desperately gets me involved, needs my help, needs my support, his sounding board into walking away or asking me to step in and “fix it”. Which I do - I am the family fixer after all. But never before that call. I respect his choices until he waves the white flag, I am friendly with all the girl friends. Up until now. 
Enter the latest girlfriend. My brother “temporarily” moved in with our parents for knee surgery. He has lived 7 hours away for the last 15 years and needed help recovering, it was a work place accident and involved workman’s comp, over a year and a half of physical therapy and a big settlement so about a year ago he starts “app-dating” in the area. I was home visiting last summer and he had recently started “hanging out” with a woman, a divorced mother of two. He said he wasn’t in to her (to rephrase his unkind words), it was just for now until he goes back to his life down south… Cue first drama of this saga: he comes home in his brand new jeep with his door kicked in and completely dented. It was the ex-husband. He never brought her around (which is unheard of - he brings every minor and major female interest around.) And during the last year I haven’t seen or heard too much more (I live out of the country). Fast forward to my annual summer trip home. My mom and dad say they break up every week and he doesn’t seem to care. She still doesn’t come around, has been to zero family events, dinners, hang outs. My mom LOVES everyone, but she doesn’t like this woman for my brother, but she can fake it 100%, has seen the woman pull up a handful of times and says hello, that my brother usually will sleep over there when they’re “good” but is usually home or at work, and virtually all of his belongings are here…anyway, when my brother is in love he loves loudly. But he’s as quiet as a fucking mouse. It’s just fucking weird. I can’t get a reading from anyone. First day into my trip home this summer my dad says my brother tells him he’s looking for a house to rent locally with her - and my parents are shocked. Two days into my trip he comes home from work and says he wants to show us something. My mom and I are like what?! I was thinking it was something for his dune buggy he’s fixing up, my mom thinks it’s a puppy. It’s a FUCKING SONOGRAM. I haven’t even met this woman and I know my brother IS BY NO MEANS MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY prepared/wants to start a family. BUT we’d all never say that. It was the most shocking unexpected thing I’ve ever heard in my life!  We all basically said holy shit! My mom hugged him! My dad asked if he was going to marry her (no! He says!). We were all shocked (not negative comments but not congrats either). He doesn’t know how many weeks she is. Two minutes later in walks the girlfriend. We get to know her. She is sweet, and friendly, trying to connect with my two girls and is sporting QUITE the baby bump. She’s 13 weeks - which is clear on the sonogram, but she looks 6 months. And she says my brother was waiting to tell us when I got home. She shares some things with me (how hard it is to connect with my brother, to get him to open up and be emotional, how he wasn’t happy at first hearing she was pregnant and it was an accident - birth control pills didn’t work). I got a weird feeling BUT I kept my mind open. This woman is my new sister in law and I will accept her and try to connect with her like all the others. She stays for dinner (first time!), she stays late and we chat. She talks crap about her ex-husband (weird) and how she has sole custody. She talks about how her eldest son is severely disabled and she earns her living on state income caring for her son, that he’s her angel. She leaves with me knowing that she’s a GREAT mom, and that my brother is going to go from independent bachelor to a father of 3. It’s a lot aka MIND FUCK! The next day I apologize to my brother for being so shocked and tell him congrats and hug him. Three days later shit hits the fan. My brother comes home and is pissed and freaked - he’s venting to my mom. Girlfriend has scheduled a professional photography shoot to announce their pregnancy on Instagram. It’s been in the books for weeks/months. It’s with her other two children and my brother. She told him to get a hair cut, shave, and wear all white. She is 13 weeks pregnant, they don’t live together, he’s never been involved in caring or interacting with her kids, and again she is THIRTEEN WEEKS PREGNANT. I know lots of people do pregnancy announcements and professional family photos, but I have NEVER seen a single friend do one on virtually the day after the first trimester. My red flag alarm bells go sounding off. I am only listening, my mom is talking him through it. He’s convinced it’s for the ex husband, he also is 100% anti-instagram anti-share every aspect of your life and despises the idea of “doing a cheesy family photo”.  He is on a roll now with the flood gates, showing the reality of their relationship, the text messages where she is berating him, insulting him, cussing him out, calling him a dead beat, the threats of destroying his life, making him regret he was ever born, the NARCISSITIC CONTROL AND GAS LIGHTING. Holy shit, the quantity and length of messages is NEXT LEVEL. Several novels were written in the span of their one-year on-and-off fling. She is clearly emotionally and verbally abusive. He is somehow clearly taking the abuse and submitting to her controlling demands and irrational explosions. My parents say it’s been this way the last year…whaaatt??! Then the real clinger here: my brother admits she’s been BEGGING HIM FOR A BABY FOR MONTHS. He was adamant about it, no! He doesn’t want marriage or to start a family. They’d break up. He’d go back. He says she’d “beg” him for a baby every day, THEN JOKE ABOUT “WELL WHAT IF I GET OFF BIRTH CONTROL haha”. Holy shit my gut instinct on the back patio in full force at this moment. She forcefully entrapped him into becoming a father UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM AND AGAINST HIS WILL?! Who does that shit?! He is living at home?! He has zero inkling and drive to be a family man at this stage of his life, and he DOES NOT BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE. He tells my mom he’d rather die than live in a house with her and her other kids in “xyz town”. My mind is exploding with every revelation. Also with the sheer IDIOCY of my poor fool of a brother. Who stays with a woman the moment she jokes about going off birth control- she fucking scammed him. He starts sharing HORROR stories of her unhinged behavior - getting pissed/possessive when he goes camping/fishing with my dad. Giving him the silent treatment for a week after raging pissed when pulling up to pick him up for a date/hang out only to learn he has to help my dad with a car engine he needs loaded into the truck - which will take 1 hour, and is on FATHERS DAY WEEKEND (all of this in front of my dad). The amount of gaslighting and abuse is unlike anything I’ve ever heard before and I just cannot grasp how this relationship survived? Was it a mix of convenience with just the right amount of crazy to keep him coming back? Does she have something on him and is extorting him? Meanwhile, during all the flood gating, he is getting the haircut, trimming the beard, and pulling out the white she asked of him, he says I never told her no, just why I didn’t want to, she’s live-sending him insane messages and threatening to break up with him, with all the insults and threats under the sun. 
I listened but didn’t give my brother any advice (my mom did, along the lines of: she’s a psychopath), that is until we pulled out for a planned trip hours before said photo shoot, and I looked out the window and told him simply: don’t do the photo today, tell her to wait till she’s 8 months.
Well the next day we learned my brother didn’t take the photo and ended up escaping last minute to his old stomping grounds 7 hours away and is spending the next 2 weeks with friends and family down there. No one knows yet except for me, Mom and Dad. She “broke up with him” (for hundredth time?) She texts my mom (first ever text) a novel of more gaslighting and insults - my brother is a liar and a loser dead beat and she will raise the baby alone as she can’t have someone so selfish and irresponsible around her family (word of advice, when someone tells you who they are: BELIEVE THEM. She’s blaming my brother on not being ready or wanting to start a family with her while also completely BETRAYING HIS TRUST BY SCAMMING HIM INTO FORCEFULLY BECOMING A FATHER TO HER CHILD - and obviously ALL HER CHILDREN). She says my brother will need to do a court order. My mom hasn’t yet responded (but eventually wants to confront her - mind blowing as my mom is all happy flower love towards everyone, even all the crazies before her). We are now back home, minus brother who’s still on his hiatus, haven’t shared with anyone amidst the drama and uncertainty, minds still reeling. My parents are convinced there's a 50/50 he’ll go back to her. My dad just walked in while writing this, holding a grocery bag with some of my brother’s clothes and apparently she dropped it off IN OUR BACK YARD while we were home. Creepy.

My mom and dad say they break up every week and he doesn’t seem to care. She still doesn’t come around, has been to zero family events, dinners, hang outs. My mom LOVES everyone, but she doesn’t like this woman for my brother, but she can fake it 100%, has seen the woman pull up a handful of times and says hello, that my brother usually will sleep over there when they’re “good” but is usually home or at work, and virtually all of his belongings are here…anyway, when my brother is in love he loves loudly. But he’s as quiet as a fucking mouse. It’s just fucking weird. I can’t get a reading from anyone. First day into my trip home this summer my dad says my brother tells him he’s looking for a house to rent locally with her - and my parents are shocked. Two days into my trip he comes home from work and says he wants to show us something. My mom and I are like what?! I was thinking it was something for his dune buggy he’s fixing up, my mom thinks it’s a puppy. It’s a FUCKING SONOGRAM. I haven’t even met this woman and I know my brother IS BY NO MEANS MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY prepared/wants to start a family. BUT we’d all never say that. It was the most shocking unexpected thing I’ve ever heard in my life!  We all basically said holy shit! My mom hugged him! My dad asked if he was going to marry her (no! He says!). We were all shocked (not negative comments but not congrats either). He doesn’t know how many weeks she is. Two minutes later in walks the girlfriend. We get to know her. She is sweet, and friendly, trying to connect with my two girls and is sporting QUITE the baby bump. She’s 13 weeks - which is clear on the sonogram, but she looks 6 months. And she says my brother was waiting to tell us when I got home. She shares some things with me (how hard it is to connect with my brother, to get him to open up and be emotional, how he wasn’t happy at first hearing she was pregnant and it was an accident - birth control pills didn’t work). I got a weird feeling BUT I kept my mind open. This woman is my new sister in law and I will accept her and try to connect with her like all the others. She stays for dinner (first time!), she stays late and we chat. She talks crap about her ex-husband (weird) and how she has sole custody. She talks about how her eldest son is severely disabled and she earns her living on state income caring for her son, that he’s her angel. She leaves with me knowing that she’s a GREAT mom, and that my brother is going to go from independent bachelor to a father of 3. It’s a lot aka MIND FUCK! The next day I apologize to my brother for being so shocked and tell him congrats and hug him. Three days later shit hits the fan. My brother comes home and is pissed and freaked - he’s venting to my mom. Girlfriend has scheduled a professional photography shoot to announce their pregnancy on Instagram. It’s been in the books for weeks/months. It’s with her other two children and my brother. She told him to get a hair cut, shave, and wear all white. She is 13 weeks pregnant, they don’t live together, he’s never been involved in caring or interacting with her kids, and again she is THIRTEEN WEEKS PREGNANT. I know lots of people do pregnancy announcements and professional family photos, but I have NEVER seen a single friend do one on virtually the day after the first trimester. My red flag alarm bells go sounding off. I am only listening, my mom is talking him through it. He’s convinced it’s for the ex husband, he also is 100% anti-instagram anti-share every aspect of your life and despises the idea of “doing a cheesy family photo”.  He is on a roll now with the flood gates, showing the reality of their relationship, the text messages where she is berating him, insulting him, cussing him out, calling him a dead beat, the threats of destroying his life, making him regret he was ever born, the NARCISSITIC CONTROL AND GAS LIGHTING. Holy shit, the quantity and length of messages is NEXT LEVEL. Several novels were written in the span of their one-year on-and-off fling. She is clearly emotionally and verbally abusive. He is somehow clearly taking the abuse and submitting to her controlling demands and irrational explosions. My parents say it’s been this way the last year…whaaatt??! Then the real clinger here: my brother admits she’s been BEGGING HIM FOR A BABY FOR MONTHS. He was adamant about it, no! He doesn’t want marriage or to start a family. They’d break up. He’d go back. He says she’d “beg” him for a baby every day, THEN JOKE ABOUT “WELL WHAT IF I GET OFF BIRTH CONTROL haha”. Holy shit my gut instinct on the back patio in full force at this moment. She forcefully entrapped him into becoming a father UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM AND AGAINST HIS WILL?! Who does that shit?! He is living at home?! He has zero inkling and drive to be a family man at this stage of his life, and he DOES NOT BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE. He tells my mom he’d rather die than live in a house with her and her other kids in “xyz town”. My mind is exploding with every revelation. Also with the sheer IDIOCY of my poor fool of a brother. Who stays with a woman the moment she jokes about going off birth control- she fucking scammed him. He starts sharing HORROR stories of her unhinged behavior - getting pissed/possessive when he goes camping/fishing with my dad. Giving him the silent treatment for a week after raging pissed when pulling up to pick him up for a date/hang out only to learn he has to help my dad with a car engine he needs loaded into the truck - which will take 1 hour, and is on FATHERS DAY WEEKEND (all of this in front of my dad). The amount of gaslighting and abuse is unlike anything I’ve ever heard before and I just cannot grasp how this relationship survived? Was it a mix of convenience with just the right amount of crazy to keep him coming back? Does she have something on him and is extorting him? Meanwhile, during all the flood gating, he is getting the haircut, trimming the beard, and pulling out the white she asked of him, he says I never told her no, just why I didn’t want to, she’s live-sending him insane messages and threatening to break up with him, with all the insults and threats under the sun. 
I listened but didn’t give my brother any advice (my mom did, along the lines of: she’s a psychopath), that is until we pulled out for a planned trip hours before said photo shoot, and I looked out the window and told him simply: don’t do the photo today, tell her to wait till she’s 8 months.
Well the next day we learned my brother didn’t take the photo and ended up escaping last minute to his old stomping grounds 7 hours away and is spending the next 2 weeks with friends and family down there. No one knows yet except for me, Mom and Dad. She “broke up with him” (for hundredth time?) She texts my mom (first ever text) a novel of more gaslighting and insults - my brother is a liar and a loser dead beat and she will raise the baby alone as she can’t have someone so selfish and irresponsible around her family (word of advice, when someone tells you who they are: BELIEVE THEM. She’s blaming my brother on not being ready or wanting to start a family with her while also completely BETRAYING HIS TRUST BY SCAMMING HIM INTO FORCEFULLY BECOMING A FATHER TO HER CHILD - and obviously ALL HER CHILDREN). She says my brother will need to do a court order. My mom hasn’t yet responded (but eventually wants to confront her - mind blowing as my mom is all happy flower love towards everyone, even all the crazies before her). We are now back home, minus brother who’s still on his hiatus, haven’t shared with anyone amidst the drama and uncertainty, minds still reeling. My parents are convinced there's a 50/50 he’ll go back to her. My dad just walked in while writing this, holding a grocery bag with some of my brother’s clothes and apparently she dropped it off IN OUR BACK YARD while we were home. Creepy. 
So Reddit, AITA for wanting my brother to stay the hell away from this woman other than whatever unfortunate future custody agreement 🥴 and child support will come in to play down the road?  Is it wrong for me to attempt to get in the middle and tell him what I think he should do? ",,0.05814805626869202,0,0
149,1dzmhu2,AITA - Foster cat custody,"So in January of 2022 my babysitter (a minor)'s parent reached out on social media asking for a foster family for her (babysitters mom) mother(babysitters grandmother)'s cat.

I was very open to help out as my cat needed a buddy and I had the space & time to do a foster. There was no specific timeline given as to when they would take the cat back, except for a vague 6-10 month time span. I was given a large bag of cat food at the time, which helped the transition. 

It is now 20 months later. 

The ""original"" owner of the cat only had him for 2 years, since he was adopted from a shelter prior. I have only received $100 from these folks since I took him in. 

I have never asked for compensation before, but it was discussed that any medical bills would be talked about and likely compensated for while I had him in my care. I have receipts.
He has never needed medical care so I never thought to bring it up. However, the food I give this cat (which is the same I give my own cat) tend to lean on the mid-range side, I'm spending well over $100 per month in food costs + litter.

We are coming up on the 2 year mark soon of me fostering this adorable boy, which is about the same time the previous owner had him in their possession. I have heard nothing on their end in regards to making an effort of taking him back. 

My young children, fiance & other cat have bonded with this foster boy and I don't really want to give him up (his age is roughly 10 by now) because I would love for him to have a forever home. 

Would I be the a**hole for keeping him? I don't want to burn a bridge but it truly seems like they don't ""want"" the foster boy, but they WANT him back eventually.

Where do I draw the line of time/love/money/energy spent to make my case for keeping him?

I love his best friend and him their dynamic super cute.

My bf is different from Eve. He is a really fundemtnally good person. It's rare to find, but true. Even has always had her bad side, but I love her no matter what.

She slept with my ex-bf in HS for multiple years. She wanted to tell me but he kept saying I would never speak to them again, so she got scared and didn't. I was upset, but forgave her because I love her. She's like my sister, and I knew our friendship wouldn't die there.

I told my bf this story, but I left out that it was Eve. Later we were drinking with his bff and I confessed it was her. They were both shocked, and after that my bf was never the same around her.

I have access to his phone. So I went to his messages and typed in ""Eve"" to see what came up, what she was saying about him. I know I shouldn't have, but I was beyond curious and he has said before that he doesn't really mind me looking through his phone.

But the messages were just full of him shit talking her with his best friend. He was saying that, ""he feels bad for me, like Eve is the worst friend you can have"" and ""who would sleep with someone's bf for years"" and ""she gives me bad vibes.""

It was just full of him trash talking her. He also said, ""she thinks the problem was the toxic boy, but the problem also is her toxic friend, should have thrown them both out.""

I was fucking pissed? And horrified? And upset? 

I was crying and showed him the texts and said I can't believe he would say that about Eve. She's like my sister and he's shit talking her. I just went off on him and started crying and yelling and it was horrible.

I just don't get how he can blame her for things I forgave her for and how he can talk about her like that. Eve is amazing. AITA or did he cross a line with what he said about her?

151,1dzmdbz,AITA for overreacting to a prank?,"Apologies in advance if this is hard to follow. Throwaway

So, I (20F) was friends with a group of roommates until recently. Three of them (Nora - 20F, Zoe - 21F, and Cameron - 22?NB) had been roommates for two years before this year, while the fourth (Rebecca - 20F) joined this year. Nora, Rebecca, and I became friends through a sports team, and Rebecca and I met the others through Nora. The plan was that I would move in next year when Cameron graduated, but I don't want to live with Rebecca after Cameron and Rebecca decided to pull a prank on Nora, Zoe, and two others, also ""getting"" me with it in the process.

The prank was first disappearing for several hours after pretending to get a call from the police station. When asked what had happened, they refused to answer. I wasn't present for this, but Nora and I were together while they enacted the rest of the prank, so I learned everything Nora was being told (via Zoe, who was being told by Cameron/Rebecca).

When they returned from the ""police station"", they told Zoe that they had found a dead body the previous night. Zoe called Nora to tell her this, so we cut our trip short to come back. Multiple hours later, Nora texted me, having just found out that it was a prank. Due to the state of mind this put me in, my memory of the exact order things happened after this is not the best.

Since it's relevant, I have depression and anxiety disorders which they were aware of, and I am autistic, which I had kept private. Additionally, I have had previous bad experiences with this sort of thing, one where someone took my (at the time only) friend's phone and pretended like we had to stop being friends, and one at a camp, where camp leaders staged a person falling off a wooden structure and being stabbed through the chest with a wood stake. So, when I found out it was a prank, I started having an anxiety/panic attack, needing to take an emergency anxiety med.

Around an hour later, Cameron messaged me, explaining that it was a prank/apologizing. In the morning, I spent 20+ minutes trying to get details from Cameron, who was (imo) deliberately misunderstanding clear questions I was asking. Then, Cameron stopped answering, and Rebecca started messaging me. The same process happened, as well as one instance where Rebecca contradicted what Cameron had said. Rebecca did eventually apologize, after I asked her to, but when I said I wanted her to work out a plan to rebuild trust with me, she said she didn't think that was needed.

I feel I cannot trust Rebecca anymore, and she isn't genuinely sorry (at least to me), or interested in trying to rebuild trust with me. Both her and Nora have said I shouldn't be as upset as I am, and Nora has specifically said that I am overreacting (I asked her if she thought I was, because that was the feeling I was getting from her messages to me).

The group (including me) does have a history of doing pranks, but they've never been anything like this.

The problem is, there is always a moment where my mom gets a message on her phone and she puts on her reading glasses and checks her phone. When she does this I always pause the show so she doesn't miss anything.

It really annoys me when people start checking their phone or doing other things while watching movies or shows, but I just look at her and wait until she's done. She always tells me to just keep watching, and gets mad at me for pausing and says that it's disrespectful to my dad who has to wait. I tell her that I wouldn't have to pause the show if she didn't keep checking her phone.

Today we had a big argument about this situation. She doesn't understand why it bothers me so much and thinks that I'm being controlling and that I want her to just obey me. She doesn't care about missing stuff because she thinks she can get up to speed, she says that it doesn't take her long to just check the message that she got, and that it could be something important, like an emergency.

I told her that we're watching the show together so I feel like she's being disrespectful, and also that I don't want her to miss anything important, and that I would understand if it was an emergency, but every single time it's been nothing urgent, and she still answers (and I told her that she doesn't even text fast, that she taps every letter with one finger). She said that I need to let her be, and I said that she can check her messages and answer them and do whatever she wants, but I will always pause the show even if she's annoyed.

She then said that if I don't get used to her doing that and stop caring so much we won't be able to keep watching the show together. I said I wouldn't change my mind.

Another thing is that my mom's dad was very controlling when she was younger, and she brought up how whenever they sat down to watch tv he would shush anyone who talked, and that he didn't even let anyone get up or move or make any noise while watching. She said that she refuses to live through that again and that I act the same as him. I do understand where she's coming from, and I can acknowledge that I'm controlling and that it annoys me an abnormal amount when people aren't paying attention to the tv, but my way of compromising is pausing the show, but she doesn't want that.

160,1dzlim1,AITA for overreacting over what my brother (family) is doing?,"My brother and I (female) live together at our mother’s house (she is pregnant). We do not live in the USA. 
I will not share our ages but my brother is an adult (American legal age, not a teenager), and I am about two years younger than him. 
My relationship with my mother is pretty amazing, although we have our differences, and our past wasn’t good because she was a addict and not always the best mother. My relationship with my brother is also generally good; we talk openly about sibling things. However, he always acts like he’s right and doesn’t really respect me when it comes to chores or anything I try to talk to him about that angers me.

My mother splits her time between this apartment and another one she owns with her ex-boyfriend, so she is mostly not here. The apartment we live in has three bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and one bathroom. The living room is unused because my brother has his setup in his bedroom, and I only stay in mine. The other apartment has one bedroom, a living room, a kitchen, and one bathroom, so I can't stay there.

For those interested in understanding the school and work system in my country, here's an explanation: 
You attend school from 1st to 9th grade. You can pursue long-term education (gymnasium long-term) for six years to study law or any other field, but you need to take a test in 6th and 7th grade. If you are in 8th grade, you can do the short-term gymnasium. If you decide to study law or a similar field after 9th grade, you can do something similar called BMS (Berufs Matura). You need to complete a degree like retail, which takes 3-4 years of school and work. After passing the final test, you get your retail degree and can work in related fields. There are other degrees like electrician, etc. You don't have to pursue any further education after school if you don't want to.

To give you an idea of what my brother and I do:

My brother works 2-3 times a week (retail but not a retail degree) and attends game design school 1-2 times a week. He attended the gymnasium for five and a half years but quit because he realized it wasn’t for him. He started doing what I explained above. He went to boarding school for the gymnasium, meaning he was away for five years and only came home on weekends, so I mostly lived like an only child and did everything on my own.

I started doing an electrical planner degree after school, which takes four years to complete. After two years, I realized it wasn’t for me, so I quit. Two months later, I decided I wanted to do the short-term gymnasium and go on to study law or medicine, which starts in August. Since I have a lot of free time now, I help my mother start her new clothing shop and run things at her main job.

Here’s what I do for her: I design the new logo, choose colors and measurements, organize the logo, select clothes to sell, and plan the setup. I do get help, but I handle all the organization and handwork. For her other job, I help with PowerPoint presentations, correct English, and design the new website. I also help her pick outfits and choose makeup and hairstyles 3-4 times a week. If she doesn’t like it at the end of the day, it’s my fault because she didn’t feel comfortable.

The problem now:
I feel like my brother thinks he doesn’t have to do anything anymore because he goes to school, works, and pays half of the rent (which is 800 to 1000, so he pays 400/500). I don’t work and ""only"" help our mother, which he underestimates. Working for your own mother can be stressful because if something goes wrong, it’s my fault. A year ago, I went to school and worked to get a degree and still did my share of the chores.

In the last two weeks, I haven’t fully done my chores at home. Of course, I cleaned up after myself, putting things back in the drawer, etc. My room is a bit messy, but as we say at home, ""my room, my problem,"" unlike the kitchen and bathroom, which are shared spaces. I wasn’t home for three days because I was at my dad’s house. I thought he might have done the dishwasher and cleaned the kitchen counters, but of course, he didn’t (there were only a couple of my dishes because he didn’t unload the dishwasher again).

After I came back, I didn’t do anything for a week or two. I also didn’t eat there or leave a lot of dishes, just a couple. On the other hand, he left food out, letting it get moldy. He recently came into my room and asked why I wasn’t cleaning and if I was doing anything at all. Of course, I told him I do a lot but also take breaks.

I asked him if he did anything in the kitchen. He said ""yes"" and listed four small tasks, including cleaning one pan. He then said, ""Just unload the dishwasher and I will load it,"" which doesn’t make sense because whenever I unload it and tell him to do his part, he always says, ""No, I did that two weeks ago,"" and sometimes even claims credit for what I did.

Today, I cleaned the kitchen because I was hungry and wanted to cook. I hate cooking in a dirty space. I’ve tried talking to him many times, but he always claims he did the dishwasher two or three weeks ago and lists minor tasks he does around the apartment, which doesn’t explain why there’s still dirt all over the kitchen counters. He doesn’t want to hear it and always acts like he’s right and I’m wrong. When I talk to our mother, she either says nothing to him or takes his side.

Another issue is that we didn’t have food, and I couldn’t buy groceries because I was at my father’s place. When I came back, I mostly ordered food with the remaining money I had because I didn’t have time to buy groceries. He didn’t buy food either, except snacks and Pepsi for himself. If we need food, we can ask our mother for money, and he knows that but always tells me to go ask her and then buy the food. He could do it occasionally too; he goes to the store for his stuff anyway and maybe buys 1L of milk, which isn’t very useful.

Today, I saw we had 500g of pasta, which is maybe one or two portions, and asked him if I could make it, thinking he bought it with his money. He asked if I could make something else, but we had nothing else. So, I cooked it. We didn’t have cheese, but I found mozzarella in the fridge and asked if I could use a slice. He said that’s not why he bought it. It turns out he bought meat pizzas for himself (I’m allergic to meat). He said there weren’t vegetarian pizzas, but he could have bought something else for me. After I finished cooking, I took a serving and left some for later, thinking I could have the whole thing since he had pizzas. But he ate the other half. Now I have to shop for groceries tomorrow because he knows if I don’t have food, I will buy it for both of us.

I’m fed up with this behavior and don’t know how much longer I can stand it. He’s a grown man. When I started my degree, I only got 650 a month. He makes 2,000 to 3,000 because he works hourly shifts since he didn’t get a degree. Now, I don’t get any money because I don’t work anymore. I have school from Monday to Friday and time to study on weekends.

I thought of getting an hourly job to earn my own money. I wanted to get my own apartment when I turn the legal age to live alone. But now that I’ve changed my career path, I’ll probably stay with my mother and brother. When I have time to get a job, I will aim to get my own apartment with my cousin.

Thanks for reading all that. Any help for how to handle people like my mother and brother?

After I finished cooking, I took a serving and left some for later, thinking I could have the whole thing since he had pizzas. But he ate the other half. Now I have to shop for groceries tomorrow because he knows if I don’t have food, I will buy it for both of us.

I’m fed up with this behavior and don’t know how much longer I can stand it. He’s a grown man. When I started my degree, I only got 650 a month. He makes 2,000 to 3,000 because he works hourly shifts since he didn’t get a degree. Now, I don’t get any money because I don’t work anymore. I have school from Monday to Friday and time to study on weekends.

I thought of getting an hourly job to earn my own money. I wanted to get my own apartment when I turn the legal age to live alone. But now that I’ve changed my career path, I’ll probably stay with my mother and brother. When I have time to get a job, I will aim to get my own apartment with my cousin.

Thanks for reading all that. Any help for how to handle people like my mother and brother?

161,1dzlhu7,WIBTA if I asked my family to stop throwing me parties?,"For context, I(17) have had problems with my past two birthday parties. 

When I turned 16 I was asked what I wanted as a party, when I said I wanted a Minecraft themed birthday with a few friends my mom(37) and grandma(63) instantly told me no. Instead my grandma insisted I have a sweet 16. I never wanted one, because at the time my mom didn’t have a job and we aren’t wealthy. Another thing was that they kept pushing for me to be feminine and wear a dress which I am vehemently against as I hate being feminine.

I relented and said they could throw the party after weeks of being pestered. I let them do basically whatever they wanted for the party, I had only asked for a few things; I would not under any circumstances wear a dress, it would be a costume party and the colors I picked out were final. While they tried to fight me on the dress and the costume thing so it could be “traditional” they stopped.

The party was a bust. They didn’t finish setting up the party till over an hour after the time it was supposed to begin. Half of my friends I invited didn’t show up and almost everyone else there was my grandma’s older friends. My mom made fun of me in front of everyone in her speech. They kept arguing and telling me about their dislike for what the other was doing during the planning.

My 17th birthday was no better I had only asked for food from my favorite restaurant and that I would eat at my grandma’s house. Around the beginning of my birthday month my mom told me that we would be getting evicted, in less than two weeks before my birthday.

My grandma called a little before my birthday saying that she and her friends wanted to go to a restaurant they had been looking at for my birthday. I kept telling her no but she wasn’t listening. She tried to guilttrip me by saying she was getting older and using some family drama I won’t elaborate on against me. She did this over the phone with me when I was at my dad’s house. I had to call my mom to tell her to get my grandma to stop.

On my actual birthday I had had a horrible day at school. My grandma told me she bought me some expensive jewelry as a gift. I am not a jewelry person, she knows this and showed me that she was wearing the present she bought me. While I don’t mind that I didn’t receive the present, I’m happy I wasn’t given them because I wouldn’t have used them, I’m upset because she was rude towards me by showing me she was wearing what was supposed to be my present.

My last two birthdays have been annoying ordeals and I dont want it happening again. The emotional strain has not been worth it and neither has any of the money spent felt worth it either. Since my next birthday I will turn 18 they also want it to be big and special. They love doing things like this for me.

162,1dzl775,AITA for not paying the agreed upon amount?,"Me and my friends decided to take our dogs swimming. I found a dog swimming pool. Their site said the price per dog is 1000. I called them to book a slot and the man asked me how many dogs will there be and I said 5. He said that will be 5000 and I said okay. He asked me to pay 50% (2500) in advance, which I did.

One of my friend was unable to come with her dog due to a last minute emergency so only 4 dogs came. We paid 1500 more to the woman present there (the man's wife, they both own the place) and she said that we had said we would pay 5000 and we said that but one dog didn't come and she said that its fine, just pay 4000.

Just a few minutes later her husband (the man I had talked with on the phone) is calling me saying that we need to pay 1000 more because the deal was for 5000. I explained that 1 dog didn't come and that his wife, the co-owner, had no issues with the payment. He started being passive aggressive and guilt tripping about how we have taught him a valuable lesson and that from now on he will make people pay the full payment in advance. He said that we look bad scamming for just 1000.

I don't see why we should pay for a dog didn't come. It's not like the business provides a service that was wasted. The swimming pool remains the same regardless of whether there is 1 dog there or 10 dogs there. 

But the way he was talking made me feel bad and start wondering whether I am in the wrong. So I am here to ask, AITA?

163,1dzl3k5,WIBTA if I report unpermitted work on our house by my ex?,"My ex and I bought a house together. Not my idea. We're both on the mortgage and deed. There was talk of marriage and IVF. And then there wasn't. We moved in and a few months later broke up (relationship lasted several years) and they started dating someone new within weeks while we were still both living in the house and trying to figure out how to navigate things. So I moved out for my own mental health as quickly as I could after that. There was narcissistic behavior dating back quite a while, and hidden credit card debt. I'm much healthier and happier away from them. We're mostly NC now except for the mortgage.

Several months go by, during which they repeatedly tell me they can't afford to refinance or buy me out of my 50% share of the house just yet, but that when they inherit from their parents then all their problems will be solved. I detest this strategy. I even offered to walk away with nothing, no money, just a buy-out on paper and a quit claim deed, if they could just get it legally arranged quickly, but that didn't happen and there are no signs that it's happening any time soon.

I recently found out that they have spent $12k - $18k on work at the house, all on outdoor stuff and paving, including a pergola that exceeds the limit for unpermitted structures, and is closer to the lot line than it's supposed to be. I didn't know the work was being done. The HOA did actually issue a permission letter that I never got a copy of.

WIBTA if I bring the plans and photos of the work to the local permitting department and tell them I'm a co-owner who didn't want this work done and ask them what their/my options are? If I do, and they enforce the permit requirement, then technically, all of the owners (both of us are named on the deed) would have to sign the application paperwork (I asked them about this already). I'm not sure I want to sign that form. If I refuse, it might mean that there is no way to get it permitted retroactively, and the very large pergola might have to be completely removed, even if the rest of the work stays. Or I could just cooperate and sign whatever I need to, in the interests of fixing the issue properly.

Either way, I don't know that going to the permitting department benefits me in any way, it might even be a bad thing for me, since I'm pretty sure I'm now the co-owner of a house with unpermitted work, but I don't want this issue to raise its head in the future if/when we're trying to sell the house (I might have to sue for partition) or if/when the land next door gets developed and they see how close and how big the pergola is. This might be a year or more from now, but for context, my ex did something similar at a previous house they owned, also with an unpermitted pergola too close to the lot line, and it cropped up during the sale of that property after their divorce, jeopardizing the sale, though it was eventually sorted out.

164,1dzks99,AITA for going to a Cousin's wedding a day after my wife's grandmother's funeral?,"I am in the US, my cousin is in Canada and had a wedding which I was  asked to walk her down the aisle. Unfortunately a week before the wedding my wife's grandmother (89yrs) who's health had declined drastically earlier in the year passed.

The funeral was set for the same day ( June 19th) I was to travel to Canada for the wedding ( wedding on June 21st). With this I decided to to move my travel date to 20th and return right back on 21st after the wedding to be with my wife.

However, she feels I abandoned her and chose my cousin over her and wouldnt have a conversation with since and is asking for me to move out ( which am not doing offcourse). In fairness our marriage has been rocky in the last year and we've been going through counselling to improve our communication, so definately contributing to this but she thinks this is so unthinkable/unforgiveable that I left.

I do however, feel like I made the following comprises to be there for her:

1. The whole week before the funeral I sat with her each night to listen to her , confort her and just be present. I requested to work remote that week so I am home.
2. I moved my travel date so I can attend the funeral and leave the next day. I changed my travel from 4 days to 2 days ( I was litterally in Canada for less than 24hrs).
3. Also, my wife's concern  was been home by herself when she returned from the funeral ( We have two little kids 7yrs/5yrs).  With this I said she could stay with extended family who all live on the same street in her hometown where the funeral was happening. And once I came back I will take uber  ( 1hr 45 minute ride) come to her so we can drive together back home.

she has started exhibiting some dangerous traits lately which is beginning to worry me. over the past few months, she was asking strange questions about drugs. i was concerned but thought she may be curious about their effects. she confided in me about two months ago that she took marijuana with an older man that she barely knew, and lied about her age to. and sadly, it's all escalated from there. often, she is seeing a new older man (in their twenties) and lying about being older, getting gifts, money, and often drugs from them.


there's been two notable incidents of her crossing the line, in my opinion. the first was sneaking out at midnight. i know i can't stop her so i told her to stay in well lit public areas and not take any substances. she didn't answer me the whole time she was out. when she got home, she told me that she met an older man who asked her to go back to a hotel with him, and when she refused, he took her to a dark canal around 1km away from any other society, where they did cocaine together and kissed. i was genuinely in disbelief that she would do something like this, ignoring all of my advice to stay safe.


the second incident was around three weeks ago. she sent a text saying she was meeting another older man for a date and photo of her alone in a parking lot, which i opened around an hour after she sent it. i texted back as soon as i saw it, to ask how it was going. in response, she sent a video of her in a car with vodka bottles on the seat. i asked her if she was safe, out of instinct. she answered 'probably not'. my anxiety kicked in and i texted her, no answer. it felt like she was being kidnapped and there was nothing i could do to stop it. 


over the past two weeks, i've been texting her a lot less, while her behaviours continued. i was advised by my boyfriend not to text and just to space away for a while. i reached out to ask how things were going and she was annoyed with me for leaving her on delivered or read for long periods of time, where i proposed that we should have a conversation about how she makes me feel. i told her that she is legally putting herself and the men in danger, and that her substance abuse needs to stop. her response was that she appreciates my concerns but she knows what she's doing.


i don't know how to not feel drained by her. i'm feeling like it was a mistake to even bring up how i felt about what she's doing, since then the feelings wouldn't be on the surface and i'd be able to help her as much as i used to. so, aita for telling my friend how i dislike her behaviours and becoming withdrawn when i realised nothing will change no matter what i do? all opinions and judgements welcome please, i have no idea what to do.

168,1dzk5cv,AITA my family went on a cruise without me?,"
My sister called about two weeks ago and said on the phone she had something she was excited about coming up but she “couldn’t tell me”. Im not the type to pry so I moved on without much question. 

A day or two later I check her sc story and she is on a cruise and I didn’t think much of it. On a call with my mother shortly after she informed me she was on the cruise with my dad, uncle, and three of my cousins. 

For context, my parents are divorced, everyone on the cruise lives in GA and I live in FL where I am in college. 

A few days later my sister calls me after docking on the virgin islands where she got service and the first thing she says is that my dad wont tell her what he knows about me being gay (I came out to my dad recently, but my sister has known for years). 

After a bit of small talk I ask her why I wasnt invited on the cruise and she essentially says she didnt think I could afford it. I told her it wasnt her place to assume my financial situation and that it would have at least been polite to invite me. I later learned she told everyone including my close friends and told them not to inform me. She said the cruise was $3000 a person. 

I also asked her why they decided to go on a 9 day cruise without me when we have been talking about going on a deep sea fishing trip for years now. (Since i moved to florida especially its very reasonable as i live on the coast and there are charters walking distance from my home for $300 with all equipment provided) This was a trip i had invited the whole family on, and something i had been wanting to do to ideally work on repairing mine and my fathers already damaged relationship. 

She told me they would still come on the fishing trip to which i responded i no longer wanted to go on with them, and that if i went they were no longer invited. She then said she still wanted to come visit me in florida and i said that if she came to florida to find a hotel because she was not welcome at my place. 

They all got back a few days ago and she hasnt called me but has reached out to my mom to ask if i was still mad at her and my dad. 

Its frustrating to me because in the past i have always been the person to come up and visit for the holidays, and when i have come up to visit around christmas she spends more time at her boyfriends place or her friends houses than prioritizing spending time with me. Sometimes i would go and the only time i would see her was when she would pick me up at the airport. And the time we would spend together she doesnt plan any activity or have any meaningful conversation with me. 

Im done going out of my way to visit them. Im also not welcoming them into my home on the off chance they decide to come visit me either. Ive been living out of state for 4 years now and living in florida for 1 and havent had them visit me once but ive been there for every major holiday. 

Am i the asshole for being upset? Not wanting them to visit? Or no longer visit them?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"AITA my family went on a cruise without me? 
My sister called about two weeks ago and said on the phone she had something she was excited about coming up but she “couldn’t tell me”. Im not the type to pry so I moved on without much question. 

A day or two later I check her sc story and she is on a cruise and I didn’t think much of it. On a call with my mother shortly after she informed me she was on the cruise with my dad, uncle, and three of my cousins. 

For context, my parents are divorced, everyone on the cruise lives in GA and I live in FL where I am in college. 

A few days later my sister calls me after docking on the virgin islands where she got service and the first thing she says is that my dad wont tell her what he knows about me being gay (I came out to my dad recently, but my sister has known for years). 

After a bit of small talk I ask her why I wasnt invited on the cruise and she essentially says she didnt think I could afford it. I told her it wasnt her place to assume my financial situation and that it would have at least been polite to invite me. I later learned she told everyone including my close friends and told them not to inform me. She said the cruise was $3000 a person.

169,1dzk4n8,WIBTA if i kicked my disabled mother out and took custody of my little sister?,"I (22 NB) am debating kicking out my (42 F) mother and taking custody if my (10 F) sister.

Due to unfortunate circumstances, my mother and little sister have come to live with me in my studio apartment. They were only supposed to be here for 3 months bc I was due to move in with my boyfriend (26 M), but now it's been 6 because our new apartment's finish date keeps getting pushed back, and we're expecting 2 more months.

My mother has Sciatica, ADHD, OCD, and PTSD. This makes it hard for her to find a stable job, and thus a stable living situation. She does not pay bills, and half the time doesn't even provide food because her EBT was issued in another state. So im paying for all three of us off of my $1300/m pay. 

For the first month she didn't provide my sister with any toys besides her phone, which she would spend 14 hrs a day on. So i had to ask my friends for help. I established screen time rules, that i get no support on from my mother. She doesn't care to watch my sister, and has told me she ""doesn't want to have to check on her every 2 hours.""

She took my sister for 5 days out to her old state to run errands. They slept in her car with no ac. One of the nights they witnessed a robbery and, with my sister in the car, stuck around to give a statement. They only showered twice at a salvation army, during a heat wave. After begging for multiple days for her to let me pick my sister up and bring her back, she let me do it if I paid for her to get her phone fixed, and my sister came back sunburned. 

My sister is at the beginning of an alt-right pipeline and my mom refuses to acknowledge it. My sister glorifies white countries and demonizes asian countries. She has said racial stereotypes to my black boyfriend.

My mom thinks that white people are the victim because they are the majority in poverty, and she said this to my boyfriend.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-10,"WIBTA if i kicked my disabled mother out and took custody of my little sister?

170,1dzk3x1,AITA for refusing to move in with my aunt,"I'm 20F, I'm in college and my campus is near-ish to where my aunt lives. She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl three months ago, and her husband travels for work a lot, so ever since my classes ended for last semester I've been staying with her to help her out, mostly with her older kids (5 and 6). I plan to stay here until classes start again, and then move back into campus. 

My aunt is a bit freaked about me leaving, and has been asking me to move in with her while I'm in school too. I've tried to explain that even if I stayed with her, I wouldn't be able to help out much since my classes would take up most of my time and I also work on campus during the semester. Besides that, while it's not un-doable, she doesn't exactly live next to campus, and the daily commute to and from it would mess up my schedule greatly. 

She's decided to take matters to my mom, and her and my other aunts are acting like I'm the most selfish person in the world for not wanting to move in with my aunt. I don't really think I am, I would straight up have to drop out to actually be helpful during classes, but having no one in my life right now see my side of things is making me doubt myself.
