0,1dzjdmt,AITA for charging family member rent? ,"So in January I let my wives cousin move into the home.  She told a story of emotional and verbal abuse from her mother and talked of deep dark thoughts while living with her.  She is 25, never held a real job.   I said yes because I'm a good person and believe family should help family. When we agreed to it we told said cousin she'd have to get a full time job, learn to drive, and contribute to the household by way of doing simple things like cleaning up a little and come summer a small amount of rent. She agreed

Shortly after we find out she never finished high school and it was causing issues looking for work. Ok no problem, worked with her and she finished her GED in April.  She then acquired a job that pays $9/hr 10-20 hours a month.   

We told her work that until she finds something else so she has some work experience.  During this time she's preparing to get her license.   That happens in a week.   We talked with her last month about the search for full time work.  My wife sent her job postings and she doesn't apply.   She's above retail, food service, gas stations, ect.   Dad is paying her bills and mom is trying to buy her love back during this time

We talked with her in the start of June again about finding a full-time job.  She kinda shrugged it off. At the same time we told her come August we would be charging $400 a month for rent.  She gets full access to the house, we pay for everything, including her food and personal products. She uses far more toilet paper and hot water than the average person we know.  She kind of shrugged it off again. 

This weekend we were told we were the AHs because we're going to be charging her rent. Honestly if she were to show some effort we probably would push the due date by a month or two to let her save some money but there is zero want to work it seems. 

Her mother who has basically said we're strangers she lives with and nothing more said we should just be happy she's working at all. Her dad is burned out from many years of drugs and drinking (he drank and hit drugs heavily in the 70s/80s) and doesn't want anything to do with it except for the unknown amount of money he gives her monthly that is supposed to go towards her maxed out credit cards.   We were gone for a few days and 4x a day there was a door dash delivery at the house despite having left her with a full fridge, freezer and pantry. 

AITA for standing firm with the demand for rent and telling her she can sign a lease agreement or she can find other housing arrangements? I feel like we're being taken advantage of at this point. Despite providing her with everything she doesn't clean, unload dishwasher, or even clean her massive piles of hair from the shower drain.  She just expects us to do it.

1,1dzjcoc,AITA family drama teens,"Two of my children (14&16) spent the weekend at my MILs with their 2 cousins (17&18) I happened to go there to their house with my other child (7) the next day. When I was leaving, my MIL tells me she’s going to send me a text there’s something I should be aware of. 

I got in the car and read the message: it is basically saying the 17 year old cousin started crying to “Nan” because of a video she saw on my sons phone, and she stated it has my 14 year old daughter making a derogatory remark about the 17 year olds body. And that I need to address this, this has to stop and that video needs to be deleted. 

I questioned my kids together and saw the video. Conclusion from the video: Neither of my children were there( i know this for a fact), it was a video my son recieved through text from a friend, and there’s NOTHING said about the 17year olds body in it at all by anyone. 

I texted back to my MIL and tell her that. My kids were both with me that day, they weren’t there and sent her the video so she could see for herself there was nothing negative said about the 17year old at all. 

After sending this, my MIL says she’s going to confront the 17 year old to get to the bottom of this, and now she claims she never believed what she was told anyways. However, she would like to wait until the 17year old is alone (first crying conversation was had in front of the 18year old cousin and Nan told them both she was going to look into it.) But my daughter is very upset that her Nan would think/believe she would act like that. 

Fast forward a few days and it comes up again in text form and Nan now says she’s decided not to confront the 17year old. She just doesn’t want to get in the middle of it anymore. 

I’m so upset over this. My take: MIL was so quick to accuse 14 year of trash talking her cousin, but when the facts are shown, MIL decides to bow out of situation and let the 17year old basically trash talk my daughter to the rest of our family.

2,1dzj7xk,AITA for reporting my neighbor for laundry room shenanigans?,"So, earlier today I (40ish, NB) decided to do laundry. It's in the basement of the sub-building, and it's only 1 washer and 1 dryer. I've lived here for years and have gotten used to putting 2 or 3 loads through in one run so that they just get done and I'm not down there every other day for this. It's never been a problem.

A few months ago, the whole sub-building (one of MANY in this complex) got printed letters from property management about ""leaving your laundry in the machines all day"" or something. I didn't think anything of it at the time bc I don't do that.

Every now & then the machine has an error bc the front-loading washer door won't lock properly, therefore it won't start (bc it would leak). I didn't notice, went up, came back down 30 mins later to push the next load in, saw the error on the machine. I got it going, reset my timer, went back up. Came back down 30 mins later to find my stuff pulled out & flopped wet on top of the folding counter, a pink basket in front of the washer, & my other load/basket shoved aside.

Rude.

It's mid-day on a Tuesday, so I thought I was out of the way. I put my stuff into the dryer & went back up. I was confused & a little unsettled that someone just entitled themselves to doing that. I wrote a polite (no really, it was polite) note explaining that I would happily have let them get their load through real quick in between mine, if they had simply asked. I also noted that I'm not mad, but that I really don't appreciate my stuff being touched/moved & I'd never do that to someone else, & that I would've warned them about the washer door & shown them the work-around if they had just asked.  
  
It did the same thing to her, and I wondered if she's aggro enough to just throw my stuff around, she's probably aggro enough to blame me for the machine acting up or just be all nasty in my face if she saw me.  
  
I'm moderately disabled, w/ severe PTSD, & not confident I could defend myself in a throwdown. So I sat texting my leasing agent to ask her how she'd handle it. We're friends w the maintenance team, so I asked if a guy could like, hang out so I could get my stuff w/o incident. He stopped by, & I did so.

She came back down, I heard her cursing/slamming the machine, then walking away w/ my note. I peeped which apt she went back to, texted the LA back, & she said she'd address it. I'll just do the rest of mine later this week or w/e.

I'm pretty sure, per the timing when she would have moved in, that she's the reason we all got that letter. And that's not the only letter we've all gotten (noise, dogs, parking, mail, etc.) Like, do people not know that more than 1 load of laundry is like, very normal? Did she think I was lazy & left my stuff?

I can't tell if I'm the AH for like, wanting to do 2 loads consecutively, mid-day like this? Or for leaving a quick note to clarify? AITA for making the LA aware? I really really hate snitches. But even my dad was like, ""yeah she sounds like a Karen"".

I am now getting grief every time. I've used different sprays. I've used ozium. I have done everything I can. Yet she still complains about it constantly.

The kicker is I'm moving out permanently before the end of the month. Two and a half weeks, last Sunday of July.

I have been having some issues with my bank and therefore was unable to access my account, which I let her know when she invited me out. I told her I'd pay her back as soon as possible, and she agreed that was fine. While we were at dinner, she mentioned that one of our other close friends (22F) had yet to pay her back a substantial amount after a weekend the two of them had spent in Chicago. I promised I would be more prompt.

A week or so later, she texted to remind me. I assured her that it was still on my mind, and that I would pay her the moment my issues were fixed with my checking account. I suggested she request the amount I owed on Venmo, so that it would be certain I wouldn't forget. She agreed, and that was the last we spoke about it.

A couple days after that, my issues were fixed and I was finally able to access my account. I went to my Venmo requests and saw that the amount she had asked for was about ten dollars higher than the total of my meal. I texted her about this, asking politely if there was something I was forgetting, assuring her that I would pay the full amount she'd requested if that was how much I actually owed. She never responded to this (and even left me on read) so I honestly forgot about it after sending the text.

This morning, news made it back to me that she has been mentioning to some of our other friends that she's annoyed at me for not paying her back, especially after she told me about how frustrated she was with our other friend for forgetting about payment too. I was pretty confused by this, as she never responded to me when I asked her to clarify the payment amount.

6,1dziwgt,WIBTA for sending my autistic cousin to day camp?,"Let’s call my dad Dad and my cousin Cousin. PLEASE don’t judge my dad, he is doing his absolute best  

I (21F) and my dad (45M) have been taking care of my cousin (17F) for the past two years while her bio parents sort out some mental health and other things. Dad is a trucker so he can be gone for up to a few days at a time. I have my own issues with some trauma I’m working through (family on my mom's side is kind of wild) but Cousin aged out of foster and we live many hours drive away from mom's side and dad's side is on another continent (Dad is an immigrant) so our only choice was to take Cousin in. I love Cousin to death and have been taking care of her since we were kids because at one point we lived together in kinship care, it’s a long complicated situation but basically we're technically cousins but more like half siblings. 

Anyway, so Dad is the primary income. I have a summer job but it’s part time (20 hours weekly) and minimum wage. In the meantime I do the cooking, cleaning, etc. We basically live like a 50s nuclear household but without all the nasty fifties treatment I can’t name here. So like, I do cooking, cleaning, entertaining guests (mostly Cousin's friends), and Dad does yard work, budget, income, driving, etc.. We had a good setup for awhile because by pure coincidence Dad was always home whenever I was at work last year and so Cousin wasn’t alone. This year isn’t the case. I started college, I’m still working, and it’s really adding up. I gained 2 inches on my stomach in less than a month. My hair is falling out. I am extremely stressed. 

Cousin is autistic. She doesn’t know how to cook or clean even though I’ve showed her a billion times. I feel bad asking her to clean because when I lived with my mom (age 5-14) I was basically the maid. I don’t want Cousin to have this experience like I did. So I set up activities for her, cook her food, clean her dishes, et cetera. I tried to think, ""okay it’s not her fault, just be as kind and loving as you can possibly be"" but then people accuse me of coddling her, treating her like a baby, and hindering her potential. 

There is a day camp in my area age 14-18. Cousin hates loud noises and wears noise canceling headphones. She hates being in wet clothes. She can’t deal with the sun unless she’s wearing one very specific outfit. She doesn’t eat many things. She has a special diet of things she'll eat. I have to remind her bathroom, water, etc.. Day camp would be absolute HELL for her. At the same time, Dad does not have the time to be caring for her at the same level as I do. I am absolutely stressed and I need some time where I can take care of ME and not someone else. There are literally no options other than 1 week day camp 9am-4pm to give me a little vacation. It would be t0rture for her, it’s everything she hates, but I NEED my me time so bad. It’s between that and me literally walking away for a week — which is neglect as she can’t care for herself.

7,1dziiad,AITA for refusing to go camping for more than 4 days?  ,"I’ve never been camping, I’m severely allergic to mosquitos, have stomach problems and I just generally like being within the comfort of my house.

Both our birthdays are coming up next week and since we’re long distance, we planned to meet in his city, I asked what he wants to do for his birthday and he said camping so we’re going camping.

I will be there from Wednesday to Sunday. I asked if we could maybe spend Saturday night at a hotel so I can shower and have a good nights sleep before my flight on Sunday as my flight will be arriving back to my city at 12 am Sunday night (Monday morning) and I have to be at work at 8 am so considering the hour drive from the airport to my place + showering + getting ready for bed. I won’t be going to sleep until 3 am. I’m also assuming that after a week of sleeping in a tent I’d be exhausted af so I just want to sleep a little before my flight and shower and freshen up but he said that it would be pointless to spend a night at a hotel. I said in that case I’m going to leave Saturday night so I have all day on Sunday to unwind after our week long camping trip, that hit a nerve and he said the whole trip would be pointless, I explained my point of view and he said what’s the point of taking time off work on Wednesday Thursday and Friday if we’re not gonna even use Sunday which is already a weekend. I told him I don’t want to arrive at 12 am and end up in bed at 3 because I’ll be exhausted all day on Monday, he wouldn’t compromise. I went ahead and booked my flight back Saturday night anyway. Now he’s acting off, doesn’t seem excited to see me, giving me attitude and just overall acting like I ruined our trip. It is also my birthday and I would’ve rather done something other than camping but I’m doing it since that’s what he wants for his birthday and I still feel like I’m not doing enough because I’m not ok with coming home too late on Sunday and spending 4 days there instead of 5.

For context I (18 F) and my sister (16 F) have been at each others throats for YEARS, we’ve never gotten along and we’re complete opposites. She’s very stubborn and narcissistic. She flips issues she’s caused and makes herself into the victim. Unfortunately my mom has been letting her behaviour slide since I could remember. My stepdad has been in our lives since we were toddlers since our bio dad isn’t apart of our lives. He’s amazing, loving and supportive to the both of us. My sister however has had this attitude towards him because he puts his foot down when she’s being a see you next tuesday. She constantly brings up that he’s not her real dad, makes up issues about him “cheating” on my mom (it was confirmed not to be true), and is trying to break up my parents marriage. I have two younger half siblings 7 F and 6 M, it’s been difficult on them and they’re starting to mirror my sister’s behaviour. Onto the issue, my sister came downstairs to my room while I was in the middle of playing games on my pc and began bragging about how she’s trying to break them up again. My mom left her second phone at home and my sister went through their conversation, because of a fight my parents had about my sister being disrespectful and rude towards him. He’s apparently left for a couple of days to clear his head. I immediately yelled at my sister saying she needs a f***ing exorcism if she thought that what she was doing was okay. She starts yelling at me to shut up and slammed my door. I texted my mom and told her the situation and I haven’t heard anything yet. I have no idea what to do and I’m wondering if I should’ve said something different.

So, recently, my dad passed (Well actually not too recently, around the beginning of the year) and left me an '04 GT3. It's an extremely amazing car, along as the connection to my dad and my grandparent (who the car originally belonged to).

My wife has never really had issue with my having these (Even though she originally wanted to sell the inherited car). Issue only raised over this week because she wanted to drive the cars. Besides from the car I stated in the post, I have a few more. When she was leaving for work, she got in one of the cars, and before she left, I asked her why she was driving them. She then said ""Because it's a car and that's what cars do."" I then asked her what was wrong with her own car and she said nothing. I politely asked her to not drive any of these cars in the future unless she asked me for permission beforehand. 

When she came back from work, she seemed a bit annoyed at me, later to say that it was ridiculous to request that she not drive a *car* and that I'm never going to be driving two at once so there should be no issue.

10,1dzi7wn,AITA for bringing up a past situation when in an argument with my mother?,"**I'm using a throwaway here.**

***CONTEXT:*** My (**15f**) mother (**53f**) has a history of bad relationships. Her first husband ran out with their money, and her second husband (my father) wasn't a nice man at all. Her current partner (**60m**) is *controlling*. At the beginning it was fine; he was very strict but it wasn't *anger*. Then an incident happened in 2021 where he was convinced I had done something I hadn't and he completely ignored me for two months straight. Since then we have moved to a different country and Step-dad has been amicable since the incident but is incredibly petty. Example; If I make him a tea that has too much sugar? He has to drink mine as punishment. If I finish some food when he wanted it? I'm a 'leech' that is burning through his money. If I don't smile at him in the morning? I am being purposefully rude. If I admit that I feel upset by these things? I am being divisive.

**Yesterday** I got in an argument with my mum when she brought up inviting my cousin (15m) over to visit.

Cousin is someone who my mum has never liked. He was a very angry boy and I often had the task of caring for him when his own mum didn't. Due to this we are very close - more like brother and sister. The problem with him visiting is that she has already talked of cousin to step-dad who has expressed his distaste.

Cousin may not be prone to talking back, but he is still pretty defiant when told to act a certain way or not to. And, as you may have gathered, step-dad will not be able to handle any kind of defiance. I admit I can be a pushover when it comes to adults but cousin **is not**.

I expressed my hesitance to bring cousin over - saying that I was worried something could kick off. Mum defended step-dad and said that if cousin doesn't ""act like a little cunt"" that he won't bristle.

I argued back. I didn't shout, but I pushed my distaste for her words and that it isn't *him* who I am worried about. Mum continued to reiterate her point; that she doesn't see a problem with cousin coming over if I can tell her that he won't act out. I was confused that my words weren't registering, but she seemed hell-bent on cousin being the instigator.

And then what I was saying clicked and she got angry-which ended in me *actually* getting angry and arguing over how step-dad treats us. She said to me that when she talks to me about her relationships, that she is showing me that she trusts me- that she is on my side and will endanger her relationship and happiness for me.

And so I say without thinking;

""Well that wasn't the case in 2021 was it?""

And today she won't talk to me.

I feel bad for bringing it up when no one has mentioned it since, but all I could think of was how step-dad was back then while she watched. Her saying *that* felt like it ripped out the stitches on a wound that hasn't healed.

11,1dzi009,AITA for calling my uncle a small man?,"For a bit of backstory, I (25M) worked for my mom's sister's husband Jim (57?M) 7 years ago. I couldn't find an internship for the summer after my freshman year of college. I reached out to Jim who said I could apply for his company's intern position. I was accepted and Jim said I could live with him for the summer and borrow one of his cars since he lives in a different state. I was super thankful for the opportunity + housing and pretty excited because Jim was always known as the cool, charismatic uncle. But the summer was a bit of a nightmare. I learned Jim is feared and hated as a CEO. He's a huge micromanager and changes expectations on a whim which makes weeks of hard work useless. 


I wasn't spared as an intern. I was assigned a vaguely specified project that I was way under-qualified and underpaid for. Two weeks before my internship ended we had a check-in where he yelled at me and went back on a lot of his initial requirements. I put in 80 hour weeks for the rest of my time to salvage my project and make Jim happy. Jim was also a dick to live with. I was more than happy to do chores and help around but he treated me like a servant. But the worst incident was with the car he lent me. It had a busted bumper before I ever sat down in the driver's seat. I figured it caused by one of his alcoholic friends who he routinely lends his cars to. He eventually noticed the damage, blamed me for it, and forced me to pay for repairs. Oh well, lesson learned, take pictures of stuff you rent or borrow as insurance.


Even though my internship ended years ago, that summer really soured my opinion on Jim. We also later found out that he had a suspect relationship with one of the young HR girls at his company so my mom dislikes him too. But my aunt eventually worked through it with Jim. 


Anyways, my parents had a small family reunion and my aunt brought Jim so we had to put up with him for the weekend. Jim decided to spend the weekend fucking with our small elderly dog. Sliding her pad while she's sleeping, blowing air in her face, pretending like he was gonna give her table food then eating it himself, taking her toys and hiding them out of her reach, snapping in her face, etc. After Jim slid her pad again and laughed at her looking sad and pissed off, I said something like ""I guess the small man has to bully the small dog to feel better about himself"" (he's 5'6). He looked at me with a confused look and I followed up by saying that she isn't one of his [company] employees and she isn't paid to put up with his shit and be tormented by him. Long story short, my aunt said she couldn't believe how disrespectful I was after everything Jim has done for me. Jim tried to play it cool but made some dig about how I'm just a kid and I don't know how easy I have it. They expect an apology but I don't want to because Jim's an asshole.
