0,1e0wlu9,AITA for what I did to my boyfriend's parents,"I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (27M, we'll call D) since we were 13 & 14. I can't remember us ever even having severe fights or periods where we didn't talk. Despite this, I feel I may have screwed up royal by doing what I did. You see, I have a best friend (28M but non-binary, we'll call E). E and I have been best friends since before D and I got together. E and I have always hung out at each other's houses almost every weekend. It slowed down quite a bit as we got older, but I still spend a significant amount of time there. D has no issue with this because the both of us know that E has only ever been attracted to men and D trusts me fully. My boyfriend's parents, however, don't see it that way. My future In Laws suspect me of cheating with them. My boyfriend's mother is especially bad about this. Everyone hears about their nightmare mother-in-law, but this one is a different breed. She has always been overbearing on D and is one of the main reasons D and I have not tied the knot yet. I think this has to do partially with the fact that D's father wasn't in the picture most of his life, and his mother had to care for D. This is because MIL cheated on D's father, and he abandoned them. She is always making snide remarks about infidelity and suggesting that if I really loved D, I would cut E out of my life. One instance of this is last year when we went over their house for Christmas. The day was going very well. At dinner, everyone sat around the table and said grace. D's family is Christian, which I have no issue with, but I'm Jewish. Whenever I come over for Christmas, which Jews don't celebrate, I get side eyes and condescending looks from MIL. I always participate in Christmas though because I respect D's religion. He celebrates Hanukkah with me as well. When we said grace, MIL was staring at me the whole time. After, D and I were talking about how we had E over the week before. MIL took this opportunity to say something along the lines of, ""What with how greedy you people are, it's not surprising you want both E and my son."". Everyone paused in shock. D and I looked at each other. This was far from the first time MIL had said something like this, and I couldn't take it anymore. I told MIL that she isn't one to talk about cheating on account of what she did to D's father and that she's a racist piece of shit. The only thing I didn't know was that D's family was unaware of the fact that MIL cheated on D's father. MIL got offended and said that it was just so typical of my people to deny our sneaky and promiscuous natures and pin it on someone else. After this, D and I left. On the way home, D told me that I should've been more sensitive to her feelings and not told everyone she cheated. Now D's family is calling me an asshole and not speaking to me or D.

Because we couldn't do something big for graduation due to not being financially able to do so, my family and I decided back in May to put things off till August to my birthday AND my graduation.

Fast forward to this week, and my boyfriend lets me know that his friends are having a baby shower on the same day as my party was scheduled. We talked but originally disagreed with each other. For him, this is their first baby, and he wants to be there for this, as it is a major experience.

On my end, I recognized the importance and significance of the baby shower and his role in their lives. However, I am his boyfriend, and as selfish as it may sound, I feel like my party should take precedence. It warms my heart to have a partner who has been there for my birthday when others have overlooked it. I told him this and offered a solution of getting a list of items for them and taking them to dinner or lunch. At first, he wasn't open to the idea, because he felt that my birthday would always be more important than other events in life, which it would not be, and I expressed that further in conversation.

In order to make Celine feel better, a couple of our mutual friends and I spent some time together playing a few games and having conversations with her, eventually with all of us saying that Luke was the one at fault and cracking a few jokes on his explanations (To summarize, Luke backed out of the relationship because it took him a year to lose interest and call out red flags related to Celine which didn't make sense).

During the conversation where we joked around Luke, I wondered if a similar thing had happened with B where our friends came together and joked around my reason to breakup.

6,1e0bxid,AITA for snapping at my gf over a dog?,"
*Throwaway acc

Hi everyone,

I, 21F, am allergic to dogs and also have eczema and asthma. Whenever I’m around dogs or their dander, I experience severe reactions and eventually asthma flare-ups. I try to combat my allergies with a daily dose of Claritin because my mom has a dog and I’m home from college. 

My girlfriend wanted another puppy and a friend just had a litter he needed to get rid of. I agreed to get one for her under the following conditions:
1. The puppy would not be in my room; it would go into a carrier and then to her house.
2. The puppy would not be in my bed.
3. She would wash her hands after interacting with the puppy and before touching me.

(I know it was foolish of me to put myself in this situation in the first place.)

She ended up not wanting to go home and decided to stay the entire weekend at my house. She refused to take the puppy home because she didn’t trust her family to be alone with it.

To make a long story short, she didn’t follow through with ANY of the safeguards we agreed upon. When I started having a severe allergic reaction, she was upset because I was being “mean” to her and didn’t want to cuddle or talk much.

I had to take an hour-long cold shower at 3 a.m. because she didn’t want to put the puppy away and still didn’t wanna go home. I was drugged up on Benadryl and slept through most of the day because I couldn’t function. As I was waiting for the medicine to take over at one point, she placed her hand on my hip and asked me if I was okay. Pissed and struggling to breathe, I said, “please stop touching me.” That was the end of our interaction until we went out the next day.

Fast forward to a few days later, we’re talking about living together, and I asked what she would do with the puppy. I suggested keeping the puppy out of our bedroom or getting an apartment with separate rooms so I could have a dog-free space. She doesn’t think I should have my own room and got smart with me, asking, “Do I really expect her to keep her dog out of her room?”

This turned into a conversation about the past weekend, and she said, “Well, I didn’t know it mattered that much,” even though she has witnessed my allergic reactions before. She then followed up with, “I know you don’t even pet your dog, but I thought you were being dramatic.”

I felt disrespected and disregarded, and I don’t understand why I had to prove to her why she needed to uphold her end of the agreement, aside from the fact that it’s a very real allergy that she’s witnessed more than once. I don’t understand why she didn’t just respect my request. I’m worried this is a red flag. I don’t think I was mean to her, but you tell me.

 I (32F) went into my local chain coffee shop and decided to dine in instead of just doing drive-thru (100% procrastinating from my assignment due in 2 days).

Once I finished my food and was ready to go, I needed a lid for my coffee.  The shop had a softer flow of customers inside and in the drive-thru. I thought I could clear the table myself, so the next customers could sit down with no problem.

 So I took my plate up with me to ask for a lid. The barista happily acknowledged me as I walked up to the pickup windows and asked how everything was.

At this time I offered to come over more to take care of him more bc when I’d visit, his litterbox would be full like it hadn’t been cleaned but she said that it was fine & she would do it

Then last week she complained ab how he had made a mess with his litterbox & how there was some cat snot on her walls from when he was sick & she needs help cleaning it. She texted me that Monday night on the 1st so I offered to go Tuesday but she said she couldn’t bc she was busy & would be busy all week. I offered to clean alone but she said she didn’t want me to have to clean alone. So I assume she’s busy from the 1st-7th

Yesterday on the 9th she got mad at my roomie ab how I said I’d come to clean but *I* said I was busy & would need to find a day & then ghosted her when it was the complete opposite, which I can show through messages.

She also complained to him that I never gave her any $ for cat food & litter even tho I told her to lmk if she needed anything for him, which I assume included telling me if she needed $ for cat food/litter since idk how much the stuff she buys costs or how fast she’s going through it. I also assumed that since she hadn’t told me, that at the end of her watching him, she’d tell me how many bags of food/litter she went through for him & id reimburse her. 

I sent her this message: “Hiii, [Cat’s] vet appt is on Thursday [she knew he had an appointment prior to this, I just used it as an intro so it didn’t seem like I was coming at her idk] so I was wanting to know if it’d be alright to pick him up then. Also Ik you said you were busy all last week so I couldn’t come over to clean but since it’s Tuesday I was wondering if you have your new job’s work schedule yet & if you have any free days this week I can come over to do that or if you want me to just clean it by myself like I offered before. I just dk if you have any free days this week either”

It’s a bit passive aggressive but I wanted to include that she was the one who said she was busy, not me. She took almost 24hrs to respond but just said she’d be free for me to come over tomorrow to clean with her. I take him back fully in 4 days. But anyways, I’m just mad that she’s going around telling ppl I’m ignoring her or whatever but AITA or is it just miscommunication?

11,1e0bgre,WIBTA if I wanted to move in with my mom?,"WIBTA if I wanted to move in with my mom? 

For some context I flipped with my grandparents in and out for my entire life along with my little brother because both my mom and dad are addicted to drugs. I've cut all contacts with my dad because he was really abusive when I was little but my mom just got out of treatment and was asking me if I wanted to move back in with her. I was thinking about doing it because not only is she doing better I think would be better for my mental health. 

My grandparents have always favorited my cousin. For example if I was to get a B on a test I would be yelled at but it shoulders to get a C on it should be congratulated. And don't get me wrong it C are great a lot of people can't do that I'm just confused why a c is okay for her but a B isn't okay for me. Not only that she picks fights with me all the time and yes siblings are going to fight but every single time my grandparents take her side. Not only that but she'll victimize herself for everything and if she doesn't get her way or you fight back she'll hit you. And our grandparents don't do anything to stop it. She's even done it to my 8-year-old little brother. Not to mention once upon a time I asked for something and only a few days later my cousin had it. It just gets tiring. 

It's got me to the point where I'm $Hing. My grandparents know about this too and keep trying to make it look like it hurts then more than it hurts me. Not only that I'm not allowed to talk to my therapist about that because they're scared I'll be taken by DHS. Not only that but when I told them I liked girls they accepted me but then tried to blame it on the fact that I got mol3st3d as a kid. (Which didn't happen by the way) 

Now moving on to my mom. She's always supported me a 100% and accepted me fully when I told her I liked girls. She gives me so much more freedom than them and is overall just a great mom. My grandparents try to make her look like a villain for every single thing but I think they're forgetting she had her first kid when she was 14. (Me) But the problem is she lives a few cities away. So I moved in with her I wouldn't be losing my friends and my chance to graduate with an honors. Not only that I'd be living my band behind and all my activities. 

I don't know what I should do, I think I'm going to move back in with her because I don't know how long I can handle this house. Anyways would I be the A-hole?

12,1e0bgmy,AITA for not attempting to stop my neighbours puppy from coming into my yard?,"A neighbour has a new puppy. I don't know the neighbour well. The new puppy leaves their house, wanders down the road past several other houses and then slips under my gate.

My gate is really well designed to keep my very large dogs home. Its 2m tall and chain link. But it wasn't designed for a puppy, who can easily just slip under and come into my yard. There is no way for my dogs to get out, they are much too large.

I met the neighbour. The puppy came down the drive, and the owner appeared behind the puppy calling it back. The puppy ignored the owner and slipped under my gate. I said hello and told her that her puppy had visited. I said I have big dogs, and I wasn't going to supervise any play. The owner laughed it off and left.

When the puppy comes into my yard my dogs pretty much ignore it. They say hello, but then they don't care. The puppy will try get them to play which they might do a little bit, and then they just ignore the puppy and the puppy calms down and chills. My dogs are really well socialized but they prefer to play with dogs that are a similar size and age.

The puppy has visited most days. She comes over around midday and leaves around midafternoon. I ignore the puppy. I work from home.

My friends think I should be actively trying to do something about this situation - they suggest I could harass the owner, or call dog control, or the council, or get a new gate, or chase the puppy away every time.

I've been thinking I should ignore the problem. This might sound silly, but hear me out.

1. The puppy is not harming me, my dogs, or my house. Its just loitering.

2. If the puppy is going to wander anyway, it might as well wander over here where it will be safe and get socialization.

3. If the owner doesn't care that her puppy is roaming, I can't make her care.

4. We live in a very low income area. If the puppy gets picked up by the pound, the owner may not be able to afford to get the puppy back. Then the puppy will be put down.

5. Nobody calls the council or the cops around here, its the unwritten rule.

6. There are a lot of roaming dogs where I live. I don't let it bother me. Its none of my business.

7. Looking at the puppy, eventually she will grow too large to fit under my gate. This will naturally solve the problem on is own. Getting a new gate or altering my gate will be a lot of expense and effort for a short time.

8. Some other harm might befall the puppy while they are out and about. That would be sad and I hope it doesn't happen. But this will be outside my control. The owner will need to prevent this, not me.

There may be factors I am not considering. I confess I don't know much about dogs. I have two very good dogs but that was an accident.

In all, it does not seem like there is anything worthwhile to do so I'm tempted to ignore the situation and allow it to play out on its own.

13,1e0bbpt,AITA for walking out.,"So I (24f)  had already handed in my notice over a week ago but hadn’t heard anything back. 

Yesterday I sent an email to our department’s HR rep, asking if she knew when my last day would be/when I should return my equipment. 

Today I saw her out of office was on, so in general conversation I queried with the Assistant manager if she knew. The assistant manager went and asked HR on my behalf without my presence. 

She then called me back and said that I can choose whatever day provided I give them a certain amount of notice so they can calculate my final pay. She said that I was to email the HR main department email to query this. So I took her advice and did that. 

A few moments later I was invited to a meeting with the HR representative (60f) who was displaying as out of office. I joined this meeting, expecting a short, informative discussion, but instead was faced with a berating on how stressed she is and how I am ‘selfish’ for asking this question only 9 days after my resignation was put in. 

When I asked her what was wrong with what I asked, she shouted at me, saying ‘shut up, I am talking, you are listening’. I then asked her who her manager was as I no longer wish to deal with someone who sees that kind of behaviour to be professional. She then proceeded to say ‘are you really that stupid? You KNOW who my manager is’. The thing is, I really didn’t know. 

So I then raised a formal grievance against this HR rep. I couldn’t deal with this through my manager due to 2 reasons. 

1 being that my line manager is on leave and the other being that she is best friends with this HR rep. 

I have devoted 4 years to this company which have not been the easiest for me. I had major surgery which was meant to be a 12 week recovery policy, except I went back after the second week against my doctor’s advice because I wanted to ensure the company wouldn’t be overwhelmed. 

When I nursed my grandfather for 3 days as he passed away even when I had gained prior permission to do this when the time came back when he first got diagnosed with terminal cancer, I got a call from my line manager to tell me that I was unreliable for the fact I had taken these three days to nurse the man who was like my father, as he died. 

After this call with the HR rep, I then sent a short message to the assistant manager and stated that I will no longer be working for this company and my notice period is now null and void. 

I also sent a formal letter of complaint to this HR rep’s boss (I found her through our system in the end). I will not be logging back on and devoting any more of my time to a company like this.

14,1e0b9jv,AITA for setting boundaries with my partner to not be interrupted during calls ,"My partner and I recently haven’t been seeing each other as much. We agreed due to finances that for a while we will hold off on hanging out. Its been a month since we stopped meeting up, he recently started a new job and i’m currently looking for work.  Originally we agreed that since we’re both currently not financially ok, we will meet up again when we are. For reference we live 1.5 hrs away and he’s the only one who drives. I dont visit him because he’s worried his family/people he knows will see us ( he is Asian- a cultural thing since we’re not married- we both are in the same religion) 

Since then I have asked that if we cant meet as much, let’s call more. He agreed and yet he hasn’t arranged any calls. Ive mentioned it to him about us calling more which he keeps telling me he’s too busy or too tired. I’ve started to get a bit sick of being understanding and patient as he has had time to watch majority of the euro 24s, play xbox, go to football practice and do the rest of his time focused on family and work. I dont expect him not to do those things at all, they’re necessary and part of life. But, i would like some call time with him and to be fitted in as well rather than being told he’s busy or too tired. Ive started to feel like I dont matter anymore and i’m not a priority and he’s not set any timeline of how long this will continue for. He keeps telling me to focus on myself, and yet. I do. I spend a lot of time with friends and looking for work. I have been doing a coding course and cybersecurity course too. So it angers me he’s acting like my world revolves around him. 

After begging for a while that we set up days to call and make sure they’re priority. I let him know. 1 - id like at least one of these calls not to be short and 2- id like our calls to focus on us and not be interrupted by his mum. He lives with his mum and they do spend time with each other. Anyway he got really mad at me because I expected to not be uninterrupted. He keeps saying im putting conditions on these calls when I am just putting boundaries on them since we dont spend time with each other anymore and these calls will be our quality time.  I feel so frustrated that we dont see each other in person and finally when I get 2 calls a week apparently it’s too much to ask for them to be not interrupted???

Originally we agreed that since we’re both currently not financially ok, we will meet up again when we are. For reference we live 1.5 hrs away and he’s the only one who drives. I dont visit him because he’s worried his family/people he knows will see us ( he is Asian- a cultural thing since we’re not married- we both are in the same religion) 

Since then I have asked that if we cant meet as much, let’s call more. He agreed and yet he hasn’t arranged any calls. Ive mentioned it to him about us calling more which he keeps telling me he’s too busy or too tired. I’ve started to get a bit sick of being understanding and patient as he has had time to watch majority of the euro 24s, play xbox, go to football practice and do the rest of his time focused on family and work. I dont expect him not to do those things at all, they’re necessary and part of life. But, i would like some call time with him and to be fitted in as well rather than being told he’s busy or too tired. Ive started to feel like I dont matter anymore and i’m not a priority and he’s not set any timeline of how long this will continue for. He keeps telling me to focus on myself, and yet. I do. I spend a lot of time with friends and looking for work. I have been doing a coding course and cybersecurity course too. So it angers me he’s acting like my world revolves around him. 

After begging for a while that we set up days to call and make sure they’re priority. I let him know. 1 - id like at least one of these calls not to be short and 2- id like our calls to focus on us and not be interrupted by his mum. He lives with his mum and they do spend time with each other. Anyway he got really mad at me because I expected to not be uninterrupted. He keeps saying im putting conditions on these calls when I am just putting boundaries on them since we dont spend time with each other anymore and these calls will be our quality time.  I feel so frustrated that we dont see each other in person and finally when I get 2 calls a week apparently it’s too much to ask for them to be not interrupted??? 

Right now… we are on the edge of breaking up.

15,1e0b8y4,"AITA? Boyfriend is busy/stressed, I try to help, he keeps standing me up","Hey everyone! I need to know if I am the asshole here.

I am 26F, dating a 39M (he's 40 next month). We have been in a relationship for about 9 months now (since October 2023). He owns multiple international businesses and is very busy. I am a recent graduate who works as a holistic health coach. We have had regular dates in the beginning of our relationship, now things have changed. 

He e began to cancel/postpone more and more, now it's about 40% of the time. Each time, he 'makes it up with gifts or money'. It feels gross and I feel cheap. Yet even now, that 'making up' waning while he continues to cancel. I have talked to him about it, he apologizes, yet says there's not much he can do for now because his main company is gearing up for a huge lawsuit. I understand that he is stressed and busy, yet it is not an excuse. I have tried to support him with talks, homemade meals, relaxing dates, yet he keeps pushing me away 'I don't need your help.' We all experience tough times yet you try to show up for those you love or at least communicate.

  
Things got rocky between us in the spring, so I left to another country for a fun work opportunity for a month. While there, he called and texted like crazy, saying I was too far, he missed me and wanted to see me.

Now, I am back in the states, in an agreed upon location, in a hotel, waiting for him to join me (he has paid for everything). He says he may have to cancel for work. I am just enjoying the trip, charging his card for shopping, spa treatments, etc. I planned so many activities and relaxing dates for us both, which he agreed to, now I am doing them all alone.

I feel torn -- he physically provides and I want for nothing yet he doesn't always show up. I am with him for HIM, this extra stuff is just icing. I miss him and I feel lonely even surrounded by this luxury. He thinks I am being sensitive and I should just understand that work/his legal stuff is a priority. He also wants me to stop using his card even though it's normal for us...  My mom and sister thinks he's cheating and that's why he doesn't want me to spend his money anymore (they have been cheated on). My friends simply think he's emotionally unavailable and unreliable. Thoughts? Advice?

16,1e0b5ag,AITA for refusing to finish a present for an ex?,"Context:

  
I (23F) was broken up with by my ex (32M). We had been together for approximately a year. We live together and share most things. I work full-time and will be going back to school in the fall. For the entire length of our relationship, my ex has been unemployed.

  
I wanted to do something nice for my ex because I had begun therapy and as a recommended self-care activity, my therapist recommended doing something I enjoy. I chose to crochet because I find it relaxing and like having something to show for it.

  
My ex had been feeling really low lately being that we both suffer from depressive spells and his are frequent. He pulls his weight where can he with dishes, or going out to run errands for me, and taking care of my pets but I took on the sole financial burden for everything. I wanted to show him that despite that, I did appreciate our time together and did care about him a lot so I decided to crochet him a full-sized blanket.

We spent a ton of time searching for the right yarn and trying to figure out the perfect pattern for him and I spent a lot of money collecting the supplies. Anyone who crochet knows the time and energy it takes is no small feat but I worked on it for hours each day. 

  
Well, about a month making into it, he broke up with me. Unfortunately, we still live together as he knew I was going back to school and currently, it is not feasible for me to live alone but I have since asked him to pay me back for a few of the things that were not just because I loved him/gifts. 

  
I included the blanket on this list because it is not an inexpensive venture and I can't reuse a lot of the yarn and other supplies sadly. He told me that this was really hurtful because it was something I was making out of love for him. While that is true, I can't justify a thousand-dollar blanket because I loved someone before they broke up with me. I definitely can't justify spending hours more making it either.
