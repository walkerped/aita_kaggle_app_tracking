0,1e0wlu9,AITA for what I did to my boyfriend's parents,"I (28F) have been dating my boyfriend (27M, we'll call D) since we were 13 & 14. I can't remember us ever even having severe fights or periods where we didn't talk. Despite this, I feel I may have screwed up royal by doing what I did. You see, I have a best friend (28M but non-binary, we'll call E). E and I have been best friends since before D and I got together. E and I have always hung out at each other's houses almost every weekend. It slowed down quite a bit as we got older, but I still spend a significant amount of time there. D has no issue with this because the both of us know that E has only ever been attracted to men and D trusts me fully. My boyfriend's parents, however, don't see it that way. My future In Laws suspect me of cheating with them. My boyfriend's mother is especially bad about this. Everyone hears about their nightmare mother-in-law, but this one is a different breed. She has always been overbearing on D and is one of the main reasons D and I have not tied the knot yet. I think this has to do partially with the fact that D's father wasn't in the picture most of his life, and his mother had to care for D. This is because MIL cheated on D's father, and he abandoned them. She is always making snide remarks about infidelity and suggesting that if I really loved D, I would cut E out of my life. One instance of this is last year when we went over their house for Christmas. The day was going very well. At dinner, everyone sat around the table and said grace. D's family is Christian, which I have no issue with, but I'm Jewish. Whenever I come over for Christmas, which Jews don't celebrate, I get side eyes and condescending looks from MIL. I always participate in Christmas though because I respect D's religion. He celebrates Hanukkah with me as well. When we said grace, MIL was staring at me the whole time. After, D and I were talking about how we had E over the week before. MIL took this opportunity to say something along the lines of, ""What with how greedy you people are, it's not surprising you want both E and my son."". Everyone paused in shock. D and I looked at each other. This was far from the first time MIL had said something like this, and I couldn't take it anymore. I told MIL that she isn't one to talk about cheating on account of what she did to D's father and that she's a racist piece of shit. The only thing I didn't know was that D's family was unaware of the fact that MIL cheated on D's father. MIL got offended and said that it was just so typical of my people to deny our sneaky and promiscuous natures and pin it on someone else. After this, D and I left. On the way home, D told me that I should've been more sensitive to her feelings and not told everyone she cheated. Now D's family is calling me an asshole and not speaking to me or D.

Because we couldn't do something big for graduation due to not being financially able to do so, my family and I decided back in May to put things off till August to my birthday AND my graduation.

Fast forward to this week, and my boyfriend lets me know that his friends are having a baby shower on the same day as my party was scheduled. We talked but originally disagreed with each other. For him, this is their first baby, and he wants to be there for this, as it is a major experience.

On my end, I recognized the importance and significance of the baby shower and his role in their lives. However, I am his boyfriend, and as selfish as it may sound, I feel like my party should take precedence. It warms my heart to have a partner who has been there for my birthday when others have overlooked it. I told him this and offered a solution of getting a list of items for them and taking them to dinner or lunch. At first, he wasn't open to the idea, because he felt that my birthday would always be more important than other events in life, which it would not be, and I expressed that further in conversation.

In order to make Celine feel better, a couple of our mutual friends and I spent some time together playing a few games and having conversations with her, eventually with all of us saying that Luke was the one at fault and cracking a few jokes on his explanations (To summarize, Luke backed out of the relationship because it took him a year to lose interest and call out red flags related to Celine which didn't make sense).

During the conversation where we joked around Luke, I wondered if a similar thing had happened with B where our friends came together and joked around my reason to breakup.

6,1e0bxid,AITA for snapping at my gf over a dog?,"
*Throwaway acc

Hi everyone,

I, 21F, am allergic to dogs and also have eczema and asthma. Whenever I’m around dogs or their dander, I experience severe reactions and eventually asthma flare-ups. I try to combat my allergies with a daily dose of Claritin because my mom has a dog and I’m home from college. 

My girlfriend wanted another puppy and a friend just had a litter he needed to get rid of. I agreed to get one for her under the following conditions:
1. The puppy would not be in my room; it would go into a carrier and then to her house.
2. The puppy would not be in my bed.
3. She would wash her hands after interacting with the puppy and before touching me.

(I know it was foolish of me to put myself in this situation in the first place.)

She ended up not wanting to go home and decided to stay the entire weekend at my house. She refused to take the puppy home because she didn’t trust her family to be alone with it.

To make a long story short, she didn’t follow through with ANY of the safeguards we agreed upon. When I started having a severe allergic reaction, she was upset because I was being “mean” to her and didn’t want to cuddle or talk much.

I had to take an hour-long cold shower at 3 a.m. because she didn’t want to put the puppy away and still didn’t wanna go home. I was drugged up on Benadryl and slept through most of the day because I couldn’t function. As I was waiting for the medicine to take over at one point, she placed her hand on my hip and asked me if I was okay. Pissed and struggling to breathe, I said, “please stop touching me.” That was the end of our interaction until we went out the next day.

Fast forward to a few days later, we’re talking about living together, and I asked what she would do with the puppy. I suggested keeping the puppy out of our bedroom or getting an apartment with separate rooms so I could have a dog-free space. She doesn’t think I should have my own room and got smart with me, asking, “Do I really expect her to keep her dog out of her room?”

This turned into a conversation about the past weekend, and she said, “Well, I didn’t know it mattered that much,” even though she has witnessed my allergic reactions before. She then followed up with, “I know you don’t even pet your dog, but I thought you were being dramatic.”

I felt disrespected and disregarded, and I don’t understand why I had to prove to her why she needed to uphold her end of the agreement, aside from the fact that it’s a very real allergy that she’s witnessed more than once. I don’t understand why she didn’t just respect my request. I’m worried this is a red flag. I don’t think I was mean to her, but you tell me.

 I (32F) went into my local chain coffee shop and decided to dine in instead of just doing drive-thru (100% procrastinating from my assignment due in 2 days).

Once I finished my food and was ready to go, I needed a lid for my coffee.  The shop had a softer flow of customers inside and in the drive-thru. I thought I could clear the table myself, so the next customers could sit down with no problem.

 So I took my plate up with me to ask for a lid. The barista happily acknowledged me as I walked up to the pickup windows and asked how everything was.

At this time I offered to come over more to take care of him more bc when I’d visit, his litterbox would be full like it hadn’t been cleaned but she said that it was fine & she would do it

Then last week she complained ab how he had made a mess with his litterbox & how there was some cat snot on her walls from when he was sick & she needs help cleaning it. She texted me that Monday night on the 1st so I offered to go Tuesday but she said she couldn’t bc she was busy & would be busy all week. I offered to clean alone but she said she didn’t want me to have to clean alone. So I assume she’s busy from the 1st-7th

Yesterday on the 9th she got mad at my roomie ab how I said I’d come to clean but *I* said I was busy & would need to find a day & then ghosted her when it was the complete opposite, which I can show through messages.

She also complained to him that I never gave her any $ for cat food & litter even tho I told her to lmk if she needed anything for him, which I assume included telling me if she needed $ for cat food/litter since idk how much the stuff she buys costs or how fast she’s going through it. I also assumed that since she hadn’t told me, that at the end of her watching him, she’d tell me how many bags of food/litter she went through for him & id reimburse her. 

I sent her this message: “Hiii, [Cat’s] vet appt is on Thursday [she knew he had an appointment prior to this, I just used it as an intro so it didn’t seem like I was coming at her idk] so I was wanting to know if it’d be alright to pick him up then. Also Ik you said you were busy all last week so I couldn’t come over to clean but since it’s Tuesday I was wondering if you have your new job’s work schedule yet & if you have any free days this week I can come over to do that or if you want me to just clean it by myself like I offered before. I just dk if you have any free days this week either”

It’s a bit passive aggressive but I wanted to include that she was the one who said she was busy, not me. She took almost 24hrs to respond but just said she’d be free for me to come over tomorrow to clean with her. I take him back fully in 4 days. But anyways, I’m just mad that she’s going around telling ppl I’m ignoring her or whatever but AITA or is it just miscommunication?

11,1e0bgre,WIBTA if I wanted to move in with my mom?,"WIBTA if I wanted to move in with my mom? 

For some context I flipped with my grandparents in and out for my entire life along with my little brother because both my mom and dad are addicted to drugs. I've cut all contacts with my dad because he was really abusive when I was little but my mom just got out of treatment and was asking me if I wanted to move back in with her. I was thinking about doing it because not only is she doing better I think would be better for my mental health. 

My grandparents have always favorited my cousin. For example if I was to get a B on a test I would be yelled at but it shoulders to get a C on it should be congratulated. And don't get me wrong it C are great a lot of people can't do that I'm just confused why a c is okay for her but a B isn't okay for me. Not only that she picks fights with me all the time and yes siblings are going to fight but every single time my grandparents take her side. Not only that but she'll victimize herself for everything and if she doesn't get her way or you fight back she'll hit you. And our grandparents don't do anything to stop it. She's even done it to my 8-year-old little brother. Not to mention once upon a time I asked for something and only a few days later my cousin had it. It just gets tiring. 

It's got me to the point where I'm $Hing. My grandparents know about this too and keep trying to make it look like it hurts then more than it hurts me. Not only that I'm not allowed to talk to my therapist about that because they're scared I'll be taken by DHS. Not only that but when I told them I liked girls they accepted me but then tried to blame it on the fact that I got mol3st3d as a kid. (Which didn't happen by the way) 

Now moving on to my mom. She's always supported me a 100% and accepted me fully when I told her I liked girls. She gives me so much more freedom than them and is overall just a great mom. My grandparents try to make her look like a villain for every single thing but I think they're forgetting she had her first kid when she was 14. (Me) But the problem is she lives a few cities away. So I moved in with her I wouldn't be losing my friends and my chance to graduate with an honors. Not only that I'd be living my band behind and all my activities. 

I don't know what I should do, I think I'm going to move back in with her because I don't know how long I can handle this house. Anyways would I be the A-hole?

12,1e0bgmy,AITA for not attempting to stop my neighbours puppy from coming into my yard?,"A neighbour has a new puppy. I don't know the neighbour well. The new puppy leaves their house, wanders down the road past several other houses and then slips under my gate.

My gate is really well designed to keep my very large dogs home. Its 2m tall and chain link. But it wasn't designed for a puppy, who can easily just slip under and come into my yard. There is no way for my dogs to get out, they are much too large.

I met the neighbour. The puppy came down the drive, and the owner appeared behind the puppy calling it back. The puppy ignored the owner and slipped under my gate. I said hello and told her that her puppy had visited. I said I have big dogs, and I wasn't going to supervise any play. The owner laughed it off and left.

When the puppy comes into my yard my dogs pretty much ignore it. They say hello, but then they don't care. The puppy will try get them to play which they might do a little bit, and then they just ignore the puppy and the puppy calms down and chills. My dogs are really well socialized but they prefer to play with dogs that are a similar size and age.

The puppy has visited most days. She comes over around midday and leaves around midafternoon. I ignore the puppy. I work from home.

My friends think I should be actively trying to do something about this situation - they suggest I could harass the owner, or call dog control, or the council, or get a new gate, or chase the puppy away every time.

I've been thinking I should ignore the problem. This might sound silly, but hear me out.

1. The puppy is not harming me, my dogs, or my house. Its just loitering.

2. If the puppy is going to wander anyway, it might as well wander over here where it will be safe and get socialization.

3. If the owner doesn't care that her puppy is roaming, I can't make her care.

4. We live in a very low income area. If the puppy gets picked up by the pound, the owner may not be able to afford to get the puppy back. Then the puppy will be put down.

5. Nobody calls the council or the cops around here, its the unwritten rule.

6. There are a lot of roaming dogs where I live. I don't let it bother me. Its none of my business.

7. Looking at the puppy, eventually she will grow too large to fit under my gate. This will naturally solve the problem on is own. Getting a new gate or altering my gate will be a lot of expense and effort for a short time.

8. Some other harm might befall the puppy while they are out and about. That would be sad and I hope it doesn't happen. But this will be outside my control. The owner will need to prevent this, not me.

There may be factors I am not considering. I confess I don't know much about dogs. I have two very good dogs but that was an accident.

In all, it does not seem like there is anything worthwhile to do so I'm tempted to ignore the situation and allow it to play out on its own.

13,1e0bbpt,AITA for walking out.,"So I (24f)  had already handed in my notice over a week ago but hadn’t heard anything back. 

Yesterday I sent an email to our department’s HR rep, asking if she knew when my last day would be/when I should return my equipment. 

Today I saw her out of office was on, so in general conversation I queried with the Assistant manager if she knew. The assistant manager went and asked HR on my behalf without my presence. 

She then called me back and said that I can choose whatever day provided I give them a certain amount of notice so they can calculate my final pay. She said that I was to email the HR main department email to query this. So I took her advice and did that. 

A few moments later I was invited to a meeting with the HR representative (60f) who was displaying as out of office. I joined this meeting, expecting a short, informative discussion, but instead was faced with a berating on how stressed she is and how I am ‘selfish’ for asking this question only 9 days after my resignation was put in. 

When I asked her what was wrong with what I asked, she shouted at me, saying ‘shut up, I am talking, you are listening’. I then asked her who her manager was as I no longer wish to deal with someone who sees that kind of behaviour to be professional. She then proceeded to say ‘are you really that stupid? You KNOW who my manager is’. The thing is, I really didn’t know. 

So I then raised a formal grievance against this HR rep. I couldn’t deal with this through my manager due to 2 reasons. 

1 being that my line manager is on leave and the other being that she is best friends with this HR rep. 

I have devoted 4 years to this company which have not been the easiest for me. I had major surgery which was meant to be a 12 week recovery policy, except I went back after the second week against my doctor’s advice because I wanted to ensure the company wouldn’t be overwhelmed. 

When I nursed my grandfather for 3 days as he passed away even when I had gained prior permission to do this when the time came back when he first got diagnosed with terminal cancer, I got a call from my line manager to tell me that I was unreliable for the fact I had taken these three days to nurse the man who was like my father, as he died. 

After this call with the HR rep, I then sent a short message to the assistant manager and stated that I will no longer be working for this company and my notice period is now null and void. 

I also sent a formal letter of complaint to this HR rep’s boss (I found her through our system in the end). I will not be logging back on and devoting any more of my time to a company like this.

14,1e0b9jv,AITA for setting boundaries with my partner to not be interrupted during calls ,"My partner and I recently haven’t been seeing each other as much. We agreed due to finances that for a while we will hold off on hanging out. Its been a month since we stopped meeting up, he recently started a new job and i’m currently looking for work.  Originally we agreed that since we’re both currently not financially ok, we will meet up again when we are. For reference we live 1.5 hrs away and he’s the only one who drives. I dont visit him because he’s worried his family/people he knows will see us ( he is Asian- a cultural thing since we’re not married- we both are in the same religion) 

Since then I have asked that if we cant meet as much, let’s call more. He agreed and yet he hasn’t arranged any calls. Ive mentioned it to him about us calling more which he keeps telling me he’s too busy or too tired. I’ve started to get a bit sick of being understanding and patient as he has had time to watch majority of the euro 24s, play xbox, go to football practice and do the rest of his time focused on family and work. I dont expect him not to do those things at all, they’re necessary and part of life. But, i would like some call time with him and to be fitted in as well rather than being told he’s busy or too tired. Ive started to feel like I dont matter anymore and i’m not a priority and he’s not set any timeline of how long this will continue for. He keeps telling me to focus on myself, and yet. I do. I spend a lot of time with friends and looking for work. I have been doing a coding course and cybersecurity course too. So it angers me he’s acting like my world revolves around him. 

After begging for a while that we set up days to call and make sure they’re priority. I let him know. 1 - id like at least one of these calls not to be short and 2- id like our calls to focus on us and not be interrupted by his mum. He lives with his mum and they do spend time with each other. Anyway he got really mad at me because I expected to not be uninterrupted. He keeps saying im putting conditions on these calls when I am just putting boundaries on them since we dont spend time with each other anymore and these calls will be our quality time.  I feel so frustrated that we dont see each other in person and finally when I get 2 calls a week apparently it’s too much to ask for them to be not interrupted???

Originally we agreed that since we’re both currently not financially ok, we will meet up again when we are. For reference we live 1.5 hrs away and he’s the only one who drives. I dont visit him because he’s worried his family/people he knows will see us ( he is Asian- a cultural thing since we’re not married- we both are in the same religion) 

Since then I have asked that if we cant meet as much, let’s call more. He agreed and yet he hasn’t arranged any calls. Ive mentioned it to him about us calling more which he keeps telling me he’s too busy or too tired. I’ve started to get a bit sick of being understanding and patient as he has had time to watch majority of the euro 24s, play xbox, go to football practice and do the rest of his time focused on family and work. I dont expect him not to do those things at all, they’re necessary and part of life. But, i would like some call time with him and to be fitted in as well rather than being told he’s busy or too tired. Ive started to feel like I dont matter anymore and i’m not a priority and he’s not set any timeline of how long this will continue for. He keeps telling me to focus on myself, and yet. I do. I spend a lot of time with friends and looking for work. I have been doing a coding course and cybersecurity course too. So it angers me he’s acting like my world revolves around him. 

After begging for a while that we set up days to call and make sure they’re priority. I let him know. 1 - id like at least one of these calls not to be short and 2- id like our calls to focus on us and not be interrupted by his mum. He lives with his mum and they do spend time with each other. Anyway he got really mad at me because I expected to not be uninterrupted. He keeps saying im putting conditions on these calls when I am just putting boundaries on them since we dont spend time with each other anymore and these calls will be our quality time.  I feel so frustrated that we dont see each other in person and finally when I get 2 calls a week apparently it’s too much to ask for them to be not interrupted??? 

Right now… we are on the edge of breaking up.

15,1e0b8y4,"AITA? Boyfriend is busy/stressed, I try to help, he keeps standing me up","Hey everyone! I need to know if I am the asshole here.

I am 26F, dating a 39M (he's 40 next month). We have been in a relationship for about 9 months now (since October 2023). He owns multiple international businesses and is very busy. I am a recent graduate who works as a holistic health coach. We have had regular dates in the beginning of our relationship, now things have changed. 

He e began to cancel/postpone more and more, now it's about 40% of the time. Each time, he 'makes it up with gifts or money'. It feels gross and I feel cheap. Yet even now, that 'making up' waning while he continues to cancel. I have talked to him about it, he apologizes, yet says there's not much he can do for now because his main company is gearing up for a huge lawsuit. I understand that he is stressed and busy, yet it is not an excuse. I have tried to support him with talks, homemade meals, relaxing dates, yet he keeps pushing me away 'I don't need your help.' We all experience tough times yet you try to show up for those you love or at least communicate.

  
Things got rocky between us in the spring, so I left to another country for a fun work opportunity for a month. While there, he called and texted like crazy, saying I was too far, he missed me and wanted to see me.

Now, I am back in the states, in an agreed upon location, in a hotel, waiting for him to join me (he has paid for everything). He says he may have to cancel for work. I am just enjoying the trip, charging his card for shopping, spa treatments, etc. I planned so many activities and relaxing dates for us both, which he agreed to, now I am doing them all alone.

I feel torn -- he physically provides and I want for nothing yet he doesn't always show up. I am with him for HIM, this extra stuff is just icing. I miss him and I feel lonely even surrounded by this luxury. He thinks I am being sensitive and I should just understand that work/his legal stuff is a priority. He also wants me to stop using his card even though it's normal for us...  My mom and sister thinks he's cheating and that's why he doesn't want me to spend his money anymore (they have been cheated on). My friends simply think he's emotionally unavailable and unreliable.

16,1e0b5ag,AITA for refusing to finish a present for an ex?,"Context:

  
I (23F) was broken up with by my ex (32M). We had been together for approximately a year. We live together and share most things. I work full-time and will be going back to school in the fall. For the entire length of our relationship, my ex has been unemployed.

  
I wanted to do something nice for my ex because I had begun therapy and as a recommended self-care activity, my therapist recommended doing something I enjoy. I chose to crochet because I find it relaxing and like having something to show for it.

  
My ex had been feeling really low lately being that we both suffer from depressive spells and his are frequent. He pulls his weight where can he with dishes, or going out to run errands for me, and taking care of my pets but I took on the sole financial burden for everything. I wanted to show him that despite that, I did appreciate our time together and did care about him a lot so I decided to crochet him a full-sized blanket.

We spent a ton of time searching for the right yarn and trying to figure out the perfect pattern for him and I spent a lot of money collecting the supplies. Anyone who crochet knows the time and energy it takes is no small feat but I worked on it for hours each day. 

  
Well, about a month making into it, he broke up with me. Unfortunately, we still live together as he knew I was going back to school and currently, it is not feasible for me to live alone but I have since asked him to pay me back for a few of the things that were not just because I loved him/gifts. 

  
I included the blanket on this list because it is not an inexpensive venture and I can't reuse a lot of the yarn and other supplies sadly. He told me that this was really hurtful because it was something I was making out of love for him. While that is true, I can't justify a thousand-dollar blanket because I loved someone before they broke up with me. I definitely can't justify spending hours more making it either.

My mom decided we should wrap things up early and go home (my little brother (8M) was acting up, so it wasn’t just me.

Anyways, when we got home Miley came into my room and told me how I was “being selfish and that I ruined the shopping trip” and it was my fault we had to leave early because I wasn’t just accepting the fact that I’m fat, and that I was being all dramatic for no reason

Me (F, 26) and my husband (M, 30) have a son who just turned 3. Our kiddo was the first born out of our generation in the family. 

Last year my Husbands brother (27) started dating and got married to his current wife. They started dating in June and were married by September. She had been divorced and has a kid of her own, who’s 7. I must say, she is a really great person. I’m glad he found her and all that good stuff, we’re going to call her Z (random letter) 

Z’s son has some struggles. He’ll kick, scream, throw things, hit, cuss, and run away from his parents. I’m sure he’s got some underlying things there, especially with the divorce. He goes to therapy but I’m sure he’s been through some shit. 

My child is the opposite, very calm and really only invested in playing with his Spiderman. I would love to say that it’s our wonderful parenting but no- we just lucked out with a very mild-tempered kid. He can pitch a fit if he wants to, but usually doesn’t. 

The big issue is now one of my husbands cousins is getting married, and they invited our kid and not Z’s. Z and her husband got upset and said they aren’t going, and then asked my husband if we were still going. He said yes, and they WERE fine with it until this week. 

At my mother in laws house we had dinner and of course the wedding came up. Z angrily said “Don’t tell our cousin or she’ll uninvite us from something else.” My MIL tried to make light and said, “Uncle H hasn’t seen the first grandbaby yet, that’s probably why.” 

Z blew up and pointed out her son was born first, so he is the first grandchild. Z stormed out, her husband followed, and told us if we take our son to the wedding that’s disrespectful to them. We haven’t said anything yet besides “Let’s all cool down and talk about it later.” Am I the Asshole for wanting to still go with our son?

I want to start with, I have only ever seen him as a brother to me, and he had asked me out a couple times our freshman year and I rejected him every single time because I saw him like a brother. Despite all of this, we were extremely close, finishing each other’s sentences, knowing what the other was thinking without saying anything, and were referred to as PLATONIC soulmates.

23,1e12dpt,AITA for using my sister's stuff behind her back?,"I (F21) have an older half sister ""Madison"" (F23). We have the same dad, different moms. Up until she was 17 (I was 15) she lived with her mom in a different state. Due to some financial issues with her mom, my parents decided to let Madison move in with us.

I'm my parent's only child so we live in a 2 bedroom house, so when Madison moved in we had to share a room and it's been that way since. For some added context me and Madison are very different so as time has gone on, she's tried to completely change the room's ""aesthetic"" which has just been pissing me off for a long time (if you want a funny comparison, look up Sam and Cat's bedroom, that's basically what's going on here) 

Anyway the main issue, is we also share a bathroom and considering me and Madison both have jobs, we buy our own soap, shampoo, body lotion etc. I've noticed over time that whenever Madison runs out of something she'll start using the stuff I've bought for myself (I use a lot of expensive products so that's obviously annoying). I never really confront her cause I make more money than her and I started ""hiding"" my stuff so she doesn't use it. Recently I've noticed that she found my ""stash"" of extra products so I decided to retaliate and start using her more expensive stuff (her nice perfume, her nicer makeup etc) 

She immediately noticed that her stuff was being used and she confronted me saying that I need to ask permission to use her things and I told her that she should've been asking me for permission the entire time she's used my stuff. She went to my parents about it and they sorta brushed it off as ""sister drama"" and told us we need to sort this out on our own cause they aren't gonna get involved. 

Anyway Madison got really upset and just packed up some things and she's been at her boyfriend's house for a couple days. I've tried texting her saying to drop it cause it's such an immature problem, but no response.

Fast forward to yesterday (July 10 10 am) when I followed up with them again, acknowledging their family issues, saying I hope things were better, and asking if they could get me feedback “within the next few days” and explaining that there was a time sensitive reason for the request.

Here's where it gets complicated. My parents divorced when I was 5, and my dad remarried when I was 10. He had two children (now 20F and 18M) with my stepmother. Growing up, I saw my dad every other weekend, but we weren't particularly close. He seemed more involved with his ""new"" family.

Now that the will has been read, my stepmother and half-siblings are furious. They claim my father promised them he'd ""take care of everyone"" and are demanding I split the inheritance equally among all three of us kids.

I don't want to. While I'm not close with my half-siblings, I don't dislike them. But I feel like this inheritance is making up for years of my dad being less present in my life. Plus, I have student loans to pay off and was hoping to use some of the money for a down payment on a house.

My stepmother is threatening legal action, though the lawyer says the will is solid. My mom thinks I should keep it all, but some friends say I'm being greedy and should share with my half-siblings.

26,1e11zbt,AITA for getting my (27F) housemate's (25F) BF (46M) to move out of our place?,"(sorry if not enough detail, will answer Qs)

I live w 3 ppl (25F x2, 27M). One 25F has been with her BF (46M) \~18months. In Jan he wanted to renew his lease but his landlord said no bc he wanted to sell. When the lease came to an end the BF stayed and I guess entered a kind of gentleman's agreement where he could essentially squat without a contract while paying rent.

This lasted \~4months. 2months ago (start of May), BF couldn't pay rent as he was at the bottom of his overdraft and landlord made him leave.

My housemate asked just the girls if he could stay 1-2wks. We said OK, that evening I asked about logistics, she said it'd be 1-2weeks and he had a viewing & she didn't know what to do but he needed to sort some things out in his life, especially regarding money. I was clear to her that it wasn't an ideal situation but understood. She didn't ask our 27M housemate & he moved out (semi-related).

6wks pass and BF went to 1 viewing, and wasn't doing anything different to how he'd previously lived/worked that had gotten him into the situation, but I didn't want to get in his business too much. My concern was it had quietly shifted from '1-2wk emergency' to 'indefinite', w/out asking.

This wouldn't have come up but we needed a new housemate & I said we need to know what's happening. She was receptive but when I suggested a timeline of six weeks, she said that was too short & ""it's things like this that show how people can't get out of the mess they're in because everyone turns a blind eye and can be quite brutal"". This rly pissed me off as it'd already been 4 weeks longer than we'd agreed, and I was proposing a timeline that would make it 12wks in general, and to say this to us all felt really unfair.

We had an argument & she was adamant we're coldhearted by not accepting him indefinitely, and I said a couple flippant things I regret. We had another full blown argument later where she was rude and personally insulted me, changed her story, was volatile and aggressive. She thinks that bc she's stressed and having to respond to his changing situation (e.g. despite not paying rent or bills for 2months he's apparently still at the bottom of his overdraft?), we shouldn't be mad we aren't getting asked about the developments.

I, 16F, have a little brother, 15M, who attends the same school as me. One of the popular jocks in his pe class started an ""alpha male"" podcast and its disgusting. I've listened to some of it, and its all ""women are weak and worse then men and that means women should be banned from having jobs exept wife and mother. Men who don't want to eff women aren't really men. Gay people are less then human failures whos mothers were too masculine."" etc etc.

About a month ago, I cought my brother drinking some beer around 1am. he told me he just wanted to see what it was like and that he hated the taste. I made him promise not to drink alcohol again until he was 21, and he agreed. This was in the living room where the nannycam is, so i copied the footage onto my personal computer and deleted it from the origanal systems.

About a week ago, my brother told me he wanted to join and was going to try soon. He doesn't listen to podcasts and never believed any of that stuff anyway, so I know he just thinks its something ""cool"" that cool kids do, but its still really harmful for everyone. I told him that, if he joined that podcast, i would show mom the nannycam footage. He would be grounded for at least two months if i told, and we both know it.

he complained but didn't join the podcast. He doesn't seem like he's still slaty and i think he's gotten over it, but I'm starting to feel guilty about doing that. On one hand, I just want him to be okay. Those massages would destroy his self-esteem and i don't want him to suffer like that. On the other, there might've been a better way to go about it while still protecting him.

31,1e110gw,AITA for needing alone time?,"Using a throwaway + fake names. We’re all 17). I just got into a fight with two of my closest friends, “Amber and Emma”. I've known Amber since we were 8 and Emma since 5, I've always been closer with Amber. The past year or so we've been closer than ever, no drama, no other close friends(not that we can't have other friends, but that just usually ends up bad in our friendship).

I hung out with Amber and Emma after school one day and it was now later than I wanted to be out, but I said I’d stay the night at Amber's. The first plan was to bring me home so I could pack then Amber picks me up later and l'd stay the night. Like usual things came up and we ran around, now Amber was asking why I needed so long to do things.

I never tell Amber my issues because she never understands them and downplays my emotions. Everyone I know usually is like this so I'm used to it, but it's just a thing I know happens. When Amber has a problem, I ditch everything no matter how I'm feeling, and rush to her house. But, whenever I'm sad l like to be home because if I hung out with her while sad she'd say ""what's your problem, you're being quiet?"", and I don't need to fake happiness when I'm actually feeling down, especially with my best friend.

Back to the hangout, I kept saying I had chores and things to do, they said they could watch as I do them which is awkward and feels rude. I don't want to do laundry for hours while making them sit and watch me run around. Eventually Amber drove me home, I said I’d say if I finished things early. I never did because when I have the urge to be home I never really am finished with everything. I always can find something to do. 

Days later they start bashing me in a group chat. I nicely explain how I felt they're a bit rude sometimes and don't understand me well. They kept changing subjects and saying I was arguing and asking ""do all these years of our friendship mean nothing to you?"". Which in the end, no, the years don't really matter if they can't maturely accept that l'm not always in the mood to go out. Unlike them, I’d rather be home than out 24/7. 

In the end they both left the group chat which felt like a win. During the convo they made thing about them. It's hard because Emma helps me with problems, Amber has just always made me hate her somehow. But since Emma was with Amber, they teamed up. I don't have anyone asking to hangout now, but I also don't have to be with people when I don't want to which is nice. I've gone many times not being friends with Emma, but I always go back to Amber. After 9 years it’s weird to be done with her and setting boundaries. They haven't said anything to me except for Emma snapping me, and her and Amber laughing into the camera (laughing at me). I really couldn't care less. I'm working on my future and planning many things. Amber and Emma can't wait to see me fail but I'm glad to say that won't be happening any time soon.

I went to my guidance counselor (who brought me to the principal) and explained what happened and that I didn’t care what she said about me in private but that 1.

University was by no means easy for me due to the cultural shock of moving from a small town to a big city, the first time it basically went all to waste as i sank into a deep depression that led to some anxiety and anger issues (don't feel sorry for me, i should have known better, most of the factors that led to that were entirely under my control, i just let it spiral) but then after moving to study abroad i managed to graduate with mediocre grades.

Now with a fresh degree i started working at the clinic , thinking i was doing quite well for some time, some asshole patients here and there but almost all people were expressing a positive opinion about me.

Well.

Turns out I was hurting a non-negligible amount of them while doing anesthesia , root canals, cavities and the like and many got scared off by that and my small outbursts of anger whenever some material or machine stopped working, it didn't happen everytime such thing happened, and it was never directed at the patient, but it still left a sour impression, thus the clinic hemorraged patients while i was kept in the dark from it all, thinking i was doing well.

A stellar job with some minor hiccup along the way.

I was so wrong.

The worst part is that the dental assistants knew it all and kept the information from me, preventing any chance of improvement until now out of fear of retribution from my father.

And here's the final straw: My father invested a lot in this clinic recently to accomodate both me and my sister, who also studied dentistry, and now we face bankrupcy if we don't get enough clients by the end of the year.

Now that it has all come to light my father wants to downgrade me to basically be a dental assistant/hygienist for the foreseeable future, but it's a decision that breaks my heart just as much as the realization i was such an idiot.

38,1e102s8,AITA for disagreeing with my roommate on his rule on visitors? ,"My roommate (23m) and I (23m) have been living together for the better part of a year. We have also been friends for accumulatively about 4 years. Honestly, living together has gone pretty smoothly. We both have our things to work on of course: personally, I could be more cleanly, or just clean more in general (although I keep my actual mess confined to my room). Recently, though, we had an argument and I’m not sure where to go with it. 

For context, we’ve had a pretty simple rule in which if one of us wants the living room for some private time (mainly with a partner or date), we ask the other if that’d be okay. This never caused any real issues in the past. At worst, sometimes I would want to spend some of my night on the couch, but then he would ask if he and his girlfriend could have the room. As a non-confrontational person, I never really argued it because it wasn’t a big deal. But a few weeks ago, I asked if a girl I had started going on dates with - who had been to the house a couple times - could come over in a few hours to watch a movie. He asked if it was okay if she didn’t, to which I said okay. But he then asked if I could give him at least a day’s notice before having someone over. This irked me a little bit as it felt slightly controlling, but also didn’t feel like it would affect me that much, so I agreed. 

Later that night, I was on a drive talking to my girlfriend, and we both really wanted to watch a movie, so I decided to let my roommate know we’d just be hanging out in my room. Long story short, he got upset because he claimed I agreed not to have anyone over, and that he didn’t appreciate me having someone over when he has work in the morning (so did I); I responded by saying I agreed not to have someone over in the common area, and that he a) doesn’t have any say over who I have in my room, and b) it shouldn’t matter since we’d be in my room and he could go about whatever his routine was that night. Not to mention that he didn’t ever ask permission to have his girlfriend over in general, and she would sometimes come over even when he was at work. This never bothered me, but to me the principle stands. 

That was all through text, so we had a face-to-face discussion the next day, which got heated over mainly whether my room constitutes a “shared space”; it’s important to reiterate that this wasn’t some stranger. We agreed not to bring strangers over, but to me, this had nothing to do with our agreement since I never would’ve imagined he thought he could make a decision over having a girl I’m seeing over to my private space. Honestly, I’m just wondering if I’m in the wrong since we’ve barely spoken since then.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-11,"AITA for disagreeing with my roommate on his rule on visitors?  My roommate (23m) and I (23m) have been living together for the better part of a year. We have also been friends for accumulatively about 4 years. Honestly, living together has gone pretty smoothly. We both have our things to work on of course: personally, I could be more cleanly, or just clean more in general (although I keep my actual mess confined to my room). Recently, though, we had an argument and I’m not sure where to go with it. 

For context, we’ve had a pretty simple rule in which if one of us wants the living room for some private time (mainly with a partner or date), we ask the other if that’d be okay. This never caused any real issues in the past. At worst, sometimes I would want to spend some of my night on the couch, but then he would ask if he and his girlfriend could have the room. As a non-confrontational person, I never really argued it because it wasn’t a big deal. But a few weeks ago, I asked if a girl I had started going on dates with - who had been to the house a couple times - could come over in a few hours to watch a movie. He asked if it was okay if she didn’t, to which I said okay. But he then asked if I could give him at least a day’s notice before having someone over. This irked me a little bit as it felt slightly controlling, but also didn’t feel like it would affect me that much, so I agreed.

40,1e0zqg7,WIBTA if I told my roommate's girlfriend to stop putting my eggs in the fridge again?,"I currently live with 4 roommates. Last week, one of my roommates (Megan) invited her girlfriend (Julie) to stay over at our house for about a week. Julie is very sweet and I had absolutely no issue with her staying, and neither did anyone else in the house. The same day that Julie arrived, I noticed that we were out of eggs since they weren't on the counter where they usually are. I just assumed we were out and I was planning on buying more. While I was cooking that night, I opened the fridge and saw all of the eggs sitting inside of the fridge. I asked out loud why they were in the fridge, and Julie spoke up and said that eggs are meant to be kept in the fridge. I explained to her that I have never, in my entire life, refrigerated my eggs.

My mom moved to the US when she was 19, and my dad moved to the US when he was 8 with his parents. They're both immigrants. My parents love eggs and so do I, so we would have them all of them time, and they were never once refrigerated. They just kept them in the pantry until they were eaten. Sometimes we would have up to 4-5 cartons of eggs just sitting in the pantry, and none of us ever got sick or had any issue with rotten/spoiled eggs. For reference, they would buy their eggs from Publix or Costco.

Julie seemed really surprised about what I said, and she explained that since eggs are washed in the US, its bad to keep eggs unrefrigerated for longer than 2-3 hours. I told her I understood what she was saying, but that I prefer to keep them on the counter, especially since I bought the eggs. I was the only one who ever ate eggs, and we only have them because of me. So, I took them out of the fridge.

I thought that it, but the next day I noticed the eggs were back in the fridge. So I asked again, and Megan mentioned that Julie just felt better having them in the fridge. I told her that they were my eggs, in my house, and Id like them to stay out. But every single day, for 6 days straight, I would find the eggs in the fridge. I had communicated multiple times that it bothers me. I talked to my other two roommates, and they agree that its my decision since I'll be eating them. At this point I genuinely feel like I can't/shouldn't say anything since Julie leaves today, but it really bothered me.

I didn't like that Megan allowed Julie to move many things around our house (including eggs, dishes, appliances, and a few other things) without asking. She would do this nearly every day. I tried to be nice to Julie because I didn't want to argue. I did address it a few times and she ignored it, dismissed it, and then continued the behavior. Julie and Megan are in a serious long-term relationship, so I know she will be back to visit, which is why I want to tell her to stop. I just don't want to upset anyone or cause tension for something stupid.

So... WIBTA if I told my roommate's girlfriend to stop putting my eggs in the fridge again?

Edit: Just wanted to clarify some stuff to help out here. Its not so much the issue of me ""being right"" about the eggs. I know its weird, I know its unusual, but its what I want to do with my food that I eat. Yes, I do buy my eggs at the grocery store. Yes, I am assuming that risk. And, she is right with that. I wont deny that she's right about keeping them refrigerated because Ive done my research about this. The issue is more the fact that she wants to be ""right"" and move our things around simply because she believes that the way that she does this is superior. Its more about the underlying issue that she does not live here, Ive communicated that it bothers me, and shes choosing to do the opposite by trying to make me change how I live. 

Aditional info: Our fridge unfortunately doesnt have the greatest temperature settings (its really shitty) and because its so cold, it actually freezes the eggs and after doing some research on that... frozen eggs are actually worse than warm ones. Id rather keep them on the counter because I dont want to have to defrost my eggs everyday. And yes, we have tried turning the temperature down, but unfortunately it doesnt keep the rest of our food cold enough to not spoil. Its military housing and it has the WORST temperature settings.

Edit #2: Genuinely did not expect this to blow up since I thought it would end up being a silly little question that would be overlooked. Thank you for all of your comments, and believe me I am now more than ever well aware of the health risks and hazards. I appreciate the concern for my health, but more importantly, for my roommates. As I mentioned below, I plan on investing in my own mini fridge to put the eggs into to fix the temperature issue. Until then, I'm gonna keep the eggs in a seperate space and away from other food in the communal area. I already keep them in a sealed container, and I'll continue to do that. And yes, we do clean our counters after everytime we cook. I also immediately clean up any bits of egg that might have spilled, and I do immediately clean the dishes that might also have raw eggs on them. I plan on speaking to Megan about her girlfriend's behavior and setting up much better guidelines and boundaries for the next time anyone visits our home. I might update depending on how that goes, but thank you all for your supportive (and not so supportive) comments!

43,1e0z4vh,"AITA, I didn’t invite my father to my toddler’s birthday party and now he is threatening consequences.","A little background to this story, my father and mother got into a messy divorce and are not on speaking terms. I’m a married adult, with young children, and own a home. This home is not particularly close to my dad’s house. My dad has since remarried, although I did not attend the wedding.

Now my son’s birthday was coming up and he said he wanted a birthday party. I don’t know why but for some reason I wasn’t expecting a 3 year old to want a birthday party, so maybe IATA. So I quickly invited some of my son’s friends and my mother, since she lived closer and I knew she could make it on short notice. It was a fun party and my son had a great time. I took pictures and posted them to social media when it was all over.

Then came the text. I won’t post it here since it’s rather lengthy but the gist of it is: you don’t invite me to family gatherings, you disrespected me by not coming to my wedding, your mother has poisoned you against me, I won’t be treated like this for much longer, there will be consequences!

I was confused at first, I had just seen him last month at a small family gathering with his side of the family. I tried to explain that I couldn’t have him and my mom over at the same time since my mom would just leave and I didn’t need that drama at my son’s birthday party. I offered to let him come over and give my son a gift on another day if he would like. As for his wedding, I told him I didn’t feel comfortable going. It was just weird for me and nothing personal. I told him I didn’t appreciate the whole “consequences” talk. After all I’m the only child he has left that even speaks to him.

On a side note, and I did not say this to my dad, but I’m not even sure what consequences would be. I’m a self made man at this point in my life. It sounds cruel to say, but I don’t really need my parents for anything any more. I suppose he could write me out of his will but I’ve always assumed I wouldn’t get anything. I’d be lucky if I didn’t inherit debt at this point.

Anyways, to make a long story short, I basically said he has to deal with the fact that he can’t be over at the house at the same time as my mom. If he wants that to change he needs to make things civil with my mom. Until then, he has to accept coming over for separate family gatherings. He took this as me taking sides and we just went around in circles for a long time, with claiming all his previously stated positions.

I’m tempted to just do what my siblings have done and cut him out of my life but at the same time I want him to be able to have some kind of relationship with his grandchildren. 

So, AITA for having two birthday parties for my son, just to appease a parent that doesn’t even appreciate the extra effort? I don’t think I can keep doing this forever. I think my kids don’t care now but I would think they would resent this as they get older.

44,1e0z2ea,AITA for leaving sticks out in the yard?,"I (33M) recently moved into a great little place that shares a yard with three other condo units. Yesterday, I got this email from my disabled neighbor about sticks left in the yard.

""Hi,

I appreciate that you and ""Dog's Name"" love to play with the sticks out in the backyard, however, the number and thickness of sticks left in the yard after your play time has been steadily increasing and the fact that the sticks are left all over the yard after you finish playing has become a hazard.

Last night when I took ""Her Dog's Name"" out to go potty, my crutch landed on a stick that was not visible even with my flashlight and it caused my crutch to roll and that caused me to fall. I twisted my good knee and hurt my shoulder in the fall. It is imperative that I be able to safely transverse the yard with ""Her Dog's Name"". This cannot happen again.

Additionally, the lawn company that provides our service has told me they want the sticks removed because they present a danger. the larger sticks can damage their equipment and the smaller pieces can become projectiles. The last time they mowed they had to stop several times and remove the sticks, and they were not happy about that. As they stated, they are paid to mow and edge the lawn not to move and/or remove hoses, sprinklers, sticks or other debris.

I negotiated a great deal with the lawn company to mow and edge our huge lawn. They have been providing their service for the 6 1/2 years I have been managing the upkeep of the lawn for the landlord and I do not want to risk losing their services Going forward, you need to pick up the sticks you and ""Dog's Name"" play from the yard and keep them by your door after each play session. We are fortunate to have such a beautiful yard to enjoy and to play in with our dogs and we all need to be respectful and keep the yard clean of sticks and other debris.""

End of email.

Obviously, I'm more than happy to keep any sticks we play with by the door. However, there are only 4-5 sticks that we use and my dog has been steadily chewing them down rather than the sticks ""increasing in thickness"".  All of the sticks we play with have been sourced from the yard itself. Every yard I've lived in has had a number of twigs, branches, and sticks that fall into it and I feel like I'm being held responsible for things that are out of my control. AITA? WIBTA if I wrote a kind email explaining my point? I want to tread carefully since she has been here for so long but I don't want to get stuck picking up every fallen stick/branch or be liable in case she falls again.

Happy to provide a screenshot of the email but I think that may be against the rules. Thank you for your time!

Edit: Fair enough, I'm TA! There was no question about picking up the sticks, but another email would be unnecessary. Thanks for your replies!

2nd Edit: The reason I didn't pick up those sticks before my neighbor's email was because our yard had countless other sticks present in it already. We live in an incredibly windy area that sometimes get triple digit gusts and I don't want to be blamed the next time it gets windy and a stick falls from a tree. In a conversation with another neighbor, she does agree that there is no increase in the usual amount of sticks in the yard. [https://imgur.com/a/WjjX1k7](https://imgur.com/a/WjjX1k7)

They have been providing their service for the 6 1/2 years I have been managing the upkeep of the lawn for the landlord and I do not want to risk losing their services Going forward, you need to pick up the sticks you and ""Dog's Name"" play from the yard and keep them by your door after each play session. We are fortunate to have such a beautiful yard to enjoy and to play in with our dogs and we all need to be respectful and keep the yard clean of sticks and other debris.""

End of email.

Obviously, I'm more than happy to keep any sticks we play with by the door. However, there are only 4-5 sticks that we use and my dog has been steadily chewing them down rather than the sticks ""increasing in thickness"".  All of the sticks we play with have been sourced from the yard itself. Every yard I've lived in has had a number of twigs, branches, and sticks that fall into it and I feel like I'm being held responsible for things that are out of my control. AITA? WIBTA if I wrote a kind email explaining my point? I want to tread carefully since she has been here for so long but I don't want to get stuck picking up every fallen stick/branch or be liable in case she falls again.

Happy to provide a screenshot of the email but I think that may be against the rules. Thank you for your time!

Edit: Fair enough, I'm TA! There was no question about picking up the sticks, but another email would be unnecessary. Thanks for your replies!

2nd Edit: The reason I didn't pick up those sticks before my neighbor's email was because our yard had countless other sticks present in it already. We live in an incredibly windy area that sometimes get triple digit gusts and I don't want to be blamed the next time it gets windy and a stick falls from a tree. In a conversation with another neighbor, she does agree that there is no increase in the usual amount of sticks in the yard. [https://imgur.com/a/WjjX1k7](https://imgur.com/a/WjjX1k7) 

Regardless, the sticks were picked up and we will switch to other toys that will be kept by our door.",1.0,1.0649878978729248,1,1

We are colleagues and were looking for places to live together. I originally found the place and made initial contact with the landlord. Things were great until I started to get close to RM's arch-nemesis... I cannot even mention the third ""toxic"" friend without RM throwing a tantrum. They did not get along due to communication issues on both sides. We talked a lot about our lifestyles and thought we would be fine as I overcommunicate.

We were good...even when we've been out of power for over a week... Until it wasn’t. We had just left for work when I forgot something and went back for it. This placed RM in an uncomfortable situation that RM was supposedly trying to tell me. RM was carrying a lot and I felt bad holding RM back so I told RM to go and we would meet up later. We usually have trouble deciding what to do (what movie to watch, etc) so I thought it would be good to take the initiative instead of deliberating in the dang heat. RM was upset because I didn't hear what RM was trying to say even though I waited for what I thought was a confirmation before leaving. RM waited for me and then we walked to the bus stop together... in silence... on opposite sides of the road.

2 days later, we're at a bus transfer station. RM was frustrated that I stopped and talked to a colleague and didn't know if we were headed home together/didn’t know which bus I was deciding to take. I noticed RM looking confused so I pointed to the bus I was taking. RM came over still frustrated and (I don't remember RM saying anything) I told RM that RM could go and I would meet RM at home. Apparently, RM was asking a question with two options and since I did not answer with one of the options, RM was upset. I think RM is very dependent. RM won't admit this and would instead throw a hissy fit when I get sidetracked with a work conversation. We never discussed that we would always go to/from home together. To me, it is a matter of convenience.

After getting off the bus I asked if RM wants to talk. We start discussing what happened in the entire way home and later that night. I feel better after our second conversation but RM is still thinking about it and will come to me with any other thoughts on the subject and hasn't so far.

RM seems super toxic and is a child when it comes to personal awareness. My BF comes soon and we will be staying elsewhere. If I like the other place, I am considering staying permanently. However, I would honestly like to stay at the place I am currently living and don't want to stiff the landlord.

Ever since I have met her she has made me very uncomfortable, I have given her multiple chances (probably more than I should have) and now I do not even wish to talk to her or see her, she ruins my mood every time I see her. The very first time we met, we were at a restaurant. She waited until he went to the bathroom, and said to me ""In case you were wondering, we have never slept together.""

We went on vacation with her once in Vegas, (to which she lied about bringing a friend with her- ended up coming alone and making it a third wheel situation) in the hotel she started talking about her boob tape on her outfit, and proceeded to flash us her boobs to show us which I thought was completely inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. On the same trip, she also kept insisting that my fiancee was burning from the sun and that she should rub sunscreen on him. He kept saying he was okay without, she kept insisting he needed it, even though I was there and completely capable of putting it on him or he could put it on himself.
Another instance is she has sent us snap chats at the same time, so I know she sent him a bikini picture. She has made comments about scking guys dcks and making them c*m quick in front of us both.

48,1e0yo58,AITA for calling my cousin by a pet name even though it makes his fiancé uncomfortable?,"I (32F) have always been close with my huge immediate and extended family. I have 35 cousins and we never have any family drama, even the in-laws get along with each other. My immediate family is very close to one of my uncles and his family since we grew up 2 hours away from each other. My cousin (22M), the youngest of this family, has always been like a son to me. I met him when he was about 6 months old and I was 10 years old. I’ve watched him grow up from infancy and I love him a lot. 

A couple months ago, this cousin got engaged to his high school sweetheart (21F). I was excited for him and happy he found someone so early in life. I recently met her for the first time at a gathering for my mom’s birthday. She seemed pretty sweet and we got along until I called my cousin by a “pet name”. My cousin’s name ends with an “ee” sound (ex. Johnny). So I started calling him by his name + “baby” (ex. Johnny Baby) while he was still a baby and the name stuck. When his gf heard this she seemed a bit put off, I didn’t really think anything of it. By the end of the night, she was very quiet and obviously bothered. 

Fast forward, I’m talking to my other cousin (his sister), and she lets it slip that his fiance was “weirded out” by my behavior. She said that calling him “baby”, hugging him, and some of the others things I said were “too far for a cousin”. I thought this was ridiculous because I’m 10 years older than them, I have a boyfriend for whom this has never been an issue, and I’m not the only one who calls him that name. I would understand if I was his friend, but we’re family. I told her that I’m going to talk to my cousin however I want, and I’m sure that news has probably made it back to the fiance by now. The next time I saw her she pretty much avoided me the whole time.  

In my defense, we have a lot of things that are normal in our family/culture that seem weird to others. For example, we call our parents “mommy” and “daddy” into adulthood. I also don’t get why she is upset with me personally when our entire family + his parents say it. In her defense, my personality can be a bit over the top sometimes and I probably baby him the most out of my siblings.

I’m a bit torn because on one hand, I obviously want my cousin’s future wife to like me. On the other hand, I feel like I shouldn’t have to change the way we interact with in our family just for her. I’ve asked friends and they’re pretty much split on the issue. Am I the asshole? 

Edit: Additional info, I am 100% certain my cousin has always been totally okay with the nickname. We use it sparingly and for jokes only, that night I think I only said it once or twice. I also have a few weird/embarrassing nicknames that he still calls me when we joke around. 

I did send him a text asking if his fiance is upset with me. He told me that she wasn’t upset, which confused me. I then told him that if he ever has a problem with me or anyone, he can tell me no judgement. He told me we’re good.

52,1e0xprk,AITA for raising my voice at a teacher at my former highschool?,"I graduated from my high school in 2021, and since I study music, I went back to my high school every summer to help rehearse the pit orchestra for the graduation.

The school has a “no phones” policy. Students can’t bring their phones into classes, and they can’t use it at any point within the school hours.

When I am at my high school I have a badge that says “student volunteer”. They only had two kinds of badges that either say “visitor” or “student volunteer”. Neither fit my description but they decided that “student volunteer” should do. With the badge I get access to the campus during school hours and usually no one will bother me. 

That being said, I look young for my age, having not grown facial hair even at 21. I probably look like your typical fat kid in the junior or senior year.

So I went there this summer (late May) as usual. One day after lunch I had some time to kill due to there not being a music class immediately after lunch that day. I was on my phone in this lounge thing outside of the cafeteria, and soon the confrontation began. 

A teacher whom I don’t know (probably one of the teachers that got hired after I graduated) approaches me with his hands doing a “gimme that” gesture, referring to my phone.

This wasn’t the first time, but most of the times the they will realize I am just a young looking graduate and leave me be, but this time he insists that the badge says “Student Volunteer” and therefore does not prove that I am not a student. He demanded my student ID, which, of course I don’t have one.

“Why are you not in class and on your phone?”

“Sorry but I’m not a student”

“Where’s your excuse slip? If your parents aren’t here you can’t be here”

“OK, but I am only here to help with the orchestra”

This went on and on for quite a bit and it was getting ridiculous, and I started to get very frustrated. I did the unthinkable, I looked at his badge which says his first and last name, and calls him by his first name. (Hey, I’m technically your coworker!)

“Look, [FIRST NAME], you can go ask anyone at the front office about me. I’m not giving you my phone, that’s ridiculous. Have a nice day.”

He seemed furious, he shrugs and went

“Ok [MY NAME], you can stop that, I will report this to Mr. [VICE PRINCIPAL].”

I was so done with that situation by that time, I grabbed my backpack and left. I could hear him say “Really?” behind me. 

I brought this up with another teacher who kept in touch, and she explains to me that, there apparently has been incidents where students steal the badges and sneak out, and that may be why he was giving me a hard time.

I’m not sure if the teacher ended up “reporting” me. I cringe a little when I think of this incident because I barely ever raised my voice ever. Nothing gets me more frustrated than to be accused of something I am not guilty of, and pretty much every time I had a real argument with someone, it was because of this.

53,1e0x79y,AITA for asking my friend to take down her bachelorette party photos? ,"To start this off I am a muslim woman who wears the hijab. I cover my hair and most of my body. I do not judge those who don't do the same, nor do I try to impose my beliefs onto others. Everyone will have their own personal journeys, and just as I know I'm not perfect, I can't judge others for it either. 

I (23F) recently went to a friends bachelorette party. Women only, no drinks, just girls being girls and celebrating a friends soon to be marriage. Maya (24F) has been a friend of mine since kindergarten and I'm more than happy to be a part of such a big part of her life. She isn't religious, but she accepts my views and even going to let me wear a more modest style abaya as her maid of honour. This is to say Maya understands the hijab and what it means to me, or so I thought.

At the party, I took it off as it was just women. We were going to sleep over anyways so I don't think anyone was expecting me to sleep in the thing. I always find it funny how they react when they get to see my hair, like I'm secretly Repunzel or something. We watched a movie, took photos and videos, and generally had a good time. I had no problems with the photos being taken, since my friends are usually respectful and don't post them anywhere. It just stays in our groupchat. We went to sleep and the next day everything was normal. We cleaned up and I drove home, finally checking my phone. 

I opened instagram to the tagged icon and checked it to see myself and the girls on Mayas public account. I quickly messaged Maya asking her to take it down before anyone else saw, as I couldn't control whether or not some guy was going to see her post, and she refused saying that there were no other good photos of her. I asked her to simply crop me out or even draw over my hair and neck but she said that it would look wrong and that I'm overreacting. I insisted I wasn't and that she knew that I couldn't show my hair to just anyone. Instead of responding to me, she took it to the groupchat as some sort of ""counsel"". Half of them agreed that she shouldn't have posted a photo of me without my hijab and a couple others told me I was overreacting and no one cared besides me. I should note that one of the most vocal of them who disagreed generally doesn't like me so she would have disagreed regardless of what I said. 

Most of us ar urging her to take down the post, and now she's claiming we're putting her under a lot of stress with the wedding only a week away, but I don't see what that has to do with this. Am I really being unreasonable for wanting to be respected? AITA?

Edit: There were about 40 photos and I was only in 6 of them. People are under the impression that I was in every photo taken. I wasnt, yet I was in almost half of which were posted.

Apart from that initial incident at the airport and a couple of shouts at me the holiday was amazing. My brother was extremely nice and I was actually able to have conversations with him.

Since then I have made myself available to help her out with follow up doctor and being at her house to help out. I have cancelled things for my 3.5 yo son in order to be there.

My dad called me and was asking if I would be able to make myself available to take her in the mornings while he had to work. I told him I already have plans for the summer with my son and I don't want to cancel everything for him. I am able to move some things but some are firm and me and my son have been looking forward to this.
I told my dad I am able to help out in the afternoons though, this was unacceptable because my mother would rather the morning. This caused a fight and I am being made out to be a bad daughter.

""I have no issues helping you and mom out, and I've been taking her to the doctor and cancelling things to be home when you couldn't. I am able to help bring her to PT in the afternoon but I am not going to be sacrificing my sons summer for moms preference of PT in the morning. I am willing to help but that also means working around our schedule since we are the ones going out of our way. I'm one person with a toddler. I feel so unappreciated.""

From dad:
""Your not unappreciated it's just your the one home just like moms for you. So if you can work it out that would be awesome.i can't just take off work just like your *husband name* can't""

57,1e0w2cu,AITA for not cooking for my friend even if I promised ?,"
Hello

I have a friend which I get along very well and also consider as one of my best friends.

Six weeks ago it was his birthday and I suggested to cook something at my house, instead of going to a restaurant because my boyfriend was working until 8 pm , so it would be long until we get our food.

A few days later he asked to report this on an other day because one of his affairs wanted to meet him.

Three days before the new date he asked me if it was possible to come a few hours earlier because he accidentally said yes to his friend for going to a party.
He forgot that it was also the day he was invited to my house.
I was not happy about this because he already canceled the first time.
I told him so and he answered that I never told him that I wanted to cook something and I told him that I said it many times and even texted about it.

Then he told that he would come to eat at my house and cancel the menu on the party, and go after eating at my house to the event.

My boyfriend got very angry about this when I told him about all this.
He made it clear that I shouldn’t cook something for him because I already cooked a lot for him even though he rarely invites me or asks me to spend time together.
And also the preparing and the cooking itself takes more time than he is actually willing to spend with me.

When he arrived on that evening I didn’t cooked for him but suggested to order some food from a restaurant.

At this moment he already seemed mad because the food that we were ordering was took long, and he was arriving late to his party.

After this he told me that he didn’t like the fact that I haven’t cooked something as promised.
We had a discussion due to this.

He doesn’t wants to attend my birthday party until I cook something as promised.
Should I cook on an other day or let him be mad?

Actual story: My mom has gone down the road of just telling me straight to do stuff or I'm a terrible son.

I understand that doing jobs around the house is like paying rent (I have no job or money) but all I want is for her to just ask me instead of telling me what to do like I'm not a person.

Cut to now and I'm still trying to set that boundary and she doesn't care. She is now doing literally everything herself just to avoid asking me politely to do something like mowing the lawn. I just want to be treated like a person, in my eyes I don't see it being that bad, but to you all on reddit... AITA?

Edit: I have been getting a lot of comments saying for me to get a job, so let me add a bit more detail:

My job search is reluctant and slow because of my fear of the work industry. I've seen r/Antiwork and I personally don't want to deal with the assholes (mainly the managers and customers) that ruined it.

60,1e0vp8r,WIBTA if I (f24) let my best friend/roommate (f30) pay for a repair she says I’ve caused? ,"My best friend and I each rented a room in an apartment for a month & moved out a week ago. Unfortunately now the two landlords tried to use the washing machine again and couldn’t open it afterwards + the water didn’t drain. So they hired an electrician that pulled out a sock from behind and want us to pay the 110$ bill.

But I refuse since it’s not clear that I have something to do with it. I’d rather see the bill myself, investigate whose sock it was and look at both our contracts to see if we need to pay. 

My best friend instead says she is the one suffering bc I didn’t pay deposit and she had to pay 150$ for her room which she could lose. Also I can be considered the “guilty” one since I was the last one to use the washing machine. (But it worked back then?) In her opinion it’s impossible to tell who it was so I shouldn’t make a deal out of it and pay. She won’t pick up the bill alone. Either we both pay or we ask the landlords to cover 25% each as well.

My urge is to tell her that it sucks for her but she can also refuse to pay. I won’t pay 30-55$ for something without making 100% sure I really need to. Money is tight right now. On the other hand I understand she doesn’t want to cause stress and if I don’t pay she might not want to live with me again in the future.

61,1e0vezc,AITAH for telling my mom god isn’t the one responsible for my academiacal success?,"A few days ago my mom (50f) asked me (19f) to come to church with her on sunday. I am an atheist but my mom is religious, and sometimes asks me to come to church with her, especially on special occasions like christmas, dead relatives birthdays/death anniversaries etc. 

This time it was my late grandma's birthday, I loved her very much so out of respect towards her I agreed. Than my mom told me that we would also be thanking god and praying for me getting into university.

This was what pissed me off. God wasn't the one who got me into school, I was. I busted my ass off for four years in high school, I got perfect grades, nearly all A's except for one or two Bs on every single report. I passed my graduation exams with all As, and was told by the teachers I was one of the best students in the recent years. I won multiple competitions, placing in nation-wide ranks. 

All of that was something I worked my ass off for. I studied hard, took extracurriculars and extra classes etc. And now I am supposed to just pretend it was all some random guy sitting on a cloud in the sky? Hell no.

So I told my mom: ""Mom, I worked my ass off for four years, I was the one who spent hours studying, practising, taking extra classes and winning competitions. I got myself into uni, not god. I am going to pray for granny, but not for the success I achieved on my own."" she got extremely mad at me and refused to talk to me for literal days so AITAH?

62,1e0vbzk,WIBTA 21st Birthday celebration,"Hello, this is more of a will I be the asshole kind of post. 

   For some background, I (20F) have had a best friend (21F) since we were little. We’ve had ups and downs, the same friend group growing up, and eventually it became just us out of the group that stuck together. We moved into an apartment a few years ago and before that lived with each other in the same bedroom for a year. Basically we have been very close for a long time, and had a great friendship. Best friend and I became fond of alcohol ( as young adults in their first apartment usually do) and unfortunately she has not been able to stop since. About a year ago, she had a medical emergency which was super traumatizing for me to find her that way, resulting in me moving back home and getting my life and mental health together. This unfortunately resulted in us growing apart a bit, and not being as close as we are due to her still drinking and becoming an alcoholic. Note: I only drink socially every once in a while and try to focus on health/ fitness and education more which has somehow also brought us apart due to not sharing the same interests anymore. 

    Now that you have the background, my 21st birthday is coming up in September. However best friend is currently in a rehabilitation center for a month trying to better herself from her alcohol addiction. She is out at the end of this month, and I want to invite her to my birthday so she doesn’t feel left out, but obviously there will be alcohol since it is my 21st. I constantly try to please everyone around me, as well as involve everyone but I’m not sure how. I plan on getting an airbnb and having a party with family, then later going out barhopping and clubbing which I don’t want to bring around someone fragile to alcohol. 

    I truly do not want to enable her or be the reason she starts to drink again, but I just know if I don’t invite her she will feel a certain way. I love my best friend, and am incredibly proud of her for bettering herself, I just want to experience the 21st birthday shenanigans without having to be responsible for another adult.

63,1e0v8qu,AITA for asking someone to stop parking next to my house,"I rent a house that has parking on three sides. On two sides, the parking is shared with the neighboring business (owned by my landlord). On the other side there is a business across the road.

I have tried parking my cars there, he just pulls in after I leave, I have left road cones in the spots, he moves them.

Today I had enough. I walked into the business and asked the woman behind the counter if she knew whose truck was parked in my parking spot. In a huff, she went into the back of the store, so I walked back home. On my way out, I saw her talking to a guy and pointing at me. I had to pass them to get back to my place, so I told him ""I have seven kids, four of whom drive and w-"". I didn't get to finish as he walked away from me.

My question is this, there was room on that side for my cars and his, but someone parking so close to my front door, basically IN my yard made me uncomfortable.

65,1e0v01m,AITA for talking behind my friend's back?,"Hello, I(15F) have recently faced some conflict with a friend(15F). The whole thing is an absolutely complex mess and would probably take a long, long time to unpack, I might post about it in r/relationships or r/relationship_advice .

The main people here are me, Mary, John, and Anna, but there are three other friends in the group as well.

So this year we noticed that Mary was becoming more distant from us, as something was clearly bothering her but she would always defer when asked. This happened from the absolute beginning of the school year, almost every day- We checked in with her and she would always defer, making our worries for her pile up.

About one month ago, she was distant from us to the point that it was extremely concerning(she had indications of severe exhaustion and seemed mentally burnt out). All the concern that built up for me just kind of exploded then. I consulted John, who was very worried as well, and we both agreed to support her the best we could.

We finished our school year a few weeks ago. There was a bit of tension during summer over another matter, and this happened after she and I finished dealing with that.

As I noticed she was once again being closed off towards me, I asked her about her reluctance to open up to us and I would greatly appreciate it if she could share what was bothering her.

The contents of the long reply are something I'll have to unpack separately, but the main incident that continuously emerged in the text was that she found out I was ""talking behind her back, saying that she was the ""distant"" friend"". That made her very angry at me and lose all her trust in me, so she never even thought about opening up.

I broke down and cried after finishing the text, and spent that night awake thinking about what I did wrong. However, I recalled that I never negatively discussed her demeanor(just my concerns for her well-being) and that I only spoke to John, who was equally worried about her.

On a call with Anna, who moved away, I found out that Mary had told her that ""John told me that OP was talking behind my back"". I knew John would never do that, and Anna was confused about it as well, so I called him later. I asked him about this and got the following answer:

He only told Mary that he and I were concerned for her well-being and wanted to find a way to help her. He said, very clearly, that he also did not describe her or me in any negative way and he just expressed his concern for her in a call.

I felt horrible and inconsiderate at first, but after this, I'm mad at her for misinterpreting concern as 'talking behind her back', apparently losing all trust she had in me for this misinterpretation, and sharing this misinformation to our other friend as well. But then I'm also mad at myself for being mad at her because I feel like a bad person.

67,1e0u8c6,AITA for not going to my cousins wedding,"AITA for not going to my cousins wedding because kids aren't invited AND i didn't get a plus one? 

UPDATED: Thanks everyone for the feedback, definitely not trying to sound entitled- just confused because of the difference of how the save the date and invite came (can't believe I forgot to include that!).  I'm almost positive (99.8%) the save the date said my name plus family - which is why I figured it would be my kids and my boyfriend on the actual invite.  Some of my family (parents, brother, and one aunt/uncle) have met him, I just thought it would be fun for him to meet all my cousins as we don't get together often.

My cousin (I'll call her April to make this a little easier) is getting married in about 6 weeks, her brother (I'll call him Bob) got married last summer. 
Save the dates were sent out well in advance for April's wedding (I want to say it was around the holidays that I got it and I believe it said my name & family) so I put it on the calendar and was planning on going.  
Got the invite to her 3 day event (welcome party fri/ceremony&reception sat/tubing down a river sun); only my name was on it and they only gave 2 weeks to rsvp. 
For background info, when Bob got married last summer I did have a plus one, and I brought my oldest daughter because she was 16 and really wanted to see April and Bob, I did check with my mom, aunt and the bride to make sure this was ok as my daughters name was not on the invite specifically- they just didn't want young kids as some cousins have babies.
I see there is something on their wedding website about not having kids at the reception(did a bit of a deep dive today looking for the hotel info, it was in the q&a page, not on the main page or details page about location), but not mentioned on the save the date or by my aunt when I just saw her a few weeks ago for my brothers bridal shower and we did discuss the wedding for a few mins and how excited everyone is for Aprils big day. 
The hotels they saved a block at are 20+ minutes away(only thing closer is a campground) and while they'll be doing a shuttle to the reception, the hotels are $200+ a night with a 2 night minimum stay, so even if I'm not going to the Friday part of the event, I still have to pay for 2 nights at an expensive hotel that is 5 hours from home and can either bring my kids and they sit alone in the hotel all night or leave them home (one is 17, one is 10 - so old enough to be alone for a few hours while i go to the ceremony).  
My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year, have known each other since middle school and are planning on moving in together. I thought it was a little strange that I don't have a plus one to an event that is a multi-day thing especially when I did have a plus one to Bob's wedding. 
I was really looking forward to going to this and bringing him so he could meet my cousins and aunts/uncles, my daughters were looking forward to it also (my older daughter has always loved April, growing up always said ""April is my favorite!"") so it's disappointing for her also not being invited. 
April is closer in age to my daughter than to me, she and Bob were the youngest of our parents kids (my dad and her mom are siblings, and have one other sister)
Also, I would understand not wanting little kids, but my daughter is not the only teen aged cousin (another cousin has a daughter, I'll call her Cheryl, who is exactly a year older than mine and a son who is a few years younger).  
Out of all 8 cousins April & Bob are the only ones without kids, my daughter and Cheryl are the oldest and like I said are closer in age to April & Bob than I am.

UPDATED: Thanks everyone for the feedback, definitely not trying to sound entitled- just confused because of the difference of how the save the date and invite came (can't believe I forgot to include that!).  I'm almost positive (99.8%) the save the date said my name plus family - which is why I figured it would be my kids and my boyfriend on the actual invite.  Some of my family (parents, brother, and one aunt/uncle) have met him, I just thought it would be fun for him to meet all my cousins as we don't get together often.

My cousin (I'll call her April to make this a little easier) is getting married in about 6 weeks, her brother (I'll call him Bob) got married last summer. 
Save the dates were sent out well in advance for April's wedding (I want to say it was around the holidays that I got it and I believe it said my name & family) so I put it on the calendar and was planning on going.

70,1e0u0c7,AITA for not changing my friend's flight?,"I (27M) and some friends decided to take a trip abroad for an event in August, for a long weekend (Friday to Monday), planning everything months in advance. We aimed to book everything at the end of June, ensuring everyone was aware of this through frequent reminders.

On the designated booking day (Friday), everyone was suddenly unavailable, including my friend Zann (27M), who ignored our group messages for over a week and then claimed he was busy without elaboration. Zann asked for a recap after the meeting, to which I told him everything would be in the group chat.

We rescheduled booking for the next day (Saturday) during a group BBQ. Zann didn't show up. I managed to phone him and booked everything, but accidentally listed Zann’s name for a flight he couldn't take as he originally had booked time off with his boss though upon him double checking months later, his boss denied the request and said he needed to be in work on the Monday.

Realizing the mistake, I apologized and tried to change his flight, but found all six tickets were under one booking reference, making individual changes impossible online. I informed Zann we’d need to contact the airline directly on Monday. Come Monday, Zann sent a voice note saying his boss denied his time off, and he insisted I should’ve listened to him. He implied the mistake was on purpose. I apologized again and explained the situation, asked him not to speak to me the way he was and suggested he contact the airline himself with the reference number I provided.

A few days later, Zann apologized, saying he'd contacted the airline via live chat and was told the change had to be made by the booker (me). I explained this was incorrect as I'd already spoken to EasyJet and knew the changes couldn’t be made online. In another outburst he called me a liar and insisted I fix it. I refused, explaining that after his first outburst, I wouldn't help further. I reiterated he needed to call directly instead of going through me. My thinking was that if there's a change fee it's best he pay them direct and know for sure he's fixed his flight instead of paying me to pay them and make more complications.

Despite providing him with the airline’s contact number and explaining that if through to the wrong department they could forward him as needed, Zann continued to deny any accountability and accused me of lying and being rude. He refused to call the airline himself, even though I had already given express permission to EasyJet for him to handle the booking change. Instead of calling he asked another friend to drive him to the airport and spoke to them in person, it is all fixed and he even saved money.

71,1e0tnh0,AITA for telling my friend I was walking her dog as a favor?,"I have been friends with Beth since first grade. We're in our late 30s and have had our ups and downs. I am a very direct, tell-it-how-it-is but laid-back person. She is more emotional. Sometimes, I hurt her feelings with my frankness. I'm more of the person who will tell you the truth if you ask, especially if I have known you for 30 years, but I'm never mean, and I always apologize and try to do better.  I have loved, supported, and valued her as a friend.

Some background.  I am married, have young children, and am in Grad school full-time.  She is recently divorced, no kids.  We live in a very pet-friendly place.  I have worked in the pet care field since I was 14. I am a certified dog trainer.  I used to own a dog training business but recently sold it to my partner in a career change.

Beth has a dog that she is very emotionally invested in.  I get it; however, she is sometimes a little obsessive.  Her dog is reactive and not easy around other dogs or moving vehicles and bikes.  She asked me to walk her dog 3 times a week for half an hour for $15.  I said I was happy to help her within her budget.  For 2 years, I've been working that hour of my time with the drive to her house included in my hectic schedule for her.

Sometimes, she gets upset that I didn't walk her dog for the full 30 minutes, but she also doesn't want me to force her dog to walk if it doesn't want to.  She monitors me through her Ring.  She has also been irritated recently if I'm not there at noon.  I have communicated that I can't commit to being there directly at noon all the time because I have appts or have kid stuff going on.  I always walk the dog before 2pm.

Yesterday she told me she will have someone else walk the dog because she wants it directly at noon.  I said that's fine because it was just a favor I was helping her with, so I'm not offended if she wants to hire someone.  She got super defensive and upset that I would call it a favor.  Maybe she thinks it wasn't a favor because she was compensating me with $15.  We never had a contract, and she just paid me over Venmo  (not always on time, but I didn't worry about it because we're friends).  I told her if I were to charge her what I was worth in the industry, it would be a lot more.  At my company, people would bring me their reactive dogs to walk for 30 minutes for $45.  That works out to $60 per walk with travel time.  (Don't get hung up on prices.  This isn't a debate about that.)  I also told her you get what you pay for.  Experience is worth more.

She is upset with me for saying I was doing her a favor.  I am not at all upset with her paying someone else.  It is her dog, her choice, so I wasn't mean at any point.  She asked, so I told her why I would have charged her more if I hadn't done my friend a favor.  I need an outside perspective because I am sometimes too straightforward and not sensitive enough.

When we cook dinner together she'll get frustrated if I don't do something exactly the way she wants it done or when we play video games together and I make a mistake, anything that involves something she's good at. She even gets frustrated when I can't hear her properly (I have a bit of a hearing problem and she knows it)

Today we got a tv stand that she wanted to help me put together. I was already holding some stuff in because of some other stuff she had done earlier (ex: I put out a bowl filled with water by the sidewalk for any passing animals and when I saw that it was stolen (try to figure that out) instead of saying ""oh I'm sorry that sucks"" or anything the first thing she says is ""well what did you think was going to happen?"" and then later while we were playing a game I almost slipped us up and she sighed and said ""I'm so glad this isn't real life"" despite the fact we had to restart the level twice because of her)

I tried to brush all that off because, hey that's just how she is. But then it's time to put the tv stand together. Normally it wouldn't have taken as long with me working on it by myself, especially since this stand was probably the first simplest thing I've had to put together in a while. But when I was trying to get everything ready and organized (which screws and washers I'd need, the tools, and the pieces of the stand) but it took longer to do so because my roommate kept taking the instruction manual away from me without asking, and even after I finally got everything together I couldn't start because she, again, kept taking the manual away from me.

We finally put it together, now it was time to attach it to the tv. But when I tried to simply get started, she made me stop and take an extra 10 minutes to look over the screws and the back of the tv (the tv stand was bought separately from the tv itself) and, without even bothering to actually try any of the screws the box came with, she was ready to give up and say ""I don't think any of these are going to work"". I asked why she thought that, especially since we hadn't even tried any of the provided screws yet, but she wouldn't give a straight answer. Finally, I just took one of the screws, and just put it into the back of the tv, showing that it, indeed, fit.

my frustration finally showed when she asked for the wrong screw size and snapped at me for giving her the screw she asked for. She told me I was starting to tick her off because of how I was acting and as calmly as I could I told her that handiwork to me was like her working in the kitchen; it's my thing and I do things a certain way and I even apologized for snapping at her. She said I couldn't claim handiwork as my ""domain"" since we use the kitchen every day.

After they started doing that, I immediately changed my mind and kept the ball. They didn’t make any effort to catch the ball and the coach tossed the ball directly to me.

I had every intention to give it to one of the kids that were sitting further down my row ( 10 seats away) but while I was taking my picture, the parents that had the group of kids started yelling “hey there are kids down here” and started chanting “there’s kids down here!” as a means to pressure/shame me into giving them the ball. After they started doing that, I immediately changed my mind and kept the ball. They didn’t make any effort to catch the ball and the coach tossed the ball directly to me. The rest of the game, they were still trying to pressure me into giving up the ball which, in turn, made me want to keep it more. I didn’t want to reward behavior like that. Am I the asshole for keeping it?",0.0,0.008213347755372524,0,1

75,1e0rsrn,AITAH for ignoring my mom after she said I should pray for her death ?,"I 25F live with my parents & I help with rent bills, etc. primarily why I don’t leave so I’ll be of help to them. I also work from home so I can get caught up in my head at times where I want some peace & quiet. 

On Monday evening I went to take a walk around 730pm after having some dinner “fart walks”. On Tuesday I felt like taking a walk again after dinner and my mother shouted at me. She was shouting nonstop saying who goes out at this time why do I have to go. I didn’t interrupt her once while she was ranting and I said okay I will stay home that’s fine. I went to my room and went on my computer and she came in saying don’t mind her and that now I can go. Now it’s 9pm and I told her I don’t want to go anymore. She kept going back & forth saying why don’t I want to go now since she now gave me permission. I finished some work on the computer and I went to take a walk and by than my mom was already asleep. 

While I was outside I saw a guy get ran over by a car it was such a horrific accident the guys face was bleeding nonstop and he wasn’t able to get up. All the cars and nearby individuals that saw stopped to help. I went to help also I felt so terrible seeing such a thing happen right in front of me . I gave the dude water and we waited for the ambulance to come. 

While I was waiting for the ambulance to arrive my mom called me. She not once asked where I am. She simply started yelling and shouting for 8 minutes straight, I didn’t interrupt until she let me speak. Once I told her I came to walk she started calling me all sorts of things. I let her “express” herself more as she wished. I told her you could just called me and say hey where are you . It’s simple as that. 

Now Wednesday, yesterday, I picked my mom up from work and her attitude and energy was disgusting me so I told her I’ll be going out to the library and just relax. I really do get tired of being home all day since working from home can have its cons of when your mother sees you as a child. I decided I don’t want to come home until my brother comes home or she falls sleep because I am tired of the verbal abuse. At 630 pm she called me multiple times and as expected first thing she did was yell and shout at me non stop & I told her what is wrong I told you I am going to the library and I want to relax. She than started crying saying to pick up $10k for her since she’ll
be leaving. She used to pull these moves on me before so she can see a reaction out of me but it doesn’t work anymore I asked her to calm down. 

Nope, telling her to stay calm made it worse she called me back to back until I had to turn my phone off. I started having anxiety to actually go back in the house. I called her back shortly and she said that I should pray for her death. She said I deserve to see her die soon.

Once I got home I didn’t have the money so she started verbally abusing me again.

79,1e0r2yt,AITA for going to this wedding without my family?,"Long time reader, first time poster (25f). Apologies if this is confusing at all, I'm not 100% sure how to explain the situation. Let me know if there are any clarifications I should make.  

So: My family, which consists of my mom, dad and younger sister Emma (24f), has been friends with this other family since my before sister and i were born. The other family consists of two girls, Jay and Luna, who are around my sister and i's age. Ever since all four of us were kids, we would go on vacations to maine and cape cod etc with my mom and the girl's aunt Hilda, who my mom met back in medical school. 

My mom has always been very close with this other family, especially Jay and Luna, while Emma and I have been less close with them in more recent years-I am still on good terms with them, it's been no other reason than just moving away and drifting apart, really. 

In a few months, the older girl from this other family, Jay, is getting married to her longtime partner.

A few weeks ago, I got a call from her telling me that she is really messed up about it and it was a hard decision, but she doesn't feel comfortable inviting Emma to her wedding. Now, my sister has a major problem with alcohol and severe anxiety issues that cause her to lash out at people, and she's been known to disrupt family events in the *very* recent past. Emma's been living with my parents for the past few months and she's been fired from a few jobs because of these issues, which have been prevalent for the past two years or so.  

In fact, the reason Jay gave for not inviting my sister to the wedding is because the last time she saw Emma was at their grandmother's funeral in May this year, when Emma got up and gave an incredibly drunk, boisterous eulogy that went on for over five minutes and then didn't remember giving it the next day.

When I told my mom (who was at the same funeral and saw the same thing happen) what Jay said, she said that *she* was personally insulted, and if my sister wasn't invited to the wedding, then she and my dad wouldn't be going either. She ended up writing a strongly-worded letter to Jay about how not inviting my sister was such a low blow and how she wouldn't EVER be speaking to either her or Luna ever again. 

Here's the thing: **I am invited to the wedding**, and I want to go. Jay and I don't have any problems between us, and I want to be there to support my friend at her wedding. The problem is, my sister can't seem to understand why she's not invited, and she's taking it out on my parents and me. It's gotten to the point where Emma's texted me to tell me that if i go to the wedding, mom and dad will never forgive me. I know this isn't true, but it all just makes me feel like crap. 

So, am i the asshole if i attend this wedding? Any other advice in this type of situation would also just be awesome. Thanks in advance.

80,1e0quwm,AITA for telling my father to get over the vase my son broke?,"When I was a teenager, my father bought a large glass vase, which he filled with wine corks. For years, it stayed on top of a small table in the living room.

My family visits him monthly for lunch. Last October, my son was running around my father's living room and accidentally knocked the table over, which caused the vase to fall down and break.

I immediately apologized and offered to buy a new vase. My husband and I also cleaned everything up. My father declined my offer to replace it. At the time, he said he understood it was an accident and was just glad my son hadn't gotten hurt (he was two years old at the time, and there was a lot of glass on the floor).

During the next couple of months, I apologized and offered to pay for a new vase multiple times. My father continued saying it was fine.

However, earlier this year, my father started talking about how much he loved the cork vase, and how expensive it had been back when he bought it. As the following months went by, his complaints began to escalate.

He'd make comments about the fact that my son broke the vase almost every time we came over. Occasionally, he'd also ""joke"" that we should plan our visits with longer notice so that he could hide his valuables from my kid.

Last week, he threw a party at his place, which we attended. A friend of his who hadn't visited in a while noticed the vase was gone and asked about it, to which my father replied that ""my little shit"" had broken it and I hadn't replaced it.

My husband was nearby and heard it. After the party, I confronted my father, and we fought. He said that he had the right to complain about the fact that my son had damaged his property.

I told him that while he has the right to be upset, the fact that he declined my offer to buy him a new vase does not entitle him to complain about me not doing it. He can either retract his forgiveness and work something out with me or get over the vase and stop blaming my toddler for the accident. I won't have him calling my son names over this.

82,1e0qfl0,AITA for soft-abandoning my [18m] family?,"Writing on mobile so apologies for formatting.

For context, my mom was a single mother to me and my brother until we met our dad, who is actually our step-dad but has “manned up” more than my biological father. 

So she has made quite a lot of sacrifices for me and my brother that I do appreciate. So many great memories that, when I think about them, my heart hurts in pain. However, in the last 3 months or so I’ve felt so emotionally detached from my mom and dad. They just tell me to go talk to my therapist if shit hits the fan. Perhaps it’s because I told them last X-Mas day that, “I don’t feel like as your son, I should be responsible for your feelings”. 

Things were tense around the house and I felt guilty and blamed for any little thing and would be told that I ruined my dad’s whole day or my mom’s evening blah blah. Meanwhile, I’d say nothing and just cry in my room alone—handling it alone—and not lashing out or saying insults to them. 

After months of my parents threatening to kick me out for various things, such as my room not being tidy or me not being around the house enough because I’m either at work or with my girlfriend, I decided to leave yesterday.

Since May, my weekends have been preoccupied doing stuff for my family. Mainly garden reno’s. As such, I’d only see my girlfriend either at school, or after my shift ends at work (9:30pm). She explained that she doesn’t feel prioritized at all. I’ve had to cancel plans w her that made on the weekend because of a family event or whatnot. 

Part of this is on me, because I have bad communication skills. This comes from my fear of speaking up as I’d be put down by those closest to me. 

Yesterday, after my mom started getting upset again because I didn’t want to go on our yearly camping trip (note: we have one 2x this summer), she lost it. I explained how although I understand that I am “seeing my girlfriend” for at least half of the week, sometimes more, it’s not actual “quality time” and more of: “i’ll just see her bc she’s close by.” 

Again, I was threatened to be kicked out and was encouraged to just leave. I was absolutely heartbroken, because this ultimatum and dilemma was not fair in my eyes. In the last 3 months I’ve been threatened to be kicked out or told to just leave the house like 7 times. They told me that if I left or if they kicked me out, I’d have zero support from my extended family and I will not have any money from them to be able to attend my 1st year of university.

So, I left. Went to my girlfriend’s. Stayed the night, and here I am now. 

Multiple missed calls and messages from my uncles, aunts, and dad, and I feel so guilty but at the same time I don’t. 

AITA? 

TL;DR: was threatened multiple times to get kicked out, left the house, now everyone is freaking out.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-11,"AITA for soft-abandoning my [18m] family? Writing on mobile so apologies for formatting.

For context, my mom was a single mother to me and my brother until we met our dad, who is actually our step-dad but has “manned up” more than my biological father. 

So she has made quite a lot of sacrifices for me and my brother that I do appreciate. So many great memories that, when I think about them, my heart hurts in pain. However, in the last 3 months or so I’ve felt so emotionally detached from my mom and dad. They just tell me to go talk to my therapist if shit hits the fan. Perhaps it’s because I told them last X-Mas day that, “I don’t feel like as your son, I should be responsible for your feelings”. 

Things were tense around the house and I felt guilty and blamed for any little thing and would be told that I ruined my dad’s whole day or my mom’s evening blah blah. Meanwhile, I’d say nothing and just cry in my room alone—handling it alone—and not lashing out or saying insults to them. 

After months of my parents threatening to kick me out for various things, such as my room not being tidy or me not being around the house enough because I’m either at work or with my girlfriend, I decided to leave yesterday.

Since May, my weekends have been preoccupied doing stuff for my family. Mainly garden reno’s. As such, I’d only see my girlfriend either at school, or after my shift ends at work (9:30pm). She explained that she doesn’t feel prioritized at all. I’ve had to cancel plans w her that made on the weekend because of a family event or whatnot. 

Part of this is on me, because I have bad communication skills. This comes from my fear of speaking up as I’d be put down by those closest to me. 

Yesterday, after my mom started getting upset again because I didn’t want to go on our yearly camping trip (note: we have one 2x this summer), she lost it. I explained how although I understand that I am “seeing my girlfriend” for at least half of the week, sometimes more, it’s not actual “quality time” and more of: “i’ll just see her bc she’s close by.” 

Again, I was threatened to be kicked out and was encouraged to just leave. I was absolutely heartbroken, because this ultimatum and dilemma was not fair in my eyes. In the last 3 months I’ve been threatened to be kicked out or told to just leave the house like 7 times. They told me that if I left or if they kicked me out, I’d have zero support from my extended family and I will not have any money from them to be able to attend my 1st year of university.

So, I left. Went to my girlfriend’s. Stayed the night, and here I am now. 

Multiple missed calls and messages from my uncles, aunts, and dad, and I feel so guilty but at the same time I don’t.

83,1e0q6ow,AITAH for not approving of my sons engagement. ,"My son(19M) and his girlfriend (19F) have recently moved out of my place. Originally they were renting out the second bedroom I had but there was problems that started rising and they ended up moving out. 

A few weeks ago the two of them took a vacation to Puerto rico where my son ended up proposing to her. I heard nothing about it. Nobody told me about it. I had to hear it from my daughter. I went to go see my son and talk about his decision.

I was one upset that I didn't hear it from him and had to find out last. I'm his mother I feel like I at least have the right to be in the know of whats going on with him. Especially something as big as engagement. 

Two they aren't old enough. They are literally nineteen years old. .They have their whole entire life ahead of them in order to be jumping into something binding as a marriage thats going to tie them together legally. 

I know that this is mainly her idea. The way this woman grew up everyone around her married at 16 and 19 the oldest that Ive been told. And everyday I see my son turning more and more into her. 

Not to mention that the relationship itself is childish. They still play fight, and tickle each other like high schoolers do in relationships. They are moving too fast and I told him this and he got upset with me. Asking why I'm causing problems and can't just be happy and supportive like his father. 

Of course his father would approve of something like this. The man has been making rushed and impulsive decisions like this his whole life. 

My son is a good man. Very responsible and independent. He has always been quiet and too himself. His girlfriend is not the type of girl I ever thought I would see him getting with. For one she comes from a very different background. She was raised extremely religious and has many views that are now generally known as outdated. One of those things being marriage. 

My son met this girl when he was in high school at 16 and despite this girls parents and family being extremely religious she and him both slept together. Her father found out and demanded my son marry her because he had ruined her reputation. That or leave her and never speak to her again. At the time I was out of the country and unaware until everything happened and I was angry at my son for keeping this a secret. For putting himself in this situation. As well as the girl. Why drag someone whos not apart of your culture or religion into something like this? My son told me that she had warned him that it would happen but I just dont think she put enough effort into really explaining how things would go. 

Anyways the girl got sent to her home country for a year and the two did long distance. When she came back she ended up moving in with us. It was my idea. I felt bad for her and tried to give her a chance on living a normal life. However I regret this decision because she has changed my son a lot.

85,1e0pvwi,AITA for not running around town for my family. ,"I (20f) live with my mom (49f) and brother (22m). My brother for some reason refuses to get his license. my mom has a license but refuses to get her car fixed so she uses mine for everything. heres our family dynamic. my brother is either working or sitting in his room smoking weed and playing video games. he smokes, gets the munchies and will ask my mom if she will (or me) will get him food from a fast food place.

heres where im getting fed up. they either wait for me to get all the way home from whatever i was doing to ask me to do something, or they wait until 11pm when i have to wake up at 6:30a for work to ask for it. they ask because they know i have trouble saying no to people. this is one thing that is genuinely starting to get to me. my mom confirmed that for me when i tried to tell her i was going to sleep and she got pissed because i said no to driving to the nearby rally's that is notorious for taking ages to get through just for a Mr. pibb.

so yesterday i went to get myself food. my mother  watched me leave and asked if i would be back before my brother needed to be picked up from work. she told me he needed to be picked up at 9pm, it was 7 at the time so of course. as im driving home she calls me. she tells me he actually got off at 7 and wanted to know if i would go get him. thats fine, he works close by so its not a big deal. i go get him and bring him home.

the second i go to bite into my food, my brother asks me to go back out and get him something. i dont want to. im eating, ive already settled down for the day after work. im exhausted and ive already been mcdonalds once, i dont really wanna go through a second, especially since im constantly going through the line twice for them which is lowkey fucking embarrassing. so i ask my mom to do it. she begs me to do it myself. idk it pissed me off so bad. i got angry, i made it known that i was angry, because neither of them can do anything for themselves so im left to do it. im burnt the fuck out. but i did it anyways because like i said i have trouble saying no. they dont care. i left the food in the car and said one of them would have to go get it.

then, later that night a friend invited me over. on my way home i stopped to get a drink, it was nearing 12:30 so it was way late for me. and also, they knew i went out. they watched me leave. when i walk through the door im met with 'your brother was wondering if you would get him a drink'. i look down at my phone. no texts asking me before i got home. they waited for me to get home to ask. so i said no and went to bed. she goes 'but you got yourself one'. all i said was 'yep' and went to my room. shes free to use my car as she pleases, lord knows im not allowed to tell her otherwise so she could have gone and got him a drink herself. this morning when my mom drove me to work (in my car) she was clearly pissed at me. she had an attitude and even yelled at me about gas. so, aita for not wanting to be the delivery driver for them anymore?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-11,"AITA for not running around town for my family.

86,1e0pvtt,AITA for excluding my siblings from my fathers estate?,"I'll try to keep this brief. A few years ago, my father suffered a stroke and never fully recovered. He is unable to walk and requires constant care. Since then, I have been working remotely and moved back home to help take care of him. I have two half-siblings from his side of the family who have disappeared since he had the stroke. For some context, my father wasn't close with either me or my siblings.

I have done everything: managing his finances, his business, his debts, taking him to the doctor, buying his medication, staying at the hospital when he had another stroke scare... everything. I had to sell some of his assets to cover his debts, dealt with the bank, and manage his daily needs at the retirement home where he often misbehaves due to mood changes from the stroke. I buy all his necessities like toothpaste, etc. Meanwhile, my half-siblings do absolutely nothing.

Despite my efforts to establish some relationship with them, they want nothing to do with me or our father. They haven't seen or spoken to him in five years. I even offered to pay for their travel expenses, but they took the money and did nothing. In the country where we live, children can't be excluded from a will, so when he passes away, his estate would be split four ways (he is still married to my siblings' mother).

This year, one of his businesses was struggling due to unforeseen circumstances, and my father asked me to liquidate it. He gave me power of attorney and told me he wanted me to buy a house in my name and pay him rent until he passes away. Initially, I was taken aback by this, as it would mean my siblings would receive little inheritance. However, everyone around me, including family and friends, believes my siblings don't deserve anything since they abandoned him, while I have been caring for him for the past five years.

Im getting to the point where i would rather just tell the landlord just to get rid of the smell and the fact that i can no longer step out of my apartment without shoes and without stepping in rabbit droppings so.....WIBTA ",0.0,0.0019039229955524206,0,1
91,1e0p4vu,AITA for refusing to wear the clothes my mother and sister get me?,"So I (21F) am overweight, have been since I was a teenager. I’ve gained and lost like 60 pounds over the years, it’s a lifelong struggle. 

I’m personally, not very secure or comfortable in my body, especially because, with no other way to say it, my weight is kind of distributed to my top half and since I was 11 or 12 I’ve felt sexualised by my own family (always told to cover up excessively, not to run because I’ll draw the attention of men, being pushed into bras too small to try and hide myself, etc). So I basically exclusively wear baggy, oversized shirts and/or pants because it’s what makes me comfortable. 

However, both my mother (40F) and my sister (23F) act so - in my opinion - bizzare about me and my body, it makes me very uncomfortable. They are both Muslim hijabis and I’m not, and sometimes I feel like they’re taking out their personal preferences on how to dress up on me.

They are always pushing me to shop, and always say things like “you have no idea how many people would love to have your body” or that it’s “feminine” etc (my sister has always been very skinny, she’s pregnant right now and still is slim). So they’re always buying me clothes that is revealing of my figure or just shows a lot of skin.

I’ve told them over and over - I HATE these clothes. I hate being reminded of my body, I feel insecure and just overall gross. They want me to buy more feminine dresses and things but I would prefer to stay in my baggy clothing.

Lately, they’ve been getting ridiculous - my mom bought me a dress too tight, I told her no thank you and I’ve said I don’t need or want more clothes and can buy my own. She insisted it just needed adjusting, practically manhandled me tugging at my bra and the top of the dress until I pulled away because her nails were digging into my skin. I said no, her and my sister once again almost ganged up on me telling me it’s perfect and my mom just said decisively, “You’re going to wear it, end of story,” then turned to her phone and started ignoring me. 

To be honest, I threw a bit of a tantrum - I said she never listens to me and told them I’m not a doll they can dress up, that just because they can’t show their skin or body doesn’t mean they can force me to as a compromise. I took off the dress, put it on my mom’s bed, and stormed out -naturally my friends, both religious and not, are divided. 

I’m wondering if I shouldn’t have brought up their hijabi status and if they just know what’s best for me but at the same time I want to wear what I want and not be forced into anything.

92,1e0p4s5,AITA for being a clingy friend?,"
for context my (ex)best friend (17f) and I (17f) have been best friends for about 3 solid years. I was one of her few close friends in school. (Let’s call her B) We were basically inseparable during our school years but after we finished our major exams and started our long break this whole thing happened.  This whole fiasco started around late dec/mid jan, we had met up in dec to hang out and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But nearing mid jan she said that her whatsapp had been glitchy which made it hard for her to reply to messages, and that was the reason she hadn’t been responding to me. I didn’t question her reasoning as i didn’t think she would have a reason to lie to me. 
Late jan was when the ghosting started, (i have always been the one reaching out to her) when i texted her she would take days to reply and her responses would always be curt. I was still under the impression that her whatsapp hadn’t been fixed. when she started acting like this my first thought was that i had done something to upset her. I would ask her if i had done something wrong and if she was ok. Still nothing.
Feb was when she stopped responding to everything throughout all her socials. Absolutely nothing from her, just radio silence. This goes on for a while and i still try to excuse her behaviour. One day, I see on her story that she’s been going out with another friend of hers (let’s call her V). I ask another close friend of mine about this and she said that B had gotten her whatsapp fixed a while back and that she doesn’t even know why B is treating me like this, i find out that B has been lying to me.
I’m shocked by this information and start to wonder why she’s treating me like this.  I know friendships between people who go to separate schools tend to naturally die out ,but this was so sudden .  As a last ditch attempt to get answers , i contact V and ask her how she was able to contact B. V said that she had been messaging B through whatsapp perfectly fine. (in hindsight, this seemed intrusive) The morning after, i get an angry message from B asking why the hell i contacted V. I finally ask her about the status of our relationship and she said we were still friends. Still hoping to cling onto any hope i accepted her answer. 
a month passes without any contact, i suddenly remember that B still has a book i lent her. I DM her through her instagram asking for the book back. no answer. 
a few weeks later, i DM her again . 
Then i found out she blocked me on Instagram. 
In hindsight, it was obvious that B wanted to cut me off but i was too overwhelmed at the time to see. I also wanted to try and preserve the friendship i had with her. Till this day i still don’t know why she did what she did to me. If she wanted to stop being friends with me, i would’ve respected her decision if she gave me her reasons.

94,1e0ovsc,AITA for snapping back at my mom and grandma,"For the last at least 10 years of my life or so, or as far as I can remember, my (20F) family's female members have had a habit of commenting on my appearance.  I would say I dress androgenously  with some feminine aspects but I have not worn dresses or skirts since 5th grade simply because I feel more myself in shorts or pants. They just make me more confident and are efficient in case I need to run to somewhere. 

My mom, grandma and my mom's aunt all share a similar style and all have this attitude of asking questions. I wear black most of the time, black nail polish, I wear make up only when going out with friends or if I feel like it. I have gotten countless comments from my mom and grandma like ""why do you keep wearing black, why not wear other colors"" ""why do you put on black nail polish, what about other colors"" ""why do you not wear makeup"" ""why do you not wear dresses"" etc. And usually saying ""I just like it"" or ""I dont feel like it"" towards these questions doesnt satisfy them as they just continue until I give a stern response. I have gotten into a fullblown argument with my mom when I was 16 over her wanting me to wear a dress and me not wanting to which resulted in me crying and my dad having to convince my mom to let it go. There have been other controlling behavior but as I am getting older, my mom is starting to ease down but this thing has barely changed.
 
Today, my grandma asked me why I dont wear bikinis anymore upon my mom showing her a photo from my middle school age days. I was annoyed already prior to this because I had gotten out of the shower and needed to change but my mom and grandma didnt leave the room which annoyed me but this isnt such a weird thing for my family, even tho it bothers me sometimes. Then my grandma asks the question and the convo goes like this.

Grandma>Yeah you used to wear stuff like this, why dont you do it now? 

Me> I just dont like it, I prefer this

Grandma>But it looked so beautiful on you, you should wear bikinis, when are you going to wear it except your age now?

Me>You know how you like wearing bright colors and dresses? Same way I dont like wearing bikinis

Grandma> But it'd look good on you, with the body you have now

Me> I'm sorry that I dont like bikinis (with angry tone) 

Then my mom and grandma asks me why I am getting upset, that they are just asking etc.  I also have some body image issues, I have gained weight and my family has not forgotten to make a comment of it.  I understand the thing of like oh they are old, you cant change their mind now. My mom is 60, my grandma is over 85. But I also think I am justified in snapping back because being old doesnt mean you get a free pass at making unnecessary comments about people, especially when they havent asked for. But the way my mom created made me feel like I was going overboard for getting angry. So am I the asshole?

97,1e0oej3,AITA for not signing into Netflix ,"I'm a work from home mom of 2 - a 1 year old and a 10 year old autistic child. I maintain all of the household duties from 6am to 10pm - while also making a little income as a social media manager (was my full time career prior to children).

My partner came home after work at 5. Drank beer until 8 when he showered and sat on couch. I serve him dinner. He goes to watch Netflix - which logged us out. Same for Hulu. Im nursing the baby to get her to sleep when he gets upset at not being logged in.

He proceeds to say ""you're home all day. You're seriously going to tell me you didn't watch Netflix or Hulu? Our son didn't want to watch it?""

A little surprised at the question, I stated no, he was watching YouTube and playing with our visiting cousin/aunt all day. And OBVIOUSLY if my kid asked me to sign in, I would...because it's NOT A BIG DEAL.

he huffs and puffs and just starts in. In the meantime, I grabbed the controller and logged into both account within 3 minutes and tossed it back to him.

Here's the thing - I could have swallowed my anger. But IM TIRED. I deal with children all day long regulating their emotions, why do I need to treat a 33yr old man like a child?

He continues to repeat his point that I'm home all day and could have signed in. Where I say, if it was brought to my attention I would have. I ask him why he's so upset and remind him that all he needed to do was say ""babe can you sign in for me?"" As he's done in the past, instead of choosing to be angry and fight with me.

He wants to continue to fight so I leaned in. I don't EVER cut deep and say things that we can heal from...he doesn't care. He has stated multiple times he doesn't care about my feelings and when I ask him to adjust his tone in how he speaks to me (which I've been asking him to for 10 years now) it's just an eye roll.

I told him he was being dramatic and ridiculous about the entire situation and it could've been avoided if he had just chosen to simply ask me to sign in versus fighting. When he continues to just keep coming back at me, I told him to shut up and fuck off, which I know irritates him, but after a certain point, I'm just done and I can't deal with the repetitive fight, within my eyes is completely ridiculous to begin with. I know my reaction wasn't ideal, like I said I'm just tired.

At that point, he proceeded to tell me the next time there's an issue with anything in our home that I just need to be the one to figure it out, which leads me to calling him spiteful and lazy. Because when he gets angry with me, he will intentionally not do things That I am unable to do or unable to pay for, because… It's a power-play. We had a simple issue with a household appliance and it took him over three weeks to look at it and identify the problem which was a literally a five minute fix, however, because he's lazy for three weeks. I did not have the ability to use my appliance , despite me calling two people to figure out the issue and researching it online and telling him what I believe the issue was. So I try. I really do try to take care of what I can take care of and not add extra things to his list, knowing that he does work hard outside of the home. However, I just feel like I'm constantly overlooked because I'm just ""at home with the kids"".

Am I the asshole for not swallowing my irritation and instead asking him why he felt the need to lash out and then tell me he wasn't going to help with anything in the future?",TL;DR,2024-07-11,"AITA for not signing into Netflix  I'm a work from home mom of 2 - a 1 year old and a 10 year old autistic child.

Here's the thing - I could have swallowed my anger. But IM TIRED. I deal with children all day long regulating their emotions, why do I need to treat a 33yr old man like a child?

He continues to repeat his point that I'm home all day and could have signed in. Where I say, if it was brought to my attention I would have. I ask him why he's so upset and remind him that all he needed to do was say ""babe can you sign in for me?"" As he's done in the past, instead of choosing to be angry and fight with me.

He wants to continue to fight so I leaned in. I don't EVER cut deep and say things that we can heal from...he doesn't care. He has stated multiple times he doesn't care about my feelings and when I ask him to adjust his tone in how he speaks to me (which I've been asking him to for 10 years now) it's just an eye roll.

I told him he was being dramatic and ridiculous about the entire situation and it could've been avoided if he had just chosen to simply ask me to sign in versus fighting. When he continues to just keep coming back at me, I told him to shut up and fuck off, which I know irritates him, but after a certain point, I'm just done and I can't deal with the repetitive fight, within my eyes is completely ridiculous to begin with. I know my reaction wasn't ideal, like I said I'm just tired.

At that point, he proceeded to tell me the next time there's an issue with anything in our home that I just need to be the one to figure it out, which leads me to calling him spiteful and lazy. Because when he gets angry with me, he will intentionally not do things That I am unable to do or unable to pay for, because… It's a power-play. We had a simple issue with a household appliance and it took him over three weeks to look at it and identify the problem which was a literally a five minute fix, however, because he's lazy for three weeks. I did not have the ability to use my appliance , despite me calling two people to figure out the issue and researching it online and telling him what I believe the issue was. So I try. I really do try to take care of what I can take care of and not add extra things to his list, knowing that he does work hard outside of the home. However, I just feel like I'm constantly overlooked because I'm just ""at home with the kids"".

Idk. Am I the asshole for not swallowing my irritation and instead asking him why he felt the need to lash out and then tell me he wasn't going to help with anything in the future?",,-0.0029737858567386866,0,0

My sister has always undermined any achievement or happy news of mine since we were young, so this reaction didn’t surprise me. My fiancé thinks that she is probably upset because our engagement is not about her and she loves attention.

This was about two months about and since then my fiance and I are starting to make wedding plans.

I have explained that not only has my friend been by my side through some tough situations (my parents are aware of this), she was/is actually happy for me whereas my sister was not.

104,1e0lrlh,AITA for Wanting More Attention from My Parents Despite My Sibling's Needs?,"
I (17F) am the younger sister of my brother (21M), who has severe disabilities. My brother’s needs are extensive, requiring round-the-clock care and attention from my parents (45M and 43F). Because of this, I’ve often felt like the ""glass kid"" — the one who’s expected to quietly manage on her own without causing any extra burden.

Growing up, I learned to be self-sufficient. I did my homework alone, cooked my own meals, and rarely asked for help. While I understand why my parents had to focus so much on my brother, it hasn’t stopped the growing sense of neglect. The final straw came last month when I starred in a school play and neither of my parents could make it. They promised they'd come, but then there was an emergency with my brother. I ended up performing in front of an empty seat where they were supposed to be.

Feeling frustrated, I decided to bring it up during a rare family dinner. I told my parents how I felt invisible and wished they could find a way to be there for me sometimes too. My mom burst into tears, and my dad looked furious. He told me I was being selfish and that I should be more grateful for the sacrifices they make. My brother, who can't speak, watched the whole exchange silently, and I couldn't help but feel like the worst person in the world.

In the days following, my parents barely spoke to me. I could tell they were hurt, and I started to question if I was wrong to even bring it up. I talked to my best friend about it, and she thinks I'm justified in wanting more attention, but my grandparents and extended family have weighed in, saying I need to be more understanding and mature given the circumstances.

Despite feeling guilty, I can't shake the feeling of loneliness and the desire for a bit more parental attention. I know my brother's needs are immense and non-negotiable, but does that mean my feelings don't matter at all?

So, AITA for wanting my parents to notice me more and be part of my life, even if it means they have to stretch themselves even thinner?

I never agreed to anything, ever. I have been very, very open about how much I hate it and how uncomfortable it is, knowing that all this stuff about me can be seen by anyone with access to the internet. anyone can just search up my name on instagram and find this. 
she also says ""you got your Nintendo switch so you have to do it!"" but no, dad bought that for the family, completely unrelated to the instagram.

I would argue about doing the reels for a solid 20 minutes until she gave up. she would always punish me for it. it usually went something like this:
me- ""no I'm not doing anything for your instagram""
mum- ""why not? all your friends have instagram accounts!""
""not all of them do! how many times do I have to tell you that im not comfortable with your instagram!""

""I don't get why this is so hard! I'll take your phone for the weekend if you don't do the reel!""
""okay, take my phone then, are we done now?""
""you still have to do it!""
and we just go in circles...

eventually we got into an argument so bad, around 2-3 years ago. it involved a lot of screaming and tears, in public. she promised that she would stop the reels, but would still post.

whenever I go to competitions I have to beg my dad to take me and because mum will try and film this and that, take a million photos in different poses and perspectives and it throws me off. recently she tried to get me to film a reel again, she tried guilt tripping me and gaslighting me, saying she never agreed to no reels. I even asked my dad and he said he remembers her saying she wouldn't do reels anymore.

I just don't get what's so hard to understand? me no want this on instagram. 

even my dad says I should do this to make her happy. but I don't think this is right, ill do something else, why does it have to be this? for the past several years she's had this account I've hated every second of it. it's played a huge part in my depression as well.

I'm on the verge of quitting this sport just so I don't have to deal with this anymore. I really don't want to, I love it and I've dedicated so much time and effort to it and I love playing competitions with all my friends. I'd hate to throw it all away because of this. I've tried numerous times to get my mum to drop the instagram but it won't happen. 
so all I can do is ask, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-11,"AITA for asking my mum to delete her instagram account? I have been playing a sport since I was a toddler. my mum has made an instagram account around me and my younger sibling abt the sport.
 
my sibling agreed that if we got a pet, they would do the reels and all that. so we did get a pet, and they do the instagram reels.

I never agreed to anything, ever. I have been very, very open about how much I hate it and how uncomfortable it is, knowing that all this stuff about me can be seen by anyone with access to the internet. anyone can just search up my name on instagram and find this. 
she also says ""you got your Nintendo switch so you have to do it!"" but no, dad bought that for the family, completely unrelated to the instagram.

I would argue about doing the reels for a solid 20 minutes until she gave up. she would always punish me for it. it usually went something like this:
me- ""no I'm not doing anything for your instagram""
mum- ""why not? all your friends have instagram accounts!""
""not all of them do! how many times do I have to tell you that im not comfortable with your instagram!""
""that's stupid, I'm not telling people what school you go to and your personal life, why are you so selfish, you're a terrible person, I cook and do so much for you and you can't do this for me? this is the one thing I enjoy!""
""I'll do something else! go make reels about yourself if you like making content so much!""
""I'm boring, what would I film about?""
""go find a hobby then""
""I don't get why this is so hard! I'll take your phone for the weekend if you don't do the reel!""

I’ve had a troubling last few years with addiction, and I have been spending the last 4 months really trying to self-rehab, but I do still drink often. But the other stuff, I’ve been good I like to believe.

My parents both have put a solid foot forward in helping me get out of really shoddy situations, be it in different ways (I.e. my mom would let me stay with her and buy me food and my dad also helped me get shelter). So I feel extremely grateful for them and I don’t understand why I feel so on edge. 

A couple of days ago I was helping my mom move but I used the wrong trash bags to cover her clothes, and when she saw it she went from zero to 100, and kept bringing up my previous addiction which I kept asking her not to do in the past. I felt like it was an innocent mistake and didn’t deserve a reprise of how it’s because of the addiction because it wasn’t—it was the result of lack of communication for where the proper bags were. 

So I did tell her “F YOU” and stormed out. My younger cousin was there and he followed me and told me that statement hurt him as well, “But I didn’t curse at you?” Is how I replied, but he expressed that the vitriol behind it made him feel a type of way. I told him I understood and apologized and I texted my mom saying I was wrong, but I still feel a little insane and I wish they would stop bringing it up.

I’ve been so overwhelmed with my own stress and work that I haven’t really had a moment to breathe, let alone had a moment for other people. My best friend mentioned how he and other friends will sometimes send each other little care packages of snacks and treats as a reminder to say that they’re thinking of them. 

I currently have no income and I am really strapped for cash because of my bar study expenses and just not having a job right now. My friend knows my economic situation. my friend had a really hard week so I wanted to do something nice for him and I went on Uber Eats and I ordered $100 worth of snack groceries. I ordered his favorite candies, a big assortment of chips, ice cream, candies, his favorite fruit, etc. I ordered a lot of little snacks because I thought it might make him happy and that way he could have some fun things to eat throughout the week and remember me by.

I called him to ask if he received a gift, and he said he did and thanks, but he doesn’t really like the chips I got. I was really taken aback: I was raised to be grateful for anything you receive. I told him, “Gee, I was hoping you’d be a little happier,” and he said, “well, do you want me to lie? I like practical and functional gifts. Your gifts felt hollow.” I wanted to cry.

109,1e0klmx,AITA Not invited niece / nephew to my wedding,"My Fiancé (32F) and I (32M) are getting married next year. I am English and she is French, we live England though. We decided to get married in the south of France in her home town as it’s a nicer place with better weather than the UK. 

We told everyone our plans two years before so they could start saving and making plans as it would be over a weekend. We’ve got a huge farm house with bedrooms and clamping tents so all our family and friends can be in one place. Friday to Monday, wedding on Saturday. 

We decided we didn’t want children at the event and told everyone with 18 months to go that this was the case. Went 121 with our friends that had children and explained this and they all said no problem….

Apart from my sister. She said that it was a family reunion and a family party and that her two children (time of the wedding 5M and 3F) should be invited. I said that this is our choice for a number of reasons. We don’t have children, our dog will be there and he is reactive to children so will cause us stress. There’s an open pool so the venue said legally we’d have to hire a lifeguard if anyone under 6 is at the venue. We don’t like children, and we want my parents and family to be present and not having to care after kids. 

It’s selfish on our part but this is the one day when we’d like everyone to just be present. Especially my parents who would end up caring for them and I want them to be there for me. 

My cousin was married recently and he said that he was upset his dad spent the entire wedding looking after his grandson and didn’t speak to him. 

My sister said that she might not be able to come as her husband (who said he didn’t want to come to the wedding) wouldn’t be able to look after the children (whole other story - but not my problem). We gave her 18 Months to find a solution but we can’t do it for her. 

Either way it meant a lot to her so we compromised and said we would do our official ceremony in England so she could attend and be there with my niece and nephew so there were there officially when we got married. And our event in France would be a celebration. That was how we met her half way and she could still come to France and relax and have a few days drinking and having fun all paid for by us. She has since said that if her kids aren’t invited to France as well she won’t come to either event. 

Our reply was fair enough. If you don’t want to attend either that’s your choice, you are still invited to both. Your children are invited to our ceremony in the UK but we won’t be changing our mind. 

AITA?

*UPDATE - just to address some of the comments, didn’t realise there would be so many thank you! 

Initially when we were planning we knew we didn’t want children there but thought about daycare. We were going to organise on site daycare service where parents could leave kids to be looked after and keep popping in to go see them. My sister said no way would she be allowing that and she wouldn’t use it. Her kids would attend the wedding and spend the day with family. So after that we changed to no children as it’s easier. 

It’s over a number of days but the official day is still only on one day. Some family and friends are coming for just the Saturday, flying out in the morning and leaving Sunday morning. This is also an option so childcare could be easier. 

She would have been in her own room not a glancing tent. 

The flights there are maximum two hours so not thousands of miles so it’s an easy journey. 

About our dog, I mentioned reactive as it was easier for a quick post. He likes teenagers and babies, toddlers that are running around and screaming scare him and he likes to chase and herd them (being a herding breed). We’ve working on being scared but hard to change the herding behaviour. As that would happen with 2 children or more it’s best to avoid it. 

I was quick to say we don’t like children, just that we are not fussed. We don’t have children, not at that point in our life. We have lots of children in the family and friends children we adore and spoil. Just when it comes to a wedding we wouldn’t choose them to celebrate with like we would adults. I was careless with my words. 

And final update. Just had my sister on the phone calling me a selfish pr**k and an evil ba****d for not inviting them and if I don’t then she’ll never speak to me again. She doesn’t care at all about how we met her half way and changed our plans. Her kids should be at this family event how dare I say who can and can’t come to our wedding….

110,1e0k2o3,AITA for not taking on more chores but instead offer to pay for cleaning service despite my partners increased work load? ,"Me (27M) and my partner (25F) has been dating for 3.5 years and we have a great, respectful relationship.

I'm about 2.5 years older than her so when we began dating in late 2020, I just graduated from my masters while she was entering her senior year in college.

We've been living together for about 2 years and for the past few years we've always been splitting our bills 80/20, which i have no problem with.

When it comes to chores, our apartments have always been on the smaller side (450-500 sqft) so we didn't really have to do a lot of cleaning. We take turns to do laundry, I drive and buy groceries (she doesn't have her full license yet) and clean the bathroom.
She's usually in charge of recycling and vacuuming.

Cooking is a bit tricky because we don't normally eat together so we have separate meals about 2/3 of the time. 

I normally just each sandwich, salad or cook some simple meals for myself but she's a brilliant cook so she can always cook some amazing dishes once in a while.

We also don't do dishes together because I have a minor OCD and MUST clean all the utensils right away while she someone's wait for 1-2 meals before cleaning them all together. So if I'm cooking I'll do all the dishes with in an hour but if she's cooking maybe the next day or two.


She recently started her first fulltime job after finishing grad school and told me she wants to contribute more for the bills (60/40 split), which I greatly appreciate!

We recently moved to a much larger apartment (900sqft) but due to her new job she doesn't have much time doing chores at all so this has become a big problem for us.

Our chores used to be split about equal but now with her new job as a teacher, she has to spend more time at home doing lesson planning and grading, on average about 2 hours a day so she doesn't have much time for her end of the chores.

I do have more time in hand but honestly I prefer spending my own time doing something I like instead of picking up more chores, especially since I'm already contributing more financially.


I offered to hire cleaning service once a week so she doesn't have to do anything but dishes and recycle but she's strongly against this idea and said I'm just lazy.


She does around 50 hours of work (40+10 hour preparation at home), but I'm also working 40 hours full time. And we've already been splitting chores equally despite me contributing more financially.

111,1e0jtkz,"AITA Am i in the wrong by declining the dinner invitation, as the venue was changed last moment?","So me and my very close friend, both male in our twenties are friends since our school days. He got into a nice collage and wanted to give a farewell dinner to me and 2 other friends. 

He wanted to watch a sports match aswell (that was one of the reasons for the get to gether aswell) so he picked a restaurant which had that screening facility and informed me. I accepted and was ready for it, not for the match as i do not have any interest in it but for the farewell. 

After a few days he changes the restaurant to a nightclub and had already booked it without informing. I have to be honest i am not interested in going to such places as neither do i drink nor do i enjoy the vibes of it. His reasoning was that this place had a discount on a card. It 

As he had already booked it and it was his occasion i did not want to rub my interests on it. I  informed him of my POV and said him i cannot attend it, i could go to any other place but not that sort of place. 
He went along with the others to that place watched half the match and had a drink or two and left it and went to another restaurant as the food was bad there.
I felt sad and left out as he did not even check other options, and even he did not enjoy the place the he might aswell could've researched a bit. But i did not want to make it about my preference as it was his event.

Fast forward to 5 days later, we talk, he tells me about the details and says that he is having another get together with other old friends 
(who also drink and are on normal terms with both of us i.e casual friends who we rarely meet or not really close with.) He said he invited the friend who came to the first place aswell. After some time we ended the call, he did not invite me, i know because those friends and i are not really close and i dont drink so its obvious. But he did not even offer.

Now fast forward to almost a month, we did not talk during this period maybe expect once. He will be leaving soon, even through the differences i felt i should not keep that in mind and called him. He is going for a dinner with his neighbours kids (his age), he even hid some specific things which he had bought, about which he would definitely talk to me about before he buys, which he revealed after the call.
Man even if it was a quick bite back then i would've been glad. Him inviting everyone except me, suddenly not even talking about common things, feels like we are moving apart. After he goes to the college, we wont be meeting for couple of years.

Just because  i declined something which felt forced, am i not his bestfriend anymore?",TL;DR,2024-07-11,"AITA Am i in the wrong by declining the dinner invitation, as the venue was changed last moment? So me and my very close friend, both male in our twenties are friends since our school days. He got into a nice collage and wanted to give a farewell dinner to me and 2 other friends. 

He wanted to watch a sports match aswell (that was one of the reasons for the get to gether aswell) so he picked a restaurant which had that screening facility and informed me. I accepted and was ready for it, not for the match as i do not have any interest in it but for the farewell. 

After a few days he changes the restaurant to a nightclub and had already booked it without informing. I have to be honest i am not interested in going to such places as neither do i drink nor do i enjoy the vibes of it. His reasoning was that this place had a discount on a card. It 

As he had already booked it and it was his occasion i did not want to rub my interests on it. I  informed him of my POV and said him i cannot attend it, i could go to any other place but not that sort of place. 
He went along with the others to that place watched half the match and had a drink or two and left it and went to another restaurant as the food was bad there.
I felt sad and left out as he did not even check other options, and even he did not enjoy the place the he might aswell could've researched a bit. But i did not want to make it about my preference as it was his event.

Fast forward to 5 days later, we talk, he tells me about the details and says that he is having another get together with other old friends 
(who also drink and are on normal terms with both of us i.e casual friends who we rarely meet or not really close with.) He said he invited the friend who came to the first place aswell. After some time we ended the call, he did not invite me, i know because those friends and i are not really close and i dont drink so its obvious. But he did not even offer.

Now fast forward to almost a month, we did not talk during this period maybe expect once. He will be leaving soon, even through the differences i felt i should not keep that in mind and called him. He is going for a dinner with his neighbours kids (his age), he even hid some specific things which he had bought, about which he would definitely talk to me about before he buys, which he revealed after the call.
Man even if it was a quick bite back then i would've been glad. Him inviting everyone except me, suddenly not even talking about common things, feels like we are moving apart. After he goes to the college, we wont be meeting for couple of years.

112,1e0jsw1,AITA for insisting my brother and wife stop accepting gifts from shareholders?,"My brother is the CEO of a company he started, I also work for the company and sit on the board and am COO. 

We recently took on a new investor who also has taken on a new role at the company at the same time. 

My brother the CEO took a 10k personal loan from the same shareholder without any disclosure. The loan is interest free. When I found out I confronted my brother and found out it's an interest free loan which amounts to a gift.

The same shareholder got a little drunk at a party where our CFO was also in attendance and told the CFO he lent the money to control our CEO. 

We as a company talked about this and said we should keep the investor at arms reach until we could really check him out. What he said at the party was weird but people are not themselves when they drink too much but what was said was alarming.

2 weeks later the CEO asks the board if it was a conflict if he takes an offer of a family holiday accommodation in a foreign country as a gift from the same shareholder. We obviously all said not a good idea. 

This agitated the CEO to start saying we were ""ganging up on him"" and that the offer was made to him and his wife weeks ago (just before or after the incident where investor claimed the loan was to control CEO). The fact that the offer was made then and only coming to light now seems crazy. 

Now the SIL is also joining in and saying that I'm misguided and it's none of my business and that I have ulterior motives and a penance for drama.

113,1e0js9g,AITA if I don't want to bail out my partner with money issues ?,"Hello !

My partner (28F) and I (31M) have been together for eight years. We're both very much in love with each other and basically each other's best friend. I've always tried to push her towards her dreams and I want her to be independent financially, so that if anything happens to me she'll be able to hold her own, as I know I will if anything happens to her.

My partner is disabled (PTSD, anxiety, autism and ADHD, but still very independent socially) and therefore receives a stipend from the State (not the US). It's an *okay* stipend. She can live but not lavishly, she just has to be careful with how her money is spent. Since I earn more money, we don't split things 50/50. We use a weighted system, I think it's something like 60-40%. This way, what I pay for rent (which is like 33% of my income), she pays the same in percentage relative to her income.

But even then... my partner is *extremely* bad with money. She's been receiving letters upon letters of unpaid invoices which she hasn't opened (I think there's twenty). She smokes an ungodly amount of cigarettes which I've calculated comes out at hundreds of euros per month.

She owes me about 4k in groceries, vet bills, unpaid bills, (even with the weighted expense system) and the numerous times I've bailed her out, once we even had because we had a court bailiff ring at our door about unpaid invoices. I caved in and paid.

I'm frankly getting stressed out because I've tried helping her managing her money, tracking her expenses, setting up moments to pay our bills together, I even proposed her to get an app, and she always ends up skipping everything.

We're even going to couple's therapy now over this because I've been losing sleep, worrying about her. She says she'll change, I've yet to see it.

She asked me to bail her out once again, although the last time I bailed her out, she said she'd change. She didn't.

I refused. She's sad and scared.

What am I supposed to do ? Do I let her crash herself so that she might learn, or do I continue to bail her out, which I'm afraid won't help her ?

114,1e0jrp7,WIBTA if the next time my friend makes an insensitive comment to me I enforce a friendship ultimatum?,"TL;DR: friend has said and done things that make me feel like i’m a nuisance to be around, should i tell them to start acting like they like me or stop being friends with me

So I (17f) have this friend (18f). We have always been pretty close but for a long while I’ve been getting the feeling that they dislike being around me sometimes. One example is that they’ve said they’re not big on physical contact with friends, that is ok with me but the thing that irks me is they seem to be fine with it with our other friends, hugging them occasionally, holding hands, sort of the friendly cuddling stuff girl best friends do but when I’ve tried to hug them after seeing that they seemed comfortable with it they acted sort of repulsed?? and would say things like “shoo”. 

When I was having internal problems with a guy I was dating who I was afraid to really commit to (I never cheated, was just unsure if I wanted to enter a relationship with him or really liked him), I talked to this friend about it and they said my problems were triggering and I reminded them of their toxic ex who really hurt them, and they commented things like this several times about my love life when I told them I might have attachment issues, saying I was like their ex. This kind of rubbed me the wrong way because this ex was pretty awful to them and I felt uncomfortable being compared to someone like that. 
 
After that it felt even more like they disliked me and I talked to them about it and they said they like me very much, but since then they have made several comments pertaining to my intelligence, saying they don’t think i’m capable of taking things seriously, calling me airheaded, implying i’m not smart enough, etc. 

It kind of hurts to hear because i’ve had so many people in my life make me feel like i’m stupid and it’s discouraging to hear that im not serious or smart enough to be capable of achieving certain goals.

I just kind of feel like they don’t like hanging out with me overall but there are moments where they are nice to me and tell me they appreciate me (which are pretty rare).
What i want to know is, am I taking this too seriously? WIBTA if the next time they made another insensitive comment to me, I told them to either start treating me like they treat our other friends and be nicer to me or I would stop being their friend? 

All I know is that most of my other friends don’t make me feel like this, and friends are supposed to make each other feel good about themselves.

Well I make good money now and about five years ago I helped her get a non profit started. She gets stray dogs and cats medical attention. 

She has partnered with a vet to sterilize and release strays. 

I get a tax write-off because of the way we set up her non profit. My government has made a gift to a large NGO that funnels money to smaller groups. I donate to them and they give her a large chunk of the money.

They think I value dogs and cats more than them. I do not. But over the last twenty years I developed a relationship with Astrid. And she worked with me to make sure that this could be a win win situation. 

I realize the money I give could help my family but if I split it with everyone asking then they will each get enough for a beer and a pack of gum. By concentrating on one person I think I'm making a difference. I know I am for her and for the animals.

I’m moving from Chicago to LA for my first big girl job. I’ll be commuting 100 miles round trip for work M-F from my mom’s place (where she is very kindly letting me live). I will obviously need to purchase a car. 


I genuinely do not give a flying fuck what I drive. All I care is that the car is (1) fuel efficient, (2) reliable, and (3) any issues can be fixed relatively inexpensively. In undergrad, I leased a Prius C and loved it - as it meets all my requirements and is very competitively priced, I’ve decided to purchase a used model. I’ve been a grad student and post-doc for the last 6 years and have no savings (academia, am I right?) so I was planning to finance it. 


I told my mom my plan and she insisted that she would just pay for it out of pocket and I could pay her back to avoid paying interest. The car I plan to buy is a 2016 Prius C with 99k miles for 16k dollars plus taxes and fees (I know that’s kind of high but I’m buying from a very reputable place and getting their highly rated extended warranty so the extra 1-2k I’m paying is worth the peace of mind to me). With my salary, I should be able to pay her back in 6 months, 4 if I’m really aggressive. **I would just like to make it clear that I know how incredibly fortunate I am to have a parent who is willing and able to support me in this way.** I am INCREDIBLY grateful that my mom is offering me this money and essentially saving me about 6k. 


The problem is, my mom (and all of her fucking friends) think my car choice is a mistake. Most of them think I should get a new car because “a doctor shouldn’t be driving a used car” - this is asinine to me. I grew up poor and financial insecurity scares the living daylights out of me. The idea of spending tens of thousands of dollars more than I need to on a car when I have *no savings* just for the sake of appearances makes me want to vomit.


There were a ton of other reasons her friends gave for why a used Prius C was a horrible idea ranging from silly to downright idiotic but I’ve held firm in wanting to purchase it. And for what it’s worth, my mom has assured me that she trusts my judgement and will happily give me the money for whichever car I think is best. That being said, my mom has *also* made it clear that she’d prefer I buy a newer model with less mileage on it. I’ve tried to explain to her that Prius’s are some of the most reliable and durable cars out there. Everyone I know who has a Prius has driven it until it had well over 250k miles on it. It’s a *Toyota*, for gods sake!

119,1e0jh01,AITA because of my mom's lifestyle,"my mom(f42) is polyamorus. I'm not saying I don't support her. I don't care that she's bisexual and poly, but it bothers me because she has a husband.

she's married to my step-dad (m35) and has a boyfriend. her boyfriend is a nice guy, I like him a lot, but it just bothers me a lot because of past trauma.

when my mother was married to my dad(m44) she had an affair with my now step-dad. the divorced really traumatized me and it didn't help that my shifty dad was feeding lies about my mom to me. 

the affair had been the reason they divorced,  and that divorced had scarred me. I still have to talk about it in therapy and the divorce happened 9 years ago.

I really don't know if I'm the asshole..it's hard that I(f16) have this constant anxiety and fear that my mom and step-dad will divorce. I'm not ready to feel that feeling again. I feel really crappy about this.

120,1e0j69m,AITA for cutting off a leech,"Throwaway for privacy

My elderly father is in mental decline. His dementia is sometimes better sometimes worse but due to a recent accident and hospitalization it is on the worse side at the moment.

Even before he was not so mentally stable but got along on his own and with our support. He also has a friend (f) from the neighborhood that gave him company and they sometimes did smaller trips together.

Since the hospital he can no longer go to the bank or do any kind of bank related stuff on his own and asks for our help. Said friend has recently asked for some money from my father and he asked me to give it to her. It was \~300$ and I did not ask any questions.

A few weeks later she came back and asked for more than double of that because she got an unexpected bill and I hesitantly paid her that money too but told my father that I have the feeling that she is using him. He (apparently) had a brighter moment and agreed.

A few weeks later (now) she asks for money again - and I found out a few things about her in the meantime. It seems she is taking money from him for a few more month already - I only see the ATM statements of what my father took out with his card. He would not need so much cash on his own so I presume it went to her wallet, but he does not know if he did. Also she seems to be ""working with elderly people"" apart from visiting my dad. So I suspect that this is her business model: getting close to elderly people that enjoy the company and leech them for money.

So I intend to cut her off to prevent any more of this.

AITA here?

She might really have trouble paying her bills and a few hundred $ will not hurt my dad. She will likely stop seeing my dad and he seems to like the company.

For all people suggesting to ask my dad: He does not really have an opinion of his own anymore and will say yes to whatever we suggest.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-11,"AITA for cutting off a leech Throwaway for privacy

121,1e0ipya,AITA for calling out my friend Edgar for being a creep?,"I (Greg) was at a bar last night with my uni (college) friends Edgar, Allan and Po (pseudonyms obviously). We were all drinking pretty heavily as Edgar and I had just finished our final exams. Po is this amazing international student who's basically been the queen of our friend group since she joined. She fitted right into our dynamic and banter seamlessly. 

Anyway, Edgar was being his usual sleazy self, constantly hitting on Po and making everyone visibly uncomfortable. Seriously, I had to move his seat when he left the table so he wasn’t cutting her off from the rest of us, she’s 5-foot-nothin’ so couldn’t see over his big head. I could tell she was grateful by the way she looked at me.

For some background, in our Discord server we often stay up late gaming and chatting, and sometimes it's just the three of us left on the call - me, Edgar, and Po. And let me tell you, it gets uncomfortable fast. Edgar starts making these suggestive comments, and Po's trying to laugh it off, but I can tell she's uncomfortable. I feel like I need to stay on the call to make sure Edgar doesn't cross any lines. It's like I'm babysitting their interactions, waiting for Po to excuse herself so I can finally relax.

Edgar’s also always trying to show off in front of her and it’s honestly embarrassing. We went out to get Boba (which Po loves because her Mum always used to make it for her). We were having a really great conversation with lots of laughter and Edgar cuts in to do a dumbass joke where he pretends the Boba straw is a cigar. He honestly can’t read a room to save his life, and it’s moments like these I questions my friendship with him. 

Anyway, back to the bar. Things seemed to get better once I remedied the seating situation, but here's the kicker: Allan got kicked out shortly after for being too drunk (he did a backflip on the dancefloor). Po left with him (to make sure he got home okay). And Edgar had the nerve to act all surprised and concerned, like ""Oh no, Po's gone off with that loser Allan!"" Meanwhile, I'm thinking, ""Dude, you're the real loser here - you've been making Po uncomfortable all night!"" So I called Edgar out on his BS, and he got all defensive and stuff. He's like ""I'm just being friendly!"" but we all know what's really going on. I was pretty vocal about it, maybe even a bit too vocal... let's just say I had a few choice words for Edgar.

122,1e0ile3,AITA for dispassionately telling my mom I don't like hearing her recollections of my early childhood? ,"EDIT: I was wrong, if this happens again I will keep my mouth shut.

(I've told my parents several times I dislike hearing stories from when I was a toddler. My mom has acknowledged this and even mentioned that she disliked when her parents did the same.)

My parents have been planning a trip, and there's an amusement park in the vicinity of our destination. We've been there before, when I was four years old.

My mom is very talkative. Recently she keeps telling a story about how she was at a scary ride with me, and an employee came over and said I was too young to go in. The first two times I heard it I just said ""uh...huh"" and didn't really want to continue the conversation.

Today as I go to work she says it again. I say, ""you keep telling the same story, I'm not that interested."" She seems worked up and says ""but you keep telling stories of the dead cat you once kept in your own apartment."" I say ""Well I can stop talking about that, but it's not like you're the cat."" Then she says ""you were so cute as a child, why don't you want to hear?"" And I reply ""I don't want to be called cute for something I did as a child."" She replies ""Fine, you were so annoying as a child, why don't you want to hear?"" Then I replied ""if it's so annoying then why do you want to keep talking about it?""

I leave my room. She says ""we rarely traveled when you were young. These are the only stories we have."" I mention two tourist locations around my hometown I wanted to visit, but wasn't taken to, and she asks ""why don't you just go now?"" I reply ""I don't really want to go to this other amusement park alone. I'm just saying you didn't seem to want to travel then."" She told me we didn't have money then (possibly true but I wasn't told then.)

As I pack up my bags for work, she says ""talking to you is so tiring, you never have a good attitude, why can't you be open minded and happy. Have I ever held an annoyed attitude towards you?"" And I say ""Yeah. I used to do the dishes but you told me I washed them incorrectly, so you now clean them yourself."" She argues that it's not the same thing and says I should think about my attitude and that she doesn't want to tell at me because I'm too old for it. After a minute I say ""I've thought about it, I can see that maybe I should have asked more nicely, but what did you expect? I've told you I don't like hearing stories from when I was a child.""

At 10AM the following morning I was awoken by my dad calling me to discuss plans about my grandmother's funeral and for me to to get back home early that day to help him out with arrangements, as soon as the call was done, I fell back to sleep for about 3 hours, after a couple hours in the house with my friend, as we were walking to a nearby shop at about 4pm, my dad calls me and is furious that I am still in this city and not on my way back home to help him out. I apologise profusely and try to make another plan with him for me to go back later. He tells me it's too late for me to come back now to help as he is looking after my disabled sister and can't leave her alone for a long period of time.

The recent one is related to our vacations. My bf likes to really relax and usually drinks a lot during our vacations. The problem is he then always looses his temper at day 3 or 4 because as I said, he drinks a lot and drinking for few days is not an easy task for the body. The problem is at some point he will loose his temper and do something bad to me. For example when we were in Egypt he blew up at me and started throwing my things out of our room, which only stopped when I said I have a video of him and will send it into his family group chat. Last year in Granada he got super offended I wantet to buy lube and everything escalated to the point that he was pulling me and screaming at me in the middle of the street. Needless to say I am numb in those moments and it is not really relaxing for me. I don't drink on our vacations because well we don't need more fuel to the fire.

Now to the problem; summer is here again and he does still drink at least one day a week, but usually more as it is picnic season etc. I really wanted to go to Asia but I am terrified of having one of this situations there. Flying from EU to Asia is stressful enough without alcohol as it is. I am scared to be alone in a third country while he is possibly again breaking his promise about not drinking and hurting me. It is also a very very expensive trauma to get. My BFF which is my all, suggested that we go together with her and her bf so they can be as a buffer if he goes crazy with drinking again. This is where I may be the AH: I told my bf that I don't want to do Asia alone with him and would prefer EU, he is hurt I don't trust him and says he will go with friends and probably have a better time.

126,1e0hsdu,AITA for getting study materials from my ex while my boyfriend was visiting?,"
My boyfriend (32M) and I (32F) have been in a long distance for 6 months. We’ve managed to see each other a lot and things are going well.

This week while he’s visiting, I’ve been studying for a big work exam. He’s been very supportive and given me the space I need.

He came into my office to check in on me and I was showing him something on my computer. He saw my inbox and therein an email from my ex boyfriend. Context: my ex and I are on good terms but not friendly by any means. He works in the same industry (my boyfriend knows this) and had recently done the exam, so his email contained study resources.

He proceeded to storm out of my office and get ready to leave the house. I asked him to stop and, he said I clearly was lying and talking to him all day. He left for about two hours, saying he needed space and felt nauseous.

I should mention that he has been feeling insecure about our relationship lately and has exhibited signs of anxious attachment. He told me he loved me a month and a half into dating, but having been single for so long, it’s taking me longer to get to where he is. It has been a source of contention for a while.

His response felt so dramatic and uncalled for. I am currently in bed, panicked about my exam that I’ve now been fully distracted from, while he is in the other room, having ignored me since he came back. I feel so hurt but also angry that he reacted in this way the night before my exam, making me extremely anxious and stressed about the fate of our relationship.

I don’t feel I didn’t anything wrong (I asked just about everyone for exam tips!) but worry I’ve irrecoverably ruined our relationship.

(I know this is risky but there were KIDS!) Another lady stopped right next to me and put her hazards on.

She loves plants, so as a going away gift I got her a really nice ceramic planter that's her favorite colors. It's about a foot tall and kind of heavy, but not hard to carry. She didn't seem thrilled when I gave to to her, but I thought she was just sad about leaving. 

Turns out she was mad about the planter because she walked to work and had to carry it all the way home with her. Another coworker (I'll call her Lisa) told me this today, and I didn't know what to say. Lisa said she thought it was a thoughtful gift and Sue was overreacting, but someone else said it was rude because I should have known Sue would have to carry it home. 

The reason I think I could be TAH is I did know Sue walked to work, but I assumed she would drive on her last day to bring all her personal belongings along with any gifts home. Sue has a car and drives when she goes longer distances, but she lived fairly close to our work and opted to walk instead.

129,1e0h100,AITA for bringing up shaving my head to my cancer survivor mother?,"I, 18F, have had very long hair for many years now. I've always talked about wanting to cut it, because to be honest I'm getting pretty sick of all the maintenance it requires. However, the other day when I brought up shaving my head my mother got very upset. She, 50F, got cancer about 12 years ago and lost all of her hair. It has never quite grown back to what it used to be and I have the feeling she lives vicariously through me and my long hair. 

She said it would be very insensitive of me to shave my head because it would remind her too much of her chemo experience. She told me it was very selfish of me to make such a superficial decision when it would impact on her so much. I knew she had bad memories associated with this sort of thing, but I didn't realise how intense her reaction would be. In the past she has made comments around actresses shaving their heads to the tune of ""why on earth would they do that to themselves"" but I thought it would be different if it was her child.

The hope was always that he would go get sober and get into therapy, and he recently contacted me saying he was both sober now and in therapy. He said he was ready to get into relationship therapy and do the work. I've asked people in his life if those things were true and they said it was. 

The last huge issue in our relationship was that for awhile he was constantly in contact with his ex. I didn't care until instead of solving issues at home, he would run to complain about me to his ex. I asked if I could see their conversations and he ran to delete everything. I accused him of cheating and hiding things, which led to my final decision to leave. He promised me recently that they were no longer in any contact and they had not been for 8 months. He told me I was always welcome to check because he understands he broke a lot of trust and wants to rebuild it. So like I asked others in his life about sobriety, I knew her a bit (or thought I did) from college. I sent her a message asking when the last time they spoke was. 

She didn't respond to my question. She immediately started telling me that what I'm doing is ""f*cked up,"" and that I need ""to get help."" I tried to remain as calm and kind as possible. We once spoke about both being pagan so I tried to make a joke about it to lighten the mood. I wasn't trying to grill or threaten her, I just wanted to know if I was being told the truth from my husband. She called me a ""stranger"" and told me I was ""harassing her."" I literally looked up the definition of harrassment, and it is definitely not contacting someone to ask them something. I stopped responding to her because it was clear I wasn't getting an answer. She spammed me how I was harassing her and she is calling the cops on me. I blocked her and then my husband called me asking why I was harassing his ex. He was telling me she was blowing up his phone from an unknown number. It started a huge fight.

He seems to have changed his mind today but the fight was so bad and it has me second-guessing everything. I don't feel like contacting another woman whose been constantly forcing her way into my marriage to ask what's going on is harrassment, but she was so vicious to me and the fight has made me feel like maybe I did some huge mistake.

I invited my friend from out of state to visit me. I have 2 toddlers and live in a state where marijuana is not legal recreationally. 

She said she (and her boyfriend) would come. I did not invite this boyfriend but didn’t explicitly say he couldn’t come. I have spent very very little time with him. I’m generally uncomfortable with him coming but that was exacerbated when I learned he’s totally dependent on weed. 

My husband went to dinner with them and the boyfriend said he wanted to mail weed to our house to have it for their visit. My husband said no lol. And then the boyfriend went on and on about how he used to smoke 10 bowls a day but now cut back to 6-7. 

Frankly I’m very uncomfortable now with the idea of him coming but I don’t want to offend our friend. My husband sent her a text tonight saying we don’t like people drinking or smoking around our young children. Especially because it’s so illegal in my state and my husband has a job with a security clearance so we really just cannot be associated. 

I dont really have a problem with people who smoke in general, but I just feel it’s bold to assume you can smoke while staying at my house. And the comment me made about mailing it to my house really freaked me out. So AITA for saying no weed here? 



Editing to add: sorry I don’t mean smoking it literally inside my house. I don’t want it outside either, or vaping lol. I’m just uncomfortable with the idea of drugs in my house (I don’t care what other people do, I don’t really have anything against weed. this is just my preference for my house, we don’t smoke or drink) and the idea of  high people being around my children freaks me out.

135,1e0gmoq,AITA for not going home for winter break,"My mom and her husband planned a trip to Jamaica from December 14th to the 21st for my mom's bday. I found out about it when they were watching updates about a recent hurricane affecting Jamaica, our family's homeland. They explained they had already booked the trip and would be back in time for Christmas.

I was upset because they hadn't asked about my availability and I couldn't leave until the 16th due to my university job. They dismissed asking about schedules as too complicated. Then, my mom's husband asked if I would invite them on a vacation with my hypothetical future husband, to which I said no. This led me to rant about booking my own trip to visit my older sister (34) in Nevada from December 16th to the 21st.

A couple of days later, I found myself yelling at my mom, calling her rude for not discussing the vacation plans with me beforehand. My stepdad joined in, calling me entitled because my mom covers my college expenses and now I wanted to go on their vacation too. He emphasized that he owed me nothing and vice versa. My mom didn't intervene in the argument. Overwhelmed with emotions, I ended up crying and retreated to the bathroom.

My sister came to my defense, but my stepdad insisted I was an adult who could speak for myself. Then my mom tried to hug me with open arms and a smile and I angrily yelled at her to get away. Feeling overwhelmed, I left the house and returned to my college town. Later, I learned my mom's husband was surprised by my departure, checking with my sister if I had really left, to which she confirmed.

On my way to my college town, I ignored a call from my mom and instead texted her hurtful accusations, referencing her lack of action when her ex-husband verbally abused me in her presence. Upon arriving, I wrote a lengthy note expressing my decision to cut off contact with my mom. In the note, I detailed instances where I felt belittled, ignored, or invalidated by her actions. I sent the note to my stepdad and my sister, and he showed my mom but opted not to get involved in the family drama, stating he wasn't my dad.

After a few days, I calmed down and decided to call my mom. When she answered the call, she asked who is this. I asked if she wanted to discuss what had happened over the weekend, she said yes. I tried to explain that while I understood her and her husband's perspective, I was still hurt by the situation. Talking about my emotional connection to Jamaica, understanding that the trip was booked before Christmas b/c my stepbrother (32) couldn't afford the trip and that I was angry that she allowed her husband to label me entitled. I pointed out that my university education and job fully funded my coursework, contrary to his implication. She remained silent throughout my explanation.

I asked if she had anything to say or any comments about what had happened. She replied with a simple no. We said goodbye and ended the call.

Edit: Thank you for the comments. I've been talking to family and friends about this situation, and their reactions to how I supposed made me feel like something was missing. It is obvious that I was the asshole in the situation (duh), but I now understand why I reacted so disproportionately to the whole thing. I am going to apologize, however, I will still cut off my mom due to the reasons I listed in the note as well as I think there is a larger pattern that triggered me to act like this unrelated to the vacation.

Edit: Thank you for the comments. I've been talking to family and friends about this situation, and their reactions to how I supposed made me feel like something was missing. It is obvious that I was the asshole in the situation (duh), but I now understand why I reacted so disproportionately to the whole thing. I am going to apologize, however, I will still cut off my mom due to the reasons I listed in the note as well as I think there is a larger pattern that triggered me to act like this unrelated to the vacation. Thank you for your comments and honesty, and I will still be reading people's opinions as it's helpful.",1.0,1.0659805536270142,1,1
136,1e0gh2v,WIBTA for purposefully losing contact with my brother?,"Writing this on a phone, so please forgive any errors/lack of clarity. This is 10 years of stuff, and I have tried to condense it to be understood. Feel free to ask for clarity/extra info if needed.

I (24f) have a brother (27m), who I used to be very close to. We started growing apart when my brother met his wife (27f) in high school.

At first, I really liked SIL - I thought she was sweet, and we both had a love for fantasy books. But she never seemed to like me, despite my brother claiming otherwise. Throughout their time dating, and into the first couple years of their marriage, she hardly acknowledged me. If we sat next to each other, she would turn her back to me. If she, my brother, and I were together someplace, she would focus on him. If she, my brother, her sister, and I were someplace, she would evenly split her focus between her sister and my brother.

This feeling only solidified when I was at her bridal party. I wrote her a heartfelt card, saying how thrilled I was that my brother was marrying her, who I couldn’t wait to finally have a sister, and that I really looked forward to developing a sisterly relationship with her. She gave a ‘hm’, closed the card, set it aside, and moved onto another present. She never looked at me once, and I was heartbroken. I was 17 at the time, and while I realize now how that could be seen as inappropriate, I truly did have the best of intentions.

I vented to my mom about this and SIL’s ignoring me, and she would say ‘SIL’s just shy, and an introvert’ - like, so am I? Yet I’m trying and she’s still ignoring me? That is literally no excuse? My mom grew apart from her brothers, and I think she’s trying to prevent that from happening to me.

I told my brother about her ignoring me/sitting with her back to me, and he told me that she ‘had bad eyesight’ - despite me insisting that body language had nothing to do with vision. I didn’t bring it up again, but he knows I’m not comfortable with her. Only recently has my brother said SIL wants to have a relationship with me (pretty sure it’s because I’m now ‘good enough’ to be a sister to her), and he talks about me being friends with SIL’s sister - and I vehemently refused that bit. As for the relationship with SIL, I think it’s too little too late.

I know full well that the relationship between siblings changes after siblings get married, and I hold no resentment toward it. I’m simply worn from feeling like I’m never enough to warrant a simple ‘hello’ from my brother’s wife.

I still like my brother, but I know they are a joint pair now, and it would be rude to exclude his wife.

My mom wants me to continue contact with them, and has told me that she thought I was an AH for not trying harder and giving back the treatment my brother’s wife gave me - they ARE family after all.

For example, we both vape and whenever they lose theirs, they just reach over to take mine from my hand without asking. They think I over-react when I tighten my grip and don’t give it up willingly due to growing up with a bunch of siblings and having to “fight” for my things, but I just think it’s rude to forcibly take something without asking. I’ve told them multiple times that if they ask, I’ll happily give whatever it is over, but that trying to take something out of my hands without permission messes with my bodily autonomy.

138,1e0gcun,AITA for refusing to go to a great aunts funeral?,"Looking for some input here. I'll type the scenario and my mental health and experience past few months leading up to the funeral.

Background, My great aunt passed away recently. She was nice to my grandma when her husband(Great aunt's brother passed away. Apparently she checked up on her and called her from time to time to see how she was.

I met her maybe 5-6 times in my entire life. Her children are 20+ years older with little to no contact with me.

Half haven't spoken in 8 years , other half 12 years or more, even though we live in the same city. My sister and rest of my family is going. My mom doesn't want me to go because of my mental health and a few paranormal experiences 60 days leading up to this.

Background

Anxiety disorder and sleep issues- I've also have in the past two years experienced

1. two suicides

2)Loss of a best friend

3)Psychedelic experience where I remember childhood trauma as a kid as I blocked it from my mind

Fast forward to April this year

1)Dead grandma visits me and I'm over whelmed from the experience and mentions facts I asked my mom about and she was surprised how I knew

2) two weeks later a dream with details unknown to me about a best friends deceased grandfather without meeting him once at all. Best Friend is in shock how I knew and believed his grandpa visited me in a dream.

3) A encounter with a man who looked exactly like the Grandfather(Great aunts brother). It was a real person and confirmed with a witness. He spoke about things I needed to hear at that time. It was as if he was waiting for me at a bakery. Turns out his name didn't check out he didn't live in the retirement home he claimed to live in.

From 1)dead grandma to 3)Grandpa clone I had a fear of dying every night before I went to sleep until I met the Grandpa clone. I also went to a therapist with it. The great aunt dies 13 days later from the encounter.

I am afraid if I go I may loose it and freak out as I almost had a psychotic break last December and had thoughts of deleting months after the psychedelic experience revealing suppressed childhood trauma.. My concern is that I am not in the mental state to go and I simply said I cannot make it as I have work which I sorta do.

Towards the end of high school, she all of a sudden began to only be concerned about popularity and getting in with 'it group' so naturally we sort of drifted away.  Fast forward we both go abroad to University  and occasionally see each other over school breaks.  She began one by one having a a falling out with each and every one of her friends from our hometown until eventually I was seemingly her only friend left to hang out with over school breaks.  She would often pick fights over nothing which led to a lot of broken relationships.

One day her and i had an argument because she was basically demanding I pick a side in a fight she was in with one of my best friends (AKA the one who picked me up when she basically left me for dead in high school for the popular group.) I refused to take sides when in all honesty, I was on my other friends side but just didn't want to cause an argument.  She got fed up and decided she wanted a break from me for the entire summer.

I say yes thinking that we are just gonna move on from whatever happened before between us and start new- NOPE.

He was super healthy as well so this came as a shock to everyone. However, after several surgeries and many months of treatment, my brother is completely healthy again and the doctors have given him an excellent prognosis to the point where his lifespan won't be affected at all.

To put it lightly, our family has been through a lot. However, my brother is now marrying the love of his life and he is so happy. Our extended family has been supportive of us all during our lives and we always try to travel to celebrate significant milestone events in our lives. In addition, my brother actually rescheduled his wedding so that our extended family would be able to make it (which also cost him a decent amount of money).

They knew of this wedding almost a year in advance yet now they are canceling even after my brother moved the date. Understandably, my brother is upset because almost none of his guests from our family are coming.

Because I am so disgusted over what they have done, I have canceled my flight to my cousin's (37F) wedding and have made my intentions clear that I am not RSVPing.

my mom looked at it too, and eventually we had to ask her boyfriend, who's good with computers, to come look at it to try and fix it, and he said he would the next day.

my grandma, who works an office job, asked if she should talk to her IT guy, and i said it was alright and that she didnt have to since my moms boyfriend was coming over to look at it.

fast forward to the next day, and my grandma texts me while she's at work, asking about the computer. i answer the question, and remind her that she doesnt need to worry about it since moms boyfriend is coming over today.

she doesn't listen and continues to ask questions, which i answer, but i was starting to get a bit annoyed. i told her, again, that it was fine and that moms bf was coming over after he got off. she ignores me again and keeps asking questions. i give a ""YES"" to her question, and she says not to yell at her because she's only trying to help. 

my exact reply was this — ""grandma please stop, i already tried everything and still couldnt figure it out. mother tried looking at it too. moms bf is coming to look at it today because he said he knows what to do"". 

she proceeds to say ""fine. pardon me for trying to help"". she soon follows with ""BTW, saying 'please stop'is quite rude.  It's the equivalent of telling someone to shut up.  Maybe try,  that's okay,  I got it"".

i asked her to explain how it was rude because that didnt make sense to me, and she said ""Basically saying that you don't care to hear what the other person is saying.  Especially when that person is genuinely trying to help.  It's hurtful.  It's better to say something kind,  that conveys the same message.  Like,  l appreciate your input,  but I think I got it. Or simply.  Thanks.""

im not even angry, just really confused... im not very good with recognizing tone through text messages. i was trying to be polite even after i told her multiple times that it was okay, and i figured saying ""please stop"" would be a way to get her to actually listen to what i was saying. am i the asshole here?? im sorry if this is a dumb and uninteresting post but i would love some feedback!! thank you for reading <3

I don't really believe in the religion and I thought I could just pretend I did until I could finally leave. I'm pretty sure my family has picked up on my hesitation but they would never admit it to themselves even though I make it pretty obvious.

They act like when I finally do them, it's because I chose to do it myself and not because they would ostracize me if I didn't.

Sometimes I feel guilty about my indifference/hatred(not really indifference considering how strongly I feel) towards my dad and I feel like I should forgive him for forcing the religion on me. When I was younger, it was easier to forgive him because I still idolized him, but he kept breaking my trust and my heart. I've stopped forgiving him  and he's realized that I don't love him anymore.

146,1e0fb8s,AITA for giving my brother a useless gift?,"I (23nb) (She/They) gifted my brother (18m) a Nintendo Switch. I thought that he would like it but apparently he did not. I gifted it to him because he is soon going away for college and he has said before that he can't play many games on his Mac laptop. And he does play a lot of Nintendo games, just not legally.

He says that it is a big responsibility for him to take care of such an expensive gift at his dorm, by the way he has an Apple Mac which is like five times the Switch's price and a phone which is twice the Switch's price, which I pointed out and he said that that was different.

He later called me in his room and locked door and sat me down and told me, ""I like your intentions but I am not going to take it with me. It is too big of a responsibility and you should have asked me before you bought it."" At which point I just replied that I gifted it to him and he could do whatever he wanted with it and left the room annoyed.

Later at night my mother told me that while she appreciated my intentions I should have given him something more useful and that I should return the Nintendo Switch and buy something more useful for him. At which point I just told her that somethings are not meant to be useful at all times, somethings are meant to be relaxing and supposed to be enjoyed without worrying about what one is learning for it.

When I told about all this to some people, they did say that I have wasted my money and it was an asshole move to expect him to enjoy the gift.

The thing is that I did ask him in a discreet way about whether he liked Nintendo games and whether he would ever buy a Nintendo and he did agree that he wanted to buy a Nintendo later in life and play games on it.

I also bought it because frankly I know what it was like to want to play games but not having a good enough laptop or console. Heck, I had to beg me father to buy one game CD which was like ₹100 (~$ 2) and even then he would make faces and get angry that I made him waste his money.

Well, I finally decided that I was no longer going to work in a place that is not good for me mentally & I’m going to start putting my mental health first. I received a job offer today & you would think that my mom would be happy for me (or something like that). But the first thing she said was “well, I hope they don’t fire you after 6 months for no reason”……what the actual f\*ck. Then she started saying that I should stay with my current job because I’ve been there for so long (9 years). I told her that it’s wearing me down mentally & like always she still wants me to stay there. But the thing is, she quit her last job before starting the one she has now due to it not being good for her mental health. If she can do that…..why can’t I?? If she can find a job that makes her happy……why can’t I??? This may be just me, but I think that she didn’t want me to accept the offer because that means that she now has to find someone else to pick up/watch my brother till she gets home. I’ve always considered her work schedule before I did anything. I always considered when my brother would need me before I did anything. I always put myself last.

148,1e0f40a,AITA for having boundaries on my belongings?,"18F, I’m going to keep this as vague as I can. Nobody in my household seems to take me seriously or care about my boundaries when I repeat myself over and over again about not wanting to share my things, especially with my younger sister (15F).
She’s been taking things from me for as long as I can remember but it has only started genuinely bothering me more when I was around her age, going through puberty and whatever else. It started with my video game accounts where she’d log into them, refusing to make her own account, and refusing to let me play on my own account. Then it started with a PC my dad got for me to do my schoolwork on (to this day she still plays on it regularly and gets extremely aggressive whenever anyone politely asks to use it). Now it’s been all of my clothes, my shoes, my makeup, my skincare, my expensive electronic devices and today, my hair care. I have curly hair, she does not. 
Today she went out swimming with her friends and took both my brand new tote bag and my hair cream and serums without asking and without letting me know, so when I finished my shower and couldn’t find the things I need for my hair to look somewhat nice, I obviously assume she took it and I got angry. She ignores my texts asking if she took my products so when she came back home, I confronted her about it she yells at me saying she needs the product too because the ends of her hair is wavy and she likes it, mind you I’ve had this hair cream for maybe less than a month and it’s already almost empty, and she didn’t even know it existed up until last week.
It’s gotten to the point where I want to keep all of my things that I do not want shared locked in their own room so that she has no access to them because no matter how many times I tell her to leave my stuff alone, she screams and gets mad at me for it and then gets my parents to make it seem like I’m making big problems from nothing. My dad talked to her about it but still ended up yelling at me saying I’m making problems out of nothing and that he grew up with 8 brothers who shared their toys and bikes together all the time. I called my mom to go tell her to leave my stuff alone like always but I know it’s going to end up the same way every single time, with her thinking I’m taking this too seriously and yelling at me instead for getting mad about it. 
I see it as a boundary not being respected but no one else in this house sees it that way and make me look selfish and bad. There is not a single thing of hers that I take from her, it’s unfair. My sister says she just borrows my things and “returns” them and because of that it’s not that big of a deal, but she never even bothered ASKING if she can use my stuff, and this isn’t just a one time use thing, this is every single day for every single thing I consider to be mine.

149,1e0exme,AITA for moving out and leaving my bro + his gf with the lease?,"Hey guys!!

First time poster, sorry in advance for the length of this NOVEL.

So me (31f) my partner (26m) and brother (26m) have lived together for the past four years, and obviously my brother and I grew up together. We have been living at our current rental for nearly three years. Back in January, bro took out a personal loan (15k AUD) to bring his internet gf (29f) here from overseas. Partner and I were on board originally because my brother is super isolated and we felt it would be good for him to have some companionship outside of just us.

But then the problems started. Gf has zero hygiene and really a bad relationship with food - which isn't an issue for my partner and I to tackle, but it's spilled into all our communal spaces. Rotten food left everywhere, loafs of bread left moldy for weeks, empty takeaway collecting eveywhere, the bathroom is frankly disgusting - I'll leave that to your imagination- and neither of them make any effort to share the housework.

We've had discussions with them and nothing's changing, and my brothers habits have deteoriated too. Plus the gf simply makes us super uncomfortable.

We've come to realise just how entitled bro is. One of their major gripes ATM is that we ""don't cook for them"", which ""forces them to buy takeaway"" so it's ""our fault they have no money"" (yes this is their words)

We've hit our limit and started looking for other houses, partly because I commute more than two hours both ways for my job, the problem is we'd leave bro and gf with the remainder of our lease which they cannot afford, and gf is on a study visa and they can't financially sustain her stay - she may be deported soon. They need another 14k by the end of next month and have no income. If she's kicked out, my brother's alone with 435aud/wk rent.

I asked ma for her advice and she sides with her golden child, brother. All along I've felt guilty thinking ""if this didn't bother me we wouldn't have a problem"", ""am I just making a big deal of this?"" My partner says I'm being dramatic (because I am dramatic lol) but he feels the same frustration and has had enough of making allowances. 

We discussed that we want to know about GFS enrolment, we want to know her study is secure enough to keep her from being deported, because we don't want to screw bro over by leaving him alone with rent, but we can't keep living with this tension. If she's staying, then we move out, if she's leaving, then we will stay.

SO idk man, I love my brother but this whole ordeal has really changed my opinion of him and really taken its toll on our relationship. I see him in a very different light now. I want peace, I want out, but I'm being told that moving out is going to destroy everything.

Tldr; brother moved his gf in and has made our lives hard, partner and I want to move out before the lease which will leave the other two financially responsible.

UPDATE: We had the discussion. I've left it feeling rather frustrated that nothing was achieved. Except we agreed to decline the house. I wasn't particularly happy about that choice, but my partner had changed his mind about moving (mainly so suddenly, as it effects his study and employment) which I respect and I accept the request to turn down the house for him. Not for the other two. Mum insisted on 'mediating' the discussion and there were a lot of double standards, and it ended up favoring bro. I feel like it was a lot of lip service from them, we brought up previous issues and we received the same responses- ""We feel like cleaning the house has fallen to us and we feel like we're not getting any help"" ""ok we will do more."" I've heard this before my dude, this is the third discussion, I don't have the faith left to believe it's going to change.

We did not get an answer about the study situation for the next six months. I'm still open to moving out if everything comes to a head again and nothing changes, and now we can give them more notice and my partner will have more time to work out his side of things if needed. 

HOWEVER I was reading over our lease and I've come to learn that we're actually in breach by having the gf stay here. We are not allowed to have occupants for longer than 15 days. There is all manner of consequence for this, from financial to a stain on our rental history all the way to her getting evicted- if the agent becomes aware of her residence here, she will need to apply through the usual channels, which includes an evaluation of her employment (10 hours a week) and her rental history (has none) as well as **our approval.** 

So in summary, we (moreso me as my partner was undecided) turned down the house and will remain in our current living arrangements. I feel like this is going to lead to more altercations and more tension and nothing has changed or will be resolved... I'm very frustrated, but I'm resigning myself to the attitude of ""tough it out"", as I've been told by everyone involved directly.

150,1e0ert6,AITA for missing my sister’s wedding after she scheduled it on a date she knew I might not make it?,"Sister and fiancé (both early 40’s) are getting married after many years of dating, first marriage for both, but they’ve been casual about this from the get-go. They decided to get married randomly after a conversation with friends prompted it, no proposal, wanted a courthouse ceremony and just a party with their friends.  Our family has blown this up a bit. It seems to be moving now more towards a backyard wedding with friends and family.\
\
Several months ago while they were discussing dates, my sister asked me what my availability was because I’m the only family that lives far away and I have 3 young kids, so I’m the most difficult to pin down. We talked through my schedule and I gave her dates that were kind of like “no”, “maybe”, and “yes, absolutely”. She said she was planning on those “yes” timeframes anyways so, awesome, this will be great.\
\
Save the dates go out via email a few weeks later, and she set a date that was on my “maybe” weekends. I call and ask what’s up, she said her and finance also kicked dates around with friends, and this was the one that seemed to work for them so… they decided to do that. The “maybe” reason for me was related to other travel I have already scheduled. Trying to get back to my hometown with my whole family is no longer an option, now it becomes only some of us go, and not others, or we fly out on different days… it’s a mess to navigate. She says “Hey it’s okay. I want you there, but I understand.” I talk to my spouse, we decide it’s too much to navigate, too expensive to make it work, we’re not going.My sister seems fine, she keeps downplaying mom & dad making a big deal out of this, says it’s not even a wedding… yada yada.\
\
I’m feeling okay but my siblings and my parents are absolutely ripping me to shreds over this. They are piling on the heaviest guilt trips, accusing me of not caring about family and shit like that. Like I should just cancel and eat the cost of other things I’ve already paid for (and can’t get refunded) and drop thousands of dollars to fly my family to this wedding that my sister scheduled to happen on a weekend when they knew I may not be able to attend.\

ETA INFO: I’m reading and trying to reply but there’s a lot here. I’m definitely taking away a lot of different things that happened here that might have made me the AH. The common question is “why did I say MAYBE if I had plans?” That’s valid criticism, but when I said we looked at dates, what I meant was more like general timeframes. It went like this: my sister says they want to do it before the weather cools down. This leaves us pretty much with July/Aug/Sept. I said hey July is absolutely nuts for us at work if you do it then we definitely can’t go. August, there’s some weeks that are better than others, it’s a toss up. September I’m wide open, zero conflicts. She had been saying Sept all along, that was THE month. We didn’t even talk about specific dates in Aug because she wasn’t indicating that was an option for her at that time. When I hung up I was entirely under the impression that it was going to be Sept and Aug wasn’t on the radar.\
\
I understand why some think I come across as being “judgy” about their wedding, or that I’m trying to make it seem unimportant. That’s really not how I feel. I’ve encouraged her from the start to block out all the family noise and just do what she wants. My dad tried to get her to change the date when I said my family couldn’t make it and I had to tell him to leave her alone and let her do what she wants. She’s been the one who didn’t want to call it a wedding, she didn’t like that it was turning into a bigger thing, told me many times they were just trying to make the parents happy by doing “a thing”. I’m certainly wondering now if she was being honest with me about the importance of it, and my being there, it’s possible she was just trying to not to put a guilt trip on me. She knows it costs a fortune for us to fly out, that it’s a full day of travel in each direction. It’s not some 2 hour direct cheap flight for a casual weekend trip.

151,1e0erfy,AITA for texting my ex for advice on my current relationship?,"
me my gf and some friends were out all day for the 4th of july. I admit I started to have maybe too many but long story short we began little bickering. We decided to end the night with the firework show just before it started me and my buddy decided to get a beer from the cooler, we walked off to the back of his truck while the girls found a spot. By the time we were walking back my gf was no where to be seen I turn around and I see her walking home! Turns out she got mad I went and got a beer and left her for like 5 min. By this time I was already fuming I relaxed a bit but didn’t chase after her. she missed the entire show and had me out there by myself she went home, I texted her as we watched fireworks and told her how childish she was being I was pretty angry at this point so yes I said she was being stupid which is not nice I know but come on now! I get back home while all our friends leave and that’s when a barrage of arguments started I tried with all my might not to lose my cool so I stopped saying things and she went into the bedroom I stayed out in the living room and chilled on the couch with a beer for a bit. She came out very angrily and told me to come to bed calling me an alcoholic for drinking another beer saying a bunch of things while I kinda just sat there shook my head and stared off I was so angry I just wanted to be alone for a bit… so about an hour passes and I decide to text my ex which is not good but her and I do not see each other in that way anymore in the slightest I really just wanted advice even after we broke up we stayed friends because we saw ourselves better that way than in a relationship and I decided to text her and not any of my friends or family because tbh I was embarrassed I was fighting with my gf when we look like a perfect couple but the fighting is constant. I fell asleep on the couch and got woken up at 1 am with a slap! she said let me see your phone well turns out she snooped on my mac book where all my texts get sent to. I hand her my phone she goes through my messages and slaps me again and storms into the bedroom and slams the door.my gf absolutely cannot stand that and forbid me from talking to her or she threatened to leave me. We even had another argument when I liked one of her posts on facebook(wasn’t even a slutty picture or anything it was her graduating college with her cap and gown I was genuinely happy for her) so she made me remove her from all social media and says she doesn’t like that says it’s not normal but I have no ill intent and are in good terms with her. she completely doesn’t understand being on good terms with an ex. I respected her feelings and cut her off completely whatever so I understand that and I do regret it for the reason that I knew how she felt about it but she says that I CHEATED by texting her. Am I in the wrong? Did I cheat? We are in the verge of breaking up.

153,1e0ed6q,AITA for refusing to answer questions about my store ,"Update 
So first thank you for the replies 
Second I apologize for not adding more details to begin with.  My original attempt had all details but apparently too many letters and got caught by the bot. I'll try and add more info. 

For those of you saying I'm TA because I'm not owed anything.  You're right.  I'm a very independent not entitled person.  I ask once and don't pressure people.  I'm not owed anything.  However people shouldn't commit to things that they don't intend to do.  And going by your same thought process wouldn't that make us all TA. Why is ok that my friends feel like our friendship is contingent on me giving them business information.  On a business that they are not at all involved in. My friendship to them has not been contingent on their participation in my business.  I still check up on them,  go to their events,  etc. 

As far as the refusals. 
Of the main two.  One says that she is not familiar enough with a couple of my specific products.  These are products that I sell to the public they aren't difficult to learn.  She just won't.  Though I've tried.  More importantly when I do events (art fair etc) she's willing to do those booths with the same products.  She just doesn't want to do them in the store.  It's not logical. 
The other one agreed before I even opened to help with grant writing etc something she is knowledgeable on and something that would save me many hours a week.  The two times I have asked in the last two months she has said she doesn't feel like it right now. Or she will say she's coming to the store to help that day then not show up.  That kind of thing.  



Bare with me I'm brand new here. This year I opened a store with a unique business model.  We are an Art and Gift Store that provides a place for people facing housing instability to make and sell their art. We also accept donations for resources(think clothing,  hygiene items,  etc)and offer those free to the community at all times.  Whatever comes into us goes right back to the community.  We live in a largish city with a high homeless population.  This kind of place is very needed. I see the impact we make every day.  It's literally life changing for some people.  
I am a single parent who doesn't receive any help.  I have a very very limited income.  I took a risk opening the store right now.  And because it's only been a couple of months am still working on getting the word out and gaining customers.  Part of the reason I felt like I could do it was friends supporting and encouraging me.  Promising me that they would help. 
What has actually happened is I'm not receiving any help.  A couple of my biggest encouragers have straight out told me they won't help now that we're open. 
I don't feel like I am asking too much.  I understand that not everyone can help financially.  But if you can't than help with time.  Ease my burden somewhere.  
They refuse.  And I understand that this is my project  but they knew before I jumped in that I was doing it with the understanding that they would help.  
Now I'm stuck in a bind. I don't have enough hours in the day.  I am trying to make products to sell,  get funding,  work a job so I can pay my bills,  parent,  etc. While in constant fear I'm going to lose the store for not being able to afford it.  People who have said they would help with grants etc haven't.  People who offered to help make things haven't.  
I know how important this space is.  They all do too. They tell me all the time.  But continue to refuse to help. 
I even just need temporary help while we spread the word.   
So I have stopped giving them updates. Example  If they see something I post on social media that's good like a magazine interview I had they ask questions.  I ignore them.  They ask what my plan is to not lose the store.  I don't answer.  
Now they have Decided I'm petty and have stopped including me in friend interactions.  AITA

155,1e0e4nd,AITA for telling my boyfriend he is being unfair about finances,"I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for six years. We currently live in a two bedroom apartment. He insisted we have two bedrooms for him to have a home office. I work outside of the home. We split rent 50/50 and he pays for electric and WiFi. I have about 75 grand in student loans that I pay about 1,000 dollars a month to and he has about 30 grand in student loans he pays a couple hundred to a month. He currently makes about 30% more than me plus commission.  He informed me that in order for us to get engaged,  I must formulate a plan to eliminate my debt. He also let me know that he expects us to contribute equally to any bills in the future (mortgage, savings, etc). For context, he just received over 50 grand in the month of June in commission. This is not typical for him he just had an outstanding month. I suggested an income based bill split to which he said absolutely not. 

Am I the asshole for feeling this scenario is not only not fair but also financially impossible? I make a salary of roughly 57,000 and he makes a base salary of 55,000 a year plus commission. Every time we discuss it he tells me my plans or ideas aren’t “a real plan” for example I suggested I consolidate my loans once my credit goes up a little bit to get a lower interest rate. He informed me since there is not a set date for this, it’s not a real plan. When I added that I can’t predict precisely how long it would take for my credit to raise to that level, he told me “that’s not true” 

Edit to add: Whenever I tell him I think this is not fair, he will tell me to “chill out” and “I should want more from life” I told him I love my life and I do not want him to want to change who I am in order to be with him. To be completely transparent, I can be at times not the most financially responsible. I live paycheck to paycheck where he does not. This is partially due to me wanting to do fun things sometimes such as go out with friends or grab dinner. Nothing too extravagant and all my bills get paid. However, I feel constantly criticized/judged whenever I do spend any money on something that doesn’t go towards savings or I just want to do something fun with our friends.

He informed me since there is not a set date for this, it’s not a real plan. When I added that I can’t predict precisely how long it would take for my credit to raise to that level, he told me “that’s not true” 

Edit to add: Whenever I tell him I think this is not fair, he will tell me to “chill out” and “I should want more from life” I told him I love my life and I do not want him to want to change who I am in order to be with him. To be completely transparent, I can be at times not the most financially responsible. I live paycheck to paycheck where he does not. This is partially due to me wanting to do fun things sometimes such as go out with friends or grab dinner. Nothing too extravagant and all my bills get paid. However, I feel constantly criticized/judged whenever I do spend any money on something that doesn’t go towards savings or I just want to do something fun with our friends.

156,1e0e3b6,AITA for giving the delivery driver our door code to our house?,"Hi! I (f21) have 9 roommates who are all my best friends, we live in a college house together but all have our own rooms. Our rooms all have door codes but we share the kitchen and bathrooms. All of us get along really well and are very close. We have rarely had disagreements before now.

In our college town, it is super safe. I know a lot of people who never lock their doors because they don’t need to. We lock our door, but I wouldn’t feel unsafe if we didn’t. 

Anyways, onto the issue. Tonight, I was too exhausted to get out of bed to make dinner and I planned on ordering Door Dash. I thought about it and since my room is the first by the front door, there was no reason I couldn’t just give the Dasher our front door code and have them bring it directly to my room. It is barely any extra work for them and would make it much easier on me because I wouldn’t have to get up and go get the food when it got here. I made sure to tip extra for them going out of their way to help me and put the drop off instructions and door code in the comments before ordering.

Anyways, flash forward to my food’s arrival. The Dasher comes in our house and gives me my food and leaves. It went just as smoothly as I expected. One of my roommates watched him leave and came in to ask me who he was.  I explained the situation to her and she became furious and started screaming at me. She said a lot of really hurtful things and told me she wished she didn’t live with someone who has no regard for other people. I always try to be nice and considerate to her and my other roommates and I also tipped the driver really well so I am kind of lost on how I was inconsiderate to either party. 

I feel like she is completely overreacting. It was another student who was our driver, we have cameras by our door, so many people don’t lock their doors and the man literally only came to my room, which means he didn’t step foot in any of the rest of the house or near her room. I literally told him in the comments only to go to my room and gave him my room number so he knew exactly where to go. She is acting like we don’t all have guests over sometimes or bring random men home we met at the bar. We all agreed we were fine with others bringing home drunk men we met at a bar, why is it worse when I let a sober one quickly come in to bring me food? It is my house just as much as it is hers so I think I have as much of a right to invite people in as my roommates do. I just don’t understand why she is acting like this is such a big deal and being so rude about it. I really can’t see why I would be wrong but wanted to get Reddit’s opinion because she is really insistent I was wrong. My other roommates are split. One of them texted and said it wasn’t a big deal but the others also feel I’m in the wrong. So AITA?

INFO: I don’t lock my door so he was able to just walk into my room himself and hand it to me, I didn’t have to get up.

UPDATE: Thank you for all of your honest feedback. Can’t say I appreciate people telling me my roommates should kick me out or not tell me the code, but I appreciate everyone explaining to me the stupidity of my actions. I understand why I was wrong now and have since apologized to my roommates. My roommate who yelled at me (Megan) and her best friend are still not speaking to me, even though I apologized and came around but everyone else is. Making one mistake shouldn’t be the end of a friendship so I am sure they will both come around. I think it was a lot harder to admit to myself I made a stupid mistake last night because I felt insecure when all my roommates turned on me. I am working on it. Megan called the landlord last night and had him come and change the code so that’s not a worry anymore. We also had a house wide meeting and have made a list of definite rules and things that need to be run by each other so something like this doesn’t happen in the future.

157,1e0dyyz,AITA for wanting my cousin to make a quilt for my baby?,"I (28F) am currently 7 months pregnant with my first child. My whole family was excited for me when I announced it and my grandma had promised to make a quilt for my baby. She was an avid crafter - she loved knitting, crochet, embroidery, and all kinds of sewing including quilting. Very sadly, my grandma suffered a major heart attack and passed away almost three months ago. 

Only a few weeks ago, I found out that all of her crafting supplies had been given to my younger cousin (21F). This wasn’t a surprise since this cousin, I’ll call her Bree, is as much of a crafting fanatic as our grandma. She learned a lot from her and they used to spend family gatherings together, sitting and working on their respective projects. 

My husband suggested that maybe Bree would be willing to finish the quilt our grandma had started to make. I called her and asked if she had the quilt-in-progress. She said she wasn’t sure where it might be - basically my uncles packed up grandma’s house and everything that looked craft-related got put in a box and given to Bree - and that she didn’t have time to look for it just then. 

I then asked her if she would be willing to finish it once she did find it, since I really wanted my baby to have something my grandma had at least partially made. She said she was sorry, but no, because she realistically wasn’t going to get around to it anytime soon. She’s doing summer courses so she can graduate college in December and she also has a part time job. The last thing she said though really stuck in my craw, which was along the lines of “and I don’t really feel like making a quilt, so it wouldn’t be enjoyable”. 

I let it go then, but I talked about it with my mom later about how irritating Bree’s answer was. I understand she has time constraints, but she still works on her hobbies, so it basically boils down to her not caring enough about me or my baby to do this for us. If our grandma could do it, why couldn’t she, you know? Mom agreed that she was rude and told her brother (Bree’s dad) about what she said and then the whole family knew and had opinions. 

Bree called me a couple days later saying that my behavior was childish and that it’s bad taste to complain about not receiving a gift. She said she found the fabric that grandma had intended to use for the quilt and it turns out she hadn’t even gotten started on it before she passed. I don’t know how to feel about this. I’m really sad that even if the quilt gets made somehow that none of it will be my grandma’s work. 

Now that we know grandma hadn’t started it, Bree’s convinced the family that I got everyone worked up over nothing and that I was the AH for being pushy about what would’ve been a gift. Even my mom, who initially agreed with me, now thinks I should’ve dropped it when Bree first said no and that I started family drama unnecessarily. My husband feels bad for suggesting it but also thinks my family is being fair weather. 

AITA?

Edit: I didn’t ask my mom to bring the family into this. Frankly, I don’t know why she went to her brother about it - Bree and her dad don’t get along very well, so it’s not like going to him was going to help the issue between me and Bree. 

For the people who suggested paying someone else to make the quilt, I appreciate the suggestion. It was something I had thought about before Bree told me that no work had been done on the quilt at all. 

My grandma was a fast quilter (yes, because she was retired) so when I asked Bree about finishing it, it was partly because I assumed there wouldn’t be much left to do. It was wrong of me to assume this, but that is the place I was coming from. ",Asshole,2024-07-11,"AITA for wanting my cousin to make a quilt for my baby?

158,1e0dk5t,AITA for being offended by my future FIL’s jokes and comments towards me?,"I’ve been with my partner for almost 6 years. We have a great relationship and recently got engaged. 
Over the time we’ve been in a relationship, his father has made comments and jokes towards me, often when others aren’t around or in crowded environments which come across as hurtful and condescending. For example; my partner and I play league ten pin bowling every week. His parents love coming down to watch him play. I play on a different team so they will come over and say hi and have a little chat between bowls. It’s nice. Last time they came to see us, my partner’s father came up to me while I was watching my team play and just say “not good” while looking at my team scores on the screen. When I asked him “what’s not good?” He just said “I’m only joking, only joking!” Without actually explaining what the joke was or what he meant. It made for a really awkward moment. 
Another time at bowling I was having a really great night and scored really really well. I was chatting to my team about how well we all went when my partners father came over and said “oh your scores really good! The other guy must have left!” Insinuating that it wasn’t me that got the good score, someone else scored that with my name against it. It was received as a poor joke at my expense.
Last year, my partner and I adopted our second rescue dog. We had already adopted our first one together 3 years earlier and had brought them both over to his parents’ house to introduce them. When I was chatting to his dad, he said to me “it’s really great that you have your own dog now”. I asked him what he meant by this, because he knew that we had adopted both dogs together as a couple. He just said “it’s just nice to see you have your own dog now”. Again, this made for a really awkward moment with me quite literally being lost for words.

159,1e0da3v,AITA that my gf booked a ticket for a vacation with her family and didn't involve me in the decision making process??,"My gf(F24) and I(M22) do long distance. She's been spending time with me for her summer break. Almost 2 months now.

When she came, we only booked a one way ticket as her schedule was not fixed (her program is unique) and we didn't know when she'd go back. So, to be able to spend maximum time together, we decided to wait until her program dates got finalized before we booked the ticket back.

She was also planning on visiting distant family in Oregon towards the end of her summer break after we spent time together, but couldn't book the tickets in advance for that for the same reason - her schedule wasn't fixed.

We decided that as soon as she knew her program schedule, we'd book the tickets back for her. 

One day she gets her schedule and books her Oregon tickets.

But, she never tells me. Not once does she even mention that she's received her final schedule and that she's booked her Oregon tickets.

As the end of her break is near (we didn't have exact dates but knew her break would end around the second week of July), I kept telling her how I was sad as she was going to have to leave soon.

I kept asking her when we can book the tickets for her to go home since we should book in advance or else it would be crazy expensive last minute, and since I am saving for a big purchase coming up soon (we split), I would like to spend the least amount possible, or if its going to be a large expense - re-budget.

I kept asking her and brining this up to her for about a week after which one day she suddenly tells me that she's booked her ticket to Oregon for xyz date.

Now she's saying that instead of a ticket home, we should just book a ticket straight to the airport from where she's going to fly to Oregon (which is in the state she's from) so she can spend the most time with me. So basically, she doesn't wanna go home first as we were planning, but straight to Oregon so she can spend the most time with me.

I said okay, but obviously wasn't enthusiastic to which she said, I'm being an asshole by not being excited for her trip with her family.

I'm happy for her, but I truly am not excited and here's why -

I was blindsided by her decision to leave on xyz date.

Since I'll be paying half for her ticket back home OR to the airport now, I feel that I should've been involved in the decision making process. At least I think I should've deserved - ""Hey, we're planning xyz date and it's going to cost this much"" - Is that okay ?

More than that, I had asked her to let me know when her schedule was finalized and still she didn't.

On top of that, I spent a whole week trying to ask her when she was planning to leave but in spite of knowing her ticket to Oregon was booked and she had a hard deadline to leave on xyz date, she didn't tell me.

She's saying I am overreacting and that she just ""forgot"" to tell me, but I am truly hurt. It feels like my feelings haven't been considered at all.

160,1e0d6ft,AITA for buying McDonalds for the kid who helped me work?,"I have a tenant who has 5 kids. She also moved in a baby daddy who's income is not calculated for Section 8 benefits as he isn't really supposed to be there. One of the kids is 12 and I will call him Sam. The guy my tenant moved in is not Sam's dad.  Every time I work at the house, such as when I remodeled both bathrooms at the tenant's request, Sam has hung out with me. He helps a little and he learns about the tools I am using. Sometimes he is a little annoying but he does help by doing things like handing me tools.   He always wants McDonalds for helping. Once in awhile I get it for him.

One of the kids destroyed a plaster wall and destroyed his bedroom door.  I have removed the plaster to the studs.  At the baby daddy's request, I have installed sheets of plywood in the walls so it will be easy to mount a TV.  I had outlets added and put one high for the TV.  I replaced a duct stack register vent too.  I will install a new solid wood door to replace the destroyed door.  The entire room will be painted.   I will not charge the tenant anything for these repairs.

Yesterday a kid kicked in another bedroom door completely off the hinges and broke the frame out of the wall.  That will cost $200 to fix and days to paint with primer and 2 coats.  At least I get rid of the hollow doors this way.

Sam has hung out with me all day today and helped by handing me tools and generally just being around. I cut my finger and he got me a bandaid within a minute.  That sort of thing.  He wanted McDonalds.  He asked his stepdad if he could go with me to get it but he was not allowed to go. He is never allowed to actually go with me except once.  Nothing about not getting it though and I have got it for him before.

I got him a big mac meal and brought it back.  As I was leaving, his stepdad is yelling at him.  Apparently, he didn't like that Sam got McDonalds and the other 4 kids didn't.  The other 4 kids were not helping and were mostly just screaming at their gaming computers the entire day.  Plus, one of these kids is actively kicking in the doors.

I don't think it is a good idea to punish a kid for working for something he wants and it certainly isn't a good idea to take away rewards that get a kid to work.

AITA for rewarding a kid who actually worked with me for 4 hours?

  
Edit: Sam said he didn't have breakfast and I was there over lunch time and I didn't see him eat anything. And he gave me a bottle of water.   Sam is pudgy though so he must be eating something.

He wanted McDonalds.  He asked his stepdad if he could go with me to get it but he was not allowed to go. He is never allowed to actually go with me except once.  Nothing about not getting it though and I have got it for him before.

I got him a big mac meal and brought it back.  As I was leaving, his stepdad is yelling at him.  Apparently, he didn't like that Sam got McDonalds and the other 4 kids didn't.  The other 4 kids were not helping and were mostly just screaming at their gaming computers the entire day.  Plus, one of these kids is actively kicking in the doors.

I don't think it is a good idea to punish a kid for working for something he wants and it certainly isn't a good idea to take away rewards that get a kid to work.

AITA for rewarding a kid who actually worked with me for 4 hours?

  
Edit: Sam said he didn't have breakfast and I was there over lunch time and I didn't see him eat anything. And he gave me a bottle of water.   Sam is pudgy though so he must be eating something.  Tomorrow is his birthday as well so I sprang for more McD than I normally would.",0.0,0.9802035689353943,1,0
161,1e0d2ha,AITA for cancelling on my friend visiting out of state after something his friend said,"My close friend who I’ve known a long time, probably 7 years, who I also share reciprocated, somewhat heavy romantic feelings for, moved out of state after high school. He’s back visiting and we had plans to spend the whole day together and he paid for a hotel for us to stay at. It was also just his birthday. We’ve both been really looking forward to these plans and spending time together and he flew a long ways and spent a lot of money to be here. 

Last night we were at his friend’s house after hanging out at the bar with a larger group of his friends. We’d all been sitting outside drinking and I get really tired and get up without saying anything to lay down on the couch and I end up falling asleep. My friend comes upstairs to say he’ll be back with a blanket for me. Some time goes by before I hear him and his friend come upstairs and whisper at length, I couldn’t quite make out what was being said but I did hear snippets and could make out that I was a topic of the conversation being had. 

He comes back and asks if I want to sleep in the friend’s bed and I say no I was comfortable on the couch, he asks are you sure and I say yes. The friend then goes upstairs and the guy I’ve been talking to stays on the couch with me. I asked them what they had been talking about and he gets defensive says “what did you have your ear pressed against the door?” as if they hadn’t been standing 3 feet away from me. He started to laugh and when I asked him what was funny he offhandedly mentions his friend had been pushing for him and I to have sex in the friends bed??? among some other weird stuff. He then said the friend had suggested “spitroasting” me. I shot up and said that is so weird and disrespectful to say, especially about someone asleep on the couch, and he started defending his friend saying he told him no and his friend didn’t mean anything by it and that hes a really sweet guy. I was pretty drunk and tired so I just brushed it off and went back to sleep. 

Next morning I left while everyone was sleeping not knowing how to feel about it, he texted me and said he got really drunk and doesn’t remember ever coming inside. I refreshed his memory about what had been said and he immediately apologized and said that it wasn’t okay and he’s sorry for making me uncomfortable, and that he talked to the friend and they’re sorry too.

I told him I didn’t want to be around him and don’t want to see him today. I feel bad because he had to coordinate his days with places to sleep and getting rides, and he spent money on this hotel specifically for me and blocked the day out for me. Not to mention he’s visiting out of state and I don’t know when he will be back.

Am I overreacting about the situation? Should I still make an attempt to see him before he leaves?

162,1e0cp11,AITA for trying to change my bf's cleaning habits?,"My bf and I have been together for over 3 years and living together for 1 year. We live together in a small apartment with our cat that we bought together. Obviously, my bf and I were raised very differently. I was raised as an only child in a middle-class family. He was raised by his single mother in a small house with his younger brother in a low-income household. The house he was raised in regularly had bugs, dishes piled high in the sink, an overflowing trashcan, and pet feces that were picked up with only a paper towel. Now, I am fully aware of the privilege I probably carry but I try to keep an open mind with my bf and acknowledge where he came from versus where I did.

The problem is that he does not clean up/do chores often enough. For example, he will often leave empty containers of things in cabinets instead of throwing them in the trash, letting food get old in the fridge, not vacuuming regularly, etc. I guess my biggest peeve is that he will almost never clean unless I tell him to, and even then he may forget. I absolutely do not want to tell him to do chores. I feel that if something is dirty, he should be able to recognize that on his own versus me having to tell him. I used to ask him to do the dishes or clean the litter box before I get back from my job but I was tired of giving him things that need to be done. 

We have had several conversations about this same issue before and we've worked through it. But his effort in cleaning always lessens after awhile. To clarify, I'm not someone who needs things spotless, but my expectation of a ""clean"" house is to not have dishes covering every inch of the counter and not having the trash piled so high the trashcan lid won't close. He will tell me that he's trying and I thank him when I do see him clean without me asking. But I am a bit fed up. I just think that there has to be a better way to find a compromise.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-11,"AITA for trying to change my bf's cleaning habits?

163,1e0cnz6,AITA My older brother asked my mom what I do around the house all day,"Throwaway account because my brother and uncle are reddit lurkers. 

My older brother (33M) asked my mother (61F) what I (30F) do around the house all day. My brother came over a few days ago to get some of his old stuff to sell. While I left to grab lunch for my mother and I, he asked her what I did all day. I work 40+ a week in the medical field. When I come home on worknights I like to relax but I help my mom with anything she needs, the main problem is that she doesn't ask for help, she just does whatever it is. She's older, had several replacements and has trouble walking. I wish she would let me do more but she loves her independence. I take care of our two dogs and two cats, I take out the trash, mow the yard, help with laundry. I paid for both of her recent surgeries, I also picked her up and made the house was comfortable for her.
About my brother, he married a woman who does not like to work and they have 3 kids. The kids are super sweet and I love them but I hate their mother. She belittles my brother and spends all his money. He does food delivery but only when he feels like it and thus never has stable income. He has begged everyone in the family for money many times. I have lent him far too much for too many years. I love my brother but he drains me whenever he's around. I've resolved to stop giving him money after he stole one of my mom's credit cards to buy his wife a designer purse for $900.
