1,1e14svn,AITA for talking badly about my mom when she was in the other room?,"This is hard to explain but long story short my sisters live with me. My mom has decided she can just show up and come in my house while I'm at work and do whatever she wants. She sets the AC blasting all day, steals my clothes, steals my food, uses my washig machine and just leaves stuff in it, and she doesn't help or contribute in return. She does sometimes let my dog out when she's there (which is a good thing) and sometimes she will buy things for my sisters and occasionally for me. But I can't afford the extra expenses that come from her bs

I came home from work and I lost my temper. The AC was set to 53 when i had set it to 74, she was wearing my clothes, and she had taken up on herself to cut up the watermelon I got as a gift from my aunt. I just lost it and went and found my sisters and questioned them, they took her side and insisted that they wanted the watermelon and couldn't ask me at work (they text me at work often) they also often set the AC lower. I was telling them that they need to communicate with me when they just blamed mom for it. I got even angrier because she has no right to ANYTHING in this house and started venting about her taking my clothes and that I struggle enough without her working her ass off to make life harder. Only then did I realize she was at the other end of the hall, holding a bag of takeout she got for my sisters. Instead of apologizing I just went to my room. 

I don't feel like I'm wrong. I'm the only one in my family who works, I'm the only one who pays the bills, and on top of other stressors I shouldn't have to constantly worry about my mom letting herself in and taking advantage and fucking shit up.

2,1e14ll1,AITA for not letting my gfs little brother beat me in a game 1v1 ,"

My girlfriend had brought up that her little brother (13) plays rocket league and that he‚Äôs really good at it so I made a joke saying that we should 1v1 since I use to play the game a bit myself. She took it serious and said that we should as she also thought it would be good bonding with her little brother as up until then I had no interactions with him and overall thought it would be nice to see, so I didn‚Äôt mind it at all.  The next day I (17) am on a call with her and she says her brother wants to play now so we set it up and then the kid starts trash talking  randomly and is just cursing at me out of nowhere which I hear as she‚Äôs talking to him separately, she starts laughing and all but does tell him to stop. So this was obviously weird as hell to hear as the negativity just caught me off guard as I got family his age who really wouldn‚Äôt act like that. Overall though I just decide to not go easy on the kid as I originally planned to due to all that. Match starts and I realize he ain‚Äôt too good so I win the game but still decide to be a good sport to the kid and say good game to him the worst I did was throw in a cheeky ‚Äúwhat a save‚Äù after my first goal but I did leave at that. She starts telling me that he‚Äôs really angry that he lost and is asking for a rematch. I accept the rematch and start playing normally again, she ask me to go easy on him so I let him get a point which is immediately met by the kid being toxic again in main chat. After seeing that I decide to not go easy on him anymore and win the 2nd game. She tells me that he‚Äôs really mad that he lost twice so I ask her to tell him to do another game where I‚Äôll actually let him win which he declines wanting to do. I offer up that we do duos and play together which he does accept. We play a few games and lose some but we end up on a winning streak and leave it there, he askes me to play another game but I tell him I‚Äôm getting off so at the end it all seemed pretty positive to me because I was a good sport about the wins to him and played some ranked games with him after managing to win with the him. Well, some time later she tells me that he was still upset  about the fact he lost the friendly game to me and that he doesn‚Äôt care too much about the ranked wins we had after and she‚Äôs annoyed at me for not letting him win. I try to explain to her that he was being really insulting for no reason and that it‚Äôs not good practice for me to just let him win after he did all that, well she responds to this insulted saying who am I to try teach her brother a lesson and that he‚Äôs a kid and I‚Äôm older than him so I should‚Äôve let him win regardless. I try explain to her my side but she just disagrees with me and is really annoyed at the fact that I didn‚Äôt let her brother win and she finds it immature of me and childish that I let the insults get to me and decide to not let him win.

I need some perspective. My dad and I both use each other‚Äôs cars for carpooling to work, alternating weekly. My car is new and still under warranty, so I don‚Äôt have maintenance costs right now. My dad‚Äôs car is older and no longer under warranty, so it needs regular maintenance like oil changes.

He wants us to split the maintenance costs 50/50 for both cars, but since my car is new and under warranty, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair. This has caused some tension between us.

4,1e1443m,AITA - offering to pay my teenaged stepson to clean the house regularly but he just moved in with us,"

I (36 F) have two kids (7F and 3M) with my husband (40 M). I'm an attorney. He's a stay at home dad. He has two other kids, my stepsons, 16 and 20. The 16 year old, ""Blake"", he didn't have contact with until 2 years ago. Since then we've had him stay for a couple holidays and several weeks each summer. He's been here a couple weeks  

At the end of last year, right before the end of school, he dropped out. 16 is the age our state requires. His mom doesn't care. He wants to move and stay with us. All parties are okay with this. He's had some trauma and I do think this could be a good thing. We're leaving it open and up to him if he stays. 

He says he's going to study for his GED.

He's our kid and a minor. He's not going to be expected to pay rent or for food or anything. He will have an allowance.

My husband is a stay at home dad, but he has a not great back, all three kids are autistic and our littlest has higher support needs. I work not quite as ridiculous hours as some attorneys but I'm drained at the end of the day. This has led to our house occasionally being a wreck. We've hired people to do deep cleans before but haven't found anyone that works consistently to do cleanings -we live in a kind of rural area and there aren't any big cleaning agencies. It's all just individual people.

Anyhow, I offered to pay him to clean the house regularly. I offered the going rate ($20/hr) but also with the expectation that it would be reasonably cleaned in a reasonable time. Like, I trust him, but he's a teenager.  I'm not out to screw him over. It's not required of him, but it gives him extra money. We agreed it's probably 4-5 hours a week of work. He seemed excited about it because he had a job in the school year in his hometown.

Anywho, I still feel like this is all reasonable, but I told some of my friends and two of them said I was an asshole for asking him even if I was offering to pay him because I was treating him like labor. My husband also doesn't love it (I discussed it with him first and he said it was up to B but he thought it was weird). 

I really thought it would be a good way to help out our WHOLE household with a cleaner house and give Blake the ability to earn reliable money when he wants to, but now I'm questioning I should have not and let him look for a job if he wanted (to be clear though, if he wants to do that instead or in addition he can. Or to not do either and just focus on his GED.) It's going to be adjustment for everyone of course, and I am worried I made a huge error.

5,1e13lvi,WIBTA for keeping my exes cat?,"Would I be the asshole for keeping my exes cat? 

A bit of background for this one. My ex and I adopted a cat together around April. We drove 2 hours to Sacramento in my car to pick her up from a friend of his who didn‚Äôt want the cat anymore. Hes always reffered to the cat as ‚Äúhis cat‚Äù and not ‚Äúour cat‚Äù. 
We recently broke up and I told him that I would be rehoming the cat if he didn‚Äôt take her, because my roommate dislikes the cat. I just didn‚Äôt want to have my exes cat, forcing us to keep in contact.
Anyways, he came to pick up the cat three days ago. I handed her to him at the door of my apartment, and handed him her litter box too (it had a handle).

He‚Äôs just not cut out to own a cat, and the fact that he didn‚Äôt even try to get ‚Äúhis‚Äù cat back after she ran away makes me uncomfortable with giving him the cat.
