1,1e14svn,AITA for talking badly about my mom when she was in the other room?,"This is hard to explain but long story short my sisters live with me. My mom has decided she can just show up and come in my house while I'm at work and do whatever she wants. She sets the AC blasting all day, steals my clothes, steals my food, uses my washig machine and just leaves stuff in it, and she doesn't help or contribute in return. She does sometimes let my dog out when she's there (which is a good thing) and sometimes she will buy things for my sisters and occasionally for me. But I can't afford the extra expenses that come from her bs

I came home from work and I lost my temper. The AC was set to 53 when i had set it to 74, she was wearing my clothes, and she had taken up on herself to cut up the watermelon I got as a gift from my aunt. I just lost it and went and found my sisters and questioned them, they took her side and insisted that they wanted the watermelon and couldn't ask me at work (they text me at work often) they also often set the AC lower. I was telling them that they need to communicate with me when they just blamed mom for it. I got even angrier because she has no right to ANYTHING in this house and started venting about her taking my clothes and that I struggle enough without her working her ass off to make life harder.

2,1e14ll1,AITA for not letting my gfs little brother beat me in a game 1v1 ,"

My girlfriend had brought up that her little brother (13) plays rocket league and that he‚Äôs really good at it so I made a joke saying that we should 1v1 since I use to play the game a bit myself. She took it serious and said that we should as she also thought it would be good bonding with her little brother as up until then I had no interactions with him and overall thought it would be nice to see, so I didn‚Äôt mind it at all.  The next day I (17) am on a call with her and she says her brother wants to play now so we set it up and then the kid starts trash talking  randomly and is just cursing at me out of nowhere which I hear as she‚Äôs talking to him separately, she starts laughing and all but does tell him to stop. So this was obviously weird as hell to hear as the negativity just caught me off guard as I got family his age who really wouldn‚Äôt act like that. Overall though I just decide to not go easy on the kid as I originally planned to due to all that. Match starts and I realize he ain‚Äôt too good so I win the game but still decide to be a good sport to the kid and say good game to him the worst I did was throw in a cheeky ‚Äúwhat a save‚Äù after my first goal but I did leave at that. She starts telling me that he‚Äôs really angry that he lost and is asking for a rematch. I accept the rematch and start playing normally again, she ask me to go easy on him so I let him get a point which is immediately met by the kid being toxic again in main chat. After seeing that I decide to not go easy on him anymore and win the 2nd game. She tells me that he‚Äôs really mad that he lost twice so I ask her to tell him to do another game where I‚Äôll actually let him win which he declines wanting to do.

4,1e1443m,AITA - offering to pay my teenaged stepson to clean the house regularly but he just moved in with us,"

I (36 F) have two kids (7F and 3M) with my husband (40 M). I'm an attorney. He's a stay at home dad. He has two other kids, my stepsons, 16 and 20. The 16 year old, ""Blake"", he didn't have contact with until 2 years ago. Since then we've had him stay for a couple holidays and several weeks each summer. He's been here a couple weeks  

At the end of last year, right before the end of school, he dropped out. 16 is the age our state requires. His mom doesn't care. He wants to move and stay with us. All parties are okay with this. He's had some trauma and I do think this could be a good thing. We're leaving it open and up to him if he stays. 

He says he's going to study for his GED.

He's our kid and a minor. He's not going to be expected to pay rent or for food or anything. He will have an allowance.

My husband is a stay at home dad, but he has a not great back, all three kids are autistic and our littlest has higher support needs. I work not quite as ridiculous hours as some attorneys but I'm drained at the end of the day. This has led to our house occasionally being a wreck. We've hired people to do deep cleans before but haven't found anyone that works consistently to do cleanings -we live in a kind of rural area and there aren't any big cleaning agencies. It's all just individual people.

Anyhow, I offered to pay him to clean the house regularly. I offered the going rate ($20/hr) but also with the expectation that it would be reasonably cleaned in a reasonable time. Like, I trust him, but he's a teenager.  I'm not out to screw him over. It's not required of him, but it gives him extra money. We agreed it's probably 4-5 hours a week of work. He seemed excited about it because he had a job in the school year in his hometown.

Anywho, I still feel like this is all reasonable, but I told some of my friends and two of them said I was an asshole for asking him even if I was offering to pay him because I was treating him like labor. My husband also doesn't love it (I discussed it with him first and he said it was up to B but he thought it was weird). 

I really thought it would be a good way to help out our WHOLE household with a cleaner house and give Blake the ability to earn reliable money when he wants to, but now I'm questioning I should have not and let him look for a job if he wanted (to be clear though, if he wants to do that instead or in addition he can. Or to not do either and just focus on his GED.) It's going to be adjustment for everyone of course, and I am worried I made a huge error.

6,1e1wh4v,AITA for snapping at trip mates on the sidewalk?,"

I (34f) have two young children and a disabled partner (42) that I care for. I also occasionally take weekend trips with some friends (42m, 41f) for a shared hobby. These are my weekends off, my me time, my sanity restore time. 

I noticed about a year ago that I was always the one booking accommodations, tasked with finding restaurants that could accommodate everyone‚Äôs dietary restrictions (even though I myself have none) and essentially doing all the trip planning right down to road trip music. (Not at my own insistence, I swear I‚Äôm not a control freak, but they both claim I should do it, always with the excuse of ‚Äúoh but you choose better‚Äù).

It‚Äôs exhausting. I feel like it‚Äôs not my vacation time, I‚Äôm just trading one family I have to manage for another. I‚Äôve talked to them about this on several occasions. They always apologize and promise they will do better. But here we are on another trip and both of them just stood there on the sidewalk and stared at me, literally asking ‚Äúwhere are we going to eat?‚Äù- I tried asking what they felt like eating, no opinion. What mood they were in? No answer. I‚Äôm just so tired of having to pry out information for their benefit. Once again, we‚Äôve talked about this and it always ends up the same.

8,1e1wb3s,AITA for going on vacation without one person of the group when she was dreaming about visiting the country? ,"Hi,

English is not my first language so, excuse any mistake. 

A, C and myself F-35

We are really close friends and often go on long week end together. 

A & C will be going on vacation in August when for X reasons, I could not. 

Many things changed in our life recently and we have realized C and myself that we had one common week free in July. It is raining here so we decided to book something last minute without knowing where to go. 

Before doing such, we asked A if she wanted to join but this was a hard no. No more days off and she will be already spending too much money for her vacation in August.

C and I looked for the cheapest option with sun and beach. 

The cheapest option was a country A would LOVE to go. Even if it's an adjacent country, we have never been there because it needs more than 2 weeks, rent a car...

C and I are just going in a resort and do things by foot. 100% farniente. 

So, when we told her, she got mad at us. She said she was pissed and she feels like this was done on purpose. She cannot go but she made us feel like for this country specifically, we should have asked or talked to her about it before deciding to go there.

On one side, I can completely understand the deception. On the other side, first, it's not because we are going now that we will never go again. Then, we didn't want to spend more money just to change the destination and please her when she is not even coming.

I just feel like her reaction is immature and she feels like we were inconsiderate. 

AITA for going on vacation without her? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-12,"AITA for going on vacation without one person of the group when she was dreaming about visiting the country?  Hi,

English is not my first language so, excuse any mistake. 

A, C and myself F-35

We are really close friends and often go on long week end together. 

A & C will be going on vacation in August when for X reasons, I could not. 

Many things changed in our life recently and we have realized C and myself that we had one common week free in July. It is raining here so we decided to book something last minute without knowing where to go. 

Before doing such, we asked A if she wanted to join but this was a hard no. No more days off and she will be already spending too much money for her vacation in August.

C and I looked for the cheapest option with sun and beach. 

The cheapest option was a country A would LOVE to go. Even if it's an adjacent country, we have never been there because it needs more than 2 weeks, rent a car...

C and I are just going in a resort and do things by foot. 100% farniente.

9,1e1vxrn,WIBTA for ending my relationship over outside circumstances?,"I need help navigating a rather complicated situation.

So me (36F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been together for 7 months. We are currently doing long distance, as I had to move back to Canada at the end of April, due to shitty circumstances out of my control. My boyfriend is currently living in Texas, which is where I‚Äôd lived for 10 years. The reason I had to move back to Canada was because my visa had expired in October 2023. I‚Äôd accidentally overstayed 6 months in the US and was technically illegal. My parents were the ones who‚Äôd discovered that when they were going through all our travel documents. Since I am blind and cannot read the printed documents, I had absolutely no idea that I‚Äôd overstayed. Me and my boyfriend were actually supposed to move in together later this year. We‚Äôd had it all planned out for months, but then my life unexpectedly flipped overnight and I lost everything. IDK if I‚Äôll be able to return to the US in the foreseeable future, given the circumstances in which I had to leave.

A lot of people had tried to tell me to just marry my boyfriend for a green card, and that seriously got on my nerves. I‚Äôm sure those people meant well, but alas, they didn‚Äôt understand the complexities of immigration. Marriage is not the answer to everything, despite what society thinks. It just goes to show how misinformation gets spread so quickly, especially in America. Me and my boyfriend are also super anti legal marriage, so this would‚Äôve gone against our beliefs and values.

I‚Äôd also heard horror stories from my fellow international students in grad school about how ICE actually has the authority to peep through your windows at all hours of the night, just to make sure that your marriage is legit. That‚Äôs creepy AF to me, and I would never dream of putting my boyfriend and his family in a position where their peace and privacy would be disturbed.

My boyfriend and his mom were also struggling to make ends meet. They could barely afford dog food some days, much less support a foreign spouse with a disability

I actually found out from a childhood friend of mine that even marriage doesn‚Äôt guarantee you anything permanent. My friend is Canadian and had married an American citizen in 2020. He was given a temporary green card when he married his wife. He was told that he‚Äôd have to wait for permanent residency, and that could take years. Sadly my friend‚Äôs marriage had ended in divorce 2 years later because his wife had cheated, so in the end he had no choice but to move back to Canada.

In any case, I‚Äôve always thought that the antiquated institution of legal marriage was a super scummy trap. The thought of being legally tied to somebody makes me physically sick. I refuse to be someone‚Äôs property, and I don‚Äôt want them to be mine either. We don‚Äôt need a piece of paper to legitimize our love and commitment. Furthermore, the sleezy government doesn‚Äôt need to know who I‚Äôm sleeping with.

¬†I‚Äôm scared that me and my boyfriend‚Äôs relationship might not be able to survive this. The thought of breaking up over outside circumstances makes me sick, but I don‚Äôt think it can be helped, given the situation. This was the unfortunate case of right guy, wrong time. My boyfriend is currently dealing with a complicated situation of his own and can‚Äôt leave the US for a while, so visits aren‚Äôt even an option for us right now.

So, would it be unfair to keep holding on to a relationship, given that our future has so many unknown variables? For the record, I am not interested seeing other people and neither is he. I‚Äôve had a few talks with his mom (which he doesn‚Äôt know about), and she said that he‚Äôs been really upset and depressed for the last few months. He and I have talked on the phone and facetimed since I‚Äôve been back in Canada, and it‚Äôs just so sad for both of us. At this point, we‚Äôre not sure when, or even if we will see each other again. His mom doesn‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs healthy for either of us to stay together right now, and honestly I get where she‚Äôs coming from. I seriously love this woman and consider her the mother I never had. Therefore, I have a lot of respect for her. I have a feeling that I will probably have to be the one to initiate the breakup.

The good news is that my boyfriend does want to move to Canada eventually, as he hates living in the US, especially Texas. Even though it‚Äôs not in the cards for him right now, perhaps it will be someday, but unfortunately that will be later rather than sooner.

We have one son together (he is 6 years old) and attends a summer program while we both work during the day. I was going to pay the weekly fee for the program, but when going through the transaction history, I noticed an odd payment. I confronted him about it and he explained it was for GameStop.

12,1e1vpcm,WIBTA for not going to the B-day of my father's partner?,"My dad's partner will be celebrating her birthday soon and I'm freaking out, I don't know what to do.

I've known my dad's partner for a long time and spent a lot of my childhood living together with them and my brothers. Note 'living together' as she always made it very clear that she wasn't our mom and didn't want to take any responsibility in that department. She wanted to be our 'fun aunt'. Our relationship is pretty strained for multiple reasons I will not go into, but it is important to know in this case that - in any situation - I do not feel safe saying no to her or to not exactly do what she wants me to, I know that she will blow up if I do and will guilt-trip me, I know that my dad will try to have a stern conversation with me. I also know that I still care for her very much and would be able to be there for her birthday.

However. 
She always likes to plan it big, and expects me to help drive at least one of my brothers (as they do not have a car). This is pretty tough for me (I am autistic, plus I have for the last 1-2 years been struggling with (autistic) burnout) but I try not to make a big deal out of it, since its her birthday, I should be able to be uncomfortable for 1 day to make her happiest that day. Plus, she doesn't believe I have autism or a burnout (yes, I do have a diagnosis).

For this year, she has now made it known that she wants us to go on a daytrip for her birthday to a location which (only for me) is on the other side of the country. Even better, to pick one of my brothers up I would have to make a detour of +1 hour extra. Then, there is a full day planned packed with surprises. Also difficult for me (as i said, autism), but I understand this happens a lot with bdays so I can deal with that part.

I have previously told her that I have kept this day free in my agenda to celebrate her bday. Again, I am definitely able to do that, just not this intense plan. In an ideal world, I would be able to visit her, I can give her a nice gift, we can have a nice time, at her house/mine/or even a restaurant that is not miles away from her house or smth, but I cannot stay a whole day packed with activities and no freedom (as I am also responsible then to drive at least one of my brothers home at the end of the day) to go home when I need to.

I am beating myself up for even thinking of this because I feel very selfish. She has this whole idea of her ideal day and I don't want to ruin it.

21,1e1ufp3,AITA for telling my Mom that I want to live alone in my appartment?,"

I (34F) recently had a significant argument with my mom (54F), which escalated unexpectedly. I'm the youngest in a typical middle-class Indian family of four, and my parents have always been overprotective due to my premature birth and frequent illnesses during childhood. This overprotection extended into my adolescence, limiting my social life and activities. Despite having a driver's license, I wasn't allowed to drive because my mom was too scared.

After completing my undergraduate and master's degrees, I was hastily married off in an arranged marriage at 25, right after finishing my master's. The marriage was abusive and short-lived, ending in divorce after 11 months. Although my parents supported me through the divorce, it heightened my mom's overprotectiveness. I continued my studies, moved to the US for a dual master's, and got a job, but my mom's anxiety persisted. She called me incessantly and pressured me to remarry.

In 2020, my mom had a heart attack, which intensified her pressure on me to ""settle down."" Reluctantly, I started meeting potential partners, but nothing clicked, leading to more pressure and eventually depression. In 2023, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. My sister stepped in, keeping my mom at bay and allowing me to focus on treatment. After chemo in the US, I returned to India for further treatment and was recently declared cancer-free.

My sister realized I wasn't ready for marriage and supported my desire to live alone, explore, travel, and pursue a PhD before settling down. We planned for me to stay in her apartment in Kochi, near my hospital, with my parents visiting every two weeks. Initially, my mom agreed, but once we settled in, she refused to leave, citing that she couldn't let me live alone. She constantly monitored me, rearranged my apartment without asking, and bought unnecessary furniture, cramming our space.

The situation worsened when my sister visited and confronted my mom about deviating from the plan and continuing to baby me. This led to a major argument, with my mom accusing me of betraying her love and creating a dramatic scene. It took hours to calm her down, leaving me feeling guilty and frustrated.

I (21 F) live in an apartment with my sister (19 F). I desperately needed a roommate to help pay rent after my bf moved out. My mom suggested my sister move in with me rather than stay in a dorm. She was in class and working, so she could pay rent, and it would only be a temporary situation.¬†

Long story short, a few weeks into living with me, my sister brought a cat into the apartment without permission. This cat was hostile towards my ESA (Sprinkle) and clawed my couch, so I told her she was not allowed to have that cat in my apartment. She called me unfair for being able to have a pet to which I told her I needed Sprinkle for my anxiety.

I told her she had 2 weeks to find a place for the cat to go and that he needed to stay in her room. My sister retaliated by getting him registered as an ESA. Idk how since, to my knowledge, my sister does not have mental health struggles. She said since they're both ESAs, we can ""compromise"" by keeping our cats in our rooms since ""we both need them.""

I was furious. Sprinkle already stayed in my room because my sister ""forgot"" to keep her door closed when she left so her cat would wander, clawing my couch and making it unsafe for my cat. I told her she had a few more days to relocate the cat. She did not, so I took matters into my own hands.

When she was in class, I got him into a carrier and brought him and his stuff to a friend‚Äôs. He offered to take care of him until my sister could move out. This was a good friend of mine and I had no doubt he would do his best to take care of him.

I'll admit, I should have told her ahead of time, but I was just so frustrated and knew she would try to stop me, so I didn't. My sister got back to the apartment and screamed at me for getting rid of her cat. I tried to explain that I didn't get rid of him just found him a temp home. She gave me a panic attack with the way she was shouting at me, claiming she would get the cops involved and how shitty a sister I was before storming out.

When I managed to calm down, I called my mom who had already heard from my sister, saying she was disappointed in me for not ""putting up with it for just a few more weeks"" until the summer semester ended and she could move out back to a dorm. My dad defended me, but still says that rehoming the cat without telling my sister was a shitty move, which I guess I agree with.¬†

My sister has not texted or tried to come back and it has been 2 hours. I want to stand my ground if she tries to bring the cat back, but I don't know if I can. Should I? Or do I accept that I'm the asshole here and just try and tolerate it for a few more weeks?

My sister got back to the apartment and screamed at me for getting rid of her cat. I tried to explain that I didn't get rid of him just found him a temp home. She gave me a panic attack with the way she was shouting at me, claiming she would get the cops involved and how shitty a sister I was before storming out.

When I managed to calm down, I called my mom who had already heard from my sister, saying she was disappointed in me for not ""putting up with it for just a few more weeks"" until the summer semester ended and she could move out back to a dorm. My dad defended me, but still says that rehoming the cat without telling my sister was a shitty move, which I guess I agree with.¬†

My sister has not texted or tried to come back and it has been 2 hours. I want to stand my ground if she tries to bring the cat back, but I don't know if I can. Should I? Or do I accept that I'm the asshole here and just try and tolerate it for a few more weeks?

24,1e1tvz6,WIBTA for kicking my mom out of our house?,"My parents were divorced 6 years ago and I allowed my mom to move in to a guest apartment in our basement because she had nowhere else to go without having to move out of state. She spent her life raising kids and didn't have work experience or any money. She did end up getting a job and working the last 6 years. She pays us enough to cover her utilities. The agreement was that she would live in the apartment while she figured out her next move and saved money. I have two siblings, one who lives out of state and one who lives in town, who provide no help or support to her.  

\*\*clarification: I have asked her to pay a small amount of rent over the years, and she has always said no, she can't afford to do that, but then she also travels a lot, goes out to eat several times a week, goes shopping with friends all the time, and seems to be living it up. 

I feel like an A\*\*H\*\*\* for asking my mom to move out. She has really spent a lot of time fixing up her space and making it perfect for her needs. She painted and got new furniture and made it really cute. She spends all her time there and seems happy and content. She planted a little terrace garden and spends her days chilling and traveling.

Despite her living downstairs, our relationship is pretty distant. She keeps to herself. Whenever we do hang out or have dinner, she makes weird comments about when I was a child, or talks down about my dad. Their divorce was bitter and terrible. She could have forced him to sell their house and split the cost, but instead she allowed him to buy her out of the house, which ended up being a terrible deal for her, since the house has tripled in value in the last 6 years.

The main issue is that my wife and I can‚Äôt afford our bills. We have discussed either renting out the apartment or living in it and renting out the bigger main house. My wife is going back to school soon and won‚Äôt be able to work, and we are helping our kids pay for college and other expenses, so we need to find a way to increase our income somehow, and this seems like one of the most sensible ways.

My mom doesn‚Äôt take change or boundary setting very well. Last time I asked her not to come in to our part of the house without first asking us (she comes in to pick up her mail, do laundry, etc.), because there had been a couple of awkward moments where she walked in on my wife and I snuggling or kissing, etc., she got really sad and upset and voiced that she felt uncared for and unloved. She did accept the boundary and doesn't stop in unannounced anymore.

We‚Äôve established that we both usually have two best friends at any given time: a formal best friend, and a functional best friend. She moved away for college in 2015 while I stayed in the area, but we‚Äôve been (formally) best friends since elementary school. It recently dawned on me that the majority of our friendship now has been long-distance. Considering that, we‚Äôve each usually had another best friend who lives nearby and plays a more active part in our daily lives. We‚Äôve still always said we‚Äôre best friends forever. Maybe that sounds childish, but it‚Äôs nice.

Anyway, I‚Äôve always just assumed that either I would be her maid of honor (for lack of a better word) or that her sister would. I remember she was devastated in high school when her sister got married and asked a friend instead of her (crazy‚Äîshe was a high schooler!), and I also felt hurt finding out she was planning to ask her sister instead of me (crazier‚Äîthat‚Äôs her sister!!) So I just always assumed she would ask one of us, and I planned to ask her.

Fast forward to now, she has flip-flopped for months about whether she‚Äôs going to have a bridal party, and been cagey with me about details. Early on, she told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt have to be a bridesmaid.‚Äù I was hurt, then realized we were on completely different pages.

We both served in the military so we both don‚Äôt take BS when we don‚Äôt need to. I usually handle bs by walking away until the tension is over while my mother leans toward the entitled side. Now for the story. My mother has been assisting me with my VA disability here and there when I have questions. Today I went to my consultation with a therapist. They asked the usual questions of what I was looking for and to send me to the right place. Pretty typical for a first appointment if I say so. That appointment took only 15 minutes. So I return home after the appointment and my mother asks me questions. 
Mom: What did you tell your therapist?

Me: Good morning to you too. We talked about where I will be going for my appointments. That was just a consultation. 

Mom: That‚Äôs not what I asked. What did she ask you? What did you tell her?

Me: I‚Äôm not telling you personal information no matter how you word it. 

Mom: You know what! I‚Äôm doing this for YOU! This doesn‚Äôt help me in the slightest. Keep treating me like this and I won‚Äôt help at all. 

Me: How is this information even for you? I don‚Äôt even let my friends know what goes on in my head. 

Mom: You know what, I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm going to write up a contract (yadda yadda garbage I walked away at this point)

So many hours later she‚Äôs still working on said contract that I‚Äôll have to sign. Which I will be petty and send it to my lawyers just to see if it is legal at this point. Unless the redditers of this great application make me believe I am the AH. I‚Äôll keep you updated

I‚Äôve made it very clear that I‚Äôm grateful for that help and I definitely would have been too proud to ask for it in the first place, which is probably why it‚Äôs taking me so long to find something better

I don‚Äôt like asking anyone for help, especially not my mother, we don‚Äôt exactly have the best history and I am much closer to my father.  My feelings towards my mother aren‚Äôt negative, more like neutral with a slight lean towards positive especially as I‚Äôve grown into myself and started seeing my parents as fellow adults as flawed as the rest of us 

My mother has been very constant in her communication about helping me, she definitely has control tendencies, and a lot of anxiety, but I do believe she wants the best for me and that it comes from a good place

She forwarded me earlier today an email response from a former colleague which included him instructing her to have me contact him with potential times to schedule a call.  Since she forwarded me this email, I contacted him to say it would be a privilege to connect, thanking him in advance for his time, and mentioning several times that could be a possibility.  I copied my mother on this email, and then I called her.

When she found out I had sent the email without discussing it with me first, she totally lost it [this would not be the first time].  She felt that this was overall aggressive and pushy and most importantly disrespectful towards her.  She accused me of USING her, and ended the call yelling F*** YOU and hung up on me.  I didn‚Äôt say much other than I‚Äôm not sure what the problem was here.  I can be a pretty distant and somewhat non-reactive person under stress, but those are separate issues.  I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to have gotten a word in because she was so agitated 

She then included my dad on an email that states: 

‚ÄúReading again my e mail to you that says clearly what to do- but no you just saw the opportunity and decided to use me 
So sad - this must stop‚Äù

Apparently, ‚Äúclearly what to do‚Äù was her telling me she hadn‚Äôt responded yet to his email, the email that asked her to have me reach out

I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm a Type A personality and I can err on the side of extremely action-oriented.  But I don‚Äôt think I deserved to be screamed at or cussed out via phone.  I definitely do not understand how my immediately reaching out was in any way disrespectful towards her

I think if I was somebody who used people I‚Äôd have a better position WELL before today.  Again, I really don‚Äôt like asking for help

So for background my ex and I dated for 3 years most of it long distance and he cheated on me multiple times and I took him back each time. After spending a month together in both of our states he goes home and less than a month goes by and he starts to act a little distant for a week and then he dumped me in a text without bothering to tell me why or what happened. I ended up getting different and conflicting answers. Anytime I‚Äôd try to find out from him he‚Äôd be mean and horrible to me, which led to me spiral into a depression and ended up stripping away my selfworth and my confidence. All of it left me a completely different person and not for the better.

It‚Äôs been a couple years now and he reached out to apologise a few months ago and I told him that I wasn‚Äôt over what happened between us and that it still affected me a lot.
Couple months goes by he tells me to add him on Snapchat, I did because Im curious and after some talking (barley any) he told me he wished he had pics of me saved, I asked him what kind, he said i was the best sex of his life and gave him the best head then he sent me videos of him and asked me to send some of myself. I told him that we‚Äôd never see each other so there‚Äôs no point, but he said he‚Äôs coming to my state soon and that he does once a year and we could be together.

Now I asked if he was single and he said yes, but since he‚Äôd cheated on me I asked again and he said basically single. He then deleted all of the videos and what he‚Äôd said. When I asked him to elaborate he said he does have a girlfriend and I asked him why he‚Äôd send me that and say that to me he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not married and life is short.‚Äù

I'm going to name the people involved in this after Red vs Blue characters because I'm a massive nerd. Sorry for formatting and spelling issues, I am on Mobile.

Last weekend I was on my shift it was quiet as any other day, due to my manager needing to drop something off for her kid I was the only person on shift. Around 2:30 in the afternoon Tex 24(F) a regular headed to the counter to put in her order.

Her order was larger than usual including a little cake instead of her typical medium coffee, I tried to start our usual small talk but she wasn't interested. Tex went to the bar, took a seat and took out her phone, after a few minutes her coffee was brewing I noticed a quiet voice, one I knew the instant I heard it... Grif, shifting my attention I looked around for him expecting to find him near the model kits or books. I didn't, I instead spotted him leaning on the bar next to Tex talking at her. I kept watching, it was clear to me she wasn't comfortable. I got an idea, I grabbed the smallest cup we had, filled it, wrote ""If he's bothering you take the lid off and I'll have him banned."" On the side with a marker, before striding over to Tex handing her the cup making sure the text was facing away from Grif.

""Here you go, fresh outta the pot."" I gave her a nod as I handed it to her.

She was confused, she then noticed the side of the cup, she looked like she had taken a swig of spoiled milk. Turning the cup to show him he looked offended, they then laughed. Tex explained to me that he was her date, not bothering her in the slightest but that I was. I quickly returned to the counter. I finished the order and called it, Grif came to the counter, taking the drink and cake along with two straws and forks.

He tried to start an interaction telling me RvB ended, but I shut it down telling him that I'd be busy for the foreseeable future. returned to Tex, I did my best to ignore them until they left but it was hard.

37,1e1srm7,AITAH For  refusing to forgive my sister and her terrible actions??,"This is going to be a bit hard to explain. I (25F) have a Younger sister (18F). Well call her Sarah. Sarah has a different father than i do but we share a mother. Her dad was never involved much after her first few years of life. Much of that had to do with the fact that Sarah's father once tried to take me and her from our mother(Our mom is amazing, Sarahs dad not so much). Luckily My father is very ""Persuasive"" and made sure he knew that would end badly for him.



My sister has always been babied due to various health issues throughout her life but she has been 100% healthy sense she was probably 14. I Understood that to a point but as the years continued my sister was babied to the point of serious attention seeking behavior becoming a constant for her. No matter where, no matter when. She had to be the center of attention. I reached my first breaking point when she was 15. I was 22 and had just had a medical procedure done that would have really hurt my family if they found out.



She overheard a conversation I had with my closest friend and found out what had happened. She then proceeded to tell anyone that would listen what I had been through and it quickly got back to my family. I was hurt and felt very violated. But I forgave her and slowly was able to rebuild the trust we had.



Sense then there have been a few other things she had done that really truly upset me but I just learned over the years what I could and couldn't trust her with and things where great. Fast forward to this year and we have grown closer than ever. I felt like I truly had a sister I could trust and confide in to a point.



I had recently been seeing someone Kevin (32M) for maybe three or four months and it ended abruptly. No big deal. At the same time it ended I had to have surgery and was stuck in bed for a few weeks after. My amazing sister was over every day to check on me, even staying with me most nights to make sure I was ok.



Come to find out while I was recovering my sweet sister was literally laying in bed next to me Sending nudes to this much older man Kevin and having chats about there ""Future sex life"" along with photos, videos, etc.



It absolutely broke my heart. Not only to know that this man is clearly a disgusting human in my book to be speaking to my young sister that way, but also to know that after everything we have been through and how long it took for me to trust her again. 



when I confronted her she acted like there was no issue in what she did. In her words, I was done with him so who cares. no apology, no remorse.



I know in my heart she will probably never see issue with her behavior because it has been allowed by my family for her whole life. And I F\*cking hate her for it.I hate that she has no regrets in the ways she hurt me and many other. She's my sister and i cant cut her off.

38,1e1sqee,AITA for refusing to help a friend who didn‚Äôt invite me to their wedding?,"For about 11 years now, I've (37M) been pretty close with \[let‚Äôs call him\] John (38M).

John and his partner \[let‚Äôs call her\] Jane (36F) have been together for about 8 years now, engaged for a little under 2 years, both with a child from previous relationships, so they have taken trips with their kids near-yearly, and I‚Äôve been happy to help visit John‚Äôs (now their) home and check on things, take care of their animals, etc while they're gone.  I‚Äôve helped them out with other projects/tasks over the years and most recently picked up Jane from the airport returning from a work-trip and got her home this past winter during a snowstorm because my vehicle could handle it.   Generally, I have been present and helpful on top of our base friendship.

About 5 weeks ago, I find out from a mutual friend their wedding is coming up, and invites went out a while ago, everyone in our circle but me invited. As a gay guy, I‚Äôve experienced being iced-out of some of my straight friends‚Äô lives and events in ways minor and pronounced, but this one has definitely been something that has had me thinking about my time and energy with people.  I decided I would take the hint and begin to distance myself.

John asks if I wouldn‚Äôt mind visiting like I have before to look after the animals and property, I said ‚Äúsorry, I can‚Äôt.‚Äù  He calls to talk about it.

My wife thinks if I go back that i will be choosing them over my family and not considering her and the difficulty of having to care for two kids by herself while I‚Äôm at work.

My reason for wanting to go back to my old station is that my captain there only has like 4 years left before he retires and I‚Äôve always told my wife that I wanted to work for him again before he retires. I also feel going back is a good career choice because I will be involved more in the tech team and have a higher chance of getting offered better units in the future.

40,1e1sk8d,AITAH for setting boundaries with my mother?,"I (26F) moved away from my family a few years ago to start a new life with my then boyfriend and put some distance between my family and I (they were controlling when I was growing up, and my mother has a history of manipulation). We are now married with a baby on the way.

This week is my due date, and my mother (46) has been calling me every day for updates and chats. The not okay part is that she has been trying to micromanage me from states away by reminding me every day to do things and scolding me when they don't get done. She has also told me that she feels like she is being replaced by my MIL.

I am very bad at having a back-bone. I was prepared say yes to all of her demands and just let it go. However, on Tuesday, when I didn't make certain phone calls that she had asked me to, she lost it, calling me a procrastinator, and told me if I didn't fix myself and get my life together I would start affecting my baby's life. I was stunned but didn't say anything.

After we got off the phone I cried. When my husband (34M) got home from work and I told him what she had said, he was furious. He wanted to call and tell her off but I begged him not to, as he was angry and it would make the whole situation worse. He told me if I didn't have a conversation with her about it this week he would make us all sit down together next week (they're coming to visit) and set some important boundaries.

On Wednesday I texted her, telling her that while I understood her anxiety of being away from her first born during her first pregnancy, we needed to relax with the constant reminders to do things and the anger when it wasn't done in a day. That I appreciate her so much for everything - the talks, check-ins, advice, and previous knowledge - but I'm not a child anymore and need to make my own mistakes in life.

She responded that she was sorry and that she was ""only trying to be there for me in some way"" and was ""only trying to help"". She also said that I didn't need to worry, she's ""still here and still coming next week."" I tried to continue the conversation but she didn't respond.

She hasn't willingly talked to me since - I called her yesterday to update her and her answers were short and we got off the phone fast. My sister (21F) - who lives with my parents - told me that she wouldn't talk to her or my dad the day that it happened, and she shut herself in her room and cried. She also didn't eat dinner.

My sister tells me that I should have just let it go like I always do, or at least waited until after the visit ""for the sake of the whole family"". She says that she knows I know how sensitive my mother is, and that even though what she said was wrong, I could have chosen my words better.

I understand how I may be the A-Hole, as I could have just let it go again with all of the effort she has been putting in lately.

So I went and looked. The sheets were still wrinkly and where they were tucked into the bottom of the bed, they draped over a bit. So I redid the sheets to make them look nice.

2:00 pm - I send Jess a text, having not heard from her all day, saying that I was almost ready and would be on time. No response. I figured that her phone died (which happens a lot) and that she‚Äôd text when she charged it.

She pondered the criticisms but ultimately decided it was none of our business and stayed with him, which we've all respected. In my opinion, his behavior has only gotten worse. She moved a couple of times in the past year, and he never helped her with any of it. He still doesn't really take her out on dates, doesn't cook for her, doesn't drive her anywhere, doesn't pay for her, etc. He always ALWAYS has to be the center of attention: We had her bridal shower a couple of weeks ago and he insisted on coming for the entire thing and opened all the gifts and cards (that we got for her) himself. My best friend has always talked about wanting a big wedding with all of her friends, but her fianc√© claims he has too much anxiety to say his vows in front of their friends, so they're only allowing family at the ceremony. So my friend can't have any of her friends as bridesmaids (her wedding party consists of her sisters and his sisters) BUT her fianc√© gets to have his best friend as his best man, since there's only two brothers in their families.

Is it my responsibility/ do I have a moral responsibility to tell her she deserves better? Or do I just let the wedding happen? The reason I'm so concerned is because she's so religious and I know she won't consider divorce as an option later in life.

And a year ago, he was willing to come with me. We both work from home so it doesn't affect him much. However, since the circumstances with his family has changed, he doesn't want to do it anymore. We've had multiple arguments about this and they usually end with him just saying ""let's do it, I'll go get my passport"" but then he doesn't go, and then the conversation comes up again and he says he doesn't want to go. His latest reason being that he doesn't want to leave his family. And me agreeing to be his wife was me coming to join his family. Which I don't disagree with, but I fell that that shouldn't mean that I give up on all the things that matter to me.

In our last argument about this, he said he'd rather I go alone and we can be apart for that year and maybe he'll come visit and he'll wait here for me. He hadn't given me a reason to doubt his faithfulness so that's not really my concern, but we haven't been apart for more than a month since we started dating.
I however, feel that I would really love for him to come with like we had originally planned. Because I don't want us to be apart. However, I also feel like I'm taking him away from his family at a time where they need him. After our last talk, he came to me and told me that we can go. But now, I feel unsure.
Specifically because of his family. The problem is that he is not even giving me a timeline that I could wait for him to get to a point where he thinks his family is stable and over grief. He says it can't be said, however, that's probably because he's also grieving. Please note, l'm not asking that we leave now, this would be next year feb. Which would be a year later after his fathers's passing. Am I being unfair?
He does a lot for his family, not just taking financial, but also with emotional support because they're quite close. His family are good people and they're not the ones asking him to not leave, they don't even know yet. It's just the weight of responsibility weighing on him. I don't know what to do.
",No A-holes here,2024-07-12,"AITA for asking my husband to move abroad with me? I 25F got married to my husband 27M earlier this year. About 3 months before that, my FIL died leaving my husband to be the head of the family as he is the first born son. Prior to all this happening, my husband and I had planned to relocate to a different country for a year. This was my idea. It's always been my dream to have the experience of living in a different country. I believe this to be one of the major things in my life that I place high value in. Before meeting my husband, and having grown from a disadvantaged family, there weren't that much possibility for me to take the opportunities that presented themselves.

Last weekend, I was looking forward to relaxing at home. I made it clear to my partner that I needed some quiet time to recharge. But on Saturday morning, they told me they had invited some friends over for a game night. I was frustrated because I had explicitly said I needed a calm weekend.

When the friends arrived, I was polite, but after an hour, I excused myself and went to our bedroom. I could hear them having fun, laughing loudly, and it was just too much. Eventually, I lost my patience, came out, and asked everyone to keep it down. The room got awkwardly quiet, and one of our friends said I was being a buzzkill. I snapped back that this was my home too and I needed some peace.

My partner was clearly embarrassed and after everyone left, we had a big argument. They said I overreacted and made them look bad in front of our friends. I feel like I was justified because I had asked for some quiet time and my needs were ignored.

47,1e1ruzf,AITA for telling my dad I am surprised he and my mom are still together,"I (27f) was having a conversation with my parents when a fight broke out between the two of them regarding an issue of communication. Basically my dad laughed at my mom and my mom got offended, so my dad told her he is sick of walking on egg shells around her. My mom then left the house to run an errand. I started talking to my dad and said that I am surprised that they haven't gotten divorced. 

He got very upset and called me ignorant and told me that my mindset was the reason I am still single.

The thing is, this isn't the first fight I have witnessed and I know it won't be the last. I have seen many as a kid growing up. My mother has threatend divorce before over a strong suspicion of my father cheating, something he still denies but she still believes that he did. Growing up, they never really seemed to spend time together. Any date nights were very rare, and they do not have much in common, so I have never really seen them bond over special interests. My dad is 67 while my mom is 50, so I believe the age gap doesn't help.

They fight about money, how they speak to each other, and really just life in general. 
My mother confides in me that she feels alone in her marriage and that my dad never wants to hang around her. My dad confides in me that he gets sick of her overreactions to things, so he is sick of talking to her about anything personal. 

They have had great times together too. Family vacations, and they both say they still love each other, but maybe I am ignorant in saying that overall, their relationship seems toxic.

I don't believe screaming matches solve things, and if that is the go to fighting resolution, nothing really gets fixed, it just gets forgotten and built upon.

I just don't understand how they can stay together after they both act like they barely like each other. My dad says I just dont understand love, but frankly love isn't enough for me to feel good in a relationship. Their idea of love ends in fighting, poor communication skills, and a lack of feeling secure on both ends. To me, it feels like they stay together for the security of being in the same routine for the past 20 something years. Divorce is hard, and I believe subconsciously, they stay together because they don't want to deal with it.

I texted her all that‚Äôs happening, and asked if I could call her. She replied 4 days later, saying she‚Äôll call me the next day as she was busy preparing for her entrance exams. All good here.

Tomorrow is her birthday, and this is probably petty, but I‚Äôm feeling hurt enough that I do not want to acknowledge it.

52,1e1r9xf,AITA for asking my mom to stop making backhanded jokes or comments about my relationship?,"Context: I (18M) have been dating my current gf (19f) for 7 months now and it is my first relationship. My mom was not thrilled about me getting in a relationship because she wants me to purely focus in school. Since my relationship has started, my mom has made comments or jokes that seemed to dig at my relationship/gf. For example, if my gf did something nice, my mom would just say, ‚ÄúOh, she is just trying to get me to like her.‚Äù It‚Äôs not the worst comment, but it was the tone my mom had that made me feel like she didn‚Äôt support me and my relationship, and that she was still upset that I‚Äôm dating someone. I had a conversation otp with her about 3 months into my relationship and told her I don‚Äôt appreciate some of the comments she makes and I would like for her to stop. Unfortunately, they did not stop. Recently though, we got into an argument over this because she was still making comments. I said I wanted her to stop joking and making comments which she was annoyed with. I reminded her of our phone call when I asked her to stop and she dismissed it as irrelevant because she did not remember. She said that I have made jokes about my sisters‚Äô relationships so I can‚Äôt have double standards. I sincerely apologized for any jokes I have made and said I will do my best to avoid that because I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone. I then asked my mom to do the same for me and she asked for an explanation of comments she has made in the past. I reminded her that the other day she made a comment about my struggles with being in a long-distance relationship for the summer. She had said ‚ÄúYou would never be able to go through what your father and I went through‚Äù, referring to his time in the Navy when he was deployed many times. This hurt because it once again felt like she was not supporting me. She immediately became defensive over this and told me she was just joking and I shouldn‚Äôt be bothered by it. I tried telling her that I didn‚Äôt need her to be defensive and that she was the one that wanted an example in the first place.

",Not the A-hole,2024-07-12,"AITA for asking my mom to stop making backhanded jokes or comments about my relationship? Context: I (18M) have been dating my current gf (19f) for 7 months now and it is my first relationship. My mom was not thrilled about me getting in a relationship because she wants me to purely focus in school. Since my relationship has started, my mom has made comments or jokes that seemed to dig at my relationship/gf. For example, if my gf did something nice, my mom would just say, ‚ÄúOh, she is just trying to get me to like her.‚Äù It‚Äôs not the worst comment, but it was the tone my mom had that made me feel like she didn‚Äôt support me and my relationship, and that she was still upset that I‚Äôm dating someone. I had a conversation otp with her about 3 months into my relationship and told her I don‚Äôt appreciate some of the comments she makes and I would like for her to stop. Unfortunately, they did not stop. Recently though, we got into an argument over this because she was still making comments. I said I wanted her to stop joking and making comments which she was annoyed with. I reminded her of our phone call when I asked her to stop and she dismissed it as irrelevant because she did not remember. She said that I have made jokes about my sisters‚Äô relationships so I can‚Äôt have double standards. I sincerely apologized for any jokes I have made and said I will do my best to avoid that because I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone. I then asked my mom to do the same for me and she asked for an explanation of comments she has made in the past. I reminded her that the other day she made a comment about my struggles with being in a long-distance relationship for the summer. She had said ‚ÄúYou would never be able to go through what your father and I went through‚Äù, referring to his time in the Navy when he was deployed many times. This hurt because it once again felt like she was not supporting me. She immediately became defensive over this and told me she was just joking and I shouldn‚Äôt be bothered by it. I tried telling her that I didn‚Äôt need her to be defensive and that she was the one that wanted an example in the first place. I told her that I felt like it is very fair for me to ask her to stop making jokes or comments and is something I shouldn‚Äôt have to fight for. She became more defensive saying she feels like she is walking on eggshells now and my request isn‚Äôt fair for her. She feels that I am being over dramatic and soft while I feel that she is not respecting/supporting me or my relationship. So, am I being dramatic a.k.a. TA?

53,1e1r93o,AITA for refusing to waive my alimony because my ex husband has cancer and can‚Äôt afford it? ,"My ex husband (56m) and I (52f) got divorced because of his infidelity. He married his affair partner. She was a prostitute 20 years younger than me.

As part of our prenuptial agreements, we had agreed I would receive alimony for being a a SAHM. I was a SAHM for my entire marriage. We had three daughters.

He never had a problem with paying alimony after our divorce. We had to be friendly to maintain a good coparenting relationship.

My daughters were very hurt in the beginning but learned to forgive my husband and his wife. They make TikToks with her all the time now.

He ended up getting cancer and because he became a big spender and had recently started his own business, the bills have been very hard on him.

He and his wife asked if I could waive my alimony payments at least for a little while so that he can pay for his cancer treatments.

I see no reason why they can't downgrade their quality of life. They live in a multi-million dollar house and his wife is decked out in designer clothes and has a face full of procedures.

I told them no and they have been pressing me to waive my alimony payments. They've even made my daughters bring it up. He's called me coldhearted and said he had been ""good to me"" and would have helped me out if I was going through a hard time. AITA?

My guy best friend is planning on proposing to my girl best friend in Hawaii next month. He has invited us to this proposal trip, thinking that we were going to be a part of the actual proposal since he has asked us to go all this way with him and plan the whole thing. We went as far as planning flights and hotels but not much information about the actual proposal‚Ä¶‚Ä¶until 2 days ago.

This is the reason why we will all come this way to see it happen in real life. Spend all this money, time, PTO, etc. 

So we confront him as to why this is.. and he tells me ‚Äúoh because you said sometime last year that you don‚Äôt want to be a part of it and you feel uncomfortable even though you know it‚Äôs a for sure yes ‚Äú. 

My mind went a million miles an hour because, first of all, I do not recall saying something like it and second, how stupid of me to plan my whole year around it, spend all this money for tickets and hotels and end up not going to the actual proposal and wait in the hotel? I helped him plan like going to certain beaches and I even said if I cannot make it to the whole trip, I will plan to arrive near your proposal date. I even offered to pay the photographer for them as an engagement gift. I went through scrolling from a year ago and it doesn‚Äôt indicate that I didn‚Äôt want to be in it and did not find evidence of this because he swore that I said it via text. This text is nonexistent. (He couldn‚Äôt find this either).

On top of that, even if I did say I don‚Äôt want to come, he assumed that my other friend who is attending is not going without checking with her. He assumed that because she might feel like she is a 3rd wheel so he just assumed she ain‚Äôt going. But never bothered checking with any of us since January leading up to 2 days ago. 

Now he is felling pretty messed up on the inside questioning everything. And I know he‚Äôs not this bad guy. I just feel like he missed the mark in so many ways and failed to communicate with us. He is asking us now, of course, that we are welcome to attend and he‚Äôll do anything to include us. But now, me and my other friend feel weird showing up knowing what happened and feels like he feels obligated inviting us. On our defense, he was okay of us not going in the first place. 

Am I the asshole for sticking to my idea of just not attending the actual proposal because he was ok with us not being there in the first place?

My wife has a soft spot for Ben and struggles to say no to him, so my concerns were dismissed and now Liv is living with us until they go back to school.  There have been a few issues that have come up since Liv came, pretty much all of which have to do with me.  

First, one of the big reasons Liv wanted to change her living situation is because her parents are alcoholics.  Now, I don't drink everyday but I do have alcohol in the house and I like to imbibe with a meal sometimes or have a few cocktails on weekends.  This is triggering for Liv to see a parent drinking with kids around.  

Second, Liv is vegan.  We eat a lot of meat in our house.  Pretty much every meal has a meat involved.  I also hunt, so we eat meat that I have harvested and I have a few mounts on the walls.  This makes Liv especially uncomfortable.  

Ben and Liv sat down with my wife and I this past weekend and offered some suggestions to help make Liv's time here easier.  Their first suggestion was that if I want to drink, I should do it in private and not around the kids.  I tried to interject when they suggested this, but they asked to let them finish before saying anything.  

Their next suggestion was to allow Liv to cook vegan meals for us so that we didn't eat so much meat all the time.  She offered to do grocery shopping and meal planning to provide vegan meals for us instead of our usual meals.  Finally, they asked if I could remove the mounts from the walls of the house until they go back to school in 6 weeks.  

When they finished, I asked if it was ok for me to talk now and they said yes.  I told them that my answer to all of their suggestions is ""no.""  I told them that I appreciate Liv's offer to cook for us and she is free to cook a few vegan meals for us during the week if she wants, but we are not going to completely change our diets for one person.  But as far as their other suggestions, not happening.  

My wife spoke up and said that maybe it wouldn't hurt to try their suggestions for a little bit and see how things go.  She said it's only 6-weeks and that changing our lifestyles a little bit for a short period wouldn't kill us.  

I told all 3 of them that if they want to change the way they live, they are free to do so.  But they are not going to force me to change the way I live in my own home for a temporary guest.  I told them if that means I cook separate meals for myself, so be it.  But the mounts stay and if I want a beer or a glass of wine, I'm going to have one.  

All 3 of them think I am being unreasonable and that they aren't asking too much of me for a short period of time.

61,1e1p8ca,WIBTA for going to a wedding party despite my mother's protests?,"Before I start, I want to say that I have contextual anxiety. The town I grew up in and spent time until university left me with bad memories of bullying, ostracism and isolation. In short, I have anxiety when going to social events in my town, especially because it is very small so you tend to see familiar faces

Until I went to the university in another city and made real friends and connections. It was wonderful and I really like that place, no anxiety and it's pleasant to me. I can meet and talk to people without feeling tense

In a few days, my friend from that city is making a wedding ceremony. And he has invited me. The only issue is that I have to drive like 70 Kilometers. Wouldn't be an issue for me because I have a car and I drove there countless of times.

Of course, my mother doesn't want me going and returning during the night time, which is inevitable because the wedding will be later on during the day and keeps making some weird excuses to convince me not to go.


I want to go, because I will have a lot of fun there, talking to people chatting etc. without feeling any anxiety. And also because I know that if I don't go, I am going to end up regretting it a lot. 

And also, I forgot to mention, I am 26. So no, I am not underage, I am an adult fully capable of making my own choices

62,1e1p3f6,AITA for planning to attend my friends wedding?,"
I met my best friend,A,in college 10 years ago.
 A grew up in a toxic family and I helped her any way I could during college(studying for exams, signing her into class etc)

I introduced A to my bf and would invite her to hang out with us and his friends. A Would get jealous if we hung out without her and wanted to be invited to every event, even double dates. A felt it was unfair for her not to be included because she was a friend of the group. I found out later that my bf's friends did not like A.

In our senior year A met her bf and became very distant and would go months without speaking to me. A was on and off with him .He was abusive. Whenever she called me asking for help, I would help because I understood she was  trapped in a cycle.

 A had to pick up 2 jobs, with overlapping schedules and wanted me to help her at her job. The job was new to me and I had a lot of questions. A did not train me well and often took hours to respond to time sensitive questions, or would not respond at all. 

A hired B, and we became friends. A began to get jealous of B and would remind me that I was HER best Friend not B‚Äôs.A did not like B due to how close we became and would not come to get togethers if B was there. I would reach out to A separately to hang out 1:1 and she would open it and not respond. We also had a group chat, And A began to ignore us there as well.

Eventually B quit. We stayed in touch and I now consider B a family friend 

I eventually quit too and before leaving, A mentioned wanting to throw a big 30th birthday party for herself and asked if I could save the date. I agreed. 

For my 30th, I decided on a small get together at my place where I invited both A and B. My cousin had just passed away so I wanted something small.B came, but A did not. A messaged me next day and said she was unable to come because she had to work.(which she later admitted was a lie)

After my birthday I reached out to A asking what the plan was for her bday. She opened the message but did not respond. 

Soon after, B shared that she was engaged. A saw and said  decided to give B another chance and wanted to plan an engagement dinner for her.

B shared with us during the dinner that her wedding date would be on the same date as  A‚Äôs birthday. B apologized to A because that was the only day that worked for her and the vendors.

During dinner A began to send me messages saying that B did it on purpose and that she would not forgive me if I chose To go to her wedding and continued to spam me for the next 2 days saying that i let her get between us and that I was not a good friend.
A said she felt second in my life and that my fiance, B and sister all came before her.

A also messaged B and told her that she felt they were in competition and that B was trying to push her out of the friend group and that B would have never met me if not for her.

When I asked one of my sisters, Kate 25F, she told me not to order until her boyfriend got home from work. I then had the idea to text him and then schedule a delivery for the time she said he told her he‚Äôd be home so then we‚Äôre not waiting extra time to have dinner since we were already delaying dinner to accommodate for her boyfriend who arrives home the latest out of everyone and then even later than that. When I texted him, I got no reply and when I came downstairs from my room at the time we agreed upon, he was sat watching the television. I asked him what he wanted from the chip shop and he said he already replied via my sister which I thought was a bit stupid since I was the one that texted him so why was he going through the effort to read my text, leave our messages and give an answer to my sister?

I then proceeded to tell my other sister‚Äôs boyfriend (in the same room) we were ordering food and asked what he‚Äôd like to order. He said he didn‚Äôt like anything. Because Kaye and her boyfriend were in the room as well, I thought me announcing I was ordering food and asking people their orders would prompt them to say what they wanted but they hadn‚Äôt and because I was pretty annoyed that Kyle (Kate‚Äôs boyfriend) was being weird and couldn‚Äôt respond to me directly, I couldn‚Äôt be asked to waste my time repeating the same question to them when we agreed we‚Äôd schedule it to come when he got home (something we now that ended up not doing) because he couldn‚Äôt directly respond to a simple text message. I then placed the order through for myself and my mother, when she asked what I ordered for Kate and Kyle, I said nothing because they had made no effort to communicate with me.

67,1e1oafp,AITA for telling a cop that someone was flagging down traffic?,"I (29F) was driving into work this morning, jamming out to some ADTR, windows down, enjoying the fact that it's Friday when I see a minivan pulled over but still blocking half of the exit ramp. I slowed down and scoched over onto the shoulder to safely pass and a man started waving his arms in the air and walking into the street. Pretty much to the point I had to swerve a little so I didn't hit him. He was screaming and then angrily flipped me off when I kept driving. 

Probably less than a quarter mile after that exit is a gas station with a big fancy car wash (my destination before work this morning because the birds did a number on my car). I pulled into the gas station to top off before washing my car and I was still a bit frazzled from the guy running into the road at me. When I walked inside there was a nice looking police officer in uniform buying his morning coffee. Generally I don't approach cops but that guy in the road worried me so I went up to the office and told him ""Excuse me sir, there's a man pulled over on the exit ramp trying to flag down traffic, if you're headed that direction, could you see if he needs assistance?"" 

The cop nodded and said sure his duty starts in 15 minutes so he will head that way after his breakfast. I was a bit muffed at that response, 15 minutes is a long time when it comes to being on the side of the road. But whatever, I reported it and it was no longer my problem. I went on with my plan to get my car washed. After making my baby shine, I pulled into a vaccume spot to get some sand out and the guy that was flagging me down comes around the corner screaming obscenities at me. Apparently he had followed me to the gas station on foot and wanted to tell me how much of a ""spoiled c*nt"" I was for leaving him ""stranded"".

The cop who was still eating his breakfast in his squad car saw this go down and came over to intervene. He ended up cuffing the man and putting him in the backseat after his de-escalation tactics didn't work. I was extra shaken. The cop took my statement then sent me on my way. 

When I got to work a few of the guys said I never should have told the cop. They jokingly started calling me a narc and saying ""only AHs would get cops involved in something so silly"". A few of them said I was dumb and should have just come to work and skipped the gas station and car wash all together. 

So Reddit, was I the AH? ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-12,"AITA for telling a cop that someone was flagging down traffic? I (29F) was driving into work this morning, jamming out to some ADTR, windows down, enjoying the fact that it's Friday when I see a minivan pulled over but still blocking half of the exit ramp. I slowed down and scoched over onto the shoulder to safely pass and a man started waving his arms in the air and walking into the street. Pretty much to the point I had to swerve a little so I didn't hit him. He was screaming and then angrily flipped me off when I kept driving. 

Probably less than a quarter mile after that exit is a gas station with a big fancy car wash (my destination before work this morning because the birds did a number on my car). I pulled into the gas station to top off before washing my car and I was still a bit frazzled from the guy running into the road at me. When I walked inside there was a nice looking police officer in uniform buying his morning coffee. Generally I don't approach cops but that guy in the road worried me so I went up to the office and told him ""Excuse me sir, there's a man pulled over on the exit ramp trying to flag down traffic, if you're headed that direction, could you see if he needs assistance?"" 

The cop nodded and said sure his duty starts in 15 minutes so he will head that way after his breakfast. I was a bit muffed at that response, 15 minutes is a long time when it comes to being on the side of the road. But whatever, I reported it and it was no longer my problem.

68,1e1o9fx,AITA for asking my roommate to tone down his adult activities around my kid?,"I (18F) got unwillingly pregnant at 15 and have a 2 yr old daughter. I‚Äôve been staying with my parents but they‚Äôd kicked me out and told me to find my own place for college. I‚Äôm studying at a community college now and temporarily staying at a mutual friend‚Äôs apartment as he lives near the campus.

My friend, who I‚Äôll call JM, has a bf who stays over basically 24/7. I didn‚Äôt mind this at first because I was on good terms with both of them but this is slowly turning into an issue, as JM and his bf like to go at it almost every night (especially after 12). My daughter gets woken up every time and it takes 1-2 hrs for me to put her back to bed as she keeps asking questions about the noises I‚Äôd rather not answer.

It‚Äôs been like this for a couple weeks now and is causing arguments between JM and I. He argues that this is his apartment I‚Äôm staying in rent free and they‚Äôve already stopped hooking up during the day out of respect for us. He says I should be grateful I‚Äôm doing anything at all as he already looks after my daughter when I‚Äôm on campus.

Both mine and my kid‚Äôs sleep cycles are getting disturbed by this. I have to wake up early for classes but he doesn‚Äôt even go to college and works from home later during the day. Plus, I don‚Äôt want her hearing those loud sexual noises at such a young age. AITA?

Edit: I am moving out within 2-3 weeks. I‚Äôm just in the process of finding a temporary solution to this issue. Some comments suggested I go for buying a white noise machine so I‚Äôm going for that. Gonna talk things out with and apologize to JM too

69,1e1o2j8,AITA for not paying my partner mortgage,"Hey everyone. This is a throwaway account. I just wanted to hear other people opinions on this. 


So my partner and I live together. I make around 50k a year. My partner makes around 150k or even more a year as he owns a business and it‚Äôs very successful and busy. 

My partner has multiple properties and we moved into one of this property together. When we moved in he told me If I could pay the bills. Which is hydro / groceries / internet. Which comes to be around 600-800 a month as we eat pretty healthy and I cook a lot of different meals. Not bad at all. I was living on my own before with a room mate. I paid 600 a month with my room mate.  But that‚Äôs not including food.  Which is probably 2 hundred more. My place was very small and I lived in a very old building. His place is very nice and new and spacious. 

Okay so the problem slowly starting coming after 2 year of dating. I cook and clean. He doesn‚Äôt do any of those stuff as I understand that he pays for the mortgage. He throws his stuff on ground like clothing / shoes etc and I have to pick up after him all the time. 

I have 2 jobs. I work in hospitality. And on my days off 1-2 times a week I work at his restaurant for few hours. He doesn‚Äôt want to hire because he said he gets free workers do why does he need to. Aka his parents/ siblings and me. He owns a fast food take out place. Not a big place. Only need one or two ppl working.  Sometimes I work as a delivery driver or a server. I don‚Äôt get paid anything. I just work to help. I get tips sometimes which is around 10-20$. 
I also run all his errands for him. Such as finding renters. Dealing with his rental properties. (Which is a lot of work) Or any kind of thing he needs I do it. Like dropping off cheques to his landlord for his store. Or anything he needs really. When we go on dates / dinner he pays most of the time. 80 percent of the time and I pay 20 percent of the time. 

Recently he bought a new car.  Luxury one worth over 100k. He now has two cars. Both  the luxury Mercedes /bmw  ones.  Which I‚Äôm not sure why anyone needs two cars. I don‚Äôt have a car and I walk everywhere. We live in downtown Vancouver so walking is fine for me. Anyways now he saying that he needs me to pay more stuff like contributing to his mortgage because he has so much bills etc. but i just feel like I already do so much and I pay some bills already. 
He said he‚Äôs so stress and he feels like I‚Äôm not helping him. 
  I understand that I only pay for grocery‚Äôs and bills but I work at his place for free and I also cook and clean after him and do all the assistant stuff. 

Anyways. I just want to understand if this is normal. The person I dated before didn‚Äôt let me pay for anything at all. No bills, rent or anything. I have realized now I was very spoiled by my ex. He didn‚Äôt let me pay even if we go to a resturant or date. So it‚Äôs hard for me to understand what is okay and what is not. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking or not and just want to hear others opinions.

79,1e1mhge,AITA For telling my wife that her daughter needs to get a new job or move out,"My wife (40F) and I (41M) have been married for 8 years and have 2 kids together (7 & 5).  My wife also has a daughter, Jess (21F) from when she was younger.  Jess is currently living with us this summer.  She finished her junior year of college but isn't sure she wants to go back. We asked her to at least take some time this summer to think about it because delaying going back will only make it harder.  The biggest condition on her staying with us is that if she isn't going back to school, she needs to be working and contributing to the household.  

She had a job waitressing for a month or so when she first moved back, but quit because of a toxic work environment.  A couple weeks later she said she got a new job but didn't tell us exactly what it was.  She told us she was working in retail.  She would leave during the day like she was working normal hours.  

One night last week, I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.  When I was walking down the hall, I saw light from under Jess's door and could hear her talking to someone.  It was like 3am so I knocked on the door and asked her if everything was ok.  It took her a few seconds but she told me she was fine so I went back to bed.  

I told my wife about it the next morning and she said she would talk to Jess to make sure everything was OK.  That night, I asked my wife if she talked to Jess and she told me that she did but she needs to talk to me about it.  Apparently, Jess has been doing Only Fans since she quit her waitressing job.  She admitted it to her mom because she didn't want to lie about having a job or for us to find out in different way.  

I pretty much immediately told my wife that Jess can't do that in our house.  We have 2 young kids and I don't want them around that.  My wife said that Jess only does it at night when everyone else is asleep.  She has apparently been leaving during the day and sleeping at a friend's house then staying up all night to ""work.""  

I told her that all it's going to take is for one of our kids to wake up and open Jess's door and that's not a risk I am willing to take.  I told her that I am not going to admonish Jess for what she chooses to do with her body, but I can't have our younger kids at risk to be exposed to that.  I told her that Jess is either going to need to find a new job or move out and ""work"" somewhere else.

She said she doesn't want Jess to move out and we can just talk to our younger kids about respecting Jess's privacy.

80,1e1mhft,AITA for not putting effort into my relationship with my father ,"I (23f) and my dad (46m) haven't had a good relationship since I was a kid. I always felt like he was closed off from everybody around him, and when I became a pre-teen we didn't talk much and hung out anymore, like when I was little.

A year ago me and my mom (46) found out he cheated on her with a girl my age, and the girl even was my classmate in highschool for a short amount of time.

Now, they are obviously going through a divorce and for personal reasons I had to move back in with my mom. The problem is, dad is really trying to have a better relationship with me, but I fear it's for selfish reasons. He always cries about how he has no family left anymore, since his mom is getting older and we only talk like once a week about the same few topics.

His relationship with my mom isn't even that bad, they're still on good terms and help out eachother whenever needed, and I feel our relationship is the same as it's always been. So it feels weird when he says he has lost everything. (He's still in an affair with the 23yo girlfriend, but she has a husband. Still they hang out almost every day.)

Now I'm not saying I want to cut him out of my life, he's still my father, and the person he wronged the most was mom. Plus he still helps me out financially since I'm currently looking for a job and I'm incredibly grateful for that.

I just feel like I don't have the energy to put in more effort into talking with him more, and hanging out after all these years of feeling ignored by him.

I usually don't get upset easily, but this time, given my state, I was genuinely irritated and asked her to stop and give me space.

When I went to grab the remote to press play, she kept jokingly telling me to pause and tried to get the remote from me. I tossed the remote toward my shoe to avoid her, but missed, and it hit the floor, making a noise. This seemed to trigger her fight-or-flight response, and she went stiff and ran to the bathroom, locking herself in. I asked if she was okay, but she told me to leave her alone.

Later, once she was calm, I apologized for triggering her, explaining that I didn‚Äôt mean be aggressive with the remote or upset her‚Äîjust trying to joke around. She said it was okay and we went to sleep.

She then accused me of not caring about her feelings because I was preoccupied with my appointment. She said she felt unimportant and wanted me to stop and focus on her when apologizing. I explained that I apologized without setting it up but after I was too busy but promised to do something for her when I could, mind you I was working, setting up the appointment, and feeling like dog water.

Later, once she was calm, I apologized for triggering her, explaining that I didn‚Äôt mean be aggressive with the remote or upset her‚Äîjust trying to joke around. She said it was okay and we went to sleep.

This morning, while setting up for a virtual doctors appointment, she turned and asked if we weren‚Äôt going to talk about last night. I stopped what I was doing and I reiterated my apology, saying it was unintentional and that I loved her. She stayed quiet and I kept setting up my appointment. She then asked why I thought it would be funny to slam the remote. I said I did it to lighten the mood, something I used to do with my family.

She then accused me of not caring about her feelings because I was preoccupied with my appointment. She said she felt unimportant and wanted me to stop and focus on her when apologizing. I explained that I apologized without setting it up but after I was too busy but promised to do something for her when I could, mind you I was working, setting up the appointment, and feeling like dog water.

She got more upset, criticizing me for not showing I was sorry and for my apology being ""bullshit and lies."" She told me next time to have my brain turned on when I was trying to apologize and to not be an asshole. I told her I wouldn‚Äôt apologize further if she kept being mean, and she called me an asshole again. She then tried to leave without telling me where she was going. After some back-and-forth, because she's left without telling me where before only to come back and saying she was at a bar and a bunch of guys kept hitting on her so I told her I'd leave next time she just left out of anger without saying where, she said she was going to her car to cool off.

Am I really the asshole here? I‚Äôve been in this relationship for seven years, and I want to fix things if I‚Äôm in the wrong. I just want some respect when being talked to.",1.0,0.006697085686028004,0,0
85,1e1lv2p,AITA For Bringing Up My Mother‚Äôs Body?,"Hi! I 14F was given permission to pick out some tops from the TikTok Shop and Temu by my 46F mother. I picked some trendy clothing that I usually see everyone wear that I'd like to have too. Everything was school appropriate. No crop tops, no tube tops or anything. But earlier today, she told me that everything was ugly and that she hated it. And most of it was too tight and would show my fat.

 I'm not the skinniest but I do have a slight pudge. But she keeps telling I eat too much sweets and too much bread and I never work out which is a lie, considering that I have volleyball today and I have tri weekly practices for school and this week had two days of practice after school practices are done. 

I told her before to stop shaming me and she called me weak and that no boy would want me for having such a fat belly. I called her a hypocrite because she has a massive layer of fat on herself too and she doesn't  exercise once so ever. She said her excuse was the fact that she had me and that I can't use that against her. And that I was a, lack of better words, an asshole for bring that up and to stop going against her words.

She told me to go to Fashion Nova and most of it is just everything that she wear or everything that people from my school and area want to wear. That's not who I am. I'm not that type of person. And it feels like she's trying to fit into a box that's not for me. 

The clothes aren't ugly there just not for me. And it just really giving how everyone in my city dresses or how her favorite bloggers dress or their kids. And I hate that style sorry.

So I just went to my room and I'm now typing this out. I'm really hurt and it feels unfair because theirs many girls out their with my body type wearing tube and crop tops. Nothing I'd wear to school but it still hurt that she'd insult the way I want to express myself.

AITAH?

Update 1: I tried to talk to my mother about it again, telling her I found nothing that I like or was child appropriate for me. She snatched my phone and scrolled for a minute straight before saying that she liked a pair of jeans for me. They were okay. I told her that I didn't like them. 

And again she brought up about how my stomach fat would leak out and how ugly it would look on my body and just told me to keep looking on site.

 I didn't go back on the site and I'm just sitting here crying, and I'm too scared to leave my room now. 

update 2: she brought me over and was showing me clothes on Fashion Nova. She told me these shirts (Graphic tees) would cover up my ""fupa"". I tried so hard not to cry and choke up.

 She got upset she I said I didn't like them. And told me no crop tops. Which I didn't even pick out crop tops.

 She then told me to show her the clothes I originally picked out and she'll decide if they're good enough for my body. I hate this so much.

 As I left her room she told me that it better not make me look fat. And that she's frustrated with me now. I'll update this when I get an answer.

update 3: It's been day since then and before I start to update I want to thank you all for the overriding support I have received!

It really made my day and made me feel so happy and genuinely made me smile.

To the update, I had save a bunch of reference photos for her to see and most of them she said maybe too, and she said she's worried about (again) my body fat hanging out. I told her to stop that, and that there not crop tops and nor are they tank tops so stop. 

She got upset at me, saying that she was only trying to help and that I was a big girl. Which I don't believe is true. I'm not big in that type of sense. I have muscles bigger than my school's own football team.

She also said the clothes I picked out looked too small. I told her I did pick the size yet and only favorited them. She said that not the point of the matter.

She told me they look like peasant clothes that white trailer trash would wear, which I found extremely weird to say. (We are black btw)

She said we'll spend some time tomorrow 
(Today) to look at clothes and other stuff. So far, not looking forward towards it. It's just constant shaming.

And sadly I have no where or no one to turn to in my life right now, considering it's just me and her, my father not in the picture. And my maternal side are all just going to say the same thing.

Also we relocate to a different country every couple of years (we moved in 4 different countries in 4 years so far), so it would be a painful and delicate item to keep relocating.

92,1e1l0xb,AITA for refusing to help my grandma get a Mustang?,"I (33F) am pretty close with my immediate family, specifically my grandmother (78). my grandmother has been my rock during some truly trying times, often pulling me out of the depths with emotional or financial help. I know I can go to her for anything. She has always been an extremely strong willed, opinionated and independent woman. She had a horse breeding business and loved to trail ride for as long as I can remember. About 4 years ago, she sold her ranch and almost all of her horses to purchase a smaller and more manageable condo. I could clearly see the change in her pace and demeanor, my lady was almost 80 after all. 

My grandmother is still fully independent and drives everyday. I must admit that I absolutely hate riding with her because she impedes on other lanes, cuts people off and is just the total trope of old lady driver. Last summer, she put regular gas in her diesel car and it was totaled out. She showed up the next day in a red Mustang soft top convertible. The family was up in arms but no one had much say so as it‚Äôs her money. I bit my tongue but also stopped letting her pick up the kids from school or take them to play dates. Less than two weeks after the Mustang showed up, my grandmother rear ended someone. The Mustang was totaled out but thankfully no one was injured. My ex husband is a car guy and was able to help her get into an SUV, a lightly used 2022 bronco sport. She‚Äôs had the Bronco for about 6 months and complained all along the way, blaming and calling my ex husband at work for every minor in convenience involving the bronco.

AITA here?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-12,"AITA for refusing to help my grandma get a Mustang? I (33F) am pretty close with my immediate family, specifically my grandmother (78). my grandmother has been my rock during some truly trying times, often pulling me out of the depths with emotional or financial help. I know I can go to her for anything. She has always been an extremely strong willed, opinionated and independent woman. She had a horse breeding business and loved to trail ride for as long as I can remember. About 4 years ago, she sold her ranch and almost all of her horses to purchase a smaller and more manageable condo. I could clearly see the change in her pace and demeanor, my lady was almost 80 after all. 

My grandmother is still fully independent and drives everyday. I must admit that I absolutely hate riding with her because she impedes on other lanes, cuts people off and is just the total trope of old lady driver. Last summer, she put regular gas in her diesel car and it was totaled out. She showed up the next day in a red Mustang soft top convertible. The family was up in arms but no one had much say so as it‚Äôs her money. I bit my tongue but also stopped letting her pick up the kids from school or take them to play dates. Less than two weeks after the Mustang showed up, my grandmother rear ended someone. The Mustang was totaled out but thankfully no one was injured. My ex husband is a car guy and was able to help her get into an SUV, a lightly used 2022 bronco sport. She‚Äôs had the Bronco for about 6 months and complained all along the way, blaming and calling my ex husband at work for every minor in convenience involving the bronco.

93,1e1kqns,AITA for not telling my girlfriend I don't like her best friend?,"
I (17yo) have a girlfriend Evelyn (16yo) who has a best friend Charlotte (16yo), to be consize this ""best friend"" it's a person that constantly search for attention and shows discomfort when she doesn't receive it, for instance every time the three of us hangout and I do simply things like holding my girlfriend's hand Charlotte express how she's ""third wheeling"" with us, to be clear, Evelyn and Charlotte were friends before I met Evelyn and they usually walk holding hands. Charlotte tends to deviate my girlfriend's attention towards her when Evelyn is talking to me, numerous times I've to tell Charlotte to give us a moment to talk to my girlfriend without getting interrupted.

Charlotte also has makes vulgar comments about my girlfriend and I, and shows a clear disgust towards me (e.g. when Charlotte sees me she makes vomit noises, she also make noises when I hug Evelyn or Evelyn and I are simply sitted next to each other). Charlotte has also make comments (""jokes"") about my girlfriend's body in public which makes my girlfriend feel uncomfortable, also if someone would do similar ""jokes"" about Charlotte she would response saying the those jokes are offensive because she's ""consious about her body"".

Charlotte also tends to talk about my girlfriend's private stuff, such as Evlyn beeing bisexual for a time or talking with Evelyn's mom about Evelyn's bad grade before Evelyn can talk to her mom, which has caused Evelyn to be grounded and damage the trust between Evelyn and her mom.

Recently I have talked to Evelyn about this situations, and how Charlotte tends to search for Evelyn's attention when we're together but also I told here I'm okay with it. I said this because Charlotte is the only female friend that Evelyn's has and I also don't want to intenfere on a friendship that existed before I entere Evelyn's life

(Edit) To clarify Evelyn said that she isn't okay with all this stuff that her friend does, but she doesn't do anything about it, I have recommended her to talk to her about it, and she said she will but it doesn't seem to be happening any time soon

94,1e1klm2,AITA for accidentally outing my co-worker?,"During covid, I worked at a fast food restaurant (18f). You can probably imagine the work being pretty stressful, but it brought me closer to my co-workers. Most of them were around my age and about to graduate high school, like me. I had a co-worker who cross trained me (Idk how old he was, at least a couple years older than me). He was always friendly and patient with me. Though when we had moments alone together he asked if I had a boyfriend. I laughed it off and said I wasn‚Äôt interested in dating because I had a lot going on, and I planned on moving out of state after graduating, anyway. At the time he accepted that answer. 

Not long before Christmas, one of my other co-workers accidentally spilled the beans that he had a HUGE crush on me. I was surprised, (I had a hunch but it had been weeks since he alluded to it) but literally everyone else in the restaurant were completely shocked that I had no idea how serious he was about it. As it turns out, he had told EVERYONE including all our managers how much he liked me and wanted to take me out. I was pretty uncomfortable by this. At the end of our last shift before the holidays he confessed that he liked me. Like REALLY liked me. I was already aware at this point and still a bit uncomfortable, so I just said it was sweet and went home. When we came back from break I was starting to avoid him, yet he cornered me by our lockers and gave me a handmaid necklace for all our co-workers to see. (I eventually gave it back). 

He had told me (unsolicited) about his sexuality before. I casually mentioned this to another co-worker while we were prepping and she said she hadn‚Äôt known about his sexuality. She then was adamant about making me understand that I had outed him to everyone around us. Having grown up in the south, I honestly hadn‚Äôt known that was even a thing that could happen. Not to mention he was pretty close with everyone and knew them longer than I have, so I assumed they all knew. I even led with that at first. I also found it confusing, since he‚Äôd told everyone else about his feelings for me but not me directly. I was super apologetic about it, as she was very offended by my ignorance, and fortunately he wasn‚Äôt there to witness it. After that interaction, my other co-worker, who was open about his sexuality, assured me that it was okay, that he understood I really hadn‚Äôt meant any harm by outing him. 

It‚Äôs been eating at me for a while, because despite how uncomfortable that co-worker made me feel, I still feel like my ignorance was undeserving. AITA? 

TL;DR: a co-worker had an inappropriate crush on me and I accidentally revealed his sexuality to other people because I assumed they already knew.

EDIT for clarification: as I said this happened during covid in 2020-2021, so it‚Äôs been three and a half years since all of this occurred. I made this post because I was reflecting about my dilemma. It‚Äôs impossible for me to contact anyone in this situation as I‚Äôve moved out of state and gone to college. Even if I wanted to, I have no point of contact with any of those co-workers. That being said, the co-worker who had a crush on me parted on decent terms, I don‚Äôt think he ever learned about me accidentally outing him because it was never mentioned and he had no animosity toward me in my time there. Obviously that doesn‚Äôt excuse what I did, but that‚Äôs the impression I got. (Hence my post) Regarding his advances, we talked it out and that‚Äôs when I gave him his necklace back and told him to give it to someone that would appreciate it more. From there it stopped, though I still wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable around him. 

Also, please consider that there is a whole lot more to sexuality than liking the opposite sex OR the same sex. Maybe I hadn‚Äôt explained it well enough, but he was outed in a society where the assumption is that most people are strictly heterosexual. And unlike the other co-workers I was talking to, he wasn‚Äôt open about being part of queer communities. They were some of the first open people I really talked to on a near-daily basis, so yes my ignorance was prevalent as most LGBTQIA+ people hardly ever engaged with people outside their communities where I lived (at least at the time). On top of that I didn‚Äôt consume any content or resources featuring queer people at all at that point. In the time since, I‚Äôve been trying to be more aware about some of the social nuances that exist, though I may still be ignorant about a lot of things. 

Anyways, thanks everyone for your input, and again sorry or any confusion that my post caused!

A coworker (late 20s F) and I were eating lunch together, and we got to talking about the experiences and struggles of being women in tech. I'm more of a tomboy and she's more flamboyant - bright colors, heavy makeup, jewelry, purses, etc. and also has a fuller figure. We are on the same team but don't usually work closely together, since she's more front facing towards customers and sales and I'm a backend coder who maintains parts of our infrastructure. So I thought we were having a surprisingly good conversation, and I was enjoying it, but I made a comment about how one thing I've noticed about being a woman in a tech company is that it's harder when you aren't conventionally attractive, and I pointed to myself. Then, because I thought we were getting along, I got vulnerable and gestured to her and said that she's more conventionally attractive than me. She immediately made a sour face and shut down the conversation. I tried a few times to ask what she was mad about, but she said she didn't want to talk about it and wound up leaving even though we still had plenty of time for the rest of our lunch break. I found out from another coworker that she has been spending lunches eating alone at her desk, and that she's been acting mopey and withdrawn.

96,1e1kjtb,AITA for admitting I prefer one of our foster children over the other two? ,"I (f29) have been with my girlfriend (f33) Lea, for 4 ¬Ω years. Things moved quickly and we have been living together since 4 years.

In the beginning, we openly spoke about wanting kids. She said, she was fine either way, and while I admit, I have some desire to be a parent, I decided against having children, even before I met Lea, because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm suited to be a parent. I have ADHD and some of the typical comorbidities, like depression. As a result, my energy is often low, as is my patience and stress tolerance.

  
But, I have had a ‚Äúpart-time-foster-kid‚Äù, Fynn, (m13) for 11 years. When I was 18, I worked at a group home for disabled children, where I got assigned to mainly care for Fynn. To say, we got attached to each other, is an understatement and yes, it was by no means a professional relationship.

Fast forward, while I don‚Äôt have custody of Fynn, I got the right to visit/access him after I stopped working at his group home. He is with me around two weekends a month, we go on holidays together at least twice a year and plan on becoming his legal guardian once he turns 18. He is a very sweet teen, and while he is non-verbal, he communicates through vocalizations and body language.

When Lea and I started dating, she was supportive. Taking care of Fynn is completely my responsibility and I neither expect, or want Lea to take over his medical care or watching him by herself. But she helps out here and there and even got her driving license, so we were a lot more mobile with the wheelchair.

My girlfriend had an older sister, who was a single mother to two daughters (f5 and f8), Anna and Delia. Around June 2023, the girls mom got diagnosed with cancer and sadly has passed away around Christmas. When Leas sister started chemo, Anna and Dora were ¬†staying either with us or their grandparents. I don‚Äôt want to go into detail, but it was a hard time for their family. Despite the cancer, the passing of Leas sister was still unexpected.

For the first month, Anna and Delia stayed with their grandparents, but due to Leas parents age, Anna and Delia started staying with us fulltime.  
As of right now, I would say, I am a parental role for them and the worries, I had about parenthood have been confirmed. I am overwhelmed a lot, feel my patience running thin and often have to stop myself from being unfairly mad at Anna and Delia.

  
Yesterday, I opened up to Lea about my struggles and she suggested, that Fynn should stop visiting us or at least less. I got angry at her, because I‚Äôve been a part of Fynns life for years now, and like, how is this fair to him? Lea accused me of preferring Fynn over than Anna and Delia.

Honestly, yes, I have a closer bond with him. Spending time with him is less draining for me, so I confirmed Leas statement.

Well, now Lea is quite mad at me. I should have worded it differently, yet at the moment, I thought being honest was the right choice. But now I worry, it was cruel to admit it to Lea‚Ä¶ So, am I the asshole? ¬†

97,1e1k2ej,WIBTA for refusing to sing for my father's funeral ,"My (25F) father (52M) told me yesterday that he wants my sister and I to sing for his funeral. 

My sister and I used to go to singing lessons and perform at concerts when we were in school. We used to sing with our mother all of the time. But quite frankly, since his stage 4 cancer diagnosis two years ago, I haven't been singing much at all.  I came home from work late at night, told my parents about my day then Dad tells me that there's a song that he wants my sister and I to learn for his funeral. Then asks if I know any recording studios around (I have musician friends) Mum forwarded the song to me via text and prefaced it with ""get tissues ready""

The song in question is ""Dance with my Father"" by Luthor Vandross. It's a lovely song but I can't stomach the thought of singing it for my father's funeral. I am already barely coping with how sick he's been lately and this is sending me over the edge. I told Mum that I listened to the song and that I don't think I can sing it. I even commented that I've never seen him listen to Luthor Vandross in my life (he's more a Dad rock kinda guy) but she just shrugged and said ""well he listened to the song and really connected with it"".

Recording it instead of singing it live seems fine on paper. But I don't want to put myself in that position of having to sing about my dead dad. Knowing myself, it'd be an emotionally draining experience to go through. I cry just thinking about it. I cried listening to that song for the first time ever. Wrecked my mental health for the whole day.

I have no idea if my sister knows about this request. I've only spoken to my partner about how I feel about this. I don't want to do it. I'm already in a vulnerable and sensitive place with his chemotherapy not working, how sick he's gotten in the last few months and now he's talking about funerals. How can he so casually ask this of us? I don't want my father to die, let alone sing about it. I'm scared to tell him that I don't want to do it, just sort of hoping Mum tells him what I told her.

For the sake of the post I'm going to call my gf's other partner Bea. Bea is EXTREMELY pushy. For example if she thinks you're not being truthful she will push until she gets the truth. Then she will get upset if she doesn't like the truth. 

The main issue started in June. My girlfriend has a DND campaign that both Bea and I played in. I didn't particularly like it, and left the planning group chat.

99,1e1jm6l,AITA for walking home alone at night?,"I (23F) was at a birthday party yesterday and I went home around 10:30-ish pm. The party was a few towns over from where I live so I took the train back to my hometown. The problem was that yesterday was Thursday, and on weekdays the buses in my town only run until like 9:30 pm. So I decided to walk the 20 minutes home from the train station. On the way home I sent a pic of a dark alley I walked through to my friends on Snapchat jokingly saying something like: ‚ÄûAm I being delusional for thinking that it's super peaceful to walk home alone at night? üòÇ‚Äú not really thinking much more of it.

¬†

When I arrived at home I didn‚Äòt feel tired yet so I watched some Netflix. About half an hour later I received a call from one of my best friends (23F), one of the people I sent the pic on Snap to, asking me if I was okay. I just said ‚Äûyeah?‚Äú and she said that she was really worried about me and couldn‚Äòt sleep (she had to wake up the next day at 4 am, so that wasn‚Äòt good) without knowing I was safe. I assured her I was fine and apologized for not reacting to her previous text that she had sent 20 mins earlier. I had only just seen it when she called me.

¬†

The today I get a message on Snapchat from one of my other friends (25M), who also received the pic of the alley yesterday. He was kinda chastising me for doing it, and also saying I was asking for something to happen to me. Which is peak victim blaming bullcrap if you ask me. He also berated me for worrying my other friend (he and her are in a situationship) saying that the people close to me were more concerned about my safety than I was. He also said that my 23F friend was pissed that I didn‚Äòt call her to drive me home (he is a questionable source of info though, she was probably more worried than angry).

¬†

I just answered I wasn‚Äòt limiting myself to do stuff just because I am a woman. I‚Äòm 5‚Äú4‚Äò and 100 lbs with no self-defense skills, so I probably wouldn‚Äòt really stand a chance if I was attacked. I said wasn‚Äòt going through life with fear just because something might happen. I also said that statistics were on my side, especially for where I live. I was much more likely to be hurt by someone I know than some rando on the street. I just added that he was asking for catching these hands with his asking-for-it-attitude (that was a bad joke I tried to diffuse the situation with) and ended the conversation there.

¬†

So, I admit it was probably a bad idea to send that Snap. I do have a dark kind of gallows humor and lacking social awareness. I shouldn‚Äòt have worried my friends. Maybe I should have also shared my live location with someone. BUT I have also walked home many times before without any issues. Where I live is very safe and barely anybody is out at night. My friends all know I like to walk home at night alone from time to time, so I don‚Äòt think it shocked anyone, though they have expressed disapproval in the past.

I got a cold after the first day of staying with them and had been trying to treat it and get better while also staying away from people as to not get them sick, but my family wants me to keep going places with them, which obviously has a high chance of getting everyone else sick, as well as we all be in one car while I‚Äôm coughing. (Don‚Äôt even mention wearing a mask, they‚Äôll yell at me if I bring one into public). I have a persistent sore throat, coughing and also had a horrendous migraine the first day I caught it. The whole time I‚Äôve been trying to treat myself my grandmother has been telling me I‚Äôm not sick I just have a sore throat. Yesterday I had a fever of 99.9¬∞F, to which she said was not a fever and that I wasn‚Äôt sick while I was coughing like crazy. 

Last night I was feeling a lot better and my temperature went down to 95.5¬∞F, but this morning I wake up and just feel terrible again and am coughing more. I obviously want to be left alone but my Grandmother starts to come over to get in my face and poke and tease me like she always does, and she knows I hate when she does this because after the first time of her doing it I always try to get away from her when she does it and then she complains ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you like to be touched?‚Äù

This morning I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with it and started say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù right when she started coming towards me. She kept coming and I said ‚ÄúNO‚Äù louder and louder four times until she started to reach for me and get in my face and I finally pushed her hand away and yelled ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù Then she looks at me with the most offended face and tells me ‚ÄúYou do not talk to me that way, this is my house!‚Äù

Obviously she starts yelling at me that I‚Äôm not sick, then decides to go off on my mother about the way she‚Äôs raised me. I‚Äôm full grown fucking adult.

My Grandmother is waiting for me to apologize to her, thinking she didn‚Äôt do anything to warrant my reaction when I straight up explained what the reason was and my mother wants me to apologize to cause we‚Äôre basically ‚Äúdisowned‚Äù as of right now. 

This has nothing to do with my pride with apologizing, I want them to get it through their head why I yelled.

My friend and I booked a trip last year to go to London together. The trip is supposed to be this year in late august.

However my life took an unexpected turn this year when my bf moved back to his home country (Switzerland) after getting a better job opportunity. He had moved back out a few months ago & he wanted me to go with as soon as possible. We decided that I would go out towards the beginning of july to give me time.

Now of course my move devastated my friend but she also got upset with me for not moving out after our trip because she said it was all so rushed. I didn‚Äôt argue with her because I understood why she was upset however, my bf and I didn‚Äôt wanna be away from each other for even longer.

I don't feel though this is a 50/50 deal, more like 80/20 deal with him benefiting more than me. I would pay a maximum of $150 a week rent plus bills and groceries. That is around the amount I am willing to pay, not $300 a week rent plus bills and groceries. ¬†

107,1e1iiq4,AITA for Causing a Neighborhood Feud Over a Gnome?,"Hi everyone,

I live in a usually peaceful suburban neighborhood where everyone gets along‚Äîuntil recently. It all started when my neighbor ‚ÄúTom‚Äù placed a flamboyant, suggestive rainbow-colored lawn gnome in his front yard. This gnome isn‚Äôt just any gnome; it‚Äôs about 2 feet tall, posing provocatively, and adorned with a rainbow hat covering its private parts. It‚Äôs been the talk of the neighborhood and quite frankly, an eyesore.

Most of us have kept our opinions to ourselves, but the gnome is directly across from my living room window, and it‚Äôs been driving me nuts. In a moment of frustration, I decided to take action. One night, I sneaked over and moved the gnome to Tom‚Äôs backyard, thinking it would be out of sight and out of mind.

The next morning, Tom was furious. He knocked on my door and demanded to know if I had anything to do with his ‚Äúmissing gnome.‚Äù I tried to play it cool, but eventually, I admitted what I did. Tom was livid and accused me of trespassing and vandalizing his property. He also revealed that the gnome was a symbol of pride and acceptance for his recently out son, and it had deep sentimental value.

Now, Tom has rallied a few other neighbors against me, saying I disrespected his property and crossed a line. Some neighbors are accusing me of being homophobic, which was never my intention.

I left him and moved back home expecting support from my parents. Instead, they were upset with me for leaving without notice and not trying to make things work.

After all this, I chose to go very low-contact. They each get one, 35 minute phone call once a month. They have rules for what they can and cannot discuss.

She‚Äôs always bossed me around my whole life with what I should eat on a daily and what I should wear. She belittles everything I do and any time I ask her for help she yells at me and tells me how stupid can I possibly be. As if I should immediately know how taxes work for example. Another big one is cooking. Anytime I‚Äôd try using the stove and I ask her one question she ends up pushing me out of the way and finishing the rest, not even bothering to show me, calling me incompetent. 

At some point we ended up adopting two dogs in addition to the dog we‚Äôve had since a puppy (Coconut). I started my first job at 14 as a busser at a restaurant. I worked a lot but my mother would instantly take my checks to help pay the bills. I still took care of all three dogs and taught them loads of commands, would brush them daily, trim their nails, even brush their teeth, and I watched a bunch of videos of how to give good massages to dogs so that it keeps their muscles and joints loose and healthy. At least twice a week I did each of their specialized activities with them. One dog I did agility, the other I did scent work and the third I went on mile runs with them. 
About seven months ago, we moved and my mother and little sister moved in with her new boyfriend (Brandon) and I live in the garage apartment thing just a few steps away from the house with the two dogs we adopted and my boyfriend (Jack). 

In the beginning I was living off of my financial aid money with Jacks help because I‚Äôm a full time college student but now that it‚Äôs summer I‚Äôm working full time with three jobs.

My mother lost it on me one day and said I don‚Äôt take care of the dogs, I‚Äôm constantly neglecting them, I‚Äôm not responsible, ect.

She said she didn't know why and it wasn't a big deal. I said I didn't know either and asked if she could try to be like that so often when i wss with. She said something like ‚ÄúI have a right to voice my anger. I've taken enough shit from everyone for so long that I get to do this now.‚Äù I tried to explain that I understand that she was upset and she does have a right to voice her anger, but It really stresses me out to the point of panic attack. I don't know why since I'd like to think I've had a pretty damn easy life so far. (knock on wood.) My mom got upset at me and of course I start crying since I'm really emotional and then she starts crying. So we're both sitting in the car at home in the driveway, crying, sadly eating McDonald's, while there's some country song playing on the radio. Quite the scene lol. I've always had a hard time explaining myself so I tried to use an analogy that I don't even remember what it is. She thought it didn't matter and finally I just said to forget about it but she was still super upset. I didn't think I was in the wrong at first, but now I think I am.

Edit: y'all, my momma is super duper sweet. I know it doesn't come off this way but this is only one example of her. She's really kind to others, and always leaves at least a 20% tip for out waiter when we go out. (I know it's customary but people such so it's actually kinda rare here.) She used to work is service so she understands what it's like to be a waitress, and she only stopped just recently because of health problems.

116,1e1frwg,AITA for not massaging my dads back any more?,"Hey Reddit,

I'm a 17-year-old girl with parents who are significantly older than most of my friends' parents. My mom is 50, and my dad is 56. Over the past few years, their health has been declining, primarily due to being overweight. My dad, in particular, struggles a lot. He can't even sit down without letting out a big scream because of the pain in his back.

For the last five years, I've had to step up and take care of them in ways that no teenager should have to. I've memorized their schedules, cooked dinner every night they'd let me, put them to bed, chores, and even given them exhausting massages to help with their discomfort.

Honestly, I'm exhausted. I feel like I have to take care of them when they barely take care of me. They don't talk to me much, and when they do, it feels like they're not really listening. Everything I say I need is taken into minor consideration, if at all. I don't even remember the last time my parents cooked a meal for me. 

This problem has caused me to start arguments and I explode on my parents in frustration where I say that I‚Äôm tired of taking care of them and the conversation usually goes one of three ways:

1) ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a kid. You don‚Äôt know what tired feels like.‚Äù

2) ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I‚Äôm not your grandma, if I ever spoke that way she would‚Äôve‚Ä¶‚Äù

3) ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how lucky you are. I wish I could do this stuff on my own.‚Äù

So‚Ä¶Let me reel this back in. Massaging is my dads favorite part of all the things I do for him whether that‚Äôs forehead, head, feet, back, shoulders, neck, etc. The point is I‚Äôm basically a masseuse. We‚Äôve improvised multiple ways to make the process easier for both of us like using massage guns but to be honest I feel almost traumatized by the way he reacts to the massage gun, yelling in pain as I‚Äôm targeting the tough spots. (He says this is an excuse just because I don‚Äôt want to do it which is partly true‚Ä¶)

I feel a sense of anxiety knowing that my fathers relaxation and comfort relies on how well I do or how hard I push‚Ä¶Plus the massage gun hurts my hands due to the extreme vibrations causing hand irritation. It‚Äôs just gotten to the point where I‚Äôm not comfortable doing it anymore and he‚Äôs trying to manipulate me into continuing this tedious process on his body. 

‚ÄúSo you don‚Äôt want me to feel better?‚Äù He tells me. Maybe this just riles me up because I spend so much time dedicated to helping him and he has the ability to question if I want him to feel satisfied. That‚Äôs what I spend my time doing, bro.

117,1e1fjq0,AITA for calling bullshit on my sister‚Äôs interpretation of our mother‚Äôs will?,"My mom died in March, and we live in Minnesota. She had three adult children, and her last update to her will (2011) specifically states an equal split between the three of us. It also names her friend and my sister as co-representatives for her estate.

In 2021, the Colorado Dept of Revenue seized $500 from one of her checking accounts because (unbeknownst to me) she had made me a co-owner of the account. (She had also done this for my siblings.) Colorado says I owe them some money, I disagree, and don‚Äôt have the money to pay them anyway. My brother has a similar situation with the IRS.

Our mom feared that the tax man would seize her other accounts if they were associated with either of us, so she took us off the TOD (Transfer on Death), which had previously named all three of us, and just left my sister as sole TOD beneficiary. She told both me and my brother that we were not disinherited. We were not being cut out. But our sister had her shit together, tax-wise, and if anything should happen to her, our sister would ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù and still ‚Äúdivide the assets evenly.‚Äù

My brother and I were both told the same thing (equal split, not disinherited). My sister says she was surprised to learn that she was the sole beneficiary, but that must have been what mom intended because she set it up that way and never said anything to the contrary. She also left no explanation for this departure from the equal split paradigm she had always espoused.

My sister found out about the annuities shortly after our mother‚Äôs death. I don‚Äôt know how many, but at least two. I don‚Äôt know how much, but at least $360k, possibly twice that. They are set to pay enough to live on comfortably but not extravagantly for the next 18 years. My sister has stated that the annuities will not be divided, and she still intends to take a third of the remainder of whatever is left after selling the house, car, and a few small items of value.

Eventually, with the help of my therapist, I‚Äôm in a place where I can be in the same room as her. We talked about estate business last night, no major disagreements then she said, ‚Äúour brother hasn‚Äôt made eye contact with me for weeks.‚Äù

So here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole. I said, ‚ÄúHe is probably still in shock or still processing the enormous betrayal by you to your siblings and also to the trust mom placed to be fair and to do the right thing. Instead, you chose to screw us out of the lion‚Äôs share of the estate, then take a third of whatever is leftover..

What did you expect? That nothing would change? That your brothers would still treat you the same way? That we would still travel every summer so our kids could see each other? That your brothers would still consider you to be family after you stole our inheritance?‚Äù

She looked surprised. I went on a run to the liquor store a few minutes later. When I returned, I could see her on the front step on a call to one of her girlfriends, crying.

So Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my sister that she has chosen money over family?


Edit - holy shit this blew up. I will read every comment and reply to as many as I can. 

Before adding a comment please consider the following:

1) I have my own estate attorney already.
2) My sister has NOT broken the law.
3) TOD distributions happen before probate.
4) TOD assets are not considered in the probate stage. There is no legal challenge to make, nothing to fight. If you don‚Äôt understand (no judgement there, it‚Äôs not intuitive) maybe this example will help?

Example: If my mom had $5 to her name, no debt, and lived in a cardboard box when she died, $3 in cash and $2 in an account listing my sister as TOD beneficiary, and her will said ‚Äúdivide my estate evenly between my three children‚Äù It would probably play out like this.

The $2  becomes my sisters the moment the bank received the death certificate. The $3 in cash plus the proceeds from selling her  beggars cup,,  cardboard box, and shoes at the estate sale let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs worth another $5 added to the $3 less any debts that are submitted by creditors ($2 vet bill) are what gets divided up and distributed to the three heirs after taxes. 

So the estate starts with $5, $2 goes to sister leaving $3, sister sells shoes and cup adding $5 to the $3 so now we have $8, sister pays moms bills, so down to $6,  sister files tax return (nothing owed), waits a year to distribute $6 to the three kids including herself. $2 each. If she shared her ‚Äúextra $2‚Äù it would be subject to gift tax.

I hope that‚Äôs clear.

To everyone assuming tax fraud or tax cheat or whatever else. Not everyone who owes money to the government is a criminal or bad person. Some of us are just stupid, and sometimes the IRS  makes mistakes.

Edit: The community has judged. Thank you for your deliberations. I have read every single comment. How do we move forward as a family? Should my brother and I go no contact with my sister as some of you advocate?

This is what I have set in motion. I have offered to pay for one therapy session each for my brother and my sister. if they are so inclined, and my therapist agrees, we will have family counseling to see if we can reach a place where we are all at peace.

Surprisingly, both have accepted my offer. my therapist is well-known to my family. He is amazing and very professional. I have been seeing him for almost 9 years.

The current situation is the result of my failing to understand how and who to pay taxes to over 10 years ago. I did not cheat or commit fraud, I just filed the wrong form or checked the wrong box and ended up owing Colorado almost $10,000 after penalties and interests in a year where I made less than $50,000 and payed taxes to the federal government and Minnesota out of that. 

The income earned  and taxes owed all happened in 2013. Colorado took money out of my mom‚Äôs account in 2021 because I ignored them and didn‚Äôt know that Colorado could or would go after my mom‚Äôs checking account in Minnesota until after the fact. 

My mom had a fear based reaction and made changes that perhaps were not well thought out. She used to be pretty sharp, but her mental acuity was in decline as her chronic kidney disease progressed. I‚Äôm glad she cannot see this current situation and her hand in creating it. I am certain that the position we three find ourselves in now is not what she intended.

I have learned a lot in the last 24 hours from many of your comments and from research based on that. Here is my proposal to ‚Äúmake things right‚Äù and I think my mom would approve.

My sister should keep the annuity. The payments provide her stability and I know my mom would want that. Especially with her asshole ex-husband, taking glee in his adversarial role exploiting every mistake she makes or weakness she shows.

If my sister attempted to share the annuity, she would complicate taxes for everyone. No one wants this.

However. She should be open and forthright about the full value of what she has received TOD to her two brothers. This amount should be subtracted from her share of what remains in the estate. In the end, we would all end up with a third of the estate. This is what my mom wanted, this was her intent.

Trusts should be created. The estate should be divided into these trusts. The Will specifically mentions this over and over again. 

My mother would‚Äôve preferred that all of her children had the benefit of the stability that the annuity provides my sister. It is too late for that now. But it is not too late for my sister to use her power to correct for the mistakes that were made near the end. 

She has all the power here, and she can make this right, without harming her own interests, unless she really does want more than her fair share. Her fair share is 1/3 to be clear. She is also due any expenses incurred as executor and for her time.

The $3 in cash plus the proceeds from selling her  beggars cup,,  cardboard box, and shoes at the estate sale let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs worth another $5 added to the $3 less any debts that are submitted by creditors ($2 vet bill) are what gets divided up and distributed to the three heirs after taxes. 

So the estate starts with $5, $2 goes to sister leaving $3, sister sells shoes and cup adding $5 to the $3 so now we have $8, sister pays moms bills, so down to $6,  sister files tax return (nothing owed), waits a year to distribute $6 to the three kids including herself. $2 each. If she shared her ‚Äúextra $2‚Äù it would be subject to gift tax.

I hope that‚Äôs clear.

To everyone assuming tax fraud or tax cheat or whatever else. Not everyone who owes money to the government is a criminal or bad person. Some of us are just stupid, and sometimes the IRS  makes mistakes.

Edit: The community has judged. Thank you for your deliberations. I have read every single comment. How do we move forward as a family? Should my brother and I go no contact with my sister as some of you advocate?

This is what I have set in motion. I have offered to pay for one therapy session each for my brother and my sister. if they are so inclined, and my therapist agrees, we will have family counseling to see if we can reach a place where we are all at peace.

Surprisingly, both have accepted my offer. my therapist is well-known to my family. He is amazing and very professional. I have been seeing him for almost 9 years.

The current situation is the result of my failing to understand how and who to pay taxes to over 10 years ago. I did not cheat or commit fraud, I just filed the wrong form or checked the wrong box and ended up owing Colorado almost $10,000 after penalties and interests in a year where I made less than $50,000 and payed taxes to the federal government and Minnesota out of that. 

The income earned  and taxes owed all happened in 2013. Colorado took money out of my mom‚Äôs account in 2021 because I ignored them and didn‚Äôt know that Colorado could or would go after my mom‚Äôs checking account in Minnesota until after the fact. 

My mom had a fear based reaction and made changes that perhaps were not well thought out. She used to be pretty sharp, but her mental acuity was in decline as her chronic kidney disease progressed. I‚Äôm glad she cannot see this current situation and her hand in creating it. I am certain that the position we three find ourselves in now is not what she intended.

I have learned a lot in the last 24 hours from many of your comments and from research based on that. Here is my proposal to ‚Äúmake things right‚Äù and I think my mom would approve.

My sister should keep the annuity. The payments provide her stability and I know my mom would want that. Especially with her asshole ex-husband, taking glee in his adversarial role exploiting every mistake she makes or weakness she shows.

If my sister attempted to share the annuity, she would complicate taxes for everyone. No one wants this.

However. She should be open and forthright about the full value of what she has received TOD to her two brothers. This amount should be subtracted from her share of what remains in the estate. In the end, we would all end up with a third of the estate. This is what my mom wanted, this was her intent.

Trusts should be created. The estate should be divided into these trusts. The Will specifically mentions this over and over again. 

My mother would‚Äôve preferred that all of her children had the benefit of the stability that the annuity provides my sister. It is too late for that now. But it is not too late for my sister to use her power to correct for the mistakes that were made near the end. 

She has all the power here, and she can make this right, without harming her own interests, unless she really does want more than her fair share. Her fair share is 1/3 to be clear. She is also due any expenses incurred as executor and for her time.

Then her MOH texts me with the itinerary and it‚Äôs looking like the price will actually be around $500-800.

Anyway - my son‚Äôs father sees him for two nights every fortnight. He picks him up late Friday night and drops him off early Sunday morning every two weeks. Now when he first started being consistent, I would offer money to make sure my son was fed and safe. I only did this because for the last 5 years he would give excuses of ‚ÄúI have no money to feed him‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have no petrol‚Äù.

My (30F) mum (68F) doesn't like my dad's (67M) family. She gets along with them for my dad's sake and for appearances, but she can't stand most of them.

He'd rather brush everything under the rug than accept that his family can be wrong and confront them, but that's another story.

125,1e1cldc,AITA for telling my mom I don‚Äôt feel loved by her? ,"hi, im a 21F and im currently living with my parents, who both have enforced a 11pm curfew onto me. I drive on my own, and go out maybe about twice a week, other than that I attend all my normal obligations (job, school, etc) without trouble and they even have my location at all times (i don‚Äôt go to bars, clubs, any late night activities)

now on occasion i will be late about three, maybe even four minutes. Right at 11:03, i might enter the house. Keep in mind, i don‚Äôt have younger siblings that need sleep, it‚Äôs just my parents who don‚Äôt even sleep before midnight and my older brother (22, who has absolutely no curfew). 

When i come home even minutes late, my mom goes on a rampage and yells at me and is extremely upset that i didn‚Äôt make it on time. Even when i make it right on time she‚Äôll make some kind of remark like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre getting too close‚Äù or ‚Äúwatch yourself‚Äù 

Today i came home quite late, around 20 minutes over 11. I had even told her that I was going out to have a serious talk with my boyfriend (at a cafe that‚Äôs known to be safe and close by) and that i might be over the curfew. But as soon as i entered, she was visibly upset and raised her voice at me saying my curfew was going to be reduced to 10:30 now. 

i was obviously upset, but didn‚Äôt show it, as my mom is Korean and there‚Äôs somewhat of like this ‚Äúrespect‚Äù thing where ill never yell back or talk back to her. so i just nodded and listened to her as she kept yelling at me for being ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù , ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù and whatnot. So she tells me ‚Äú10:30, you need to be home.‚Äù To which I reply ‚ÄúI can make it by 11‚Äù. This is simply me standing up for myself, because simply i do think a 10:30 curfew at 21 is ridiculous. 

Then my mom goes to say that im being rebellious and that im ignoring what she was saying. To which I responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not rebelling against you, I‚Äôm simply communicating a boundary of a curfew time that I think is appropriate for me‚Äù. But then she yells back that im talking back, that I‚Äôm calling her a liar, and that it‚Äôs basically the same thing as being rebellious. 

I then ask her a question back- ‚Äúare you mad when i come home past my curfew because Im ‚Äúdisobeying‚Äú your rules or are you upset because you‚Äôre worried that im unsafe outside? She responds that it‚Äôs both. I then tell her that I feel like she only enforces my curfew and gets upset at me because she just enjoys having something to get on me about. And then i mention that when i come home late and the first thing she does is yell at me and accuses me of being a rebel or disobeying daughter, that I can‚Äôt tell that she‚Äôs ‚Äúcaring‚Äù for me or doing it out of worry. 

She then goes on to say that her talking to me in that moment (note: shes not just ‚Äútalking‚Äù, she‚Äôs straight yelling) is proof that she cares about me. And then I said that it doesn‚Äôt feel that way, and that it‚Äôs not a feeling of care being displayed in me, but rather fear. She starts talking sarcastically saying ‚Äúwhat are you? A little kid still? You want me to tell you in a sweeter voice? Or you want me to hug you while telling you? Write you a letter?‚Äù And continues to say that it‚Äôs not her fault i don‚Äôt feel loved or cared for. And that she‚Äôs doing her best to show it and if that‚Äôs not how i receive it then it‚Äôs just my fault.

So what i don‚Äôt get is that when i say something and she takes it in a certain way, if she interprets it in one way then that‚Äôs how i intended on saying it no matter what. But then when i question how something she does makes me feel a certain way, she says that it‚Äôs my fault for feeling that way and that it‚Äôs not true. AITA for not understanding and feeling her ‚Äúlove‚Äù? 

The conversation simply ended with her saying that she was feeling less worried for me at that point and just straight upset, so she told me to go away upstairs before she got actually upset (she already was so idk the point of that) 

Note: i don‚Äôt even go out late at night anywhere far, i don‚Äôt get into trouble, she knows everyone i hang out with/my location.  I have a step brother who‚Äôs no contact with her because he had enough of how she treated him, and my Grandma from my dad‚Äôs side is also no contact with her for various reasons. I‚Äôm literally about to add myself to that list if this keeps up lol. 
",TL;DR,2024-07-12,"AITA for telling my mom I don‚Äôt feel loved by her?  hi, im a 21F and im currently living with my parents, who both have enforced a 11pm curfew onto me. I drive on my own, and go out maybe about twice a week, other than that I attend all my normal obligations (job, school, etc) without trouble and they even have my location at all times (i don‚Äôt go to bars, clubs, any late night activities)

now on occasion i will be late about three, maybe even four minutes. Right at 11:03, i might enter the house. Keep in mind, i don‚Äôt have younger siblings that need sleep, it‚Äôs just my parents who don‚Äôt even sleep before midnight and my older brother (22, who has absolutely no curfew). 

When i come home even minutes late, my mom goes on a rampage and yells at me and is extremely upset that i didn‚Äôt make it on time. Even when i make it right on time she‚Äôll make some kind of remark like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre getting too close‚Äù or ‚Äúwatch yourself‚Äù 

Today i came home quite late, around 20 minutes over 11. I had even told her that I was going out to have a serious talk with my boyfriend (at a cafe that‚Äôs known to be safe and close by) and that i might be over the curfew. But as soon as i entered, she was visibly upset and raised her voice at me saying my curfew was going to be reduced to 10:30 now. 

i was obviously upset, but didn‚Äôt show it, as my mom is Korean and there‚Äôs somewhat of like this ‚Äúrespect‚Äù thing where ill never yell back or talk back to her. so i just nodded and listened to her as she kept yelling at me for being ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù , ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù and whatnot. So she tells me ‚Äú10:30, you need to be home.‚Äù To which I reply ‚ÄúI can make it by 11‚Äù. This is simply me standing up for myself, because simply i do think a 10:30 curfew at 21 is ridiculous. 

Then my mom goes to say that im being rebellious and that im ignoring what she was saying. To which I responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not rebelling against you, I‚Äôm simply communicating a boundary of a curfew time that I think is appropriate for me‚Äù. But then she yells back that im talking back, that I‚Äôm calling her a liar, and that it‚Äôs basically the same thing as being rebellious. 

I then ask her a question back- ‚Äúare you mad when i come home past my curfew because Im ‚Äúdisobeying‚Äú your rules or are you upset because you‚Äôre worried that im unsafe outside?

128,1e1c5wg,AITA for ending our friendship? ,"So I (M22) and my best friend let‚Äôs call her Chloe (F22) have been friends for about 5 years, we distanced for a while just because I left school and went to work and she did her own thing but early this year we rekindled and became best friends again and bonded over us both going through pretty rough breakups. 

We‚Äôd go out a lot and spend everyday together I‚Äôd tell her the stuff I‚Äôm getting on tinder and arguments in my life and vice versa. About 2 months ago she met this guy and things were great and they were spending a lot of time together and that turned into a relationship which was great, I met the dude and he was great we had a lot of similar interests and I was very happy for my best friend. It timed perfectly because I also met someone great and was spending more time with her than Chloe and mutually we were happy for each other. Chloe was concerned tho and said no matter what happens these relationships change nothing between us and that we both come first. 

That‚Äôs where she‚Äôs fucked up in my eyes. The dude she‚Äôs with idk let‚Äôs call him Nick (M28) has bipolar but later found out he is facing court I‚Äôm not gonna say what for, just for another layer of privacy, but he started to change his ways about a month ago and started drinking heavy everyday and taking bong hits. He started getting verbally aggressive towards her and she‚Äôd tell me everytime it happened at one point it was a daily occurrence. I‚Äôd give her advice to talk to him and see how he is but that just didn‚Äôt work and he only got worse.

Quite a few times he‚Äôs woke her up at 2am and asked ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of you being here if you are just gonna sleep?‚Äù  Keep in mind she was asleep because she had work in the morning and had to be up at 6am to get ready and leave his place to be in work by 8:30. It clearly affected her and she was suffering from it hard. She‚Äôs been in abusive relationships in the past and I guess she just gets used to it faster than anyone else would but I had started to tell her that this isn‚Äôt right and she needs to think for herself. Nick decided that weed and alcohol didn‚Äôt do it for him anymore and wanted to take mushrooms and cocaine so he messaged Chloe asking if it‚Äôs okay which she clearly said no and if you do im not coming over.  

Nick bought and took them anyways without Chloe knowing and made her drive him to the dealer and take him somewhere whilst Nick was high. He‚Äôd become paranoid and started texting this dealer asking if it‚Äôs noticeable and if she notices she was gonna leave him. Chloe took his phone and read all this and obviously furious took him home and forced herself in the uncomfortable situation of trip sitting him and slept for about an hour in total that night she also had work the next day too. He slept for 14 hours and woke up with no recollection of the night before. 

I told Chloe that‚Äôs not right and she needs to end things with him because he‚Äôs broke her trust and she agreed, then ended things that day.  She told him what I said then he messaged me and basically offered me to fight lmao. So to try and cheer her up I said I‚Äôll go get her and we will spend a few hours together to take her mind off things. While driving over she told me she‚Äôs going to his to talk things through but wanted me close by incase he got physical. The entire 30 minute drive down we stayed on a phone call and I said over and over this is a bad idea and nothing good can come from this at all. I had to wait 2 hours in my car around the corner and left because I wasn‚Äôt hearing anything from her. She rang me and followed me home and said she was going back that night and I just got upset because I just felt like he‚Äôs not gonna change his ways and she‚Äôs still trapped in this horrible place. 

Turns out I was right. I‚Äôve been helping my other best friend who‚Äôs more like a brother renovate his house for him and his pregnant girlfriend. Chloe would message me and FaceTime me a lot but I was busy so I never noticed they were calling. The FaceTime call was to tell me that she‚Äôs locked herself in his bathroom to get away from noise because he was drinking and playing music really loud and she asked to turn it down a little. Not change the song, not turn it off, just lower the sound. He apparently shouted at her to not touch the fucking volume so she locked herself away. She was on FaceTime to her other friend and apparently Nick came up to the bathroom door and beat fuck out of it and started calling her pathetic for wanting to get away from the noise. I again supported her the best I can and pushed her even more to ending it for her own benefit and she did. She was talking to new people and she seemed better but I could tell apart of her missed him and I understood but tried to help any way I could. 

After a few days he messaged her asking to talk again and she went to meet him. I got upset again because I knew it‚Äôs gonna be exactly the same as last time except me waiting around because I was working. We hadn‚Äôt spoke and she ended up staying the night at his. I just couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore and went no contact. Ik this is a trauma dump but I‚Äôve seen my mother go through domestic abuse both mental and physical and it‚Äôs not nice. I know how it‚Äôs changed me and my mother as people and I didn‚Äôt want that for Chloe at all, I was too young to help my mother but with Chloe I just can‚Äôt help her no matter what I do. 

She messaged me days later while with Nick asking if I am still angry. I blew up and said yes and I‚Äôm disappointed that she is doing this to herself just because he says he can change. Not being funny but 2 months and he‚Äôs doing this shit? Yeah good luck. But she threw it all back in my face and said that the day I followed her down, she thinks that I wanted something to happen to her. This made me blow up even more. Idk why it hurt me so badly but I just can‚Äôt fathom talking to her the way I did before. We were best friends with a lot of platonic love but she knew my past and to say that to me just feels like I‚Äôm not valued as the so called best friend pedestal I held her to. 

Idk I feel like I‚Äôm over reacting a little and I do miss her but I just don‚Äôt think I can see her the same way anymore.

131,1e1bagh,AITA for not knowing what to do with a gift my Mom gave me to help with my small business?,"I 23 female am trying to start a small business where I crochet baby outfits. I went out for coffee with my mom and her boyfriend and was telling them about the small business and how I was trying to figure out a good way to advertise the clothes without actually having a really baby to wear and model them. I told my Mom about reborn doll and how maybe I could use one of them as a model. That way it still looked like an actual baby but was not just a doll as I want the photos of the outfits to look professional and like a real baby is wearing them. I decided I would put that idea on the back burner for now and try to sell some of the clothes and save up some money to maybe buy one. But I was not sure if I really wanted to as the dolls are kinda creepy. Fast forward a week and my Mom gives me a text asking if I could come over the next day before work as she had something for me. When I got to her place she came out of the house with a bag and have it to me. On the outside of the bag it said reborn doll. My heart panicked a little as I realized she had bought me a reborn doll and I got a little worried as some of the reborn dolls did not look like real babies and looked more like dolls. As I opened the bag it was looking promising. The legs were chubby and pridy detailed along with the arms. But then it got to the face and it was kinda creepy. Its eyes were open and it had a grin on its face and the hair was thin and you could see all the poke holes made for the hair. I didn‚Äôt want her to see my disappointment. My mom was smiling and super excited about her purchase. She said after we had coffee her and her boyfriend talked about it and decided that I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait to save up first a reborn doll and that they would get it to help me out. I appreciate the thoughtfulness they had and how excited they were to help me with my small business. I feel awful.
I had before this coffee with my mom looked into the reborn dolls and knew that when I went to get one I would have to do a lot of researching to find the right one and spend a couple hundred bucks to get a realistic looking one. I had hoped to buy one with its eyes closed as I figure they looked more realistic and a bendable body that way I could pose it for pictures in the outfits.
My mom told me she had found the reborn doll on Amazon. My mom tried the best to convince me that this doll looked lifelike and had me take a couple pictures of her holding it. It looked like a doll. I feel so bad because I know that she wanted to help me and surprise me with this doll.

Am I The Asshole?
",No A-holes here,2024-07-12,"AITA for not knowing what to do with a gift my Mom gave me to help with my small business? I 23 female am trying to start a small business where I crochet baby outfits. I went out for coffee with my mom and her boyfriend and was telling them about the small business and how I was trying to figure out a good way to advertise the clothes without actually having a really baby to wear and model them. I told my Mom about reborn doll and how maybe I could use one of them as a model. That way it still looked like an actual baby but was not just a doll as I want the photos of the outfits to look professional and like a real baby is wearing them. I decided I would put that idea on the back burner for now and try to sell some of the clothes and save up some money to maybe buy one. But I was not sure if I really wanted to as the dolls are kinda creepy. Fast forward a week and my Mom gives me a text asking if I could come over the next day before work as she had something for me. When I got to her place she came out of the house with a bag and have it to me. On the outside of the bag it said reborn doll. My heart panicked a little as I realized she had bought me a reborn doll and I got a little worried as some of the reborn dolls did not look like real babies and looked more like dolls. As I opened the bag it was looking promising. The legs were chubby and pridy detailed along with the arms. But then it got to the face and it was kinda creepy. Its eyes were open and it had a grin on its face and the hair was thin and you could see all the poke holes made for the hair. I didn‚Äôt want her to see my disappointment. My mom was smiling and super excited about her purchase. She said after we had coffee her and her boyfriend talked about it and decided that I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait to save up first a reborn doll and that they would get it to help me out. I appreciate the thoughtfulness they had and how excited they were to help me with my small business. I feel awful.
I had before this coffee with my mom looked into the reborn dolls and knew that when I went to get one I would have to do a lot of researching to find the right one and spend a couple hundred bucks to get a realistic looking one. I had hoped to buy one with its eyes closed as I figure they looked more realistic and a bendable body that way I could pose it for pictures in the outfits.
My mom told me she had found the reborn doll on Amazon. My mom tried the best to convince me that this doll looked lifelike and had me take a couple pictures of her holding it. It looked like a doll. I feel so bad because I know that she wanted to help me and surprise me with this doll. I really wanted it to work but when I tried taking pictures of the doll in my crochet outfits it just looked like I had mad doll clothes instead of baby clothes. And I know my mom is expecting me to use this doll in my advertising but I don‚Äôt know how I could.

132,1e1b38n,AITA for asking my friends to take it easy with their PDA?,"So let me start off by saying that I don't think PDA is necessarily bad. I'm an affectionate guy myself, and when I'm an in a relationship I enjoy being physical with my partner very much. I do try to be respectful towards others when in a group setting. I personally believe a hug, a kiss once in a while or holding hands is all good. All the rest should be done behind close doors.

One of my friends, whom I have known for 18 years is in a two year relationship. He and his current gf are very sexual and they are also very open about the stuff they do in the bedroom. To the point of oversharing, it gets pretty graphic. So far I've witnessed them doing the following things: french kissing, groping, licking each others ears, whispering in each others ears, heard them having sex while staying over, etc. To be clear, this is all happening whenever we're hanging out with a group and even when I'm alone with them. I've confronted him previously multiple times about this behaviour and asked him if they could tone it down. Without any succes... 

Fast forward to a more recent event. A while ago we attended a four day music festival (5 people) and there we go: lots of french kissing, oversharing about how amazing their sex life is, groping and even stroking his dick under a blanket while sitting next to me. I had enough and confronted them about it. While staying calm, I politely asked them if they could stop doing those things in front of me. Then all of a sudden she starts giving me a lecture. The message was basically: fuck you, this is something we need to do and you'll just have to deal with it. It got pretty hostile. While staying calm, I thanked her for her honesty and said that I got the message. 

Needless to say, the next day i decided I wanted to be alone and went to enjoy the music festival on my own. Later that night I got into a fight with my friend, because I didn't say where I was and that I'm a bad friend. I saw a side of him that I never saw before. It felt like I was bickering with a 10 year old kid. From this moment I realized how long I've been putting up with his shitty behaviour and decided I don't need him in my life anymore. Am I the asshole for confronting my friends on their pda and asking them to respect my boundaries?

We still have twoish months to choose a name before she's born so I'm not that stressed. But I am frustrated because he has mentioned the name 10 different times now and I said no each time. Until I finally told him Elizabeth was on the official veto list and could not be brought back up again for consideration. I don't like the name and I find it highly overrated. He considers Elizabeth to be one of the best names and even went as far as telling me nobody can dislike the name, which I quickly corrected. He even ran a poll on his social media to prove to me I was alone in my dislike for the name. A lot of our family members apparently love the name. I know it's popular for a reason but it's not a name I ever cared for.

He considers me unreasonable and thinks the name offers a lot of nickname options so there's zero reason for me to say no. I told him if that's the case then every girl would be named Elizabeth. But I told him that doesn't happen so clearly there are other choices out there. He believes my reasons for disliking the name are petty; mostly to do with me finding the name boring and overused. The classic and timeless features of the name also hold no appeal to me which my husband finds annoying.

I am an incoming 4th year student. My parents have already given me responsibilities. Firstly, they did not invest in me. I am studying at a state university, pursuing a degree that is not really close to my heart because my older brother's degree was very expensive. My brother graduated two years ago and decided to start a family and get married. I own a small business that earns 20k or more per month (started it via loan), and I have been supporting myself since senior high school.

During a dinner last week, they mentioned that I should support my younger brother (in senior high school) through college since my older brother now has a family of his own to feed. I found this very irritating and lashed out. I told them that I would not do it because even though they are both retired, they can support  my younger brother because they have a successful business and they did not invest in me. At that time, they could clearly support both me and my brother, as well as a random kid at the same time. The program I was in was essentially tuition-free because I received a scholarship. The only issue was the miscellaneous fees.

Now, will I not be able to have a life and family after I graduate because I still have a brother to support? For the record, they did not say that to my brother when he was graduating; they even paid for his review for license for him to focus. I do not know why they are treating me like this - maybe because I am a girl or the middle child. They called me ungrateful and bitch. My whole family is against me; they kicked me out of the family and clan group chat. I guess I have been disowned. AITA?

Recently, I told my sister that I wouldn't be able to babysit every weekend anymore because I need some time for myself. She got really upset and accused me of being selfish and not caring about her family's needs. She said that she and her husband don't have anyone else to rely on and that I'm putting my own needs above the well-being of her children.

138,1e1a590,WIBTA for missing one of my best friends bachelor party because I am traveling abroad?,"Hello,
I am currently traveling the world for already 2 months with my gf. One of my best friends, let's call him ""Mike"", has his wedding pretty soon. Me and Mike had a conversation before my flight and I told him that I'll make it to the wedding so he shouldn't be worried. The wedding is planned for the 9th of August and I originally planned to come back few days before.
My gf was also invited to a family event that we should attend on August 4th so we agreed ahead to shorten the trip a little bit more and fly back home together on the first of August, so the schedule won't be too tight.
Here is the thing, I recently got invited to Mike's bachelor party which will take place on the 29th of July - and this will also be the first bachelor party of our boys. That means a flight on the 28th of July will be the latest one I can attend in order to make it in time.
I'm currently having a really good time and I really enjoy the trip. I feel like I don't really want to come back home but I have some ""real life"" things to do when I come back (other than the wedding).
I just don't know if to shorten the trip little bit more and cut my good time in order to make it in time for the bachelor party. If I do it, it will shorten my trip in ~4 days (3-5 days, depends on exact flights), which can be another cool destination I'll miss, or just more adventures, chill and fun.
More thing to add, is that the party itself is not only the ""boys"", it's a mixed party with all the bride's girl friends, so it feels just like a party and not something special (if that's a relevant information). On top of that, I feel like I don't really want to just get drunk or stoned, that's what they will probably do there, and I became not to be the biggest fan of that.
If I were Mike, I might be disappointed (I am not sure if it'll really disappoint him deeply or not) if a good friend will miss the party because of a 3-5 days of trip he won't want to shorten, and that he's already 2-2.5 months aborad.
Personally, I will enjoy more this 3-4 days extra trip than the bachelor party, but he's a good friend of mine and I might have guilt feelings or disappoint him.

141,1e19tv3,AITA for Taking the Master Bedroom on Vacation?,"Hi Reddit,
I went on a week-long vacation with a group of friends, and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm the asshole for taking the master bedroom. 


Here‚Äôs the context:

AirBnB house set up (cost was split equally however I planned and booked, paid the $700 security deposit myself):
Master bedroom with king size bed 
Guest room with queen size bed
Guest room with bunk bed
Attached guest suite with loft sleeping area that has king size bed 

The people in the group:
Myself, my 3 children
A friend and her husband
Another friend, her son, and boyfriend for a total of 9 people. 

I‚Äôm a single mom with 3 kids: a 15 year old, a 10-year-old and a 2-year-old toddler. My best friend is also on this trip with her 10-year-old son, her son has a history of bullying my 10 year old son which is a whole other can of worms. Because of this, I wanted to ensure my son felt safe and comfortable, so I decided to take the master bedroom with a king-size bed where I could sleep with both my 10 year old and toddler.
My best friend, on the other hand, has a boyfriend and insisted on having the master bedroom for themselves. However, there is a guest suite available that also has a king-size bed. I suggested that she and her boyfriend take that room (the other couple insisted that she took it as they had the guest suite last year), but she refused and became upset with me for not sharing the master bedroom or taking the smaller bed with my two kids (mind you the queen bed would not fit the 3 of us. I opted not to take the guest suite as it has a loft sleeping area and I was not comfortable without having a baby gate since the toddler and stairs could be dangerous. I brought a pack and play bed for the toddler that I thought might work for the smaller room if it became an issue; however, the pack and play is a mini one that was used when my toddler was younger and I did not check to see if he still fit in it before the trip. Not only did my toddler not comfortably fit in it, it also took up too much space in the guest room with the queen size bed. 

To complicate matters further, my best friend and her boyfriend have had a rocky year and their excessive drinking has become an issue. We were kind of anticipating there to be some drama on the trip. There was. The first night on vacation my best friend and her boyfriend came back late from a bar, drunk, and had a loud argument, disturbing everyone in the house, things escalated quickly and we were lucky police were not called. Her boyfriend ended up leaving the next morning and so just my best friend and her son remained. She‚Äôs mad at me for taking the master bedroom, but I feel like I had good reasons, especially considering her son‚Äôs behavior towards mine and my need for a larger bed for my kids.

So, Reddit, AITA for insisting on taking the master bedroom on this vacation?

143,1e19l3w,AITA for only inviting my older Nephew on a beach trip and not the rest of his family?,"AITA for only inviting my older nephew on a beach trip and not the rest of his family?

This might get wordy fast, so I'll jump right into it.

The plan was for my family of four and my best friend and her children to rent an airbnb near the beach during fall break this year. Unfortunately, when it came time to finalize plans she experienced some major events (a move and then loss of job) and its likely she won't be able to come.

My husband and I went ahead and rented the house anyway, because we got a lot of early bird/off season discounts. I still hope she can come, because her children and mine are best friends. 

However, I wanted to invite my older nephew. He's 13, and goes camping with us all the time. Like of the last 14 trips we have taken, he's only missed 3. 

My sister, his mother, has never cared and actually been grateful because she hates camping. She isn't a fan of tents, bugs, the outside and that's okay with me. My nephew's father is not in the picture and hasn't been since he was 4, so he's latched on to my husband for a lot of 'guy stuff'. 

I asked Emmet along and he was really excited and has started talking about all the things he would like to try on the beach- ocean fishing, cleaning and eating what he catches, a bonfire, tidepools, etc. I reminded him that I will have to ask his mom for permission and he calmed down. 

When i did ask my sister she went kind of quiet and said that she would like to go too. I said I would  have to talk to my husband, but there are a lot of reasons why I don't want her to go. She can be a Karen, and I'm afraid she would disrespect the rules of the airbnb and cause us trouble, she has the habit of leaving whenever she wants and staying gone for hours and the worst is she would have to bring my younger nephew Carson. Carson is 3 and absolutely despises my younger daughter. He's jealous of anyone not playing with  him and screams at a pitch that makes my ears ring. He and my youngest fight whenever they're with each other and it escalates to hitting biting and scratching. 

My husband thinks that this might be a good family trip and maybe the young cousins will be having so much fun they won't fight but I doubt it. One solution he offered was to have a weekend getaway at a cabin just to see how it would go but it would be 100% financed by us and I really don't want to pay for a free vacation for my sister and her family when she has never done anything for me like that. She wouldn't even cover my drink at a coffee shop, tbh. But in my mind, having her and my younger nephew would ruin this vacation for me. 


EDIT; hi everyone, I wanted to address some repeated questions and add clarity. 
Since 2019, when we would ask to take my nephew on various types of camping trips, from tents, yurts, and screen shelters to luxury cabins, my sister has not wanted to go. We went to some really cool places, better than the ocean, imo. Lake Ouachita, broken bow, Big Bend, even a nice cabin on top of Palo Duro canyon, and she was never interested. After nearly two years of asking her first she started snapping at me to just ask him. So for the past several years, I just say things like ""Hey Emmett, we are going to camp at the lake, wanna go?"" Of ""Hey, we are going to go ride a train through Northern Arkansas and dig for diamonds, you in?"" And it's been like that for years since. So this sudden desire to go was really surprising. 

I will be taking her out for lunch next week and I'll talk with her then.

Fast forward to March of this year, I was on call with R and he added W to the call, whilst R and I were playing a game together and W joined us.

152,1e17x9b,AITA  for over reacting when my parents kept teasing me about my parenting,"AITA for getting upset after my family kept teasing me about my parenting

AITA for not thinking my family‚Äôs teasing about my baby was is funny?

My husband, me, and our 15 month old daughter went on a little vacation for the Fourth of July with my side of the family. I love my family, but it can be hard to spend a long extended period of time with them. This is because they love to tease anyone about everything they can. That is the way I grew up, so I am not against a bit of teasing when everyone is having fun, but there is a line that they cross sometimes. 

Me and my husband are first time parents, so we are pretty protective of our child. We try and make sure she is not eating too much sugar or junk food and that she gets what she needs to grow. We don‚Äôt deprive her of these things, but we don‚Äôt let her eat too much. In my eyes, she is still a baby and I want her to have a good start to life. 

We were on a little excursion with my parents, sister, and some aunts and uncles. We all packed lunches for our own families and I had packed chips in our lunch. When my daughter got hungry she started nibbling on her sandwich and having a few chips. My parents packed a big bag of candy for everyone to share and I told them that our daughter was a bit too young for the candy in the bag and to not give her any. As I was eating I look back and what is in her mouth, the lollipop that my mom had. I was not happy and I said as much. My dad brushed me off and proceeded to mock me and call me strict. I hear the rest of my family come in and start to tease me about it. When she was done with the lollipop she started eating again. A bit of time when by and I said she had enough chips and she needed to finish her sandwich. My family said everything was fine and to look how much fun she was having. My mom also said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can keep them away from her.‚Äù She‚Äôs a baby, just take the bag away and keep it out of reach. My dad then said, ‚Äúyou should see the things we give her when you are not around.‚Äù When I gave him an ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù look, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kidding.‚Äù 

At this point my husband had enough and went to get our daughter. My parents gave him a weird look and said, ‚Äúis that really necessary?‚Äù I stood up for him saying, ‚Äúwhen it comes to our daughter and what we think is right for her, yes it is.‚Äù They proceeded to talk about us and throw weird looks our way. We had the option to leave the excursion or stay for longer. My family wanted to stay, but me, my husband, and my daughter left to cool off. My family kept talking about how it was rude to just leave after we were gone and how we over reacted. 

I did raise my voice at them when they weren‚Äôt listening to me. My husband also got a bit angry as well. My mom and dad are still acting weird it and refuses to see any fault in themselves.

We go for a two week family gathering with my wife‚Äôs family every summer.    There are 13 of us - we will have maybe two shared meals a day, so maybe 25 meals over the course of the two weeks.   These meals for 13 take a good deal of work to prepare, and to clean up afterwards.    Everybody chips in except her brother‚Äôs eldest son, he is 14, and just rather lazy.  Never lifts a finger to help.      Nice enough guy, just a bit spoiled and indulged by his parents.   

So on meals where I do the principal cleanup,  I‚Äôve started asking him if he would like to help me to do the dishes - at first he would politely decline - like almost shocked that anybody would ask him to do anything.    But  now he gets rather annoyed by my asking him and it‚Äôs become kind of like a joke between us.  Like I don‚Äôt even say anything, if just ask ‚Äúis THIS the night?‚Äù     The rest of the family says nothing - they laugh a bit.   Like it‚Äôs the unspoken thing nobody mentions.       It now to the point where I‚Äôm asking him is it okay with him that nobody expects him to lift a finger.     Like  does he have a special pass here - is he some sort of Royalty, what?

AITA for asking my wife‚Äôs nephew to pitch in and help a little?

We go for a two week family gathering with my wife‚Äôs family every summer.    There are 13 of us - we will have maybe two shared meals a day, so maybe 25 meals over the course of the two weeks.   These meals for 13 take a good deal of work to prepare, and to clean up afterwards.    Everybody chips in except her brother‚Äôs eldest son, he is 14, and just rather lazy.  Never lifts a finger to help.      Nice enough guy, just a bit spoiled and indulged by his parents.   

So on meals where I do the principal cleanup,  I‚Äôve started asking him if he would like to help me to do the dishes - at first he would politely decline - like almost shocked that anybody would ask him to do anything.    But  now he gets rather annoyed by my asking him and it‚Äôs become kind of like a joke between us.  Like I don‚Äôt even say anything, if just ask ‚Äúis THIS the night?‚Äù     The rest of the family says nothing - they laugh a bit.   Like it‚Äôs the unspoken thing nobody mentions.       It now to the point where I‚Äôm asking him is it okay with him that nobody expects him to lift a finger.     Like  does he have a special pass here - is he some sort of Royalty, what?

157,1e1714h,AITA for reconnecting to my childhood bestfriend?,"I have no idea if this is the right sub for this (super detailed)

I (Female), had a childhood bestfriend (Male 2 years older) who was the closest friend to me let‚Äôs call him Mark, since we both lived abroad and had the same ethnicity, our parents were friends and the whole deal. 

Mark and I were very close while growing up and I, unfortunately, had a crush on him for years, never knowing his true feelings for years on end. 
Mark moved away and left the country to return to our home country when we were younger shortly I had to return to our home country too, and in that time we were still entering puberty, and all that. 
I had the fattest crush on that man,he was always dating at that time, so I never said it anyway. 

When I moved back to our home country, I had severe depression and since I was young, it was uncontrollable and painful for everyone around me too, but I was only calm with him, I was like 13, and he was the only source of support I had, so whenever I had deletion tendencies he would help me, honestly, I was overwhelming and I would always be on the verge of self deletion whenever I could, it was not healthy for either of us.

In that period, he introduced me to his friends where I met a boy that I used to get over Mark, I dated him, for a long time. (Shitty move I know. I was a child please bear with me)
I got closer to all of his friends and opened up my sick mind to all of them, and it was.. not fun. Since they were all older than I was, and I got the slap of reality I needed that time. 
Back to the boy I dated, we were fine, for a long time until my father found out, (Im in a very conservative family and my father is very strict), I got the scolding of my life and I had to cut off contact with everyone and changed my number. 

After that, there were a few months where I was still in contact with Mark, only a few texts, because I felt like I ruined his friendship with the others with my behavior, and we slowly completely lost contact. 

That was 3 years ago now, and I‚Äôve became very healthy and stable minded, I used to stalk him here and there, afraid of reaching out, and guilt ridden by my own sickness, and a few months ago, I had the bravery to apologize for everything that I did in a long text, and he was fine. (can‚Äôt thank him enough.)

Today I met him, with his family accidentally (younger brother, younger sister, a cousin I was close with), and I lost my mind. My parents didn‚Äôt lose contact with his parents so it was fine for them, but I was so awkward and terrified.

I hung out with them a little bit, tried not to be awkward, it didn‚Äôt feel like he was awkward like he was fine? He kept talking to me normally and I was really grateful for that.
I didn‚Äôt understand what I felt, but I tried to ease the tension slowly by talking to his baby sister and cousin and brother, and that was all. I took his contact and his social media again, and that‚Äôs it. 

I feel very shitty, and I know I was wrong when I was younger, I‚Äôm not excusing my actions but I was really really out of it and depressed, like it was terrifyingly worrying to be around me. 

I‚Äôm too scared to do anything, and I know we won‚Äôt return like our past, but I can‚Äôt help but want it. 
What can I do? I‚Äôm so worried, and I feel like I‚Äôm burdening him all over again. I‚Äôm also scared of him telling his friends because they (probably) hated me for cutting contact with all of them for no reason even my ‚Äòex.‚Äô

I‚Äôm wondering if I WBTA if I uninvited a groomsman this close to the wedding. For reference, he has already paid to rent his suit. We would most likely reimburse him or find someone else to take the rental. 

One of our groomsmen recently joined TikTok and I added him, as my fianc√© and him are close friends from childhood, my fianc√© was in his wedding, and we have gone out with him and his wife quite a few times.  

One day I see a reposted video from his page making transphobic comments. I go to his page and his reposted videos are FILLED with homophobic videos, transphobic, racist, sexist content. 

I showed this to my fianc√© who was shocked. We had never seen this side of him at all.

Part of the issue is that I am bisexual. He most likely does not know this, since I‚Äôm in a straight relationship. The hurtful and aggressive things he has been saying online scare me and make me very uncomfortable to be around him at this point. 

With only 3 months to the wedding, would I be the asshole for uninviting him? I feel uncomfortable being around this person, since he thinks I should die due to my sexual identity. I feel literally sick to my stomach thinking about him being there. 

The other issue is that he is in a friend group with my fianc√©, who is worried about there being backlash on him for taking back him being a groomsman.

3) I didn't just force myself into the situation ( I know it's not my relationship so not my business ) I was brought into it since I'm close with them all.

4) I didn't just assume that Liam wanted help since over the years he's all welcome people telling him if people are talking about him (because of past stuff that's happened)

We both work part time but I'm the one that makes more money so I pay 70% of the mortgage and 50% of all other house expenses. The reason for him being part-time is because he is still going to college so I don't mind. My job is considered part time since I only work and get paid when students go to school but I work 40 hrs a week.

Before moving in together we went to a class for engaged couples at his church. There they taught us to come to an agreement of house chores if we were going to split them. We had already decided on what each one was going to do. Everything was good for the first six months. Now, ever since he finished last semester and started doing wholesales which is already 3 months he hasn't helped me at all. I get that he works his normal job plus wholesales and I'm on summer break but he expects me to do everything around the house and help him, organize all his paperwork, write down all the houses he door knocks, write offers to people, write and send letters plus write all foreclosure houses. 

Today, I had to go buy some groceries I needed to cook lunch and ended up coming home late and didn't have food ready, but that's only because he told me he was going to go door knock right after work. Well, he came home, right after work (2:30pm) he didn't get mad about the food. Everything was good until he asked if I had done any more letters and I told him no. He then proceeded to ask why I haven't done them and what was I doing all day. The way he said it upset me and I started telling him everything I do and that he doesn't help with house chores anymore and that I felt like his maid.

He got mad and started telling me that I was just a spoiled woman and lazy, which yes I am lazy but I still get stuff done. He continued saying that I didn't appreciate him and he works a lot for us to have more money and for me to not have to work anymore and get me my engagement ring and wedding I want. We started having a discussion and haven't talked to each other since then, I feel like I am at fault but at the same time I don't.

My job is considered part time since I only work and get paid when students go to school but I work 40 hrs a week.

Before moving in together we went to a class for engaged couples at his church. There they taught us to come to an agreement of house chores if we were going to split them. We had already decided on what each one was going to do. Everything was good for the first six months. Now, ever since he finished last semester and started doing wholesales which is already 3 months he hasn't helped me at all. I get that he works his normal job plus wholesales and I'm on summer break but he expects me to do everything around the house and help him, organize all his paperwork, write down all the houses he door knocks, write offers to people, write and send letters plus write all foreclosure houses. 

Today, I had to go buy some groceries I needed to cook lunch and ended up coming home late and didn't have food ready, but that's only because he told me he was going to go door knock right after work. Well, he came home, right after work (2:30pm) he didn't get mad about the food. Everything was good until he asked if I had done any more letters and I told him no. He then proceeded to ask why I haven't done them and what was I doing all day. The way he said it upset me and I started telling him everything I do and that he doesn't help with house chores anymore and that I felt like his maid.

He got mad and started telling me that I was just a spoiled woman and lazy, which yes I am lazy but I still get stuff done. He continued saying that I didn't appreciate him and he works a lot for us to have more money and for me to not have to work anymore and get me my engagement ring and wedding I want. We started having a discussion and haven't talked to each other since then, I feel like I am at fault but at the same time I don't. So, AITA for asking more from  him even after having 1 job and doing wholesales?

Forgot to mention, I finished college but didn't like my profession anymore. Last month I spent it studying to get a license for residential loans so that I can get a better job.",0.0,0.031941745430231094,0,1
163,1e168xo,AITA - For getting a tattoo,"AITA - I  have been married for 22 years when I got married I had a tattoo. I have over the course of our 22 years gotten 2 other tattoos. One for a milestone in my life and one with our children‚Äôs name. I have them placed in locations that can easily be covered up. One on my back, one on my wrist and one on my foot. I wanted to get to a tattoo to represent my grandmother who passed away. This one is placed on my chest near my shoulder. Since I have three already I didn‚Äôt see the issue in getting another one. When my husband saw the tattoo he got very upset and told me they are disgusting and he never wanted to touch me again. I was gobsmacked. This new tattoo is small fine line tattoo with a really beautiful flower. So I asked him what‚Äôs the issue I already have 3 he stated he didn‚Äôt have to look at the other ones when he is ‚Äúwith‚Äù me. He has always said in the past it‚Äôs my body and it‚Äôs ok. But now he has decided that because I got this tattoo that I don‚Äôt want to be with him and don‚Äôt love him because he has decided he doesn‚Äôt like them and has decided they are not ‚Äúattractive‚Äù. I thought it was fine I even mentioned getting it before I did and he said that‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs your body. I didn‚Äôt know that was his way of saying he didn‚Äôt like them.

164,1e1652w,AITA for not helping a little kid pick up her chair at a restaurant while I was eating my food,"Background: I‚Äôm 15 and on a family vacation in South Carolina. And I‚Äôm at a busy restaurant outdoors. I ordered chicken wings form this restaurant. 

This post isn‚Äôt super serious I just want to know if I was really in the wrong or not. Basically I‚Äôm sitting at the table with my family (stepdad, mom, grandpa, grandma) I‚Äôm eating chicken wings and they are all talking, then suddenly there is a loud bang behind us. It was a little kid, they were playing with a chair and it fell. The kid wasn‚Äôt on the chair and they didn‚Äôt get hurt or anything. It was one of those tall bar chairs type chair. My stepdad said I should go help her. I said no, because my hands were dirty and I didn‚Äôt feel like getting up and walking over to help her pick it up. A couple seconds later her parents helped her pick the chair back up and I really didn‚Äôt think it was that big of a deal. But then my family started giving me shit, it started with my stepdad who basically said to me ‚Äúhey man that‚Äôs not cool, you should‚Äôve helped pick that kids chair up, you need to learn some common manners.‚Äù My stepdad always gives me shit especially on this trip. Then my grandpa starts and says, ‚Äúone day when you are on a date with a lady and that happens she will leave and you‚Äôll be known as the jerk.‚Äù My mom added on to this by saying ‚Äúyeah girls like guys that actually have good manners.‚Äù  I really didn‚Äôt think it was that serious. It made me kinda mad because it felt like I was getting ganged up on for something so minor

I ask why it is so bad, and they mess with me, saying ‚Äúcause it sucks‚Äù. 

Then, I said the thing that set everything in motion: ‚ÄúL [A]‚Äù. For context, we often call eachother ‚ÄúL‚Äù, as we see it as a low level insult, less than ‚Äúyou suck‚Äù. A says ‚ÄúFreak you‚Äù with some other childish insults. I said, sorry and just said the little amount of description for the game wasn't helping.

I said I'm not even upset with him, and A says he's confused because I said ‚ÄúL‚Äù. He says it‚Äôs stupid to call someone ‚ÄúL‚Äù and not mean it. I said it doesn't even mean much, it's a letter.

167,1e15eo6,AITA For telling my sister that she needs therapy if she can‚Äôt get over being teased one time in middle school?,"(This whole situation is so dumb I‚Äôm contemplating even posting about it on here.)

Backstory is that my sister Layla used to be friends with a girl named Gracie. Layla and Gracie went into new friend groups in middle school. And I guess Gracie and her new friend group called Layla ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù and laughed at her because Layla used to play with Barbies.

Our mom talked to Gracie‚Äôs mom who had Gracie apologize. That was the end of it. Nothing else happened after that. No contact since they were 12. I‚Äôm not even sure if they went to the same high school.¬†

Now Layla‚Äôs telling me that she‚Äôs in a fight with her friend Tyler because Gracie happens to now be in the DND club that Tyler runs. Tyler is vouching for Gracie and saying she‚Äôs cool, but Layla‚Äôs basically demanding that Gracie be kicked out and saying Tyler's choosing her ""bully"" over his friend.

I told Layla that if I were Tyler, I‚Äôd tell Layla to forget it and stay home. I basically reiterated what I said in the title and above. Which is that it‚Äôs so dumb to refuse to be in a club and still judging someone over something they did at 12. And if she‚Äôs caught up over being teased one time in middle school as a 20-year-old then she needs therapy¬†

Layla‚Äôs calling me an asshole and saying I wasn‚Äôt her and have no idea how embarrassing it was to be treated that way by a former friend. I still think it‚Äôs absurd that Layla‚Äôs making this big of a deal out of it and demanding Gracie be kicked out when she hasn‚Äôt had any contact with her since middle school or could just stay home herself. AITA?

Edited because I should probably clarify:

* Layla is not a part of the DND club. She asked Tyler to join, which is when he gave her the info of everyone in it and learned that Gracie was already a member of this club. Layla is technically intruding on the group that Gracie was already in.
* Nothing happened beyond the one Barbie incident at 12. I'm certain if anything else happened, Layla would have brought it up in her justification of why Tyler should kick Gracie out. But she just keeps bringing up the Barbie incident over and over. If being teased impacted her that much, then she could surely try talking to Gracie? Especially when Tyler is vouching for her and it sounds like she isn't the same person from middle school?
* This only became my business after Layla tried to get me involved and agree with her that Gracie should be kicked out. I won't lie that she's right when she's wrong to keep the peace. Someone who doesn't care may do that to appease her in the moment, but it will only cause more issues for my sister in the future.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-12,"AITA For telling my sister that she needs therapy if she can‚Äôt get over being teased one time in middle school?
