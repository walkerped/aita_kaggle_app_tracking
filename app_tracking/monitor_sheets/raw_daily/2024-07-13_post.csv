0,1e2h3qt,AITA for blowing up at my mum?,"Me (18nb, they/them) and my mum (53f) have always had a rocky relationship. From 2015-2021 (I was 9-15), she was completing a part-time master's program while working full-time. She was basically never home, and my dad became our primary caregiver. She even skipped family outings to write her thesis, which led me to bond more with my dad than with her.

While I'm incredibly proud of her for getting her master's, it felt like she chose her education over our relationship. People around me thought she was dead because she was never present. When I was honest with her about my feelings, she'd get overwhelmed and blow up at me. She never really got to know me beyond age 9 and still sees me as the little girl I was.

It became even more difficult when I came out as non-binary. She supports me, but she only sees things from her perspective, leading to many verbal fights. For instance, my periods are terrible, causing depression and heavy cramps, but she didn't understand and called me dramatic because her experiences were different. Similarly, I used to hate my larger breasts and wanted a binder, but she couldn't understand my feelings since she always wanted bigger breasts herself. This continued until my dad sat her down. 

Despite these challenges, our relationship has improved over the last year. We've gone on a trip together, and she's been more understanding and respectful of my boundaries. However, a recent incident caused a major fight.

A few weeks ago, I found out my extremely Catholic grandma (mum's mum) had stopped putting money into a savings account she made for me when I was born. I discovered this when I finally accessed the account at 18 and saw my little brother had more money, indicating she stopped contributing around the time I came out. This hurt deeply because, despite her disapproval of my identity, I thought we were very close.

When I told my mum, she called me shallow. I tried to explain it wasn't about the money but about grandma not accepting me. This led to a fight, and I stormed out. I understand my mum's reluctance to confront grandma because they had a huge fight years ago and only reconciled when mum was pregnant with me. She's afraid of losing her mum again. However, in the moment, I got really mad and told her she was choosing grandma over me, like she chose her master's over our relationship.

I told my uncle (mum's brother) what happened and he got really mad. He has his own complicated relationship with our family as a bisexual man and called both grandma and mum to scold them for their behavior when he thought I was asleep. Since then, more and more people have been getting involved and my mum's phone has been calling non-stop. I understand that my grandma is old and set in her ways but it still really hurt she doesn't accept me. On top of that it hurt that my mum made me feel guilty for being sad and mad. 

I think my words might have ruined our relationship, but I really don't know anymore.

3,1e1xseg,AITA for asking my aunt to stop smoking at my birthday table?,"I (16M) had my birthday recently. I had invited some of my close friends to hang out and eat together. My parents invited some extended family (cousins, uncles and aunts that lived in the same town).

To give some background, in my house smoking is forbidden, and I personally believe that those rules should also apply to guests. To add onto that, I have nasal polyps that are pretty large, which mess with my hearing, my tonsils and most importantly they cause difficulty breathing. Combining that with the heat and humidity of the summer, I feel suffocated constantly, even in fresh, clean air, in non-urban zones.

At around 8-9 PM, my aunt, who wasn't even invited, but forced her ex-husband, who was invited, to take her with him and their two sons. 

She decides to sit right next to me (Our table was outdoors), which didn't bother me, but then she lights up her cigarette and starts smoking. Both me and my best friend are heavily bothered by the smoke so I ask her to not smoke while sitting at the table in the most polite way I could without seeming like cowardly (Due to having severe social anxiety when I was in middle school, which I thankfully overcame, some family members still see me as a coward and way to shy for a ""man""). She starts yelling at me saying stuff such as: ""This is how you treat guests?"", ""It's not indoors, so what's it to you?"". I respond by saying that a guest must follow the host's rules. Obviously, arguing with her would've lead nowhere so in the end me and my friends go and take a walk. I speak to my mom before leaving, telling her my point of view.

Once we come back, my mom tells me what she heard from my aunts. Apparently I'm in the wrong for bashing her and that from her point of view I was very rude and that it's her right to smoke, especially outdoors. 

My mom didn't respond and she just said that she'll talk to me, but I didn't get scolded or anything. Actually, she sided with me. After the party my father scolded me for being ""weak"" and not ""understanding how the real world functions"" after telling him that I do not want to see ever her at my home.

4,1e1xrip,AITA for cancelling my mother‚Äôs planned visit after billing me?,"My mother (65) came to visit me (39f), her daughter, after I called her to share the news I received some troubling news about my health (I‚Äôm on the mend, worst is behind me). 

She lives approximately 2 hours away from me. During the visit she signalled she planned to charge me for parking fees at the clinic she brought me to, among a couple of other expenses that she incurred helping me out that day. I was fine with that. She‚Äôs not exactly swimming in it after retiring, though has some discretionary income, and, well, I‚Äôm a grown-up. In fact, I would have taken care of the parking fees (and other expenses) myself at the time if I wasn‚Äôt incapacitated. So totally fine and expected. 


Where I stopped being fine was when she called me after the visit asking for a lot more money than I‚Äôd expected. After probing a bit, I discovered that she‚Äôd lumped in there an estimate of how much she‚Äôd spent on gas to come visit me and not just the pasta salad she bought for me at lunch (totally fine) but also the pasta salad she bought herself. I‚Äôm happy to treat her for lunch, and often do‚Äîtreated her for dinner that very night‚Äîbut I found it odd she would just go ahead and add her lunch to the bill. I hadn‚Äôt offered and aren‚Äôt I the sick one? It was only 20 bucks altogether.

 But the reason I cancelled her visit tomorrow to come over and help some more was because I couldn‚Äôt believe she‚Äôd pass on her gas expenses to her sick adult child to visit her. When she said she was coming to visit after learning of my condition, she omitted the part of her plan where she‚Äôd charge me for her gas to get here. Sure, she complained about the cost of gas when she arrived, but never did she share her plan to make me cover it. 

She‚Äôs never done anything like this before. It‚Äôs not the money. It‚Äôs the principle. And I had no intention of paying for her to visit me tomorrow, too. I plan on sharing with her my feelings about all of this once I‚Äôve given some thought to how I‚Äôll navigate it with her. I would feel so ashamed as a parent if roles were reversed. This whole thing makes me question why I haven‚Äôt billed her when I‚Äôve gone to visit her after falling ill. Of course I could never bring myself to actually do that. The thought of it makes me feel sick. So AITA for cancelling her visit? 

Edit: thank you all for weighing in. Many of you have encouraged me to probe her financial situation further, or consider her mental state. All good advice. I will do so when I speak with her about this. That said, I‚Äôm confident she is doing fine financially. While retired, she regularly goes out to lunch with her friends, sees plays, goes on a couple trips annually (she has a trip to Italy to look forward to in the Fall), etc. So while her income may be modest now that she‚Äôs retired, she‚Äôs not in dire straits financially as some of you wondered. As one commentor pointed out, she may just have a ‚Äúquirky‚Äù relationship with money. I could see that. While this is the first time that she‚Äôs billed me for her gas to visit me, she‚Äôs treated other family members like this for other expenses, despite their not treating her that way. She can get anxious, so there may be something there in terms of mental health for me to be aware of. Appreciate the comments encouraging me to look more at things from this angle. To be sure, she did visit out of love. She was terribly worried about me and genuinely wanted to look after me that day. I‚Äôll update again after having the convo with her.

7,1e1wz4m,AITA for leaving early for the train station without my friend?,"I (24M) recently went with a close friend \[let's call her\] Maddie (22F) on a short trip to the coast. We stayed for three days and everything went well, we had lots of fun and generally enjoyed our time there. However, everything went downhill on the last day when we were supposed to go back.

Very early that day, another mutual friend of ours \[let's call her\] Abbie messaged Maddie saying that she would be passing by the coast that day with a friend of hers, and that we should meet. Since we had nothing else to do while we waited for the time to catch the train to go home, we agreed to meet.

The thing was that that day it was a complete downpour, and for some reason bus services were not going around, and neither were there a lot of taxis, so we had to meet on foot along the way. It was short of miserable but funny at the same time, having to walk against the rain and the wind along the coast. At some point we eventually met, and we had to go back to dry up in a local arcade, as we were completely soaked.

While we were there, things started to turn strange to me. Both Maddie and Abbie were asking me constantly if I was okay, to which I answered I was every time, getting confused as to why they kept asking. After that, they kept to their own playing on the arcade machines. At some point I realised it was getting dangerously close to the train leaving time, and the rain wasn't stopping at all, so I stood up and tried to tell Maddie that we had to leave.

She said the didn't want to, and that she wanted to stay a little longer. I said okay and waited a few more minutes, but seeing how the rain didn't calm down at all, I approached them again and said that I would be leaving now because I wanted to dry up on the train station before the train left, and that she could catch up with me on the train station if she wanted to stay on the arcade a bit longer. She said ""Yeah, okay"", to which I said okay, so I left.

When I got to the train station, I took my phone out and saw that she had left me some messages. In short, she was in disbelief that I had ""Actually left without her"". I was very confused as we agreed to meet here, but she kept saying on how much disbelief she was and that I should be ashamed of leaving her there. I told her that I didn't see the issue at all, but that just made her get more angry and make snarky comments.  
  
At some point the conversation was going nowhere, and I was worried about how she was going to get back if she missed the train, so I kept trying to get her to meet halfway or anything that would help. She, however, decided that she would come back on a bus with the ""people I left her with"" and just continued to make snarky remarks. I got upset at this point, so I just told her ""Congratulations"" and stopped texting then.

8,1e1wxts,AITA for possibly getting my roommate uninvited to a party,"Me (29M) and my roommate (30M), have known each other since the 7th grade and have had the same close circle of friends since. I moved in with him about 3 years ago and things are good.  

A 29M mutual friend throws an annual house party and we are always invited. I am a bit closer to our friends as I've grown up more with them than him. With the party in mind, my roommate had been looking forward to it all year as he got to be around all our friends from school. We live in NY and our friends are in NJ for the most part so it's rare to have everyone together plus the 100+ people that show up throughout the day.  

A week before the party he had asked another mutual friend (29F) if she was going to the party. 29F was not made aware of the party and was not invited this year. This friend in particular is someone my roommate met through the host and in my opinion, he only talks to her whenever convenient.  

My roommate made me aware of the situation and while I laughed at his blunder, we realized he was in a pickle. Since I'm close to the host I reached out in a chat to help my roommate get a clear answer. I had written, ""Did you invite 29F? Because my roommate did lol"". Trying to be playful in my delivery but,I see my words were deceitful in that he did not particularly invite but made her aware of it accidentally. Still, some of us laughed.  

The host made it clear she was indeed not invited and not allowed to come. The host then showed my roommate my message and laid it flat that it was now his problem and he had to tell her she can't come even though she was already looking for a costume to wear to the party by this point. (It's Disney theme. I'm bringing the keyblade from KH.)  

After 2 days my roommate finally texted her that she can't come and that unfortunately, he doesn't make the rules. She was upset she was made aware of a party she wasn't invited to and was even more upset that the host she had known for years refused to let her be invited. My roommate was not going to fight for her spot at the party and let it go.  

29F friend had made another friend aware of this and that friend had messaged the host about it. The host had become furious to have to put up with this still and still had ultimately uninvited my roommate on the count of being ""a messy idiot"". Many of the people involved think it is weird my roommate is even talking to her since they're not really friends and he should've just brought the girl he has been seeing for months instead. 

I feel bad. Say it was another person he had asked, he probably wouldn't be uninvited. It just turns out this one person he asked was just not invited and my roommate did not know about the issues between the parties. I've asked to have his invitation reinstated since the party means a big deal to him.

A couple of days ago, my friend came over to replace my broken phone screen because he offered to help me with it. When he arrived, I gave him some weed so we could chill before he started. We chatted while he worked, and decided to hang out afterward since neither of us had plans the next day.

He finished replacing my screen around 10:30 PM and wanted to smoke to celebrate. I didn't have much left, so I offered him half so we could both roll one. He told me he wanted all of it. I said no because I needed my half for my last two joints of the day. He seemed upset, said he would go home, and declined my offer to walk to the shop together to get more. He was noticeably upset that I didn't give him all of it.

Now, I'm left with doubts. On one hand, I feel I was fair since I had been sharing my weed regularly and even offered to share half of what I had left. On the other hand, he replaced my phone screen, and maybe he felt he deserved a bit more for that.

11,1e2ogon,AITA for telling my dad he isn't invited to my party?,"
My birthday is coming up on Monday and this whole month has been a mess because I'm having a problem with my dress but my mom said she will figure something out. 

My mom and our family were the ones to set up every for my birthday, my dad did nothing to chip in. My mom asked him if he could help with the expense but he argued that he didn't want to so she had to do everything on her own, I never understood why my dad had such a problem when it came to helping my mom.

This is how it has always been, when it comes to paying child support he complains about having to pay for me, doesn't buy me clothes, and lets his wife disrespect me and my mom. When I had special events he never made it because he had his new family, he took care of kids that weren't his. I find that ridiculous actually because you have a problem with taking care of your bio kid but okay with strangers kids?

My dad said he would come with his wife and kids but I don't feel like he should be here, he didn't do anything to help with the party. He wanted to bring his stepkids and I told him no because they, were not my family, he said I was being mean to him and I should give him respect. 

Honestly, I want my family there only, the family that has been there for me and helped me, not someone that comes and goes when they want. I told him he wasn't invited and that should have been the end of things but he saw it as a problem, yelling at me on my phone because I told him no, I hung up because he should take my answer even if he doesn't like it.

I‚Äôm very upset as I‚Äôm writing this so there might be errors so pls bear with me.

On a 1 week family vacation, 
My parents and brothers couldn‚Äôt make it, so I‚Äôm here wishing I had stayed home.

My dad got me a room at the hotel we were all staying, so I could have a room to myself. (The last vacation I had to share a room with 2 of my cousins, & I had been uncomfortable)
My cousins (32F), I‚Äôll call her Jo her husband I‚Äôll call him Bill and their 2 kids had the room next to mine. 
The first night had been quiet.
The next day my cousins and I wanted to go to the beach and whatever, Jo had asked if she could stay in my room bcos she wanted to rest a bit and her husband and kids were disturbing her in their room. I said sure and gave her my room card. 
We were gone for like the whole day, when we returned, Jo was still in my room. She had been watching TV, she had actually rented a movie!!! I was angry at this bcos it was my dad‚Äôs credit card on the billing for the room , she apologized and left. 
The next day she asked to use my room again, promised not to rent a movie or anything and I agreed.
When I returned, Bill was in my room laying on my bed. I wasn‚Äôt mad, but I also didn‚Äôt like it. I asked them to leave that I needed to get ready since we were all going out to eat.

We‚Äôre at the restaurant eating, joking around having a nice time, when my aunt (Jo‚Äôs mom) [the official ‚Äúadult‚Äù of the family vacay] said and I quote ‚Äúso you‚Äôll be sleeping in Jo‚Äôs room with the kids so your elder sister and her husband can have some privacy‚Äù. 
I honestly didn‚Äôt think she was talking to me until her husband snapped at me asking if I was deaf. 
I looked around and everyone was looking at me, waiting for my ‚Äúok, ma or yes, ma‚Äù
But I said no. 
The vibe of our table changed. 
My aunt basically ordered me to hand over my room key card, again, I said no. 
She then said it was wrong of me to expect an adult to be sleeping in the same room with their kids when another child has a free room (I‚Äôm 22 but I‚Äôm also the youngest)
Again I said no and asked her to ask someone else. 
At this everyone turned on me asking why I needed a room to myself, asking what I was doing by myself that would make me not want to share with kids. 
It was so uncomfortable I left.
The next, day, we had plans to go to the theme park, but they all left without me. I called my cousins, but they won‚Äôt pick up.
I texted and was left on read.
I called my dad about this and he told me not to worry he‚Äôll handle it.
Dinner that night, I was called a snitch, that I had run to my dad when I was the one being disrespectful. Then my aunty asked me to leave the table or give my ‚Äúelder sister‚Äú my room card. (It was like a go to your room moment), so I went to my room called my dad again and this time he told me to just change rooms to hold the peace.
My mom and brothers said not to, that they were looking for a free babysitter. (her kids aren‚Äôt unruly half the time) but I‚Äôm not here to babysit.
Today, I was left behind again. 
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm really upset about this but I also don‚Äôt want to give in. I‚Äôm thinking to just go home, but it‚Äôs quite expensive to change my ticket.

But when I pointed out she wasn‚Äôt my sister, she got mad and told me to F off. I then proceeded to say she wasn‚Äôt actually a part of this family and that she was acting like an ungrateful brat. She hung up the call and called my mother, who reprimanded me for saying that to her and calling me selfish.

So Reddit, I need to know, AITA for calling her that?

15,1e2micu,AITA for refusing to pay back my mom after I covered most household expenses for years?,"I (34F) have been living together with my mom (58F), a diagnosed narcissist, in a two-bedroom apartment for a few years. I got this apartment to help her out of a homelessness situation, with me paying all initial fees and deposits. We've since both been working and splitting bills and costs about 50/50, but I've been covering all food expenses ($400-$600 monthly) and occasionally other household items. Mom buys toilet paper and cleaning supplies, and we're supposed to split rent, electricity, and WiFi.

Over the past two years, I've spent about $10K on groceries (total for both of us), while mom has contributed only about $600 in the entire 2 years. (Not something we both decided, but I didn't mind at the time and didn't want to harp on her). 

I lost my job a year ago and struggled financially. During this period, I still managed to pay for food, internet, and electricity, plus partial rent by working (under the table) for a family friend on her ranch doing cleaning and other ranch work. Mom helped cover my rent shortfall when I ended up being short on my portion, totaling about $2K over 6-8 months. Even then, I was still spending $1,000+ monthly on household expenses all by myself on the things that were supposed to be split evenly.

Now employed again, I thought we were operating as a team. However, mom claims I owe her $3K, which seems exaggerated and uncalled for given my continuous contributions. I've also been driving her everywhere due to her car breaking down, without even asking for gas money in return.

I explained that if I wasn't solely responsible for all of the food, electric, and internet during my unemployment, I could have afforded my full share of the rent. I calculated that just her half of food costs alone over two years exceed $4K. I told her all this, emphasizing that I would not be paying her back. I suggested we consider it even, given our family situation.

Mom is now furious, giving me nasty looks and not speaking to me. Despite her narcissism, she's generally been loving and supportive, and an overall good mom over the years. I feel conflicted and hurt by her reaction, especially since I believe I've been getting the short end of the stick financially. Originally, I wasn't trying to keep a tally of everything, but it's hard not to add things up as I reflect on everything.

So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to pay her back?

16,1e2mcq3,"AITA For making a scene when my brothers girlfriend tried to ""protect her peace""?","I didn't know how to title the post. I apologise. 

My son is eleven months old and 97th percentile for height. He is a big ass baby (currently 36in tall - or about the size of your average 2.5yo) and in 3T clothing. 

However, despite him being so big, he is still just a baby and most of his nutrition ia still from breastmilk. 

For the 4th we had a big family cookout and my brother invited his girlfriend. I live out of state and I didn't want my flights to be too close together so I'm staying for a bit longer. My brother and his girlfriend are doing the same thing.

My family is aware that my son is a baby, obviously, but my brothers girlfriend was not and was initially very shocked when she saw him ""misbehaving"". We explained that he's still a baby, so he's still just exploring the world.

She remained uncomfortable but we mostly avoid each other. Because he's so big feeding him is a chore so I use an armchair as there isn't enough support elsewhere and so there isn't much I can do about covering up (he gets sweaty under blankets and won't eat).

It's been a tense couple of weeks. Last night I think we both kind of lost it. My son needed feeding and she was in the chair; I asked her to move which she whined about but did get up. Everything was fine for another hour or so until she demanded my brother pay for her to go to a hotel for the remaining nights because she can't cope with me and the baby.

He asked what she meant and she said that he's clearly big enough to be on real food and I enjoy making her uncomfortable by feeding him in front of her. 

I got embarrassingly upset and told her that she should keep her mouth shut because she clearly doesn't know the first thing about parenting and certainly doesn't know anything about me or my son.

We argued the same points for a little more until my son woke from his nap and I left to collect him. She then left after telling us all, loudly, that she needs to ""protect her peace"" (which is honestly not a phrase I thought real people said). 

My brother told me I was being immature and left with her. My dad is on ""my side"" but did tell me I should have removed myself from the situation as I'm a grown woman and she's still a teenager (I'm three years older than her so I think thats BS).

Jack instantly cut off all ties with the entire group, and pretended we were strangers which came as a shock.

The next 8 months (Sep-Apr), Jill could never find time to hangout with the group because of classwork. She said she really wanted to but not a single time did it happen. We kept getting the idea that she doesn‚Äôt want to and we had to accept it, but she said she wanted to but it was always just bad timing. 

In March, she tells me she has been seeing someone since the breakup, and most times when she could not hang out it‚Äôs because she would be with him and his friends. I felt lied to, and told her I would think about how I felt about this, and we later talked it through. I said that I was happy she was happy but felt lied to and she continues to do so with the rest of the group, fearing judgement.

I just had a big argument with my father. I‚Äôm 25, finishing my master's, and will soon start working. Since I don‚Äôt yet make an income, I am financially dependent on him. I‚Äôve stopped talking to my mother because of her manipulative behavior and emotional abuse. I‚Äôve been relying on my father to finance my life in London for the last few months.

I am working hard academically, but he‚Äôs also been working really hard. He bought a new flat where I spent three weeks, had friends over, and then left. My father is kind and giving but bad at expressing his emotions. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know what he wants, and later, he often lashes out because people didn‚Äôt understand him.

This time, I left the apartment to go back to London and didn‚Äôt do a thorough cleaning. I only took the bedsheets off, put them in the washing machine, made sure the kitchen was relatively clean, and that‚Äôs it. It wasn‚Äôt particularly dirty, but it wasn‚Äôt a professional-grade cleaning. Before leaving, his girlfriend told me to get a cleaner, so I did.

We have two apartments; the second one is where I slept the last night because it is closer to the train station. When I left, I was very late for my flight, so I left in a hurry, forgetting to close the windows and turn the AC off. When I got to the airport, I was too late, and my dad had to give me ‚Ç¨300 to pay for my last-minute flight to Paris. I rely too much on his financial help. This has always been the case, and it‚Äôs like a reflex to me.

After this, he came back home to the flat close to the train station and sent me a couple of angry messages saying I was responsible for forgetting to turn off the AC and that it cost money. Then he told me I should‚Äôve cleaned the apartment myself without him asking for a cleaner.

20,1e2lagw,AITA for confronting my brother for losing my gold chain?,"I have a gold chain that was gifted to me by my mom, it was a decent thickness (not too thick, not to thin) Italy Stamped 14K and it was from Greece when she was younger.

I don't have much jewelry pieces, because I normally don't have anything nice, but this was one piece that I had that I absolutely loved and just the look of it overall, and I would wear it on special event occasions, and I took care of it.

My brother for some reason decides to buy a cross on Etsy; which was gold plated, and then decided to take my gold chain and start wearing it. In the shower, gym, work, everywhere.

I would tell him many times I don't feel comfortable with him wearing it, and I would like it back. Which he would get dismissive about, or irritated.

I then took it back one day, and finally decided to wear it, while he whined and begged to wear it, so I let him use it, with him promising he'd put it back.

Now it's been more than 2 weeks, and he casually asks me if I ""have it"" ... I tell him, I do not, and react in an upset manner, saying I hope he hadn't lose it, and I start overthinking and getting anxious.

He throws a temper tantrum with me, for reacting upset and then gives me a ""sorry"" apology text the day after, saying I ""annoyed him"" for merely being upset that he lost my chain, and that I'm being ""materialistic.""

I told him to find it; he looked for it can't find it. So now I think it either got stolen, or he clearly dropped it somewhere.

I'm still upset about it and he gets dismissive saying he would ""buy a new one"" and that ""I don't need one anytime soon"" but I feel frustrated because I can't seem to find a similar design one online, nor the same size. Which is upsetting.

Secondly this isn't the first time he lost something, he has lost his AirPod Pros that were gifted to him, shoes that were gifted to him, etc.

I feel really upset about it, but he could care less.

I don't have much jewelry pieces, because I normally don't have anything nice, but this was one piece that I had that I absolutely loved and just the look of it overall, and I would wear it on special event occasions, and I took care of it.

My brother for some reason decides to buy a cross on Etsy; which was gold plated, and then decided to take my gold chain and start wearing it. In the shower, gym, work, everywhere.

I would tell him many times I don't feel comfortable with him wearing it, and I would like it back. Which he would get dismissive about, or irritated.

I then took it back one day, and finally decided to wear it, while he whined and begged to wear it, so I let him use it, with him promising he'd put it back.

Now it's been more than 2 weeks, and he casually asks me if I ""have it"" ... I tell him, I do not, and react in an upset manner, saying I hope he hadn't lose it, and I start overthinking and getting anxious.

He throws a temper tantrum with me, for reacting upset and then gives me a ""sorry"" apology text the day after, saying I ""annoyed him"" for merely being upset that he lost my chain, and that I'm being ""materialistic.""

I told him to find it; he looked for it can't find it. So now I think it either got stolen, or he clearly dropped it somewhere.

I'm still upset about it and he gets dismissive saying he would ""buy a new one"" and that ""I don't need one anytime soon"" but I feel frustrated because I can't seem to find a similar design one online, nor the same size. Which is upsetting.

Secondly this isn't the first time he lost something, he has lost his AirPod Pros that were gifted to him, shoes that were gifted to him, etc.

I feel really upset about it, but he could care less.

21,1e2l87y,WIBTA for moving across the country and taking my mom with me,"I (26F) live with my mom in Los Angeles, and I don't foresee this living arrangement changing anytime soon. Due to skyrocketing rents and her fixed income post-retirement, she had to move in with me. We have a great relationship, and I've accepted this as our reality.

Responsibility for our household has always fallen on me, despite having an older brother. Our immigrant mom never made more than minimum wage; we grew up low-income and in terrible neighborhoods.

Since age 16, I held part-time jobs to help with rent and bills. Meanwhile, my brother pursued creative work so his income was never reliable and his lifestyle was funded by us. He never held down a job, he lived at home, he constantly ""borrowed"" money, he never paid rent, he never paid bills, he borrowed my mom's car and got it towed or got tickets he never paid, he traveled the world on our dime and never once tried to help the family in any way even when he booked big jobs that paid thousands. My sister, though young, never contributed financially either.

Last year, my brother finally started booking jobs consistently and making decent money. I thought for sure he would step up and help my mom financially. Instead, I watched my brother live his best life and travel the world with his girlfriend. My sister moved in with her boyfriend into a luxury apartment. They essentially abandoned our mom to live better lives with their significant others. Both of them living lives that I never got the chance to live because I was financially supporting everyone. 

Without telling anyone, I applied to out-of-state colleges and secured scholarships and grants as a non-trad freshman. I told my family that I've already accepted my place at a college in the NE and will be moving there in August. I made arrangements to live off-campus knowing that my mom would have to come with me.

Now, my brother and sister are furious, accusing me of selfishness for not consulting them. They claim I can't decide to relocate our mom across the country without their input and that I should've discussed my college plans with them first. They argue I'm jeopardizing their relationship with our mom.

I came home from vacation to find that John Doe, (who just finished his degree) had not resigned his contract with our landlord and was now splitting the X50 with Jane for the largest room. This meant that all of our rates went up by 100 since the landlord thought there was only 5 people in the house. The rest of us are all students still and I don't think it's fair for him to not resign a contract. He told me about it in a joking way saying he was saving money so I would seem like a hard arse to rat on him but I also understand that he is trying to have less expenses.

Anyways, I, (young teenager female) have never liked anyone coming into my room. I one time had a breakdown when I was 5 when my mom, dad, and big brother all came into my room and started talking about stuff that didn't concern me.

So recently we moved houses. My least favorite uncle and his kids who I don't enjoy being around anymore are coming over today. Now I know I'm gonna be forced to hang out with my little cousin, who is younger than me but I don't like being around her because she's boring, bland, and doesn't like doing anything or gives up when learning something. I asked my mom if I have to be around her and she said yes because she doesn't know when I'll see her again. 

Also my family has a habit of deciding to barge into my room, lay down on my bed, then try to take a nap. Now I've found a way to stop my brother, which is to spray any perfumes I have laying around since he hates the smell of anything good and didn't start wearing deodorant until he had a crush on a girl, and my mom, who started coming into my room to make me come out of my room and hand out with my family.

But my dad is a different issue. If I'm sitting at my desk, he'll come in and lay down. Today, I actually cleaned my room, and so he used that as an excuse to lay down on my bed to test how well I made my bed. I didn't say anything, but I did feel uncomfortable and a bit upset because I have expressed to my ENTIRE FAMILY that I don't like people touching me, making animal noises to try to be cute with me, or people coming into my personal space/touching my stuff. The problem is I have Mexican parents, so family is everything to them. 

Right now, I told my dad ""Why is it that everyone likes to come into my room? I've said before I don't like it... so why does everyone do it?"" So he got up and proceeded to guilt trip me about how he would have loved his family to come in and bother him when he was my age because his mom was busy, his dad was already gone, and his siblings were older than him. Is it bad that I don't care? He uses that excuse all the time! He left my room all angry and so that's why I'm making this. 

I can't tell anyone that I don't want them to do something because then I'm ""touchy and dramatic"" but if I do the same thing to them I'm ""disrespectful""! I can't ask for anything without them calling me ungrateful, but if I refuse to do something for them then I'm lazy.

I had finished with the other people and began to do closing paperwork and counting. By the time I had finished it was around 8:15 and she was still working with the other people. 

Now this is were I think me getting mad was justified, in any other situation if was me then I would have been left alone without a second thought, my manager is notorious for leaving whenever he pleases and when he gets stuck working late shifts he complains. Well due to the circumstances with my family I texted my manager if it was ok if I could leave since from what I could tell the phones my co worker was working on were either finished transferring or half way done.

I then get a texted back saying that I had to stay until she had to leave which pissed me off and also pissed off my mom who was waiting in the store along with this family. So I went out to check out the progress of my coworker.

Events abridged:

She had issues with the watches which I went above and beyond to help with IMO

She had to go into the back for 20 minutes for a mistake she made

I swore once due to frustration and a customer yelled at me so I apologized

Didn‚Äôt offer me a ride home after my mom left cause it was taking to long

My coworker is very OCD about things but at the same time is over the top like when me or my other coworker count the change fund early in the night so we aren‚Äôt stuck to late she snitches to our manager about it.

My mom tried to talk to him, while me and my sister were crying trying to calm ourselves down. My dad told my mom that I cussed at him, and then my mom came and told me that I was in the wrong for cursing at him since I'm a child and he‚Äôs an adult, therefore no matter how mad I get I shouldn't raise my voice or curse at him. We tell her what he told us, but she still says that it's not the right way to go at it. They got into an argument that night while I was on the phone with my close friend, and I started crying and had to turn on my fan to try and hide their arguing.

Yesterday he came into my room and threw a giant Slim Jim at me before leaving and today my dad sent me a paragraph apologizing but brings up how we‚Äôre lazy, disrespectful and don‚Äôt listen, to which I responded with, a proper apology and an explanation for it as well, he commonly ‚Äòapologizes‚Äô, he says he understands and will try to, me being skeptical says we‚Äôll see and he thinks in getting attitude, so I send him tone tags, saying that if he needed them I'd start using them to help him, I use them personally because I can't read tone, and he still thought I was getting smart with him.",0.0,0.0024920564610511065,0,1

29,1e2jy9g,AITA for telling my dad I won‚Äôt be funding his retirement?,"So my husband and I recently had a baby. We‚Äôve been together for over 10 years. We have our own apartment, it‚Äôs a little small so we do eventually want to upgrade. My dad lives alone in a 3 bedroom house which is fully paid off. He‚Äôs semi retired, retired early and has a really good pension but still works part time. 

He‚Äôs also a narcissistic functioning alcoholic. I have had a long history of issues with him and if it wasn‚Äôt for wanting a nicer place for the baby I wouldn‚Äôt even be considering this. He would love nothing more than to spend his days drinking and watching Netflix, but he has to work a bit still because his pension doesn‚Äôt cover all his bills. Just two months ago he was in the ICU for alcohol poisoning. 

Anyway, when my baby was born he offered to let us move in so we would have more room and be able to have more money for the baby. He said we would take the top floor and he would have the basement (with a kitchenette and bathroom). He said all he would want from us is to pay the utilities. 

I THOUGHT this was a way of him reaching out for help. If we live there then he would be able to see us and his grandbaby more often and maybe he wouldn‚Äôt be so lonely and drink so much. Well fast forward to now, we discussed it more in depth and he wants to do $30k worth of renos to the basement before we move in, which he wants us to pay for in monthly payments once we move in which‚Ä¶ ok fine fair enough. THEN he says he wants to stop working once we move in and in 2 or 3 years he ‚Äòmay‚Äô decide he wants to ‚Äòdo something with his life‚Äô like travel the world and take out $30-$40k against the house to do so, at which point he would ‚Äòhave to‚Äô start charging us rent (amount unknown) to pay for that loan‚Ä¶ 

Am I nuts or does it sound like he wants us to fund his retirement and drinking? The whole point of us moving in was we would save money, now we‚Äôre basically going to be back to paying what we are in rent now, stuck in a house that we have no equity in which he could literally sell at any point.

I basically told him off because this is NOT how he first offered it to us, and he got pissed off and started screaming at me like he has since I was a kid. As if he offered us this great thing and we just pissed on it. I mean, if i was in his position and my kid was in my position with rent/house prices the way they are I wouldn‚Äôt be charging them rent on top of utilities, the house is paid for!

He also said that if she isn't coming neither is he. And if she did join us then Wendy wouldn't go. It would just be too awkward. It's too fresh of a breakup. When we told Wendy about him asking if his girlfriend can join us and how we felt about the situation and his pushback about it, she broke down crying and calling him a jerk. Which we agree. It seems he has no emotional awareness of others nor the ability to understand how his actions affect others. 
His girlfriend, even knowing that he and Wendy were recently dating, said she still wanted to go.
He has made this a bigger deal than it really should be and yet he doesn't think it is a big deal if Cassie comes. We still have to lay down the rules and tell him she can't go but we just want to make sure we aren't the jerks in this situation.

32,1e2jsys,AITA for laughing in my sisters face?,"So today, it was my grandmas 90th birthday party. My entire family came, alongside my sister‚Äôs bf who we‚Äôll call A (18F/18M). I should acknowledge the fact me (19F) and my sister have had a rocky relationship and I cut her out for a few years when she moved in with my dad (I also don‚Äôt have a relationship with). However, over the past few months (her bf and mine has been encouraging us to have one)we‚Äôve been speaking and creating a relationship. 

For context, the reason we stopped speaking was because for 5 years she was the ‚Äúproblem child‚Äù, causing issues within the family and outside, having the police called on her, running away multiple times etc. My family has 7 children and she‚Äôs the only one that has created these sorts of problems so it isn‚Äôt a parenting issue. She would blame me for everything saying that I‚Äôm absolutely horrible to her (definitely was at some points, although I think it was in retaliation and not unjustified) and that I‚Äôm the reason she acts out. 

Now back to today, me and her bf A are the only ones in the family that smoke bar my uncle, so we were all outside together. Well my sister joined us sometimes, and we were chatting away. I would say I have a decent relationship with A and it‚Äôs small talk while we have a smoke so I see no big deal. Well one time it was just me and A outside and my sister comes storming out shouting at me to stay away from her bf because I‚Äôm a slutty whore (bare in mind I‚Äôm in a LTR, that I have never cheated in. He wasn‚Äôt there was because he‚Äôs on holiday with his family currently). I started laughing because I was mainly shocked and confused and A was trying to calm her down.

I walked back inside saying wtf is wrong with you we were literally talking about you and went to my grandad and his wife. She followed inside still shouting saying I need to stay away from A and out of her life while everyone stood around shocked while I was laughing, again out of nervousness. Eventually my stepdad was able to get her to leave the event hall and go talk down but it put a huge damper on the party and I apologised profusely to my grandma as she‚Äôs literally 90 and this was meant to be her day. 

When I got home, I had my stepdad and mum saying that while what she did was wrong I shouldn‚Äôt have laughed at her because it made her feel even worse. I bit my tongue but it carried on saying how I was in the wrong and I ended up saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my fault that she‚Äôs a jealous cow, I literally have my OWN bf that I‚Äôm VERY HAPPY WITH. There‚Äôs a reason I cut her out of my life but none of you guys were happy about that because it made it awkward for you!

34,1e2jrat,AITA for spending less than my dance partner for prom?,"So to start with I would like to explain what I mean by that. I (16f) am finishing secondary school in two weeks and on my last day we have prom in the evening. Since it would be a waste if nobody could dance the waltz, we were required to join a week long dance class (it costed 44‚Ç¨ or $47). There you had to choose your own partner and you had to register yourself and your partner for prom. 

At the end the instructor told us that the partner with the male role has to buy a bouquet for the other to hold while dancing. And I‚Äòm not sure but I think he also said that the woman role should also buy a gift in return. 

Now then we arrive at the problem: Today my partner texted me (we exchanged numbers during the courses) and said he ordered the bouquet which surprised me since we still have two weeks but he seems like the type to always do things early. More surprising - the bouquet is around 30‚Ç¨. I know that‚Äôs pretty standard but I expected students like us to buy those flowers cheap at the grocery store and was not the least bit bothered by that. He also sent me a link to a card game that costs a bit less (shipping included) than the flowers he bought me. That is the gift he wanted in return.

It‚Äôs nice that he didn‚Äôt expect me to guess what he wants but - and this is my biggest issue - he ordered those flowers without us agreeing on a price limit. I don‚Äôt want a 30‚Ç¨ bouquet that I‚Äòll hold for 40 minutes between our sweaty palms. I also don‚Äôt want to gift someone I barely know a card game that‚Äôs around the same price. I know I sound stingy but the expenses for the whole prom add up (dress, shoes, hair, entry tickets, dance lessons) and this seems like a waste.

I proceeded to ask him if it would be possible to buy a cheaper bouquet, make the limit 10‚Ç¨ or higher, I would have accepted that. He said he would buy the bouquet regardless but that I could buy him something worth 10‚Ç¨. But now I feel guilty that I will spend way less money on the gift than him. Should I just accept it as an additional expense typical for prom and buy him that card game or is it okay for me to spend less than him?

You‚Äòll probably notice grammatical mistakes because my English level isn‚Äôt high yet. I hope it was readable.

I don‚Äôt want a 30‚Ç¨ bouquet that I‚Äòll hold for 40 minutes between our sweaty palms. I also don‚Äôt want to gift someone I barely know a card game that‚Äôs around the same price. I know I sound stingy but the expenses for the whole prom add up (dress, shoes, hair, entry tickets, dance lessons) and this seems like a waste.

I proceeded to ask him if it would be possible to buy a cheaper bouquet, make the limit 10‚Ç¨ or higher, I would have accepted that. He said he would buy the bouquet regardless but that I could buy him something worth 10‚Ç¨. But now I feel guilty that I will spend way less money on the gift than him. Should I just accept it as an additional expense typical for prom and buy him that card game or is it okay for me to spend less than him?

You‚Äòll probably notice grammatical mistakes because my English level isn‚Äôt high yet. I hope it was readable.

TLDR.: My partner to prom is spending way more money on the gift than I am. AITA if I don‚Äòt buy something of equal value?",0.0,1.045398473739624,1,0
35,1e2jnuk,"AITA for telling my friend that he sounds obsessive, and it‚Äôs starting to get weird.","Last night me (19m) and three other friends (all 19M) were playing PS5 like every other night and as it gets later of course we start to joke around more. But now for the past few months one of my friends, I‚Äôll call Frank in this post, has started to keep mentioning a person from a situation that happened way back in April, and especially in recent weeks its just started to get boring and in my opinion a bit weird. 

Last year was our first year of University, and Frank liked a girl I‚Äôll call Dawn, for quite a few months. She wasn‚Äôt interested, and made clear to him that she just wanted to be friends. She told him that in March. Around that time one of Dawn‚Äôs friends must have told Frank that Dawn had a massive crush on a guy, but none of them really knew him. However, I knew him from the first half of the year where we were in the same seminars, I‚Äôll call him Tyler in this post. Tyler was a chill guy we got along well but we didn‚Äôt really form a close friendship or anything. This annoyed Frank a lot and when I told Frank I knew Tyler he started asking loads of questions, where he wanted to know everything about him, but I didn‚Äôt even entertain it and made out I knew barely anything because I thought it was just phase. 

Over the next weeks Dawn must‚Äôve finally approached Tyler as they were seen sitting together. This pissed Frank off a lot,  I don‚Äôt even think they were dating or anything, they‚Äôd literally just started to speak to each other. Frank started to do silly things, like just stare at him for like 5 mins. But then he started to take it a bit too far, he started doing things like brushing shoulders on purpose, stepping on his bag if he left it on the floor or deliberately sit behind him to kick his seat. Tyler started to notice as one of Dawn‚Äôs friends asked Frank if something was up, but he said nothing was. Frank did it again before a lecture, (should add Frank literally started coming before lecturers started just so he could do shit like this) he nudged Tyler in the back again while he was speaking to someone. But this time he was holding a drink and it spilt all over the girl he was next to. This annoyed him and he said to Frank wtf is your problem. Frank is a hothead so got heated. I tried defusing it but Frank got more and more riled up and Tyler humbled him, Tyler had been training Muay Thai and MMA since he was like 15 on top of that the dude clearly worked out. 

This brings us to now, last night Frank once again brought up the situation and went off on a rant, I first asked him if he‚Äôs alright. He then asked what‚Äôs wrong with what he‚Äôs saying and that its just a joke, and I told him he just sounds a bit obsessive and weird talking about a guy this much. He got mad called all 3 of us snakes and left, and he hasn‚Äôt been responding to us since.  We all agree that it‚Äôs starting to get unhealthy and that he‚Äôs starting to sound almost delusional.

36,1e2jlaq,AITA for continuing to get high around my boyfriend when he doesn‚Äôt like it?,"So my boyfriend and I haven‚Äôt been dating for too incredibly long, but a month or so ago he brought up to me that he doesn‚Äôt like (and feels uncomfortable) being around me when I‚Äôm high. I use it for mostly pretty medical reasons, I‚Äôm never dumb with it and I use it to fall asleep or to prevent panic attacks which is something I am VERY prone to. When he brought this up to me, I initially stopped smoking around him and stopped being high around him. This was decently hard for me since you could say that I have a reliance to using it to be able to sleep but alas, I persevered because I love him.

A few weeks later I decided to get high but I only did it right before bed, so that he didn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable with me experiencing it around him. Anyways, when I was already high, I was curious and asked him why he was uncomfortable with it and why he didn‚Äôt like me doing it around him. He proceeded to tell me that it was because he didn‚Äôt like ‚Äúwho I was‚Äù when I was high and explained me to be ‚Äúrigid‚Äù and ‚Äútoo easygoing‚Äù Truthfully this shocked me so heavily and I had nothing to say to it so I just said okay let‚Äôs go to bed.

After this instance, I decided that I would get high when I wanted to and when I needed it. I cut down a little bit for his sake, but I didn‚Äôt try nearly as hard to completely be rid of it because I felt like the explanation he had for why he wanted me to stop was more insulting than helpful. AITA for continuing to get high around him when I know he doesn‚Äôt like who I am?

+ I also talked to him about how that statement was unfair to use against me in terms of not getting high, and that I felt it was a bit controlling, and he took it well and said that it‚Äôs fine to do now, but he‚Äôs still uncomfortable with me doing it.

This was all booked about 6 months before the festival so we could lock in good rates. Important note: the hotel rooms were non refundable!

About a month before the festival one of my friends Kat got cast in a play. Because of this she decided she couldn‚Äôt go to the festival anymore. The festival was two weeks before opening night so she would‚Äôve only missed rehearsals not any performances. Important note: when casting they give you a conflict sheet to write potential conflicts and she did not write down the festival.

Anyway, because Kat was no longer going she requested that me and my other friend Taylor pay for the entire hotel room. Kat‚Äôs argument was she wasn‚Äôt using it anyway. Why would she pay for something she‚Äôs not using? 

Taylor and I felt like she should still pay for her portion of the room because why were we being punished for Kat‚Äôs decision to change plans. And if we had known we might have had the entire friend group split 1 hotel room (which we had done in the past when it was only 5 of us). 

Kat was super upset with Taylor and I for this but ended up paying her share. We remained friends and I thought we had moved past it. However, she brought it up just the other day about how that was a shitty thing for us to do. So now I don‚Äôt know what to think.

38,1e2it9r,"AITA for not telling my wife prior to lunch with family, that I was paying?","My wife and I, along with my mother and aunt went out to lunch today.  The previous day, my wife and I had agreed we would try to pay for our own share of the bill rather than having my mother or aunt get it.  Last night, around 11pm, after my wife had gone to sleep, I had a conversation with my mother that I would just grab the check rather than mess around and fight over the bill.  I did forget to mention this to my wife (I work overnights and had just started my shift, and by the end I had forgotten).  So anyway, at lunch today when the check came, they asked if we wanted separate checks or all on one?  I responded, all on one is fine, then my wife said she had thought we were getting our own.  I said we could just get it.  This maybe happened over 2 or 3 seconds and I didn't think much of it.

After lunch she was mad because I put her in a position where she said she came off very inconsiderate with her comment about getting our own checks (and thus, others would be paying their own).  I assured her no one thought that and it was not a big deal, but was still angry that I had put her in the position and she would have never said anything if I had told her prior to lunch.  I apologized for not letting her know in advance, as I never want to hurt my wife's feelings, but I maintained it wasn't a big deal, no one thought that she was being inconsiderate at all.  

It's not about the money at all, everyone at the table could easily afford treating everyone else, she is mad about the position I put her in.  I really don't think this is a big deal, the whole interaction was 3 seconds tops, and no one thought anything of it.

I have made a friend (24M) in my 8am class who likes to study in the library after the class is over (around noon). We usually eat lunch and then study together in the library until it's time for me to go to my next class at 17:30. He usually goes home at this time or to a cafe to continue studying. (We both live at home with our families, and his home is pretty loud/chaotic so it's better for him to study outside of home)

I use this time in between to study/do homeworks for both classes, but¬† sometimes it's a lot to be studying together for 4-5 hours straight 4 times a week. Sometimes I just want to sit in my car scroll on social media for 15 minutes or just do some meditation or crossword puzzles to take a break and not have to socialize or answer questions about my life etc. Sometimes over the weekend, we'll do homework together at nearby library for a few hours too.

I was the youngest by like 15 years so there was a lot of anger from my ""siblings"" about taking their parents empty nest away. I never asked to be adopted into this family and was like 3 when I went to live with them so it's not like I had a lot of choices in what they did. 
     After all my siblings moved out and we moved closer to the grandparents my adopted father did somethings to me (iykyk) I was moved out of the house for about a year. Was brought back against my request and had to finish up my childhood with them. 
    I went to college as soon as I could even though I wasn't ready. Tried to stay close to my ""family"" but when I got a job and stopped going to church as much they dropped me. 
      I married a guy a few years back. They hate him because he isn't in their religion and doesn't really care if he hurts their feelings protecting me. We have a son. The last few years our audhd child hasn't done actually birthday parties and we have always tried to include the family that wanted to be included but this year they decided to just send money and tell him to have fun. Like not a single family member showed up for my son. (Thanks to some amazing friends he didn't really notice). 

    Here comes the WIBTA bit my sister that lives in a different country messaged me last night and said hey I know it's super last minute but can you drive like 3 hours to mom and dads anniversary get together but no your husband can't come but please bring your child. In words that actually humans say to not make it look bad.

Thanks.",Not the A-hole,2024-07-13,"WIBTA If I didn't go see my sister?  I was adopted by my aunt and her family 22 years ago.  I was the youngest by like 15 years so there was a lot of anger from my ""siblings"" about taking their parents empty nest away. I never asked to be adopted into this family and was like 3 when I went to live with them so it's not like I had a lot of choices in what they did. 
     After all my siblings moved out and we moved closer to the grandparents my adopted father did somethings to me (iykyk) I was moved out of the house for about a year. Was brought back against my request and had to finish up my childhood with them. 
    I went to college as soon as I could even though I wasn't ready. Tried to stay close to my ""family"" but when I got a job and stopped going to church as much they dropped me. 
      I married a guy a few years back. They hate him because he isn't in their religion and doesn't really care if he hurts their feelings protecting me. We have a son. The last few years our audhd child hasn't done actually birthday parties and we have always tried to include the family that wanted to be included but this year they decided to just send money and tell him to have fun. Like not a single family member showed up for my son. (Thanks to some amazing friends he didn't really notice). 

    Here comes the WIBTA bit my sister that lives in a different country messaged me last night and said hey I know it's super last minute but can you drive like 3 hours to mom and dads anniversary get together but no your husband can't come but please bring your child.

Despite this, my aunt (my mom‚Äôs only sister) continues to invite my dad to family events. I have largely excused it because they are usually large groups. My mom and I expressed how it was hurtful that her only sibling and my only aunt on that side would invite him to events (she had significant knowledge about his abuse). 

Yesterday, I found out my dad was invited to my cousin‚Äôs wedding‚Äîa small ceremony of only about 25 people. It boggled my mind that he would be invited‚Äîmy dad isn‚Äôt even that close to my cousin! 

I expressed my concerns to my aunt and she initially apologized, but provided a lengthy explanation about how this was hard for her and her kids. I responded that it is much harder for those of us who have to be in intimate family settings with someone who abused us and our mom. She continues to insist that it is my cousin‚Äôs day and that he controls the invites and that his wedding day his about him and his wife to be‚Äînot me. 

I let her know that I am not attending the wedding because they have been so disrespectful nd she is absolutely infuriated. She has told everyone who will listen that I am putting her and her family in an impossible situation and making the day about me. 

I may be the AH for not supporting my cousin and his feelings, it is his day after all. I also get that divorce can have significant ramifications and they are navigating the complexity of it all as well. 

 I also feel like my aunt and cousin are acting like the AH because they are completely disregarding the feelings of their actual family members.

46,1e2h3kb,AITA for telling my boyfriend he‚Äôs being selfish about hearing aids?,"I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a year. He uses hearing aids and can communicate orally. He always wanted me to learn ASL and I promised I would eventually. 

About three months ago, we decided to move in together and I started taking ASL lessons. He warned me that he usually doesn‚Äôt wear his HAs at home so communication might be harder, but promised to make adjustments until I get better at signing.

A month ago, we finally moved in together. Unfortunately things were harder than I imagined it would be.  When he said he doesn‚Äôt usually wear them at home, I assumed he would take them off before going to bed or so.  But he takes them off as soon as he‚Äôs back from work.

You can see where this is going. Because my ASL isn‚Äôt there yet I have to constantly write things down, and let me tell you it is not fun. It doesn‚Äôt feel like actual communication. He doesn‚Äôt like it either, he says I should always attempt to sign first, look it up if I have to, and writing down should be my last choice. This strict teacher attitude also drives me nuts.

Yesterday I was telling him something via signing then realized I couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt feel like writing either so I told him to forget about it. He got upset at me for giving up and told me to at the least write it down. 

I was put off by his demanding attitude, I wrote, ‚Äúmaybe if you wore your fucking hearing aids, this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.‚Äù He put them on and we started arguing. He said I knew what I was getting myself into, he warned me about it. 

I said yes but he didn‚Äôt tell me he throws them away as soon as he‚Äôs home. He said I‚Äôm exaggerating and asked me what I expected anyway. I told him I expected him to make some adjustments like he promised . He said he already does, ‚Äúwe write things all the time.‚Äù 

I told him that‚Äôs not an adjustment for me but for him . He said ‚Äúsorry for being deaf my bad‚Äù I told him not to turn this into something it‚Äôs not. He can perfectly hear when he puts his HAs on. He chooses not to and makes this harder than it supposed to be. He can wear them at home a little more than he normally used to until I get better at signing. That‚Äôs such a simple solution, and he‚Äôs making this harder for both of us.

He asked me if I had ever thought they might be uncomfortable for him. I finally snapped and told him ‚Äúand this is uncomfortable for me, he doesn‚Äôt have to be so selfish all the time‚Äù. 

He went, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being selfish?‚Äù I told him yes, he‚Äôs being extremely selfish about this and I can‚Äôt believe how he doesn‚Äôt realize it. He said no, he can‚Äôt believe how I don‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm acting like a total bigot.

Marriage was the next step. None of our families is any way of conservative or religious... So we thought so far...

Story as follows: Planned to do it the old school way in next year. ""official part"" as registry office, change of names, putting on the rings in combination with church part on the same day. We thought how to have a more relaxed day AS WE already experienced a lot of weddings (mid thirties). It always felt the ""best day"" was also the ""most stressed day"" for the married couple. 

Therefore to smoothen it a but we played with the thought of just the two of us doing the official Part and having the party for all friends and family still next year. Unfortunately was no option due to specific papers required for my girlfriend (parents immigrated and she was born in another country.


For whatever reason the governmental process was much easier and quicker than we thought. So we just for curious reasons checked our wish-to-have-date and.. it was still free. 
We booked it.

Now all this was done in secret. Got the rings and we were ready.
On wedding day we brought our two kids to kindergarden, she went to Hair salon, I picked up some flowers, got dressed and after 30 minutes at the registry office we were married. The person at the office took our pictures. Afterwards we went to have an awesome lunch at a fine restaurant and took more pictures. The day was perfect. It truely was ""our day"" and not done for anybody else 

In the evening we picked up our kids from my brother and his wife and showed up in our outfits. They were suprised but totally happy for us. Same as all other people we meet later, even older than us.

After getting the Kids and First gratulation wishes we went to my parents and rang at the door. They opened, saw us in our outfits and asked to which wedding we went. We replied with ""our own"" and the further reaction was a catastrophe. They simply didn't understand why we did it alone, they felt mistreaded by being excluded. We expected them to feel a bit down but still be happy for us. Opposite was the case.
After 1 week they came back from vacation and the reaction is still the same and really conservative, disappointed and not understanding us at all.

The reaction from her parents was really great on the contrary. They felt really happy for us.

We‚Äôre taking two different cars because my sister and I will be staying for three days to see family while my father is staying longer. The trip is mostly to celebrate my sisters and grandfathers (76m) birthday. They share the same birthday and every year they take a photo together. A month ago my sister and I made the plans to go see family and friends for a couple of days and at the time it seemed like a great idea. My sister still has friends in Jersey that she talks to and has made plans with them. I on the other hand don‚Äôt. 

my sister has all these plans to hang out with family and friends while I don‚Äôt have anything to do. I don‚Äôt want to tag along with her and her friends (even though some of them are also my friends) because I feel like that‚Äôs will be awkward. I‚Äôve tried reaching out to some old friends to catch up and hang but no luck. What is really bothering me about the trip is my ex. When I was with my ex she would always talk about getting back at her ex and what she would do to him if she had the chance. Since my ex and I had a pretty nasty break up I‚Äôm worried if her or her brothers find out I‚Äôm back in town they‚Äôll try to pull something.

On top of this there‚Äôs a chance my sister would not want to go entirely if I don‚Äôt go since her and I are really close and she would probably be deterred from going.

 My sister lives in my hometown not too far from my mom. We don‚Äôt have a close relationship. She talks non-stop and only about herself. If you get a word in, she interrupts to bring the conversation back to her. She will talk at you for hours and hours. Also, she is very volatile and harbors a lot of anger towards me and the family. You never know when she will suddenly get super angry. We‚Äôve had long conversations in the past where she has spent hours detailing every way I‚Äôve hurt her and I‚Äôve apologized and told her to be close‚ÄîI need to feel like our relationship goes both ways. Nothing changes and I stopped being alone with her as it would always end with her emotionally dumping on me. 

When I go to visit my Mom, my sister gets angry if I go a day without seeing her or making plans. I don‚Äôt particularly want to visit my sister and I want to avoid confrontation‚Äîso I do an obligatory couple of hours with her and then make up excuses. For example, I‚Äôll say I need to go to bed early. I know that telling her how I really feel is the nicer thing to do, but I feel like the conversation would be hours and hours of every grievance and I wouldn‚Äôt be heard.

It is like every small slight is remembered and cataloged, but every kindness immediately forgotten. I spent years trying to be extra nice to her so she wouldn‚Äôt be so angry at me‚Äîstarting when we were young (I‚Äôm 7 years younger) all the way until I got married. She couldn‚Äôt afford to come to the wedding, so my fiance and I paid thousands to fly her and her family out. At the wedding she was either effusive/clingy the whole wedding (even though we aren‚Äôt close) or she was angry and sulking. She got really mad at me at the wedding for forgetting to hug her even though I had just hugged my brother. Now when the wedding comes up, she gets so angry because she feels like she was slighted and she is still mad at me. After that‚ÄîI said no more trying to make her happy.

53,1e2fu43,AITA for Prioritizing My Career Over Attending My Step-Brother's Wedding?,"Throwaway, don't like mixing things.

I (24M) recently had a conversation with my dad, and I explained that I likely won't be able to attend my stepbrother's (26M) wedding. I'm currently transitioning out of the army and have been offered an opportunity‚Äîan internship perfectly aligned with my career goals. This internship-to-hire promises industry certifications at no cost and provides an enter-level wage of $35/hr, well above the regional average. With certifications tailored for veterans and supported by my transferable experience, there's potential for significant salary negotiation. This opportunity is especially crucial as my wife is currently in nursing school, which will continue for the next two years.

The conflict arose because the wedding dates coincide with my internship's training schedule. When I explained this to my dad, he insisted that attending the wedding was non-negotiable, emphasizing the importance of family above all else. While I deeply respect his perspective, I noted that I live far from the rest of my family (15 hours) and lack a support system. I need to secure a stable job and build a future for my wife and myself, particularly now that I am the sole earner.

Despite clarifying the legal obligations (the internship is my ""place of duty,"" and attendance is mandatory according to military regulations), my dad suggested I find a way to attend the wedding, even proposing I request leave from my superiors. However, this may not be feasible due to the structured nature of the internship program. Unlike my siblings, I live independently and manage all my expenses, making decisions that significantly impact our future.

I firmly believe that my dad would understand the importance of this opportunity if he knew the specifics. Unfortunately, my dad sees my absence as a failure to prioritize family over career ambitions.

While family is very important to me, I am the sole provider in our household, and I firmly believe my wife's needs must take priority. Securing a stable career and financial stability is crucial not only for my personal fulfillment but also for our shared future. I can see why I would be the asshole, placing my career over a wedding, but am I wrong to prioritize these responsibilities over attending my stepbrother's wedding?

Minor edit: I meant to say that I'm sure that my dad would understand the importance. As for my stepbrother, he simply said, ""If anything, you can cancel the internship.""

Mom hadn't told me any specific chores I had to do, but I still cleaned the house, which is a fairly large one and takes around an hour to properly  clean, also completely washed the front of the house, washed my clothes, did the dishes, etc.

After completing all my work I had gone to meet mom at the hospital and tell her about my results personally. When I got back home, dad had bought a pizza and food for himself.

I have been with my partner for 8 years and his sister had a baby born on the same day as me. For the babies first birthday, we attended the birthday party as it was made known the first one is special and they would be upset if we didn‚Äôt make it- this put a wedge in the long weekend get away.

After the first one I proposed to my partner we switch years of going away one year, then going to his nieces birthday the next- this was turned down as he got pressure from his family that it was not ok to miss the birthday party of his neice. 

Next I suggested we go give our gifts and say happy birthday before we go away for the long weekend, or after we get home. Although we won‚Äôt make the birthday party itself- we could have our own celebration. The parties were always busy and we didn‚Äôt get to spend much time with the birthday girl anyway so I thought this was a good compromise as well as it was 1:1 time and still making that effort. This also got turned down as his sister didn‚Äôt appreciate him missing the party. 

Now every year he stays back, attends the birthday of his neice- THEN makes the trip out to meet me and spend the evening and rest of the weekend with me. He usually arrives at 6pm.

61,1e2csp3,AITA For screaming at my dad over ‚Äònothing‚Äô,"To start, I want to say I‚Äôm autistic. This doesn‚Äôt excuse my actions; I was over dramatic. I can recognize that. It was just something that I wanted to make known. I have a difficult time regulating my emotions, but growing up in an environment where I was constantly playing stupid games with friends & getting roughed up, I disciplined myself to not show much in public so I wouldn‚Äôt get clowned on. (I know it sounds corny, but it's true. Bear with me, please.) This means that at home, I CAN be pretty sensitive. I have a sense of humor; I shoot off jokes with my parents all the time, we roast each other & have a great time.

This aside, I need to know if I'm wrong in this situation, or if we all suck.

Last night, I said I wanted to start doing extra things for our dog's health. Fido is in his double digits, and I want to keep him thriving. My dad said it wasn‚Äôt necessary, even though I‚Äôd do the work and pay for everything. My mom agreed with me, and my dad got defensive. He kept unpausing a movie while I was talking to my mom after we asked him to stop multiple times. I closed the tab, and it opened to a funny window. Mom and I laughed, and he blew up, saying he takes care of the dog more and that I only love him ‚Äòabstractly.‚Äô It‚Äôs true he walks the dog more, but he works from home while I go to academic help, play sports, write, study, and go to the gym.

I still feed, play with & groom the dog. I don't shirk responsibilities for him. My dad says  I'm lazy & I never do anything to help out with Fido, even though that‚Äôs not true. We went back & forth. Eventually, I said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting older, & I want to take more responsibility for his health.‚Äù & he responds with ‚ÄúYeah he‚Äôs getting older, & I wish he was older at this point.‚Äù This shocked me because we both love Fido dearly.

This dog saved my life when I was depressed in middle school and had a joint issue that needed surgery. His happiness gave me a reason to live. My dad‚Äôs comment crushed me.

Timeline

*blank* and *blank* county had a tornado 20-30 miles away from us touch down, heading straight north, and we are northeast of there. The only situation that could‚Äôve possibly put us in danger was if the tornado changed direction directly towards us, went 30 miles, and all devices in the house with an emergency weather alarm didn‚Äôt work. At this point, where we live is still not even under watch. I say to my mother, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving the house in this much (physical)pain if we‚Äôre not even under a watch yet.‚Äù My mom says, ‚Äúfine, we‚Äôll all stay here no matter what, and if something happens to your sister, it‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù I jumped ALL over her ass for that, because she herself at one was considering unbreathing her ex husband for using my sister as a weapon. I go away for 10 minutes to cool down so we can talk like adults, and when I come back with a calm tone, she immediately opens up with a snappy quip, though I forgot what. I told her ‚ÄúIm not here to argue, I just want to discuss a game plan with you. I‚Äôm not refusing to leave the house period, but I‚Äôm not rushing to a storm shelter while there‚Äôs no immediate threat, or even a watch, especially with how much (physical)pain I‚Äôm in‚Äù. I told her my radar will give us 10x the head start we would need due to us being literally a mile from the shelter. This parts blurry to think about, but it escalated into another argument, so I walked out of the room to the living room. My sister, 10, talked to me and calmly and respectfully agreed with me, in fact she even whispered it with no intent of our mother hearing it. Unfortunately she wasn‚Äôt quiet enough, and my mother yells from her room ‚Äújust go the fuck to bed‚Äù to her. I told my sister right then and there that she is fine, and free to go do what she wants while I deal with our mother. My mother‚Äôs barely responding at this point due to alcohol and funny gummies(that or muscle relaxers), so we got nowhere with that. I go back to my sister, and said if she wants to talk, I‚Äôm completely free, and so we did. We talked a bit about our mother‚Äôs alcohol addiction, and that she‚Äôs a good person fighting demons, and that goes on for 30 minutes or so. We wrap the conversation up, and perfect timing, we‚Äôre now under tornado watch. I go to my mother‚Äôs room to let her know that now‚Äôs the time to keep your eyes peeled and be ready to go, but now she‚Äôs so unbelievably drunk and high that I had to push her with almost all my strength to get a drunken mumble out of her. Well over half the bottle she had gotten a few hours ago was gone. I could not get her up. I knew at that moment I had to get out of that house. I waited for the storm to pass(no tornado came), spent some time with my sister, packed my essentials and left at 11:00 that night.  




This is the conversation we had the next day:


Me: ‚ÄúFor what it's worth mom, I still love you and always will, the same way i have my entire life, I have no negative feelings for you and think you're a great person going through bad things. But I'm 18 now, and I have the chance to move to a healthier environment, one that has someone that can be there for me at all times, a household that always wants better for themselves. I lived with you through my childhood because I could depend on my mom, but i don't feel the same way anymore. I know you do your best and I will always love you for it, it's admirable. But sometimes the best you can do doesn't always result in the best ending. I need away from everything. I need away from you working yourself to death for no money and drinking and getting high into oblivion when you're home. I need away from a household that can start an argument involving using a child as a weapon over the weather. I need away from a household with people that don‚Äôt want any better for themselves, and away from a household with no priorities. Last night, when we were finally under tornado watch, I couldn't wake you. I shook you as hard as I could and got a drunken mumble out of you. You chose to take a muscle relaxer and drink (over) half a bottle of fireball instead of dealing with your emotions and the issue at hand. If the tornado actually did come, l would have had to drive *sister* to the shelter and leave you. Reasons like that is why I feel like I can't stay anymore. I want you as an active part of my life, but living with you isn't healthy for me anymore. I can't sit there and watch you kill yourself. You just got released from the hospital from a most likely alcohol induced ulcer, and you're already back to a bottle a day. I can't watch you kill yourself mom. I love you, forever.‚Äù

Mother: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by "" By the time we got a watch..."" We were under a WARNING already! And I'm sorry to disagree with you on the rest of this too, but I do. And it doesn't matter what I do, your mind is already made up. Just let me know what you'd like me to do with the house.(the house is mine, OP‚Äôs) Also, whatever your costs are there(where I‚Äôm staying), lemme know. I don't know if I can cover everything, but I can help.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWe never got past tornado watch, and either way you was too fucked up to save your kids if something happened.‚Äù

Mother: ‚ÄúFirst of all, I didn't have a half until AFTER you and I talked... thats what I had left the next day... right at half.... It takes 5 shots within a given hour not to DRIVE. I had 8 in 3 hours.(OP note, I don‚Äôt get what she‚Äôs saying here exactly)My problem was the tornado ON THE GROUND. Not any later ones we may have had watches over. if we aren't going for the real thing, why worry about watches?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúMe and *sister* seen the bottle(OP note, she had only bought that bottle a few hours ago, 2-3 tops. It was almost 2/3 gone). And that ""talk"" was me letting you know that l'd tell you if or when we should go to the shelter based on my radar. Why are you defending yourself being too nessed up to exist, better yet why is an inconvenient argument an excuse for you to get messed up that? You don't want help because you see no problem, and that hurts.‚Äù

Me: You hurt, you work, I can't ask of you to not drink. But you go ballistic on the bottle every time, without fail, then even order more frequently and if you're feeling frisky you'll mix it with muscle relaxers and gummies. l've seen a handle gone in less than 36 hours. I have to walk you to your room multiple times a week. You grounded your daughter to sleep at 3 pm because she respectfully agreed with me instead of you in the other room. You told your son if something happens to his sister, it's his fault. And even when you don't drink, I'm 18 now. I need more from my life than being a housewife(OP note, her doing something as simple as the dishes twice a month is unheard of for her) and enabling you to never find *sister* someone to properly raise her. And if the tornado was such a threat, why'd you black yourself out?‚Äù

Mother: ‚ÄúIt absolutely blows my mind that you're STILL thinking that nothing happened. Not sure where your facts are coming from, but l'd rather not discuss things, when our sources don't say the same things... just going to lead to arguing... not helpful‚Äù

",TL;DR,2024-07-13,"AITA for moving out? AITA? (18M)This is kinda of gonna be two parts in one post. I‚Äôll explain the timeline of events, then a direct transcription of our messages the next day. Sorry, this one‚Äôs really, really long.

Timeline

*blank* and *blank* county had a tornado 20-30 miles away from us touch down, heading straight north, and we are northeast of there. The only situation that could‚Äôve possibly put us in danger was if the tornado changed direction directly towards us, went 30 miles, and all devices in the house with an emergency weather alarm didn‚Äôt work. At this point, where we live is still not even under watch. I say to my mother, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving the house in this much (physical)pain if we‚Äôre not even under a watch yet.‚Äù My mom says, ‚Äúfine, we‚Äôll all stay here no matter what, and if something happens to your sister, it‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù I jumped ALL over her ass for that, because she herself at one was considering unbreathing her ex husband for using my sister as a weapon. I go away for 10 minutes to cool down so we can talk like adults, and when I come back with a calm tone, she immediately opens up with a snappy quip, though I forgot what. I told her ‚ÄúIm not here to argue, I just want to discuss a game plan with you. I‚Äôm not refusing to leave the house period, but I‚Äôm not rushing to a storm shelter while there‚Äôs no immediate threat, or even a watch, especially with how much (physical)pain I‚Äôm in‚Äù. I told her my radar will give us 10x the head start we would need due to us being literally a mile from the shelter. This parts blurry to think about, but it escalated into another argument, so I walked out of the room to the living room. My sister, 10, talked to me and calmly and respectfully agreed with me, in fact she even whispered it with no intent of our mother hearing it. Unfortunately she wasn‚Äôt quiet enough, and my mother yells from her room ‚Äújust go the fuck to bed‚Äù to her. I told my sister right then and there that she is fine, and free to go do what she wants while I deal with our mother. My mother‚Äôs barely responding at this point due to alcohol and funny gummies(that or muscle relaxers), so we got nowhere with that. I go back to my sister, and said if she wants to talk, I‚Äôm completely free, and so we did. We talked a bit about our mother‚Äôs alcohol addiction, and that she‚Äôs a good person fighting demons, and that goes on for 30 minutes or so. We wrap the conversation up, and perfect timing, we‚Äôre now under tornado watch. I go to my mother‚Äôs room to let her know that now‚Äôs the time to keep your eyes peeled and be ready to go, but now she‚Äôs so unbelievably drunk and high that I had to push her with almost all my strength to get a drunken mumble out of her. Well over half the bottle she had gotten a few hours ago was gone. I could not get her up. I knew at that moment I had to get out of that house. I waited for the storm to pass(no tornado came), spent some time with my sister, packed my essentials and left at 11:00 that night.  




This is the conversation we had the next day:


Me: ‚ÄúFor what it's worth mom, I still love you and always will, the same way i have my entire life, I have no negative feelings for you and think you're a great person going through bad things. But I'm 18 now, and I have the chance to move to a healthier environment, one that has someone that can be there for me at all times, a household that always wants better for themselves. I lived with you through my childhood because I could depend on my mom, but i don't feel the same way anymore. I know you do your best and I will always love you for it, it's admirable. But sometimes the best you can do doesn't always result in the best ending. I need away from everything. I need away from you working yourself to death for no money and drinking and getting high into oblivion when you're home. I need away from a household that can start an argument involving using a child as a weapon over the weather. I need away from a household with people that don‚Äôt want any better for themselves, and away from a household with no priorities. Last night, when we were finally under tornado watch, I couldn't wake you. I shook you as hard as I could and got a drunken mumble out of you. You chose to take a muscle relaxer and drink (over) half a bottle of fireball instead of dealing with your emotions and the issue at hand. If the tornado actually did come, l would have had to drive *sister* to the shelter and leave you. Reasons like that is why I feel like I can't stay anymore. I want you as an active part of my life, but living with you isn't healthy for me anymore. I can't sit there and watch you kill yourself.

66,1e2bg2t,AITA for sleeping through the day my girlfriend and I were supposed to meet up?,"So my girlfriend and I live pretty far away from each other, and being broke college students without a driving license, we can't really meet up with each other too often. I thought I lucked out this summer, but it turns out she's going on a trip with her family, plus she's working. We finally settled on a date to meet, (July 11th) and we left it at that. The problem is, there was literally no plan whatsoever. We didn't decide 1) where to meet 2) what we would do and 3) what time we would get there. I suppose it's kind of on both of us, but I never bothered to reach out to her until two days later. That was when she revealed that she might not be able to even make it because she has to start packing. Frustrated, I said okay. I tried calling her a bunch of times after that to get some sort of idea on what we were going to do when we got there, but she didn't respond. I texted her the day before to ask for some sort of plan, and even suggested something but she didn't see it. I was staying up pretty late the day before, so I just slept through the day we were supposed to meet until I woke up at 5 PM. I then got a massive shock as I realized I had about thirty missed calls and God knows how many texts. She was absolutely livid because she was trying to reach out to figure something out, and I was just not responding. In my defense, it was unintentional, and it was incredibly shitty to make plans the day of anyways.

68,1e2al5i,AITA for refusing to help my sick mom buy storm supplies? ,"Recently we got hit by a Cat4 storm, and I made a decision I've been reeling over. 

I (27F) stay home with my mom (64F) who's recovering from a stroke among other medical issues. Due to her weakness, I help her with most physical tasks. One such task is errands like shopping. We don't have a car so there's a fair bit of walking between taking public transport to do anything. Lately, she's been asking me to carry way more than I can physically handle. 

To prep for Beryl, she sent me an extensive list of supplies, way too much for me to carry alone. I told her this is too much and I'll be leaving things off the list so I can actually carry it. Mom got mad about it and removed the money off the card she gave me, saying if I won't get everything we'll just go through Beryl with nothing. Not wanting to go though my first major storm empty handed, I scraped together what little money I had and quietly left to buy what supplies I could for myself, which wasn't much.

The next day, day before the storm. Mom approaches me to get dressed cuz she's getting a ride to drop us off at the supermarket for supplies and she needs me to help her. It's chaos on the road with empty shelves and last minute shoppers everywhere, while there was lots of stock & less people the day before. I told her I'm not going, my time to shop was yesterday and she thwarted that. She was very weak and dizzy that day but I still refused to go with her, in favor of doing last minute prep of my own. My uncle ended up staying with her instead due to worry. 

Fam says I'm wrong, friends say she takes me for granted and I did the right thing. I'm torn. AITA?

Edit: the list was mostly fodder and perishables. I intended to forego those items to lessen the load. 
Edit2: I am not in America. I bought hurricane supplies with my own money. My conundrum was my refusal to accompany my mom during the last minute rush for perishable items.

69,1e2aha6,AITA for losing my shit after my dad asked me for a favour?,"For some context: I (28F) have been living with my parents since February to save costs while attending grad school. It is hectic and asks a lot for from me and on weekends I like to have slow mornings. I am the eldest daughter so naturally everyday, someone wants something from me and I don‚Äôt really get time to myself. I have a younger a sister who my parents pass over for errands and favours and I‚Äôm the default child to turn to. The household I live in is toxic and I always try my best to keep the peace while (trying) to maintain boundaries. 

This morning I woke up later than I usually do and wanted to get a head start on doing my laundry, eating breakfast and doing my schoolwork. As soon as I exit my bedroom to begin doing my laundry, my father tells me I have a whole host of errands I need to run before the shops close (I live in a small town so shops close relatively early on weekends). I only had about an hour to get ready and I was told my dad was complaining that I was taking far too long and the shops were closing early. I hadn‚Äôt broken my fast by then. I got dressed and he stops me and says well it‚Äôs too late now and I should go again tomorrow. I lost my shit and started banging around and complaining how much I hate living in this house and I cried my eyeballs out. He always bombards me with tasks on the day of without a care about my own plans for the day. He hardly asks me what my plans are, or even asks me to run errands for me. He instructs me like I‚Äôm his personal assistant. 

Mind you, two nights before my entire family left a hot mess in the kitchen and I spent two hours cleaning it whilst he was bitching and moaning and saying a lot of mean things about the people that he lives with. I went to bed hearing about how someone feels about living with us. The next morning, I wake up to the very same yelling and moaning (and banging stuff for no reason). My evening had been ruined and then my morning too. He didn‚Äôt apologise for his behavior (he never does) and had guests over yesterday that he expected me to serve with a smile on my face and be forgiving. 

Now the whole household is tense and everyone has retreated to their corners. AITA for reacting the way I did? 

EDIT: I see I‚Äôm getting mixed responses, mostly negative ones from what seems to be mean spirited people. 
I understand very well that my reaction was definitely out of pocket. My parents welcomed me home with open arms. While I understand that it may shock some of you that I am live at home at my age, it is completely normal where I‚Äôm from to move back home. It is a temporary situation and I‚Äôve only been home 6 months. I want to mention again that I pay for my studies and used up my savings to pay for my studies. I am extremely grateful that I get to be home rent free; and I express my gratitude by helping out. I also am not home sitting all day. I am working very hard at school to secure my future and build a life for myself. It doesn‚Äôt mean that because I live at home I should endure a toxic household. I can tell a lot of you didn‚Äôt grow up in a loving environment judging by your responses. 

Another edit: I see me calling people mean spirited makes them want to double down on saying YTA. If your response is rude, I will respond in kind. Offer your opinions but take note of your deliveries please!

70,1e2acsk,AITA for not buying my son's friend something ,"So a few days back I had my son (10) and his friend (13) out with me as I needed to get some things.

While out my son asked to go to a store that had something he'd been saving for, as he now had the money saved up. So the 3 of us went, my son bought what he wanted and we left. 

When we met with my wife and she saw this, she asked if I had bought his friend anything while there, I explained no and that I hadn't actually bought our child anything either, he bought it himself, this resulted in her having a go at me because it wasn't fair on his friend to be stood there with no money unable to get anything. 

I was completely side struck by this and wasn't expecting it, I genuinely hadn't thought about it (tbh I was just back from work, starving and tired and had to go straight out to the store with the boys as soon as I arrived home, so wasn't in a clear frame of mind).

Not really expecting it I said I hadn't thought and I made a mistake. This wasn't good enough, she stormed off with my sons friend and bought him something of equal value (¬£30) and has barely spoken to me since. 

For clarity, had my own child not had ¬£30 I also wouldn't have bought him the thing he wanted, that's not a small amount of money  to spend randomly for a family of our size, and to me justified not doing it for his friend either. 

I'm now thinking, surely this is now unfair on our own child if you want to be granular about it, as he had to spend his own money on something, while his parents went and spent that same amount on his friend. Makes no sense to me, despite me acknowledging at the time that it was a mistake, having thought about it I'm not sure it was as much or a crime as it was painted to be.

","So I work in a predominantly female workplace and I‚Äôve always just gotten along better with women more so I don‚Äôt see that as a problem. (no I am not trying to sleep with any) I also get along very well with the male coworkers, but my closest friends here are women.

Recently I was having a break that coincided with a coworker who recently got out of a relationship and was venting to me about how rough dating has been. She was talking about how hard it is to meet good looking guys that want relationships.

I gave some half paying attention response, she said that she wishes she could just meet a guy here at work, but none of the guys here are remotely attractive.

So I‚Äôll be honest I was offended by this. I mean, I know I‚Äôm not a model but I still think it‚Äôs rude to come out and say ‚Äúoh you all are unattractive‚Äù to someone like that.

I didn‚Äôt really think before I spoke and I said, I get it, all the girls here aren‚Äôt much to look at either. She got kinda upset and asked me what that was supposed to mean. At that point my mouth had already shot off so I doubled down and told her that there wasn‚Äôt a single pretty woman in our shop (which isn‚Äôt necessarily true).

She got very upset with me and got cold after that. She also told the other girls I said that and now they‚Äôre being passive aggressive towards me about it.

72,1e29jjw,AITAH? I refused to share with my siblings ,"Hello everyone this is my first time sharing this story 
I won't take much of your time but i need to know what do you think about this
I 22m suffered all this time because of my family 
And it got worse when my grandparents left me there house and some money after they passed away five years ago 
I am the youngest of four siblings usually the youngest supposed to be the spoiled one but not this time .
All my life i was treated like a butler and not a son 
Well not all of it because i got raised by my grandparents since we lived across the street from them and i was there favorite grandchild 
But i don't think that that was the reason for my family to treat me the way it did because i was the unwanted child born  9 years after my siblings (35 f , 33f and 31m) and they didn't miss a chance to remind me of that always doing all the chores around the house and always forced to take responsibility for there mistakes i worked in the family farm since i was 12 and got paid by my grandparents and uncles so i never asked my parents to get me anything because i can afford it by myself  even when i couldn't my grandparents gave me the rest .
Thats not issue here but in 2016 my grandfather passed away of old age and in his will he gave his house to me the farm to myfather and his brothers along with other things to the rest of the family 
He had one condition i am not allowed to sell the house or give it to anyone else until my grandmother died and i will take care of her 
I gladly accept that condition because they took care of me through out my childhood and gave me the warmth that i need it and raised me to be a strong man so i saw that condition as a way to pay them back for everything 
Three years later my grandmother passed away in her sleep but since she inherited all of my grandfather money she divided it between me and one of my cousins (25m) because she helped me taking my grandmother to the doctors appointment cooked food for us and was there when we needed her unlike my siblings 
After she passed away the hole family was gathered by my grandparents lawyer to reed the will they were shocked thinking that my grand mother will gave everything to them because of the sweetheart she is and i heard my mother saying at least we got the house and the money is with our son so he will share with the rest of the family. 
At first i couldn't believe the entitlement then i spoke up for the first time ever and i said (i would rather burn it all then letting you your husband or any of your horrible children touch it)
Am i the a hole for doing that for refusing share what is now mine the story doesn't end there but i feel like i took alot of your time already and i am sorry for the bad english it is not my native language ",Not the A-hole,2024-07-13,"AITAH?

75,1e28usl,AITA for telling my friend she is acting crazy? ,"I (21F) have a close friend (21F) I will refer to her as Megan. 

I have been friends with Megan since middle school. We are really close. She is like my sister. She has always had insecurities, used to be shy, and struggled with social anxiety. She has gotten therapy and is now much more confident in public, but I can tell internally , she still struggles with self esteem issues. She‚Äôs way to focused on her looks, to the point she won't go out if she doesn't feel pretty that day or if we are going to join a social event, she won't eat until the event so she doesn't look bloated etc.

We also went to the same high school. She had a toxic ‚Äúfriend‚Äù  who used to tease her because of her looks, particularly because of her weight. Megan was never fat, but she used to be curvier. This girl, whom I will refer to as Ellen, used to tease her for having thick thighs, a big butt, and whatnot. Since then, Megan has lost a lot of weight. She is very skinny now, which I‚Äôm also concerned about, but she says she‚Äôs fine. 

Megan still follows Ellen on Instagram. Every time Ellen posts something, she shows me and comments on how big Ellen has gotten, saying ""karma is doing her job."" I understand why Megan is petty, but I think this is very unhealthy behavior, so I try not to comment and change the topic.

This time, I outright told her that I don't think Ellen is fat; she has just gotten curvier and is not as skinny as she used to be in high school, which is normal because she's an adult woman now.

Megan said it's funny I say that because she used to be smaller than Ellen is now but was teased by Ellen for it. Now she is skinny and Ellen has gotten way bigger. This is karma doing its job. Megan asked why I can't be happy for her as her friend.

I said that there is nothing to be happy about because being skinny isn't a competition. I know what Ellen did was messed up, and I am sorry for that, but we were in high school, and now we are adults. I was going to say that she should stop obsessing with Ellen's body, but she cut me off and started yelling, ""Oh right, it's normal for Ellen to be the size she is now because she's an adult curvy woman and looks good, but I was the fat high school girl, right? It didn't look good on me the way it does on Ellen, right?""

I tried to tell her that I didn't say that, but she didn't let me and went on saying, ""I know, Ellen still wins because adult women are supposed to be curvy, not twigs. That's a high school girl thing. I should have been skinny back then, not now. It doesn't mean anything anymore. Look, even you think that.""

I was in shock. I told her to stop because she's acting crazy right now. She told me to fuck off, that I'm her best friend, and I should be on her side, not call her crazy. Then she left. When I went back home, I texted her that I wanted to talk this out, but she didn't text me back.

76,1e28bf4,AITA for canceling on a night out with friends last minute?,"This week, I planned a night out with a group of friends for Friday. One of them is my best friend, Alex, who used to be my roommate for two years. Now that we both live with our girlfriends, we‚Äôre not as close anymore but still very good friends. Alex is going on a month-long holiday soon, so this night was supposed to be a final hangout with friends before he leaves.

We organized it in a group chat with five friends. Usually, we try to meet once a week for a restaurant outing and sometimes activities like bowling. Most of the time, it‚Äôs me, Alex, and whoever from the group can join that night. The others are younger, enjoy partying, and are rarely available. Alex and I are 30, and our party nights are kind of over, so we don‚Äôt have much else to do. I understand that they want to enjoy their youth, and whenever we do meet up, we have a great time.

The plan was set for Friday, but on Thursday, another group of friends invited Alex and me to grab food and drinks. We‚Äôve known this second group longer, and they are closer to us in age and friendship. We just went to a restaurant, had good food, chatted, and went home by 10 PM. In the taxi back home, we got stuck in traffic, and Alex watched TikToks on his phone while I was talking to him, so I thought that was enough social time for him.

Today is the night I‚Äôm supposed to go out with Alex and the first group of friends, but I‚Äôm feeling tired. I didn‚Äôt sleep well last night, and I work six days a week, about 10 hours a day, at a stressful job with responsibilities. I also enjoy my alone time to recharge, especially since I‚Äôm an introvert.

So, I messaged the group, ‚ÄúSorry guys, I‚Äôm really tired and staying home. I‚Äôll see you next time, enjoy!‚Äù Everyone understood since it‚Äôs rare to catch everybody, and I didn‚Äôt feel too guilty because I already saw Alex the night before. He could still enjoy the evening with the others.

I knew Alex would message me (directly, not in the group) to insist that I come because it‚Äôs his last night. And he did. I rarely skip an occasion to go out, but anytime I do, he texts me in a passive-aggressive way (or at least that‚Äôs how it feels to me) to insist that I join. Personally, if a friend cancels last minute, I understand they have their own life and plans, and I focus on enjoying the night with those who are present.

77,1e28b4x,AITA for telling my aunt she can't call me a liar and swoop in years later and expect to be my hero?,"Sorry if my title is confusing with most of the contents of the post. But I want to provide you with the background.

So my dad had me (17f) and my brother (15m). Our mom died when we were 2 and 4 months old. A year later he met Mel and they got married. Mel had two daughters (23f and 22f). I'm not sure if their dad died or if he just wasn't around. But they lived with us 100% of the time. I don't remember a time before Mel and my stepsisters. Mel was so happy with my brother and he became her son and her pride and joy. She never cared about me and never expressed an interest in me. My dad was very similar. He basically forgot about me being his daughter. Mel still showed an interest in her daughters but they hated the fact she claimed my brother as her son and showed so much obsession about having a boy and I get it because she was all they had before. They hated me. They hated my brother too, and wanted nothing to do with him, but he was so good having two parents that he never cared about siblings. He calls himself an only child. I'd hoped to be close to my stepsisters but they bullied me and said I would never be their family.

My grandparents noticed that I was left out of a lot, noticed the bullying and the rejections. They live out of state and when they'd come to visit and we'd all go out I was left behind with them while my dad and Mel took the other three out to amusement parks and stuff. Mel would tell me to my face in front of them that she's not my mom and yet beam when my brother called her mom. They also noticed that when my brother and stepsisters got treats I rarely, if ever, did. They brought it up a few times and were basically ignored. I know they had this big talk with dad about it and he denied anything was going on. I also know they asked my aunt, who lived close by and saw us a lot, to keep an eye on me. She didn't.

Two years ago I'd gotten really depressed after being stuck with dad, Mel and my brother during Covid and being ignored, that I told my aunt about everything and asked if I could live with her. She got pissed on my dad's behalf and she called me a liar and told me not to be so jealous, that I wasn't a kid anymore. And no, I couldn't live with her. She was so mad at me that I avoided seeing her for months. I was so afraid she would ridicule me in front of them. For some reason she realized a couple of weeks ago that I wasn't lying. She came and told me I could live with her now and she told me it was awful what my dad let happen and that I shouldn't be there anymore but she would get me out and she'd protect me. I was shocked. It came out of literal nowhere. She didn't apologize for what she said before though. And so I told her I'd stay. That I didn't think living with her was a better idea anymore. She got mad and asked me why not and I told her because she can't call me a liar and then expect to swoop in and for me to see her as a hero. She told me I got so hung up on nothing.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-13,"AITA for telling my aunt she can't call me a liar and swoop in years later and expect to be my hero? Sorry if my title is confusing with most of the contents of the post. But I want to provide you with the background.

So my dad had me (17f) and my brother (15m). Our mom died when we were 2 and 4 months old. A year later he met Mel and they got married. Mel had two daughters (23f and 22f). I'm not sure if their dad died or if he just wasn't around. But they lived with us 100% of the time. I don't remember a time before Mel and my stepsisters. Mel was so happy with my brother and he became her son and her pride and joy. She never cared about me and never expressed an interest in me. My dad was very similar. He basically forgot about me being his daughter. Mel still showed an interest in her daughters but they hated the fact she claimed my brother as her son and showed so much obsession about having a boy and I get it because she was all they had before. They hated me. They hated my brother too, and wanted nothing to do with him, but he was so good having two parents that he never cared about siblings. He calls himself an only child. I'd hoped to be close to my stepsisters but they bullied me and said I would never be their family.

My grandparents noticed that I was left out of a lot, noticed the bullying and the rejections. They live out of state and when they'd come to visit and we'd all go out I was left behind with them while my dad and Mel took the other three out to amusement parks and stuff. Mel would tell me to my face in front of them that she's not my mom and yet beam when my brother called her mom. They also noticed that when my brother and stepsisters got treats I rarely, if ever, did. They brought it up a few times and were basically ignored. I know they had this big talk with dad about it and he denied anything was going on. I also know they asked my aunt, who lived close by and saw us a lot, to keep an eye on me. She didn't.

78,1e286wh,AITA for for ruining my own gender reveal party?,"I'm pregnant with a baby boy due in November. My fianc√© and I didn't care much about the sex of our child, so we didn't make too much noise about it once we found out. The only people we'd informed were our parents, their partners and our siblings.

Prior to this, my father's girlfriend of 3 years had been asking me about my plans for a gender reveal party. I've always been clear about not wanting one. When I announced my son's gender to them, she expressed disappointment that I hadn't changed my mind about a party.

I don't like gender reveals. Never have, never will. I prefer baby showers, which I think feel more about the actual child. I never tried to hide that opinion, either.

Days later, my father's girlfriend invited me over for tea at their apartment (my dad was out of town). When I got there, about a dozen people popped out of hiding to surprise me. There were pink and blue decorations everywhere, which made what was going on pretty clear.

As I stood there in shock, my father's girlfriend excitedly told me they were throwing me a surprise gender reveal party. Since I'd already told her, she had taken it upon herself to order a cake with colorful frosting, decorate the apartment and invite a bunch of people over. 

The guests included her mother (whom I don't get along with), some of her friends, my MIL (not my mom) and four of my friends. As I later found out, my MIL and friends had been told I'd changed my mind about gender reveals.

I had not. Still in the doorway, I looked over at everyone and said, ""It's a boy. You guys can go home now."" I left without looking back.

Hours later, my father called me furious that I'd ruined the party. He said his girlfriend had put a lot of effort, money and love into planning it, and I should have shown respect and gratitude for it. Apparently, she hadn't stopped crying since I left.

It's been almost a week, and they're both still upset. Even after I explained I never wanted that party in the first place, they're insisting I could have sucked it up for an hour, or at least cut the cake.

81,1e27tqc,AITA For not pulling my weight around the house?,"  I (18F) live with my mother (37F) and her long term boyfriend (44M), who moved in a year ago. I have 3 chores in the house which is to keep my room clean, wash the dishes, and walk the dog. Very simple things.

 The issue comes from my mother. I clean my room every week after it becomes messy. It‚Äôs basically a reset. I will say that sometimes my room can be really messy for up to 2 weeks when i‚Äôm really struggling with motivation. Though if I‚Äôm left alone about it I‚Äôll end up doing it.

 Onto the dishes, I can use the dishwasher but she has rules of what can and can‚Äôt go in which is perfectly fine. She believes that none of the pots or pans can be placed in the dishwasher. I think the issue is that some of the pots and pans are older than I am and she refuses to replace them. The other issue is when I wash them. She wants them washed at night which is fine however her and her boyfriend make it so much harder than it needs to be. Examples are:
1. Leaving dishes around the house
2. Making dishes after I do them 
3. Making full meals in the middle of the night
4. Expecting me to wash dishes after I just worked a shift right after school

With the dog I definitely struggled at first with him and did end up getting help. Then once school starts again my mother took over his morning walk because she was working from home. He goes out early in the morning but she wants it be 5:30 am. Then came the afternoon walks after school where I was expected to walk the dog before I head off the work in 30 minutes. I thought this was a little odd considering my mom got home less than 30 minutes after me from work. She also has the habit of instead of getting up herself she waste time calling me from my sleep to do it.


The reason I made this post is because of my mom‚Äôs boyfriend. He moved in almost a year ago now and I immediately noticed something. When he moved in he had a TON of junk thrown around the house that he still hasn‚Äôt done much about. My mom makes comments about them maybe once a month. He cooks in the house and that‚Äôs all he does. After he moved in I noticed there were always way more dishes in the sink at night and made a comment on it. I personally believe that the person who is making all these dishes should be the one to clean them, but apparently he can‚Äôt do dishes because he doesn‚Äôt know how to do the dishes. He often makes messes in the kitchen and then leaves them there. He also has a chore in the house to take the trash out which he never does. It‚Äôs no secret that I hate my mom‚Äôs boyfriend. She never ask her boyfriend to do anything because ‚Äúit‚Äôll never get done.‚Äù When I don‚Äôt do my chores she‚Äôs always yelling at me and he‚Äôs calling me lazy. Though if I do them all I get is snarky remarks about it. Which of course makes me demotivated to do anything. There are more examples I left out because this is already so long.

Problems arise when it comes to living together though, I don't have many duties. Just cleaning the bathroom on sunday and looking out for the kitchen every morning. I wake up and clean the dishes for everyone, then I take out the trash and sweep the floor and clean crumbs or the stove  (we don't really have like a regular stove it's those fancy, black thingie ones, I forget the word) if there's oil on it or it looks decrepit. 

I've gotten a number of corrections which piss my mom's bf off but she has told him that she didn't teach us barely anything so we have to learn now (?). Regardless, I just kept doing stuff taking those into account. 

(note by us I mean me and my younger sibling)

Apparently though, I keep doing things wrong since he sees there keeps being crumbs (I swear this has to be someone coming in later) and I keep forgetting to sweep where the trash can is which to be fair is probably accurate.

The real issue arrived today when my mom ran out of rice milk or almond milk (idk what struck her fancy this time) and she asked her bf to look out for things since he works from home. He called me and my sibling out instead, mentioning what I said before and that he always had to bear the burden of the crumbs and such as well as the fact that we spent four days without regular shmegular milk.

It seems he didn't buy any to see if we noticed and did, of course I noticed. However, since he usually buys milk for his daughter and no one will perish without milk I assumed that it just wasn't needed. He made a couple shopping trips here and there and specifically didn't buy milk so I kept assuming something changed and he didn't need. I didn't want to buy milk just for myself either.

But from his POV, I had failed the test by not buying it and didn't notice at all proving once more my selfish and disorganized ways. 

For more context, groceries need to be bought over all but they kept saying they needed to and would so I just, hoped that would be the case, eventually, some day.

Now, my mom is saying that once my sibling leaves (long story) she'll just move with me since this isn't working and that she's already told us how our attitude is affecting her relationship to no avail.

I really don't know how to feel since there's always these situations where I think I'm doing things correctly for the longest time and it turns out that no, plus the times where I'm supposed to ""notice"" something, I rationalize that it's there for a reason and then fail.

My sibling on the other hand is claiming it's my turn to do things that I've done every day while she was unconcious during the morning- which, is, ok. I guess

She also sent an article about ‚Äúperinatal mental health effects on baby‚Äù to my husband while I was pregnant because I had an argument with her about putting calamine lotion on my toddler after I had said no. 

When our first was born and was only a week old she asked my husband if he could take the baby up alone to see her and she got angry when we said no and complained that she also needed to bond with the baby. 

She has talked negatively about me to my husband‚Äôs friends wives and told them to ‚Äútake her side‚Äù. 

This has caused so many issues in my relationship with my husband because I would ideally like to go no contact but my husband takes his mothers side a lot and he thinks I over react or I need to just forgive her. I resent him for it.

When our first was born and was only a week old she asked my husband if he could take the baby up alone to see her and she got angry when we said no and complained that she also needed to bond with the baby. 

She has talked negatively about me to my husband‚Äôs friends wives and told them to ‚Äútake her side‚Äù. 

This has caused so many issues in my relationship with my husband because I would ideally like to go no contact but my husband takes his mothers side a lot and he thinks I over react or I need to just forgive her. I resent him for it.

Opinions‚Ä¶ am I the asshole or is it ok for me to be distancing myself from my MIL.

84,1e27huv,AITA for telling my sister I think she was insensitive to our SIL?,"I (29f) have two siblings. Oldest sibling is Kade (37m) and middle sibling is Ronnie (34f). Kade is married to Ashley (36f). Ronnie is married to Chase (35m). Ashley and I are really close. She and Kade started dating when I was still really young and she was always like another sister to me. Ashley has a pretty heavy background. Her mom left when she was only a baby and she was raised by her dad for 15 years. Then her dad died very suddenly and tragically and she was sent to live with an aunt who didn't really care about her. She and my brother knew each other and were dating at the time and we became her surrogate family. From then on she used to talk about how nice it would be to name a baby after her dad some day. Her dad's name was Shay. We all knew her dad's name and how meaningful it was to her.

Ashley and Kade have run into some fertility issues. After many years of being told it was unexplained infertility, last year they learned it was something that could be treated. Ashley underwent a surgery and was given some medication. In that time Ronnie became pregnant and had her first son (she has two girls also). When my nephew was 3 weeks old Ronnie and Chase announced that their son's name was Shay.

Ashley said nothing. She smiled and congratulated Ronnie. She broke down and cried with me and Kade. She hadn't known Ronnie was planning this and was incredibly hurt that Ronnie chose to use that name out of all the names out there.

Kade confronted Ronnie and he called her out for only announcing the name when our nephew was 3 weeks old and everything was finalized. He told Ronnie that she knew it would hurt Ashley, she knew it would be something that would upset her, and she did it anyway. Ronnie argued back and the two of them have not spoken since.

Ronnie complained to me about Kade and about Ashley. She said Ashley needed to get over herself. Ronnie also spoke in a way that sounded very much like she wanted Ashley to get over the name and chose it out of some weird spite. I honestly feel like there was some jealousy there that Ashley was so close to getting pregnant and Ronnie used Shay to get back at her. Ronnie focused a lot on the attention Ashley got, both for her infertility and also her dad. She seemed so bitter which was sad because Ronnie and Ashley used to be so close. She told me them choosing the name had nothing to do with Ashley and she and Chase just thought Shay was cute. I told her she was insensitive and I told her I believe she knew she was doing it out of spite. Ronnie freaked out at me for taking Ashley's side and she told me she should be allowed to choose any name she wants to.

85,1e26wb8,AITA for being unpleasant to my mother?,"My mother has always struggled with the concept of ""storage"", so she has gone through about 10 phones since she got her first one. (In the past, USB drives were not always used, and they were often used to store important documents, not random photos.) Having had so many phones, she ended up creating multiple Facebook accounts because she always forgot and lost all her passwords ; so now, I have to manage them for her when she could easily write them down somewhere.

Another issue is her obsession with taking photos obviously. Since my childhood, she would often ask me to take pictures of her. When I was young, it was enjoyable and brought us closer. However, as I grew older, I found less pleasure in doing so, and she started yelling at me for anything she did not like, which made me start to resent this routine.

Sometimes, she needs to make ""important"" posts on Facebook, but either her phones start malfunctioning due to the high storage or the computer is performing well, so she asks for my help because she says I am more used to and quicker at achieving what she needs.

Throught the years, I have always helped her with these Facebook posts when she asked, and when I had the time. But over time, I quickly became frustrated because her posts took too long. She would say: *""Just a few more minutes/photos...""* and it was never true. When I told her: *""Tell me everything you need at once.""*, she would add more layers.

This led to rare occasions where I lost my temper with her, unintentionally either by aggressively typing on my computer or by responding loudly: *""I understand (what you are asking).""* To which she would reply with something like: *""You are selfish. I do not ask you all the time to take pictures or make these posts. I have always raised you (...)""* - you know the kind of mother's speech after an argument.

I love my mother because she is my mother, and of course, I love helping her because she is my mother. She even asks for my help when I am free and not at the moment, which proves that she respects me. However, all the unpleasant memories from the beginning, combined with some disdainful behaviors of hers, make me want to lose my temper more and more.

When you have had a tiring day or week at school, see your mother on her phone from morning till night, try every day not to burst into tears, when you finally get a chance to rest but have to deal with taking photos and/or Facebook posts, knowing you might get yelled at sooner or later...

88,1e25dgf,WIBTA for refusing to talk to my parents because they didn't tell me my dog died ?,"
So I ( 20 f ) recently found out from my cousin that my dearest dog Betty passed away a few weeks ago.

Betty was my doll, my best friend and she was very special to me.

I remember begging on m knees for a puppy and when I got her I cried.

She was a sweet, dumb, happy lovely dog who would bark at everything that moved.

She was 15 years old.
 
She had tan fur, white furrer feet, black ears a cute long wagging tail that was white on the tip.

She had such beautiful brown eyes that would shine whenever she was begging for my food and she loved belly rubs.

She would hide under the car after doing something wrong.

She would wag her tail super hard if you praises her

She was my dog.

She was mine.

And it hurts so much that she's gone.

My cousin stays with us because of reason and I called him to check up on him as I do every now and then and asked how everyone was doing and jokingly asked if he and Betty were still fighting ( he doesn't really how playful she was but she adored him ) only for him to tell me that she had died a few weeks back.

He was the one who buried her


I asked what happened and he said he just found her like that in the morning and he didn't know what happened.

I thought it was a joke a first, but now I know it's not.


It hurt.


Here's the thing I talk to my parents every 2 days and not once had they told me about it.


When I brought it up to them they brushed it off dismissively and said yes it was true but they would be getting another dog soon so it didn't really matter.

I was so angry when I heard that that I yelled at them and cut the call.

Something I've never done before.

I was scared and wanted to call back and apologize, but I didn't because of how nonchalant they were about my Betty still makes me boil.


I haven't picked their calls since but I've been getting calls from family members demanding I apologize and that I was rude and there making me second guess myself.



So  I'm I the AITA ?

When I bought it, I used it once only. After two weeks, my step dad asked to use it. He then allowed my two sisters to use it too without asking me if it was ok. I had to deliver it and pick it back up myself, despite my step dad being able to drive. 

When it was returned to me, I didn't use it again owing to working away and being quite time poor. 

Two weeks ago, he asked to use it again. Again I dropped it off and he said he'd bring it back. Last week, my sister told me that he's since dropped it at hers as she wanted to use it - again without asking me. She then told me that she turned it on, and there was a really bad burning smell and she couldn't use it. 

I'm really frustrated because 1) The cleaner has been passed around to everyone without my permission, 2) My sister doesn't drive so again I'm having to make a 1.5hr round trip to collect it when I don't have that much time, and 3) If the cleaner is broken I'm going to be really p*ssed because I've only used it once myself and it cost me ¬£295.

My sister claims she didn't break it and also that she called out my step dad who also denied it breaking, citing that he's ""googled"" it and it's a known issue. 

WIBTA if, when I collect it and it is indeed broken, I message them both and ask them to pay half each for a new model, knowing they can't afford it? ",0.0,0.030503634363412857,0,1

Reece has been showing really concerning behaviours, I feel like I‚Äôm anxious every time he‚Äôs with us for the week. I‚Äôve never been with someone whose had children before so it‚Äôs difficult for me to navigate this, my boyfriend also labels it as normal behaviour and doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that serious so I need the advice as other. 

Reece will jump up and down off the furniture, refuse to share with Kaleb even with Kalebs toys, hits Kaleb, is extremely rough with Kaleb, completely ignores you when your trying to get his attention to discuss why certain behaviours are hurtful and not nice. 

He blatantly says ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù When asked if he wants to play nicely with Kaleb, he will throw things around the living room even when he‚Äôs been told this is dangerous and could hurt someone. 

I spoke to my boyfriend about this and he speaks to Reese but he does something else in the space of 5 minutes, it‚Äôs getting to the point where I am thinking of leaving the relationship, I love his children but my child is my first priority I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for him to experience this nor is it safe.

94,1e23wef,AITA for being messy when my roommates are too ,"quick backstory i've had bad roommates in the past and have been paranoid about leaving the bathroom clean, not a single hair on the ground or in the shower, nothing on the counter, etc and since these people (two girls who seem to be friends and one who's separate but i like her) seemed to be living messy i figured it couldnt hurt to slack off here and there.

what i mean by living messy is like, they'll leave clumps of hair on the bathroom floor and occasionally hair in the shower drain, and the bathroom counter has definitely been completely wet a few times and there's no hooks so the counter is the only place to put my clean clothes.

the kitchen is also very messy, the two friends have occupied a whole third of the counter for their washed dishes when me and the other one just keep it in our cupboards like we're supposed to and the sink is always piled so high i can barely fill a water bottle. to add to that it seems the kitchen floor is never clean and as the cherry on top there's flies everywhere, including the bathroom.



now the real question: their top complaint about me is ""skid marks"" in the toilet. i clean up after myself and always check, but today the two knocked on my door telling me i left a mess, so i went to see, and there was a literal speck. it almost looked like someone had accidentally drawn a dot with a sharpie in the corner and i missed it because i couldnt see it from an angle. it's not even on top, which is gross, it was inside.

this question is a bit embarrassing to ask considering leaving skid marks is unsanitary and inconsiderate to roommates and i get that, but i personally think they're overreacting and being hypocritical by leaving messes but then embarrassing me in the group chat for something as small as this. i need more opinions, am i really in the wrong or are they just being dramatic?",Everyone Sucks,2024-07-13,"AITA for being messy when my roommates are too  quick backstory i've had bad roommates in the past and have been paranoid about leaving the bathroom clean, not a single hair on the ground or in the shower, nothing on the counter, etc and since these people (two girls who seem to be friends and one who's separate but i like her) seemed to be living messy i figured it couldnt hurt to slack off here and there.

95,1e23snd,WIBTA for breaking the door?,"Hello all. I'm (19 f) in a bit of trouble as of just recently regarding a broken door. So for context my father has a short temper but he's still nice at times even though he'll blow up at the slightest inconvenience. My younger brother (18 m) is a bit like that , a bit spoiled and has a lot of unwarranted hatred towards me. So I live in a duplex, my father stepmom, brother and I living in one side and my grandma with two others living in the other side. I've been recently staying over and sleeping at my grandma's side of the house and haven't really been spending time at home other than playing video games, meals and showers. For the past few nights whenever I go home to shower my brother will lock the door to our room whenever I'm showering and each time I get out I have to struggle a bit to unlock the door. I've been getting tired of doing that so i decided to stick around by the bathroom door and wait. a few seconds later i hear him get up fron his bed and lock the door. so i head back to the door and knock so that he'll open it up. i ask him politely to not lock the door. he got a bit upset and said the i dont even sleep there anymore and he can do whatever he wants not understanding that i have to go back in there to get a few things after I've finished. then he decided to try and shut the door to lock it up again but i placed my foot on the corner of the door so that it'll prevent it to close again. i kept on asking and telling him to keep it unlocked. he didn't care and continued on trying to force the door shut. after 2 more tries it cracked a little. This is the second time our room door has been broken for something like this. Last time it happened my father sternly warned us that if it ever happens again, he won't be fixing it. Whenever my father gets really upset he's very vulgar towards us and says many hurtful things, his main one being ""the older you two get the stupider you become"". My father and I don't have an ideal relationship that I'd like to have because of his temper. I'm afraid of what will happen once morning comes and didn't know what to do so that he'll believe me and not whatever lie my brother would make up to cover his butt. I decided to make a group text with my father, stepmom and me and text them everything that happened with an apology. I also offered to pay for damages. I really don't believe what  happened was my fault in any way but I'm also feeling very anxious about it. So I'm posting this here for an unbiased opinion if I'm at fault or not.

TLDR
My brother and I argued about our shared room door being locked and while struggling to keep it open, it broke. My father will be extremely upset and I sent him a message before it's too late.

Update: this morning I went to check who read the message and only my stepmom did. She replied saying that it saddens her that we're adults now and still are acting this way. My father went out on the boat with my brother this morning without reading the message. Half hour after her reply, he calls me asking what happened to the door and I explained everything. I come to find out that my brother lied to him telling him that I kicked the door in. After telling him the truth I heard him semi-scolding my brother that he shouldn't be locking the door in the first place because it's not only his room. Then he told us both that whenever he goes to the hardware store we're both paying for one.

96,1e23mo9,AITA for not telling my sister she's being used?,"I 41(f) have a sister (47) f who has a now ex-fianc√© (45) M who is a piece of doodoo. I know I can't fix everything for her and she has to do herself but it hurts to watch her go through this and I just want to scream.

So, I'm coming here to see if I'm the AH for waiting for the right time to speak my mind.

My sister got out of a bad relationship in 2017, by 2021 she wanted to try again going on a few failed blind dates. After which she decided to try her co-worker who SHE THOUGHT was handsome. After the first date she seemed to be under a spell, she thought she was in love. The family tried to warn her that maybe she was moving too fast, but none of our words could break her bubble, so we decided to hold our tongues for the time being. Over the next few months she was with him day and night, besides work she was stuck to him like velcro.

I was never a fan of his, he was in his 40's and didn't have a car, barely held a job and didn't seem to have any ambition. Just wading through life. Which, if that how someone wants to live their life, that's their choice. But, he was obviously leeching off of her and seemed to have some type of control over her and how she spent her money. He he moved into her apartment not long after, leaving the apartment he shared with 4-6 roommates. He barely contributed to household duties or finances, as he didn't have a steady job.

Fast forward 2 years, he proposes, which she finds out he did out of guilt so she cancels but then he affirms that he really wants to marry her so she concedes. (RED FLAG - i held my words cause she was hurting)

She starts to plan for the wedding little by little, then hired a wedding planner because she didn't want to leave anything out. She got a dress, planned for months, he picked the pic and sent out the invites to **EVERYONE**, two days later to tell her he doesn't know if he wants to marry her.

I can't begin to express the heartache I heard in her voice.

He moved out for a week, staying with a friend but then weaseled his way back in saying, that's not what he meant, i I was overwhelmed, blah, blah, blah (BIG RED FLAG - again I said nothing, I didn't think she'd listen anyway) and I feel  like the AH for keeping my mouth shut while he is obviously manipulating her.

Then he wanted a fast food chain that's only in the mall. Fine we go to mall he's fine with walking through there to get to the food court. We eat and then when we were leaving he wanted to have another smoke break. Fine we wait for him. Then he starts talking with some random man trying to spread church pamphlets. They talk religion for over an hour, not exaggerating. I asked him once nicely if we could please go now. It was already 8:00 and we still had a 2 hr drive home. He said coming. So we wait.

Both immigrants and DIY people as we grew up lower middle class. They have always expected me (21 M) to work for them my whole life (as in helping with house work, fixing cars, lawn care etc.). When I finally graduated Highschool, I was going to become a mechanic but my father forced me to go to college and study engineering. This did end up working out as I have fallen in love with the degree and work that comes with it. But due to pursuing this degree and having to pay for school, I never have time to enjoy life and do as much, as I‚Äôm always studying or working. 

My father started building a house himself and is doing alot of the work himself. I rarely have time to help him as he always asks the night before or morning of to help work on something which typically takes a few hours. Whenever he asks for support with something for the new house, it‚Äôs always last minute. 

I have helped him a few times with this house. I helped set up the barrier to prevent mud going into the street, piping in the basement, moving the footings for garage wall back, cleaned the entire street to prevent him from getting fines from the city (delivery truck left debris down the entire street roughly 200 yards), and a few other things here and there. Some of these tasks have hurt my grades. For example, the garage footings we moved back was an emergency and I had a final exam the next morning so I missed out on a few hours of studying and struggled to stay focused as between the garage and working my actual job, I was exhausted. 

We have began getting into huge fights because I help my mother, grandmother, friends or so on when I have time. He feels I give everyone priority over him. Now the problem for me is, everyone else understands my schedule isn‚Äôt the best and they give me a heads up, 4-5 days and ask what is the best time available to help them with some project. So we are able to plan ahead and I can still support with what my close friends and family need. But since my dad is always asking so last minute, I‚Äôm always forced to say no as I have to complete some homework assignment, study for exams, or help someone else with something. I know I could cancel on others but that just doesn‚Äôt seem right with me if it was planned in advance.

My father does support me financially with car insurance, phone bill, and I‚Äôm under his medical insurance. He feels his support financially gives him grounds that he should take priority over everyone else. The arguements and fighting is nonstop. I will admit, we are both hard headed and never apologize to one another so we just end up not speaking to each other for a couple of weeks. I hope I was able to write this out as non-bias as possible. AITA? Should I do more to support him? I understand building a house is difficult and time consuming but should his choices cause me to stop helping others as much or focus on school as much?

107,1e22eoc,AITA for not taking care of his dog,"A few months ago I moved to a different
state to live out my own life but due to
legal reasons had to move back to live
with my father and his girlfriend He and
his girlfriend have a history of drug
addiction he had this addiction for years
and he hasn't stopped even after he went
to rehab and jail multiple times He got a
dog around the time I moved it I was fine
with this at first even if I disagreed with
him having such a big dog in a small
cramped apartment However I made it
clean I want no responsibility for the dog
because of my own pet I thought he could
manage to take care of his dog with his
girlfriend however that's not the case 

It soon became clear that my father is
unable to take care of the dog properly, he
brings around friends at odd hours of the
night and parties with them till super late
into tue night. He does drugs and drinking
with them all while hid dog is barking at
them and tries to bite his friends showing
aggressive behavior no trained animal
would show After these nights I often find
him slumping over the couch his head
filled with sweat and his clothes smelling
disgusting He leaves the house a mess
but doesn't clean up after himself he
expects his girlfriend to clean after him
and she does this with no question If he's
not on drugs or making a mess then he's
in his room for hours of the day without
cleaning up his messes or taking care of
the dog 

Furthermore, his treatment of the dog is abusive. He was so insistent on getting
this dog but leaves the dog at home all
day and doesn't pick up the mess when
the dog eats out of the trash, he often
yells at the dog for minor things and when
that happens he leaves the dog in the
kennel all day. He feeds it at odd hours
such as too early in the morning (6 AM) or
too late at night(3 AM)or sometimes the
dog's feeding time is sporadic, He doesn't
have a schedule for the dog, just takes it
out on walks spontaneously. He doesn't
even play with it or bath it, he leaves it
alone all day. 

Now that I'm about to move out he expects me to take care of the dog and
handle his responsibilities of cleaning the
house. I don't think I should be
responsible for his dog since he was the
one who wanted a big dog and didn't care
about my ""opinions"" when I told him he
shouldn't have a dog at this time, I was
told by my mother and sister that if I didn't
take care of the dog and step in for him,
then I was a heartless bad person, and
told me I didn't care for animals. That I'm
a huge asshole and should care for all
animals, am I the asshole for not wanting
to take care of responsibility for his dog?
Should I take care of his dog?",Not the A-hole,2024-07-13,"AITA for not taking care of his dog A few months ago I moved to a different
state to live out my own life but due to
legal reasons had to move back to live
with my father and his girlfriend He and
his girlfriend have a history of drug
addiction he had this addiction for years
and he hasn't stopped even after he went
to rehab and jail multiple times He got a
dog around the time I moved it I was fine
with this at first even if I disagreed with
him having such a big dog in a small
cramped apartment However I made it
clean I want no responsibility for the dog
because of my own pet I thought he could
manage to take care of his dog with his
girlfriend however that's not the case 

It soon became clear that my father is
unable to take care of the dog properly, he
brings around friends at odd hours of the
night and parties with them till super late
into tue night. He does drugs and drinking
with them all while hid dog is barking at
them and tries to bite his friends showing
aggressive behavior no trained animal
would show After these nights I often find
him slumping over the couch his head
filled with sweat and his clothes smelling
disgusting He leaves the house a mess
but doesn't clean up after himself he
expects his girlfriend to clean after him
and she does this with no question If he's
not on drugs or making a mess then he's
in his room for hours of the day without
cleaning up his messes or taking care of
the dog 

Furthermore, his treatment of the dog is abusive. He was so insistent on getting
this dog but leaves the dog at home all
day and doesn't pick up the mess when
the dog eats out of the trash, he often
yells at the dog for minor things and when
that happens he leaves the dog in the
kennel all day. He feeds it at odd hours
such as too early in the morning (6 AM) or
too late at night(3 AM)or sometimes the
dog's feeding time is sporadic, He doesn't
have a schedule for the dog, just takes it
out on walks spontaneously. He doesn't
even play with it or bath it, he leaves it
alone all day. 

Now that I'm about to move out he expects me to take care of the dog and
handle his responsibilities of cleaning the
house. I don't think I should be
responsible for his dog since he was the
one who wanted a big dog and didn't care
about my ""opinions"" when I told him he
shouldn't have a dog at this time, I was
told by my mother and sister that if I didn't
take care of the dog and step in for him,
then I was a heartless bad person, and
told me I didn't care for animals. That I'm
a huge asshole and should care for all
animals, am I the asshole for not wanting
to take care of responsibility for his dog?

108,1e22dft,AITA for constantly questioning my friend's loyalty that I've know for over a year?,"Feels weird to ask questions here so much but i have nowhere else i can go to lol.

anyways, I (17F) have been friends with this guy in my class (17M) for over a year now. Let's call him Patrick. When we became friends, we had a lot of rumors surrounding us that we were a thing. It was all fun and games until he started hinting that he likes me. So while casually flirting around one day I asked if he liked me and he said he did. In a very roundabout way at that. His response should've been a red flag in itself but I chose to ignore it. 

He would always say he stopped flirting around with other people but won't date me cuz given how busy we were, we might not have had time for each other. Fast forward to valentines, he asked if i could come over and hangout with him and other friends and since we live far i couldn't come. that day we had an occasion all over the state and I decided i'd visit my old school. which ended in a tragedy and i came back home crying under my sunglasses. that day in particular he kept leaving me on read. and when i came back home and went to text him i saw pictures of him and his supposedly close 'friend' (lets call her Poppy 18F) hugging, holding hands and walking. and coincidentally they were wearing matching outfits. 

given our mutual feelings, i thought he had eyes only for me and that's when i really started to question him. i got insecure everytime i saw those two getting touchy with each other. Poppy is a petite girl and even though Patrick would say he liked my shape better, i always found him being drawn to her. again fast forward to last night. he said he wanted to show me something on insta. since i dont have an account he offered that i login into his and check it out. after seeing what he wanted to show me i asked if i could take a look around his stuff. 

i opened the dms and saw Poppy's account. I asked if i could open it and he was like ""sure but you'll only see a wall of reels lol"". when i opened it, i scrolled up and saw two reels that caught my eye. one said ""how to say ily in japanese"" and the other said ""that one female friend who gives gf vibes"" both of which he sent me too and at the same day at that. i asked him what this was about and instead of giving me a clear explanation he said ""if you dont trust me block me, i told you we don't have anything, gf vibes means closer than a friend, if you still can't trust me after knowing me for a year just block me."" 

it's not that i don't trust him, it's more that whenever i had my doubts he'd laugh it off and not give me a clear answer. i trusted him but also didn't at the same time and all i needed was one clear answer. he lives an hour away from me by car so there's no way of knowing what he does behind my back and frankly, i can't say anything cuz i'm not even his partner. so aita?",Asshole,2024-07-13,"AITA for constantly questioning my friend's loyalty that I've know for over a year?

113,1e21zl5,AITA for watching a YouTube let's play in my parents' big TV?,"So I (29m) and my sister (29f) were visiting my parents' place for our birthday over the past weekend. And there were maybe 1-2 hours when it was just me and her in the house. My sister was coming down with a cold so she decided to take a nap on the couch, while I decided to turn on my parents' large TV and connect my YouTube account to watch some videos quietly. I turned on a new upload from a gaming youtuber we both enjoyed, and I began to doze off myself.

 About 30 or so minutes into the video, my mom comes in from getting a haircut and showers and begins making dinner. While she's making dinner, she suddenly says, ""Are you actually watching this?"" To which I respond yes, thinking maybe it was too loud I just turned the volume down a little bit. My mom then says, ""You don't find this extremely irritating to watch?"" I said no and told her my sister and I would always watch each other play games, and it's free to watch, so I'm not spending money on video games all the time. After a little while, I changed the video to cute and funny pet videos. 

What makes me a little angry about this exchange is that if she wanted us to change the channel, she could've just asked. This is her home, her TV, she didn't have to make the exchange so harsh. The whole exchange just made me feel like an asshole for hogging up the TV with some video game content instead of my dad's usual 24hr news cycle of a ""news"" program favored by American conservatives (which my mom hates as well) I think it's pretty reasonable to say I'm not the asshole but maybe I missed something.

He was used as a slave for his family and all the money he made in the ‚Äúfamily business‚Äù until he got married to me (when he was 25) his parents kept. We got married and he had zero dollars to his name. He worked his butt off during his teenage years and early adulthood basically to support his parents and siblings. His parents sold his car and all his valuables and kept the money after we got married. They didn‚Äôt approve of us marrying because  they knew their cash cow was leaving and now they had to manage themselves. We moved as far away from them as possible. 


Since then he went to college got his degree and managed to do everything debt free. A few years after we got married his mom got into a pickle financially and owed some money to debt collectors. My husband offered to help her out and gave her the money no strings attached, it was a gift not a loan. This totaled about 3K. This helped get her out of a pickle, her dad passed and left her a sizable inheritance in the following years so she is set. 


Fast forward to currently, covid hit and it was a bumpy 3 years for us, we have minimal savings. We were fine until one of his big contracts decided to back out on him. So now he owed 5k and they wanted the money right away and were getting lawyers involved. We couldn‚Äôt afford lawyers so he decides to ask him mom for a loan. He has full intentions of paying everything back and actually has been. He owes her now less than 2K.

Here is where I may be the ah because I told her I just found it sad that after he was used all those years as free labor, and how he helped her get out of her financial crisis I would assumed it would have been the nicer thing to do to was just gift him the money. 

That‚Äôs basically what I said verbatim. She got upset and said I was being entitled. I don‚Äôt know I am super conflicted because I would never expect anyone to give me anything for free.

I told my husband my feelings and he said he understands where I am coming from but that, that has to come from his parents to be a gift and he doesn‚Äôt expect anything. 

I would like to clarify, I would never actively go and tell my mil my feelings on the matter, she ASKED me what my feelings were and I told her my feelings about it.

It was a year before they started dating, we had free period on that day so the class was noisy. My best friend and i were sitting together in front while almost half the boys in the class including some girls were at the back of the class. My best friend‚Äôs boyfriend was part of that crowd. My best friend and I decided to sit closer to them since we had nothing else to do. When we got there I discovered that the boys were ranking the girls in our grade based on the bodies, and me being the person i am, i told them that it was disgusting what they were doing. That‚Äôs when he turned to me and i said ‚Äú you should be happy cuz you were put second ‚Äú. At that point i was really angry and eventually started crying.  

That was the main reason why I didn‚Äôt like him but also the fact that he was really shitty and sexist. So imagine my surprise when my best friend told me they were dating. I was shocked but I tried to be supportive cuz she looked happy with him. But no matter what i just cannot seem to get along with him or even pretend to like him it just cringes me out.

I was shocked but I tried to be supportive cuz she looked happy with him. But no matter what i just cannot seem to get along with him or even pretend to like him it just cringes me out. And it seems as though everyone forgot about what happened and are saying im being mean to him for no reason.

116,1e21azr,AITA if I uninvite my SIL from my baby shower because she‚Äôs infertile and is always sad about whenever we talk about babies?,"I (28F) am 29 weeks pregnant with fraternal twins (a boy and a girl). I was lucky enough to get pregnant almost immediately after going off birth control. My SIL (38F), who I‚Äôll call Jane, has fertility issues and has not been able to have a baby after more than a decade of trying and multiple rounds of IVF. 

A few days ago, my family all came over to my house to hang out. I told them that I finished decorating my nursery and my mom, sister, and other SIL all wanted to see it so I took them in to see it. Jane looked unhappy when I mentioned the nursery and said she‚Äôd rather not see it. She went out to the porch while we went inside. We stayed in the nursery for a while and eventually Jane came in because it was too hot outside. 

We were talking about babies (sister and other SIL both have young children) and Jane looked a bit uncomfortable with the conversation. My sister said that I was really lucky to get pregnant with twins right after I started trying. After that, Jane started crying and left the room. We all went after her to talk to her and she said she feels awful having to constantly hear about our babies. 

She went on a long rant about how she feels excluded because she‚Äôs the only one of us without a child now. She thinks our mom treats her like she‚Äôs less than my sister and other SIL because they have kids and now that I‚Äôm pregnant, we don‚Äôt talk about anything but kids. She said it‚Äôs insensitive when we know that she‚Äôs infertile. She was like this for all of my sister and SIL‚Äôs pregnancy. 

She insists on coming to all the gender reveals and baby showers and birthday parties but spends all her time there wallowing in her misery and even starts crying sometimes. I kind of want to uninvite her from my baby shower next week because I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôll ruin the vibe. WIBTA if I did that. I feel bad for her, but she can‚Äôt keep bringing negativity to all of our celebrations. I told my mom that I want to uninvite her and she said I shouldn‚Äôt because she‚Äôs family and we need to support her instead of excluding her even more.

117,1e2133f,AITA for not being a supportive gf?,"I, 20F just got in a heated argument with my medium distance bf, Doug, 20M. Doug and I met at school where we both participate in cross country. Doug is from a smaller town and has limited options for coaching but grew up working with Liam, 34M. Liam has always been great with Doug and has really helped him. 

This past fall, right before Doug and I started dating, Doug invited me to travel to a big race about 45 minutes away and meet Liam. I was excited. I really liked Doug. The whole short trip was really fun and I enjoyed getting to meet Liam. 

Flash forward to spring and Doug and I have been dating for 5 months. Liam attends one of Doug's races and meets my immediate family and we all hang out with Doug's family. Everyone loves Liam. 

When school ended for summer, Doug and I went back to our home towns, around a 4 hour drive. We both helped coach youth in our respective towns and hung out on weekends. I was talking with my coach about Doug and I happened to mention Liam. My coach's face drained of all color and he said I should google Liam. I was very confused but did so. Turns out Liam had been charged with 3 counts of battery against children and 1 count of child corn. He had not yet been convicted. 

When I spoke with Doug that night, I expressed how I was a bit upset that I had not been told of the charges. Doug immediately went on the defensive and kept going on about how he didn't support Liam's possible actions but only wanted to support Liam's family (a wife and 6 kids) and honestly all he talked to Liam about was cross country so none of it affected him. I told Doug he could do whatever he wanted but I would never financially support someone with these charges against them. Doug started crying and hit a wall multiple times. He has been known to do this and I have always told him how much I hated it. I ended up hanging up the phone and told him to call me back when he was done hitting things. 5 minutes later he called me back with his mom who kept telling me I have no right to feel upset because Liam was not yet convicted and her children are not gossips. Doug just cried. I explained to her that I felt I should have been told before I traveled with Doug to meet him and introduced him to my family. She said her family had a discussion 2 years ago when the charges first came out and they had decided they would do nothing unless Liam was convicted. I asked her if her family was allowed to make that choice shouldn't I be as well? She said no. Her family were not gossips and I was never in any danger since I wasn't left alone with Liam. 

Eventually she left and Doug and I argued more about how I wasn't supporting him in his decision to continue lessons until a conviction and now that Liam was going to jail he had stopped lessons. Apparently Liam was convicted a couple days ago. But I was an a-hole because I was prejudiced against a man with bad charges filed against him and that I need to be more supportive.

119,1e20mya,"AITA sponger partner(38M) tried to lord an equitable deal from the past over me(33F), so I suggested we pay bills equally. I feel like TA. ","AITA, my work truck is high mileage and I need to buy a new one. I was worrying about the mileage this morning, when my partner of 11 years jumped down my throat saying I just need to work more and that he's been working more than me for the first time ever. He keeps saying that. 

1) I pay 2.5x the bills him or his friend that lives here does. His mother pays nothing. Combined I still pay more than them. 
2) He's a musician, if he quits working I support him. No issues, no hassle. He's only contributed financially on and off for the last 6 years. 
3) He's doing well now, his friend has a good union job. It was one thing during corona virus or when he was younger. 

He brought up that he worked hard to pay off my current truck, but then ignored the fact that I paid his $400 in rent for 14 months to make it even, as agreed, and after that he quit his job and didn't pay rent anyway. I bought the truck from him as he wanted a gas efficient car and I needed a truck. 
I went to work and it just made me so angry. It's the hottest part of the year, I have a lull in business this time every summer. And it's ok because it's Texas doing physical, dangerous labor in the direct sun. I still work, but it slows down for a couple weeks. I have broken bones and been bit and smashed against walls to contribute to the bills for over a decade. He implied I didn't work hard, that I was lazy. I have never made him feel bad about not contributing. To have a fair deal we made in the past lorded over me like a fair deal is something to be ashamed of, just pissed me off and I thought- maybe it's time we all split the bills fairly and I can get a new truck, because my work makes the money. 
When he got home I was still upset. I tried to play it off but he kept pushing asking why it looked like I'd been crying. I kept just saying, it was hot outside today, I got weak and threw up, I'm tired. But then he said ""it's because I paid off your truck isn't it"" 

And then I basically just said what I told you guys. He's mad, he's acting like I only care about money. Like it's unreasonable, like I need a huge amount right now, and that he'll have to pawn all his things. This whole situation is because I hate fighting about money. I'd rather just pay it all and avoid it most times, which is how I get in these situations.

I have 3 bio kids (21, 18, 10) and he has 7 bio kids, none of which are ours together. We have most of the kids every weekend, holidays, time off from school, etc and try to be be as involved with all of their lives as possible. I pay all our household bills (mortgage, electric, car payments, etc) as I have a steady salary and we live off my husbands income (trips, groceries, gas, Christmas, birthdays, etc) as he's self employed so his incomes isn't as expected as mine, it works for us for the most part. I generally go along with maintaining equality amongst all 10 kids even tho I don't agree with it at times, like at Christmas when he thinks all the kids should get equal gifts and I think my kids should get more (side note I was a single mom before meeting him, I haven't had communication with my kid's bio dad in almost 10 years, I get no financial support and never have, not even sure if he's alive tbh, all they have is me) as his kids will get Christmas with their moms and then with us, mine won't. He says that's not fair and not his kids fault, that were one family so whatever, I've let it go. Now for the main, most recent problem. I have multiple very sizable life insurance policies on myself and as we recently got married, at open enrollment I was able to get a policy on him and we needed to fill out papers for it. He noticed on the paperwork that for my policies, the beneficiaries are him and my three children, him getting 40% and my kids each getting 20% and that for his policy I'm the sole beneficiary. He is upset saying that he should either get 100% of mine and he'll disperse it amongst all the kids or that I lessen the amount my kids get and share it equally among all of them, to which I refused saying it's their moms responsibility to leave them life insurance, not mine. He followed up with wanting me to include his kids on his policy since mine are on mine and again, I refused, I'm paying for the policy and it's a very small policy, and wouldn't leave very much left after a funeral is paid for anyways. He's mad and thinks ITA. Am I? Should I just add all the kids? I do want ""one big happy blended family"" but also, I'm ALL MY KIDS HAVE, and it's my responsibility to take care of THEM. AITA? 
Edit: as there seems to be a lot of people thinking I make more than my husband and he's ""living off of me"" he is not, he makes nearly the same or slightly more than me yearly but due him owning his own business he doesn't get a steady base salary, I do, hence why my salary pays all the household bills.

121,1e20fih,AITA for taking my sister's cat?,"I know how the title sounds, but I promise it's not like that.

This all started when my sister decided to go on vacation, she didn't tell anybody except my mom. The only way I knew was from a couple of pictures from her private story.

I originally thought nothing of it, but I did start worrying about her cat. I called her and asked her who was taking care of her cat, to which she replied, "" no one, don't worry about it. ""

How was I supposed to NOT worry about her cat after that? I even called my mom and my dad to see if they could care for the cat, since I lived 2 hours away and didn't wanna drive there everyday.

They both said they were too busy to care for the cat, and that I should just do it instead if I cared so much. Like I said though, I live 2 hours away.

I'm not sure what went through my head, but I decided to just straight up take the cat home with me. I messaged my sister that her cat was at my house, she left me on seen so I just assumed she didn't care.

Literally a whole week later, I get woken up by banging on my front door. It startled me but I went to open it, I was greeted by my sister and my mom.

I assumed they were just here for the cat, and told them to come her so I could fetch him. As soon as I brought the cat out, she went literally ballistic on me.

She was screaming about how I was a cat-stealer, and took him without warning. I, of course, defended my name and told her that I messaged her I took her cat, I even showed her the message and the fact she saw it.

She of course was crying that she didn't see it and that I must've installed something, not sure how that'd work.

After about 30 minutes of arguing my mom got fed up, and practically dragged my sister and her cat out my house.

I thought it was over, until 2 days later, I got off work and immediately saw over 30 messages from close family. I assumed someone had died by how many there were, but nope. 

Turns out my sister just told everyone she knew that I stole her cat, which again I DIDN'T do. At first I was just defending my name, but to be honest it kinda got to me which made me think maybe I was an asshole for taking her cat. 

I told her where her cat was, and that she could come pick it up whenever, but I should've called instead or something.

I assumed they were just here for the cat, and told them to come her so I could fetch him. As soon as I brought the cat out, she went literally ballistic on me.

She was screaming about how I was a cat-stealer, and took him without warning. I, of course, defended my name and told her that I messaged her I took her cat, I even showed her the message and the fact she saw it.

She of course was crying that she didn't see it and that I must've installed something, not sure how that'd work.

After about 30 minutes of arguing my mom got fed up, and practically dragged my sister and her cat out my house.

I thought it was over, until 2 days later, I got off work and immediately saw over 30 messages from close family. I assumed someone had died by how many there were, but nope. 

Turns out my sister just told everyone she knew that I stole her cat, which again I DIDN'T do. At first I was just defending my name, but to be honest it kinda got to me which made me think maybe I was an asshole for taking her cat. 

I told her where her cat was, and that she could come pick it up whenever, but I should've called instead or something.

Soo, AITA for taking my sister's cat?",0.0,0.9687406420707703,1,0

When i got diagnosed and went to therapy at the same time we were able to figure out when i get overstimulated and overwhelmed i tend to get frustrated. Im sensitive to sounds and pitches, heat, lights smells and texture. The thing with my mom is she likes to make a lot of sounds when trying to act funny and it makes me overwhelmed. She likes to tease me and the teasing then makes me feel like shit because i have a hard time understanding jokes, especially her jokes. If i did something i am not happy about or i stutter, she will tease it. I will get more angry and she wont stop until im yelling in which she would go ‚Äúsheesh, im just kidding, calm down.‚Äù 
She likes to say ‚Äúi cant do anything right around you‚Äù and ‚Äúseems i can only make you mad‚Äù and it guilt trips me. 

I have told her several times about how certain things she does overstimulates me and she says she gets it then continues a bit later. 
I can only sit in the car with her with headphones in which is good ‚Äúbye bye‚Äù to signal im putting them on. 

When i confront her on how she makes me feel about more serious issues we have she becomes defensive and shuts down. I have issues identifying emotions and feelings that i experience until its obvious, which is due to past trauma and being on the spectrum (Cant tell im sad until im crying, cant tell im happy until im laughing, etc). i cannot say ‚Äúi love you‚Äù due to it being uncomfortable because idk if i do, which she accepts mostly. She sometimes says ‚Äúwell you do this and it means you love me‚Äù when in reality im doing it to either keep me y busy or to keep peace (Cooking us dinner or rubbing her back). I have flat face mostly (cant show expressions on face) due to trauma and autism. 

She recognizes that my struggle with emotions, love and my flat face is due to the trauma i went through but still gets upset when i don‚Äôt show emotions or love or express myself. 

Since i was a baby i didnt like her, of course i would go to her when hurt but i hated being held by her unless it was time for bed. I leaned more to my brother and thought of him as my parent figure more than her. Which i dont know if she knows that. 

In all, she makes me feel like shit for how i am with her, and points out how her mom and step mom was worse before she got adopted. Yet she says ‚Äúblood is blood‚Äù and is still in contact with her mom who i stated i dont want contact with for how she has treated me. My nana has been horrible to me and then wither gives me money or sends me things as if it would fix everything just to repeat it. Meanwhile my mom dotes on my brother yet i know if i was in the same situation as him shed treat me differently than him. 

I spoken to her about this many times but she doesnt understand in the end. What do i do because everything she does only overwhelms then frustrates me.

123,1e2025w,AITA for not putting any effort into a relationship with my brother until he apologizes?,"I (30's M) have two brothers, the older Peter (30's) and Chris (30's).

For almost a decade now, Peter has been nasty and confrontational with me regarding me dropping out of playing video games online with him and Chris, due to how he acted during them. 

Since then, there have been a number of different ways I tried to have some kind of relationship, and while I wasn't perfect, Peter wasn't blameless. Though he blamed me for all the issues.

This blew up \~5 years ago at Chris' wedding. Prior to the event our father had told us both separately, that we were the reasonable one and we needed to make sure that the other didn't make a scene at the wedding. The result of this was me doing my best to avoid Peter when I could. While Peter spammed me with calls and texts demanding to know where I was, him talking to me like a child when I wasn't reacting to him or walking away, and him doing his best to prevent me from talking with the bride and groom. Afterwards, On the trip back (I gave him a ride to the venue as we lived relatively close to each other and it was a \~10 hrs trip) he shouted at me that others were seeing how unreasonable I was and I needed to play video games with him and nothing else would suffice. I offered other things like calls, camping trips, going to movies etc, but they were all shot down. 

I decided to grant his wish. As I won't play with him, I won't have any other relationship with him. So I only respond briefly when he reaches out around birthdays and nothing else.

It wasn't till later that I figured out what our father had done and had a confrontation with him where he said he was tired of how we acted around each other and I needed to suck it up when he said stuff about me.

Later I had conversations with my parents when they wanted me to forgive him that I wouldn't until he of his own volition apologizes for any of his actions.

Since then he has seemingly calmed down and not made any snide comments or the like in the rare times we meet, but I've held firm on my stance as I've interacted with him for less than 48 hrs total in that time. Additionally, both of my siblings have had kids since, and I only really interact with Chris' family, including making handmade gifts for them. Though I am not ignoring my nibbling on the other side, they will get a similar monetary gift when they graduate that my other nibblings will get.

Our grandma (85F) made her mom raise my dad, she was in and out of his life , because she went off to get married to someone else start new family with him.

During my dad chemotherapy treatment he always asked for grandma to visit him, she always made excuses her kids/grandkids were to busy to bring her, she was busy, her husband was busy, she wasn't feeling good,When dad funeral came she said she couldn't bring herself to come.


Recently she lost her husband, she's no longer able to pay bills, none of her kids wanna take her in.
Her kids want to put her  in nursing home, 

she got contact with my mom and brother, told them her situation my mom feeling pity for her let her move into her house.

When my brother told me about her moving in mom house, i got furious drove there.
When I walked in I saw her,mom and my brother all talking,

I pointed at her told her to get out, mom tried to tell me to calm down
But I kept telling her to get out since she's not welcome here, 

Grandma tried using her situation on me but i told her I didn't care since she wasn't there for dad lowest time,
She doesn't deserve for us to be there for her in her lowest.

Mom firmly told me to  either get out or calm down So I left her house.

Later on that night i received text message from my mom and brother my mom texted  me saying she understands my pain but grandma is still family.

My brother texted message said I need to stop being selfish since this is want dad would've wanted when he was still alive.

A couple months after getting married, we bought a house. During the moving process, I found a bunch of old photo albums full of my childhood photos I had stashed away. We spent a night going through them and at one point flipped to a photo of me age 10/11 at the local pool in our hometown, standing next to the lifeguard tower with a male teenage lifeguard sitting in the chair. When we flipped to it, it made me laugh and I told my husband the story behind it. 

As a kid, I had a huge crush on the guy in the photo. For 3-4 years, I would spend every summer doing ""cool"" things in the pool (read: uncool things that little me thought was going to make him fall in love with me?) like underwater cartwheels and handstands. The photo was taken during one of my last trips to the pool before my family moved, I had begged my mom to take it because I was never going to see him again. 

It turns out I did see him again. Not only that but I married him. My husband is literally the lifeguard I had a crush on growing up. We found photos in his albums of him working and it is 100% him. He said he even remembers me a little bit because he whistled at me once for running on the pool deck and I burst into tears (I did). 

We laughed and told our parents and then at some point just moved on, until last week when I heard him mentioning it to some of our friends at a July 4th party. He wasn't making fun of me or teasing, just explaining that we had this invisible string connecting us years before we ever met, but I didn't like other people knowing about it.

129,1e1zb5a,AITA for Telling a Teenage Boy I Don't Know to Leave Local Wildlife Alone ,"I am still replaying this and am not sure if I did the right thing. I have never confronted a complete stranger about anything and I'm wondering if I should have or just kept my mouth shut.

I (F44) am on vacation with my family. I was sitting on the beach with my nieces (7 & 8) when we spotted this cute crab, who came out of his hole and started walking sideways along the water. He was about 4‚Äù long, so not a tiny sand crab or hermit crab, but also not large. My nieces were mesmerized watching him poke his periscope eyes out of the water when a wave would crash over him and then continue on his way.

He started walking by another group. Some of them were looking at him and taking pictures, but then a teenage boy (between 16-18) decided to start messing with him and trying to pick him up. This bothered me because I believe animals living in their natural habitats should be left alone, but I didn't say anything because I figured the kid would learn soon enough if he got pinched that it was a bad idea to pick up crabs for no reason.

Here's where it went south. The kid took a flip flop and threw it down on the crab. It looked as if he were trying to smash it. My nieces looked horrified, and because it happened so fast and I wasn't thinking, I reacted out loud:

Me: What are you doing?!

Teenager: What? I'm just trying to pick it up!

Me: It looked like you were trying to smash him!

Teenager: I just want to pick it up!

Me: Why?

Young Female in His Group: Because he can! (Others agree)

Me: You need to leave the crab alone.

Young Female again: Who are you to tell him what he can or can't do!

Me: You shouldn't be messing with wildlife.
(not the most clever response, but I wasn't exactly prepared to argue with a stranger about this.)

At this point, I stepped back because I wasn't looking for a fight, but the boy continued to try to pick up the crab. He succeeded and was dangling the little guy in front of his group and cheering that he got him. Frankly, I was furious but knew that no one in that group cared, which made me even more mad, so I mouthed that the kid was a mother f-ing moron. I didn't say it out loud, but it was visible to some of those in his group. I admit this part was wrong, and I should not have resorted to name calling. I went and sat down, and thankfully he let the crab go eventually.

A couple minutes later, his mother approached me while I was in my beach chair and furiously called me out for telling her kid what to do, saying I had no business telling him anything and if I said one more word to him we'd have a problem. I tried to explain to her that it looked like he was trying to crush the crab, but she didn't want to hear it and basically told me to stay where I was.

AITA for saying something? I do regret mouthing the name that I did, but was I in the wrong for intervening in the first place and telling him to leave the crab alone?
",Not the A-hole,2024-07-13,"AITA for Telling a Teenage Boy I Don't Know to Leave Local Wildlife Alone  I am still replaying this and am not sure if I did the right thing. I have never confronted a complete stranger about anything and I'm wondering if I should have or just kept my mouth shut.

I (F44) am on vacation with my family. I was sitting on the beach with my nieces (7 & 8) when we spotted this cute crab, who came out of his hole and started walking sideways along the water. He was about 4‚Äù long, so not a tiny sand crab or hermit crab, but also not large. My nieces were mesmerized watching him poke his periscope eyes out of the water when a wave would crash over him and then continue on his way.

132,1e1yfml,"AITA FOR CALLING MY ROOMMATE A ""KNOW-IT-ALL B**TCH""","I've been having issues with this nosy roommate (36 F) of ours.

I (26 F) am currently 8 weeks pregnant and had taken a leave due to subchorionic hemorrhage found in my ultrasound. My OB suggested bed rest for 3 weeks. 

When we move in, I was on leave when due to my 1st miscarriage and she would say things like, ""How could you'd be on LOA when you just started working?"" 

Why would anyone from my company forced me to go to work when I just had a miscarriage? She would then compare it to when she was allowed to have LOA because she already reach her six month probation. I was flabbergasted but tried telling her that since it was for health reasons, my company was okay with that.

When I was absent for work because of my UTI, she would say things like, ""In our company, this would guarantee a warning for termination,"" and I would tell her our company has different set of rules and was okay with absences so long as i have medical certificate.

When I passed her company's interview, She would tell me this, ""I have a co-worker who is Bisaya like you, (one of the languages in the PH) and her English accent was hard. That would make it difficult for you when you started in training because of your accent, right?"" And I was Like ""??""

I may be Bisaya but not all us spoke with a hard English accent like she would assume. We are all different and unique in our own ways, some have valley girl accent which I do, and some have neutral accent. How could she say those things to me who already have a customer service experience?

I stop responding to her remarks on me. I just withdraw my application and decided to stay at my current company. I'd rather stay there than to be working with someone like her.

One time, I used her insecticide and forgot to put it back to the shelf. When she found out I used it, she lashed out on my boyfriend on chat.

She said, ""I told you to touch your things. I dont like people using my things,""

I understand that it was a mistake that I shouldnt used it even if its for OUR room. Still, she can speak to me about it since I'm home, but she refused to confront me even after my bf (29 M) told her to talk to me directly.

I know I am an assh**e for not reaching out first but my bf said to let it aside since she did not want to confront me either. Now imagine my shock when she suddenly send a text to him asking when should I come back to work because I'm only on my first TRIM and my company should not allow me to be on leave.

I told my bf she shouldn't stuck up on my business. I didnt even ask personal questions about her life. Before this, she texted my bf asking if I lost my job cause I am not going to work then bf told her I am on leave. Now, she was saying absurd things about me and my company. 
I'm fuming. She was being too much so told my boyfriend she was a ""know-it-all b**ch"".

We both have always been humanities oriented and both pursued premed along with a arts/humanities veering major. It was something that I think drew us to each other- being dual minded and pursuing this career path. I was accepted into medical school before him, and watched him through his whole process and helped him significantly through the process - even writing most of his personal statement to a really impactful/ meaningful level that poignantly wrapped together his non science / science history well. He applied to my school, and applied for their humanities dual degree program as a means of demonstrating strong interest/ commitment to it. This rubbed me slightly wrong at the time because I was a current student of that program and it kind of did bother me that he used it as a means to an end as opposed to genuine interest that he was otherwise seeking out for himself as a career/research interest. But whatever, I still supported him and spoke to my advisors about him/ his merit to confirm his interest and capacity for the program. (Not that I think this was a competitive program to get accepted to, but still).

Anyways, he ended up waitlisted at my school, for which I wrote to my deans regarding, but eventually ended up somewhere else. He has since pursued bioethics research separately on his own. At first this excited me; this area was kind of ‚Äúmy thing‚Äù and I thought this was something we would/could collaborate on together, and work on papers together. He got in with a pretty cool research group with a wide network of mentors actively working on different projects, and I was really excited to maybe meet or be introduced to some folks. However, he was very reluctant to do so, saying it was too early / he was too new. That felt reasonable at the time to me so I shrugged it off. However, after much time passed there was still a lot of resistance to this; most recently I mentioned considering writing a paper for x topic, and he told me he had actually turned down an offer to collaborate with someone for that paper. Now this topic is for a journal we both follow, and was one I have specific interest in; I was pretty hurt that he didn‚Äôt think of me. He responded with ‚Äúbabe, work and play‚Ä¶‚Äù which made me feel really off. I‚Äôm his partner of many years. I‚Äôve never thought of him as something I would separate from networking opportunities; I would bring him as a guest for my fellowship and often taut his accomplishments and accolades to other senior members if there was a chance of professional connection between them. He is a MCAT tutor, and I‚Äôm always pitching him when my family connects with others who have kids that are premed. Whenever we went to arts events, I‚Äôd always be the first to exclaim his background in ‚Äúx‚Äù field which would always be an entry point for the other person to strike up a conversation/ form potential connection.
