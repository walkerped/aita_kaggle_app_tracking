0,1e2h3qt,AITA for blowing up at my mum?,"Me (18nb, they/them) and my mum (53f) have always had a rocky relationship. From 2015-2021 (I was 9-15), she was completing a part-time master's program while working full-time. She was basically never home, and my dad became our primary caregiver. She even skipped family outings to write her thesis, which led me to bond more with my dad than with her.

While I'm incredibly proud of her for getting her master's, it felt like she chose her education over our relationship. People around me thought she was dead because she was never present. When I was honest with her about my feelings, she'd get overwhelmed and blow up at me. She never really got to know me beyond age 9 and still sees me as the little girl I was.

It became even more difficult when I came out as non-binary. She supports me, but she only sees things from her perspective, leading to many verbal fights. For instance, my periods are terrible, causing depression and heavy cramps, but she didn't understand and called me dramatic because her experiences were different. Similarly, I used to hate my larger breasts and wanted a binder, but she couldn't understand my feelings since she always wanted bigger breasts herself. This continued until my dad sat her down. 

Despite these challenges, our relationship has improved over the last year. We've gone on a trip together, and she's been more understanding and respectful of my boundaries. However, a recent incident caused a major fight.

A few weeks ago, I found out my extremely Catholic grandma (mum's mum) had stopped putting money into a savings account she made for me when I was born. I discovered this when I finally accessed the account at 18 and saw my little brother had more money, indicating she stopped contributing around the time I came out. This hurt deeply because, despite her disapproval of my identity, I thought we were very close.

When I told my mum, she called me shallow. I tried to explain it wasn't about the money but about grandma not accepting me. This led to a fight, and I stormed out. I understand my mum's reluctance to confront grandma because they had a huge fight years ago and only reconciled when mum was pregnant with me. She's afraid of losing her mum again. However, in the moment, I got really mad and told her she was choosing grandma over me, like she chose her master's over our relationship.

I told my uncle (mum's brother) what happened and he got really mad. He has his own complicated relationship with our family as a bisexual man and called both grandma and mum to scold them for their behavior when he thought I was asleep. Since then, more and more people have been getting involved and my mum's phone has been calling non-stop. I understand that my grandma is old and set in her ways but it still really hurt she doesn't accept me. On top of that it hurt that my mum made me feel guilty for being sad and mad. 

I think my words might have ruined our relationship, but I really don't know anymore.

3,1e1xseg,AITA for asking my aunt to stop smoking at my birthday table?,"I (16M) had my birthday recently. I had invited some of my close friends to hang out and eat together. My parents invited some extended family (cousins, uncles and aunts that lived in the same town).

To give some background, in my house smoking is forbidden, and I personally believe that those rules should also apply to guests. To add onto that, I have nasal polyps that are pretty large, which mess with my hearing, my tonsils and most importantly they cause difficulty breathing. Combining that with the heat and humidity of the summer, I feel suffocated constantly, even in fresh, clean air, in non-urban zones.

At around 8-9 PM, my aunt, who wasn't even invited, but forced her ex-husband, who was invited, to take her with him and their two sons. 

She decides to sit right next to me (Our table was outdoors), which didn't bother me, but then she lights up her cigarette and starts smoking. Both me and my best friend are heavily bothered by the smoke so I ask her to not smoke while sitting at the table in the most polite way I could without seeming like cowardly (Due to having severe social anxiety when I was in middle school, which I thankfully overcame, some family members still see me as a coward and way to shy for a ""man""). She starts yelling at me saying stuff such as: ""This is how you treat guests?"", ""It's not indoors, so what's it to you?"". I respond by saying that a guest must follow the host's rules. Obviously, arguing with her would've lead nowhere so in the end me and my friends go and take a walk. I speak to my mom before leaving, telling her my point of view.

Once we come back, my mom tells me what she heard from my aunts. Apparently I'm in the wrong for bashing her and that from her point of view I was very rude and that it's her right to smoke, especially outdoors. 

My mom didn't respond and she just said that she'll talk to me, but I didn't get scolded or anything. Actually, she sided with me. After the party my father scolded me for being ""weak"" and not ""understanding how the real world functions"" after telling him that I do not want to see ever her at my home.

4,1e1xrip,AITA for cancelling my mother‚Äôs planned visit after billing me?,"My mother (65) came to visit me (39f), her daughter, after I called her to share the news I received some troubling news about my health (I‚Äôm on the mend, worst is behind me). 

She lives approximately 2 hours away from me. During the visit she signalled she planned to charge me for parking fees at the clinic she brought me to, among a couple of other expenses that she incurred helping me out that day. I was fine with that. She‚Äôs not exactly swimming in it after retiring, though has some discretionary income, and, well, I‚Äôm a grown-up. In fact, I would have taken care of the parking fees (and other expenses) myself at the time if I wasn‚Äôt incapacitated. So totally fine and expected. 


Where I stopped being fine was when she called me after the visit asking for a lot more money than I‚Äôd expected. After probing a bit, I discovered that she‚Äôd lumped in there an estimate of how much she‚Äôd spent on gas to come visit me and not just the pasta salad she bought for me at lunch (totally fine) but also the pasta salad she bought herself. I‚Äôm happy to treat her for lunch, and often do‚Äîtreated her for dinner that very night‚Äîbut I found it odd she would just go ahead and add her lunch to the bill. I hadn‚Äôt offered and aren‚Äôt I the sick one? It was only 20 bucks altogether.

 But the reason I cancelled her visit tomorrow to come over and help some more was because I couldn‚Äôt believe she‚Äôd pass on her gas expenses to her sick adult child to visit her. When she said she was coming to visit after learning of my condition, she omitted the part of her plan where she‚Äôd charge me for her gas to get here. Sure, she complained about the cost of gas when she arrived, but never did she share her plan to make me cover it. 

She‚Äôs never done anything like this before. It‚Äôs not the money. It‚Äôs the principle. And I had no intention of paying for her to visit me tomorrow, too. I plan on sharing with her my feelings about all of this once I‚Äôve given some thought to how I‚Äôll navigate it with her. I would feel so ashamed as a parent if roles were reversed. This whole thing makes me question why I haven‚Äôt billed her when I‚Äôve gone to visit her after falling ill. Of course I could never bring myself to actually do that. The thought of it makes me feel sick. So AITA for cancelling her visit? 

Edit: thank you all for weighing in. Many of you have encouraged me to probe her financial situation further, or consider her mental state. All good advice. I will do so when I speak with her about this. That said, I‚Äôm confident she is doing fine financially. While retired, she regularly goes out to lunch with her friends, sees plays, goes on a couple trips annually (she has a trip to Italy to look forward to in the Fall), etc. So while her income may be modest now that she‚Äôs retired, she‚Äôs not in dire straits financially as some of you wondered. As one commentor pointed out, she may just have a ‚Äúquirky‚Äù relationship with money. I could see that. While this is the first time that she‚Äôs billed me for her gas to visit me, she‚Äôs treated other family members like this for other expenses, despite their not treating her that way. She can get anxious, so there may be something there in terms of mental health for me to be aware of. Appreciate the comments encouraging me to look more at things from this angle. To be sure, she did visit out of love. She was terribly worried about me and genuinely wanted to look after me that day. I‚Äôll update again after having the convo with her.

7,1e1wz4m,AITA for leaving early for the train station without my friend?,"I (24M) recently went with a close friend \[let's call her\] Maddie (22F) on a short trip to the coast. We stayed for three days and everything went well, we had lots of fun and generally enjoyed our time there. However, everything went downhill on the last day when we were supposed to go back.

Very early that day, another mutual friend of ours \[let's call her\] Abbie messaged Maddie saying that she would be passing by the coast that day with a friend of hers, and that we should meet. Since we had nothing else to do while we waited for the time to catch the train to go home, we agreed to meet.

The thing was that that day it was a complete downpour, and for some reason bus services were not going around, and neither were there a lot of taxis, so we had to meet on foot along the way. It was short of miserable but funny at the same time, having to walk against the rain and the wind along the coast. At some point we eventually met, and we had to go back to dry up in a local arcade, as we were completely soaked.

While we were there, things started to turn strange to me. Both Maddie and Abbie were asking me constantly if I was okay, to which I answered I was every time, getting confused as to why they kept asking. After that, they kept to their own playing on the arcade machines. At some point I realised it was getting dangerously close to the train leaving time, and the rain wasn't stopping at all, so I stood up and tried to tell Maddie that we had to leave.

She said the didn't want to, and that she wanted to stay a little longer. I said okay and waited a few more minutes, but seeing how the rain didn't calm down at all, I approached them again and said that I would be leaving now because I wanted to dry up on the train station before the train left, and that she could catch up with me on the train station if she wanted to stay on the arcade a bit longer. She said ""Yeah, okay"", to which I said okay, so I left.

When I got to the train station, I took my phone out and saw that she had left me some messages. In short, she was in disbelief that I had ""Actually left without her"". I was very confused as we agreed to meet here, but she kept saying on how much disbelief she was and that I should be ashamed of leaving her there. I told her that I didn't see the issue at all, but that just made her get more angry and make snarky comments.  
  
At some point the conversation was going nowhere, and I was worried about how she was going to get back if she missed the train, so I kept trying to get her to meet halfway or anything that would help. She, however, decided that she would come back on a bus with the ""people I left her with"" and just continued to make snarky remarks. I got upset at this point, so I just told her ""Congratulations"" and stopped texting then.

We didn't speak again after that, and it's been a couple weeks. I'd just like to understand what went wrong and if I am the asshole in this situation. Any insight would help!",Not the A-hole,2024-07-13,"AITA for leaving early for the train station without my friend? I (24M) recently went with a close friend \[let's call her\] Maddie (22F) on a short trip to the coast. We stayed for three days and everything went well, we had lots of fun and generally enjoyed our time there. However, everything went downhill on the last day when we were supposed to go back.

Very early that day, another mutual friend of ours \[let's call her\] Abbie messaged Maddie saying that she would be passing by the coast that day with a friend of hers, and that we should meet.

8,1e1wxts,AITA for possibly getting my roommate uninvited to a party,"Me (29M) and my roommate (30M), have known each other since the 7th grade and have had the same close circle of friends since. I moved in with him about 3 years ago and things are good.  

A 29M mutual friend throws an annual house party and we are always invited. I am a bit closer to our friends as I've grown up more with them than him. With the party in mind, my roommate had been looking forward to it all year as he got to be around all our friends from school. We live in NY and our friends are in NJ for the most part so it's rare to have everyone together plus the 100+ people that show up throughout the day.  

A week before the party he had asked another mutual friend (29F) if she was going to the party. 29F was not made aware of the party and was not invited this year. This friend in particular is someone my roommate met through the host and in my opinion, he only talks to her whenever convenient.  

My roommate made me aware of the situation and while I laughed at his blunder, we realized he was in a pickle. Since I'm close to the host I reached out in a chat to help my roommate get a clear answer. I had written, ""Did you invite 29F? Because my roommate did lol"". Trying to be playful in my delivery but,I see my words were deceitful in that he did not particularly invite but made her aware of it accidentally. Still, some of us laughed.  

The host made it clear she was indeed not invited and not allowed to come. The host then showed my roommate my message and laid it flat that it was now his problem and he had to tell her she can't come even though she was already looking for a costume to wear to the party by this point. (It's Disney theme. I'm bringing the keyblade from KH.)  

After 2 days my roommate finally texted her that she can't come and that unfortunately, he doesn't make the rules. She was upset she was made aware of a party she wasn't invited to and was even more upset that the host she had known for years refused to let her be invited. My roommate was not going to fight for her spot at the party and let it go.  

29F friend had made another friend aware of this and that friend had messaged the host about it. The host had become furious to have to put up with this still and still had ultimately uninvited my roommate on the count of being ""a messy idiot"". Many of the people involved think it is weird my roommate is even talking to her since they're not really friends and he should've just brought the girl he has been seeing for months instead. 

I feel bad. Say it was another person he had asked, he probably wouldn't be uninvited. It just turns out this one person he asked was just not invited and my roommate did not know about the issues between the parties. I've asked to have his invitation reinstated since the party means a big deal to him.

9,1e1wnsz,AITA for this situation?,"Long story short, I‚Äôve a boyfriend and we are in a long distance relationship for 8 months.

So, yesterday I was supposed to have dinner with him through facetime but then he said he was going to meet a friend earlier. I‚Äôve asked him twice if he wanted to postponate but he still said he could make for the two events.

The time that we were supposed to have dinner arrived and he was still in the bar. Later, he said he ordered me food and he was going to leave but was just finishing his last beer. I asked him if he wanted to stay longer and he still said no

However, food arrived and he didn‚Äôt text me again. I‚Äôve called him, he didn‚Äôt pick up the phone. I‚Äôve sent a message asking him if we were going to eat together or not and later sent one message saying that it was fine he had to stay longer

He just said that he didn‚Äôt see my call but he could go outside if I wanted to and that his friend was challenging two random guys on snooker. Then, I‚Äôve changed my mind and decided to open up and say that I didn‚Äôt like the fact that he didn‚Äôt show up for dinner although he confirmed that he‚Äôd be there more than once and that also that lately he hasn‚Äôt pick up my calls when he‚Äôs with other people (doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs friends or family).

I do this because he currently can't afford it and I want to help him out. I don't mind giving some for free from time to time to help a friend.

A couple of days ago, my friend came over to replace my broken phone screen because he offered to help me with it. When he arrived, I gave him some weed so we could chill before he started. We chatted while he worked, and decided to hang out afterward since neither of us had plans the next day.

He finished replacing my screen around 10:30 PM and wanted to smoke to celebrate. I didn't have much left, so I offered him half so we could both roll one. He told me he wanted all of it. I said no because I needed my half for my last two joints of the day. He seemed upset, said he would go home, and declined my offer to walk to the shop together to get more. He was noticeably upset that I didn't give him all of it.

Now, I'm left with doubts. On one hand, I feel I was fair since I had been sharing my weed regularly and even offered to share half of what I had left. On the other hand, he replaced my phone screen, and maybe he felt he deserved a bit more for that.

I talked to some friends and got mixed opinions. Some think I was right to keep my half, while others feel I should have given it all since he helped me out with the phone screen.
